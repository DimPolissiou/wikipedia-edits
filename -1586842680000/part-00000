Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|Swann]]'' decision, which supported busing programs to integrate school districts to remedy ''[[de jure]]'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]], but opposed it to remedy ''[[de facto]]'' segregation, as in Delaware. He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|Swann]]'' decision, which supported busing programs to integrate school districts to remedy ''[[de jure]]'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]], but opposed it to remedy ''[[de facto]]'' segregation, as in Delaware. He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

After returning to their hometown, [[Manhattan]], while they were having a conversation about beers they started wondering which beers were drinking while back in Greece. Soon, Demetri figured out none of the beer trademarks in Greece were actually having Greek interests and almost in every country a significant rate of the inland consumption of beer was fulfilled by local breweries.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n==== Establishment and release of Vergina Beer ====\nMacedonian Thrace Brewery S.A. was founded on February 1, 1996 and the Industrial area of [[Komotini]] was selected as the seat of the company facilities due to its infrastructures, the well organised business environment and its motives. The main goal of the newly founded company was the production of the \"first Greek beer\" under the trade name \"''Vergina\"'''''.''' Thus, the construction of the brewery began and lasted until the fall of 1997. After some problems at the production, Vergina Beer finally managed to release on February 18th,1998.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite

After returning to their hometown, [[Manhattan]], while they were having a conversation about beers they started wondering which beers were drinking while back in Greece. Soon, Demetri figured out none of the beer trademarks in Greece were actually having Greek interests and almost in every country a significant rate of the inland consumption of beer was fulfilled by local breweries.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n==== Establishment and release of Vergina Beer ====\nMacedonian Thrace Brewery S.A. was founded on February 1, 1996 and the Industrial area of [[Komotini]] was selected as the seat of the company facilities due to its infrastructures, the well organised business environment and its motives. The main goal of the newly founded company was the production of the \"first Greek beer\" under the trade name \"''Vergina\"'''''.''' Thus, the construction of the brewery began and lasted until the fall of 1997. After some problems at the production, Vergina Beer finally managed to release on February 18th,1998.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite

At the beginning of each round, players are given time to either create a customized character using a character sheet or they may begin playing with a completely randomly generated character. Players can choose different jobs, such as [[janitor]] or [[engineer]], which dictate their role and responsibilities. The game is akin to a [[roleplaying]] [[sandbox game]], with events in each round largely being player-dictated.\n\nThe player can examine and use almost any object or being on the station, and is almost always context-sensitive. Different results will occur depending on many variables in any given interaction (e.g. Using a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] on another player would attack them but using it on a floorboard would pry it up). Additionally, the player can change their 'intent' between four different states (Help, Disarm, Grab, Harm) which will further influence actions taken. For example, using an empty hand on another player with help intent would cause you to hug them, but would cause you to punch them on Harm intent.\n\nThe game engine fully simulates power, biology, atmosphere, chemistry, and other complex object and environmental interactions beyond the vast majority of video games, which, to many people, compensates for its lack of visual quality and speed.\n\nWhile different [[Game server|servers]] may have their unique station constructs, generally there are eight [[Departmentalization|departments]] aboard the station. Supply and Service are also often grouped in the Civilian category.\n\n* Command (taking leadership roles aboard the station).\n* Security (enforcing [[Law|the law]], keeping peace and responding to emergencies aboard the station).\n* Engineering (generating power and keeping utilities maintained aboard the station, such as keeping doors functional and ensuring Oxygen is present around the station).\n* Science (researching technologies and developing '[[cyborg|Synthetic]]s' aboard the station).\n* Medical (keeping the crew healthy, performing most [[Surgery|surgeries]], researching [[disease]]s and creating [[Cloning|clones]] for deceased players aboard the station).\n* Supply ([[mining]] for [[minerals]] on a nearby planet, and taking charge of the cargo, such as purchasing goods for crew-members and sorting through all disposed items).\n* Service (keeping the station clean and providing food and drinks for the crew.).\n* Synthetics/Silicons (consisting of the station's [[Artificial intelligence|A.I]] and cyborgs, who are often bound by the [[Three Laws of Robotics]], which restrict AI from committing illegal acts, such as assaulting a crew member, unless someone changes said laws).\n\nOptimally, all players spawn at the beginning of each round and perform their jobs. However, randomly selected players are chosen to spawn as '[[antagonist|antagonists]]' aboard the station. Antagonists can range from mostly normal characters with certain malicious intentions, rogue [[artificial intelligence]]<nowiki/>s, and a wide assortment of monsters and enemies, such as [[Shapeshifting|changeling]]s, [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|aliens]], [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian horrors]], [[assassination|assassins]], and [[Death Squad|death squads]] armed with [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]]. It can be difficult for normal crew members to identify antagonists, and even harder to determine their objectives.\n\nDue to the presence of antagonists (and, sometimes, due to players failing at their jobs), many rounds escalate into chaos and disorder. While some communities have pre-set match timings, often rounds are concluded when the situation becomes critical and evacuation procedures are initiated.\n\n==Plot==\n\nDue to each server's lack of an agreed canonical storyline, most if not all servers have individualized lores and [[backstories]]. Generally though, Space Station 13 takes place in the 26th century on a research station owned by the [[megacorporation]] known as Nanotrasen. The station exists to research the recently discovered mineral 'plasma' (or 'phoron' on some servers), whose uses and properties Nanotrasen lacks knowledge of. Nanotrasen's influence and power have effectively made them a [[government]] entity, but is often left ambiguous as to whether they are good, evil or a neutral party (depending on the server). \n\nDue to Nanotrasen's immense stature and massive monopoly on plasma, it is targeted by an array of third-party aggressors. This includes, but is not limited to: the Syndicate (a coalition of smaller companies and planetary governments), the Space Wizard Federation (a federal group of [[thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical]] aggressors), Changelings (an extraterrestrial species with the ability to take on the form of any organic life-form they've 'absorbed') etc.\n\n==Development==\nSpace Station 13 was originally developed as an atmospherics simulator by Exadv1 in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byond.com/members/Exadv1 |title=Exadv1 - Creations |publisher=Byond.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-29}}</ref>\nIts [[Closed source software|closed source]] codebase was allegedly stolen and [[Internet leak|leaked onto the internet]] in 2006, giving rise to SS13's current popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tgstation13.org/wiki/index.php/The_history_of_SS13 |title=The history of SS13 - /tg/station 13 Wiki |publisher=Tgstation13.org |date=2015-01-14 |accessdate=2015-05-29}}</ref> However, in a 2017 interview, Exadv1 claimed no theft actually took place, as he had voluntarily given the code to fellow programmers after ceasing work on the game due to personal circumstances.<ref>{{Citation|last=BlackPantsLegion|title=Space Station 13 Interview: Exadv1 (Yes, HIM)!|date=2017-10-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP5t1b1TKQg|accessdate=2017-11-09}}</ref>\n\nA large number of promising community efforts to remake SS13 have been started over the years due to longstanding frustration with SS13's closed-source engine and low quality of code.

At the beginning of each round, players are given time to either create a customized character using a character sheet or they may begin playing with a completely randomly generated character. Players can choose different jobs, such as [[janitor]] or [[engineer]], which dictate their role and responsibilities. The game is akin to a [[roleplaying]] [[sandbox game]], with events in each round largely being player-dictated.\n\nThe player can examine and use almost any object or being on the station, and is almost always context-sensitive. Different results will occur depending on many variables in any given interaction (e.g. Using a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] on another player would attack them but using it on a floorboard would pry it up). Additionally, the player can change their 'intent' between four different states (Help, Disarm, Grab, Harm) which will further influence actions taken. For example, using an empty hand on another player with help intent would cause you to hug them, but would cause you to punch them on Harm intent.\n\nThe game engine fully simulates power, biology, atmosphere, chemistry, and other complex object and environmental interactions beyond the vast majority of video games, which, to many people, compensates for its lack of visual quality and speed.\n\nWhile different [[Game server|servers]] may have their unique station constructs, generally there are eight [[Departmentalization|departments]] aboard the station. Supply and Service are also often grouped in the Civilian category.\n\n* Command (taking leadership roles aboard the station).\n* Security (enforcing [[Law|the law]], keeping peace and responding to emergencies aboard the station).\n* Engineering (generating power and keeping utilities maintained aboard the station, such as keeping doors functional and ensuring Oxygen is present around the station).\n* Science (researching technologies and developing '[[cyborg|Synthetic]]s' aboard the station).\n* Medical (keeping the crew healthy, performing most [[Surgery|surgeries]], researching [[disease]]s and creating [[Cloning|clones]] for deceased players aboard the station).\n* Supply ([[mining]] for [[minerals]] on a nearby planet, and taking charge of the cargo, such as purchasing goods for crew-members and sorting through all disposed items).\n* Service (keeping the station clean and providing food and drinks for the crew.).\n* Synthetics/Silicons (consisting of the station's [[Artificial intelligence|A.I]] and cyborgs, who are often bound by the [[Three Laws of Robotics]], which restrict AI from committing illegal acts, such as assaulting a crew member, unless someone changes said laws).\n\nOptimally, all players spawn at the beginning of each round and perform their jobs. However, randomly selected players are chosen to spawn as '[[antagonist|antagonists]]' aboard the station. Antagonists can range from mostly normal characters with certain malicious intentions, rogue [[artificial intelligence]]<nowiki/>s, and a wide assortment of monsters and enemies, such as [[Shapeshifting|changeling]]s, [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|aliens]], [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian horrors]], [[assassination|assassins]], and [[Death Squad|death squads]] armed with [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]]. It can be difficult for normal crew members to identify antagonists, and even harder to determine their objectives.\n\nDue to the presence of antagonists (and, sometimes, due to players failing at their jobs), many rounds escalate into chaos and disorder. While some communities have pre-set match timings, often rounds are concluded when the situation becomes critical and evacuation procedures are initiated.\n\n==Plot==\n\nDue to each server's lack of an agreed canonical storyline, most if not all servers have individualized lores and [[backstories]]. Generally though, Space Station 13 takes place in the 26th century on a research station owned by the [[megacorporation]] known as Nanotrasen. The station exists to research the recently discovered mineral 'plasma' (or 'phoron' on some servers), whose uses and properties Nanotrasen lacks knowledge of. Nanotrasen's influence and power have effectively made them a [[government]] entity, but is often left ambiguous as to whether they are good, evil or a neutral party (depending on the server). \n\nDue to Nanotrasen's immense stature and massive monopoly on plasma, it is targeted by an array of third-party aggressors. This includes, but is not limited to: the Syndicate (a coalition of smaller companies and planetary governments), the Space Wizard Federation (a federal group of [[thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical]] aggressors), Changelings (an extraterrestrial species with the ability to take on the form of any organic life-form they've 'absorbed') etc.\n\n==Development==\nSpace Station 13 was originally developed in 2003 as an atmospherics simulator by Exadv1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byond.com/members/Exadv1 |title=Exadv1 - Creations |publisher=Byond.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-29}}</ref>\nIts [[Closed source software|closed source]] codebase was allegedly stolen and [[Internet leak|leaked onto the internet]] in 2006, giving rise to SS13's current popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tgstation13.org/wiki/index.php/The_history_of_SS13 |title=The history of SS13 - /tg/station 13 Wiki |publisher=Tgstation13.org |date=2015-01-14 |accessdate=2015-05-29}}</ref> However, in a 2017 interview, Exadv1 claimed no theft actually took place, as he had voluntarily given the code to fellow programmers after ceasing work on the game due to personal circumstances.<ref>{{Citation|last=BlackPantsLegion|title=Space Station 13 Interview: Exadv1 (Yes, HIM)!|date=2017-10-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP5t1b1TKQg|accessdate=2017-11-09}}</ref>\n\nA large number of promising community efforts to remake SS13 have been started over the years due to longstanding frustration with SS13's closed-source engine and low quality of code.

Subsequently, most military officers remained under-funded, having only subsistence salaries. Because of the low salaries, the military spent much time in military leisure-time facilities (e.g. [[country club]]s) where they met other officers and their families. The military remained apart from society, and was to some degree an [[Endogamy|endogamous]] group as officers frequently married the sisters of their comrades or the daughters of high-ranked older officers. Many officers had also relatives in the military.<ref name=privada/> In 1969 elements of the military made their first act of rebellion in 40 years when they participated in the [[Tacnazo insurrection]].

On 22 August, the Chamber of Deputies (with the Christian Democrats united with the National Party) accused the government of unconstitutional acts and called upon the military to enforce constitutional order.<ref name=\"Se desata la crisis\"/>\n\nFor months, the government had feared calling upon the ''[[Carabineros de Chile|Carabineros]]'' national police, suspecting them of disloyalty. On 9 August, Allende appointed General Carlos Prats as Minister of Defence. He was forced to resign both as defence minister and as the Army commander-in-chief on 24 August 1973, embarrassed by the [[Alejandrina Cox incident]] and a public protest of the wives of his generals at his house.

[with] the goal of establishing a totalitarian system\", claiming it had made \"violations of the Constitution . . . a permanent system of conduct.\" Essentially, most of the accusations were about the government disregarding the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government. Finally, the resolution condemned the ''creation and development of government-protected armed groups, which . . . are headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces''. President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterised as ''notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks''.\n\nIt can be argued that the resolution called upon the armed forces to overthrow the government if it did not comply, as follows \"...To present the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces with the grave breakdown of the legal and constitutional order ... it is their duty to put an immediate end to all situations herein referred to that breach the Constitution and the laws of the land with the aim of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law.\"<ref>[[s:Agreement of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile|English translation]] on Wikisource</ref>\n\n===President Allende's response===\nTwo days later, on 24 August 1973, President Allende responded, characterising the Congress' declaration as \"destined to damage the country\u2019s prestige abroad and create internal confusion\", predicting \"It will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors\". He noted that the declaration had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority \"constitutionally required\" to convict the president of abuse of power: essentially, the Congress was \"invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of Order against a democratically elected government\" and \"subordinat[ing] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will\".<ref name=\"La respuesta del Presidente Allende\">{{in lang|es}} [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Manifiesto_al_pa%C3%ADs_de_Salvador_Allende,_respondiendo_al_acuerdo_de_la_camara_de_diputados La respuesta del Presidente Allende] on Wikisource.

In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' or a civil war with a declaration \"full of affirmations that had already been refuted before-hand\" and which, in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the President) violated a dozen articles of the Constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.\n\nPresident Allende wrote: \"Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it . . . With a tranquil conscience . . . I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside . . . I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences . . . Parliament has made itself a bastion against the transformations . . . and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives\".\n\nAdding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and that the Congress was obstructing said means\u2014having already \"paralyzed\" the State\u2014they sought to \"destroy\" it.

The first, non-military, approach involved attempting a constitutional coup. This was known as the [[United States intervention in Chile#Track I|Track I]] approach, in which the CIA, with the approval of the [[40 Committee]], attempted to bribe the Chilean legislature, tried to influence public opinion against Allende, and provided funding to strikes designed to coerce him into resigning. It also attempted to get congress to confirm [[Jorge Alessandri]] as the winner of the presidential election. Alessandri, who was an accessory to the conspiracy, was ready to then resign and call for fresh elections. This approach completely failed in 1970 and was not attempted again.\n\nThe other approach of the CIA in 1970 (but not later), also known as the [[United States intervention in Chile#Track II|Track II]] approach, was an attempt to encourage a military coup by creating a climate of crisis across the country.

The Province Prefect informed President Allende of the Navy's actions; immediately, the president went to the [[La Moneda|presidential palace]] with his bodyguards, the \"Group of Personal Friends\" (GAP). By 8:00&nbsp;am, the Army had closed most radio and television stations in Santiago city; the Air Force bombed the remaining active stations; the President received incomplete information, and was convinced that only a sector of the Navy conspired against him and his government.\n\nPresident Allende and Defence minister [[Orlando Letelier]] were unable to communicate with military leaders. Admiral Montero, the Navy's commander and an Allende loyalist, was rendered incommunicado; his telephone service was cut and his cars were sabotaged before the ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'', to ensure he could not thwart the opposition. Leadership of the Navy was transferred to [[Jos\u00e9 Toribio Merino]], planner of the ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' and executive officer to Adm. Montero. [[Augusto Pinochet]], General of the Army, and [[Gustavo Leigh]], General of the Air Force, did not answer Allende's telephone calls to them. The General Director of the ''Carabineros'' (uniformed police), [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sep\u00falveda]], and the head of the Investigations Police (plain clothes detectives), [[Alfredo Joignant]] answered Allende's calls and immediately went to the ''La Moneda'' presidential palace. When Defence minister Letelier arrived at the Ministry of Defense, controlled by Adm. [[Patricio Carvajal]], he was arrested as the first prisoner of the ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat''.\n\nDespite evidence that all branches of the Chilean armed forces were involved in the coup, Allende hoped that some units remained loyal to the government. Allende was convinced of Pinochet's loyalty, telling a reporter that the ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' leaders must have imprisoned the general. Only at 8:30&nbsp;am, when the armed forces declared their control of Chile and that Allende was deposed, did the president grasp the magnitude of the military's rebellion. Despite the lack of any military support, Allende refused to resign his office.\n\nAt approx. 9:00 the [[Carabineros de Chile|carabineros of the La Moneda]] left the building.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://diario.latercera.com/2013/09/07/01/contenido/reportajes/25-145786-9-el-balcon-del-adios.shtml\n|title=El balc\u00f3n del adi\u00f3s &#124; Reportajes\n|publisher=La Tercera Edici\u00f3n Impresa\n}}</ref>\nBy 9:00&nbsp;am, the armed forces controlled Chile, except for the city centre of the capital, Santiago.

The Socialist Party along with his Cuban advisors proposed to Allende that he escape to the San Joaqu\u00edn industrial zone in southern Santiago, to later re-group and lead a counter-''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat''; the president rejected the proposition.  According to Tanya Harmer, Allende's refusal to lead an insurgency against the coup is evidence of his unrelenting desire to bring about change through non-violent methods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Allende's Chile and the Inter-American Cold War|last=Harmer|first=Tanya|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8078-3495-4|editor-last=Odd Arne Westad|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|pages=11}}</ref> The military attempted negotiations with Allende, but the President refused to resign, citing his constitutional duty to remain in office.

Subsequently, most military officers remained under-funded, having only subsistence salaries. Because of the low salaries, the military spent much time in military leisure-time facilities (e.g. [[country club]]s) where they met other officers and their families. The military remained apart from society, and was to some degree an [[Endogamy|endogamous]] group as officers frequently married the sisters of their comrades or the daughters of high-ranked older officers. Many officers had also relatives in the military.<ref name=privada/> In 1969 elements of the military made their first act of rebellion in 40 years when they participated in the [[Tacnazo insurrection]].

[with] the goal of establishing a totalitarian system\", claiming it had made \"violations of the Constitution . . . a permanent system of conduct.\" Essentially, most of the accusations were about the government disregarding the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government. Finally, the resolution condemned the ''creation and development of government-protected armed groups, which . . . are headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces''. President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterised as ''notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks''.\n\nIt can be argued that the resolution called upon the armed forces to overthrow the government if it did not comply, as follows \"...To present the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces with the grave breakdown of the legal and constitutional order ... it is their duty to put an immediate end to all situations herein referred to that breach the Constitution and the laws of the land with the aim of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law.\"<ref>[[s:Agreement of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile|English translation]] on Wikisource</ref>\n\n===President Allende's response===\nTwo days later, on 24 August 1973, President Allende responded, characterising the Congress' declaration as \"destined to damage the country\u2019s prestige abroad and create internal confusion\", predicting \"It will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors\". He noted that the declaration had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority \"constitutionally required\" to convict the president of abuse of power: essentially, the Congress was \"invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of Order against a democratically elected government\" and \"subordinat[ing] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will\".<ref name=\"La respuesta del Presidente Allende\">{{in lang|es}} [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Manifiesto_al_pa%C3%ADs_de_Salvador_Allende,_respondiendo_al_acuerdo_de_la_camara_de_diputados La respuesta del Presidente Allende] on Wikisource.

In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' or a civil war with a declaration \"full of affirmations that had already been refuted before-hand\" and which, in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the President) violated a dozen articles of the Constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.\n\nPresident Allende wrote: \"Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it . . . With a tranquil conscience . . . I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside . . . I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences . . . Parliament has made itself a bastion against the transformations . . . and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives\".\n\nAdding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and that the Congress was obstructing said means\u2014having already \"paralyzed\" the State\u2014they sought to \"destroy\" it.

The first, non-military, approach involved attempting a constitutional coup. This was known as the [[United States intervention in Chile#Track I|Track I]] approach, in which the CIA, with the approval of the [[40 Committee]], attempted to bribe the Chilean legislature, tried to influence public opinion against Allende, and provided funding to strikes designed to coerce him into resigning. It also attempted to get congress to confirm [[Jorge Alessandri]] as the winner of the presidential election. Alessandri, who was an accessory to the conspiracy, was ready to then resign and call for fresh elections. This approach completely failed in 1970 and was not attempted again.\n\nThe other approach of the CIA in 1970 (but not later), also known as the [[United States intervention in Chile#Track II|Track II]] approach, was an attempt to encourage a military coup by creating a climate of crisis across the country. [[False flag]] operatives contacted senior Chilean military officers and informed them that the U.S. would actively support a coup, but would revoke all military aid if such a coup did not happen.<ref name=\"The Pinochet File\">{{cite book|last=Kornbluh|first=Peter|title=The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability|year=2003|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-56584-936-5}}</ref> In addition, the CIA gave extensive support for [[black propaganda]] against Allende, channeled mostly through ''[[El Mercurio]]''. Financial assistance was also given to Allende's political opponents, and for organizing strikes and unrest to destabilize the government. By 1970, the U.S. manufacturing company [[ITT Corporation]] owned 70% of [[Chitelco]] (the Chilean Telephone Company), and also funded ''El Mercurio''.

The Province Prefect informed President Allende of the Navy's actions; immediately, the president went to the [[La Moneda|presidential palace]] with his bodyguards, the \"Group of Personal Friends\" (GAP). By 8:00&nbsp;am, the Army had closed most radio and television stations in Santiago city; the Air Force bombed the remaining active stations; the President received incomplete information, and was convinced that only a sector of the Navy conspired against him and his government.\n\nPresident Allende and Defence minister [[Orlando Letelier]] were unable to communicate with military leaders. Admiral Montero, the Navy's commander and an Allende loyalist, was rendered incommunicado; his telephone service was cut and his cars were sabotaged before the ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'', to ensure he could not thwart the opposition. Leadership of the Navy was transferred to [[Jos\u00e9 Toribio Merino]], planner of the ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' and executive officer to Adm. Montero. [[Augusto Pinochet]], General of the Army, and [[Gustavo Leigh]], General of the Air Force, did not answer Allende's telephone calls to them. The General Director of the ''Carabineros'' (uniformed police), [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sep\u00falveda]], and the head of the Investigations Police (plain clothes detectives), [[Alfredo Joignant]] answered Allende's calls and immediately went to the ''La Moneda'' presidential palace. When Defence minister Letelier arrived at the Ministry of Defense, controlled by Adm. [[Patricio Carvajal]], he was arrested as the first prisoner of the ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat''.\n\nDespite evidence that all branches of the Chilean armed forces were involved in the coup, Allende hoped that some units remained loyal to the government. Allende was convinced of Pinochet's loyalty, telling a reporter that the ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' leaders must have imprisoned the general. Only at 8:30&nbsp;am, when the armed forces declared their control of Chile and that Allende was deposed, did the president grasp the magnitude of the military's rebellion. Despite the lack of any military support, Allende refused to resign his office.\n\nAt approx. 9:00 the [[Carabineros de Chile|carabineros of the La Moneda]] left the building.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://diario.latercera.com/2013/09/07/01/contenido/reportajes/25-145786-9-el-balcon-del-adios.shtml\n|title=El balc\u00f3n del adi\u00f3s &#124; Reportajes\n|publisher=La Tercera Edici\u00f3n Impresa\n}}</ref>\nBy 9:00&nbsp;am, the armed forces controlled Chile, except for the city centre of the capital, Santiago. Allende refused to surrender, despite the military's declaring they would bomb the ''La Moneda'' presidential palace if he resisted being deposed. The Socialist Party along with his Cuban advisors proposed to Allende that he escape to the San Joaqu\u00edn industrial zone in southern Santiago, to later re-group and lead a counter-''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat''; the president rejected the proposition.  According to Tanya Harmer, Allende's refusal to lead an insurgency against the coup is evidence of his unrelenting desire to bring about change through non-violent methods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Allende's Chile and the Inter-American Cold War|last=Harmer|first=Tanya|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8078-3495-4|editor-last=Odd Arne Westad|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA|pages=11}}</ref> The military attempted negotiations with Allende, but the President refused to resign, citing his constitutional duty to remain in office.

In some instances, the controversy extended to family members of these government officials, which had also been given early COVID-19 testing despite the algorithm.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Scarcity of laboratories and test kits ===\n{{further|Timeline of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Philippines}}\nThe Philippine government did not have the capacity to test for the [[SARS-CoV-2]] virus until January 30, 2020, when the government-run [[Research Institute for Tropical Medicine]] (RITM) was finally able to run confirmatory tests. Until that date, samples from suspected COVID-19 cases had to be sent to Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in [[Melbourne]], Australia for testing.<ref name=\"phacquires\">{{cite news |title=PH acquires confirmatory test kits for novel coronavirus |url=https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/1/29/Novel-coronavirus-confirmatory-test-kits-primers-RITM.html |publisher=CNN |date=January 29, 2020}}</ref> \n\nHowever, there were still very few testing kits in the Philippines, and the RITM was still the only laboratory that had the ability to process test results.

Studies of the archeological site's layers shows that volcanic ash formed a layer on the lake bed just below the layer that marks the appearance of occupation by a new village.<ref name=howe /> \n\nThe shallow water level of the marsh, the clay loam, and the basalt rubble basin extended all around and over this settlement point, meant that the Indian pioneers had to carry rocks to strengthen their foundation. After centuries of this procedure, they had built an island of an area approximately {{Convert|2.5|acre||abbr=}}. Surrounded by marshlands, the villagers could fish and hunt for waterfowl.<ref>Kittredge, W. (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=U89OpWh0itoC Balancing water: restoring the Klamath Basin]. Univ of California Press. Page 176</ref> The springs that are nearest to Nightfire Island are geothermal waters, adding to the comfort of the villagers. During the dry months, the receding water levels allowed for the establishment of a secure hunting station. Charcoal remains show evidence of cooking pits and cremated burial sites within the island. Bones show an early abundance of duck with additional diversity appearing in later years.<ref name=\"geoarch\" />\n \nFowl droppings on layers in the excavation site show that there were times where the site was abandoned for several hundred years, probably because of the rising of the levels of Indian Tom lake, climate change within the hot and dry middle Holocene, or changes in the Keno fault.<ref name=\"grayson\">Grayson, D.

The lower stratum is [[Lake|lacustrine]], waterway [[diatom]]-rich silt from the original lake floor present during the first occupation of the site. From there, the strata consist of a series of [[silt]], streamland and [[loam]] forming a [[duripan]] horizon.\n\nSamll animals hunted by the villagers were boiled in baskets, larger animals in rock roasting ovens primarily of large basalt rocks. Along with oven rocks, other rocks included broken fragments of [[mortar and pestle]]s and banded stones used for weights.
