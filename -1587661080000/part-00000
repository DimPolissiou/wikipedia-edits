He served in the [[Washington House of Representatives]] from 1989 to 1993. In 1992, Inslee was elected to represent {{ushr|WA|4}}, based around [[Central Washington]], in the U.S. House of Representatives. Defeated for reelection in [[1994 United States House of Representatives elections|1994]], Inslee briefly returned to private legal practice. He made his first run for governor of Washington in [[1996 Washington gubernatorial election|1996]], coming in fifth in the [[blanket primary]] ahead of the general election, which was won by Democrat [[Gary Locke]]. Inslee then served as regional director for the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] under President [[Bill Clinton]].\n\nInslee returned to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1999, this time for {{ushr|WA|1|}}. The new district included Seattle's northern suburbs in [[King County, Washington|King County]], [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish County]], and [[Kitsap County, Washington|Kitsap County]]. He was reelected six times before announcing that he would make another run for the governorship in the [[2012 Washington gubernatorial election|2012 election]]. He resigned from Congress to focus on his campaign. He defeated Republican [[Rob McKenna]], the [[List of Attorneys General of Washington|Attorney General of Washington]].

He has garnered national attention for his critiques of President [[Donald Trump]]. Inslee, State Attorney General [[Bob Ferguson (politician)|Bob Ferguson]] and State Solicitor General [[Noah Purcell]] sued the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump Administration]] over [[Executive Order 13769]], which halted travel for 90 days from seven Muslim-majority countries and imposed a total ban on Syrian refugees entering the United States. The case, ''[[Washington v. Trump]]'', led to the order being blocked by the courts, and other executive orders later superseded it.\n\nInslee [[Jay Inslee 2020 presidential campaign|was a candidate]] for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic nomination]] for President of the United States in the 2020 election, launching his campaign on March 1, 2019. He suspended his campaign on August 21, citing extremely low poll numbers. The next day, Inslee announced his intention to seek a third term as governor in [[2020 Washington gubernatorial election|the 2020 election]].and if he is re-elected it will mean the downfall of most of Washington state.

is an American lawyer and politician, who has served as the [[List of Governors of Washington|governor of Washington]] since 2013. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1993 to 1995 and from 1999 to 2012 and was a [[President of the United States|presidential]] candidate from March 1, 2019 to August 21, 2019 for [[2020 United States presidential election|the 2020 election]].\n\nBorn and raised in [[Seattle]], Inslee graduated from the [[University of Washington]] and [[Willamette University College of Law]]. He served in the [[Washington House of Representatives]] from 1989 to 1993. In 1992, Inslee was elected to represent {{ushr|WA|4}}, based around [[Central Washington]], in the U.S. House of Representatives. Defeated for reelection in [[1994 United States House of Representatives elections|1994]], Inslee briefly returned to private legal practice. He made his first run for governor of Washington in [[1996 Washington gubernatorial election|1996]], coming in fifth in the [[blanket primary]] ahead of the general election, which was won by Democrat [[Gary Locke]]. Inslee then served as regional director for the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] under President [[Bill Clinton]].\n\nInslee returned to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1999, this time for {{ushr|WA|1|}}. The new district included Seattle's northern suburbs in [[King County, Washington|King County]], [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish County]], and [[Kitsap County, Washington|Kitsap County]]. He was reelected six times before announcing that he would make another run for the governorship in the [[2012 Washington gubernatorial election|2012 election]]. He resigned from Congress to focus on his campaign. He defeated Republican [[Rob McKenna]], the [[List of Attorneys General of Washington|Attorney General of Washington]]. Inslee was reelected to a second term in [[2016 Washington gubernatorial election|2016]], defeating Republican [[Port of Seattle|Seattle Port Commissioner]] [[Bill Bryant (politician)|Bill Bryant]], 54% to 46%. Inslee served as chair of the [[Democratic Governors Association]] for the [[2018 United States gubernatorial elections|2018 election cycle]].\n\nAs governor, Inslee has emphasized [[climate change]], [[Education in the United States|education]] and [[drug policy reform]]. He has garnered national attention for his critiques of President [[Donald Trump]]. Inslee, State Attorney General [[Bob Ferguson (politician)|Bob Ferguson]] and State Solicitor General [[Noah Purcell]] sued the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump Administration]] over [[Executive Order 13769]], which halted travel for 90 days from seven Muslim-majority countries and imposed a total ban on Syrian refugees entering the United States. The case, ''[[Washington v. Trump]]'', led to the order being blocked by the courts, and other executive orders later superseded it.\n\nInslee [[Jay Inslee 2020 presidential campaign|was a candidate]] for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic nomination]] for President of the United States in the 2020 election, launching his campaign on March 1, 2019. He suspended his campaign on August 21, citing extremely low poll numbers. The next day, Inslee announced his intention to seek a third term as governor in [[2020 Washington gubernatorial election|the 2020 election]].and if he is re-elected it will mean the downfall of most of Washington state. He doesn't represent his state, he only rules it despite what his constituents desire or request.\n\n==Early life, education, and legal career==\nJay Robert Inslee was born February 9, 1951 in Seattle, Washington, the oldest of three sons of Adele A.

Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] before he was appointed [[Secretary of Defense]]. [[Robert Kennedy]] was uniquely considered to be a kitchen cabinet member as well as a Cabinet member while he was his brother's [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]].\n* [[Gerald Ford]] had a kitchen cabinet while [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]], which he continued to seek advice from after he assumed the presidency in August 1974.

The term has been used subsequently, especially under Tony Blair, for the sidelining of traditional democratic [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] structures to rely far more on a close group of non-elected advisors and allies. Examples of this practice include Blair's reliance on advisor [[Andrew Adonis]] before his appointment to the cabinet.
