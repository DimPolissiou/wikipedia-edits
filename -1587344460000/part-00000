Singh was an alumnus of Rashtriya Military School Bangalore (King George's Royal Indian Military College) and the [[National Defence Academy (India)|National Defence Academy]]. He was the first NDA alumnus and is the only [[UN Peacekeeper]] to be awarded a [[Param Vir Chakra]] (PVC), India's highest wartime military decoration.\n\nIn December 1961, Salaria was among the Indian troops deployed to the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] as part of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]]. On 5 December, Salaria's battalion was tasked to clear a roadblock of two armoured cars manned by 150 gendarmes of the secessionist [[State of Katanga]] on the way to the [[Elizabethville Airport]]. The plan was that Salaria and his men were to block their retreat. His [[rocket launcher]] team attacked and destroyed the Katangese armoured cars. This unforeseen move confused the [[gendarmerie]], and Salaria felt it would be best to attack before they reorganised. Though his troops were badly outnumbered, they charged towards the Katangese and killed 40 men in a [[kukri]] assault. During the attack, Salaria was shot twice in the neck and eventually succumbed to his injuries. The remaining gendarmes fled in utter confusion leaving their dead and wounded behind. This helped the main battalion to easily overrun the Katangese and clear the roadblock. For his duty and courage, and disregard for his own safety during the battle, Salaria was awarded the Param Vir Chakra.\n\n==Early life and education==\nGurbachan Singh Salaria was born on 29 November 1935, in Jamwal, a village near [[Shakargarh]], [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]], [[British Raj|British India]] (now in [[Pakistan]]). He was the second of five children of Munshi Ram and Dhan Devi.{{sfn|Rawat|2014|p=70}} His father had earlier been drafted into the Dogra Squadron of the [[Hodson's Horse]] in the [[British Indian Army]]. Listening to tales of his father and his regiment motivated Salaria to join the army at a very young age.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=187}}\n\nAs a result of the [[partition of India]], Salaria's family moved to the Indian part of Punjab and settled in Jangal village in [[Gurdaspur district]]. Salaria enrolled in the local village school.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=187}} He was not very attentive to his studies and spent much of his time playing [[kabaddi]].

Singh was an alumnus of Rashtriya Military School Bangalore (King George's Royal Indian Military College) and the [[National Defence Academy (India)|National Defence Academy]]. He was the first NDA alumnus and is the only [[UN Peacekeeper]] to be awarded a [[Param Vir Chakra]] (PVC), India's highest wartime military decoration.\n\nIn December 1961, Salaria was among the Indian troops deployed to the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] as part of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]]. On 5 December, Salaria's battalion was tasked to clear a roadblock of two armoured cars manned by 150 gendarmes of the secessionist [[State of Katanga]] on the way to the [[Elizabethville Airport]]. The plan was that Salaria and his men were to block their retreat. His [[rocket launcher]] team attacked and destroyed the Katangese armoured cars. This unforeseen move confused the [[gendarmerie]], and Salaria felt it would be best to attack before they reorganised. Though his troops were badly outnumbered, they charged towards the Katangese and killed 40 men in a [[kukri]] assault. During the attack, Salaria was shot twice in the neck and eventually succumbed to his injuries. The remaining gendarmes fled in utter confusion leaving their dead and wounded behind. This helped the main battalion to easily overrun the Katangese and clear the roadblock. For his duty and courage, and disregard for his own safety during the battle, Salaria was awarded the Param Vir Chakra.\n\n==Early life and education==\nGurbachan Singh Salaria was born on 29 November 1935, in Jamwal, a village near [[Shakargarh]], [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]], [[British Raj|British India]] (now in [[Pakistan]]). He was the second of five children of Munshi Ram and Dhan Devi.{{sfn|Rawat|2014|p=70}} His father had earlier been drafted into the Dogra Squadron of the [[Hodson's Horse]] in the [[British Indian Army]]. Listening to tales of his father and his regiment motivated Salaria to join the army at a very young age.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=187}}\n\nAs a result of the [[partition of India]], Salaria's family moved to the Indian part of Punjab and settled in Jangal village in [[Gurdaspur district]]. Salaria enrolled in the local village school.{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=187}} He was not very attentive to his studies and spent much of his time playing [[kabaddi]]. In July 1946 he applied for admission into the King George's Royal Indian Military College in Bangalore.

Salaria spent the following weeks excercising and when he applied again in August he met the requirements and was admitted into the college.<ref>{{cite news| title = He took them with a Khukri| newspaper = Tehelka| date = 18 August 2014| url = http://old.tehelka.com/he-took-them-with-a-khukri/| access-date = 19 April 2020}}</ref> In August 1947, he was transferred to the KGRIMC in [[Jalandhar]].{{Sfn|Cardozo|2003|p=187}} After passing out from KGRIMC, he joined the Joint Services Wing of the [[National Defence Academy (India)|National Defence Academy]] (NDA).

Clan Gunn is one of the oldest Scottish Clans, being descended from the Norse [[Earl of Orkney|Jarls of Orkney]] and the [[Picts|Pictish]] [[Mormaer of Caithness|Mormaers of Caithness]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\n====Traditional origins====\nThe traditional origin of the Clan Gunn is that the progenitor of the clan was one ''Gunni'' who came to [[Caithness]] at the end of the 12th century when his wife, Ragnhild, inherited the estates from her brother, [[Harald Maddadsson]] who was the [[Earl of Orkney]].<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\">Way, George and Squire, Romily. (1994). ''Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia''. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The [[Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs]]). pp. 399\u2013400.</ref> His wife descended from [[R\u00f6gnvald Kali Kolsson|St Ragnvald]], who was the founder of the [[St Magnus Cathedral]] in [[Kirkwall]], Orkney.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/> ''Gunni'', whose name meant ''war'', was allegedly descended from [[Viking]] adventurers and his grandfather was ''Sweyn'' who was killed in a raid on [[Dublin]] in 1171.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/> Smibert, however, states that the Gunns were of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] origin.<ref>Smibert, Thomas. (MDCCCL). (1850). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LScAAAAAQAAJ&q=Gunn#v=snippet&q=Gunn&f=false The Clans of the Highlands of Scotland, being an Account of their Annals, Separately & Collectively, with Delineations of their Tartans, and Family Arms]''. pp. 170\u2013171.</ref> Further information on the Norse origins of Clan Gunn can be found in an article written by Michael James Gunn, quoting [[Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert Gordon]]'s ''A Genealogical History of The Earldom of Sutherland'' from the 17th century: \"Sir Robert Gordon, in researching genealogies for his work interviewed many of the heads of families in Sutherland, among them Alexander Gun of Kilearnan and Navidale, 4th Mackeamish, who died in 1655. From him he learned that Mackeamish\u2019s family ''are called Clan-Gun from one called Gun, whom they allege to have been the king of Denmarke his sone, and came many dayes agoe from Denmark, and settled himself in Catteynes.'' The significance of this statement is made clear when it is remembered that, in Sir Robert Gordon\u2019s time, the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway were united under the Danish crown. However, the ancient Gaelic sennachies described the Gunns as Lochlainnach, or Norwegians, not Danes, because at the time of their forbear\u2019s arrival in Orkney and Caithness Norway was a separate kingdom and not united with Denmark until the Union of Kalmar in 1391.<ref>Gunn, Michael James.

He had married the daughter of [[John Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland]] and for this reason \"he felt entitled to hold his head high amongst the best in Scotland\". His pride, or perhaps his loyalty to the Earl of Sutherland, led to his undoing when in 1562, he led Gordon's retinue and encountered [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray]], and his followers on the High Street of Aberdeen. The Earl of Moray was the bastard half-brother of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], as well as the son-in-law of [[William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal]], chief of Clan Keith. It was the custom at the time to yield thoroughfares to the personage of greater rank, and in refusing to yield the middle of the street to Stewart and his train, Alistair publicly insulted the Earl. Stewart soon afterward had him pursued to a place called Delvines, near Nairn. There he was captured and taken to Inverness, and following a mock trial, he was executed.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/dtog/gunn2.html Clan Gunn history] electricscotland.com.

Clan Gunn is one of the oldest Scottish Clans, being descended from the Norse [[Earl of Orkney|Jarls of Orkney]] and the [[Picts|Pictish]] [[Mormaer of Caithness|Mormaers of Caithness]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\n====Traditional origins====\nThe traditional origin of the Clan Gunn is that the progenitor of the clan was one ''Gunni'' who came to [[Caithness]] at the end of the 12th century when his wife, Ragnhild, inherited the estates from her brother, [[Harald Maddadsson]] who was the [[Earl of Orkney]].<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\">Way, George and Squire, Romily. (1994). ''Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia''. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The [[Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs]]). pp. 399\u2013400.</ref> His wife descended from [[R\u00f6gnvald Kali Kolsson|St Ragnvald]], who was the founder of the [[St Magnus Cathedral]] in [[Kirkwall]], Orkney.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/> ''Gunni'', whose name meant ''war'', was allegedly descended from [[Viking]] adventurers and his grandfather was ''Sweyn'' who was killed in a raid on [[Dublin]] in 1171.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/> Smibert, however, states that the Gunns were of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] origin.<ref>Smibert, Thomas. (MDCCCL). (1850). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LScAAAAAQAAJ&q=Gunn#v=snippet&q=Gunn&f=false The Clans of the Highlands of Scotland, being an Account of their Annals, Separately & Collectively, with Delineations of their Tartans, and Family Arms]''. pp. 170\u2013171.</ref> Further information on the Norse origins of Clan Gunn can be found in an article written by Michael James Gunn, quoting [[Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert Gordon]]'s ''A Genealogical History of The Earldom of Sutherland'' from the 17th century: \"Sir Robert Gordon, in researching genealogies for his work interviewed many of the heads of families in Sutherland, among them Alexander Gun of Kilearnan and Navidale, 4th Mackeamish, who died in 1655. From him he learned that Mackeamish\u2019s family ''are called Clan-Gun from one called Gun, whom they allege to have been the king of Denmarke his sone, and came many dayes agoe from Denmark, and settled himself in Catteynes.'' The significance of this statement is made clear when it is remembered that, in Sir Robert Gordon\u2019s time, the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway were united under the Danish crown. However, the ancient Gaelic sennachies described the Gunns as Lochlainnach, or Norwegians, not Danes, because at the time of their forbear\u2019s arrival in Orkney and Caithness Norway was a separate kingdom and not united with Denmark until the Union of Kalmar in 1391.<ref>Gunn, Michael James. (2001). ''Olaf the Black and the Clan Gunn''</ref>\n\n====Recorded origins====\nThe first 'chief' of the Clan Gunn to appear in historical records definitively was George Gunn, who was the ''crouner'' or '' coroner'' of Caithness during the 15th century.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/> The later Celtic patronymic of the Gunn chiefs may have been ''MacSheumais Chataich'', however 'George' Gunn was widely known as ''Am Braisdeach Mor'' which means the ''great brooch-wearer''.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/> This was due to the insignia that was worn by him as coroner.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/> George is said to have held court at his Clyth Castle in such splendor that it would rival any Highland chief.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/>\n\n===15th century and clan conflicts===\n[[File:Gunn tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|thumb|right|200px|''Clanngvn'' [[tartan]], as published in 1842 in ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]''.]]\n\nThe [[Battle of Harpsdale]] was fought in 1426 where the Clan Gunn fought an inconclusive battle with the [[Clan Mackay]].<ref>[[Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet|Gordon, Sir Robert]] (1580\u20131656), ''A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland''. pp. 63\u201364.</ref>\n\nThe Gunn's traditional enemies were the [[Clan Keith]], who from their Ackergill Castle, challenged the Gunn chiefs for both political needs and for land.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/> In one such feud it was claimed that Dugald Keith coveted Helen, daughter of Gunn of Braemor.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/> The girl resisted Keith's advances but on learning that she was to be married to another man, he surrounded her father's house, slew many of the inhabitants and carried the girl to Ackergill Castle where she threw herself from the tower, rather than submitting to her kidnapper.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/> The Gunns retaliated and repeatedly raided the Keith's territory; however they suffered defeat in 1438 or 1464 at the [[Battle of Tannach]].<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/> Both sides having suffered considerable losses agreed to meet and settle their differences in what is known as the [[Battle of Champions]], where each side was to bring twelve horse.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/> However the Keiths arrived with two warriors on each horse and slaughtered the outnumbered Gunns.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/> This was in turn avenged by the chief's remaining son James who killed Keith of Ackergill and his son at Drummoy.<ref name=\"Clan.Encyclopedia.Gunn\"/>\n\n===16th century and clan conflicts===\n\nIn 1517 the Clan Gunn supported the [[Clan Sutherland]] in defeating the Clan Mackay at the [[Battle of Torran Dubh]].<ref>Sinclair, Thomas. (1890). ''The Gunns''. p. 36.</ref>\n\nAlistair Gunn, son of John Robson Gunn, had become a man of much note and power in the North. He had married the daughter of [[John Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland]] and for this reason \"he felt entitled to hold his head high amongst the best in Scotland\". His pride, or perhaps his loyalty to the Earl of Sutherland, led to his undoing when in 1562, he led Gordon's retinue and encountered [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray]], and his followers on the High Street of Aberdeen. The Earl of Moray was the bastard half-brother of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], as well as the son-in-law of [[William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal]], chief of Clan Keith. It was the custom at the time to yield thoroughfares to the personage of greater rank, and in refusing to yield the middle of the street to Stewart and his train, Alistair publicly insulted the Earl. Stewart soon afterward had him pursued to a place called Delvines, near Nairn. There he was captured and taken to Inverness, and following a mock trial, he was executed.<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/dtog/gunn2.html Clan Gunn history] electricscotland.com.

The conservation area spans three municipalities which include Liberty Borough, Lincoln Borough, and Elizabeth Township. The property is owned and managed by [[Allegheny Land Trust]] and is open year round to the public for educational and recreational purposes.\n\n== The Conservation Area ==\n\nDead Man's Hollow was established as a conservation area in 1996 and is considered to be the largest privately protected area in Allegheny County.\n\nSince the mid 1990s, volunteers from Allegheny Land Trust and other non-profit conservation groups based in the PIttsburgh region have made significant progress in removing trash and debris as well as invasive plant species from the property. This continued effort has allowed the area to return to a lush green wonderland beneath a canopy of native hardwoods.\n\nThe Dead Man's Hollow conservation area is also the home to a variety of Pennsylvania wildlife including twenty-four different species of birds.\n\nIn January 2017, the [[Pennsylvania's Department of Conservation]] and Natural Resources designated the area as a [[Wild Plant Sanctuary]].\n\n== Industrial History ==\n[[File:Dead Man's Hollow.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Boiler House \"ruins\" of the Union Sewer Pipe Company in Dead Man's Hollow.]]\n\nThe remnants of two industrial businesses that once thrived in the McKeesport area, the Bowman Brickyard and the Union Sewer Pipe Company, can also be found throughout the Dead Man's Hollow conservation area. Operations for both companies began in the late 1880s and lasted until a devastating fire brought it to an end in 1920.  A number of the established hiking trails give visitors the unique opportunity to <s>\"</s>step back in time<s>\"</s> while exploring the \"factory ruins\".  Among the most visited locations at the former industrial site are the large circular foundations of kiln ovens that were used in the pipe making process as well as the decaying graffiti covered walls of the company's boiler house. Other notable locations are the slightly curved wall of a former P&LE Railroad siding and an oversized drainage tunnel leading to the Youghiogheny River.\n\n== Haunted History ==\n\nAs the story goes, Dead Man's Hollow earned its dismal name in 1874 when a group of adolescent boys were roaming through the hollow and came upon a decomposed body that was hanging by a noose. The victim was never identified and no one was ever charged for the murder. Soon the natural isolation of the hollow became the setting for other dark tales of criminal acts and untimely deaths.  From suspicious drownings and violent gunfights to tragic explosions and lightning strikes, Dead Man's Hollow has been the scene of many grisly incidents and accidents.  Supposedly one or more of these bizarre tales have prompted quite a few encounters with the unknown in the secluded hollow.  Visitors to the site often return with unexplainable stories involving a shadowy presence, strange odors, and even the sound of voices when no one else was near.\n\n== Recreation ==\n\nWith over eight miles of hiking trails throughout Dead Man's Hollow, visitors can easily spend an entire day (or night) exploring the conservation area.  And with its close proximity to the Great Allegheny Passage recreational trail, Dead Man's Hollow has become a welcome place for cyclists to stop and relax for a few minutes.\n\nAccording to the Allegheny Land trust website, Open Hunting is permitted on this property as long as individuals apply for a free permit before hunting on any conservation area. It has also been suggested that anyone wishing to use the property for hunting purposes be familiar with the established trail system and avoid the areas where human interaction is likely.\n\n== Media History ==\n\nOver the years, the stories of Dead Man's Hollow have been featured in numerous articles printed in the McKeesport Daily News and the Pittsburgh Post Gazette.\n\nIn 2000, many of Dead Man's Hollow's tales made their debut in book format thanks to a former resident of Lincoln Borough named Karen Frank. With the help of the community, Frank compiled a number of old photographs and historical stories about the history of Dead Man's Hollow. No long after the book <u>Dead Man's Hollow : An Oral History and More</u> was released in limited quantity and quickly sold out.  Today, history enthusiasts have made this out-of-print publication is one of the most sought-after books in Southwestern Pennsylvania.\n\nDead Man's Hollow returned to the pages of another book in 2009 when History Press released <u>Legends & Lore of Western Pennsylvania</u>.  Written by folklore historian Thomas White, this particular book has been hailed by many as the best source of information on every ghostly legend that calls Dead Man's Hollow home.\n\nIn 2010, Dead Man's Hollow was launched into the 21st Century when it received its very own official website.  With an extensive timeline that chronicled the hollow's dark history, detailed trail maps, and plenty of photographs, www.dead-mans-hollow.com provided visitors with everything needed to explore Dead Man's Hollow in person or from an armchair.

The conservation area spans three municipalities which include Liberty Borough, Lincoln Borough, and Elizabeth Township. The property is owned and managed by [[Allegheny Land Trust]] and is open year round to the public for educational and recreational purposes.        \n\n== The Conservation Area ==\n\n\nDead Man's Hollow was established as a conservation area in 1996 and is considered to be the largest privately protected area in Allegheny County.\n\nSince the mid 1990s, volunteers from Allegheny Land Trust and other non-profit conservation groups based in the PIttsburgh region have made significant progress in removing trash and debris as well as invasive plant species from the property. This continued effort has allowed the area to return to a lush green wonderland beneath a canopy of native hardwoods.\n\nThe Dead Man's Hollow conservation area is also the home to a variety of Pennsylvania wildlife including twenty-four different species of birds.\n\nIn January of 2017, the [[Pennsylvania's Department of Conservation]] and Natural Resources designated the area as a [[Wild Plant Sanctuary]].\n\n<br />\n\n== Industrial History ==\n[[File:Dead Man's Hollow.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Boiler House \"ruins\" of the Union Sewer Pipe Company in Dead Man's Hollow.]]\n\n\nThe remnants of two industrial businesses that once thrived in the McKeesport area, the Bowman Brickyard and the Union Sewer Pipe Company, can also be found throughout the Dead Man's Hollow conservation area. Operations for both companies began in the late 1880s and lasted until a devastating fire brought it to an end in 1920.  A number of the established hiking trails give visitors the unique opportunity to <s>\"</s>step back in time<s>\"</s> while exploring the \"factory ruins\".  Among the most visited locations at the former industrial site are the large circular foundations of kiln ovens that were used in the pipe making process as well as the decaying graffiti covered walls of the company's boiler house. Other notable locations are the slightly curved wall of a former P&LE Railroad siding and an oversized drainage tunnel leading to the Youghiogheny River. \n\n== Haunted History ==\n\n\nAs the story goes, Dead Man's Hollow earned its dismal name in 1874 when a group of adolescent boys were roaming through the hollow and came upon a decomposed body that was hanging by a noose. The victim was never identified and no one was ever charged for the murder. Soon the natural isolation of the hollow became the setting for other dark tales of criminal acts and untimely deaths.  From suspicious drownings and violent gunfights to tragic explosions and lightning strikes, Dead Man's Hollow has been the scene of many grisly incidents and accidents.  Supposedly one or more of these bizarre tales have prompted quite a few encounters with the unknown in the secluded hollow.  Visitors to the site often return with unexplainable stories involving a shadowy presence, strange odors, and even the sound of voices when no one else was near.  \n<br />\n\n== Recreation ==\n\nWith over eight miles of hiking trails throughout Dead Man's Hollow, visitors can easily spend an entire day (or night) exploring the conservation area.  And with its close proximity to the Great Allegheny Passage recreational trail, Dead Man's Hollow has become a welcome place for cyclists to stop and relax for a few minutes.\n\nAccording to the Allegheny Land trust website, Open Hunting is permitted on this property as long as individuals apply for a free permit before hunting on any conservation area. It has also been suggested that anyone wishing to use the property for hunting purposes be familiar with the established trail system and avoid the areas where human interaction is likely.\n<br />\n\n== Media History ==\n\n\nOver the years, the stories of Dead Man's Hollow have been featured in numerous articles printed in the McKeesport Daily News and the Pittsburgh Post Gazette.\n\nIn 2000, many of Dead Man's Hollow's tales made their debut in book format thanks to a former resident of Lincoln Borough named Karen Frank. With the help of the community, Frank compiled a number of old photographs and historical stories about the history of Dead Man's Hollow. No long after the book <u>Dead Man's Hollow : An Oral History and More</u> was released in limited quantity and quickly sold out.  Today, history enthusiasts have made this out-of-print publication is one of the most sought-after books in Southwestern Pennsylvania.\n\nDead Man's Hollow returned to the pages of another book in 2009 when History Press released <u>Legends & Lore of Western Pennsylvania</u>.  Written by folklore historian Thomas White, this particular book has been hailed by many as the best source of information on every ghostly legend that calls Dead Man's Hollow home. \n\nIn 2010, Dead Man's Hollow was launched into the 21st Century when it received its very own official website.  With an extensive timeline that chronicled the hollow's dark history, detailed trail maps, and plenty of photographs, www.dead-mans-hollow.com provided visitors with everything needed to explore Dead Man's Hollow in person or from an armchair.

The property remained in a trust as a part of Smilie's estate until his last child died in 1851 when the property was sold.\n\nThe \"bottom land\" where Dawson is situated was acquired by John Smilie's granddaughter, Sarah Huston Dawson, and her second husband, George Dawson.\n\nThe Smilie farm, except the river bottom, was sold to Stewart Strickler. The bottom land was sold to George Dawson, who used it for purposes of cultivation. The Pittsburgh and Connellsville Railroad was located through the tract, and upon the opening of the line Dawson's Station was established at this point. A post office was established at the same time.\n\nThe property passed, in the division of the Dawson estate, to Mrs. Alfred [Elizabeth Dawson] Howell, and in 1866 a town plat was laid out and surveyed by Martin Dickson for Mr. Howell.<ref>Ellis, ''History of Fayette County, Pennsylvania'', p.800</ref>\n\nAlfred Howell caused the tract to be duly surveyed and laid out into building lots, and so conducted his enterprise as in the course of a few years to erect a prosperous and desirable village, with churches, public schools, etc., upon what was before, and but for his business foresight and energy would have remained, merely an uninhabitable portion of an old farm.<ref>Ellis, ''History of Fayette County, Pennsylvania'', p.352</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071027094918/http://www.fayetteportal.com/dawson/ Fayette County Portal]\n{{Pittsburgh Metro Area}}\n{{Fayette County, Pennsylvania}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1866]]\n[[Category:Pittsburgh metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:Boroughs in Fayette County, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:1866 establishments in Pennsylvania]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| name                   = Dawson, Pennsylvania\n| settlement_type        = [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|Borough]]\n| image_skyline          = James Cochran House Dawson 2011.jpg\n| image_alt              = \n| image_caption          = James Cochran House (1890)\n| image_flag             = \n| flag_alt               = \n| image_seal             = \n| seal_alt               = \n| image_shield           = \n| shield_alt             = \n| etymology              = \n| nickname               = \n| motto                  = \n| image_map              = File:Fayette County Pennsylvania Incorporated and Unincorporated areas Dawson Highlighted.svg\n| mapsize                = \n| map_alt                = \n| map_caption            = Location of Dawson in Fayette County, Pennsylvania.\n| pushpin_map            = Pennsylvania#USA\n| pushpin_label          = Dawson\n| pushpin_label_position = \n| pushpin_map_alt        = \n| pushpin_map_caption    = Location of Dawson in Pennsylvania\n| coordinates            = {{coord|40|2|52|N|79|31|31|W|display=inline,title}}\n| coor_pinpoint          = \n| coordinates_footnotes  = \n| subdivision_type       = Country\n| subdivision_name       = United States\n| subdivision_type1      = [[U.S. state|State]]\n| subdivision_name1      = [[Pennsylvania]]\n| subdivision_type2      = County\n| subdivision_name2      = [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette]]\n| established_title      = Established\n| established_date       = 1866\n| established_title1     = \n| established_date1      = \n| founder                = \n| seat_type              = \n| seat                   = \n| leader_party           = \n| leader_title           = Mayor\n| leader_name            = Sandy Newell\n| unit_pref              = Imperial\n| area_footnotes         = <ref name=\"CenPopGazetteer2016\">{{cite web|title=2017 U.S. Gazetteer Files|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2017_Gazetteer/2017_gaz_place_42.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=Mar 24, 2019}}</ref>\n| area_total_sq_mi       = 0.21\n| area_land_sq_mi        = 0.16\n| area_water_sq_mi       = 0.05\n| area_urban_sq_mi       = \n| area_rural_sq_mi       = \n| area_metro_sq_mi       = \n| area_water_percent     = \n| area_note              = \n| elevation_footnotes    = \n| elevation_ft           = \n| population_footnotes   = \n| population_total       = 367\n| population_as_of       = [[2010 United States Census|2010]]\n| population_density_sq_mi = 2192.55\n| population_demonym     = \n| population_note        = \n| timezone1              = [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n| utc_offset1            = -4\n| timezone1_DST          = [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]]\n| utc_offset1_DST        = -5\n| postal_code_type       = \n| postal_code            = \n| area_code_type         = \n| area_code              = [[Area code 724|724]]\n| blank_name_sec1        = \n| blank_info_sec1        = \n| website                = \n|pop_est_as_of = 2017\n|pop_est_footnotes = <ref name=\"USCensusEst2017\"/>\n|population_est = 353\n|blank_name = [[Federal Information Processing Standards|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info = 42-18360\n|area_total_km2 = 0.55\n|area_land_km2 = 0.42\n|area_water_km2 = 0.13\n|population_density_km2 = 844.57\n}}\n\n'''Dawson''' is a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Fayette County, Pennsylvania|Fayette County]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States.

The property remained in a trust as a part of Smilie's estate until his last child died in 1851 when the property was sold.\n\nThe \"bottom land\" where Dawson is situated was acquired by John Smilie's granddaughter, Sarah Huston Dawson, and her second husband, George Dawson.\n\nThe Smilie farm, except the river bottom, was sold to Stewart Strickler. The bottom land was sold to George Dawson, who used it for purposes of cultivation. The Pittsburgh and Connellsville Railroad was located through the tract, and upon the opening of the line Dawson's Station was established at this point. A post office was established at the same time.\n\nThe property passed, in the division of the Dawson estate, to Mrs. Alfred [Elizabeth Dawson] Howell, and in 1866 a town plat was laid out and surveyed by Martin Dickson for Mr. Howell.<ref>Ellis, ''History of Fayette County, Pennsylvania'', p.800</ref>\n\nAlfred Howell caused the tract to be duly surveyed and laid out into building lots, and so conducted his enterprise as in the course of a few years to erect a prosperous and desirable village, with churches, public schools, etc., upon what was before, and but for his business foresight and energy would have remained, merely an uninhabitable portion of an old farm.<ref>Ellis, ''History of Fayette County, Pennsylvania'', p.352</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071027094918/http://www.fayetteportal.com/dawson/ Fayette County Portal]\n{{Pittsburgh Metro Area}}\n{{Fayette County, Pennsylvania}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1866]]\n[[Category:Pittsburgh metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:Boroughs in Fayette County, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:1866 establishments in Pennsylvania]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson,_Pennsylvania"}
