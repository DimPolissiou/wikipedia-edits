Jagadesh Kumar of planning the attacks. It asked for his sacking and the initiation of a criminal inquiry against him. The report noted that despite SOS calls from the students, Kumar did not allow police to enter the campus till 7:45&nbsp;p.m. The report also demanded the investigation of other faculty members (who planned the attacks) and the security company hired to ensure safety on the campus.<ref name=\"Congress panel 12 Jan\" />\n\nA committee member called the attack a planned criminal conspiracy and stated that there was sufficient evidence that proved that the attackers were affiliated with right-wing groups.

After the attack, the police did not attempt to press attempted murder charges against the attackers even though the victims had received head injuries.

It stated that the Home Minister's remarks against the CAA-NRC protests and his calls for punishing them had encouraged the attackers.<ref name=\"Congress panel 12 Jan\" />\n\nAccording to the police report, the students had disconnected the internet servers on 3 January and again on 4 January.

The report questioned why the servers could not be made to work on 5 January, the day the attacks had happened, if the servers could be made functional earlier. The report asked if the administration already knew that an attack was going to happen and alleged that the servers were not made functional so that the closed-circuit cameras on the campus failed to record the attacks.<ref name=\"Congress panel 12 Jan\" />\n\nThe committee demanded the withdrawal of the fee hike and initiation of an independent judicial inquiry into the attacks.<ref name=\"Congress panel 12 Jan\" />\n\n==Investigation==\nPolice have said that some of the masked attackers have been identified and complaints have been merged and filed as a single FIR.<ref name=\"ndtv 24 students\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/jnu-violence-masked-mob-terrorises-jawaharlal-nehru-university-campus-24-students-and-teachers-injur-2159292|title=Some Masked JNU Attackers Identified, Say Cops, No Arrests Yet: 10 Points|last=Varma|first=Shylaja|date=6 December 2019|website=NDTV|access-date=6 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"FP JNUSU President\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/india/jnu-violence-live-updates-jnusu-president-aishe-ghosh-attacked-after-clash-with-abvp-members-students-claim-rss-abvp-men-called-outsiders-7863651.html|title=JNU violence LIVE updates: Sabarmati Hostel warden resigns on moral grounds; Delhi Police registers FIR 20 hours after attack on students|website=Firstpost|access-date=6 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> On 11 January, the police claimed they had identified 37 out of a total of 60 members of the WhatsApp group that included 10 outsiders, named 'Unity against Left'.

The FIR asked for action against those students, including JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh. Another FIR, alleged that the vandalism by students on 3 January severely affected the biometric attendance and [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit camera]] surveillance systems. In a statement, the JNU vice-chancellor had claimed that the violence on 5 January had its origins in the vandalism which occurred on 3 and 4 January. Response of two [[Right to Information Act, 2005|Right to Information (RTIs)]] unearthed information on the preceding incidents of the attack, specifically server room vandalism and raised further questions on vice-chancellor Kumar's claims and the FIRs by the JNU administration.<ref name=\"RTI1\">{{cite news |last1=Jebaraj |first1=Priscilla |title=JNU biometric systems, CCTVs not broken in Jan. 3, 4 vandalism' |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-biometric-systems-cctvs-not-broken-in-jan-3-4-vandalism/article30610681.ece |accessdate=28 January 2020 |work=The Hindu |date=21 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128033402/https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-biometric-systems-cctvs-not-broken-in-jan-3-4-vandalism/article30610681.ece |archive-date=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Bhatnagar |first1=Gaurav |title=RTI Reveals Glaring Loopholes in JNU Admin's Claims on Campus Violence |url=https://thewire.in/rights/rti-reveals-glaring-loopholes-in-jnu-admins-claims-on-campus-violence |accessdate=28 January 2020 |work=The Wire |date=6 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe RTIs asked for information on the number of biometric systems destroyed at CIS office, details of vandalised cameras as well as damaged cables used by the camera servers from 30 December 2019 to 8 January 2020.

Initially, police said that footage of the attack was not available and instead they were using screenshots from viral social media posts to identify the perpetrators. Contradicting the police claim, one of the RTI responses points to the footage being available. However, in response to another RTI, no continuous camera footage of the north gate cameras on 5 January, the day of the attack, was available with JNU.<ref name=\"RTI1\"/><ref name=\"RTI2\"/><ref name=\"RTI3\" /> There was also a mismatch in responses related to whether and when vandalism occurred or not.<ref name=\"RTI1\" />\n=== Court petitions ===\n==== Petition to preserve evidence ====\nOn 10 January 2020, three JNU professors filed a petition in the High Court seeking a direction to Delhi Police and the government to preserve data, closed-circuit camera footage footage, and all evidence associated with the attack.

The FIR asked for action against those students, including JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh. Another FIR, alleged that the vandalism by students on 3 January severely affected the biometric attendance and [[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit camera]] surveillance systems. In a statement, the JNU vice-chancellor had claimed that the violence on 5 January had its origins in the vandalism which occurred on 3 and 4 January. Response of two [[Right to Information Act, 2005|Right to Information (RTIs)]] unearthed information on the preceding incidents of the attack, specifically server room vandalism and raised further questions on vice-chancellor Kumar's claims and the FIRs by the JNU administration.<ref name=\"RTI1\">{{cite news |last1=Jebaraj |first1=Priscilla |title=JNU biometric systems, CCTVs not broken in Jan. 3, 4 vandalism' |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-biometric-systems-cctvs-not-broken-in-jan-3-4-vandalism/article30610681.ece |accessdate=28 January 2020 |work=The Hindu |date=21 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128033402/https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-biometric-systems-cctvs-not-broken-in-jan-3-4-vandalism/article30610681.ece |archive-date=28 January 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Bhatnagar |first1=Gaurav |title=RTI Reveals Glaring Loopholes in JNU Admin's Claims on Campus Violence |url=https://thewire.in/rights/rti-reveals-glaring-loopholes-in-jnu-admins-claims-on-campus-violence |accessdate=28 January 2020 |work=The Wire |date=6 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe RTIs asked for information on the number of biometric systems destroyed at CIS office, details of vandalised cameras as well as damaged cables used by the camera servers from 30 December 2019 to 8 January 2020.

Initially, police said that footage of the attack was not available and instead they were using screenshots from viral social media posts to identify the perpetrators. Contradicting the police claim, one of the RTI responses points to the footage being available. However, in response to another RTI, no continuous camera footage of the north gate cameras on 5 January, the day of the attack, was available with JNU.<ref name=\"RTI1\"/><ref name=\"RTI2\"/><ref name=\"RTI3\" /> There was also a mismatch in responses related to whether and when vandalism occurred or not.<ref name=\"RTI1\" />\n=== Court petitions ===\n==== Petition to preserve evidence ====\nOn 10 January 2020, three JNU professors filed a petition in the High Court seeking a direction to Delhi Police and the government to preserve data, closed-circuit camera footage footage, and all evidence associated with the attack.

Senegal also shares a maritime border with [[Cape Verde]]. Senegal's economic and political capital is [[Dakar]].\n\nIt is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential system|presidential republic]] and is the westernmost country in the mainland of the [[Old World]], or [[Afro-Eurasia]].<ref>Janet H.

Alternatively, the name could derive from the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] phrase \"Sunuu Gaal,\" which means \"our boat.\"\n\n== Cultures and influences ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}\nThe territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since [[prehistory]]. Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century, and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the [[Jolof Empire]]. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century, albeit amid much local resistance. Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960 and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa.\n\nSenegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, [[phosphate]] mining, fertilizer production, [[petroleum]] refining, construction materials, and ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including [[peanut]]s, [[sugarcane]], [[cotton]], [[green bean]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[melon]]s, and [[mango]]es.<ref name=fas/> Owing to its relative stability, tourism and hospitality are also burgeoning sectors.\n\nWith it being a multiethnic and secular nation, Senegal is predominantly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] with [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[traditional African religion|animist]] influences. French is the [[official language]], although many native languages are spoken and recognized. Since April 2012, Senegal's president has been [[Macky Sall]]. Senegal has been a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] since 1970.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Senegal}}\n\n===Early and pre-colonial eras===\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created around the 7th century: [[Takrur]] in the 9th century, {{ILL|Namandiru|wo}} and the [[Jolof Empire]] during the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern Senegal was once part of the [[Ghana Empire]].\n\nIslam was introduced through [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] and [[Soninke people|Soninke]] contact with the [[Almoravid dynasty]] of the [[Maghreb]], who in turn propagated it with the help of the Almoravids, and Toucouleur allies. This movement faced resistance from ethnicities of traditional religions, the Serers in particular.<ref>Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in Senegal: Sine-Saloum, 1847\u20131914'', p. 7, Edinburgh University Press (1968) {{ISBN|0-8047-0621-2}}</ref><ref>[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La civilisation Sereer, Pangool,'' p. 13. Dakar, Nouvelles Editions Africaines (1990), {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, the area came under the influence of the empires to the east; the Jolof Empire of Senegal was also founded during this time. In the Senegambia region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was [[Slavery in Africa|enslaved]], typically as a result of captives taken in warfare.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 \"Slavery\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Guide to Black History'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |date=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century the Jolof Empire grew more powerful, having united [[Cayor]] and the kingdoms of [[Baol]], [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]], [[Saloum]], [[Waalo]], [[Futa Tooro]] and [[Bambouk]], or much of present-day West Africa.

Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on 20 August, when Senegal and French Sudan (renamed the Republic of [[Mali]]) each proclaimed independence.\n\n[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]] was Senegal's first president in September 1960. Senghor was a very well-read man, educated in France. He was a poet and philosopher who personally drafted the Senegalese national anthem, \"Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons\". Pro-African, he advocated a brand of African socialism.<ref>''A Critical bibliography of French literature: in three parts. The Twentieth.'' Edited by David Clark Cabeen, Richard A.

Former prime minister [[Mamadou Dia]], who was Senghor's rival, ran for election in 1983 against Diouf, but lost. Senghor moved to France, where he died at the age of 96.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Boubacar Lam]] discovered Senegalese oral history that was initially compiled by the [[Toucouleur people|Tuculor]] noble, [[Yoro Dy\u00e2o]], not long after [[World War I]], which documented migrations into [[West Africa]] from the [[Nile Valley]]; ethnic groups, from the [[Senegal River]] to the [[Niger Delta]], retained traditions of having an eastern origin.<ref name=\"AfrAm\">{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Jane |title=A Companion to African-American Studies |date=15 April 2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=463 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODmpx1fgJNIC&pg=PA463|isbn=978-1-4051-5466-6}}</ref>\n\nSenegal joined with [[The Gambia]] to form the nominal [[Senegambia Confederation]] on 1 February 1982. However, the union was dissolved in 1989. Despite peace talks, a southern separatist group ([[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance]] or MFDC) in the [[Casamance]] region has clashed sporadically with government forces since 1982 in the [[Casamance conflict]]. In the early 21st century, violence has subsided and President [[Macky Sall]] held talks with rebels in Rome in December 2012.<ref>[http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=135&regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa# \"[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]: Senegal: Casamance, In-depth Developments since 2005\"], ''Conflict Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nAbdou Diouf was president between 1981 and 2000. He encouraged broader political participation, reduced government involvement in the economy, and widened Senegal's diplomatic engagements, particularly with other developing nations. Domestic politics on occasion spilled over into street violence, border tensions, and a violent separatist movement in the southern region of the Casamance. Nevertheless, Senegal's commitment to democracy and human rights strengthened. Abdou Diouf served four terms as president.\n\nIn the presidential election of 1999, opposition leader [[Abdoulaye Wade]] defeated Diouf in an election deemed free and fair by international observers. Senegal experienced its second peaceful transition of power and its first from one political party to another. On 30 December 2004 President Wade announced that he would sign a peace treaty with the separatist group in the Casamance region. This, however, has yet to be implemented. There was a round of talks in 2005, but the results have not yet yielded a resolution.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of Senegal}}\n[[File:Macky Sall - 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Macky Sall]], President of Senegal (2012\u2013present)]]\n[[File:Abdoulaye Wade in 16-05-2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abdoulaye Wade]], President of Senegal (2000\u20132012)]]\n\nSenegal is a [[republic]] with a presidency; the president is [[Elections in Senegal|elected]] every five years as of 2016, previously being seven years from independence to 2001, five years from 2001 to 2008, and 7 years again from 2008 to 2016,  by adult voters.

Local administrators are appointed and held accountable by the president. [[Marabout]]s, religious leaders of the various [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal]], have also exercised a strong political influence in the country especially during Wade's presidency. In 2009, [[Freedom House]] downgraded Senegal's status from \"Free\" to \"Partially Free\", based on increased centralisation of power in the executive.

Friendly to the West, especially to France and to the [[United States]], Senegal also is a vigorous proponent of more assistance from developed countries to the [[Third World]].\n\nSenegal enjoys mostly cordial relations with its neighbors. In spite of clear progress on other fronts with [[Mauritania]] (border security, resource management, economic integration, etc.), an estimated 35,000 Mauritanian refugees (of the estimated 40,000 who were expelled from their home country in 1989) remain in Senegal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2014/05/mauritanian-refugees-refuse-leave-senegal-20145872721336117.html|title=Mauritanian refugees refuse to leave Senegal|date=8 May 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera}}</ref>\n\nSenegal is part of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS).

The Senegalese military force receives most of its training, equipment, and support from France and the United States. Germany also provides support but on a smaller scale.\n\nMilitary noninterference in political affairs has contributed to Senegal's stability since independence. Senegal has participated in many international and regional peacekeeping missions. Most recently, in 2000, Senegal sent a battalion to the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] to participate in [[MONUC]], the [[United Nations]] peacekeeping mission, and agreed to deploy a United States-trained battalion to [[Sierra Leone]] to participate in [[UNAMSIL]], another UN peacekeeping mission.\n\nIn 2015, Senegal participated in the Saudi Arabian-led [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|military intervention in Yemen]] against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Houthis]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Senegal to send 2,100 troops to join Saudi-led alliance|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/04/us-yemen-saudi-senegal-idUSKBN0NP1N920150504|date=4 May 2015|agency=Reuters}}</ref>\n\n===Law===\nSenegal is a secular state, as defined in its [[Constitution of Senegal|Constitution]].<ref name=\"Constitution of Senegal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/sn/sn014en.pdf|title=Constitution of Senegal (Article 1)|accessdate=4 August 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930153624/http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/sn/sn014en.pdf|archivedate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo fight corruption, the government has created the National Anti-Corruption Office (OFNAC) and the Commission of Restitution and Recovery of Illegally Acquired Assets.

By the 19th century, French powers also strengthened their roots in Senegal and thus the number of French-speaking people multiplied continuously. French was ratified as the official language of Senegal in 1960 when the country achieved independence.\n\nAround 15 to 20% of men and 2% of women speak and understand French.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} In addition, 21% of the population is partially fluent in the French language.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nMost people also speak their own ethnic language while, especially in Dakar, [[Wolof language|Wolof]] is the [[lingua franca]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wolof|author=National African Language Research Center|publisher=University of Wisconsin |location=Madison}}</ref> [[Pulaar]] is spoken by the Fulas and Toucouleur.

Many of the ''Toucouleurs'', or sedentary Halpulaar of the Senegal River Valley in the north, converted to Islam around a millennium ago and later contributed to Islam's propagation throughout Senegal.

In Murid communities, which place more emphasis on the work ethic than on literary Quranic studies, the term ''daara'' often applies to work groups devoted to working for a religious leader. Other Islamic groups include the much older Q\u0101diriyya order and the Senegalese [[Layene|Laayeen]] order, which is prominent among the coastal Lebu. Today, most Senegalese children study at ''daara''s for several years, memorizing as much of the Qur'an as they can. Some of them continue their religious studies at councils (''majlis'') or at the growing number of private Arabic schools and publicly funded Franco-Arabic schools.\n\nSmall Roman Catholic communities are mainly found in coastal Serer, [[Jola people|Jola]], [[Mankanya people|Mankanya]] and Balant populations, and in eastern Senegal among the Bassari and Coniagui. The Protestant churches are mainly attended by immigrants but during the second half of the 20th century Protestant churches led by Senegalese leaders from different ethnic groups have evolved. In Dakar Catholic and Protestant rites are practiced by the Lebanese, Cape Verdean, European, and American immigrant populations, and among certain Africans of other countries as well as by the Senegalese themselves.

Senegal also shares a maritime border with [[Cape Verde]]. Senegal's economic and political capital is [[Dakar]].\n\nIt is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential system|presidential republic]] and is the westernmost country in the mainland of the [[Old World]], or [[Afro-Eurasia]].<ref>Janet H.

Alternatively, the name could derive from the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] phrase \"Sunuu Gaal,\" which means \"our boat.\"\n\n== Cultures and influences ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}\nThe territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since [[prehistory]]. Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century, and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the [[Jolof Empire]]. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century, when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century, albeit amid much local resistance. Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960, and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa.\n\nSenegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, [[phosphate]] mining, fertilizer production, [[petroleum]] refining, construction materials, and ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including [[peanut]]s, [[sugarcane]], [[cotton]], [[green bean]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[melon]]s, and [[mango]]es.<ref name=fas/> Owing to its relative stability, tourism and hospitality are also burgeoning sectors.\n\nWith it being a multiethnic and secular nation, Senegal is predominantly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] with [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[traditional African religion|animist]] influences. French is the [[official language]], although many native languages are spoken and recognized. Since April 2012, Senegal's president has been [[Macky Sall]]. Senegal has been a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] since 1970.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Senegal}}\n\n===Early and pre-colonial eras===\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created around the 7th century: [[Takrur]] in the 9th century, {{ILL|Namandiru|wo}} and the [[Jolof Empire]] during the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern Senegal was once part of the [[Ghana Empire]].\n\nIslam was introduced through [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] and [[Soninke people|Soninke]] contact with the [[Almoravid dynasty]] of the [[Maghreb]], who in turn propagated it with the help of the Almoravids, and Toucouleur allies. This movement faced resistance from ethnicities of traditional religions, the Serers in particular.<ref>Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in Senegal: Sine-Saloum, 1847\u20131914'', p. 7, Edinburgh University Press (1968) {{ISBN|0-8047-0621-2}}</ref><ref>[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La civilisation Sereer, Pangool,'' p. 13. Dakar, Nouvelles Editions Africaines (1990), {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, the area came under the influence of the empires to the east; the Jolof Empire of Senegal was also founded during this time. In the Senegambia region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was [[Slavery in Africa|enslaved]], typically as a result of captives taken in warfare.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 \"Slavery\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Guide to Black History'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |date=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century the Jolof Empire grew more powerful, having united [[Cayor]] and the kingdoms of [[Baol]], [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]], [[Saloum]], [[Waalo]], [[Futa Tooro]] and [[Bambouk]], or much of present-day West Africa.

French and British diplomacy in the area were thrown into disarray.\n\n===Independence (1960)===\nOn 4 April 1959 Senegal and the [[French Sudan]] merged to form the [[Mali Federation]], which became fully independent on 20 June 1960, as a result of a transfer of power agreement signed with France on 4 April 1960. Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on 20 August, when Senegal and French Sudan (renamed the Republic of [[Mali]]) each proclaimed independence.\n\n[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]] was Senegal's first president in September 1960. Senghor was a very well-read man, educated in France. He was a poet and philosopher who personally drafted the Senegalese national anthem, \"Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons\". Pro-African, he advocated a brand of African socialism.<ref>''A Critical bibliography of French literature: in three parts. The Twentieth.'' Edited by David Clark Cabeen, Richard A.

Former prime minister [[Mamadou Dia]], who was Senghor's rival, ran for election in 1983 against Diouf, but lost. Senghor moved to France, where he died at the age of 96.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Boubacar Lam]] discovered Senegalese oral history that was initially compiled by the [[Toucouleur people|Tuculor]] noble, [[Yoro Dy\u00e2o]], not long after [[World War I]], which documented migrations into [[West Africa]] from the [[Nile Valley]]; ethnic groups, from the [[Senegal River]] to the [[Niger Delta]], retained traditions of having an eastern origin.<ref name=\"AfrAm\">{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Jane |title=A Companion to African-American Studies |date=15 April 2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=463 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODmpx1fgJNIC&pg=PA463|isbn=978-1-4051-5466-6}}</ref>\n\nSenegal joined with [[The Gambia]] to form the nominal [[Senegambia Confederation]] on 1 February 1982. However, the union was dissolved in 1989. Despite peace talks, a southern separatist group ([[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance]] or MFDC) in the [[Casamance]] region has clashed sporadically with government forces since 1982 in the [[Casamance conflict]]. In the early 21st century, violence has subsided and President [[Macky Sall]] held talks with rebels in Rome in December 2012.<ref>[http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=135&regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa# \"[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]: Senegal: Casamance, In-depth Developments since 2005\"], ''Conflict Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nAbdou Diouf was president between 1981 and 2000. He encouraged broader political participation, reduced government involvement in the economy, and widened Senegal's diplomatic engagements, particularly with other developing nations. Domestic politics on occasion spilled over into street violence, border tensions, and a violent separatist movement in the southern region of the Casamance. Nevertheless, Senegal's commitment to democracy and human rights strengthened. Abdou Diouf served four terms as president.\n\nIn the presidential election of 1999, opposition leader [[Abdoulaye Wade]] defeated Diouf in an election deemed free and fair by international observers. Senegal experienced its second peaceful transition of power, and its first from one political party to another. On 30 December 2004 President Wade announced that he would sign a peace treaty with the separatist group in the Casamance region. This, however, has yet to be implemented. There was a round of talks in 2005, but the results have not yet yielded a resolution.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of Senegal}}\n[[File:Macky Sall - 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Macky Sall]], President of Senegal (2012\u2013present)]]\n[[File:Abdoulaye Wade in 16-05-2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abdoulaye Wade]], President of Senegal (2000\u20132012)]]\n\nSenegal is a [[republic]] with a presidency; the president is [[Elections in Senegal|elected]] every five years as of 2016, previously being seven years from independence to 2001, five years from 2001 to 2008, and 7 years again from 2008 to 2016,  by adult voters.

Local administrators are appointed and held accountable by the president. [[Marabout]]s, religious leaders of the various [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal]], have also exercised a strong political influence in the country especially during Wade's presidency. In 2009, [[Freedom House]] downgraded Senegal's status from \"Free\" to \"Partially Free\", based on increased centralisation of power in the executive.

Friendly to the West, especially to France and to the [[United States]], Senegal also is a vigorous proponent of more assistance from developed countries to the [[Third World]].\n\nSenegal enjoys mostly cordial relations with its neighbors. In spite of clear progress on other fronts with [[Mauritania]] (border security, resource management, economic integration, etc.), an estimated 35,000 Mauritanian refugees (of the estimated 40,000 who were expelled from their home country in 1989) remain in Senegal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2014/05/mauritanian-refugees-refuse-leave-senegal-20145872721336117.html|title=Mauritanian refugees refuse to leave Senegal|date=8 May 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera}}</ref>\n\nSenegal is part of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS).

The Senegalese military force receives most of its training, equipment, and support from France and the United States. Germany also provides support but on a smaller scale.\n\nMilitary noninterference in political affairs has contributed to Senegal's stability since independence. Senegal has participated in many international and regional peacekeeping missions. Most recently, in 2000, Senegal sent a battalion to the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] to participate in [[MONUC]], the [[United Nations]] peacekeeping mission, and agreed to deploy a United States-trained battalion to [[Sierra Leone]] to participate in [[UNAMSIL]], another UN peacekeeping mission.\n\nIn 2015, Senegal participated in the Saudi Arabian-led [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|military intervention in Yemen]] against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Houthis]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Senegal to send 2,100 troops to join Saudi-led alliance|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/04/us-yemen-saudi-senegal-idUSKBN0NP1N920150504|date=4 May 2015|agency=Reuters}}</ref>\n\n===Law===\nSenegal is a secular state, as defined in its [[Constitution of Senegal|Constitution]].<ref name=\"Constitution of Senegal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/sn/sn014en.pdf|title=Constitution of Senegal (Article 1)|accessdate=4 August 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930153624/http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/sn/sn014en.pdf|archivedate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo fight corruption, the government has created the National Anti-Corruption Office (OFNAC) and the Commission of Restitution and Recovery of Illegally Acquired Assets.

Many of the ''Toucouleurs'', or sedentary Halpulaar of the Senegal River Valley in the north, converted to Islam around a millennium ago and later contributed to Islam's propagation throughout Senegal.

In Murid communities, which place more emphasis on the work ethic than on literary Quranic studies, the term ''daara'' often applies to work groups devoted to working for a religious leader. Other Islamic groups include the much older Q\u0101diriyya order and the Senegalese [[Layene|Laayeen]] order, which is prominent among the coastal Lebu. Today, most Senegalese children study at ''daara''s for several years, memorizing as much of the Qur'an as they can. Some of them continue their religious studies at councils (''majlis'') or at the growing number of private Arabic schools and publicly funded Franco-Arabic schools.\n\nSmall Roman Catholic communities are mainly found in coastal Serer, [[Jola people|Jola]], [[Mankanya people|Mankanya]] and Balant populations, and in eastern Senegal among the Bassari and Coniagui. The Protestant churches are mainly attended by immigrants but during the second half of the 20th century Protestant churches led by Senegalese leaders from different ethnic groups have evolved. In Dakar Catholic and Protestant rites are practiced by the Lebanese, Cape Verdean, European, and American immigrant populations, and among certain Africans of other countries as well as by the Senegalese themselves.

They are often served with fresh fruit and are traditionally followed by [[coffee]] or [[tea]].\n\n===Music===\n{{Further|Music of Senegal}}\n[[File:Solo cissokho DSC 0448.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Kora (instrument)|Kora]] player from Senegal]]\nSenegal is known across Africa for its musical heritage, due to the popularity of [[mbalax]], which originated from the Serer [[percussion instrument|percussive]] tradition especially the [[Njuup]], it has been popularized by [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Omar Pene]] and others. [[Sabar]] drumming is especially popular. The sabar is mostly used in special celebrations like weddings. Another instrument, the [[Talking drum|tama]], is used in more ethnic groups.

Leading export [[coffee]] (US$340&nbsp;million) accounted for 22% of total Honduran export revenues. Bananas, formerly the country's second-largest export until being virtually wiped out by 1998's [[Hurricane Mitch]], recovered in 2000 to 57% of pre-Mitch levels. [[shrimp|Cultivated shrimp]] is another important export sector. Since the late 1970s, towns in the north began industrial production through [[maquiladora]]s, especially in [[San Pedro Sula]] and [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]].\n\nHonduras has extensive forests, marine, and mineral [[Resource (economics)|resources]], although widespread [[slash and burn]] agricultural methods continue to destroy Honduran forests. The Honduran economy grew 4.8% in 2000, recovering from the Mitch-induced recession (\u22121.9%) of 1999. The Honduran [[maquiladora]] sector, the third-largest in the world, continued its strong performance in 2000, providing employment to over 120,000 and generating more than $528&nbsp; million in foreign exchange for the country. [[Inflation]], as measured by the [[consumer price index]], was 10.1% in 2000, down slightly from the 10.9% recorded in 1999. The country's international reserve position continued to be strong in 2000, at slightly over US$1 billion. Remittances from Hondurans living abroad (mostly in the US) rose 28% to $410&nbsp; million in 2000. The Lempira (currency) was [[devaluation|devaluing]] for many years but stabilized at L19 to the US dollar in 2005. The Honduran people are among the poorest in [[Latin America]]; [[gross national income]] per capita (2007) is US$1,649; the average for Central America is $6,736.<ref>[http://data.un.org United Nations data], National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates, Per capita GNI at current prices \u2013 US dollars.</ref>\nHonduras is the fourth poorest country in the [[Western Hemisphere]]; only [[Haiti]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Guyana]] are poorer. Using [[Gross domestic product#Limitations of GDP to judge the health of an economy|alternative]] statistical measurements in addition to the gross domestic product can provide greater context for the nation's poverty.\n\nThe country signed an [[Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility]] (ESAF) \u2013 later converted to a [[Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility]] (PRGF) with the [[International Monetary Fund]] in March 1999. Honduras (as of the about year 2000) continues to maintain stable [[macroeconomic policies]]. It not been swift to implementing structural changes such as privatization of the publicly owned telephone and energy distribution companies\u2014changes which are desired by the IMF and other international lenders. Honduras received significant debt relief in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Mitch]], including the suspension bilateral debt service payments and bilateral debt reduction by the [[Paris Club]]\u2014including the US \u2013 worth over $400&nbsp; million. In July 2000, Honduras reached its decision point under the [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] Initiative (HIPC), qualifying the country for interim multilateral debt relief.\n\nLand appears to be plentiful and readily exploitable, but the presence of apparently extensive land is misleading because the nation's rugged, mountainous terrain restricts large-scale agricultural production to narrow strips on the coasts and to a few fertile valleys. Honduras's manufacturing sector has not yet developed beyond simple textile and agricultural processing industries and assembly operations. The small domestic market and competition from more industrially advanced countries in the region have inhibited more complex [[industrialization]].\n\n==Economic history==\n[[File:Honduras econ 1983.jpg|thumb|550px|An economic activity map of Honduras, 1983.]]\n{{Underlinked|section|date=September 2018}}\nAfter Honduras achieved independence from [[Spain]] in the early 19th century, its economic growth became closely related to its ability to develop attractive export products. During much of the 19th century, the Honduran economy languished; traditional cattle raising and subsistence agriculture produced no suitable major export. In the latter part of the century, economic activity quickened with the development of large-scale, precious metal mining. The most important mines were in the mountains near the capital of Tegucigalpa and were owned by the [[Rosario Mining Company|New York and Honduras Rosario Mining Company]] (NYHRMC).\n\n[[Silver]] was the principal metal extracted, accounting for about 55% of exports in the 1880s. [[Mining]] income stimulated commercial and ancillary enterprises, built infrastructure, and reduced monetary restraints on trade. There were few other beneficial economic effects, however, because the [[mining industry]] was never well integrated into the rest of the [[Economy of Honduras|Honduran economy]]. The foreign mining companies employed a small [[workforce]], provided little or no government revenue, and relied mostly on imported mining equipment.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nHonduras's international economic activity surged in the early 20th century. Between 1913 and 1929, its agricultural exports rose from $3&nbsp;million ($2&nbsp;million from bananas) to $25&nbsp;million ($21&nbsp;million from bananas). These \"golden\" exports were supported by more than $40&nbsp;million of specialized banana company investment in the Honduran infrastructure and were safeguarded by US pressure on the national government when the companies felt threatened.\n\nThe overall performance of the Honduran economy remained closely tied to [[banana]] prices and production from the 1920s until after the mid-century because other forms of commercial export agriculture were slow to emerge. In addition, until drastically reduced in the mid-1950s, the workforce associated with banana cultivation represented a significant proportion of the wage earners in the country. Just before the banana industry's largest strike in 1954, approximately 35,000 workers held jobs on the banana plantations of the [[United Fruit Company]] (later United Brands Company, then Chiquita Brands International) or the [[Standard Fruit Company]] (later brought by Castle and Cook, then [[Dole Food Company]]).\n\nAfter 1950 Honduran governments encouraged agricultural modernization and export diversification by spending heavily on transportation and communications infrastructure, agricultural credit, and technical assistance. During the 1950s\u2014as a result of these improvements and the strong international export prices\u2014[[beef]], [[cotton]], and [[coffee]] became significant export products for the first time. Honduran [[sugar]], [[Lumber|timber]], and [[tobacco]] also were exported, and by 1960 bananas had declined to a more modest share (45 percent) of total exports. During the 1960s, industrial growth was stimulated by the establishment of the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM\u2014see Appendix B).\n\nAs a result of the reduction of regional [[trade barriers]] and the construction of a high [[common external tariff]], some Honduran manufactured products, such as soaps, sold successfully in other Central American countries. Because of the greater size and relative efficiency of the Salvadoran and Guatemalan industrial sectors, however, Honduras bought far more manufactured products from its neighbors than it sold to them. After the 1969 [[Soccer War]] with [[El Salvador]], Honduras effectively withdrew from the CACM. Favorable bilateral trade arrangements between Honduras and the other former CACM partners were subsequently negotiated, however.\n\n[[File:SanPedroSula.jpg|thumb|300px|Downtown [[San Pedro Sula]].]]\nA political shift in the 1980s had strong and unexpected repercussions on the country's economic condition. Beginning in late 1979, as insurgency spread in neighboring countries, Honduran military leaders enthusiastically came to support [[United States]] policies in the region. This alignment resulted in financial support that benefited the civilian as well as the military ministries and agencies of Honduras. Honduran defense spending rose throughout the 1980s until it consumed 20 to 30 percent of the national budget. Before the military buildup began in fiscal year (FY) 1980, United States military assistance to Honduras was less than US$4&nbsp;million. Military aid more than doubled to reach just under US$9&nbsp;million by FY 1981, surged to more than $31&nbsp;million by FY 1982, and stood at $48.3&nbsp;million in FY 1983. Tiny Honduras soon became the tenth largest recipient of United States assistance aid; total economic and military aid rose to more than $200&nbsp;million in 1985 and remained at more than $100&nbsp;million for the rest of the 1980s.\n\nThe increasing dependence of the Honduran economy on foreign aid was aggravated by a severe, regionwide economic decline during the 1980s. Private investment plummeted in 1980, and [[capital flight]] for that year was $500&nbsp;million. To make matters worse, coffee prices plunged on the international market in the mid-1980s and remained low throughout the decade. In 1993 average annual per capita income remained depressingly low at about $580, and 75 percent of the population was poor by internationally defined standards.\n\nTraditionally, Honduran economic hopes have been pinned on land and agricultural commodities. Despite those hopes, however, usable land has always been severely limited. Honduras's mostly mountainous terrain confines agriculturally exploitable land to narrow bands along the coasts and to some previously fertile but now largely depleted valleys. The country's once abundant forest resources have also been dramatically reduced, and Honduras has not derived economically significant income from mineral resources since the 19th century. Similarly, Honduras's industrial sector never was fully developed. The heady days of the CACM (mid to -late 1960s), which produced an industrial boom for El Salvador and Guatemala, barely touched the Honduran economy except to increase its imports because of the comparative advantages enjoyed by the Salvadoran and Guatemalan economies and Honduras's inability to compete.\n\nBananas and coffee have also proven unreliable sources of income. Although bananas are less subject to the vagaries of international markets than coffee, natural disasters such as [[Hurricane Fifi\u2013Orlene|Hurricane Fifi]] in 1974, drought, and disease have appeared with a regular, albeit random, frequency to take their economic toll through severely diminished [[harvests]]. Moreover, bananas are grown and marketed mostly by international corporations, which keep the bulk of wealth generated. Coffee exports, equally unreliable as a major source of economic support, surpassed bananas in the mid1970s as Honduras's leading export income earner, but international price declines coupled with huge fiscal deficits underlined the vulnerability of coffee as an economic base.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n{{Missing information|section|[[Effects of Hurricane Mitch in Honduras|the devastating effects of Hurricane Mitch on this nation]]. Didn't it cause a [[recession]] here in 1998?|date=September 2018}}\nAs Honduras entered the 1990s, it did have some factors working in its favor\u2014relative peace and a stronger civilian government with less military interference in the politics and economy of the country than in past years. The country was hobbled, however, by horrendous foreign debt, could claim only diminished natural resources, and had one of the fastest-growing and urbanizing populations in the world. The government's daunting task then became how to create an economic base able to compensate for the withdrawal of much United States assistance without becoming solely dependent on traditional agricultural exports.\n\nIn the 1990s, bananas were booming again, particularly as new European trade agreements increased market size. Small banana producing cooperatives lined up in the 1990s to sell their land to the commercial giants, and the last banana-producing lands held by the government were privatized. Like most of Central America, Honduras in the 1990s began to woo foreign investors, mostly Asian clothing assembly firms, and it held high hopes for revenue to be generated by privatizing national industries. With one of the most strike-prone labor forces in Central America, debt-burdened and aging industrial assets, and a dramatically underdeveloped infrastructure, Honduras, however, has distinct economic disadvantages relative to its Central American and Caribbean neighbors, who compete with Honduras in the same export markets.\n\nHonduran president [[Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero]], elected in November 1989, enjoyed little success in the early part of his administration as he attempted to adhere to a standard economic austerity package prescribed by the [[International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund (IMF)]] and the [[World Bank]]. As the November 1993 presidential elections drew closer, the political fallout of austere economic measures made their implementation even less likely. Any hope for his party's winning the 1993 election was predicated on improving social programs, addressing employment needs, and appeasing a disgruntled, vocal public sector. However, reaching those goals required policies that moved away from balancing the budget, lowering [[inflation]], and reducing the deficit and external debt to attract investment and stimulate economic growth.\n\nCallejas inherited an economic mess. The economy had deteriorated rapidly, starting in 1989, as the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (AID) pointedly interrupted disbursements of its grants to Honduras to signal displeasure with the economic policies of the old government and to push the new government to make economic reforms. Nondisbursal of those funds greatly exacerbated the country's economic problems. Funds from the multilateral lending institutions, which eventually would help fill the gap left by the reduction of United States aid, were still under negotiation in 1989 and would be conditioned first on payment of arrears on the country's enormous external debt.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1985, the government of Honduras\u2014pumped up by massive infusions of external borrowing\u2014had introduced expensive, high-tech infrastructure projects. The construction of roads and dams, financed mostly by multilateral loans and grants, was intended to generate employment to compensate for the impact of the regionwide recession. In reality, the development projects served to swell the ranks of public-sector employment and line the pockets of a small elite. The projects never sparked private-sector investment or created substantial private employment. Instead, per capita income continued to fall as Honduras's external debt doubled. Even greater injections of foreign assistance between 1985 and 1988 kept the economy afloat, but it soon became clear that the successive governments had been borrowing time as well as money.\n\nForeign aid between 1985 and 1989 represented about 4.6 percent of the [[gross domestic product (GDP)]]. About 44 percent of the government's fiscal shortfall was financed through cash from foreign sources. Side effects of the cash infusion were that the national currency, the lempira became overvalued and the number of exports dropped. A booming public sector, with its enhanced ability to import, was enough to keep the economy showing growth, based on private consumption and government spending. But the government did little to address the historical, underlying structural problems of the economy\u2014its overdependence on too few traditional commodities and lack of investment. Unemployment mushroomed, and private investment withered.\n\nBy 1989 president Callejas's broad economic goal became to return Honduran economic growth to 1960\u201380 levels. During the decades of the 1960s and 1970s, the country's economy, spurred mostly by erratically fluctuating traditional agricultural commodities, nevertheless averaged real annual growth of between 4 and 5 percent. At the end of the 1980s, however, Callejas had few remaining vehicles with which to pull the country out of the deep regionwide recession of the 1980s. Real growth between 1989 and 1993 translated to mostly negative or small positive per capita changes in the GDP for a population that was growing at close to 4 percent annually.\n\nPresident Callejas attempted to adhere to conditions of desperately needed new loans. Cutting the size of the public sector workforce, lowering the deficit, and enhancing revenues from taxes\u2014as mandated by the multilateral lending institutions\u2014were consistently his biggest stumbling blocks. Despite his all-out effort to reduce the public-sector deficit, the overall ratio of fiscal deficit to the GDP in 1990 showed little change from that in 1989. The total public-sector deficit actually grew to 8.6 percent of the GDP, or nearly L1&nbsp;billion, in 1991.\n\nThe 1993 deficit expanded to 10.6 percent of GDP. The Honduran government's medium-term economic objectives, as dictated by the IMF, were to have generated real GDP growth of 3.5 percent by 1992 and 4 percent by 1993. In fact, GDP growth was 3.3 percent in 1991, 5.6 percent in 1992, and an estimated 3.7 percent in 1993. The economy had operated so long on an ad hoc basis that it lacked the tools to implement coherent economic objectives. Solving the most immediate crisis frequently took precedence over long-term goals.\nInflation\n\nBy 1991 President Callejas had achieved modest success in controlling inflation. Overall inflation for 1990 had reached 36.4 percent\u2014not the hyperinflation experienced by some Latin American counties\u2014but still the highest annual rate for Honduras in forty years. The Honduran government and the IMF had set an inflation target of 12 percent for 1992 and 8 percent for 1993. The actual figures were 8.8 percent in 1992 and an estimated 10.7 percent for 1993. Hondurans had been accustomed to low inflation (3.4 percent in 1985, rising to 4.5 percent by the end of 1986), partly because pegging the lempira to the dollar-linked Honduras's inflation rate to inflation rates in developed countries. But the expectation for low inflation made the reality of high inflation that much worse and created additional pressures on the government for action when inflation soared in 1990.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://countrystudies.us/honduras/62.htm | title=Growth and Structure of the Economy | publisher=countrystudies.us | accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Unemployment==\n\nBetween 1980 and 1983, 20 percent of the workforce was unemployed\u2014double the percentage of the late 1970s. Job creation remained substantially behind the growth of the labor force throughout the 1980s. Unemployment grew to 25 percent by 1985, and combined unemployment and underemployment jumped to 40 percent in 1989. By 1993, 50 to 60 percent of the Honduran labor force was estimated to be either underemployed or unemployed.\n\nThe government's acceptance of foreign aid during the 1980s, in lieu of economic growth sparked by private investment, allowed it to ignore the necessity of creating new jobs. Honduras's GDP showed reasonable growth throughout most of the 1980s, especially when compared to the rest of Latin America, but it was artificially buoyed by private consumption and public-sector spending.\n\nMainstay agricultural jobs became scarcer in the late 1970s. Coffee harvests and plantings in border area decreased because fighting in neighboring Nicaragua and El Salvador spilled over into Honduras. Other factors contributing to the job scarcity were limited land, a reluctance on the part of coffee growers to invest while wars destabilized the region, and a lack of credit. Small farmers became increasingly unable to support themselves as their parcels of land diminished in size and productivity.\n\nProblems in the agricultural sector have fueled urbanization. The Honduran population was 77 percent rural in 1960. By 1992 only 55 percent of the Honduran population continued to live in rural areas. [[Peasant]]s (campesinos) flocked to the cities in search of work but found little there. Overall unemployment has been exacerbated by an influx of refugees from the wars in neighboring countries, attracted to Honduras, ironically, by its relatively low population density and relative peace. In the agricultural sector (which in 1993 still accounted for about 60 percent of the labor force), unemployment has been estimated to be far worse than the figures for the total labor force.\n\nHonduran urban employment in the early 1990s has been characterized by underemployment and marginal informal-sector jobs, as thousands of former agricultural workers and refugees have moved to the cities seeking better lives. Few new jobs have been generated in the formal sector, however, because the domestic private sector and foreign investments have dropped and coveted public-sector jobs have been reserved mostly for the small Honduran middle-class with political or military connections. Only one of ten Honduran workers were securely employed in the formal sector in 1991.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the World Bank reported that only 10,000 new jobs were created annually; the low rate of job creation resulted in 20,000 people being added to the ranks of the unemployed every year. The actual disparity between jobs needed for full employment and new jobs created exceeded that projection, however. For those with jobs, the buying power of their wages tumbled throughout the 1980s while the cost of basic goods, especially food, climbed precipitously.\n\n==Role of government==\n\nThroughout the 1960s and most of the 1970s, the military-led governments of Honduras ran a state-sponsored and state-financed economy. The governments provided most guarantees for loans to a strong but patronage-dominated and somewhat corrupt public sector that included recipients of graft extracted from foreign and domestic investors, and to costly state-developed enterprises. By 1989 and the election of president Callejas, however, a heavy toll had been taken by regionwide economic recession, civil war in neighboring countries, the drying up of most external credit, and capital flight equaling more than $1.5&nbsp;billion.\n\nCallejas began to shift economic policy toward privatizing government-owned enterprises, liberalizing trade and tariff regulations, and encouraging increased foreign investment through tax and other incentives. The Callejas administration did not seek less government control. Rather it changed the government's objectives by focusing on reducing public-sector spending, the size of the public-sector workforce, and the trade deficit. Overall economic planning became the responsibility of the National Superior Planning Council, directed by the minister of economy and commerce. President Callejas, a US-trained economist, brought new professionalism and technical skills to the central government as he began the arduous task of long-term economic reform.\n\nThe official exchange rate of the lempira, pegged at US$1=L2 since 1918, was dramatically devalued in 1990. Exchange controls had been introduced in 1982, resulting in a parallel currency market (black market) and several confusing official exchange rates operating simultaneously. Some of those rates were legally recognized in 1990 when President Callejas introduced a major series of economic policy reforms, which included reducing the maximum import tariff rate from 90 percent to 40 percent and getting rid of most surcharges and exemptions.\n\nThe value of the lempira was adjusted to US$1=L4, with the exception of the rate for debt equity conversions, which remained at the old rate of US$1=L2. The official conversion rate of the lempira fell to US$1=L7.26 in December 1993. The president also introduced temporary taxes on exports, which were intended to increase central government revenue. Additional price and trade liberalization measures and fewer government regulations became part of his ongoing reforms.\nBudget\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the Honduran government was heavily financed by foreign assistance. External financing\u2014mostly bilateral credit from the United States\u2014rose dramatically until it reached 87 percent of the public deficit in 1985, rising even further in subsequent years. By 1991 the public-sector deficit was entirely financed with net external credit. That financing permitted the government to reduce the demand for internal credit and, therefore, to maintain its established exchange rate.\n\nIn 1991 Callejas managed to give the appearance of having reduced the overall fiscal deficit, a requirement for new credit. But the deficit decrease was mostly an accounting device because it resulted from the postponement of external payments to the Paris Club debtors and eventually would be offset by pressure to raise public investment. During 1991, loan negotiations with multilateral and bilateral lending institutions brought Honduras $39.5&nbsp;million in United States development assistance, $70&nbsp;million in balance-of-payments assistance in the form of cash grants, and $18.8&nbsp;million in food aid.\n\nHonduras country also negotiated $302.4&nbsp;million in concessional loans from the multilateral lending institutions. Total outstanding external debt as a percentage of GDP fell from 119 percent in 1990 to 114 percent in 1991 and to 112 percent in 1993. This drop was largely the result of debt forgiveness of $448.4&nbsp;million by the United States, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Scheduled amortization payments of an average $223.2&nbsp;million per year, however, guaranteed that Honduras's gross funding requirements would remain large indefinitely.\n\nThe government of Honduras projected that overall tax revenues would increase from 13.2 percent of GDP in 1989 to about 15.7 percent in 1991. Adjustments for low coffee prices and the continuation of lax collection methods, however, undermined those goals. Despite these tax increases, compared to developed countries, Honduras has low tax rates with, particularly low property taxes.\n\n==Labor force==\n\nHonduras suffers from an overabundance of unskilled and uneducated laborers. Most Honduran workers in 1993 continued to be employed in agriculture, which accounted for about 60 percent of the labor force. More than half of the rural population, moreover, remains landless and heavily dependent on diminishing seasonal labor and low wages. Fifty-five percent of the farming population subsists on less than two [[hectares]] and earns less than $70 per capita per year from those plots, mostly by growing subsistence food crops.\n\nIn 1993 only about 9\u201313 percent of the Honduran labor force was engaged in the country's tiny manufacturing sector\u2014one of the smallest in Central America. Skilled laborers are scarce. Only 25,000 people per year, of which about 21 percent are industrial workers, graduate yearly from the National Institute of Professional Training (Instituto Nacional de Formaci\u00f3n Profesional- -INFOP) established in 1972.\n\nHundreds of small manufacturing firms, the traditional backbone of Honduran enterprise, began to go out of business beginning in the early 1990s, as import costs rose and competition through increasing wages for skilled labor from the mostly Asian-owned assembly industries strengthened. The small Honduran shops, most of which had manufactured clothing or food products for the domestic market, traditionally received little support in the form of credit from the government or the private sector and were more like artisans than conventional manufacturers. Asian-owned export assembly firms (maquiladoras), operating mostly in free zones established by the government on the Caribbean coast, attract thousands of job seekers and swell the populations of new city centers such as San Pedro Sula, [[Tela]], and [[La Ceiba]]. Those firms employ approximately 16,000 workers in 1991.\n\nAbout one-third of the Honduran labor force was estimated to be working in the service or \"other\" sector in 1993. That classification usually means that a person ekes out a precarious livelihood in the urban informal sector or as a poorly paid domestic. As unemployment soared throughout Central America in the 1980s, more and more people were forced to rely on their own ingenuity in order to simply exist on the fringes of Honduran society.\n\nAs for the informal sector, research has shown that evidence of [[child labor]] has been observed mostly in the Honduran agricultural sector.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/honduras.htm |title=Honduras 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor |access-date=18 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328232751/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/honduras.htm |archive-date=28 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2014, the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' cites three goods produced in such working conditions in Honduras; namely [[Coffee production in Honduras|coffee]], lobsters and melons.\n\n===Employment indicators and benefits===\n\nHonduran governments have set minimum wages since 1974, but enforcement has generally been lax. That laxity increased at the beginning of the 1980s. Traditionally, most Honduran workers have not been covered by social security, welfare, or minimum wages. Multinational companies usually paid more than the standard minimum wage, but, overall, the Honduran wage earner has experienced a diminution of real wages and purchasing ability for more than a decade. When they occurred, minimum wage adjustments generally did not keep up with the cost of living increases.\n\nAfter a major currency devaluation in 1990, average Honduran workers were among the most poorly paid workers in the Western Hemisphere. By contrast, the banana companies paid relatively high wages as early as the 1970s. Banana workers continued at the top of the wage scale in the 1990s; however, in the 1980s, as banana production became less labor-intensive, the companies had decreased their investment and workforce. Consequently, fewer workers were employed as relatively well-paid agricultural wage earners with related benefits.\n\nPresident Callejas responded to the severe poverty by implementing a specially financed Honduran Social Investment Fund (Fondo Hondure\u00f1o de Inversi\u00f3n Social\u2014FHIS) in 1990. The fund created public works programs such as road maintenance and provided United States surplus food to mothers and infants. Many Hondurans slipped through that fragile [[social safety net]]. As a continuing part of the social pact, and even more as the result of a fierce union-government battle, President Callejas announced in 1991 a 27.8 percent increase over a minimum wage that the government had earlier agreed upon. That increase was in addition to raises of 50 and 22 percent set, respectively, in January and September 1990. Despite those concessions, the minimum daily rate in 1991 was only $1.75 for workers employed by small agricultural enterprises and $3.15 for workers in the big exporting concerns; most workers did not earn the minimum wage.\n\n===Labor unions===\n\nHonduras has long been heavily unionized. In 1993 approximately 15 to 20 percent of the overall formal workforce was represented by some type of union, and about 40 percent of urban workers were union members. There were forty-eight strikes in the public sector alone in 1990, protesting the government's economic austerity program and layoffs of public-sector workers. More than 4,000 public-sector employees from the Ministry of Communications, Public Works, and Transport were fired in 1990. About 70,000 unionized workers remained in the faltering public sector at the beginning of 1991. However, the government largely made good its pledge to trim that number by 8,000 to 10,000 throughout 1991 as part of its austerity program.\n\nIn the private sector, 1990 saw 94 strikes in 64 firms, as workers fought for wage increases to combat inflation. A forty-two-day strike at the Tela Railroad Company (owned by [[Chiquita Brands International]]\u2014formerly United Brands and United Fruit Company) was unsuccessful, however, and that defeat temporarily ended union efforts at direct confrontation.\n\nIn 1993 Honduras had three major labor confederations: the [[Confederation of Honduran Workers]] (Confederaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores de Honduras\u2014CTH), claiming a membership of about 160,000 workers; the [[General Workers Central]] (Central General de Trabajadores\u2014CGT), claiming to represent 120,000 members; and the Unitary Confederation of Honduran Workers ([[Confederaci\u00f3n Unitaria de Trabajadores de Honduras]]\u2014CUTH), a new confederation formed in May 1992, with an estimated membership of about 30,000. The three confederations included numerous trade union federations, individual unions, and peasant organizations.\n\nThe CTH, the nation's largest trade confederation, was formed in 1964 by the nation's largest peasant organization, the National Association of Honduran Peasants (Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Campesinos de Honduras\u2014Anach), and by Honduran unions affiliated with the [[Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers]] (Organizaci\u00f3n Regional Interamericana de Trabajadores\u2014ORIT), a hemispheric labor organization with close ties to the [[American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (AFL-CIO).\n\nIn the early 1990s, the confederation had three major components: the 45,000-member Federation of Unions of National Workers of Honduras (Federaci\u00f3n Sindical de Trabajadores Nacionales de Honduras\u2014Fesitranh); the 22,000 member Central Federation of Honduran Free Trade Unions (Federaci\u00f3n Central de Sindicatos Libres de Honduras); and the 2,200-member Federation of National Maritime Unions of Honduras (Federaci\u00f3n de Sindicales Mar\u00edtimas Nacionales de Honduras). In addition, Anach, claiming to represent between 60,000 and 80,000 members, was affiliated with Fesitranh.\n\nFesitranh was by far the country's most powerful labor federation, with most of its unions located in San Pedro Sula and the Puerto Cort\u00e9s Free Zone. The unions of the United States-owned banana companies and the United States-owned petroleum refinery also were affiliated with Fesitranh. The CTH received support from foreign labor organizations, including [[ORIT]], the [[American Institute for Free Labor Development]] (AIFLD), and Germany's [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]] and was an affiliate of the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (ICFTU).\n\nAlthough it was not legally recognized until 1982, the CGT was originally formed in 1970 by the [[Christian Democratic Party of Honduras|Christian Democrats]] and received external support from the [[World Confederation of Labour]] (WCL) and the Latin American Workers Central (Central Latinoamericana de Trabajadores\u2014CLAT), a regional organization supported by Christian Democratic parties. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, the CGT leadership developed close ties to the [[National Party of Honduras]] (Partido Nacional de Honduaras\u2014PNH), and several leaders served in the Callejas government. Another national peasant organization, the National Union of Peasants (Uni\u00f3n Nacional de Campesinos\u2014UNC), claiming a membership of 40,000, was affiliated with the CGT for many years and was a principal force within the confederation.\n\nThe CUTH was formed in May 1992 by two principal labor federations, the Unitary Federation of Honduran Workers ([[Federaci\u00f3n Unitaria de Trabajadores de Honduras]]\u2014FUTH) and the Independent Federation of Honduran Workers (Federaci\u00f3n Independiente de Trabajadores de Honduras\u2014FITH), as well as several smaller labor groups, all critical of the Callejas government's neoliberal economic reform program.\n\nThe Marxist [[FUTH]], with an estimated 16,000 members in the early 1990s, was first organized in 1980 by three communist-influenced unions, but did not receive legal status until 1988. The federation had external ties with the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] (WFTU), the Permanent Congress for Latin American Workers Trade Union Unity (Congreso Permanente de Unidad Sindical de Trabajadores de Am\u00e9rica Latina\u2014CPUSTAL), and the Central American Committee of Trade Union Unity (Comit\u00e9 de Unidad Sindical de Centroam\u00e9rica\u2014CUSCA). Its affiliations included water utility, university, electricity company, brewery, and teacher unions, as well as several peasant organizations, including the National Central of Farm Workers (Central Nacional de Trabajadores del Campo\u2014CNTC), formed in 1985 and active in land occupations in the early 1980s.\n\nFUTH also became affiliated with a number of leftist popular organizations in a group known as the Coordinating Committee of Popular Organizations (Comit\u00e9 Coordinadora de las Organizaciones Populares\u2014CCOP) that was formed in 1984. Dissident FUTH member formed the FITH, which was granted legal status in 1988. The FITH consisted of fourteen unions claiming about 13,000 members in the early 1990s.\n\n==Agriculture and land use==\n[[File:Colbanana04.jpg|thumb|175px|Bananas are one of Honduras' main exports.]]\n\nThe total land area of Honduras is 11.2&nbsp;million hectares, of which a scant 1.7&nbsp;million hectares (about 15 percent) are well suited for agriculture. Most land in Honduras is covered by mountains, giving rise to the country's nickname, \"the Tibet of Central America.\" Nevertheless, the Honduran economy has always depended almost exclusively on agriculture, and in 1992 agriculture was still the largest sector of the economy, contributing 28 percent to the GDP.\n\nLess than half of Honduras's cultivable land was planted with [[crops]] as recently as the mid-1980s. The rest was used for pastures or was forested and was owned by the government or the banana corporations. Potential for additional productivity from fallow land was questionable, however, because much of Honduras's soil lacks the thick volcanic ash found elsewhere in Central America. By 1987 about 750,000 hectares of Honduran land had been seriously eroded as a result of misuse by cattle ranchers and slash-and-burn squatters who planted unsuitable food crops.\n\nThe Honduran government and two banana companies\u2014Chiquita Brands International and Dole Food Company\u2014owned approximately 60 percent of Honduras's cultivable land in 1993. The banana companies acquired most of their landholdings in the early 20th century in return for building the railroads used to transport bananas from the interior to the coast. Much of their land remained unused because it lacked irrigation. Only about 14 percent of cultivated land was irrigated in 1987. Most land under cultivation in 1992 was planted in bananas, coffee, and specialized export crops such as melons and winter vegetables.\n\n===Agricultural policy===\n\nThe agricultural sector's output showed little or no growth between 1970 and 1985. As a result of favorable weather and market conditions beginning in 1995, however, the agricultural sector grew at a rate of 2.6 percent annually, slightly above the average for Latin America during that period. Production of basic grains and coffee increased; the export price of bananas was high; and pork, poultry, and milk produced for the domestic market increased. Nontraditional fruits and vegetables also increased in value.\n\nHonduran agricultural production overall has tended to be low because the amount of crop yielded by a given amount of land has been low. For example, Honduran chocolate yields historically have been only about half those of Costa Rica. Instead of using improved techniques to increase the productivity of the land, Honduran farmers have merely expanded the hectarage under cultivation to produce more crops\u2014pushing their fields ever farther into the forests. Given the limited amount of good quality agricultural land, to begin with, that policy has resulted in continual deforestation and subsequent erosion. This reluctance to improve techniques, coupled with generally poor soil, a lack of credit, and poor infrastructure, has contributed to low production figures.\n\n===Land reform===\n\nThe Honduran government nominally began to address inequitable land ownership in the early 1960s. Those efforts at reform focused on organizing rural cooperatives. About 1,500 hectares of government-owned land were distributed by the National Agrarian Institute (Instituto Nacional Agrario\u2014INA) beginning in 1960.\n\nA [[1963 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup in 1963]] resulted in an end to the land reform program. Lacking even modest government-directed land reforms, illegal [[squatting]] became the primary means for poor people to gain land throughout the early 1970s. These actions spurred the government to institute new agrarian reforms in 1972 and 1975. Although all lands planted in export crops were exempted from reform, about 120,000 hectares were, nevertheless, divided among 35,000 poor families.\n\nBy 1975 the pendulum had swung back, and agrarian reform was all but halted. From 1975 through the 1980s, illegal occupations of unused land increased once again. The need for land reform was addressed mostly by laws directed at granting titles to squatters and other landholders, permitting them to sell their land or to use it as collateral for loans.\n\nDespite declarations by the Callejas government in 1989 of its intent to increasingly address social issues, including land tenure and other needs of small farmers, the early 1990s were jolted by increased conflicts between peasants and the Honduran security forces. Agricultural credit and government support increasingly favored export crop producers at the expense of producers of basic food crops.\n\nThe Honduran land reform process under President Callejas between 1989 and 1992 was directed primarily at large agricultural landowners. An agrarian pact, signed by landowners and peasant organizations in August 1990, remained underfunded and largely unimplemented. Furthermore, violence erupted as discharged members of the Honduran military forcibly tried to claim land that had already been awarded to the peasant organization Anach in 1976.\n\nIn May 1991, violence initiated by members of the Honduran military resulted in the deaths of eight farmers. To keep similar situations around the country from escalating into violence, the government promised to parcel out land belonging to the National Corporation for Investment (Corporaci\u00f3n Nacional de Inversiones\u2014Conadin). The government also pledged to return to peasants land that had been confiscated by the Honduran military in 1983.\n\nAn Agricultural Modernization Law, passed in 1992, accelerated [[land titling]] and altered the structure of land cooperatives formed in the 1960s. The law permitted cooperative members to break up their holdings into small personal plots that could be sold. As a result, some small banana producers suffering from economic hard times chose to sell their land to the giant banana producers. After an agreement was reached with the European Union (EU) to increase Honduras's banana quota to the EU, the large banana companies were avid for additional land for increased production to meet the anticipated new demand from Europe.\n\n===Traditional crops===\n\nThroughout the 20th century, Honduras's agriculture has been dominated first by bananas and then to a lesser extent by coffee and sugar. In 1992, bananas and coffee together accounted for 50 percent of the value of Honduran exports and made the biggest contribution to the economy. Total banana sales were $287&nbsp;million and total coffee sales amounted to $148&nbsp;million. These figures are impressive yet reflect production losses suffered by banana producers and the withholding of coffee exports from the market in an effort to fight steep price declines.\n\nAnother major blow to Honduran agriculture came from Hurricane Mitch and its aftermath in 1998 and 1999. As of 2012 both industries are on the upswing. The banana industry is dominated by [[Chiquita]] and the [[Dole Food Company]], two multinational corporations. The coffee industry, in contrast, offers better opportunities for small Honduran family farms to compete. Sugar has also been an important Honduran crop.\n\nChiquita Brands International and Dole Food Company now account for most Honduran banana production and exports. Honduras's traditional system of independent banana producers, who, as late as the 1980s, sold their crops to the international banana companies, was eroded in the 1990s. In the absence of policies designed to protect independent suppliers, economically strapped cooperatives began to sell land to the two large corporations.\n\nAlthough Honduran banana production is dominated by multinational giants, such is not the case with coffee, which is grown by about 55,000 mostly small producers. Coffee production in Honduras has been high despite relatively low independent yields because of the large numbers of producers. Honduras, in fact, consistently produced more than its international quota until growers began to withhold the crop in the 1980s in an attempt to stimulate higher prices. Despite the efforts of the growers, coffee prices plunged on the international market from a high of more than $2.25 per kilogram in the mid-1970s to less than $0.45 per kilogram in the early 1990s. As a result of the declining prices, coffee producers were becoming increasingly marginalized. With the aid of affordable loans from foreign investors, more and more Honduran coffee growers are learning to produce high-value organic coffee for today's economy.\n\nThe outlook for the sugar industry, which had boomed during the 1980s when Honduran producers were allowed to fill Nicaragua's sugar quota to the United States, seemed bleak in 1993. Restoration of the sugar quota to Nicaraguan growers has been a major blow to Honduras's small independent producers, who had added most of Nicaragua's quota to their own during the United States embargo of Nicaragua. Higher costs for imported fertilizers because of the devaluation of the lempira add to the problem.\n\nHonduran producers seek relief from a relatively low official price of 25 lempiras per kilogram of sugar by smuggling sugar across the borders to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where the support prices are higher. Sugar growers who can afford it have begun to diversify by growing pineapples and rice. Many independent sugar growers, like independent banana producers, have become indignant over the relatively high profits shown by refiners and exporters. Strikes by producers at harvest time in 1991 forced the closure of the Choluteca refinery for a short time but had little effect on the depressed long-term outlook for the industry.\n\n===Nontraditional crops===\n\nWhile the total value of export merchandise fell in 1990 and 1991 and had still not recovered in 1993 to its 1989 level, the overall agricultural sector output has grown somewhat because of growth in the sale of winter vegetables and shrimp. Nontraditional vegetables and fruit produced $23.8&nbsp;million in export revenue in 1990, a figure that was almost double the 1983 figure. Nontraditional agricultural crops represented 4.8 percent of the value of total exports in 1990, compared to 2.8 percent in 1983.\n\nSome development experts argue that government protection of corn, bean, and rice production by small farmers is a futile effort in the long-term goal of poverty reduction. On the other hand, they see significant economic potential for nontraditional crops, if they are handled properly. Analysts also note, however, that Honduras is at a distinct disadvantage relative to its Central American neighbors because of its poor transportation system. Nontraditional exports require the ability to get fresh produce from the fields to distant markets rapidly.\n\n===Livestock===\n\nIn the early 1980s, the cattle industry appeared to have the potential to be an important part of the Honduran economy. The Honduran cattle sector, however, never developed to the extent that it did in much of the rest of Central America. Cattle production grew steadily until 1980\u201381 but then declined sharply when profits fell because of high production costs. The small Honduran meat packing industry declined at the same time, and several meat packing plants closed. As late as 1987, livestock composed 16 percent of the value-added agricultural sector but the industry continued to decline. By 1991\u201392, beef exports accounted for only 2.9 percent of the value of total exports.\n\nSales of refrigerated meat were the third or fourth highest source of export earnings in the mid-1980s, but like other Honduran agricultural products, beef yields were among the lowest in Central America. As world prices fell and production costs, exacerbated by drought, rose, there was less incentive to raise cattle. For a period of time, cattle farmers illegally smuggled beef cattle to Guatemala and other neighboring countries where prices were higher, but the Honduran cattle sector never became competitive internationally. The two large banana companies have also owned large cattle ranches where they raised prime beef, but these large companies had the flexibility to change crops as the market demanded.\n\nHonduran dairy herds fared about the same as beef cattle, and Honduran milk yields were also among the lowest in Central America. The dairy industry was further handicapped by the difficulties of trying to transport milk over poor roads in a tropical country, as well as by stiff competition in the domestic market from subsidized foreign imports, mostly from the United States.\n\n===Fishing===\n\nHonduras significantly developed its shrimp industry during the 1980s and in the Latin American market was second only to Ecuador in shrimp exports by 1991. In 1992 shrimp and lobster jumped to 12 percent of export earnings. Shrimp contributed $97&nbsp;million in export sales to the economy in 1992\u2014an increase of 33 percent over the previous year. The industry was dependent, however, on larvae imported from the United States to augment its unstable natural supply.\n\nTechnicians from Taiwan were contracted by large producers in 1991 to help develop laboratory larvae, but bitter feuds developed between independent shrimpers and the corporations. Local shrimpers charged that corporate methods were damaging the environment and destroying natural stock through destruction of the mangrove breeding swamps. Corporate shrimp farmers then began to move their operations farther inland, leaving local shrimpers to contend with diminished natural supplies on the mosquito-infested coast.\n\n===Forestry===\n\nAs in much of Central America, Honduras's once abundant forest resources have been badly squandered. In 1964 forests covered 6.8&nbsp;million hectares, but by 1988 forested areas had declined to 5&nbsp;million hectares. Honduras continued to lose about 3.6 percent of its remaining forests annually during the 1980s and early 1990s. The loss is attributable to several factors. Squatters have consistently used land suitable only for forests to grow scantyield food crops; large tracts have been cleared for cattle ranches; and the country has gravely mismanaged its timber resources, focusing far more effort on logging than on forestry management.\n\nThe government began an intensive forestry development program in 1974, supposedly intended to increase management of the sector and to prevent exploitation by foreign-owned firms. The Honduran Corporation for Forestry Development (Corporaci\u00f3n Hondure\u00f1a de Desarrollo Forestal\u2014Cohdefor) was created in 1974, but it quickly developed into a corrupt monopoly for overseeing forest exports. Timber was mostly produced by private sawmills under contracts selectively granted by Cohdefor officials.\n\nOngoing wasteful practices and an unsustainable debt, which was contracted to build infrastructure, appear to have undercut most conservation efforts. The military-dominated governments contracted huge debt with the multilateral development agencies, then extracted timber to pay for it. Cohdefor generally granted licenses to private lumber companies with few demands for preservation, and it had little inclination or incentive to enforce the demands it did make.\n\nWith encouragement from the United States Agency for International Development (AID), the Honduran government began to decentralize Cohdefor beginning in 1985. Under the decentralization plan, regulatory responsibilities were transferred from the central government to mayors and other municipal officials on the assumption that local officials would provide better oversight. Despite decentralization and the sale of government assets, Cohdefor's remaining debt was $240&nbsp;million in 1991. The government also assumed continued financial responsibility for the construction of a new airstrip in the area of timber extraction, upgrading facilities at [[Puerto Castilla, Honduras|Puerto Castilla]] and [[Puerto Lempira]], and providing electricity at reduced prices to lumber concerns as part of the privatization package.\n\nMajor legislation was passed in 1992 to promote Honduran reforestation by making large tracts of state-owned land more accessible to private investors. The legislation also supplied subsidies for development of the sector. The same law provided for replanting mountainous regions of the country with pine to be used for fuel.\n\n==Natural resources and energy==\nMining, the mainstay of the Honduran economy in the late 19th century, declined dramatically in importance in the 20th century. The New York and Honduras Rosario Mining Company (NYHRMC) produced $60&nbsp;million worth of gold and silver between 1882 and 1954 before discontinuing most of its operations.\n\nMining's contribution to the GDP steadily declined during the 1980s, to account for a 2 percent contribution in 1992. [[El Mochito mine]] in western Honduras, the largest mine in Central America, accounted for most mineral production. Ores containing gold, silver, lead, zinc, and cadmium were mined and exported to the United States and Europe for refining.\n\n===Energy sources===\n\nHonduras has for many years relied on fuelwood and biomass (mostly waste products from agricultural production) to supply its energy needs. The country has never been a producer of petroleum and depends on imported oil to fill much of its energy needs. In 1991 Honduras consumed about {{convert|16000|oilbbl}} of oil daily. Honduras spent about $143&nbsp;million, or 13 percent of its total export earnings, to purchase oil in 1991. The country's one small refinery at Puerto Cort\u00e9s closed in 1993.\n\nVarious Honduran governments have done little to encourage oil exploration, although substantial oil deposits have long been suspected in the R\u00edo Sula valley and offshore along the Caribbean coast. An oil exploration consortium consisting of the Venezuelan state oil company, Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc. ([[Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela]], S.A.--PDVSA), Cambria Oil, and [[Texaco]] expressed interest in the construction of a refinery at Puerto Castilla in 1993, with production aimed at the local market.\n\nFuelwood and biomass have traditionally met about 67 percent of the country's total energy demand; petroleum, 29 percent; and electricity, 4 percent. In 1987 Honduran households consumed approximately 60 percent of total energy used, transportation and agriculture used about 26 percent, and industry used about 14 percent. Food processing consumed about 50 percent of industrial sector energy, followed by petroleum and chemical manufacturing.\n\n===Electric power===\n\n{{Further|Electricity sector in Honduras}}\n\nHonduran electrification is low and uneven relative to other countries in Latin America. The World Bank estimates that only about 36 percent of the Honduran population had access to electricity (20 percent of the rural population) in 1987. The country's total capacity in 1992 was 575 megawatts (MW), with 2,000 megawatt-hours produced. A mammoth hydroelectric plant, the 292-MW project at [[El Caj\u00f3n Dam (Honduras)|El Caj\u00f3n]], began producing electricity in 1985 to help address the country's energy needs. The plant, however, soon became heavily indebted because of the government's electricity pricing policies (not charging public-sector institutions, for example) and because of the appointment of political cronies as top management officials. El Caj\u00f3n also developed costly structural problems requiring extensive maintenance and repairs.\n\nOfficials estimated that the government's decision to provide free service to public-sector institutions contributed to a 23 percent increase in publicsector consumption in 1990. Experts estimated that additional electrical generation capacity would likely be needed to keep pace with demand. The [[Honduran Congress]] assumed authority for setting electric prices beginning in 1986 but then became reluctant to increase rates. Under pressure from the World Bank, it did agree to a 60 percent increase in 1990, with additional increases in 1991. To offset these increased rates for residential users, the National Congress initiated a system of direct subsidies that ran through 1992.\n\n== Secondary and tertiary industries==\n\n===Manufacturing===\n\nThe country's manufacturing sector was small, contributing only 15 percent to the total GDP in 1992. Textile exports, primarily to the US, led the Honduran manufacturing sector. The maquiladora, or assembly industry, was a growth industry in the generally bleak economy. Asian-owned firms dominated the sector, with twenty-one South Korean-owned companies in export processing zones located in the R\u00edo Sula valley in 1991.\n\nThe maquiladoras employed approximately 16,000 workers in 1991; another nine firms opened in 1992. Job creation, in fact, is considered to be the primary contribution of the assembly operations to the domestic economy. The export textile manufacturing industry all but wiped out small, Honduran manufacturers, and food processors, whose goods were historically aimed at the domestic market, were also adversely affected.\n\nThe small Honduran firms could not begin to compete with the assembly industry for labor because of the maquiladoras' relatively high wage scale of close to $4 per day. Small firms also found it increasingly difficult to meet the high cost of mostly imported inputs. Membership in the Honduran Association of Small and Medium Industry (Asociaci\u00f3n Hondure\u00f1a de Empresas Peque\u00f1as y Medianas) declined by 70 percent by 1991, compared to pre-maquiladora days, foreshadowing the likely demise of most of the small shops.\n\nHonduran domestic manufacturers also suffered from increased Central American competition resulting from a trade liberalization pact signed in May 1991 by Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Overall, the Honduran manufacturing sector has mimicked other sectors of the economy\u2014it is mostly noncompetitive, even in a regional context, because of insufficient credit and the high cost of inputs. Relatively high interest rates and a complicated investment law have also inhibited the foreign-dominated manufacturing sector from taking off.\n\nThe government-sponsored Puerto Cort\u00e9s Free Zone was opened in 1976. By 1990 an additional five free zones were in operation in Omoa, Coloma, Tela, La Ceiba, and Amapala. A series of privately run [[Export Processing Zone]]s were also established in competition with the government-sponsored free zones. These privately run zones offered the same standard import-export incentives as the government zones. Most of the government and privately run zones were located along the Caribbean coast in a newly developing industrial belt.\n\nFirms operating outside of the special \"enterprise zones\" (either privately run, export-processing zones or government sponsored free zones) enjoy many of the same benefits as those operating within the zones. The Honduran Temporary Import Law permits companies that export 100 percent of their production to countries outside the CACM countries to hold ten-year exemptions on corporate income taxes and duty-free import of industrial inputs.\n\nAnalysts continue to debate the actual benefits of the shift away from the [[import-substitution industrialization]] (ISI) policies of the 1960s and 1970s toward a new focus on free zones and assembly industries in the 1990s. Critics point to the apparent lack of commitment by foreign manufactures to any one country site or to the creation of permanent infrastructure and employment. They question whether new employment will be enough to offset the loss of jobs in the more traditional manufacturing sector. A value of $195&nbsp;million to the Honduran economy from assembly industries in 1991\u2014when the value of clothing exports was greater than that of coffee\u2014was a compelling argument in favor of the shift, however.\n\n===Construction===\n\nHigh interests rates, particularly for housing, continued to hurt the Honduran construction industry in 1993, but danger from high rates was partially offset by some public-sector investment. Privatization of formerly state-owned industries through debt swaps also negatively affected construction as prices for basic materials such as cement increased and credit tightened. A major devaluation of the lempira added to the already high cost of construction imports. Construction contributed 6.0 percent to the GDP in 1992.\n\n===Banking===\n\nThe Honduran financial sector is small in comparison to the banking systems of its neighbors. After 1985, however, the sector began to grow rapidly. The average annual growth rate of value added to the economy from the financial sector for the 1980s was the second-highest in Latin America, averaging 4 percent. By 1985 Honduras had twenty-five financial institutions with 300 branch offices. Honduran commercial banks held 60 percent of the financial system's assets in 1985 and nearly 75 percent of all deposits. With the exception of the Armed Forces Social Security Institute, all commercial banks were privately owned, and most were owned by Honduran families. In 1985 there were two government-owned development banks in Honduras, one specializing in agricultural credit and the other providing financing to municipal governments.\n\nAt the behest of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, Honduras began a process of financial liberalization in 1990. The process began with the freeing of agricultural loan rates and was quickly followed by the freeing of loan rates in other sectors. Beginning in late 1991, Honduran banks were allowed to charge market rates for agricultural loans if they were using their own funds. By law, the banks had to report their rates to monetary authorities and could fix rates within two points of the announced rate.\n\nIn 1991 commercial banks pressured the government to reduce their 35 percent minimum reserve ratio. This rate remained standard until June 1993 when the minimum requirement was temporarily lifted to 42 percent. The rate was dropped to 36 percent three months later. The banks had excess reserves, and lending rates were in the area of 26 to 29 percent, with few borrowers. Prior to liberalization measures, the [[Central Bank of Honduras]] (Banco Central de Honduras) maintained interest rate controls, setting a 19 percent ceiling, with the market lending rate hovering around 26 percent in late 1991. With inflation hitting 33 percent in 1990, there was, in fact, a negative real interest rate, but this situation reversed in 1991 when rates were high relative to inflation. Rates of 35 to 43 percent in 1993 were well above the inflation rate of 13 to 14 percent. Bankers argued for further liberalization, including easing of controls in the housing and nonexport agricultural sectors.\n\nA Honduran stock exchange was established in August 1990 with transactions confined to trading debt. Nine companies were registered with the exchange in 1991; in 1993 this number had grown to eighteen. It appears doubtful, however, that the market will develop fully, given the reluctance of family-held firms to open their books to public scrutiny.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{main|Tourism in Honduras}}\nForeign tourists are attracted to Honduras by the Mayan ruins in [[Cop\u00e1n]] and coral reef skin-diving off the [[Islas de la Bah\u00eda]] (Bay Islands). Poor infrastructure, however, has discouraged the development of substantial international tourism. Despite these problems, the number of visitors arriving in Honduras rose from fewer than 200,000 in 1987 to almost 250,000 in 1989. Small [[ecotourism]] projects, in particular, are considered to have significant potential.\n\n==Trade==\n[[File:Honduras Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|450px|A proportional representation of Honduras' exports.]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, the United States was by far Honduras's leading trading partner, with Japan a distant second. United States exports to Honduras in 1992 were valued at US$533&nbsp;million, about 54 percent of the country's total imports of $983&nbsp;million. Most of the rest of Honduras's imports come from its Central American neighbors. Despite its status as a beneficiary of both the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) and the [[Generalized System of Preferences]] (GSP)--both of which confer duty-free status on Honduran imports to the United States\u2014Honduras has run a long-standing trade deficit with the United States.\n\nTotal exports of goods and services by Honduras in 1992 was $843&nbsp;million, of which about 52 percent went to the United States. The current amount exported by Honduras as of 2017 is $8.675 billion (USD$), with 34.5% of the said exports now going to the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/attachments/summaries/HO-summary.pdf|title=One Page Country Summary of Honduras|last=|first=|date=February 2019|website=CIA World Factbook|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/|archive-date=2019|access-date=September 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Linkages to the United States===\nAs with most Latin American countries, Honduras's economy is closely tied to the US. The US is Honduras's primary trading partner and the source of about two-thirds of the country's [[foreign direct investment]].\nUS [[Transnational corporation|multinationals]] [[Dole Food Company]] and [[Chiquita]] control a large portion of Honduras's agricultural exports. Presently, Honduras participates alongside the [[Rainforest Alliance]] for the exporting of agricultural goods to the US.\n\nHondurans working in the US send more than $2&nbsp;billion each year to their families in Honduras; these remittances account for 28.2% of Honduras's GDP (2007 information\n<ref>NotiCen, 29 November 2007, excerpted in University of California at San Diego libraries [http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/honduras/19982007.html Latin american election statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717061207/http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/honduras/19982007.html |date=17 July 2009 }}. Retrieved July 2009. NotiCen's source is probably the Latin American Development Bank.</ref>).\n\n==Foreign investment==\n\nWith the exception of relatively recent, Asian-dominated investment in assembly firms along Honduras's northern coast, the country remains heavily dependent on United States-based multinational corporations for most of its investment needs in the early 1990s. Overall investment as a percentage of GDP declined dramatically during the 1980s, from about 25 percent in 1980 to a meager 15 percent in 1990. Dole Food Company and Chiquita Brands International together have invested heavily in Honduran industries as diverse as breweries and plastics, cement, soap, cans, and shoes.\n\nAs Honduras enters the 1990s, it faces challenging economic problems. The solutions relied on in the past\u2014traditional export crops, the maquiladora assembly industry, and the 1980s' development schemes\u2014appear unlikely to provide enough new jobs for a rapidly growing population. The major economic challenge for Honduras over the next decade will be to find dependable sources of sustainable economic growth.\n\n==Statistics==\n\n*GDP\n** L 233&nbsp;billion (2007.)\n** US$12.3&nbsp;billion (2007.)\n** International dollars (purchasing power parity method) $24.69&nbsp;billion (2007 est.)<ref>L and US$ data are from [http://data.un.org United Nations data], National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates.

Leading export [[coffee]] (US$340&nbsp;million) accounted for 22% of total Honduran export revenues. Bananas, formerly the country's second-largest export until being virtually wiped out by 1998's [[Hurricane Mitch]], recovered in 2000 to 57% of pre-Mitch levels. [[shrimp|Cultivated shrimp]] is another important export sector. Since the late 1970s, towns in the north began industrial production through [[maquiladora]]s, especially in [[San Pedro Sula]] and [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]].\n\nHonduras has extensive forests, marine, and mineral [[Resource (economics)|resources]], although widespread [[slash and burn]] agricultural methods continue to destroy Honduran forests. The Honduran economy grew 4.8% in 2000, recovering from the Mitch-induced recession (\u22121.9%) of 1999. The Honduran [[maquiladora]] sector, the third-largest in the world, continued its strong performance in 2000, providing employment to over 120,000 and generating more than $528&nbsp; million in foreign exchange for the country. [[Inflation]], as measured by the [[consumer price index]], was 10.1% in 2000, down slightly from the 10.9% recorded in 1999. The country's international reserve position continued to be strong in 2000, at slightly over US$1 billion. Remittances from Hondurans living abroad (mostly in the US) rose 28% to $410&nbsp; million in 2000. The Lempira (currency) was [[devaluation|devaluing]] for many years but stabilized at L19 to the US dollar in 2005. The Honduran people are among the poorest in [[Latin America]]; [[gross national income]] per capita (2007) is US$1,649; the average for Central America is $6,736.<ref>[http://data.un.org United Nations data], National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates, Per capita GNI at current prices \u2013 US dollars.</ref>\nHonduras is the fourth poorest country in the [[Western Hemisphere]]; only [[Haiti]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Guyana]] are poorer. Using [[Gross domestic product#Limitations of GDP to judge the health of an economy|alternative]] statistical measurements in addition to the gross domestic product can provide greater context for the nation's poverty.\n\nThe country signed an [[Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility]] (ESAF) \u2013 later converted to a [[Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility]] (PRGF) with the [[International Monetary Fund]] in March 1999. Honduras (as of the about year 2000) continues to maintain stable [[macroeconomic policies]]. It not been swift to implementing structural changes such as privatization of the publicly owned telephone and energy distribution companies\u2014changes which are desired by the IMF and other international lenders. Honduras received significant debt relief in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Mitch]], including the suspension bilateral debt service payments and bilateral debt reduction by the [[Paris Club]]\u2014including the US \u2013 worth over $400&nbsp; million. In July 2000, Honduras reached its decision point under the [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] Initiative (HIPC), qualifying the country for interim multilateral debt relief.\n\nLand appears to be plentiful and readily exploitable, but the presence of apparently extensive land is misleading because the nation's rugged, mountainous terrain restricts large-scale agricultural production to narrow strips on the coasts and to a few fertile valleys. Honduras's manufacturing sector has not yet developed beyond simple textile and agricultural processing industries and assembly operations. The small domestic market and competition from more industrially advanced countries in the region have inhibited more complex [[industrialization]].\n\n==Economic history==\n[[File:Honduras econ 1983.jpg|thumb|550px|An economic activity map of Honduras, 1983.]]\n{{Underlinked|section|date=September 2018}}\nAfter Honduras achieved independence from [[Spain]] in the early 19th century, its economic growth became closely related to its ability to develop attractive export products. During much of the 19th century, the Honduran economy languished; traditional cattle raising and subsistence agriculture produced no suitable major export. In the latter part of the century, economic activity quickened with the development of large-scale, precious metal mining. The most important mines were in the mountains near the capital of Tegucigalpa and were owned by the [[Rosario Mining Company|New York and Honduras Rosario Mining Company]] (NYHRMC).\n\n[[Silver]] was the principal metal extracted, accounting for about 55% of exports in the 1880s. [[Mining]] income stimulated commercial and ancillary enterprises, built infrastructure, and reduced monetary restraints on trade. There were few other beneficial economic effects, however, because the [[mining industry]] was never well integrated into the rest of the [[Economy of Honduras|Honduran economy]]. The foreign mining companies employed a small [[workforce]], provided little or no government revenue, and relied mostly on imported mining equipment.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nHonduras's international economic activity surged in the early 20th century. Between 1913 and 1929, its agricultural exports rose from $3&nbsp;million ($2&nbsp;million from bananas) to $25&nbsp;million ($21&nbsp;million from bananas). These \"golden\" exports were supported by more than $40&nbsp;million of specialized banana company investment in the Honduran infrastructure and were safeguarded by US pressure on the national government when the companies felt threatened.\n\nThe overall performance of the Honduran economy remained closely tied to [[banana]] prices and production from the 1920s until after the mid-century because other forms of commercial export agriculture were slow to emerge. In addition, until drastically reduced in the mid-1950s, the workforce associated with banana cultivation represented a significant proportion of the wage earners in the country. Just before the banana industry's largest strike in 1954, approximately 35,000 workers held jobs on the banana plantations of the [[United Fruit Company]] (later United Brands Company, then Chiquita Brands International) or the [[Standard Fruit Company]] (later brought by Castle and Cook, then [[Dole Food Company]]).\n\nAfter 1950 Honduran governments encouraged agricultural modernization and export diversification by spending heavily on transportation and communications infrastructure, agricultural credit, and technical assistance. During the 1950s\u2014as a result of these improvements and the strong international export prices\u2014[[beef]], [[cotton]], and [[coffee]] became significant export products for the first time. Honduran [[sugar]], [[Lumber|timber]], and [[tobacco]] also were exported, and by 1960 bananas had declined to a more modest share (45 percent) of total exports. During the 1960s, industrial growth was stimulated by the establishment of the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM\u2014see Appendix B).\n\nAs a result of the reduction of regional [[trade barriers]] and the construction of a high [[common external tariff]], some Honduran manufactured products, such as soaps, sold successfully in other Central American countries. Because of the greater size and relative efficiency of the Salvadoran and Guatemalan industrial sectors, however, Honduras bought far more manufactured products from its neighbors than it sold to them. After the 1969 [[Soccer War]] with [[El Salvador]], Honduras effectively withdrew from the CACM. Favorable bilateral trade arrangements between Honduras and the other former CACM partners were subsequently negotiated, however.\n\n[[File:SanPedroSula.jpg|thumb|300px|Downtown [[San Pedro Sula]].]]\nA political shift in the 1980s had strong and unexpected repercussions on the country's economic condition. Beginning in late 1979, as insurgency spread in neighboring countries, Honduran military leaders enthusiastically came to support [[United States]] policies in the region. This alignment resulted in financial support that benefited the civilian as well as the military ministries and agencies of Honduras. Honduran defense spending rose throughout the 1980s until it consumed 20 to 30 percent of the national budget. Before the military buildup began in fiscal year (FY) 1980, United States military assistance to Honduras was less than US$4&nbsp;million. Military aid more than doubled to reach just under US$9&nbsp;million by FY 1981, surged to more than $31&nbsp;million by FY 1982, and stood at $48.3&nbsp;million in FY 1983. Tiny Honduras soon became the tenth largest recipient of United States assistance aid; total economic and military aid rose to more than $200&nbsp;million in 1985 and remained at more than $100&nbsp;million for the rest of the 1980s.\n\nThe increasing dependence of the Honduran economy on foreign aid was aggravated by a severe, regionwide economic decline during the 1980s. Private investment plummeted in 1980, and [[capital flight]] for that year was $500&nbsp;million. To make matters worse, coffee prices plunged on the international market in the mid-1980s and remained low throughout the decade. In 1993 average annual per capita income remained depressingly low at about $580, and 75 percent of the population was poor by internationally defined standards.\n\nTraditionally, Honduran economic hopes have been pinned on land and agricultural commodities. Despite those hopes, however, usable land has always been severely limited. Honduras's mostly mountainous terrain confines agriculturally exploitable land to narrow bands along the coasts and to some previously fertile but now largely depleted valleys. The country's once abundant forest resources have also been dramatically reduced, and Honduras has not derived economically significant income from mineral resources since the 19th century. Similarly, Honduras's industrial sector never was fully developed. The heady days of the CACM (mid to -late 1960s), which produced an industrial boom for El Salvador and Guatemala, barely touched the Honduran economy except to increase its imports because of the comparative advantages enjoyed by the Salvadoran and Guatemalan economies and Honduras's inability to compete.\n\nBananas and coffee have also proven unreliable sources of income. Although bananas are less subject to the vagaries of international markets than coffee, natural disasters such as [[Hurricane Fifi\u2013Orlene|Hurricane Fifi]] in 1974, drought, and disease have appeared with a regular, albeit random, frequency to take their economic toll through severely diminished [[harvests]]. Moreover, bananas are grown and marketed mostly by international corporations, which keep the bulk of wealth generated. Coffee exports, equally unreliable as a major source of economic support, surpassed bananas in the mid1970s as Honduras's leading export income earner, but international price declines coupled with huge fiscal deficits underlined the vulnerability of coffee as an economic base.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n{{Missing information|section|[[Effects of Hurricane Mitch in Honduras|the devastating effects of Hurricane Mitch on this nation]]. Didn't it cause a [[recession]] here in 1998?|date=September 2018}}\nAs Honduras entered the 1990s, it did have some factors working in its favor\u2014relative peace and a stronger civilian government with less military interference in the politics and economy of the country than in past years. The country was hobbled, however, by horrendous foreign debt, could claim only diminished natural resources, and had one of the fastest-growing and urbanizing populations in the world. The government's daunting task then became how to create an economic base able to compensate for the withdrawal of much United States assistance without becoming solely dependent on traditional agricultural exports.\n\nIn the 1990s, bananas were booming again, particularly as new European trade agreements increased market size. Small banana producing cooperatives lined up in the 1990s to sell their land to the commercial giants, and the last banana-producing lands held by the government were privatized. Like most of Central America, Honduras in the 1990s began to woo foreign investors, mostly Asian clothing assembly firms, and it held high hopes for revenue to be generated by privatizing national industries. With one of the most strike-prone labor forces in Central America, debt-burdened and aging industrial assets, and a dramatically underdeveloped infrastructure, Honduras, however, has distinct economic disadvantages relative to its Central American and Caribbean neighbors, who compete with Honduras in the same export markets.\n\nHonduran president [[Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero]], elected in November 1989, enjoyed little success in the early part of his administration as he attempted to adhere to a standard economic austerity package prescribed by the [[International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund (IMF)]] and the [[World Bank]]. As the November 1993 presidential elections drew closer, the political fallout of austere economic measures made their implementation even less likely. Any hope for his party's winning the 1993 election was predicated on improving social programs, addressing employment needs, and appeasing a disgruntled, vocal public sector. However, reaching those goals required policies that moved away from balancing the budget, lowering [[inflation]], and reducing the deficit and external debt to attract investment and stimulate economic growth.\n\nCallejas inherited an economic mess. The economy had deteriorated rapidly, starting in 1989, as the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (AID) pointedly interrupted disbursements of its grants to Honduras to signal displeasure with the economic policies of the old government and to push the new government to make economic reforms. Nondisbursal of those funds greatly exacerbated the country's economic problems. Funds from the multilateral lending institutions, which eventually would help fill the gap left by the reduction of United States aid, were still under negotiation in 1989 and would be conditioned first on payment of arrears on the country's enormous external debt.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1985, the government of Honduras\u2014pumped up by massive infusions of external borrowing\u2014had introduced expensive, high-tech infrastructure projects. The construction of roads and dams, financed mostly by multilateral loans and grants, was intended to generate employment to compensate for the impact of the regionwide recession. In reality, the development projects served to swell the ranks of public-sector employment and line the pockets of a small elite. The projects never sparked private-sector investment or created substantial private employment. Instead, per capita income continued to fall as Honduras's external debt doubled. Even greater injections of foreign assistance between 1985 and 1988 kept the economy afloat, but it soon became clear that the successive governments had been borrowing time as well as money.\n\nForeign aid between 1985 and 1989 represented about 4.6 percent of the [[gross domestic product (GDP)]]. About 44 percent of the government's fiscal shortfall was financed through cash from foreign sources. Side effects of the cash infusion were that the national currency, the lempira became overvalued and the number of exports dropped. A booming public sector, with its enhanced ability to import, was enough to keep the economy showing growth, based on private consumption and government spending. But the government did little to address the historical, underlying structural problems of the economy\u2014its overdependence on too few traditional commodities and lack of investment. Unemployment mushroomed, and private investment withered.\n\nBy 1989 president Callejas's broad economic goal became to return Honduran economic growth to 1960\u201380 levels. During the decades of the 1960s and 1970s, the country's economy, spurred mostly by erratically fluctuating traditional agricultural commodities, nevertheless averaged real annual growth of between 4 and 5 percent. At the end of the 1980s, however, Callejas had few remaining vehicles with which to pull the country out of the deep regionwide recession of the 1980s. Real growth between 1989 and 1993 translated to mostly negative or small positive per capita changes in the GDP for a population that was growing at close to 4 percent annually.\n\nPresident Callejas attempted to adhere to conditions of desperately needed new loans. Cutting the size of the public sector workforce, lowering the deficit, and enhancing revenues from taxes\u2014as mandated by the multilateral lending institutions\u2014were consistently his biggest stumbling blocks. Despite his all-out effort to reduce the public-sector deficit, the overall ratio of fiscal deficit to the GDP in 1990 showed little change from that in 1989. The total public-sector deficit actually grew to 8.6 percent of the GDP, or nearly L1&nbsp;billion, in 1991.\n\nThe 1993 deficit expanded to 10.6 percent of GDP. The Honduran government's medium-term economic objectives, as dictated by the IMF, were to have generated real GDP growth of 3.5 percent by 1992 and 4 percent by 1993. In fact, GDP growth was 3.3 percent in 1991, 5.6 percent in 1992, and an estimated 3.7 percent in 1993. The economy had operated so long on an ad hoc basis that it lacked the tools to implement coherent economic objectives. Solving the most immediate crisis frequently took precedence over long-term goals.\nInflation\n\nBy 1991 President Callejas had achieved modest success in controlling inflation. Overall inflation for 1990 had reached 36.4 percent\u2014not the hyperinflation experienced by some Latin American counties\u2014but still the highest annual rate for Honduras in forty years. The Honduran government and the IMF had set an inflation target of 12 percent for 1992 and 8 percent for 1993. The actual figures were 8.8 percent in 1992 and an estimated 10.7 percent for 1993. Hondurans had been accustomed to low inflation (3.4 percent in 1985, rising to 4.5 percent by the end of 1986), partly because pegging the lempira to the dollar-linked Honduras's inflation rate to inflation rates in developed countries. But the expectation for low inflation made the reality of high inflation that much worse and created additional pressures on the government for action when inflation soared in 1990.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://countrystudies.us/honduras/62.htm | title=Growth and Structure of the Economy | publisher=countrystudies.us | accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Unemployment==\n\nBetween 1980 and 1983, 20 percent of the workforce was unemployed\u2014double the percentage of the late 1970s. Job creation remained substantially behind the growth of the labor force throughout the 1980s. Unemployment grew to 25 percent by 1985, and combined unemployment and underemployment jumped to 40 percent in 1989. By 1993, 50 to 60 percent of the Honduran labor force was estimated to be either underemployed or unemployed.\n\nThe government's acceptance of foreign aid during the 1980s, in lieu of economic growth sparked by private investment, allowed it to ignore the necessity of creating new jobs. Honduras's GDP showed reasonable growth throughout most of the 1980s, especially when compared to the rest of Latin America, but it was artificially buoyed by private consumption and public-sector spending.\n\nMainstay agricultural jobs became scarcer in the late 1970s. Coffee harvests and plantings in border area decreased because fighting in neighboring Nicaragua and El Salvador spilled over into Honduras. Other factors contributing to the job scarcity were limited land, a reluctance on the part of coffee growers to invest while wars destabilized the region, and a lack of credit. Small farmers became increasingly unable to support themselves as their parcels of land diminished in size and productivity.\n\nProblems in the agricultural sector have fueled urbanization. The Honduran population was 77 percent rural in 1960. By 1992 only 55 percent of the Honduran population continued to live in rural areas. [[Peasant]]s (campesinos) flocked to the cities in search of work but found little there. Overall unemployment has been exacerbated by an influx of refugees from the wars in neighboring countries, attracted to Honduras, ironically, by its relatively low population density and relative peace. In the agricultural sector (which in 1993 still accounted for about 60 percent of the labor force), unemployment has been estimated to be far worse than the figures for the total labor force.\n\nHonduran urban employment in the early 1990s has been characterized by underemployment and marginal informal-sector jobs, as thousands of former agricultural workers and refugees have moved to the cities seeking better lives. Few new jobs have been generated in the formal sector, however, because the domestic private sector and foreign investments have dropped and coveted public-sector jobs have been reserved mostly for the small Honduran middle-class with political or military connections. Only one of ten Honduran workers were securely employed in the formal sector in 1991.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the World Bank reported that only 10,000 new jobs were created annually; the low rate of job creation resulted in 20,000 people being added to the ranks of the unemployed every year. The actual disparity between jobs needed for full employment and new jobs created exceeded that projection, however. For those with jobs, the buying power of their wages tumbled throughout the 1980s while the cost of basic goods, especially food, climbed precipitously.\n\n==Role of government==\n\nThroughout the 1960s and most of the 1970s, the military-led governments of Honduras ran a state-sponsored and state-financed economy. The governments provided most guarantees for loans to a strong but patronage-dominated and somewhat corrupt public sector that included recipients of graft extracted from foreign and domestic investors, and to costly state-developed enterprises. By 1989 and the election of president Callejas, however, a heavy toll had been taken by regionwide economic recession, civil war in neighboring countries, the drying up of most external credit, and capital flight equaling more than $1.5&nbsp;billion.\n\nCallejas began to shift economic policy toward privatizing government-owned enterprises, liberalizing trade and tariff regulations, and encouraging increased foreign investment through tax and other incentives. The Callejas administration did not seek less government control. Rather it changed the government's objectives by focusing on reducing public-sector spending, the size of the public-sector workforce, and the trade deficit. Overall economic planning became the responsibility of the National Superior Planning Council, directed by the minister of economy and commerce. President Callejas, a US-trained economist, brought new professionalism and technical skills to the central government as he began the arduous task of long-term economic reform.\n\nThe official exchange rate of the lempira, pegged at US$1=L2 since 1918, was dramatically devalued in 1990. Exchange controls had been introduced in 1982, resulting in a parallel currency market (black market) and several confusing official exchange rates operating simultaneously. Some of those rates were legally recognized in 1990 when President Callejas introduced a major series of economic policy reforms, which included reducing the maximum import tariff rate from 90 percent to 40 percent and getting rid of most surcharges and exemptions.\n\nThe value of the lempira was adjusted to US$1=L4, with the exception of the rate for debt equity conversions, which remained at the old rate of US$1=L2. The official conversion rate of the lempira fell to US$1=L7.26 in December 1993. The president also introduced temporary taxes on exports, which were intended to increase central government revenue. Additional price and trade liberalization measures and fewer government regulations became part of his ongoing reforms.\nBudget\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the Honduran government was heavily financed by foreign assistance. External financing\u2014mostly bilateral credit from the United States\u2014rose dramatically until it reached 87 percent of the public deficit in 1985, rising even further in subsequent years. By 1991 the public-sector deficit was entirely financed with net external credit. That financing permitted the government to reduce the demand for internal credit and, therefore, to maintain its established exchange rate.\n\nIn 1991 Callejas managed to give the appearance of having reduced the overall fiscal deficit, a requirement for new credit. But the deficit decrease was mostly an accounting device because it resulted from the postponement of external payments to the Paris Club debtors and eventually would be offset by pressure to raise public investment. During 1991, loan negotiations with multilateral and bilateral lending institutions brought Honduras $39.5&nbsp;million in United States development assistance, $70&nbsp;million in balance-of-payments assistance in the form of cash grants, and $18.8&nbsp;million in food aid.\n\nHonduras country also negotiated $302.4&nbsp;million in concessional loans from the multilateral lending institutions. Total outstanding external debt as a percentage of GDP fell from 119 percent in 1990 to 114 percent in 1991 and to 112 percent in 1993. This drop was largely the result of debt forgiveness of $448.4&nbsp;million by the United States, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Scheduled amortization payments of an average $223.2&nbsp;million per year, however, guaranteed that Honduras's gross funding requirements would remain large indefinitely.\n\nThe government of Honduras projected that overall tax revenues would increase from 13.2 percent of GDP in 1989 to about 15.7 percent in 1991. Adjustments for low coffee prices and the continuation of lax collection methods, however, undermined those goals. Despite these tax increases, compared to developed countries, Honduras has low tax rates with, particularly low property taxes.\n\n==Labor force==\n\nHonduras suffers from an overabundance of unskilled and uneducated laborers. Most Honduran workers in 1993 continued to be employed in agriculture, which accounted for about 60 percent of the labor force. More than half of the rural population, moreover, remains landless and heavily dependent on diminishing seasonal labor and low wages. Fifty-five percent of the farming population subsists on less than two [[hectares]] and earns less than $70 per capita per year from those plots, mostly by growing subsistence food crops.\n\nIn 1993 only about 9\u201313 percent of the Honduran labor force was engaged in the country's tiny manufacturing sector\u2014one of the smallest in Central America. Skilled laborers are scarce. Only 25,000 people per year, of which about 21 percent are industrial workers, graduate yearly from the National Institute of Professional Training (Instituto Nacional de Formaci\u00f3n Profesional- -INFOP) established in 1972.\n\nHundreds of small manufacturing firms, the traditional backbone of Honduran enterprise, began to go out of business beginning in the early 1990s, as import costs rose and competition through increasing wages for skilled labor from the mostly Asian-owned assembly industries strengthened. The small Honduran shops, most of which had manufactured clothing or food products for the domestic market, traditionally received little support in the form of credit from the government or the private sector and were more like artisans than conventional manufacturers. Asian-owned export assembly firms (maquiladoras), operating mostly in free zones established by the government on the Caribbean coast, attract thousands of job seekers and swell the populations of new city centers such as San Pedro Sula, [[Tela]], and [[La Ceiba]]. Those firms employ approximately 16,000 workers in 1991.\n\nAbout one-third of the Honduran labor force was estimated to be working in the service or \"other\" sector in 1993. That classification usually means that a person ekes out a precarious livelihood in the urban informal sector or as a poorly paid domestic. As unemployment soared throughout Central America in the 1980s, more and more people were forced to rely on their own ingenuity in order to simply exist on the fringes of Honduran society.\n\nAs for the informal sector, research has shown that evidence of [[child labor]] has been observed mostly in the Honduran agricultural sector.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/honduras.htm |title=Honduras 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor |access-date=18 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328232751/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/honduras.htm |archive-date=28 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2014, the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' cites three goods produced in such working conditions in Honduras; namely [[Coffee production in Honduras|coffee]], lobsters and melons.\n\n===Employment indicators and benefits===\n\nHonduran governments have set minimum wages since 1974, but enforcement has generally been lax. That laxity increased at the beginning of the 1980s. Traditionally, most Honduran workers have not been covered by social security, welfare, or minimum wages. Multinational companies usually paid more than the standard minimum wage, but, overall, the Honduran wage earner has experienced a diminution of real wages and purchasing ability for more than a decade. When they occurred, minimum wage adjustments generally did not keep up with the cost of living increases.\n\nAfter a major currency devaluation in 1990, average Honduran workers were among the most poorly paid workers in the Western Hemisphere. By contrast, the banana companies paid relatively high wages as early as the 1970s. Banana workers continued at the top of the wage scale in the 1990s; however, in the 1980s, as banana production became less labor-intensive, the companies had decreased their investment and workforce. Consequently, fewer workers were employed as relatively well-paid agricultural wage earners with related benefits.\n\nPresident Callejas responded to the severe poverty by implementing a specially financed Honduran Social Investment Fund (Fondo Hondure\u00f1o de Inversi\u00f3n Social\u2014FHIS) in 1990. The fund created public works programs such as road maintenance and provided United States surplus food to mothers and infants. Many Hondurans slipped through that fragile [[social safety net]]. As a continuing part of the social pact, and even more as the result of a fierce union-government battle, President Callejas announced in 1991 a 27.8 percent increase over a minimum wage that the government had earlier agreed upon. That increase was in addition to raises of 50 and 22 percent set, respectively, in January and September 1990. Despite those concessions, the minimum daily rate in 1991 was only $1.75 for workers employed by small agricultural enterprises and $3.15 for workers in the big exporting concerns; most workers did not earn the minimum wage.\n\n===Labor unions===\n\nHonduras has long been heavily unionized. In 1993 approximately 15 to 20 percent of the overall formal workforce was represented by some type of union, and about 40 percent of urban workers were union members. There were forty-eight strikes in the public sector alone in 1990, protesting the government's economic austerity program and layoffs of public-sector workers. More than 4,000 public-sector employees from the Ministry of Communications, Public Works, and Transport were fired in 1990. About 70,000 unionized workers remained in the faltering public sector at the beginning of 1991. However, the government largely made good its pledge to trim that number by 8,000 to 10,000 throughout 1991 as part of its austerity program.\n\nIn the private sector, 1990 saw 94 strikes in 64 firms, as workers fought for wage increases to combat inflation. A forty-two-day strike at the Tela Railroad Company (owned by [[Chiquita Brands International]]\u2014formerly United Brands and United Fruit Company) was unsuccessful, however, and that defeat temporarily ended union efforts at direct confrontation.\n\nIn 1993 Honduras had three major labor confederations: the [[Confederation of Honduran Workers]] (Confederaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores de Honduras\u2014CTH), claiming a membership of about 160,000 workers; the [[General Workers Central]] (Central General de Trabajadores\u2014CGT), claiming to represent 120,000 members; and the Unitary Confederation of Honduran Workers ([[Confederaci\u00f3n Unitaria de Trabajadores de Honduras]]\u2014CUTH), a new confederation formed in May 1992, with an estimated membership of about 30,000. The three confederations included numerous trade union federations, individual unions, and peasant organizations.\n\nThe CTH, the nation's largest trade confederation, was formed in 1964 by the nation's largest peasant organization, the National Association of Honduran Peasants (Asociaci\u00f3n Nacional de Campesinos de Honduras\u2014Anach), and by Honduran unions affiliated with the [[Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers]] (Organizaci\u00f3n Regional Interamericana de Trabajadores\u2014ORIT), a hemispheric labor organization with close ties to the [[American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (AFL-CIO).\n\nIn the early 1990s, the confederation had three major components: the 45,000-member Federation of Unions of National Workers of Honduras (Federaci\u00f3n Sindical de Trabajadores Nacionales de Honduras\u2014Fesitranh); the 22,000 member Central Federation of Honduran Free Trade Unions (Federaci\u00f3n Central de Sindicatos Libres de Honduras); and the 2,200-member Federation of National Maritime Unions of Honduras (Federaci\u00f3n de Sindicales Mar\u00edtimas Nacionales de Honduras). In addition, Anach, claiming to represent between 60,000 and 80,000 members, was affiliated with Fesitranh.\n\nFesitranh was by far the country's most powerful labor federation, with most of its unions located in San Pedro Sula and the Puerto Cort\u00e9s Free Zone. The unions of the United States-owned banana companies and the United States-owned petroleum refinery also were affiliated with Fesitranh. The CTH received support from foreign labor organizations, including [[ORIT]], the [[American Institute for Free Labor Development]] (AIFLD), and Germany's [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]] and was an affiliate of the [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] (ICFTU).\n\nAlthough it was not legally recognized until 1982, the CGT was originally formed in 1970 by the [[Christian Democratic Party of Honduras|Christian Democrats]] and received external support from the [[World Confederation of Labour]] (WCL) and the Latin American Workers Central (Central Latinoamericana de Trabajadores\u2014CLAT), a regional organization supported by Christian Democratic parties. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, the CGT leadership developed close ties to the [[National Party of Honduras]] (Partido Nacional de Honduaras\u2014PNH), and several leaders served in the Callejas government. Another national peasant organization, the National Union of Peasants (Uni\u00f3n Nacional de Campesinos\u2014UNC), claiming a membership of 40,000, was affiliated with the CGT for many years and was a principal force within the confederation.\n\nThe CUTH was formed in May 1992 by two principal labor federations, the Unitary Federation of Honduran Workers ([[Federaci\u00f3n Unitaria de Trabajadores de Honduras]]\u2014FUTH) and the Independent Federation of Honduran Workers (Federaci\u00f3n Independiente de Trabajadores de Honduras\u2014FITH), as well as several smaller labor groups, all critical of the Callejas government's neoliberal economic reform program.\n\nThe Marxist [[FUTH]], with an estimated 16,000 members in the early 1990s, was first organized in 1980 by three communist-influenced unions, but did not receive legal status until 1988. The federation had external ties with the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] (WFTU), the Permanent Congress for Latin American Workers Trade Union Unity (Congreso Permanente de Unidad Sindical de Trabajadores de Am\u00e9rica Latina\u2014CPUSTAL), and the Central American Committee of Trade Union Unity (Comit\u00e9 de Unidad Sindical de Centroam\u00e9rica\u2014CUSCA). Its affiliations included water utility, university, electricity company, brewery, and teacher unions, as well as several peasant organizations, including the National Central of Farm Workers (Central Nacional de Trabajadores del Campo\u2014CNTC), formed in 1985 and active in land occupations in the early 1980s.\n\nFUTH also became affiliated with a number of leftist popular organizations in a group known as the Coordinating Committee of Popular Organizations (Comit\u00e9 Coordinadora de las Organizaciones Populares\u2014CCOP) that was formed in 1984. Dissident FUTH member formed the FITH, which was granted legal status in 1988. The FITH consisted of fourteen unions claiming about 13,000 members in the early 1990s.\n\n==Agriculture and land use==\n[[File:Colbanana04.jpg|thumb|175px|Bananas are one of Honduras' main exports.]]\n\nThe total land area of Honduras is 11.2&nbsp;million hectares, of which a scant 1.7&nbsp;million hectares (about 15 percent) are well suited for agriculture. Most land in Honduras is covered by mountains, giving rise to the country's nickname, \"the Tibet of Central America.\" Nevertheless, the Honduran economy has always depended almost exclusively on agriculture, and in 1992 agriculture was still the largest sector of the economy, contributing 28 percent to the GDP.\n\nLess than half of Honduras's cultivable land was planted with [[crops]] as recently as the mid-1980s. The rest was used for pastures or was forested and was owned by the government or the banana corporations. Potential for additional productivity from fallow land was questionable, however, because much of Honduras's soil lacks the thick volcanic ash found elsewhere in Central America. By 1987 about 750,000 hectares of Honduran land had been seriously eroded as a result of misuse by cattle ranchers and slash-and-burn squatters who planted unsuitable food crops.\n\nThe Honduran government and two banana companies\u2014Chiquita Brands International and Dole Food Company\u2014owned approximately 60 percent of Honduras's cultivable land in 1993. The banana companies acquired most of their landholdings in the early 20th century in return for building the railroads used to transport bananas from the interior to the coast. Much of their land remained unused because it lacked irrigation. Only about 14 percent of cultivated land was irrigated in 1987. Most land under cultivation in 1992 was planted in bananas, coffee, and specialized export crops such as melons and winter vegetables.\n\n===Agricultural policy===\n\nThe agricultural sector's output showed little or no growth between 1970 and 1985. As a result of favorable weather and market conditions beginning in 1995, however, the agricultural sector grew at a rate of 2.6 percent annually, slightly above the average for Latin America during that period. Production of basic grains and coffee increased; the export price of bananas was high; and pork, poultry, and milk produced for the domestic market increased. Nontraditional fruits and vegetables also increased in value.\n\nHonduran agricultural production overall has tended to be low because the amount of crop yielded by a given amount of land has been low. For example, Honduran chocolate yields historically have been only about half those of Costa Rica. Instead of using improved techniques to increase the productivity of the land, Honduran farmers have merely expanded the hectarage under cultivation to produce more crops\u2014pushing their fields ever farther into the forests. Given the limited amount of good quality agricultural land, to begin with, that policy has resulted in continual deforestation and subsequent erosion. This reluctance to improve techniques, coupled with generally poor soil, a lack of credit, and poor infrastructure, has contributed to low production figures.\n\n===Land reform===\n\nThe Honduran government nominally began to address inequitable land ownership in the early 1960s. Those efforts at reform focused on organizing rural cooperatives. About 1,500 hectares of government-owned land were distributed by the National Agrarian Institute (Instituto Nacional Agrario\u2014INA) beginning in 1960.\n\nA [[1963 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup in 1963]] resulted in an end to the land reform program. Lacking even modest government-directed land reforms, illegal [[squatting]] became the primary means for poor people to gain land throughout the early 1970s. These actions spurred the government to institute new agrarian reforms in 1972 and 1975. Although all lands planted in export crops were exempted from reform, about 120,000 hectares were, nevertheless, divided among 35,000 poor families.\n\nBy 1975 the pendulum had swung back, and agrarian reform was all but halted. From 1975 through the 1980s, illegal occupations of unused land increased once again. The need for land reform was addressed mostly by laws directed at granting titles to squatters and other landholders, permitting them to sell their land or to use it as collateral for loans.\n\nDespite declarations by the Callejas government in 1989 of its intent to increasingly address social issues, including land tenure and other needs of small farmers, the early 1990s were jolted by increased conflicts between peasants and the Honduran security forces. Agricultural credit and government support increasingly favored export crop producers at the expense of producers of basic food crops.\n\nThe Honduran land reform process under President Callejas between 1989 and 1992 was directed primarily at large agricultural landowners. An agrarian pact, signed by landowners and peasant organizations in August 1990, remained underfunded and largely unimplemented. Furthermore, violence erupted as discharged members of the Honduran military forcibly tried to claim land that had already been awarded to the peasant organization Anach in 1976.\n\nIn May 1991, violence initiated by members of the Honduran military resulted in the deaths of eight farmers. To keep similar situations around the country from escalating into violence, the government promised to parcel out land belonging to the National Corporation for Investment (Corporaci\u00f3n Nacional de Inversiones\u2014Conadin). The government also pledged to return to peasants land that had been confiscated by the Honduran military in 1983.\n\nAn Agricultural Modernization Law, passed in 1992, accelerated [[land titling]] and altered the structure of land cooperatives formed in the 1960s. The law permitted cooperative members to break up their holdings into small personal plots that could be sold. As a result, some small banana producers suffering from economic hard times chose to sell their land to the giant banana producers. After an agreement was reached with the European Union (EU) to increase Honduras's banana quota to the EU, the large banana companies were avid for additional land for increased production to meet the anticipated new demand from Europe.\n\n===Traditional crops===\n\nThroughout the 20th century, Honduras's agriculture has been dominated first by bananas and then to a lesser extent by coffee and sugar. In 1992, bananas and coffee together accounted for 50 percent of the value of Honduran exports and made the biggest contribution to the economy. Total banana sales were $287&nbsp;million and total coffee sales amounted to $148&nbsp;million. These figures are impressive yet reflect production losses suffered by banana producers and the withholding of coffee exports from the market in an effort to fight steep price declines.\n\nAnother major blow to Honduran agriculture came from Hurricane Mitch and its aftermath in 1998 and 1999. As of 2012 both industries are on the upswing. The banana industry is dominated by [[Chiquita]] and the [[Dole Food Company]], two multinational corporations. The coffee industry, in contrast, offers better opportunities for small Honduran family farms to compete. Sugar has also been an important Honduran crop.\n\nChiquita Brands International and Dole Food Company now account for most Honduran banana production and exports. Honduras's traditional system of independent banana producers, who, as late as the 1980s, sold their crops to the international banana companies, was eroded in the 1990s. In the absence of policies designed to protect independent suppliers, economically strapped cooperatives began to sell land to the two large corporations.\n\nAlthough Honduran banana production is dominated by multinational giants, such is not the case with coffee, which is grown by about 55,000 mostly small producers. Coffee production in Honduras has been high despite relatively low independent yields because of the large numbers of producers. Honduras, in fact, consistently produced more than its international quota until growers began to withhold the crop in the 1980s in an attempt to stimulate higher prices. Despite the efforts of the growers, coffee prices plunged on the international market from a high of more than $2.25 per kilogram in the mid-1970s to less than $0.45 per kilogram in the early 1990s. As a result of the declining prices, coffee producers were becoming increasingly marginalized. With the aid of affordable loans from foreign investors, more and more Honduran coffee growers are learning to produce high-value organic coffee for today's economy.\n\nThe outlook for the sugar industry, which had boomed during the 1980s when Honduran producers were allowed to fill Nicaragua's sugar quota to the United States, seemed bleak in 1993. Restoration of the sugar quota to Nicaraguan growers has been a major blow to Honduras's small independent producers, who had added most of Nicaragua's quota to their own during the United States embargo of Nicaragua. Higher costs for imported fertilizers because of the devaluation of the lempira add to the problem.\n\nHonduran producers seek relief from a relatively low official price of 25 lempiras per kilogram of sugar by smuggling sugar across the borders to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where the support prices are higher. Sugar growers who can afford it have begun to diversify by growing pineapples and rice. Many independent sugar growers, like independent banana producers, have become indignant over the relatively high profits shown by refiners and exporters. Strikes by producers at harvest time in 1991 forced the closure of the Choluteca refinery for a short time but had little effect on the depressed long-term outlook for the industry.\n\n===Nontraditional crops===\n\nWhile the total value of export merchandise fell in 1990 and 1991 and had still not recovered in 1993 to its 1989 level, the overall agricultural sector output has grown somewhat because of growth in the sale of winter vegetables and shrimp. Nontraditional vegetables and fruit produced $23.8&nbsp;million in export revenue in 1990, a figure that was almost double the 1983 figure. Nontraditional agricultural crops represented 4.8 percent of the value of total exports in 1990, compared to 2.8 percent in 1983.\n\nSome development experts argue that government protection of corn, bean, and rice production by small farmers is a futile effort in the long-term goal of poverty reduction. On the other hand, they see significant economic potential for nontraditional crops, if they are handled properly. Analysts also note, however, that Honduras is at a distinct disadvantage relative to its Central American neighbors because of its poor transportation system. Nontraditional exports require the ability to get fresh produce from the fields to distant markets rapidly.\n\n===Livestock===\n\nIn the early 1980s, the cattle industry appeared to have the potential to be an important part of the Honduran economy. The Honduran cattle sector, however, never developed to the extent that it did in much of the rest of Central America. Cattle production grew steadily until 1980\u201381 but then declined sharply when profits fell because of high production costs. The small Honduran meat packing industry declined at the same time, and several meat packing plants closed. As late as 1987, livestock composed 16 percent of the value-added agricultural sector but the industry continued to decline. By 1991\u201392, beef exports accounted for only 2.9 percent of the value of total exports.\n\nSales of refrigerated meat were the third or fourth highest source of export earnings in the mid-1980s, but like other Honduran agricultural products, beef yields were among the lowest in Central America. As world prices fell and production costs, exacerbated by drought, rose, there was less incentive to raise cattle. For a period of time, cattle farmers illegally smuggled beef cattle to Guatemala and other neighboring countries where prices were higher, but the Honduran cattle sector never became competitive internationally. The two large banana companies have also owned large cattle ranches where they raised prime beef, but these large companies had the flexibility to change crops as the market demanded.\n\nHonduran dairy herds fared about the same as beef cattle, and Honduran milk yields were also among the lowest in Central America. The dairy industry was further handicapped by the difficulties of trying to transport milk over poor roads in a tropical country, as well as by stiff competition in the domestic market from subsidized foreign imports, mostly from the United States.\n\n===Fishing===\n\nHonduras significantly developed its shrimp industry during the 1980s and in the Latin American market was second only to Ecuador in shrimp exports by 1991. In 1992 shrimp and lobster jumped to 12 percent of export earnings. Shrimp contributed $97&nbsp;million in export sales to the economy in 1992\u2014an increase of 33 percent over the previous year. The industry was dependent, however, on larvae imported from the United States to augment its unstable natural supply.\n\nTechnicians from Taiwan were contracted by large producers in 1991 to help develop laboratory larvae, but bitter feuds developed between independent shrimpers and the corporations. Local shrimpers charged that corporate methods were damaging the environment and destroying natural stock through destruction of the mangrove breeding swamps. Corporate shrimp farmers then began to move their operations farther inland, leaving local shrimpers to contend with diminished natural supplies on the mosquito-infested coast.\n\n===Forestry===\n\nAs in much of Central America, Honduras's once abundant forest resources have been badly squandered. In 1964 forests covered 6.8&nbsp;million hectares, but by 1988 forested areas had declined to 5&nbsp;million hectares. Honduras continued to lose about 3.6 percent of its remaining forests annually during the 1980s and early 1990s. The loss is attributable to several factors. Squatters have consistently used land suitable only for forests to grow scantyield food crops; large tracts have been cleared for cattle ranches; and the country has gravely mismanaged its timber resources, focusing far more effort on logging than on forestry management.\n\nThe government began an intensive forestry development program in 1974, supposedly intended to increase management of the sector and to prevent exploitation by foreign-owned firms. The Honduran Corporation for Forestry Development (Corporaci\u00f3n Hondure\u00f1a de Desarrollo Forestal\u2014Cohdefor) was created in 1974, but it quickly developed into a corrupt monopoly for overseeing forest exports. Timber was mostly produced by private sawmills under contracts selectively granted by Cohdefor officials.\n\nOngoing wasteful practices and an unsustainable debt, which was contracted to build infrastructure, appear to have undercut most conservation efforts. The military-dominated governments contracted huge debt with the multilateral development agencies, then extracted timber to pay for it. Cohdefor generally granted licenses to private lumber companies with few demands for preservation, and it had little inclination or incentive to enforce the demands it did make.\n\nWith encouragement from the United States Agency for International Development (AID), the Honduran government began to decentralize Cohdefor beginning in 1985. Under the decentralization plan, regulatory responsibilities were transferred from the central government to mayors and other municipal officials on the assumption that local officials would provide better oversight. Despite decentralization and the sale of government assets, Cohdefor's remaining debt was $240&nbsp;million in 1991. The government also assumed continued financial responsibility for the construction of a new airstrip in the area of timber extraction, upgrading facilities at [[Puerto Castilla, Honduras|Puerto Castilla]] and [[Puerto Lempira]], and providing electricity at reduced prices to lumber concerns as part of the privatization package.\n\nMajor legislation was passed in 1992 to promote Honduran reforestation by making large tracts of state-owned land more accessible to private investors. The legislation also supplied subsidies for development of the sector. The same law provided for replanting mountainous regions of the country with pine to be used for fuel.\n\n==Natural resources and energy==\nMining, the mainstay of the Honduran economy in the late 19th century, declined dramatically in importance in the 20th century. The New York and Honduras Rosario Mining Company (NYHRMC) produced $60&nbsp;million worth of gold and silver between 1882 and 1954 before discontinuing most of its operations.\n\nMining's contribution to the GDP steadily declined during the 1980s, to account for a 2 percent contribution in 1992. [[El Mochito mine]] in western Honduras, the largest mine in Central America, accounted for most mineral production. Ores containing gold, silver, lead, zinc, and cadmium were mined and exported to the United States and Europe for refining.\n\n===Energy sources===\n\nHonduras has for many years relied on fuelwood and biomass (mostly waste products from agricultural production) to supply its energy needs. The country has never been a producer of petroleum and depends on imported oil to fill much of its energy needs. In 1991 Honduras consumed about {{convert|16000|oilbbl}} of oil daily. Honduras spent about $143&nbsp;million, or 13 percent of its total export earnings, to purchase oil in 1991. The country's one small refinery at Puerto Cort\u00e9s closed in 1993.\n\nVarious Honduran governments have done little to encourage oil exploration, although substantial oil deposits have long been suspected in the R\u00edo Sula valley and offshore along the Caribbean coast. An oil exploration consortium consisting of the Venezuelan state oil company, Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc. ([[Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela]], S.A.--PDVSA), Cambria Oil, and [[Texaco]] expressed interest in the construction of a refinery at Puerto Castilla in 1993, with production aimed at the local market.\n\nFuelwood and biomass have traditionally met about 67 percent of the country's total energy demand; petroleum, 29 percent; and electricity, 4 percent. In 1987 Honduran households consumed approximately 60 percent of total energy used, transportation and agriculture used about 26 percent, and industry used about 14 percent. Food processing consumed about 50 percent of industrial sector energy, followed by petroleum and chemical manufacturing.\n\n===Electric power===\n\n{{Further|Electricity sector in Honduras}}\n\nHonduran electrification is low and uneven relative to other countries in Latin America. The World Bank estimates that only about 36 percent of the Honduran population had access to electricity (20 percent of the rural population) in 1987. The country's total capacity in 1992 was 575 megawatts (MW), with 2,000 megawatt-hours produced. A mammoth hydroelectric plant, the 292-MW project at [[El Caj\u00f3n Dam (Honduras)|El Caj\u00f3n]], began producing electricity in 1985 to help address the country's energy needs. The plant, however, soon became heavily indebted because of the government's electricity pricing policies (not charging public-sector institutions, for example) and because of the appointment of political cronies as top management officials. El Caj\u00f3n also developed costly structural problems requiring extensive maintenance and repairs.\n\nOfficials estimated that the government's decision to provide free service to public-sector institutions contributed to a 23 percent increase in publicsector consumption in 1990. Experts estimated that additional electrical generation capacity would likely be needed to keep pace with demand. The [[Honduran Congress]] assumed authority for setting electric prices beginning in 1986 but then became reluctant to increase rates. Under pressure from the World Bank, it did agree to a 60 percent increase in 1990, with additional increases in 1991. To offset these increased rates for residential users, the National Congress initiated a system of direct subsidies that ran through 1992.\n\n== Secondary and tertiary industries==\n\n===Manufacturing===\n\nThe country's manufacturing sector was small, contributing only 15 percent to the total GDP in 1992. Textile exports, primarily to the US, led the Honduran manufacturing sector. The maquiladora, or assembly industry, was a growth industry in the generally bleak economy. Asian-owned firms dominated the sector, with twenty-one South Korean-owned companies in export processing zones located in the R\u00edo Sula valley in 1991.\n\nThe maquiladoras employed approximately 16,000 workers in 1991; another nine firms opened in 1992. Job creation, in fact, is considered to be the primary contribution of the assembly operations to the domestic economy. The export textile manufacturing industry all but wiped out small, Honduran manufacturers, and food processors, whose goods were historically aimed at the domestic market, were also adversely affected.\n\nThe small Honduran firms could not begin to compete with the assembly industry for labor because of the maquiladoras' relatively high wage scale of close to $4 per day. Small firms also found it increasingly difficult to meet the high cost of mostly imported inputs. Membership in the Honduran Association of Small and Medium Industry (Asociaci\u00f3n Hondure\u00f1a de Empresas Peque\u00f1as y Medianas) declined by 70 percent by 1991, compared to pre-maquiladora days, foreshadowing the likely demise of most of the small shops.\n\nHonduran domestic manufacturers also suffered from increased Central American competition resulting from a trade liberalization pact signed in May 1991 by Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Overall, the Honduran manufacturing sector has mimicked other sectors of the economy\u2014it is mostly noncompetitive, even in a regional context, because of insufficient credit and the high cost of inputs. Relatively high interest rates and a complicated investment law have also inhibited the foreign-dominated manufacturing sector from taking off.\n\nThe government-sponsored Puerto Cort\u00e9s Free Zone was opened in 1976. By 1990 an additional five free zones were in operation in Omoa, Coloma, Tela, La Ceiba, and Amapala. A series of privately run [[Export Processing Zone]]s were also established in competition with the government-sponsored free zones. These privately run zones offered the same standard import-export incentives as the government zones. Most of the government and privately run zones were located along the Caribbean coast in a newly developing industrial belt.\n\nFirms operating outside of the special \"enterprise zones\" (either privately run, export-processing zones or government sponsored free zones) enjoy many of the same benefits as those operating within the zones. The Honduran Temporary Import Law permits companies that export 100 percent of their production to countries outside the CACM countries to hold ten-year exemptions on corporate income taxes and duty-free import of industrial inputs.\n\nAnalysts continue to debate the actual benefits of the shift away from the [[import-substitution industrialization]] (ISI) policies of the 1960s and 1970s toward a new focus on free zones and assembly industries in the 1990s. Critics point to the apparent lack of commitment by foreign manufactures to any one country site or to the creation of permanent infrastructure and employment. They question whether new employment will be enough to offset the loss of jobs in the more traditional manufacturing sector. A value of $195&nbsp;million to the Honduran economy from assembly industries in 1991\u2014when the value of clothing exports was greater than that of coffee\u2014was a compelling argument in favor of the shift, however.\n\n===Construction===\n\nHigh interests rates, particularly for housing, continued to hurt the Honduran construction industry in 1993, but danger from high rates was partially offset by some public-sector investment. Privatization of formerly state-owned industries through debt swaps also negatively affected construction as prices for basic materials such as cement increased and credit tightened. A major devaluation of the lempira added to the already high cost of construction imports. Construction contributed 6.0 percent to the GDP in 1992.\n\n===Banking===\n\nThe Honduran financial sector is small in comparison to the banking systems of its neighbors. After 1985, however, the sector began to grow rapidly. The average annual growth rate of value added to the economy from the financial sector for the 1980s was the second-highest in Latin America, averaging 4 percent. By 1985 Honduras had twenty-five financial institutions with 300 branch offices. Honduran commercial banks held 60 percent of the financial system's assets in 1985 and nearly 75 percent of all deposits. With the exception of the Armed Forces Social Security Institute, all commercial banks were privately owned, and most were owned by Honduran families. In 1985 there were two government-owned development banks in Honduras, one specializing in agricultural credit and the other providing financing to municipal governments.\n\nAt the behest of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, Honduras began a process of financial liberalization in 1990. The process began with the freeing of agricultural loan rates and was quickly followed by the freeing of loan rates in other sectors. Beginning in late 1991, Honduran banks were allowed to charge market rates for agricultural loans if they were using their own funds. By law, the banks had to report their rates to monetary authorities and could fix rates within two points of the announced rate.\n\nIn 1991 commercial banks pressured the government to reduce their 35 percent minimum reserve ratio. This rate remained standard until June 1993 when the minimum requirement was temporarily lifted to 42 percent. The rate was dropped to 36 percent three months later. The banks had excess reserves, and lending rates were in the area of 26 to 29 percent, with few borrowers. Prior to liberalization measures, the [[Central Bank of Honduras]] (Banco Central de Honduras) maintained interest rate controls, setting a 19 percent ceiling, with the market lending rate hovering around 26 percent in late 1991. With inflation hitting 33 percent in 1990, there was, in fact, a negative real interest rate, but this situation reversed in 1991 when rates were high relative to inflation. Rates of 35 to 43 percent in 1993 were well above the inflation rate of 13 to 14 percent. Bankers argued for further liberalization, including easing of controls in the housing and nonexport agricultural sectors.\n\nA Honduran stock exchange was established in August 1990 with transactions confined to trading debt. Nine companies were registered with the exchange in 1991; in 1993 this number had grown to eighteen. It appears doubtful, however, that the market will develop fully, given the reluctance of family-held firms to open their books to public scrutiny.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{main|Tourism in Honduras}}\nForeign tourists are attracted to Honduras by the Mayan ruins in [[Cop\u00e1n]] and coral reef skin-diving off the [[Islas de la Bah\u00eda]] (Bay Islands). Poor infrastructure, however, has discouraged the development of substantial international tourism. Despite these problems, the number of visitors arriving in Honduras rose from fewer than 200,000 in 1987 to almost 250,000 in 1989. Small [[ecotourism]] projects, in particular, are considered to have significant potential.\n\n==Trade==\n[[File:Honduras Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|450px|A proportional representation of Honduras' exports.]]\n\nIn the early 1990s, the United States was by far Honduras's leading trading partner, with Japan a distant second. United States exports to Honduras in 1992 were valued at US$533&nbsp;million, about 54 percent of the country's total imports of $983&nbsp;million. Most of the rest of Honduras's imports come from its Central American neighbors. Despite its status as a beneficiary of both the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) and the [[Generalized System of Preferences]] (GSP)--both of which confer duty-free status on Honduran imports to the United States\u2014Honduras has run a long-standing trade deficit with the United States.\n\nTotal exports of goods and services by Honduras in 1992 was $843&nbsp;million, of which about 52 percent went to the United States. The current amount exported by Honduras as of 2017 is $8.675 billion (USD$), with 34.5% of the said exports now going to the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/attachments/summaries/HO-summary.pdf|title=One Page Country Summary of Honduras|last=|first=|date=February 2019|website=CIA World Factbook|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/|archive-date=2019|access-date=September 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Linkages to the United States===\nAs with most Latin American countries, Honduras's economy is closely tied to the US. The US is Honduras's primary trading partner and the source of about two-thirds of the country's [[foreign direct investment]].\nUS [[Transnational corporation|multinationals]] [[Dole Food Company]] and [[Chiquita]] control a large portion of Honduras's agricultural exports. Presently, Honduras participates alongside the [[Rainforest Alliance]] for the exporting of agricultural goods to the US.\n\nHondurans working in the US send more than $2&nbsp;billion each year to their families in Honduras; these remittances account for 28.2% of Honduras's GDP (2007 information\n<ref>NotiCen, 29 November 2007, excerpted in University of California at San Diego libraries [http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/honduras/19982007.html Latin american election statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717061207/http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/resources/featured-collections/latin-american-elections-statistics/honduras/19982007.html |date=17 July 2009 }}. Retrieved July 2009. NotiCen's source is probably the Latin American Development Bank.</ref>).\n\n==Foreign investment==\n\nWith the exception of relatively recent, Asian-dominated investment in assembly firms along Honduras's northern coast, the country remains heavily dependent on United States-based multinational corporations for most of its investment needs in the early 1990s. Overall investment as a percentage of GDP declined dramatically during the 1980s, from about 25 percent in 1980 to a meager 15 percent in 1990. Dole Food Company and Chiquita Brands International together have invested heavily in Honduran industries as diverse as breweries and plastics, cement, soap, cans, and shoes.\n\nAs Honduras enters the 1990s, it faces challenging economic problems. The solutions relied on in the past\u2014traditional export crops, the maquiladora assembly industry, and the 1980s' development schemes\u2014appear unlikely to provide enough new jobs for a rapidly growing population. The major economic challenge for Honduras over the next decade will be to find dependable sources of sustainable economic growth.\n\n==Statistics==\n\n*GDP\n** L 233&nbsp;billion (2007.)\n** US$12.3&nbsp;billion (2007.)\n** International dollars (purchasing power parity method) $24.69&nbsp;billion (2007 est.)<ref>L and US$ data are from [http://data.un.org United Nations data], National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates.
