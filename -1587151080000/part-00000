Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role. Born in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque]] with a [[primordial dwarfism]] condition, dela Cruz started exercising and studied [[karate]]. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by film producers Peter and Cora Caballes of Liliw Productions, and got the pseudonym Weng Weng. Following this, dela Cruz played supporting roles in films, and shared his first top billing with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa'' (1978). Dela Cruz's first lead in the [[action film]] [[Parody film|spoof]] ''Agent OO'' (1981) was followed by two sequels. It became dela Cruz's most well known role, where he demonstrated skills in stunts and martial arts. \n\n''Agent OO's'' sequel ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) that launched dela Cruz to brief but international stardom but also made him a unique figure in [[Cinematography|cinema]]. After it's local release, first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] organised a lavish film festival in the hope to present Filipino films to foreign [[Film distributor|distributor]]. At the high profile event, ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales, while dela Cruz was the mediatic center of attention and the breakthrough star. \n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more films ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. Eventually Peter and Cora Caballes changed professional paths and dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry. Dela Cruz spent the rest of his life with his family in Baclaran and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nWith the passing of time, dela Cruz became a cult film icon. Online, some of his movies and clips of them went viral. By the 2000s, a lot of information published about him was unclear or hyperbolic mythos, some with accounts that support them. Research about his life led to the making of two successful documentaries ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013).\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor. By 1968, dela Cruz's father passed away due to falling down a ladder at work<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/145619/weng-weng-lives/|title=Weng Weng Lives!|date=2014-01-04|website=Inquirer Lifestyle|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/arts-and-entertainment/weng-weng-a1707-20170425-lfrm|title=The Larger-Than-Life Story of Weng Weng|work=Esquiremag.ph|access-date=2018-08-25}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite AV media |last= Leavold|first= Andrew|date= |title= ''The Search for Weng Weng''| |language= English|type=DVD |location= USA|publisher= Wild Eye Releasing|id= 760137943594}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Celing, as a child dela Cruz was fascinated with action films and started to study them. Neighbours of the dela Cruz started to notice him climbing on clothing lines doing acrobacies and pull ups. Dela Cruz joined [[Karate]] classes, where he learnt quickly, and impressed his instructor. So much so that the instructor would have demonstrations with dela Cruz to promote the school. During one of these demonstration dela Cruz was noticed by producer and actor Peter Caballes of Liliw Productions. Dela Cruz's mother who had a hard time raising five boys, accepted that Peter his wife Cora Ridon Caballes would take dela Cruz under their helm for a film career.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 1975 to 1981: Early roles and breakthrough ===\nDela Cruz started to work almost exclusively with Liliw Productions, starting with an uncredited role, ''Silakbo'', released October 17, 1975.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=229}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, dela Cruz billed as Weng Weng, which would be his pseudonym for the rest of his career, acted in ''Silang Matatapang'' and ''Sila...Sa Bawat Bangketa.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=229}}</ref>''\n\nIn 1978, dela Cruz shared the top billing with actor [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=230-231}}</ref>\n\nAccording to local comic star Rodolfo Vera Quizon Sr., better known as [[Dolphy]], he was introduced to dela Cruz through his friend Peter Caballes, who felt he would be an asset in a [[comedy film]].

As well as taking care of dela Cruz's training for the rest of his career, Nicart also expanded his training in karate and acting.

Actors [[Rez Cortez]] and [[Roland Dantes]] also asserted that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality. Cortez who acted in two film with dela Cruz said that he had trouble getting in touch with his emotions in order to express them. Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. Catral said she never noticed dela Cruz's childlike personality. She felt he had a good grip of what was going on and had adult conversations with him, but had an odd sense of humor, and thinks it is probably what led others to believe he was slow.<ref name=\":5\" />  Actor Nelson Anderson described him as complex adult, with an unexplored side to his talent.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=180-181}}</ref>\n\nProducer Peter and Cora Caballes were married when they discovered dela Cruz. During dela Cruz's prime, their account was that they adopted him ten years prior to the release of ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) to help him. In 1982 they released their last film with dela Cruz. According to both Nicart and film distributor John Kater, the couple separated. Peter left Manilla and Cora ran successfully as a [[City council|city councilor]]. \n\nCeling denies Peter and Cora Caballes's account on his adoption and said they just borrowed dela Cruz when needed, as if he would go on a holiday with them. Celing describes the couple as civil when visiting, but only dealt with their mother on business issues and promised her a house. Celing added that they never provided it or fully pay his brother, they abandoned him when they had a career change, and completely absent when dela Cruz became paralyzed. At dela Cruz's funeral Celing said that Peter paid for the casket paid and sent a minor amount of cash, while Cora paid for the service once visited by another of their brother.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nOn dela Cruz's work conditions, Rez Cortez, Nelson Anderson, Roland Dantes, Franco Guerrero, Rusty Santos, and Eddie Nicard found the financial treatment of dela Cruz appalling. For dela Cruz, Nicart said the Caballes provided shelter, care, travelled the world, while under paid at $ 500 per films with a per diem. Nicart said the Caballes were wealthy and treated dela Cruz like a dog. They would be friendly to him, but would ask him to leave the room in any business meeting or when inconvenient. On that matter Anderson felt that dela Cruz was treated like puppet by everyone and the Caballes were too possessive not allowing him to grow and think for himself.<ref name=\":6\" /> Cortez said, while working on the first film where dela Cruz received the top billing, he suspected that dela Cruz wasn't well compensated. Cortez knew dela Cruz's producers took care of his basic needs, but found it strange when he saw dela Cruz arrive on set in a utility vehicle and not his private car. While feeling dela Cruz deserved a better compensation, Cortez concluded that he was probably happy, considering where he came from and to get a great deal of life experiences. Film editor Edgardo \"Boy\" Vinarao, said that from his point of view dela Cruz was treated like a little prince.<ref name=\":0\" /> According to the filmmakers of the documentary ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]],'' when they tracked down the couple to get their account, Peter had passed away in 2007 while Cora never responded on the matter.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=205-217|chapter=The search continues}}</ref>\n\nOn dela Cruz's work ethic, director Nicart, a former actor and stuntman, had doubt on dela Cruz leading a film due to his limitations and also his inability to read a script. Prior to the shoot of their first film ''Agent OO'' (1981) and for the rest of dela Cruz's career Nicart trained him with the stunt company SOS Daredevils. To further dela Cruz's abilities, they gave him acting, karate, fight choreography, and stunts lessons. Nicart found him to be so collaborative and fearless, having never refused any stunt, that soon enough he sensed that dela Cruz would become famous. On dela Cruz's talent, [[Dolphy]] praised his sense of humor and physical skills, while Guerrero thinks highly of his acting abilities.\n\nDela Cruz had several friendships throughout his career. Guerrero describes that the first time he met dela Cruz children were around and did not know what to make him, and when he spoke the little girls got scared. From that point on they became friends and dela Cruz would always make him laugh. A fond memory he holds, is that dela Cruz often taunted him to go sparring, where he would pretend to be way too scared to go along.<ref name=\":0\" /> Anderson's account of the of his friendship with dela Cruz was at time when both were under contract with Liliw Production. Which he describes as being polluted by the possessive attitude of producers Peter and Cora Caballes. When he started socializing with dela Cruz, he noticed the his potential and felt he was put down by others. Anderson wanting to be prudent, said de la Cruz was upset at the idea of wearing a belt and a helmet while riding with him on his motorcycle. Also, a man once tapped his hand on his head, provoked dela Cruz was ready to fight and wasn't afraid of his size, and Anderson had to separate them. He also recalls bringing dela Cruz at an [[Art film|Art house]] cinema named Mabini to introduce him to [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1950), [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Dela Cruz was particularly fond of [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), according to Anderson, on his first viewing dela Cruz cried. They agreed to make an action comedy remake with a human touch. As soon as Anderson started voicing his concerns regarding both dangerous working conditions and mispayments to the Caballes, they separated them. They would tell him that dela Cruz was absent when he wasn't. Anderson parted ways with the company, never to see him again.<ref name=\":6\" /> Catral stated she had affection for dela Cruz, as well as the only individual worthwhile  to hang out with inset, and when she stopped acting to finish her studies she only said goodbye to dela Cruz and [[Dolphy]].<ref name=\":5\" /> Celing said that fellow actress [[Lotis Key]] attended dela Cruz's funeral.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=201-202|chapter=The death of the Pinoy action king}}</ref>\n\nDela Cruz became friends with president [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand Marco]] and his [[Marcos family|family]], and on several occasions he joined their company. President Marcos gave dela Cruz several honors during his career. According to director Dante Pangilinan it was due to Cora Caballes being the niece of General Prospero Olivas. They brought him to the Marcos palace where according to Marcos' daughter [[Imee Marcos|Imee]] the whole family fell in love with him because of dela Cruz's personal sense of humor was infectious. She went on to say that it was with her brother [[Bongbong Marcos|Bongbong]] with whom dela Cruz was the closest. Former first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] said the following about dela Cruz: The appearance of Weng Weng showed the great Filipino spirit. They can make a hero of a disabled, distorted guy. So everybody had a chance. They have such a democratic attitude. The Filipino have no prejudice. He entertained us. He was distorted but he could make us laugh and make us happy.

Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role. Born in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque]] with a [[primordial dwarfism]] condition, dela Cruz started exercising and studied [[karate]]. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by film producers Peter and Cora Caballes of Liliw Productions, and got the pseudonym Weng Weng. Following this, dela Cruz played supporting roles in films, and shared his first top billing with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa'' (1978). Dela Cruz's first lead in the [[action film]] [[Parody film|spoof]] ''Agent OO'' (1981) was followed by two sequels. It became dela Cruz's most well known role, where he demonstrated skills in stunts and martial arts. \n\n''Agent OO's'' sequel ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) that launched dela Cruz to brief but international stardom but also made him a unique figure in [[Cinematography|cinema]]. After it's local release, first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] organised a lavish film festival in the hope to present Filipino films to foreign [[Film distributor|distributor]]. At the high profile event, ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales, while dela Cruz was the mediatic center of attention and the breakthrough star. \n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more films ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. Eventually Peter and Cora Caballes changed professional paths and dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry. Dela Cruz spent the rest of his life with his family in Baclaran and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nWith the passing of time, dela Cruz became a cult film icon. Online, some of his movies and clips of them went viral. By the 2000s, a lot of information published about him was unclear or hyperbolic mythos, some with accounts that support them. Research about his life led to the making of two successful documentaries [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and Andrew Leavold's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013).\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor. By 1968, dela Cruz's father passed away due to falling down a ladder at work<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/145619/weng-weng-lives/|title=Weng Weng Lives!|date=2014-01-04|website=Inquirer Lifestyle|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/arts-and-entertainment/weng-weng-a1707-20170425-lfrm|title=The Larger-Than-Life Story of Weng Weng|work=Esquiremag.ph|access-date=2018-08-25}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite AV media |last= Leavold|first= Andrew|date= |title= ''The Search for Weng Weng''| |language= English|type=DVD |location= USA|publisher= Wild Eye Releasing|id= 760137943594}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Celing, as a child dela Cruz was fascinated with action films and started to study them. Neighbours of the dela Cruz started to notice him climbing on clothing lines doing acrobacies and pull ups. Dela Cruz joined [[Karate]] classes, where he learnt quickly, and impressed his instructor. So much so that the instructor would have demonstrations with dela Cruz to promote the school. During one of these demonstration dela Cruz was noticed by producer and actor Peter Caballes of Liliw Productions.

As well as taking care of dela Cruz's training for the rest of his career, Nicart also expanded his training in karate and acting. Nicart doubted dela Cruz's suitability for the role due to his intellectual and physical limitations, but changed his mind when he realized how collaborative he could be, and how his bravery allowed him never to refuse a stunt.<ref name=\":0\" /> On June 12, ''Da Best In Da West'' was released with Dolphy starring and dela Cruz in a minor role.

Dela Cruz was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. The official cause is heart attack due to hypertension.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Personal ==\nCeling and Filipino actor Franco Guerrero said that dela Cruz never had any romantic relationships. Guerrero said that dela Cruz said he would brag about sexual exploit but never saw his actual girlfriends. Director Dante Pangilinan said that dela Cruz had his first kiss on the set of ''Sila... Sa bawat bangketa'' (1977) after he asked him if he could get an onscreen kiss. When he said yes, dela Cruz was both delighted and nervous. Yehlen Catral, who played the damsel-in-distress in a dela Cruz film, said she helped him introduce himself to women.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=219-239|chapter=An interview with Yehlen Catral}}</ref> According to director Eddie Nicart if dela Cruz would get free from the set, he would immediately go where there is drinks and women, and would consistently ask their whereabouts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCeling and Nicart said while dela Cruz had a good grasp of what was going around him, but was mentally slow. Guerrero described that dela Cruz had the mind of a ten-year-old and said that dela Cruz believed anything he said, whether it was real or imaginary. Actors [[Rez Cortez]] and [[Roland Dantes]] also asserted that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality. Cortez who acted in two film with dela Cruz said that he had trouble getting in touch with his emotions in order to express them. Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. Catral said she never noticed dela Cruz's childlike personality. She felt he had a good grip of what was going on and had adult conversations with him, but had an odd sense of humor, and thinks it is probably what led others to believe he was slow.<ref name=\":5\" />  Actor Nelson Anderson described him as complex adult, with an unexplored side to his talent.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=180-181}}</ref>\n\nProducer Peter and Cora Caballes were married when they discovered dela Cruz. During dela Cruz's prime, their account was that they adopted him ten years prior to the release of ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) to help him. In 1982 they released their last film with dela Cruz. According to both Nicart and film distributor John Kater, the couple separated. Peter left Manilla and Cora ran successfully as a [[City council|city councilor]]. \n\nCeling denies Peter and Cora Caballes's account on his adoption and said they just borrowed dela Cruz when needed, as if he would go on a holiday with them. Celing describes the couple as civil when visiting, but only dealt with their mother on business issues and promised her a house. Celing added that they never provided it or fully pay his brother, they abandoned him when they had a career change, and completely absent when dela Cruz became paralyzed. At dela Cruz's funeral Celing said that Peter paid for the casket paid and sent a minor amount of cash, while Cora paid for the service once visited by another of their brother.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nOn dela Cruz's work conditions, Rez Cortez, Nelson Anderson, Roland Dantes, Franco Guerrero, Rusty Santos, and Eddie Nicard found the financial treatment of dela Cruz appalling. For dela Cruz, Nicart said the Caballes provided shelter, care, travelled the world, while under paid at $ 500 per films with a per diem. Nicart said the Caballes were wealthy and treated dela Cruz like a dog. They would be friendly to him, but would ask him to leave the room in any business meeting or when inconvenient. On that matter Anderson felt that dela Cruz was treated like puppet by everyone and the Caballes were too possessive not allowing him to grow and think for himself.<ref name=\":6\" /> Cortez said, while working on the first film where dela Cruz received the top billing, he suspected that dela Cruz wasn't well compensated. Cortez knew dela Cruz's producers took care of his basic needs, but found it strange when he saw dela Cruz arrive on set in a utility vehicle and not his private car. While feeling dela Cruz deserved a better compensation, Cortez concluded that he was probably happy, considering where he came from and to get a great deal of life experiences. Film editor Edgardo \"Boy\" Vinarao, said that from his point of view dela Cruz was treated like a little prince.<ref name=\":0\" /> According to the filmmakers of the documentary ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]],'' when they tracked down the couple to get their account, Peter had passed away in 2007 while Cora never responded on the matter.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=205-217|chapter=The search continues}}</ref>\n\nOn dela Cruz's work ethic, director Nicart, a former actor and stuntman, had doubt on dela Cruz leading a film due to his limitations and also his inability to read a script. Prior to the shoot of their first film ''Agent OO'' (1981) and for the rest of dela Cruz's career Nicart trained him with the stunt company SOS Daredevils. To further dela Cruz's abilities, they gave him acting, karate, fight choreography, and stunts lessons. Nicart found him to be so collaborative and fearless, having never refused any stunt, that soon enough he sensed that dela Cruz would become famous. On dela Cruz's talent, [[Dolphy]] praised his sense of humor and physical skills, while Guerrero thinks highly of his acting abilities.\n\nDela Cruz had several friendships throughout his career. Guerrero describes that the first time he met dela Cruz children were around and did not know what to make him, and when he spoke the little girls got scared. From that point on they became friends and dela Cruz would always make him laugh. A fond memory he holds, is that dela Cruz often taunted him to go sparring, where he would pretend to be way too scared to go along.<ref name=\":0\" /> Anderson's account of the of his friendship with dela Cruz was at time when both were under contract with Liliw Production. Which he describes as being polluted by the possessive attitude of producers Peter and Cora Caballes. When he started socializing with dela Cruz, he noticed the his potential and felt he was put down by others. Anderson wanting to be prudent, said de la Cruz was upset at the idea of wearing a belt and a helmet while riding with him on his motorcycle.

Criticism is dominated by the use of the term \"intelligent\" in the genre name, and also often calls attention to the fact that artists working under this name often produce music that is not easy to dance to.\n\n''Allmusic Guide'' describes the IDM name as<blockquote>A loaded term meant to distinguish electronic music of the '90s and later that's equally comfortable on the dancefloor as in the living room, IDM (Intelligent Dance Music) eventually acquired a good deal of negative publicity, not least among the legion of dance producers and fans whose exclusion from the community prompted the question of whether they produced \"Stupid\" dance music.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/idm-ma0000004477 IDM page at [[AllMusic]]]</ref></blockquote> In a September 1997 interview, Aphex Twin commented on the 'Intelligent Dance Music' label:\n<blockquote>I just think it's really funny to have terms like that. It's basically saying 'this is intelligent and everything else is stupid.' It's really nasty to everyone else's music. (laughs) It makes me laugh, things like that. I don't use names. I just say that I like something or I don't.<ref>[http://www.furious.com/perfect/aphextwin.html Aphex Twin interview, September, 1997]</ref></blockquote>\nAphex Twin's Rephlex records official overarching genre name is '''Braindance''', of which Dave Segal of Stylus Magazine asked whether it was a \"snide dig at IDM\u2019s mockworthy Intelligent Dance Music tag?\"<ref>''Rephlexions!: A Braindance Compilation'', 20 November 2003, Dave Segal, Stylus Magazine, [http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/various-artists/rephlexions-a-braindance-compilation.htm]</ref>\n\n[[Kid 606]] has said,<blockquote>It's a label invented by PR companies who need catchphrases.

Paradinas has stated that the term IDM was only used in North America. Criticism is dominated by the use of the term \"intelligent\" in the genre name, and also often calls attention to the fact that artists working under this name often produce music that is not easy to dance to.\n\n''Allmusic Guide'' describes the IDM name as<blockquote>A loaded term meant to distinguish electronic music of the '90s and later that's equally comfortable on the dancefloor as in the living room, IDM (Intelligent Dance Music) eventually acquired a good deal of negative publicity, not least among the legion of dance producers and fans whose exclusion from the community prompted the question of whether they produced \"Stupid\" dance music.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/idm-ma0000004477 IDM page at [[AllMusic]]]</ref></blockquote> In a September 1997 interview, Aphex Twin commented on the 'Intelligent Dance Music' label:\n<blockquote>I just think it's really funny to have terms like that. It's basically saying 'this is intelligent and everything else is stupid.' It's really nasty to everyone else's music. (laughs) It makes me laugh, things like that. I don't use names. I just say that I like something or I don't.<ref>[http://www.furious.com/perfect/aphextwin.html Aphex Twin interview, September, 1997]</ref></blockquote>\nAphex Twin's Rephlex records official overarching genre name is '''Braindance''', of which Dave Segal of Stylus Magazine asked whether it was a \"snide dig at IDM\u2019s mockworthy Intelligent Dance Music tag?\"<ref>''Rephlexions!: A Braindance Compilation'', 20 November 2003, Dave Segal, Stylus Magazine, [http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/various-artists/rephlexions-a-braindance-compilation.htm]</ref>\n\n[[Kid 606]] has said,<blockquote>It's a label invented by PR companies who need catchphrases.

Matmos is IDM if that only means \"might be talked about on the IDM list\"- but I don't endorse that term \"intelligent dance music\" because it's laughable.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}</blockquote>\n\nIn a 2016 interview with [[Resident Advisor]], Sean Booth of [[Autechre]] said that, <blockquote>All these things about us being \"intelligent\" and the term \"IDM\" are just silly. I'm not a particularly intelligent person, me. I'm diligent, I'm pretty hardworking, but I'm not that clever. I ain't got any qualifications, I just pick up stuff that I think is interesting at the time...There was also the \"[[Artificial Intelligence (series)|Artificial Intelligence]]\" tag that Warp coined, but to me as a listener that never seemed to be saying \"this is more intelligent.\" It was just a signifier of it being sci-fi music...Thing is, almost all the artists on that first AI compilation are just like us, they were regular kids, they're not intelligent people particularly.

SP Jairaj Rawal arrested her husband Ajay Puri for investigation. Ajay Puri who is the owner of a lab and worked under Maya seemed to have committed something wrong along with his girlfriend Ritu.\n\nSP Jairaj suspects Ajay and makes him stay in the morgue until Maya's corpse is found. Strange incidents start to happen with Ajay. He feels Maya's presence around him and gradually gets clues including the bottle of cardiotoxin (TH-16) which he used for making Maya have a heart attack and also gets a phone in another corpse's bag having the calls only from Maya. All these events makes him believe that Maya is still alive and playing a game with him to take her revenge.\n\nIn a flashback, it is shown that Maya always used to dominate Ajay with her money and power. Ajay's possessiveness and his affair with Ritu made him kill Maya and gave it a look of a heart attack by using a cardiotoxin which takes about 8 hours to work. In the morgue, Ajay continuously keeps contact with Ritu and they find out that Maya knew about their relationship by hiring a private detective named Tony d'Cousta. Ajay tells Ritu to run away to a safe place as he felt that Maya is after her. When Ajay fails to contact Ritu, he confesses everything to SP Jairaj out of fear and requests him to save Ritu from Maya. In the meantime, SP Jairaj gets a call from his team that they have found a female corpse which is revealed to be Maya's. When SP orders the police to arrest Ajay, he tries to run away but falls down due to chestpain.\n\nFinally it is revealed that Ritu is none other than SP Jairaj's daughter with the actual name, Isha. Everything that has happened with Maya and Ajay from the last night was their plan.

SP Jairaj Rawal arrested her husband Ajay Puri for investigation. Ajay Puri who is the owner of a lab and worked under Maya seemed to have committed something wrong along with his girlfriend Ritu.\n\nSP Jairaj suspects Ajay and makes him stay in the morgue untill Maya's corpse is found. Strange incidents start to happen with Ajay. He feels Maya's presence around him and gradually gets clues including the bottle of cardiotoxin (TH-16) which he used for making Maya have a heart attack and also gets a phone in another corpse's bag having the calls only from Maya. All these events makes him believe that Maya is still alive and playing a game with him to take her revenge.\n\nIn a flashback, it is shown that Maya always used to dominate Ajay with her money and power. Ajay's possessiveness and his affair with Ritu made him kill Maya and gave it a look of a heart attack by using a cardiotoxin which takes about 8 hours to work. In the morgue, Ajay continuously keeps contact with Ritu and they find out that Maya knew about their relationship by hiring a private detective named Tony d'Cousta. Ajay tells Ritu to run away to a safe place as he felt that Maya is after her. When Ajay fails to contact Ritu, he confesses everything to SP Jairaj out of fear and requests him to save Ritu from Maya. In the meantime, SP Jairaj gets a call from his team that they have found a female corpse which is revealed to be Maya's. When SP orders the police to arrest Ajay, he tries to run away but falls down due to chestpain.\n\nFinally it is revealed that Ritu is none other than SP Jairaj's daughter with the actual name, Isha. Everything that has happened with Maya and Ajay from the last night was their plan. Yet again in a flashback, it is shown that SP Jairaj's wife, Nancy, died in a car accident which was done by a druken Maya and Ajay and instead of helping them, they return to the crime scene and hit the car again as Ajay noticed that the little girl sitting on back seat has seen them.
