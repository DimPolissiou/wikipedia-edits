The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed.  Whenever the local forests die back, due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bell miner (''Manorina melanophrys'') belongs to the family of [[honeyeater]]s and Australian chats ([[Meliphagidae]]), which is part of the superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]] that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills ([[Acanthizidae]]); bristlebirds ([[Dasyornithidae]]); fairy-wrens ([[Maluridae]]); and pardalotes ([[Pardalotidae]]).<ref name=\"Phylogeny\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Trueman|first2=John W.H.|last3=Ebert|first3=Daniel|last4=Joseph|first4=Leo|last5=Magrath|first5=Robert D.|title=Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=June 2010|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1087\u20131102|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005|pmid=20152917}}</ref>\nBell miners share the genus ''[[Manorina]]'' with three other endemic Australian miners: the [[noisy miner]] (''M. melanocephala''), the [[yellow-throated miner]] (''M. flavigula''), and the endangered [[black-eared miner]] (''M. melanotis''). The three other miners were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'', which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to ''[[Manorina]]'' has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain ''[[Melidectes]]'' honeyeaters.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed.  Whenever the local forests die back, due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bell miner (''Manorina melanophrys'') belongs to the family of [[honeyeater]]s and Australian chats ([[Meliphagidae]]), which is part of the superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]] that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills ([[Acanthizidae]]); bristlebirds ([[Dasyornithidae]]); fairy-wrens ([[Maluridae]]); and pardalotes ([[Pardalotidae]]).<ref name=\"Phylogeny\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Trueman|first2=John W.H.|last3=Ebert|first3=Daniel|last4=Joseph|first4=Leo|last5=Magrath|first5=Robert D.|title=Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=June 2010|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1087\u20131102|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005|pmid=20152917}}</ref>\nBell miners share the genus ''[[Manorina]]'' with three other endemic Australian miners: the [[noisy miner]] (''M. melanocephala''), the [[yellow-throated miner]] (''M. flavigula''), and the endangered [[black-eared miner]] (''M. melanotis''). The three other miners were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'', which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to ''[[Manorina]]'' has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain ''[[Melidectes]]'' honeyeaters.

One female was recorded nesting five times in one season, though that many nest attempts is unusual.<ref name=\"SocialOrganization\" /> Bell miner pairs are monogamous, but the breeding tasks are divided between the sexes.

of cryptography]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|current restrictions on the import of cryptographic tools|restrictions on exporting cryptographic tools|Export of cryptography}}\n{{Update|date=December 2015}}\n\nA number of countries have attempted to restrict the import of [[cryptography]] tools.\n\n==Rationale==\nCountries may wish to restrict import of cryptography technologies for a number of reasons:\n* Imported cryptography may have [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]] or security holes (e.g. the [[FREAK|FREAK vulnerability]]), intentional or not, which allow the country or group who created the backdoor technology, for example the [[National Security Agency|National Security Agency (NSA)]], to spy on persons using the imported cryptography; therefore the use of cryptography is restricted to that which the government thinks is safe, or which it develops itself.\n* Citizens can anonymously communicate with each other, preventing any external party from monitoring them.\n* Encrypted transactions may impede external entities to control the conducting of business.\n* Cryptography may sometimes increase levels of privacy within the country beyond what the government wishes.\n\n==Status by country==\nThe [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] and Global Internet Liberty Campaign reports use a color code to indicate the level of restriction, with the following meanings:\n* '''Green''': No restriction\n* '''Yellow''': License required for importation\n* '''Red''': Total ban\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
