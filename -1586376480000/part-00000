It also won the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], and Mendes won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn April 6, 1917, [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War I|aerial reconnaissance]] has observed that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], which has pulled back from a sector of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in northern [[French Third Republic|France]], is not in retreat but has made a strategic withdrawal to the new [[Hindenburg Line]], where they are waiting to overwhelm the British with [[artillery]]. In the British trenches, with [[field telephone]] lines cut, two young British soldiers, [[Lance Corporal]]s William Schofield, a veteran of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment]], calling off a scheduled attack that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother [[Lieutenant]] Joseph Blake.\n\nSchofield and Blake cross [[no man's land]] to reach the abandoned German [[Trench warfare|trenches]]. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire, which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where a [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|German plane]] is shot down in a [[dogfight]] with Allied [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]]. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot, but the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and [[dog tag]], as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit.\n\nA destroyed canal bridge near [[\u00c9coust-Saint-Mein]] prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and comes under fire from a German [[sniper]]. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked out. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He encounters another German soldier, and escapes into an abandoned building, where he stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her and the infant his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite the woman's pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock that it is morning and time is running out. After encountering more German soldiers, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.\n\nRealising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the open battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield then finds Joseph, who was among the first wave but is unscathed. Schofield tells Joseph of his mission, and that his brother is dead, giving Blake's rings and dog tag to Joseph. Joseph is distressed about his brother, but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to their mother about Tom's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Lance Corporal William \"Will\"

She adds that the \"false heroics and filmmaking feats of wonder\" serve to provide an \"escape from the true carnage of the 'Great War'\", and that in reality the scale of the [[World War I casualties|casualties]] was such that the potential loss of 1,600 men would not have excited the response portrayed in the film.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/08/opinion/1917-movie-world-war-I.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 February 2020|first=Cathy|last=Tempelsman|accessdate=11 February 2020|title='1917' Turns a Horrific War Into an Uplifting Hero's Journey}}</ref>\n\nAccording to military historian Jeremy Banning, \"It made no sense, as the film depicts, to have some battalions nine miles beyond the former German line and others seemingly unaware of whether this line was manned. ...

The [[Devonshire Regiment]] was never brigaded with any West Indian or African units (it spent the war in [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Division]]). Over 15,000 men from the Caribbean enlisted, including black Caribbeans living in Britain, and by 1915 it was decided to group them together into a single regiment, named the [[British West Indies Regiment]].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news |title=Fact-checking 1917: how historically accurate is Sam Mendes's First World War film? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/1917-fact-checking-how-historically-accurate-sam-mendes-war-movie/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-6RACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA97 |title=Colonial Soldiers in Europe, 1914\u20131945: \"Aliens in Uniform\" in Wartime Societies |pages=97\u2013102|date=22 December 2015|website=|isbn=9781317330981|last1=Storm |first1=Eric |last2=Tuma |first2=Ali Al }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How accurate is Sam Mendes's film, 1917? |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-accurate-is-sam-mendess-film-1917-8mtbrbfkv |work=The Times |date=6 January 2020}}</ref> Indian [[Sikhs]] would have served in their own regiments as part of the [[British Indian Army]], not as individuals in the ranks of British regiments and Corps.

It also won the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], and Mendes won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn April 6, 1917, [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War I|aerial reconnaissance]] has observed that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], which has pulled back from a sector of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in northern [[French Third Republic|France]], is not in retreat but has made a strategic withdrawal to the new [[Hindenburg Line]], where they are waiting to overwhelm the British with [[artillery]]. In the British trenches, with [[field telephone]] lines cut, two young British soldiers, [[Lance Corporal]]s William Schofield, a veteran of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment]], calling off a scheduled attack that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother [[Lieutenant]] Joseph Blake.\n\nSchofield and Blake cross [[no man's land]] to reach the abandoned German [[Trench warfare|trenches]]. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire, which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where a [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|German plane]] is shot down in a [[dogfight]] with Allied [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]]. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot, but the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and [[dog tag]], as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit.\n\nA destroyed canal bridge near [[\u00c9coust-Saint-Mein]] prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and comes under fire from a German [[sniper]]. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked out. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He encounters another German soldier, and escapes into an abandoned building, where he stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her and the infant his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite the woman's pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock that it is morning and time is running out. After encountering more German soldiers, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.\n\nRealising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the open battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield then finds Joseph, who was among the first wave but is unscathed. Schofield tells Joseph of his mission, and that his brother is dead, giving Joseph Blake's rings and dog tag. Joseph is distressed about his brother, but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to their mother about Blake's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Lance Corporal William \"Will\"

In reality, the number of black soldiers serving in the [[British Army during World War I|British Army]] (rather than [[Colonial troops|colonial regiments]]) during World War I is unknown but is likely to have been negligible. The [[Devonshire Regiment]] was never brigaded with any West Indian or African units (it spent the war in [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Division]]). Over 15,000 men from the Caribbean enlisted, including black Caribbeans living in Britain, and by 1915 it was decided to group them together into a single regiment, named the [[British West Indies Regiment]].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news |title=Fact-checking 1917: how historically accurate is Sam Mendes's First World War film? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/1917-fact-checking-how-historically-accurate-sam-mendes-war-movie/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-6RACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA97 |title=Colonial Soldiers in Europe, 1914\u20131945: \"Aliens in Uniform\" in Wartime Societies |pages=97\u2013102|date=22 December 2015|website=|isbn=9781317330981|last1=Storm |first1=Eric |last2=Tuma |first2=Ali Al }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How accurate is Sam Mendes's film, 1917? |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-accurate-is-sam-mendess-film-1917-8mtbrbfkv |work=The Times |date=6 January 2020}}</ref> Indian [[Sikhs]] would have served in their own regiments as part of the [[British Indian Army]], not as individuals in the ranks of British regiments and Corps.

Archaeologists working from the last half of the 19th century discovered continuous traces of human settlements in areas situated in Bra\u0219ov: Valea Cet\u0103\u021bii, Pietrele lui Solomon, \u0218prenghi, T\u00e2mpa, Dealul Melcilor, and Noua. The first three locations show traces of [[Dacians|Dacian]] citadels; \u0218prenghi Hill housed a [[Roman Dacia|Roman]]-style construction. The last two locations had their names applied to [[Bronze Age]] cultures \u2014 ''[[Schneckenberg culture|Schneckenberg]]'' (\"Hill of the Snails\"; Early Bronze Age){{sfn| Coles| Harding | 1979|p=140}} and ''[[Noua culture|Noua]]'' (\"The New\"; Late Bronze Age).{{sfn| Coles| Harding | 1979|p=410}}\n\n[[Transylvanian Saxons]] played a decisive role in Bra\u0219ov's development and were invited by [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] kings to develop towns, build mines, and cultivate the land of [[Transylvania]] at different stages between 1141 and 1300. The settlers came primarily from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and the [[Moselle]] region, with others from [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Wallonia]] and even [[France]].\n\nIn 1211, by order of King [[Andrew II of Hungary]], the [[Teutonic Knights]] fortified the [[Burzenland]] to defend the border of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. On the site of the village of Bra\u0219ov, the Teutonic Knights built Kronstadt \u2013 'the City of the Crown'.<ref>Mediaeval studies, Volumes 17-18, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1955, Toronto, Canada, An annual journal of scholarship, History, {{ISSN|0076-5872}}</ref> Although the crusaders were evicted by 1225, the colonists they brought in long ago remained, along with local population in three distinct settlements they founded on the site of Bra\u0219ov:\n*''Corona'', around the Black Church (Biserica Neagr\u0103);\n*''Martinsberg'', west of Cet\u0103\u021buia Hill;\n*''Bartholom\u00e4'', on the eastern side of Sprenghi Hill.\n[[File:Brasov 1689.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the walled city prior to the 1689 fire]]\nGermans living in Bra\u0219ov were mainly involved in trade and crafts. The location of the city at the intersection of trade routes linking the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Western Europe]], together with certain tax exemptions, allowed Saxon merchants to obtain considerable wealth and exert a strong political influence. They contributed a great deal to the architectural flavor of the city. Fortifications around the city were erected and continually expanded, with several towers maintained by different craftsmen's guilds, according to the medieval custom. Part of the fortification ensemble was recently restored using [[UNESCO]] funds, and other projects are ongoing. At least two entrances to the city, ''Poarta Ecaterinei'' (or ''Katharinentor'') and ''Poarta \u0218chei'' (or ''Waisenhausg\u00e4ssertor''), are still in existence. The city center is marked by the mayor's former office building ([[:ro:Casa Sfatului din Bra\u0219ov|Casa Sfatului]]) and the surrounding square (''pia\u021ba''), which includes one of the oldest buildings in Bra\u0219ov, the Hirscher Haus. Nearby is the \"Black Church\" (''[[Biserica Neagr\u0103]]''), which some claim to be the largest [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] church in [[Southeastern Europe]].\n\nIn 1689, a great fire destroyed the walled city almost entirely, and its rebuilding lasted several decades.\n\nBesides the German (Saxon) population living in the walled city and in the northern suburbs, Bra\u0219ov had also a significant Romanian and Bulgarian population (living in the [[\u0218cheii Bra\u0219ovului|\u0218chei]] district), and also some Hungarian population (living in the Blum\u0103na district). The cultural and religious importance of the Romanian church and school in \u0218chei is underlined by the generous donations received from more than thirty [[hospodar]]s of Moldavia and Wallachia, as well as that from [[Elizabeth of Russia]]. In the 17th and 19th centuries, the Romanians in \u0218chei campaigned for national, political, and cultural rights, and were supported in their efforts by Romanians from all other provinces, as well as by the local Greek merchant community. In 1838, they established the first Romanian language newspaper ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'' and the first Romanian institutions of higher education: ''\u0218colile Centrale Greco-Ortodoxe'' (\"The Greek-Orthodox Central Schools\", today named after [[Andrei \u0218aguna]]). The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and sovereign of Transylvania [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] awarded Romanians citizenship rights for a brief period during the latter decades of the 18th century.\n\nIn 1850, the town had 21,782 inhabitants: 8,874 (40.7%) Germans, 8,727 (40%) Romanians, 2,939 (13.4%) Hungarians.<ref name=\"varga.adatbank.transindex.ro\">{{cite web|url=http://varga.adatbank.transindex.ro/?pg=3&action=etnik&id=5861|title=Erd\u00e9ly etnikai \u00e9s felekezeti statisztik\u00e1ja|website=varga.adatbank.transindex.ro|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219010951/http://varga.adatbank.transindex.ro/?pg=3&action=etnik&id=5861|archivedate=2007-12-19}}</ref> In 1910 there were 41,056 inhabitants: 10,841 (26.4%) Germans, 11,786 (28.7%) Romanians, 17,831 (43.4%) Hungarians.\n<ref name=\"varga.adatbank.transindex.ro\"/>\n\nOn 29 August 1916, during the [[First World War]], the [[Romanian Army]] occupied Bra\u0219ov.

The inter-war period was a time of flourishing economy and cultural life in general, which included the Saxons in Bra\u0219ov as well. However, at the end of World War II many ethnic Germans were forcibly deported to the [[Soviet Union]]. A majority of them emigrated to [[West Germany]] after [[Communist Romania|Romania became a democratic country]].\n\nThe first Jewish community in Bra\u0219ov was established in 1828, joining the [[Neolog Judaism|Neolog]] association in 1868. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] founded their religious organization in 1877. The Neolog synagogue, seating 800, was built between 1899\u20131905. During the [[interwar period]], the communities had separate institutions, but opened a jointly managed school in 1940. Zionist organizations appeared already in 1920. By 1930, Jews numbered 2594 individuals, or 4% of the total population. In autumn 1940, during the [[National Legionary State]], the antisemitic [[Iron Guard]] nationalized all Jewish institutions and seized most shops owned by Jews. In 1941, Jews were drafted for service in forced labor battalions. Those from throughout southern Transylvania were concentrated in Bra\u0219ov; a further 200 refugees came from [[Ploie\u0219ti]]. In August 1942, 850 Jews between the ages of 18 and 50 were drafted into labor battalions and ordered to work in Bra\u0219ov, while others were sent to [[Predeal]] and [[Bran, Bra\u0219ov|Bran]]. In spring 1943, 250 youths were sent to [[Suraia]] camp to build fortifications. After the [[King Michael Coup]] of August 1944, the labor battalions were reduced to 250-300 while most of the Jews managed to obtain their freedom. In 1945\u20131946, the Jewish population increased to 3500.<ref>Shmuel Spector, Geoffrey Wigoder (eds.), ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: A-J'', p. 182.

Under [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]'s rule, the city was the site of the [[1987 Bra\u0219ov strike]]. This was brutally repressed by the authorities and resulted in numerous workers being imprisoned.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n[[File:UTB - IAR-22 tractor 1.jpg|thumb|First Romanian-made tractor, the IAR 22]]\n\nIndustrial development in Bra\u0219ov started in the inter-war period, with one of the largest factories being the airplane manufacturing plant ([[Industria Aeronautic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103|IAR]] Bra\u0219ov), which produced the first Romanian fighter planes used during World War II. After signing the armistice with [[USSR]] on September 12, 1944, the factory started repairing trucks, and on October 1945 it began manufacturing agricultural tractors. [[IAR 22 (tractor)|IAR 22]] was the first Romanian-made wheeled tractor. In 1948 the company was renamed \"[[Uzina Tractorul Bra\u0219ov]]\" known internationally as [[Universal Tractor Bra\u0219ov]]. Aircraft manufacturing resumed in 1968 at first under the name ICA and then under its old name of [[Industria Aeronautic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103|IAR]] at a new location in nearby [[Ghimbav]].\n\nIndustrialization was accelerated in the Communist era, with special emphasis being placed on heavy industry, attracting many workers from other parts of the country. Heavy industry is still abundant, including [[Roman (vehicle manufacturer)|Roman]], which manufactures [[MAN SE|MAN AG]] trucks as well as native-designed trucks and coaches. Although the industrial base has been in decline in recent years, Bra\u0219ov is still a site for manufacturing hydraulic transmissions, auto parts, ball-bearings, construction materials, hand tools, furniture, textiles and shoe-wear.

However, there is no foreseeable date for starting construction.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Brasov, Piata Sfatului.jpg|thumb|The city center ([[Bra\u0219ov Council Square (Pia\u021ba Sfatului)|Pia\u021ba Sfatului]])]]\nWith its central location, Bra\u0219ov is a suitable location from which to explore Romania, and the distances to several tourist destinations (including the [[Black Sea]] resorts, the monasteries in northern Moldavia, and the wooden churches of [[Maramure\u0219 region|Maramure\u0219]]) are similar. It is also the largest city in a mountain resorts area. The old city is very well preserved and is best seen by taking the cable-car to the top of T\u00e2mpa Mountain.\n\nTemperatures from May to September fluctuate around {{convert|23|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Bra\u0219ov benefits from a winter tourism season centered on [[winter sports]] and other activities. [[Poiana Bra\u0219ov]] is the most popular Romanian [[ski resort]] and an important tourist center preferred by many tourists from other European states.\n\nThe city also has several restaurants that serve local as well as international cuisine (e.g. Hungarian and Chinese). Some of these are situated in the city center.\n\n=== Sights ===\n\n* ''[[Biserica Neagr\u0103]]'' (\"The Black Church\"), a celebrated [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] site - the building dates from 1477, when it replaced an older church (demolished around 1385).

The Transylvanian Sports Museum is among the oldest in the country and presents the evolution of consecrated sports in the city. During the communist period, [[universiade]]s and [[Daciad]]s were held, where local sportsmen were obliged to participate. Nowadays, the infrastructure of the city allows other sports to be practiced, such as football, rugby, tennis, cycling, handball, gliding, skiing, skating, mountain climbing, paintball, bowling, swimming, target shooting, basketball, martial arts, equestrian, volleyball or gymnastics. Annually, at \"Olimpia\" sports ground, the \"Bra\u0219ov Challenge Cup\" tennis competition is held.\n\n[[Col\u021bea Bra\u0219ov]] was the football champion in 1928, managing a second place in 1927, in its only 10 years of existence (1921\u20131931). It was succeeded by [[Bra\u0219ovia Bra\u0219ov]].\n\nBetween 17 and 22 February 2013, the city hosted the [[2013 European Youth Winter Olympic Festival]].\n\n{{As of|2012}}, Bra\u0219ov is hosting two trail semi-marathons: the Semimaraton Intersport Bra\u0219ov (held in April) and the Bra\u0219ov International Marathon (held in April or May).\n\nIn November 2013, Bra\u0219ov submitted their bid for the [[2020 Winter Youth Olympics]]. They were up against [[Lausanne, Switzerland]] to be awarded the event. In December that year, the city was signed the Youth Olympic Game Candidature Procedure.

Archaeologists working from the last half of the 19th century discovered continuous traces of human settlements in areas situated in Bra\u0219ov: Valea Cet\u0103\u021bii, Pietrele lui Solomon, \u0218prenghi, T\u00e2mpa, Dealul Melcilor, and Noua. The first three locations show traces of [[Dacians|Dacian]] citadels; \u0218prenghi Hill housed a [[Roman Dacia|Roman]]-style construction. The last two locations had their names applied to [[Bronze Age]] cultures \u2014 ''[[Schneckenberg culture|Schneckenberg]]'' (\"Hill of the Snails\"; Early Bronze Age){{sfn| Coles| Harding | 1979|p=140}} and ''[[Noua culture|Noua]]'' (\"The New\"; Late Bronze Age).{{sfn| Coles| Harding | 1979|p=410}}\n\n[[Transylvanian Saxons]] played a decisive role in Bra\u0219ov's development and were invited by [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] kings to develop towns, build mines, and cultivate the land of [[Transylvania]] at different stages between 1141 and 1300. The settlers came primarily from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and the [[Moselle]] region, with others from [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Wallonia]] and even [[France]].\n\nIn 1211, by order of King [[Andrew II of Hungary]], the [[Teutonic Knights]] fortified the [[Burzenland]] to defend the border of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. On the site of the village of Bra\u0219ov, the Teutonic Knights built Kronstadt \u2013 'the City of the Crown'.<ref>Mediaeval studies, Volumes 17-18, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1955, Toronto, Canada, An annual journal of scholarship, History, {{ISSN|0076-5872}}</ref> Although the crusaders were evicted by 1225, the colonists they brought in long ago remained, along with local population in three distinct settlements they founded on the site of Bra\u0219ov:\n*''Corona'', around the Black Church (Biserica Neagr\u0103);\n*''Martinsberg'', west of Cet\u0103\u021buia Hill;\n*''Bartholom\u00e4'', on the eastern side of Sprenghi Hill.\n[[File:Brasov 1689.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the walled city prior to the 1689 fire]]\nGermans living in Bra\u0219ov were mainly involved in trade and crafts. The location of the city at the intersection of trade routes linking the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Western Europe]], together with certain tax exemptions, allowed Saxon merchants to obtain considerable wealth and exert a strong political influence. They contributed a great deal to the architectural flavor of the city. Fortifications around the city were erected and continually expanded, with several towers maintained by different craftsmen's guilds, according to the medieval custom. Part of the fortification ensemble was recently restored using [[UNESCO]] funds, and other projects are ongoing. At least two entrances to the city, ''Poarta Ecaterinei'' (or ''Katharinentor'') and ''Poarta \u0218chei'' (or ''Waisenhausg\u00e4ssertor''), are still in existence. The city center is marked by the mayor's former office building ([[:ro:Casa Sfatului din Bra\u0219ov|Casa Sfatului]]) and the surrounding square (''pia\u021ba''), which includes one of the oldest buildings in Bra\u0219ov, the Hirscher Haus. Nearby is the \"Black Church\" (''[[Biserica Neagr\u0103]]''), which some claim to be the largest [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] church in [[Southeastern Europe]].\n\nIn 1689, a great fire destroyed the walled city almost entirely, and its rebuilding lasted several decades.\n\nBesides the German (Saxon) population living in the walled city and in the northern suburbs, Bra\u0219ov had also a significant Romanian and Bulgarian population (living in the [[\u0218cheii Bra\u0219ovului|\u0218chei]] district), and also some Hungarian population (living in the Blum\u0103na district). The cultural and religious importance of the Romanian church and school in \u0218chei is underlined by the generous donations received from more than thirty [[hospodar]]s of Moldavia and Wallachia, as well as that from [[Elizabeth of Russia]]. In the 17th and 19th centuries, the Romanians in \u0218chei campaigned for national, political, and cultural rights, and were supported in their efforts by Romanians from all other provinces, as well as by the local Greek merchant community. In 1838, they established the first Romanian language newspaper ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'' and the first Romanian institutions of higher education: ''\u0218colile Centrale Greco-Ortodoxe'' (\"The Greek-Orthodox Central Schools\", today named after [[Andrei \u0218aguna]]). The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and sovereign of Transylvania [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] awarded Romanians citizenship rights for a brief period during the latter decades of the 18th century.\n\nIn 1850, the town had 21,782 inhabitants: 8,874 (40.7%) Germans, 8,727 (40%) Romanians, 2,939 (13.4%) Hungarians.<ref name=\"varga.adatbank.transindex.ro\">{{cite web|url=http://varga.adatbank.transindex.ro/?pg=3&action=etnik&id=5861|title=Erd\u00e9ly etnikai \u00e9s felekezeti statisztik\u00e1ja|website=varga.adatbank.transindex.ro|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219010951/http://varga.adatbank.transindex.ro/?pg=3&action=etnik&id=5861|archivedate=2007-12-19}}</ref> In 1910 there were 41,056 inhabitants: 10,841 (26.4%) Germans, 11,786 (28.7%) Romanians, 17,831 (43.4%) Hungarians.\n<ref name=\"varga.adatbank.transindex.ro\"/>\n\nOn 29 August 1916, during the [[First World War]], the [[Romanian Army]] occupied Bra\u0219ov.

[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] founded their religious organization in 1877. The Neolog synagogue, seating 800, was built between 1899\u20131905. During the [[interwar period]], the communities had separate institutions, but opened a jointly managed school in 1940. Zionist organizations appeared already in 1920. By 1930, Jews numbered 2594 individuals, or 4% of the total population. In autumn 1940, during the [[National Legionary State]], the antisemitic [[Iron Guard]] nationalized all Jewish institutions and seized most shops owned by Jews. In 1941, Jews were drafted for service in forced labor battalions. Those from throughout southern Transylvania were concentrated in Bra\u0219ov; a further 200 refugees came from [[Ploie\u0219ti]]. In August 1942, 850 Jews between the ages of 18 and 50 were drafted into labor battalions and ordered to work in Bra\u0219ov, while others were sent to [[Predeal]] and [[Bran, Bra\u0219ov|Bran]]. In spring 1943, 250 youths were sent to [[Suraia]] camp to build fortifications. After the [[King Michael Coup]] of August 1944, the labor battalions were reduced to 250-300 while most of the Jews managed to obtain their freedom. In 1945\u20131946, the Jewish population increased to 3500.<ref>Shmuel Spector, Geoffrey Wigoder (eds.), ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: A-J'', p. 182.

Under [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]]'s rule, the city was the site of the [[1987 Bra\u0219ov strike]]. This was brutally repressed by the authorities and resulted in numerous workers being imprisoned.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n[[File:UTB - IAR-22 tractor 1.jpg|thumb|First Romanian-made tractor, the IAR 22]]\n\nIndustrial development in Bra\u0219ov started in the inter-war period, with one of the largest factories being the airplane manufacturing plant ([[Industria Aeronautic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103|IAR]] Bra\u0219ov), which produced the first Romanian fighter planes used during World War II. After signing the armistice with [[USSR]] on September 12, 1944, the factory started repairing trucks, and on October 1945 it began manufacturing agricultural tractors. [[IAR 22 (tractor)|IAR 22]] was the first Romanian-made wheeled tractor. In 1948 the company was renamed \"[[Uzina Tractorul Bra\u0219ov]]\" known internationally as [[Universal Tractor Bra\u0219ov]]. Aircraft manufacturing resumed in 1968 at first under the name ICA and then under its old name of [[Industria Aeronautic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103|IAR]] at a new location in nearby [[Ghimbav]].\n\nIndustrialization was accelerated in the Communist era, with special emphasis being placed on heavy industry, attracting many workers from other parts of the country. Heavy industry is still abundant, including [[Roman (vehicle manufacturer)|Roman]], which manufactures [[MAN SE|MAN AG]] trucks as well as native-designed trucks and coaches. Although the industrial base has been in decline in recent years, Bra\u0219ov is still a site for manufacturing hydraulic transmissions, auto parts, ball-bearings, construction materials, hand tools, furniture, textiles and shoe-wear. There is also a large brewery. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Demographics==\nBra\u0219ov has a total population of 253,200 (2011 census).\nIts ethnic composition includes:\n\n*[[Romanians]]: 208,019 (91.3%)\n*[[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]]: 16,172 (7.1%)\n*[[Germans in Romania|Germans]] <small>([[Transylvanian Saxons]])</small>: 1,079 (0.5%)\n*[[Romani people]]: 916 (0.4%)\n*Other ethnicities: 1,037 (0.7%)\n\nIn 2005, the [[Bra\u0219ov metropolitan area]] was created.

The project consists of a terminal capable of handling 1 million passengers per year and a {{convert|2,800|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} runway.\nThe [[A3 (Romania)|A3]] highway is also planned to pass the city. However, there is no foreseeable date for starting construction.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Brasov, Piata Sfatului.jpg|thumb|The city center ([[Bra\u0219ov Council Square (Pia\u021ba Sfatului)|Pia\u021ba Sfatului]])]]\nWith its central location, Bra\u0219ov is a suitable location from which to explore Romania, and the distances to several tourist destinations (including the [[Black Sea]] resorts, the monasteries in northern Moldavia, and the wooden churches of [[Maramure\u0219 region|Maramure\u0219]]) are similar. It is also the largest city in a mountain resorts area. The old city is very well preserved and is best seen by taking the cable-car to the top of T\u00e2mpa Mountain.\n\nTemperatures from May to September fluctuate around {{convert|23|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Bra\u0219ov benefits from a winter tourism season centered on [[winter sports]] and other activities. [[Poiana Bra\u0219ov]] is the most popular Romanian [[ski resort]] and an important tourist center preferred by many tourists from other European states.\n\nThe city also has several restaurants that serve local as well as international cuisine (e.g. Hungarian and Chinese).

The Transylvanian Sports Museum is among the oldest in the country and presents the evolution of consecrated sports in the city. During the communist period, [[universiade]]s and [[Daciad]]s were held, where local sportsmen were obliged to participate. Nowadays, the infrastructure of the city allows other sports to be practiced, such as football, rugby, tennis, cycling, handball, gliding, skiing, skating, mountain climbing, paintball, bowling, swimming, target shooting, basketball, martial arts, equestrian, volleyball or gymnastics. Annually, at \"Olimpia\" sports ground, the \"Bra\u0219ov Challenge Cup\" tennis competition is held.\n\n[[Col\u021bea Bra\u0219ov]] was the football champion in 1928, managing a second place in 1927, in its only 10 years of existence (1921\u20131931).

He later attended the [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. Johns College]], [[Annapolis, Maryland]], and graduated with [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. Following his graduation, Bourke served with the [[Maryland National Guard]] along the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border, before he accepted the commission as second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on February 5, 1917.\n\nWhile en route to [[Santo Domingo]] for his first tour, he and 50 recruits were diverted to [[St. Croix]], becoming the first U.S. troops to land on what had just become the [[American Virgin Islands]].\n\nPost-[[World War I]] tours included service at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico|Quantico]], [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island]], [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego|San Diego]], and [[Headquarters Marine Corps]].

He also served at [[Pearl Harbor]]; was commanding officer of the Legation Guard in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]]; saw sea duty on board the [[battleship]] {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48}}; and commanded the [[10th Marine Regiment (United States)|10th Marine Regiment]].\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]] and [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa campaigns]], General Bourke was assigned as the [[V Amphibious Corps]] [[artillery]] officer for the [[Battle of Saipan|invasion of Saipan]]. He next trained combined [[United States Army|Army]]-[[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] artillery units for the [[XXIV Corps (United States)|XXIV Army Corps]], then preparing for the [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte operation]]. With [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] secured, he assumed command of the 5th Marine Division which was planning for the [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]].\n\nAfter the war's sudden end, the division landed at [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]], [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], and assumed occupation duties. With disbandment of the [[5th Marine Division (United States)|5th Marine Division]], General Bourke became deputy commander and inspector general of [[Fleet Marine Force Pacific]]. Bourke retired from the Marine Corps in 1946 with a rank of lieutenant general.\n\nBourke died in 1978.  He is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].\n\n==Awards==\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|other_device=nv|ribbon=Legion of Merit ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=1|type=award-star|ribbon=Bronze Star ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=United States Navy Presidential Unit Citation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Marine Corps Expeditionary ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Mexican Border Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=World War I Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Nicaraguan Campaign ribbon 1933.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=1|type=service-star|ribbon=American Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=American Campaign Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=4|type=service-star|ribbon=Asiatic-Pacific Campaign ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=World War II Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Army of Occupation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=2|type=service-star|ribbon=Phliber rib.png|width=106}}\n|-\n|} \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!1st row\n|colspan=\"14\" align=\"center\" |[[Legion of Merit]] with [[\"V\" Device|Combat \"V\"]]\n|-\n!2nd row\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] with one [[5/16 inch star|{{frac|5|16}}\" gold star]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Navy Presidential Unit Citation]] with one star\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Mexican Border Service Medal]]\n|-\n!3rd row\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|World War I Victory Medal]] with one clasp\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Nicaraguan Campaign Medal|Second Nicaraguan Campaign Medal]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[American Defense Service Medal]] with Fleet [[medal bar|clasp]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[American Campaign Medal]]\n|-\n!4th row\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with four [[Service star|3/16 inch service star]]s\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[World War II Victory Medal (United States)|World War II Victory Medal]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Navy Occupation Service Medal]]\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|[[Philippine Liberation Medal]] with two stars\n|-\n|}\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|World War II}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051127102834/http://www.nps.gov/wapa/indepth/extContent/usmc/pcn-190-003143-00/sec1d.htm NPS biography of Thomas Bourke]\n*[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/tebourke.htm Thomas Eugene Bourke, Lieutenant General, United States Marine Corps], Arlington National Cemetery profile.\n{{Commons|Thomas E.

He practised as a [[barrister]] from 1881.\n\n==Early radical years==\nHe was born in Clashaganny, [[County Roscommon]]<ref>Entry UK Census 1911.</ref> and was the third son of Patrick Power from [[Ballinasloe]] and his wife Mary O'Connor of County Roscommon,<ref>\"Biographies of Candidates\", ''The Times'', 25 November 1885; Register ... Middle Temple, ii, 609.</ref> during the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)|Potato Famine]] years.

It was here that he first met [[Michael Davitt]].<ref name=\"Moody\"/>\n\nHe became known to the police under alias names 'John Fleming', 'John Webster', 'Charles Ferguson'.<ref name=\"Moody\"/> After being involved in the abortive raid on [[Chester Castle]] in February 1867, he evaded capture and was sent to the United States later that year at the age of 21 to discuss reorganisation of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|Fenians]]. After his return he was arrested in Dublin on 17 February 1868 and spent five months in [[Kilmainham Gaol|Kilmainham]] and [[Mountjoy Gaol|Mountjoy]] jails.<ref name=\"Moody\"/> The County of Dublin Gaol, Kilmainham file holds a 'photograph and description of a prisoner who was formerly in custody under the Lord Lieutenant's warrant, charged with treasonable practices and discharged on bail on 29 July 1868.' John Power, alias John Webster, alias Charles Fleming was a Roman Catholic who was born in County Roscommon. He was 5&nbsp;ft 9in, 'stout', with a long face, dark brown hair, grey eyes, a large nose and a large mouth. His whiskers were dark and he had no beard. His fresh complexion was pitted and he had a large wart on the small finger of his left hand. His make was 'ordinary'. He was a newspaper reporter and lived in Lancashire, in Bolton or in Rochdale.<ref>National Archives of Ireland</ref>\n\nHe was a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) Supreme Council and was believed to be involved in gun-running (a matter on which in later life he threatened legal action). While he remained an active member during his early years in Parliament, as early as 1868\u201369 he had promoted co-operation with constitutional politicians such as [[George Henry Moore (politician)|George Henry Moore]].<ref name =\"Jackson\">Alvin Jackson, ''Home Rule. An Irish History 1800\u20132000'', London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2003.</ref> It was the beginning of the [[New Departure (Ireland)|New Departure.]]\n\nFrom January 1871 to 1874 he was a student and teacher at [[St. Jarlath's College]], [[Tuam]], with his fees and expenses paid by a combination of teaching and lectures in Britain and America. In his final year he was Professor of Humanities in the college.<ref>The Tablet, 6 June 1874.</ref>\n\n==Early parliamentary years==\n[[File:John O'Connor Power Vanity Fair 25 December 1886.jpg|thumb|left|<center>\"the brains of [[Obstructionism|Obstruction]]\"<br>Caricature by \"Spy\" ([[Leslie Ward]]) in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]], 25 December 1886</center>]]\nWhile still at St. Jarlath's, Power signalled his intention in January 1874 to stand for election to the [[British House of Commons]]; and to take the oath of allegiance to the Queen and his seat if elected. Although there was clerical opposition, he was supported by [[John MacHale]], [[Archbishop of Tuam]] and Fr Ulick Burke, President of St Jarlath's,<ref>Moran, Gerard,  ''A Radical Priest in Mayo, The Rise and'' ''Fall of an Irish Nationalist, 1825\u201386'', 1994 p.146.

Biggar]] therefore pioneered<ref>[[T. W. Moody]], \"Fenianism, Home Rule and the Land War\" in ''The Course of Irish History'', Lanham, MD: Roberts Rinehart, 2001.</ref> the new policy of [[obstructionism]], whereby they obstructed House of Commons business by making long speeches and manipulating its procedures. They were joined in this more successful policy by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] on his election in April 1875. The O'Donoghue, M.P. for County Kerry, in a letter to Cardinal Cullen, 6 August 1877, denounced the strategy: 'It is Fenianism in a new form.'<ref>The O'Donoghue to Cardinal Cullen, 6 August 1877, Cardinal Cullen Papers, 329/3</ref>\n\nIn August 1875 O'Connor Power was interviewed by his close associate [[James Joseph O'Kelly]] for an article in the ''New York Herald'' prior to his six-month tour of North America to promote Home Rule. The ''Herald'''s editorial suggested that Power was 'the most able, eloquent and competent available man' to encourage the constitutional approach.<ref>''Ireland in an Imperial World'' 'A Cosmopolitan Nationalist: James Joseph O'Kelly', Paul Townend, 2017, p. 229.  See also ''That Irishman'', pp. 67-65.</ref>\n\nO'Connor Power spoke strongly and repeatedly in Parliament from 1874 to 1877 for amnesty for Michael Davitt, imprisoned in [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor]], and other Fenian prisoners, and brought to notice perceived unfairness of their treatment as common criminals rather than as political prisoners.<ref>Such as on 13 July 1874, March 1875, 1 August 1876, June 1877, and 20 July 1877.</ref> This led to Gladstone lending his support to Fenian amnesty and he spent three weeks in Kilruddery House, County Wicklow, from mid-October to November 11th. Davitt was released early on 19 December 1877, and Fenians Thomas Chambers, Charles McCarthy and John Patrick O'Brien followed in January 1878.<ref name=\"Moody\"/> Charles McCarthy collapsed and died in Dublin shortly after his release. The ex-prisoners travelled back to London and, 13 February, visited O'Connor Power in 'a private room in Parliament House, where they wrote out their statements giving the details of sufferings endured and the treatment to which they had been subjected ... He [O'Connor Power] and Davitt therefore had them printed in pamphlet form and circulated.'<ref>D.B.Cashman, 'The Life of Michael Davitt and the Rise and Development of the Irish National Land League' (1881) pp.62\u201363.</ref> This was published, with a selection of O'Connor Power's speeches on amnesty in the House of Commons, in March 1878.<ref>Jane Stanford, 'That Irishman', pp 64\u201365</ref>\n\nIn 1876, O'Connor Power and Parnell were sent to the United States by the [[Home Rule League]] to congratulate the President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on the [[American Centennial]]. At an informal meeting with the President, they asked that Ireland's bid for independence be given recognition. Power presented an address to the House of Representatives and on 4 March 1877 the House passed a unanimous resolution recognising the services rendered by Irishmen to the United States and concluded that the principles of self-government be established as a sacred heritage to all future generations. He also used the American visit to resume contact with nationalist supporters, and is almost certainly the IRB agent referred to as 'Shields'.<ref>''Devoy's Post Bag, 1871\u20131928'', eds William O'Brien and Desmond Ryan, vol. I, 1871\u20131880, Dublin: C. J. Fallon, 1948, pp. 192-93ff. Shields is mentioned on p. 198, the final reference to him on p. 329. A letter dated 16 May 1878 states: \"Mr Shields is not now in business, having entirely given up the trade.\"</ref>\n \nO'Connor Power was best known for his work in the radical wing of the [[Home Rule League]] and support for tenant farmers' rights, on which he spoke forcefully in Parliament,<ref>David Thornley, ''Isaac Butt and Home Rule'', London: MacGibbon and Kee, 1964, p. 280.</ref>\n\nHe was generally considered by the Fenians to have [[selling out|sold out]] to constitutionalism during his career. Along with [[Joseph Gillis Biggar|J. G. Biggar]], he was expelled from the IRB Supreme Council in 1876.<ref name =\"Jackson\"/> The Fenians of the \"[[New Departure (Ireland)|New Departure]]\" refused to work with him and it was Parnell who become the man to bridge the gap between the Fenians and constitutionalists. The IRB expelled Parliamentarians. Under no circumstances should the Fenians co-operate with the constitutional policy. O'Connor Power resigned, 'Our great idea was to keep the spirit of nationality alive.' The North of England seceded, withdrawing allegiance to the Supreme Council. The move cost the IRB a significant loss of membership.<ref>Barry O'Brien, ''Parnell'', p.125.</ref> In July 1906 Dr William Carroll wrote to John Devoy that at that time the original Home Rulers lost much of the Fenian support when the IRB expelled them, 'although at a meeting near Manchester, England, at which Davitt, Chambers and other Fenians met the IRB men, a ''modus vivendi'' was agreed upon which enabled both to go on with their work without clashing.'<ref>Michael Davitt, John Devoy, From the Gaelic American,p.89, eds Carla King , W J McCormack, UCD Press, 2008.</ref>\n\n[[T. D. Sullivan]] presents an anecdote from 1876 that illustrates the distance that grew between O'Connor Power in his Home Rule days and some of his former radical nationalist colleagues:<blockquote>An immense mass of people assembled in the [[Free Trade Hall]] [Manchester] on the 16 September 1876, to hear a lecture from Mr. John O'Connor Power, MP, on a non-political subject. The chair was taken by Mr. [[Joseph Gillis Biggar|J. G. Biggar]], MP. On rising to introduce the lecturer, he soon discerned that trouble was impending, that there was, so to say, \"a storm in the offing.\" An \"Advanced\" person, a Mr. Flesh of [[Ramsbottom]], came on the Platform and informed him that at a meeting of Nationalists held on the previous evening, it was decided that the lecture might be allowed to proceed only on the condition that the lecturer should first answer satisfactorily a series of questions which had been drawn up for him. The main purpose of those interrogatories was to ascertain whether he held and was prepared to support the principles of [[Wolfe Tone]], [[Lord Edward Fitzgerald]], and [[Robert Emmet]]. The chairman said those questions were not in order, as the lecture was to be on a non-political subject; however, he would leave it to the lecturer to deal with the queries as he thought fit, Mr. O'Connor Power then came to the front and said, amidst much noise, that with regard to the questions that had been read, his view was identical with that of the chairman. He begged leave to point out \u2013 He could say no more: the platform was rushed; there was a smashing of chairs and tables, a noise of heavy blows, and of fierce exclamations from men engaged in close combat, mingled with the shouts and screams of women, while blood flowed freely from many wounded persons ... The subject of Mr. O'Connor Power's intended lecture was \"Irish Wit and Humour\".\n<ref>[[T. D. Sullivan]], ''[http://www.quinnipiac.edu/other/abl/etext/irish/trouble/irishpolitics.html Recollections of Troubled Times in Irish Politics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905065409/http://www.quinnipiac.edu/other/abl/etext/irish/trouble/Irishpolitics.html |date=5 September 2006 }}'', Dublin: Sealy, Bryers & Walker/M. H. Gill & Son, 1905, p. 134.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nO'Connor Power delivered the lecture, within a fortnight, in the same hall, and Biggar again presided. This time, \"the Irish of Manchester and Liverpool, revolutionaries and constitutionalists, banded together to put down any rowdyism should it again arise; but instead of that, O'Connor Power was received with 'deafening cheers, again and again repeated' according to a newspaper report\".<ref>Michael MacDonagh, ''The Home Rule Movement'', Dublin: Talbot Press; London: T. F. Unwin, 1920. p. 119.</ref>\n\nO'Connor Power had an uneasy working relationship with Parnell, who he thought was \"a respectable mediocrity\". [[T. M. Healy]] narrates an incident from 1878:<blockquote>... I wrote Maurice:<br />\nLondon,<br />\nOctober, '78.<br />\n\"Would it be possible to get up a meeting in Lismore, and invite Parnell? The resolution I moved in Dublin at the Confederation of Great Britain was at his request, upon a suggestion of my own. If he could have O'Connor Power at his elbow continually it would be a good thing, as Power understands the necessities of agitation, and Parnell doesn't. I hope he will make a good fist of his answer to Butt, though I have never been persuaded that he shines as a letter-writer. [[Daniel Crilly|Dan Crilly]] told me Parnell's first contribution to the ''Liverpool Argus'' (mentioned in my London letter) was not worth much, and though he promised to insert it, he has failed me.\"\n\nO'Connor Power and Parnell were not kindred spirits. Power was an able and eloquent man, \"reeking of the common clay\", at which Parnell's aristocratic sensitiveness recoiled. \"Of their differences I hinted to my brother\":\n\nLondon,<br />\n24 November 1878.<br />\n\"I met O'Connor Power, and he was unaware, until I told him, that his name was down to propose one of the resolutions in Dublin. He expressed disgust, and said he told the Dublin people he would not go over, and that it was only another piece of their cowardice in being afraid to face Butt themselves.\n\nI was aware of the stories told about Power, but what is the use of repeating them? Parnell has been careful to tell me his views about Power (and so has Biggar), but I have defended him to them, and think they should make allowance for his poverty and position. Parnell told Power to his face that he was \"a damned scoundrel,\" and Power made a coarse reply ...\"\n\n<ref>[[T. M. Healy]], [http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/THealy/healy5.htm ''Letters and Leaders of My Day'', Chapter 5].</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Land War==\nHowever, O'Connor Power retained credibility with small tenant farmers and addressed the [[James Daly (Irish Land League)#Leadup to the 20 April 1879 Irishtown Meeting|Tenant-Right Meeting]] at [[Irishtown, County Mayo]] on 20 April 1879, which launched the protest movement that led to the [[Irish National Land League]].<ref name=\"Jordan\">Donald Jordan, \"John O'Connor Power, Charles Stewart Parnell and the centralisation of popular politics in Ireland\", ''Irish Historical Studies'' 25 (1986), 46\u201366.</ref> He was 'the only member of Parliament invited to or who attended the historic Irishtown meeting.'<ref>Davitt, Michael, ''The Fall of Feudalism'', p. 146</ref>\n\nT. M. Healy writes of the Irishtown meeting:\n\n'Power's presence there gave birth to the Land League and made history ... No reporters attended the meeting. Power called on me when he returned to London to give an account of it. From what he said I realised that a new portent had arisen out of a leaden sky. He related that footmen in legions, and horsemen in squadrons, gathered round him to demand reductions of rent. The horsemen, he declared, were organised like cavalry regiments. The police were powerless, and Power foreshadowed that Ireland was on the verge of a movement which would end a dismal chapter. Yet his meeting was unnoted, save by a local weekly ''The Connaught'' ''Telegraph'', owned by James Daly.'<ref>Connaught Telegraph, 21 April 1879, Healy, T. M., Letters and Leaders of My Day, chap. vi.</ref>\n\nWilliam O'Brien recounts:\n\n'The whole countryside had flocked together, as at a word of command, including horsemen enough to form a regiment of cavalry, and Mr. Power, who had sounded all the subterranean depths of Irish disaffection, spoke very solemnly of what was coming. It was the first whisper I heard of the Land League movement, although even the name was not yet invented.'\n\nAfter Parnell and Davitt addressed the follow-up meeting at [[Westport, County Mayo]] on 8 June 1879 they took control of the growing [[Land War]]. [[T. M. Healy]] gives his view of how O'Connor Power was frozen out of the Land League:<ref>[[T. M. Healy]], ''[http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/THealy/healy6.htm ''Letters and Leaders of My Day'', Chapter 6.]</ref>\n<blockquote>\nStirrings of ambition and resentment may have been ingredients in Parnell's action in joining Davitt and cold-shouldering Power, but what can lessen admiration for the pluck with which he threw himself into a movement which involved him and his relatives in danger and loss? His rents in Co. Wicklow and those of his brothers in Armagh and Carlow were at stake.\n\nTowards the close of the session Power wrote me:\n\nHouse of Commons,<br />\n4 August 1879.<br />\nMy Dear Healy,<br />\nFinegan told me you would be down to-night, but I have not been so fortunate as to come across you.\n\nIf you have seen my article in the ''Fortnightly'',<ref>' O'Connor Power, 'Fallacies about Home Rule', ''Fortnightly Review'', Aug. 1879.</ref> I would feel obliged by your noticing it in your letter this week. The cynical ''Saturday Review'' noticed it fairly enough, but I have seen no notice of it in any Irish paper.\"<br />\nEver sincerely,<br />\nJ. O'Connor Power.\n\nI complied, but owing to his strained relations with Parnell and Biggar, he went to Dublin to examine the position, and wrote me:\n\n\"... Davitt met me on my arrival here \u2013 a reception unexpected on my part. He is writing an appeal to the Irish at home and abroad, for funds to carry on the Land agitation, and working hard to abolish the Home Rule League.\n\nI am here just in time for Thursday's meeting, when the Home Rule League will be \"tried for life\" and perhaps condemned. Parnell's resolutions evidently tend in that direction.\"\n\nPower's letter was written from the lodgings of [[Thomas Brennan (Irish Land League)|Tom Brennan]], who three months later, became secretary to the Land League, when Davitt was made its chief organiser, and Parnell (with [[John Dillon|Dillon]]) was accredited envoy to the United States.\n\nPower, who started the movement, was left \"festering outside-the breastworks,\" without control or influence in the new organisation.\n</blockquote>\nIn 'The Irish Land Agitation', published in the ''Nineteenth Century'', December 1879, O'Connor Power writes on the land question, on the cry for land reform and the demands of the Irish National Land League, 'it may be useful for one connected with the movement to lay before English readers a statement explaining its causes, and presenting for serious consideration its aims and hopes and possible results.' The evils of the Irish land system must be urgently addressed and resolved:\n \n'More than three years ago I ventured during a debate in the House of Commons on the Irish land question, to predict that if the proposal then before the House to deprive the landlords of the power of eviction and rack-renting \u2013 that is to say the proposal in favour of fixity of tenure at fair rents \u2013 was not accepted, the Irish people would rise up and protest against the institution of landlordism, root and branch, and demand its abolition.'\n<ref>O'Connor Power, 'The Irish Land Agitation', 964.</ref>\n\nThough originally a friend, Davitt changed his opinion of O'Connor Power, describing him in his 'Jottings In Solitary' of 1881\u20131882 as a \"renegade to former nationalist principles: unscrupulously ambitious and untrustworthy\".<ref name=\"Moody\"/>  When Davitt moved to London he renewed his friendship with O'Connor Power.

A rebel was a patriot who failed \u2013 a patriot was a rebel who succeeded, and he thought he did not misinterpret the spirit of that assembly if he said they were ready to toast the men of '98 in either capacity. He should never cease to be grateful to the United Irishmen, not only because they had bequeathed an example of courageous patriotism, but because they had given them one cardinal principle of high policy, and that was the principle of a united Ireland.

The brave young fellows rushed to the recruiting offices in tens of thousands: most of whom now sleep their last sleep in the blood-stained fields of Europe.

As a public orator he aroused the keenest enthusiasm, while in Parliament, he was forceful and eloquent. He was one of the speakers at the Irishtown meeting when the Land League was launched. In Parliament, since 1874, as a supporter of Butt, he was again returned in '80 with Parnell, but the latter convinced that their policies were growing divergent, elected to sit for Cork city, for which he was also returned. Though there was no open rupture, Power and Parnell drifted further apart, and in 1885 the former dropped out, having previously had notable differences with Messrs Parnell, Sexton and Healy.  Since then Power twice unsuccessfully stood for English constituencies as a Radical.  Davitt and he maintained their friendship.  In 1893 Power married the widow of Mr H. F Weiss, FRCS.  One of his books dealt with the art of oratory. He was called to the English Bar in 1881.  The London Evening Standard classes him as an orator with Gladstone and Bright.\n(''[[Irish Independent]], 24 February 1919)\n\n==In literature==\n\n'And three's here for repeat of the unium!

Power presented an address to the House of Representatives and on 4 March 1877 the House passed a unanimous resolution recognising the services rendered by Irishmen to the United States and concluded that the principles of self-government be established as a sacred heritage to all future generations. He also used the American visit to resume contact with nationalist supporters, and is almost certainly the IRB agent referred to as 'Shields'.<ref>''Devoy's Post Bag, 1871\u20131928'', eds William O'Brien and Desmond Ryan, vol.

The IRB expelled Parliamentarians. Under no circumstances should the Fenians co-operate with the constitutional policy. O'Connor Power resigned, 'Our great idea was to keep the spirit of nationality alive.' The North of England seceded, withdrawing allegiance to the Supreme Council. The move cost the IRB a significant loss of membership.<ref>Barry O'Brien, ''Parnell'', p.125.</ref> In July 1906 Dr William Carroll wrote to John Devoy that at that time the original Home Rulers lost much of the Fenian support when the IRB expelled them, 'although at a meeting near Manchester, England, at which Davitt, Chambers and other Fenians met the IRB men, a ''modus vivendi'' was agreed upon which enabled both to go on with their work without clashing.'<ref>Michael Davitt, John Devoy, From the Gaelic American,p.89, eds Carla King , W J McCormack, UCD Press, 2008.</ref>\n\n[[T. D. Sullivan]] presents an anecdote from 1876 that illustrates the distance that grew between O'Connor Power in his Home Rule days and some of his former radical nationalist colleagues:<blockquote>An immense mass of people assembled in the [[Free Trade Hall]] [Manchester] on the 16 September 1876, to hear a lecture from Mr. John O'Connor Power, MP, on a non-political subject. The chair was taken by Mr. [[Joseph Gillis Biggar|J. G. Biggar]], MP. On rising to introduce the lecturer, he soon discerned that trouble was impending, that there was, so to say, \"a storm in the offing.\" An \"Advanced\" person, a Mr. Flesh of [[Ramsbottom]], came on the Platform and informed him that at a meeting of Nationalists held on the previous evening, it was decided that the lecture might be allowed to proceed only on the condition that the lecturer should first answer satisfactorily a series of questions which had been drawn up for him. The main purpose of those interrogatories was to ascertain whether he held and was prepared to support the principles of [[Wolfe Tone]], [[Lord Edward Fitzgerald]], and [[Robert Emmet]]. The chairman said those questions were not in order, as the lecture was to be on a non-political subject; however, he would leave it to the lecturer to deal with the queries as he thought fit, Mr. O'Connor Power then came to the front and said, amidst much noise, that with regard to the questions that had been read, his view was identical with that of the chairman. He begged leave to point out \u2013 He could say no more: the platform was rushed; there was a smashing of chairs and tables, a noise of heavy blows, and of fierce exclamations from men engaged in close combat, mingled with the shouts and screams of women, while blood flowed freely from many wounded persons ... The subject of Mr. O'Connor Power's intended lecture was \"Irish Wit and Humour\".\n<ref>[[T. D. Sullivan]], ''[http://www.quinnipiac.edu/other/abl/etext/irish/trouble/irishpolitics.html Recollections of Troubled Times in Irish Politics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905065409/http://www.quinnipiac.edu/other/abl/etext/irish/trouble/Irishpolitics.html |date=5 September 2006 }}'', Dublin: Sealy, Bryers & Walker/M.

This time, \"the Irish of Manchester and Liverpool, revolutionaries and constitutionalists, banded together to put down any rowdyism should it again arise; but instead of that, O'Connor Power was received with 'deafening cheers, again and again repeated' according to a newspaper report\".<ref>Michael MacDonagh, ''The Home Rule Movement'', Dublin: Talbot Press; London: T. F. Unwin, 1920. p. 119.</ref>\n\nO'Connor Power had an uneasy working relationship with Parnell, who he thought was \"a respectable mediocrity\". [[T. M. Healy]] narrates an incident from 1878:<blockquote>... I wrote Maurice:<br />\nLondon,<br />\nOctober, '78.<br />\n\"Would it be possible to get up a meeting in Lismore, and invite Parnell? The resolution I moved in Dublin at the Confederation of Great Britain was at his request, upon a suggestion of my own. If he could have O'Connor Power at his elbow continually it would be a good thing, as Power understands the necessities of agitation, and Parnell doesn't. I hope he will make a good fist of his answer to Butt, though I have never been persuaded that he shines as a letter-writer. [[Daniel Crilly|Dan Crilly]] told me Parnell's first contribution to the ''Liverpool Argus'' (mentioned in my London letter) was not worth much, and though he promised to insert it, he has failed me.\"\n\nO'Connor Power and Parnell were not kindred spirits. Power was an able and eloquent man, \"reeking of the common clay\", at which Parnell's aristocratic sensitiveness recoiled. \"Of their differences I hinted to my brother\":\n\nLondon,<br />\n24 November 1878.<br />\n\"I met O'Connor Power, and he was unaware, until I told him, that his name was down to propose one of the resolutions in Dublin. He expressed disgust, and said he told the Dublin people he would not go over, and that it was only another piece of their cowardice in being afraid to face Butt themselves.\n\nI was aware of the stories told about Power, but what is the use of repeating them? Parnell has been careful to tell me his views about Power (and so has Biggar), but I have defended him to them, and think they should make allowance for his poverty and position. Parnell told Power to his face that he was \"a damned scoundrel,\" and Power made a coarse reply ...\"\n\n<ref>[[T. M. Healy]], [http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/THealy/healy5.htm ''Letters and Leaders of My Day'', Chapter 5].</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Land War==\nHowever, O'Connor Power retained credibility with small tenant farmers and addressed the [[James Daly (Irish Land League)#Leadup to the 20 April 1879 Irishtown Meeting|Tenant-Right Meeting]] at [[Irishtown, County Mayo]] on 20 April 1879, which launched the protest movement that led to the [[Irish National Land League]].<ref name=\"Jordan\">Donald Jordan, \"John O'Connor Power, Charles Stewart Parnell and the centralisation of popular politics in Ireland\", ''Irish Historical Studies'' 25 (1986), 46\u201366.</ref> He was 'the only member of Parliament invited to or who attended the historic Irishtown meeting.'<ref>Davitt, Michael, ''The Fall of Feudalism'', p. 146</ref>\n\nT. M. Healy writes of the Irishtown meeting:\n\n'Power's presence there gave birth to the Land League and made history ... No reporters attended the meeting. Power called on me when he returned to London to give an account of it. From what he said I realised that a new portent had arisen out of a leaden sky. He related that footmen in legions, and horsemen in squadrons, gathered round him to demand reductions of rent. The horsemen, he declared, were organised like cavalry regiments. The police were powerless, and Power foreshadowed that Ireland was on the verge of a movement which would end a dismal chapter. Yet his meeting was unnoted, save by a local weekly ''The Connaught'' ''Telegraph'', owned by James Daly.'<ref>Connaught Telegraph, 21 April 1879, Healy, T. M., Letters and Leaders of My Day, chap. vi.</ref>\n\nWilliam O'Brien recounts:\n\n'The whole countryside had flocked together, as at a word of command, including horsemen enough to form a regiment of cavalry, and Mr. Power, who had sounded all the subterranean depths of Irish disaffection, spoke very solemnly of what was coming. It was the first whisper I heard of the Land League movement, although even the name was not yet invented.'\n\nAfter Parnell and Davitt addressed the follow-up meeting at [[Westport, County Mayo]] on 8 June 1879 they took control of the growing [[Land War]]. [[T. M. Healy]] gives his view of how O'Connor Power was frozen out of the Land League:<ref>[[T. M. Healy]], ''[http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/THealy/healy6.htm ''Letters and Leaders of My Day'', Chapter 6.]</ref>\n<blockquote>\nStirrings of ambition and resentment may have been ingredients in Parnell's action in joining Davitt and cold-shouldering Power, but what can lessen admiration for the pluck with which he threw himself into a movement which involved him and his relatives in danger and loss? His rents in Co. Wicklow and those of his brothers in Armagh and Carlow were at stake.\n\nTowards the close of the session Power wrote me:\n\nHouse of Commons,<br />\n4 August 1879.<br />\nMy Dear Healy,<br />\nFinegan told me you would be down to-night, but I have not been so fortunate as to come across you.\n\nIf you have seen my article in the ''Fortnightly'',<ref>' O'Connor Power, 'Fallacies about Home Rule', ''Fortnightly Review'', Aug. 1879.</ref> I would feel obliged by your noticing it in your letter this week. The cynical ''Saturday Review'' noticed it fairly enough, but I have seen no notice of it in any Irish paper.\"<br />\nEver sincerely,<br />\nJ. O'Connor Power.\n\nI complied, but owing to his strained relations with Parnell and Biggar, he went to Dublin to examine the position, and wrote me:\n\n\"... Davitt met me on my arrival here \u2013 a reception unexpected on my part. He is writing an appeal to the Irish at home and abroad, for funds to carry on the Land agitation, and working hard to abolish the Home Rule League.\n\nI am here just in time for Thursday's meeting, when the Home Rule League will be \"tried for life\" and perhaps condemned. Parnell's resolutions evidently tend in that direction.\"\n\nPower's letter was written from the lodgings of [[Thomas Brennan (Irish Land League)|Tom Brennan]], who three months later, became secretary to the Land League, when Davitt was made its chief organiser, and Parnell (with [[John Dillon|Dillon]]) was accredited envoy to the United States.\n\nPower, who started the movement, was left \"festering outside-the breastworks,\" without control or influence in the new organisation.\n</blockquote>\nIn 'The Irish Land Agitation', published in the ''Nineteenth Century'', December 1879, O'Connor Power writes on the land question, on the cry for land reform and the demands of the Irish National Land League, 'it may be useful for one connected with the movement to lay before English readers a statement explaining its causes, and presenting for serious consideration its aims and hopes and possible results.' The evils of the Irish land system must be urgently addressed and resolved:\n \n'More than three years ago I ventured during a debate in the House of Commons on the Irish land question, to predict that if the proposal then before the House to deprive the landlords of the power of eviction and rack-renting \u2013 that is to say the proposal in favour of fixity of tenure at fair rents \u2013 was not accepted, the Irish people would rise up and protest against the institution of landlordism, root and branch, and demand its abolition.'\n<ref>O'Connor Power, 'The Irish Land Agitation', 964.</ref>\n\nThough originally a friend, Davitt changed his opinion of O'Connor Power, describing him in his 'Jottings In Solitary' of 1881\u20131882 as a \"renegade to former nationalist principles: unscrupulously ambitious and untrustworthy\".<ref name=\"Moody\"/>  When Davitt moved to London he renewed his friendship with O'Connor Power.

There were over seven hundred Nationalists present. He and William O'Brien gave the principal toasts:\n\n'[O'Connor Power believed] no more justifiable insurrection had, in his judgement, taken place in the history of the world than the Irish rebellion of a hundred years ago. A rebel was a patriot who failed \u2013 a patriot was a rebel who succeeded, and he thought he did not misinterpret the spirit of that assembly if he said they were ready to toast the men of '98 in either capacity. He should never cease to be grateful to the United Irishmen, not only because they had bequeathed an example of courageous patriotism, but because they had given them one cardinal principle of high policy, and that was the principle of a united Ireland. He trusted that this memorable year would not be allowed to pass away without renewed efforts being made to restore union in the National Union, at present so unhappily divided.'<ref>Freeman's Journal, 17 March 1898. ' Irish National Banquet'.</ref>\n\nIn June 1916 O'Connor Power forcefully condemned the suspension of Home Rule:\n\n'The suspension of the Home Rule Act was advocated in the name of peace and conciliation, and we know the result. This scheme [partition] is supported on the same ground and will be followed as surely by similar disillusion and disappointment.\nI have read speeches of members of Parliament calling upon the young men of Ireland to go to the front because of the Home Rule Act. The brave young fellows rushed to the recruiting offices in tens of thousands: most of whom now sleep their last sleep in the blood-stained fields of Europe. They did not offer up their lives for a mutilated Ireland but for one united from sea to sea, and they did so with the promise of their leaders that national  unity would never be given away.

As a public orator he aroused the keenest enthusiasm, while in Parliament, he was forceful and eloquent. He was one of the speakers at the Irishtown meeting when the Land League was launched. In Parliament, since 1874, as a supporter of Butt, he was again returned in '80 with Parnell, but the latter convinced that their policies were growing divergent, elected to sit for Cork city, for which he was also returned. Though there was no open rupture, Power and Parnell drifted further apart, and in 1885 the former dropped out, having previously had notable differences with Messrs Parnell, Sexton and Healy.  Since then Power twice unsuccessfully stood for English constituencies as a Radical.  Davitt and he maintained their friendship.  In 1893 Power married the widow of Mr H. F Weiss, FRCS.  One of his books dealt with the art of oratory. He was called to the English Bar in 1881.  The London Evening Standard classes him as an orator with Gladstone and Bright.\n(''[[Irish Independent]], 24 February 1919)\n\n==In literature==\n\n'And three's here for repeat of the unium!

An improperly installed [[windscreen]] panel separated from its frame, causing the plane's captain to be blown partially out of the aircraft. With the captain pinned against the window frame for twenty minutes, the [[First officer (aeronautics)|first officer]] landed at [[Southampton Airport]].\n\n== Incident ==\nThe ''County of South Glamorgan'' was a [[BAC One-Eleven]] Series 528FL jet airliner, registered as {{Airreg|G|BJRT|.}} The captain was 42-year-old Tim Lancaster, who had logged 11,050 flight hours, including 1,075 hours on the BAC One-eleven; the copilot was 39-year-old Alastair Atchison, with 7,500 flight hours, with 1,100 of them on the BAC One-eleven.<ref name=HMSO>{{cite report\n| url=https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/1-1992-bac-one-eleven-g-bjrt-10-june-1990\n| title=Report No: 1/1992.

Both pilots released their shoulder harnesses and Lancaster loosened his lap belt. At 08:33 (07:33 UTC) the plane had climbed through about {{convert|17,300|ft}}<ref name=\"HMSO\" />{{Rp|3}} over [[Didcot]], Oxfordshire, and the cabin crew were preparing for meal service. \n\n[[Flight attendant]] Nigel Ogden was entering the cockpit when there was a loud bang<ref name=SPI>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-sunday-post-inverness/20150705/283412010361332|title=Tributes to the reluctant hero of Flight 5390|website=www.pressreader.com|publisher=The Sunday Post (Inverness)|date=5 July 2015|access-date=26 April 2018}}</ref> and the cabin quickly filled with [[condensation]]. The left [[windscreen]] panel, on Lancaster's side of the flight deck, had separated from the forward fuselage; Lancaster was propelled out of his seat by the rushing air from the [[Uncontrolled decompression|decompression]] and forced head first out of the flight deck. His knees were caught on the flight controls and his upper torso remained outside the aircraft, exposed to extreme wind and cold. The [[autopilot]] had disengaged, causing the plane to descend rapidly.<ref name=SPI/> The flight deck door was blown inward onto the control console, blocking the throttle control (causing the aircraft to gain speed as it descended) and papers and debris blew into the flight deck from the passenger cabin. Ogden rushed to grab Lancaster's belt, while the other two flight attendants secured loose objects, reassured passengers, and instructed them to adopt [[brace position]]s in anticipation of an emergency landing.\n\nThe plane was not equipped with oxygen for everyone on board, so Atchison began a rapid [[Descent (aeronautics)|emergency descent]] to reach an altitude with sufficient air pressure. He then re-engaged the autopilot and broadcast a [[distress call]], but he was unable to hear the response from [[air traffic control]] because of wind noise; the difficulty in establishing two-way communication led to a delay in initiation of emergency procedures.\n<!--BT citation mentions 3 of the 4 cabin crew members: chief steward John Heward and flight attendants Nigel Ogden and Simon Rogers.
