In the 19th&nbsp;century, the city saw a huge expansion of its traditional cutlery trade, when [[stainless steel]] and [[crucible steel]] were developed locally, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population. Sheffield received its [[municipal charter]] in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in these industries in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area.\n\nThe 21st&nbsp;century has seen extensive [[Urban renewal|redevelopment]] in Sheffield, along with other British cities.  Sheffield's [[gross value added]] (GVA) has increased by 60% since 1997, standing at \u00a311.3&nbsp;billion in 2015. The economy has experienced steady growth averaging around 5% annually, greater than that of the broader region of Yorkshire and the Humber.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/sheffield-facts-figures/sheffield-economy/income--wealth \n |title=Income & Wealth \n |date=30 November 2007 \n |publisher=[[Sheffield City Council]] \n |accessdate=7 July 2010 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521085049/http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/sheffield-facts-figures/sheffield-economy/income--wealth \n |archivedate=21 May 2010 \n |url-status=live \n}}</ref>\n\nThe city has a long sporting heritage, and is home to the world's oldest football club, [[Sheffield F.C.]]<ref name=\"celebration\" /> Games between the two professional clubs, [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], are known as the [[Steel City derby]].

In the 19th&nbsp;century, the city saw a huge expansion of its traditional cutlery trade, when [[stainless steel]] and [[crucible steel]] were developed locally, fuelling an almost tenfold increase in the population. Sheffield received its [[municipal charter]] in 1843, becoming the City of Sheffield in 1893. International competition in iron and steel caused a decline in these industries in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the collapse of coal mining in the area.\n\nThe 21st&nbsp;century has seen extensive [[Urban renewal|redevelopment]] in Sheffield, along with other British cities.
