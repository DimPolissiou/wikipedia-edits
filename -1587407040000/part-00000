In 2007, he moved to the United States to film pornography. Between 2007 and 2009, Wiederhold worked with Pratt, the two filming videos of Wiederhold having sex in hotel rooms with women who were not in the porn industry. These videos formed the basis of the videos first released by GirlsDoPorn.

In the opinion of highly respected architect [[John Russell Pope]], there were only three New York firms whose carvings would be \"properly done\". They were Edward Ardolino, John Donnelly, and [[Piccirilli Brothers]].{{sfn|Gurney|1985|page=236}} During this period Ardolino was awarded commissions for four federal buildings. All four reside within a designated historical district. \n\n* The [[Department of Commerce Building]], designed by architects [[York and Sawyer]], was constructed from 1927 to 1932. The modeling firm was Ricci and Zari. Ardolino's carvings include: the eagles along the cornice of the 14th Street fa\u00e7ade, the third floor keystones, four panels at each of four driveway entrances, and eight urns.{{sfn|Gurney|1985|pages=83, 100, 103-104}}\n\n* The [[New Post Office Building|Department of the Post Office]], later called the Federal Building, was designed by [[Delano and Aldrich]] and built between 1931 and 1934. Edward Ardolino company carved the metopes ([[Adolph Alexander Weinman]], sculptor) and keystones (modeled by Ricci Studios).{{sfn|Gurney|1985|pages=126, 131, 146-147}} At the height of the Post office carving in 1933, Ardolino employed at least 36 carvers.{{sfn|Gurney|1985|page=423, footnote 52}}\n\n* The [[Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium|Departmental Auditorium]], designed by architect [[Arthur Brown Jr.]], was constructed from 1931 to 1936. Edward Ardolino company carved the Constitution Avenue pediment \"Columbia\" (Edgar Walter, sculptor) and also the nearby panels in the upper right and left corners behind the columns ([[L\u00e9on Hermant]], sculptor) and the panel and spandrels above the central arch behind the columns ([[Edmond Amateis]], sculptor).{{sfn|Gurney|1985|pages=242, 277-279}}\n\n* The [[National Archives Building]], designed by architect [[John Russell Pope]] in partnership with [[Eggers & Higgins|Otto R. Eggers and Daniel Paul Higgins]], was erected between 1933 and 1935. Ardolino carved the Pennsylvania Avenue pediment \"Destiny\", for sculptor [[Adolph Alexander Weinman]].{{sfn|Gurney|1985|pages=198, 223, 238}}<ref name=\":1\" /> The sculptor approved so strongly of Ardolino's role in executing the pedimental sculpture he invited him to add his name to the limestone pediment.

In the opinion of highly respected architect [[John Russell Pope]], there were only three New York firms whose carvings would be \"properly done\". They were Edward Ardolino, John Donnelly, and [[Piccirilli Brothers]].{{sfn|Gurney|1985|page=236}} During this period Ardolino was awarded commissions for four federal buildings. All four reside within a designated historical district. \n\n* The [[Department of Commerce Building]], designed by architects [[York and Sawyer]], was constructed from 1927 to 1932. The modeling firm was Ricci and Zari. Ardolino's carvings include: the eagles along the cornice of the 14<sup>th</sup> Street fa\u00e7ade, the third floor keystones, four panels at each of four driveway entrances, and eight urns.{{sfn|Gurney|1985|pages=83, 100, 103-104}}\n\n* The [[New Post Office Building|Department of the Post Office]], later called the Federal Building, was designed by [[Delano and Aldrich]] and built between 1931 and 1934. Edward Ardolino company carved the metopes ([[Adolph Alexander Weinman]], sculptor) and keystones (modeled by Ricci Studios).{{sfn|Gurney|1985|pages=126, 131, 146-147}} At the height of the Post office carving in 1933, Ardolino employed at least 36 carvers.{{sfn|Gurney|1985|page=423, footnote 52}}\n\n* The [[Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium|Departmental Auditorium]], designed by architect [[Arthur Brown Jr.]], was constructed from 1931 to 1936. Edward Ardolino company carved the Constitution Avenue pediment \"Columbia\" (Edgar Walter, sculptor) and also the nearby panels in the upper right and left corners behind the columns ([[L\u00e9on Hermant]], sculptor) and the panel and spandrels above the central arch behind the columns ([[Edmond Amateis]], sculptor).{{sfn|Gurney|1985|pages=242, 277-279}}\n\n* The [[National Archives Building]], designed by architect [[John Russell Pope]] in partnership with [[Eggers & Higgins|Otto R.

Ardolino carved the Pennsylvania Avenue pediment \"Destiny\", for sculptor [[Adolph Alexander Weinman]].{{sfn|Gurney|1985|pages=198, 223, 238}}<ref name=\":1\" /> The sculptor approved so strongly of Ardolino's role in executing the pedimental sculpture he invited him to add his name to the limestone pediment.

The first notable suggestion came from Kyle Sullivan of [[Lumberton, Mississippi]], USA, whose mnemonic was published in the Jan. 2007 issue of Astronomy magazine: '''\"My Violent Evil Monster Just Scared Us Nuts\"'''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Physics 110 Astronomy Mnemonics |publisher=www.csub.edu/Physics |url=http://www.csub.edu/Physics/phys110/Mnemonics.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118062722/http://www.csub.edu/Physics/phys110/Mnemonics.html |archivedate=2012-01-18 }}</ref> In August 2006, for the eight planets recognized under the new definition,<ref>{{Cite web|title = International Astronomical Union, iau0603 -- Press Release, IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes, 24 August 2006|url = http://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau0603/|website = |access-date = 2016-01-30}}</ref> Phyllis Lugger, professor of astronomy at Indiana University suggested the following modification to the common mnemonic for the nine planets: '''\"My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos\"'''. She proposed this mnemonic to [[Owen Gingerich]], Chair of the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) Planet Definition Committee and published the mnemonic in the [[American Astronomical Society]] Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy Bulletin Board on August 25, 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.aas.org/cswa/bulletin.board/2006/08.25.06.html|title = American Astronomical Society Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy Bulletin Board, August 25, 2006|date = |access-date = 2016-01-30|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> It also appeared in Indiana University's IU News Room Star Trak on August 30, 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news-archive/3955.html|title = Indiana University, IU News Room, Star Trak, August 30, 2006|date = |access-date = 2016-01-30|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> This mnemonic is used by the IAU on their website for the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.iau.org/public/themes/pluto/|title = Pluto and the Developing Landscape of Our Solar System, Questions and Answers|date = |access-date = 2016-01-30|website = International Astronomical Union, IAU for the Public|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Others angry at the IAU's decision to \"demote\" Pluto composed sarcastic mnemonics in protest.

On February 22, 2008, '''\"My Very Exciting Magic Carpet Just Sailed Under Nine Palace Elephants\"''', coined by 10-year-old Maryn Smith of [[Great Falls, Montana]], was announced as the winner.<ref name=\"ngc080229\">{{cite web |url=http://press.nationalgeographic.com/pressroom/index.jsp?pageID=pressReleases_detail&siteID=1&cid=1203698789748 |title=National Geographic Children's Books Announces Winner of New Planetary Mnemonic |accessdate=2008-02-29 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306035112/http://press.nationalgeographic.com/pressroom/index.jsp?pageID=pressReleases_detail&siteID=1&cid=1203698789748 |archivedate=March 6, 2008 }}</ref> The phrase was featured in the song ''11 Planets'' by [[Grammy Award|Grammy-nominated]] singer and songwriter [[Lisa Loeb]] and in the book ''11 Planets: A New View of the Solar System'' by David Aguilar ({{ISBN|978-1426302367}}).<ref name=\"ngk080923\">{{cite web| url=http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/Stories/SpaceScience/Planet-song| title=Planet Song| publisher=Kids.NationalGeographic.com| accessdate=2008-09-23}} (The song may be heard on-line.)</ref>\n\n==Thirteen planets and dwarf planets==\nSince the National Geographic competition, two additional bodies were designated as dwarf planets, [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]] and [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]], on July 11 and September 17, 2008 respectively.  A 2015 New York Times article suggested some mnemonics including, '''\"My Very Educated Mother Cannot Just Serve Us Nine Pizzas\u2014Hundreds May Eat!\"'''<ref name=\"MyUser_The_New_York_Times_June_20_2015c\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/science/a-new-planet-mnemonic-pluto-dwarf-planets.html?_r=0 |title=My Very Educated Readers, Please Write Us a New Planet Mnemonic |newspaper=The New York Times |date= January 20, 2015 |author= |accessdate= June 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nLonger mnemonics will be required in the future, if more of the [[list of possible dwarf planets|possible dwarf planets]] are recognized as such by the IAU.  However, at some point enthusiasm for new mnemonics will wane as the number of dwarf planets exceeds the number that people will want to learn.  (It is estimated that there may be 200 dwarf planets.)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Science mnemonics}}\n{{Solar System}}\n\n[[Category:Science mnemonics]]\n[[Category:Planets of the Solar System|Mnemonic]]\n[[Category:Pluto's planethood|Mnemonic]]\n[[Category:Definition of planet|Mnemonic]]\n", "name_user": "71.95.243.168", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eEight planets)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_mnemonic"}
