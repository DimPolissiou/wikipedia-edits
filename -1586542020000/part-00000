Chambers (1827\u20131911), a corporate and bankruptcy lawyer, and Caroline Smith Boughton (1842\u20131913). His parents met when Caroline was twelve years old and William P. was interning with her father, Joseph Boughton, a prominent corporate lawyer. Eventually the two formed the law firm of Chambers and Boughton which continued to prosper even after Joseph's death in 1861. Robert's great-grandfather, William Chambers (birth unknown), a lieutenant in the British [[Royal Navy]], was married to Amelia Saunders (1765\u20131822), the great granddaughter of [[Tobias Saunders]] of Westerly, Rhode Island. The couple moved from Westerly to Greenfield, Massachusetts and then to Galway, New York, where their son, also William Chambers (1798\u20131874), was born. The second William graduated from Union College at the age of 18, and then went to a college in Boston, where he studied to be a doctor. Upon graduating, he and his wife, Eliza P. Allen (1793\u20131880), a direct descendant of [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]],<ref name=\":0\" /> the founder of Providence, Rhode Island were among the first settlers of Broadalbin, New York. His brother was architect [[Walter B. Chambers|Walter Boughton Chambers]].\n\nRobert was first educated at the [[Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute]], and then entered the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students' League]] at around the age of 20, where the artist [[Charles Dana Gibson]] was his fellow student. Chambers studied at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]], and at [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]], in Paris from 1886 to 1893, and his work was displayed at the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] as early as 1889. On his return to New York, he succeeded in selling his illustrations to ''Life'', ''[[Truth (magazine)|Truth]]'', and ''Vogue'' magazines. Then, for reasons unclear, he devoted his time to writing, producing his first novel, ''[[In the Quarter]]'' (written in 1887 in Munich). His most famous, and perhaps most meritorious, effort is ''[[The King in Yellow]]'', a collection of Art Nouveau short stories published in 1895. This included several famous [[weird tale|weird]] short stories which are connected by the theme of a fictitious drama of the same title, which drives those who read it insane.<ref name=\"survey\">[[Brian Stableford]], \"The King in Yellow\" in Frank N.

These novels were ''The Red Republic'' (1895, centring on the [[Paris Commune]]), ''Lorraine'' (1898), and ''Ashes of Empire'' (1898).<ref>Albert Boime, \"Olin Levi Warner's Defense of the Paris Commune\", ''Archives of American Art Journal'', Vol. 29, No. 3/4 (1989), (pp. 4, 13).</ref><ref name=\"jn\">Nield, Jonathan (1925), ''A Guide to the Best Historical Novels and Tales''. G. P.

According to some estimates, Chambers had one of the most successful literary careers of his period, his later novels selling well and a handful achieving best-seller status. Many of his works were also serialised in magazines.\n\nHis novel ''The Man They Hanged'' was about [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], and argued that Kidd was not a pirate but had been made a scapegoat by the British government.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring World War I, he wrote war adventure novels and war stories, some of which showed a strong return to his old weird style, such as \"Marooned\" in ''Barbarians'' (1917). After 1924 he devoted himself solely to writing historical fiction.\n\nChambers for several years made [[Broadalbin (village), New York|Broadalbin, New York]], his summer home. Some of his novels touch upon colonial life in Broadalbin and Johnstown.\n\nOn July 12, 1898, he married Elsa (Elsie) Vaughn Moller (1872\u20131939). They had a son, Robert Edward Stuart Chambers (1899\u20131955) (who sometimes used the name Robert Husted Chambers).\n\nRobert W. Chambers died on December 16, 1933, after having undergone intestinal surgery three days earlier.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|title = Robert Chambers, Novelist, Is Dead|date = 17 December 1933|work = New York Times|page = 36}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism and legacy==\n[[H.P.

August Derleth and Donald Wandrei (Arkham House, 1968), p. 148.</ref>}}\n\nDespite Chambers' effective later abandonment of the weird supernatural tale, these early works are all that remained in print through most of the twentieth century, thanks to Lovecraft's inclusion of them in the critical study \"[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]\".\n\n[[Frederic Taber Cooper]] commented:\n\n{{bquote|So much of Mr Chambers's work exasperates, because we feel that he might so easily have made it better.\"<ref>Cooper, ''Some American Story Tellers'' (Henry Holt, 1911), p.81.

These novels were ''The Red Republic'' (1895, centring on the [[Paris Commune]]), ''Lorraine'' (1898), and ''Ashes of Empire'' (1898).<ref>Albert Boime, \"Olin Levi Warner's Defense of the Paris Commune\", ''Archives of American Art Journal'', Vol. 29, No. 3/4 (1989), (pp. 4, 13).</ref><ref name=\"jn\">Nield, Jonathan (1925), ''A Guide to the Best Historical Novels and Tales''.

According to some estimates, Chambers had one of the most successful literary careers of his period, his later novels selling well and a handful achieving best-seller status. Many of his works were also serialised in magazines.\n\nHis novel ''The Man They Hanged'' was about [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], and argued that Kidd was not a pirate but had been made a scapegoat by the British government.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring World War I, he wrote war adventure novels and war stories, some of which showed a strong return to his old weird style, such as \"Marooned\" in ''Barbarians'' (1917). After 1924 he devoted himself solely to writing historical fiction.\n\nChambers for several years made [[Broadalbin (village), New York|Broadalbin, New York]], his summer home. Some of his novels touch upon colonial life in Broadalbin and Johnstown.\n\nOn July 12, 1898, he married Elsa (Elsie) Vaughn Moller (1872\u20131939). They had a son, Robert Edward Stuart Chambers (1899\u20131955) (who sometimes used the name Robert Husted Chambers).\n\nRobert W. Chambers died on December 16, 1933, after having undergone intestinal surgery three days earlier.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|title = Robert Chambers, Novelist, Is Dead|date = 17 December 1933|work = New York Times|page = 36}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism and legacy==\n[[H.P.

At one of the Mont Pelerin meetings, Machlup gave a talk in which I think he questioned the idea of a [[gold standard]]; he came out in favor of [[floating exchange rates]].

The club enjoyed greatest prominence between 1979 and 1983 when they played in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and reached the [[1983 FA Cup Final]], losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] after a replay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1983.htm|title=1983 FA Cup Final|publisher=Fa-CupFinals.co.uk|accessdate=6 September 2011}}</ref> They were relegated from the First Division in the same season.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Brighton was in the fourth tier of English football and were having financial difficulties. After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League to the [[National League (English football)|Conference]] in 1997, a boardroom takeover saved the club from liquidation. Successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotions]] in 2001 and 2002 brought Brighton back to the second tier, and in 2011, the club moved into the Falmer Stadium after 14 years without a permanent home ground. In the [[2016\u201317 EFL Championship|2016\u201317 season]], Brighton finished second in the [[EFL Championship]] and were thus promoted to the Premier League, ending a 34-year absence from the top flight.\n\n==History==\n{{recentism|date=May 2018}}\n{{main|History of Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.}}\n[[File:Dick Knight - Falmer opening.jpg|thumb|right|Former Brighton chairman [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] who ultimately saved the club]]\n===Formation and early years (1901\u20131972)===\nBrighton & Hove Albion F.C. were founded in 1901 and 19 years later, in 1920, they were elected to [[the Football League]]'s new [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] \u2013 having previously been members of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. In the Southern League they won their only national honour to date, the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]], which at that time was contested by the champions of the Southern League, and the Football League, by defeating Football League Champions [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/brighton_and_hove_albion_history.html Brighton & Hove Albion] ''Talk Football''. Retrieved 9 August 2011</ref>\n\n===Mike Bamber years (1972\u20131987)===\nMike Bamber was the chairman of Brighton from October 1972 until 1983. He famously brought [[Brian Clough]] to the club in 1973 and later appointed former England player [[Alan Mullery]] as manager. Brighton's life as a [[the Football League|Football League]] club had brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when, under Mullery's management, they were [[Promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] as [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[runners-up]]. The 1982/83 season saw a wildly inconsistent start for the club, with victories over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] mixed in with heavy defeats. Manager Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982. [[Jimmy Melia]] took over as manager, but was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton, after four seasons in the top flight, were relegated in 1983, finishing in last place.\n\nDespite their relegation, that season Brighton reached their first (and only to date) [[FA Cup]] final and drew 2\u20132 with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the first match. Brighton's goals were scored by [[Gordon Smith (footballer born December 1954)|Gordon Smith]] and [[Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1962)|Gary Stevens]]. The final featured an infamous \"miss\" by Gordon Smith with virtually the last kick of the game in extra time, prompting the [[BBC]] commentator Peter Jones to utter the well-known phrase \"...and Smith must score\".  However, Smith's kick was saved by the Manchester United goalkeeper, [[Gary Bailey]]. In the replay, Manchester United won 4\u20130.\n\n===Brief revival, relegation and last years at the Goldstone (1987\u20131997)===\nAfter four seasons, relegation to Division Three came in 1987, but the Albion bounced back the next season. In 1991 they lost the play-off final at Wembley to Notts County 3\u20131, only to be relegated the next season to the newly named Division Two. In 1996 further relegation came to Division Three. The club's financial situation was becoming increasingly precarious, and the club's directors decided that the [[Goldstone Ground]] would have to be sold to pay off some of the club's huge debts. Manager [[Jimmy Case]] was sacked after a very poor start to the 1996\u201397 season saw Brighton stuck at the bottom of the league by a considerable margin. The club's directors appointed a relative unknown in [[Steve Gritt]], the former joint manager of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. Brighton's league form steadily improved under Gritt, although their improving chances of survival were put under further threat by a two-point deduction imposed as punishment for a pitch invasion by fans who were protesting against the sale of the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] ground. A lifelong fan named [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] took control of the club in 1997 having led the fan pressure to oust the previous board following their sale of the club's Goldstone Ground to property developers.\n\nBy the last day of the season, after being 13 points adrift at one stage, they were off the bottom of the table and had to play the team directly below them, [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] \u2013 the game was in their hands. If Brighton won or drew, they would be safe. Brighton defender [[Kerry Mayo]] scored an own goal in the first half and it looked as though their 77-year league career was over. But a late goal from [[Robbie Reinelt]] ensured that Brighton retained their league status on goals scored (despite Hereford having a better goal difference as, in the Football League at the time, goals scored took precedence), and Hereford's 25-year league run was instead over.\n\n===Ups and Downs and takeover (1997\u20132011)===\nThe sale of the Goldstone Ground went through in 1997, leading to Brighton having to play some 70 miles away at Gillingham's [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] stadium for two seasons. [[Micky Adams]] was appointed Brighton's manager in 1999. For the start of the 1999\u20132000 season the Seagulls secured a lease to play home games at [[Withdean Stadium]], a converted athletics track in Brighton owned by the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local council]]. 2000\u201301 was Brighton's first successful season for 13 years. They were crowned champions of [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] and promoted to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. Adams left in October 2001 to work as [[Dave Bassett]]'s assistant at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]], being replaced by former Leicester manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]]. The transition proved to be a plus point for Brighton, who maintained their good form and ended the season as [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] champions \u2013 winning a second successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]]. Just five years after almost succumbing to the double threat of losing their [[the Football League|Football League]] status and going out of business completely, Brighton were one division away from the [[Premier League]].\n\nIn May 2009, Knight was replaced as chairman at Brighton by [[Tony Bloom]], who successfully secured \u00a393&nbsp;million funding for the new [[Falmer Stadium]] and 75% shareholding at the club.<ref>[http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0,,10433~1661154,00.html Stadium Funding Secured] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522111808/http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0%2C%2C10433~1661154%2C00.html |date=22 May 2009 }}, Brighton & Hove Albion F.C., 18 May 2009.

The following season, Brighton changed their crest to a design similar to the crest used from the 1970s to the 1990s. This was to reflect on the club returning home after not having a stadium since 1997.\n\n===Move to new stadium and promotion under Hughton (2011\u20132017)===\nThe [[Falmer Stadium]] hosted its first league match on the opening day of the 2011\u201312 season against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]], who were the last opposition to play at the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] in 1997. The game finished 2\u20131 to Albion. The 2012\u201313 season saw Brighton finish 4th and lose in the play-off semi-finals to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. Poyet was suspended as manager following controversial comments made in his post-match interview,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brighton-hove-albion/10062910/Brighton-and-Hove-Albion-suspend-manager-Gus-Poyet-for-an-alleged-breach-of-contract.html|title=Brighton & Hove Albion suspend manager Gus Poyet for an alleged breach of contract|journal=Daily Telegraph|last=Percy|first=John|date=2013-05-16|access-date=2019-08-03|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> and was later sacked as manager and replaced by [[Oscar Garcia Junyent|Oscar Garcia]].\n\nOn the final day of the 2013\u201314 season, Brighton beat [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] 2\u20131 with a last minute winner from [[Leonardo Ulloa]] to secure a 6th-place finish. After losing to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in the play-offs semi-finals, Garc\u00eda resigned. Ex-Liverpool defender [[Sami Hyypi\u00e4]] was appointed manager for the 2014\u201315 season but resigned after four months and was replaced by former Norwich manager [[Chris Hughton]]. In the following campaign Brighton went on a 22-game unbeaten run from the opening day to 19 December when they lost 3\u20130 at home to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. On the final day of the season Brighton travelled to Middlesbrough and needed to win to secure promotion to the [[Premier League]], but a 1\u20131 draw meant 3rd and a play-off place, where defeat to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] was Brighton's third playoff semi-final defeat in four seasons.\n\nBrighton started 2016\u201317 with an 18-match unbeaten run, taking them to the top of the league for much of December and January. They remained in the automatic promotion positions for most of the rest of the season, and clinched promotion to the Premier League after a 2\u20131 win against Wigan Athletic at home on 17 April 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39549523|title=Brighton 2\u20131 Wigan|work=BBC Sport|date=17 April 2017}}</ref> They broke their transfer record multiple times throughout the summer window, with the previous club record signing of [[Jos\u00e9 Heriberto Izquierdo Mena|Jose Izquierdo]] commanding a fee reported to be over \u00a313&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40885839|title=Jose Izquierdo: Brighton sign Colombian winger in club record deal|work=BBC Sport|date=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Back in the top flight (2017\u2013present)===\nBrighton's first season back in the [[Premier League]] was largely successful, with the club rising into the top half several times in the season. Despite falling to one point above the relegation zone in January, victories over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the final months of the campaign helped secure a finish of 15th.\n\nBrighton\u2019s second season in the [[Premier League]] was inconsistent. Despite a promising start, the team had a disastrous second half of the season, achieving just 3 wins in their last 18 games. In the FA Cup, Brighton reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1983, losing 1-0 to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Albion ultimately survived relegation with a 17th place finish, but Hughton was sacked following the end of the season due to the poor run of results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11718928/chris-hughton-sacked-by-brighton|title=Chris Hughton sacked by Brighton after four-and-a-half years as manager|website=Sky Sports}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Hughton's sacking, Swansea manager [[Graham Potter]] was appointed as the new manager on a four year contract.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48340989|title=Graham Potter appointed new Brighton manager after leaving Swansea|date=20 May 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC Sport}}</ref>.

The board of directors paid \u00a37&nbsp;million of this; the other \u00a32.5&nbsp;million had to be raised from the operations of the club. In an effort to achieve this, a fund-raising appeal known as the ''Alive and Kicking Fund'' was started, with everything from nude [[Christmas Card]]s featuring the players to a CD single being released to raise cash. On 9 January 2005 this fund-raising single '[[Tom Hark (We Want Falmer)|Tom Hark]]' went straight in at number 17 in the UK chart, gaining it national airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4160559.stm|title=Brighton fans single makes top 20|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=10 January 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Falmer Stadium===\n[[File:Falmer Stadium - League debut 2.jpg|thumb|Brighton fans at [[Falmer Stadium]] during the first league game at the stadium against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]]]\n\n'''[[Falmer Stadium]]''' (currently known for sponsorship reasons as '''American Express Community Stadium''', '''Amex Stadium''') is a stadium located in Village Way, Brighton BN1 9BL.\n\nOn 28 October 2005, the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] announced that the application for Falmer had been successful, much to the joy and relief of all the fans. [[Lewes (district)|Lewes District Council]] contested [[John Prescott]]'s decision to approve planning permission for Falmer, forcing a [[judicial review]]. This was based on a minor error in Prescott's original approval which neglected to state that some car parking for the stadium is in the Lewes district as opposed to the Brighton & Hove unitary authority. This caused further delay. Once the judicial review ruled in favour of the stadium, Lewes District Council said that it would not launch any further appeals.\n\nBuilding of [[Falmer Stadium]] started in December 2008.

They compete in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of the [[English football league system]]. The club's home ground is the 30,750-capacity<ref name=\"auto\"/> [[Falmer Stadium]], situated in [[Falmer]] to the north east of the city.\n\nFounded in 1901, and nicknamed the \"Seagulls\" or \"[[Albion]]\", Brighton played their early professional football in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], before being elected to the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1920. The club enjoyed greatest prominence between 1979 and 1983 when they played in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and reached the [[1983 FA Cup Final]], losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] after a replay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1983.htm|title=1983 FA Cup Final|publisher=Fa-CupFinals.co.uk|accessdate=6 September 2011}}</ref> They were relegated from the First Division in the same season.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Brighton was in the fourth tier of English football and were having financial difficulties. After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League to the [[National League (English football)|Conference]] in 1997, a boardroom takeover saved the club from liquidation. Successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotions]] in 2001 and 2002 brought Brighton back to the second tier, and in 2011, the club moved into the Falmer Stadium after 14 years without a permanent home ground. In the [[2016\u201317 EFL Championship|2016\u201317 season]], Brighton finished second in the [[EFL Championship]] and were thus promoted to the Premier League, ending a 34-year absence from the top flight.\n\n==History==\n{{recentism|date=May 2018}}\n{{main|History of Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.}}\n[[File:Dick Knight - Falmer opening.jpg|thumb|right|Former Brighton chairman [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] who ultimately saved the club]]\n===Formation and early years (1901\u20131972)===\nBrighton & Hove Albion F.C. were founded in 1901 and 19 years later, in 1920, they were elected to [[the Football League]]'s new [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] \u2013 having previously been members of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. In the Southern League they won their only national honour to date, the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]], which at that time was contested by the champions of the Southern League, and the Football League, by defeating Football League Champions [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/brighton_and_hove_albion_history.html Brighton & Hove Albion] ''Talk Football''. Retrieved 9 August 2011</ref>\n\n===Mike Bamber years (1972\u20131987)===\nMike Bamber was the chairman of Brighton from October 1972 until 1983. He famously brought [[Brian Clough]] to the club in 1973 and later appointed former England player [[Alan Mullery]] as manager. Brighton's life as a [[the Football League|Football League]] club had brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when, under Mullery's management, they were [[Promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] as [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[runners-up]]. The 1982/83 season saw a wildly inconsistent start for the club, with victories over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] mixed in with heavy defeats. Manager Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982. [[Jimmy Melia]] took over as manager, but was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton, after four seasons in the top flight, were relegated in 1983, finishing in last place.\n\nDespite their relegation, that season Brighton reached their first (and only to date) [[FA Cup]] final and drew 2\u20132 with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the first match. Brighton's goals were scored by [[Gordon Smith (footballer born December 1954)|Gordon Smith]] and [[Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1962)|Gary Stevens]]. The final featured an infamous \"miss\" by Gordon Smith with virtually the last kick of the game in extra time, prompting the [[BBC]] commentator Peter Jones to utter the well-known phrase \"...and Smith must score\".  However, Smith's kick was saved by the Manchester United goalkeeper, [[Gary Bailey]]. In the replay, Manchester United won 4\u20130.\n\n===Brief revival, relegation and last years at the Goldstone (1987\u20131997)===\nAfter four seasons, relegation to Division Three came in 1987, but the Albion bounced back the next season. In 1991 they lost the play-off final at Wembley to Notts County 3\u20131, only to be relegated the next season to the newly named Division Two. In 1996 further relegation came to Division Three. The club's financial situation was becoming increasingly precarious, and the club's directors decided that the [[Goldstone Ground]] would have to be sold to pay off some of the club's huge debts. Manager [[Jimmy Case]] was sacked after a very poor start to the 1996\u201397 season saw Brighton stuck at the bottom of the league by a considerable margin. The club's directors appointed a relative unknown in [[Steve Gritt]], the former joint manager of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. Brighton's league form steadily improved under Gritt, although their improving chances of survival were put under further threat by a two-point deduction imposed as punishment for a pitch invasion by fans who were protesting against the sale of the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] ground. A lifelong fan named [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] took control of the club in 1997 having led the fan pressure to oust the previous board following their sale of the club's Goldstone Ground to property developers.\n\nBy the last day of the season, after being 13 points adrift at one stage, they were off the bottom of the table and had to play the team directly below them, [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] \u2013 the game was in their hands. If Brighton won or drew, they would be safe. Brighton defender [[Kerry Mayo]] scored an own goal in the first half and it looked as though their 77-year league career was over. But a late goal from [[Robbie Reinelt]] ensured that Brighton retained their league status on goals scored (despite Hereford having a better goal difference as, in the Football League at the time, goals scored took precedence), and Hereford's 25-year league run was instead over.\n\n===Ups and Downs and takeover (1997\u20132011)===\nThe sale of the Goldstone Ground went through in 1997, leading to Brighton having to play some 70 miles away at Gillingham's [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] stadium for two seasons. [[Micky Adams]] was appointed Brighton's manager in 1999. For the start of the 1999\u20132000 season the Seagulls secured a lease to play home games at [[Withdean Stadium]], a converted athletics track in Brighton owned by the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local council]]. 2000\u201301 was Brighton's first successful season for 13 years. They were crowned champions of [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] and promoted to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. Adams left in October 2001 to work as [[Dave Bassett]]'s assistant at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]], being replaced by former Leicester manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]]. The transition proved to be a plus point for Brighton, who maintained their good form and ended the season as [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] champions \u2013 winning a second successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]]. Just five years after almost succumbing to the double threat of losing their [[the Football League|Football League]] status and going out of business completely, Brighton were one division away from the [[Premier League]].\n\nIn May 2009, Knight was replaced as chairman at Brighton by [[Tony Bloom]], who successfully secured \u00a393&nbsp;million funding for the new [[Falmer Stadium]] and 75% shareholding at the club.<ref>[http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0,,10433~1661154,00.html Stadium Funding Secured] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522111808/http://www.seagulls.co.uk/page/Latest/0%2C%2C10433~1661154%2C00.html |date=22 May 2009 }}, Brighton & Hove Albion F.C., 18 May 2009.

The following season, Brighton changed their crest to a design similar to the crest used from the 1970s to the 1990s. This was to reflect on the club returning home after not having a stadium since 1997.\n\n===Move to new stadium and promotion under Hughton (2011\u20132017)===\nThe [[Falmer Stadium]] hosted its first league match on the opening day of the 2011\u201312 season against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]], who were the last opposition to play at the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] in 1997. The game finished 2\u20131 to Albion. The 2012\u201313 season saw Brighton finish 4th and lose in the play-off semi-finals to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. Poyet was suspended as manager following controversial comments made in his post-match interview,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/brighton-hove-albion/10062910/Brighton-and-Hove-Albion-suspend-manager-Gus-Poyet-for-an-alleged-breach-of-contract.html|title=Brighton & Hove Albion suspend manager Gus Poyet for an alleged breach of contract|journal=Daily Telegraph|last=Percy|first=John|date=2013-05-16|access-date=2019-08-03|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> and was later sacked as manager and replaced by [[Oscar Garcia Junyent|Oscar Garcia]].\n\nOn the final day of the 2013\u201314 season, Brighton beat [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] 2\u20131 with a last minute winner from [[Leonardo Ulloa]] to secure a 6th-place finish. After losing to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] in the play-offs semi-finals, Garc\u00eda resigned. Ex-Liverpool defender [[Sami Hyypi\u00e4]] was appointed manager for the 2014\u201315 season but resigned after four months and was replaced by former Norwich manager [[Chris Hughton]]. In the following campaign Brighton went on a 22-game unbeaten run from the opening day to 19 December when they lost 3\u20130 at home to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. On the final day of the season Brighton travelled to Middlesbrough and needed to win to secure promotion to the [[Premier League]], but a 1\u20131 draw meant 3rd and a play-off place, where defeat to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] was Brighton's third playoff semi-final defeat in four seasons.\n\nBrighton started 2016\u201317 with an 18-match unbeaten run, taking them to the top of the league for much of December and January. They remained in the automatic promotion positions for most of the rest of the season, and clinched promotion to the Premier League after a 2\u20131 win against Wigan Athletic at home on 17 April 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39549523|title=Brighton 2\u20131 Wigan|work=BBC Sport|date=17 April 2017}}</ref> They broke their transfer record multiple times throughout the summer window, with the previous club record signing of [[Jos\u00e9 Heriberto Izquierdo Mena|Jose Izquierdo]] commanding a fee reported to be over \u00a313&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40885839|title=Jose Izquierdo: Brighton sign Colombian winger in club record deal|work=BBC Sport|date=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Back in the top flight (2017\u2013present)===\nBrighton's first season back in the [[Premier League]] was largely successful, with the club rising into the top half several times in the season. Despite falling to one point above the relegation zone in January, victories over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the final months of the campaign helped secure a finish of 15th.\n\nBrighton\u2019s second season in the [[Premier League]] was inconsistent. Despite a promising start, the team had a disastrous second half of the season, achieving just 3 wins in their last 18 games. In the FA Cup, Brighton reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1983, losing 1-0 to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Albion ultimately survived relegation with a 17th place finish, but Hughton was sacked following the end of the season due to the poor run of results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11718928/chris-hughton-sacked-by-brighton|title=Chris Hughton sacked by Brighton after four-and-a-half years as manager|website=Sky Sports}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Hughton's sacking, Swansea manager [[Graham Potter]] was appointed as the new manager on a four year contract.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48340989|title=Graham Potter appointed new Brighton manager after leaving Swansea|date=20 May 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC Sport}}</ref>.

The board of directors paid \u00a37&nbsp;million of this; the other \u00a32.5&nbsp;million had to be raised from the operations of the club. In an effort to achieve this, a fund-raising appeal known as the ''Alive and Kicking Fund'' was started, with everything from nude [[Christmas Card]]s featuring the players to a CD single being released to raise cash. On 9 January 2005 this fund-raising single '[[Tom Hark (We Want Falmer)|Tom Hark]]' went straight in at number 17 in the UK chart, gaining it national airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4160559.stm|title=Brighton fans single makes top 20|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=10 January 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Falmer Stadium===\n[[File:Falmer Stadium - League debut 2.jpg|thumb|Brighton fans at [[Falmer Stadium]] during the first league game at the stadium against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]]]\n\n'''[[Falmer Stadium]]''' (currently known for sponsorship reasons as '''American Express Community Stadium''', '''Amex Stadium''') is a stadium located in Village Way, Brighton BN1 9BL.\n\nOn 28 October 2005, the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] announced that the application for Falmer had been successful, much to the joy and relief of all the fans. [[Lewes (district)|Lewes District Council]] contested [[John Prescott]]'s decision to approve planning permission for Falmer, forcing a [[judicial review]]. This was based on a minor error in Prescott's original approval which neglected to state that some car parking for the stadium is in the Lewes district as opposed to the Brighton & Hove unitary authority. This caused further delay. Once the judicial review ruled in favour of the stadium, Lewes District Council said that it would not launch any further appeals.\n\nBuilding of [[Falmer Stadium]] started in December 2008. On 31 May 2011 the club officially completed the handover and was given the keys to the stadium with an initial capacity of 22,374 seats, signifying the end of 12 years without a home. During January 2012, the club submitted an application to Brighton and Hove City council to increase the stadium capacity by a further 8,000 seats as well as to add additional corporate boxes, new television facilities and a luxury suite.<ref name=expansionjan12>{{cite news| url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/9446804.Albion_s___36_million_plans_to_push_for_Premiership/ |title=Albion's \u00a336&nbsp;million plans to push for Premiership |accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=The Argus|date=2 January 2012}}</ref> This was granted unanimously by Brighton & Hove City Council's planning committee on 25 April 2012.

At the age of 13, he lost sight in one of his eyes, but notwithstanding his disability, he was appointed a company commander of the ''[[Jinshotai]]'', a Tosa-Domain [[Shock troops|shock force]], during the [[Boshin War]] of the [[Meiji Restoration]], participating in the [[Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi]], and in subsequent campaigns in northern Japan against the pro-Tokugawa [[\u014cuetsu Reppan D\u014dmei]]. During the course of the conflict, he was promoted to company commander, and awarded a stipend of 150 ''[[koku]]''.\n\nAfter the war, Yamaji went to [[Tokyo]], and was appointed by the [[Meiji government]] as a [[lieutenant colonel]] in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army. During the ''[[Seikanron]]'' debate, he supported his fellow Tosa clansmen [[Itagaki Taisuke]] and [[Got\u014d Sh\u014djir\u014d]], at one point resigning his commission and returning to Tosa to participate in the [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]], but eventually he had a falling out with Itagaki and returned to military service, receiving a position with the [[Imperial Guard of Japan|Guards Division]]. \n\nDuring the [[Satsuma Rebellion]] Yamaji commanded the [[4th Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 4th Infantry Regiment]] from March to October 1877, served as chief of staff of the IJA 3rd Infantry Brigade and subsequently commanded the IJA 3rd Infantry Regiment and IJA 12th Infantry Regiment. \n\n===As general===\nYamaji was promoted to the rank of [[major general]] in February 1881, and commander of the Kumamoto Garrison. He subsequently served as commander of the Osaka Garrison, IJA 2nd Infantry Brigade, Kumamoto Garrison (second term), and was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in December 1886. In May 1887, he was elevated to the title of [[baron]] (''danshaku'') in the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system by [[Emperor Meiji]].\n\nIn May 1888, with the reorganization of the Imperial Japanese Army into [[Division (army)|divisions]] per the advice of [[Prussia]]n [[O-yatoi gaikokujin|military advisor]] [[Jakob Meckel]], Yamaji was made commander of the new [[6th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 6th Division]], and later of the [[1st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 1st Division]]. \n\nDuring the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], he saw combat at the [[Jinzhou District|Battle of Jinzhou]] and later at the [[Battle of Lushunkou]]. After the fall of Lushunkou, soldiers under his command were accused of the [[Port Arthur massacre (China)|Port Arthur massacre]] by [[yellow journalism| yellow journalist]] [[James Creelman]] in a widely circulated account with blemished Japan's previous good reputation for its conduct in the war.<ref>{{cite book | last = Paine | first = S.

A movement to purchase the monument by the citizens of K\u014dchi failed to raise the needed funds, and the monument is now used as an ornamental stone bridge in the [[Japanese garden]] of the head office of the Seikad\u014d company in Tokyo.

During the course of the conflict, he was promoted to company commander, and awarded a stipend of 150 ''[[koku]]''.\n\nAfter the war, Yamaji went to [[Tokyo]], and was appointed by the [[Meiji government]] as a [[lieutenant colonel]] in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army. During the ''[[Seikanron]]'' debate, he supported his fellow Tosa clansmen [[Itagaki Taisuke]] and [[Got\u014d Sh\u014djir\u014d]], at one point resigning his commission and returning to Tosa to participate in the [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]], but eventually he had a falling out with Itagaki and returned to military service, receiving a position with the [[Imperial Guard of Japan|Guards Division]]. \n\nDuring the [[Satsuma Rebellion]] Yamaji commanded the [[4th Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 4th Infantry Regiment]] from March to October 1877, served as chief of staff of the IJA 3rd Infantry Brigade and subsequently commanded the IJA 3rd Infantry Regiment and IJA 12th Infantry Regiment. \n\n===As general===\nYamaji was promoted to the rank of [[major general]] in February 1881, and commander of the Kumamoto Garrison. He subsequently served as commander of the Osaka Garrison, IJA 2nd Infantry Brigade, Kumamoto Garrison (second term), and was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in December 1886. In May 1887, he was elevated to the title of [[baron]] (''danshaku'') in the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system by [[Emperor Meiji]].\n\nIn May 1888, with the reorganization of the Imperial Japanese Army into [[Division (army)|divisions]] per the advice of [[Prussia]]n [[O-yatoi gaikokujin|military advisor]] [[Jakob Meckel]], Yamaji was made commander of the new [[6th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 6th Division]], and later of the [[1st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 1st Division]]. \n\nDuring the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], he saw combat at the [[Jinzhou District|Battle of Jinzhou]] and later at the [[Battle of Lushunkou]]. After the fall of Lushunkou, soldiers under his command were accused of the [[Port Arthur massacre (China)|Port Arthur massacre]] by [[yellow journalism| yellow journalist]] [[James Creelman]] in a widely circulated account with blemished Japan's previous good reputation for its conduct in the war.<ref>{{cite book | last = Paine | first = S.

A movement to purchase the monument by the citizens of K\u014dchi failed to raise the needed funds, and the monument is now used as an ornamental stone bridge in the [[Japanese garden]] of the head office of the Seikad\u014d company in Tokyo.

{"title_page": "Copper in health", "text_new": "[[Image:Copper metabolism.png|thumb|Normal absorption and distribution of copper. Cu = copper, CP = [[ceruloplasmin]], green = ATP7B carrying copper.]]\n[[Copper]] is an essential [[trace element]] that is vital to the health of all living things (humans, plants, animals, and [[microorganisms]]). In humans, copper is essential to the proper functioning of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes. The human body has complex [[homeostatic]] mechanisms which attempt to ensure a constant supply of available copper, while eliminating excess copper whenever this occurs. However, like all essential elements and nutrients, too much or too little [[nutrition]]al ingestion of copper can result in a corresponding condition of copper excess or deficiency in the body, each of which has its own unique set of adverse health effects.\n\nDaily dietary standards for copper have been set by various health agencies around the world. Standards adopted by some nations recommend different copper intake levels for adults, pregnant women, infants, and children, corresponding to the varying need for copper during different stages of life.\n\nIn India, Copper is used for making utensils since ages as they believe copper is helpful in killing bacterias and makes food more clean. In Ayurveda, copper is known as Tamra, it is recommended to drink water empty stomach in the morning which has been stored in copper vessel overnight that helps balance all three doshas(Kapha, Vata and Pitta).\n\n[[Copper deficiency]] and [[Copper toxicity|toxicity]] can be either of [[Genetics|genetic]] or non-genetic origin. The study of copper's [[genetic diseases]], which are the focus of intense international research activity, has shed insight into how human bodies use copper, and why it is important as an essential [[micronutrient]]. The studies have also resulted in successful treatments for genetic copper excess conditions, enabling patients whose lives were once jeopardized to live long and productive lives.\n\nResearchers specializing in the fields of [[microbiology]], [[toxicology]], [[nutrition]], and [[health risk assessments]] are working together to define the precise copper levels that are required for essentiality, while avoiding deficient or excess copper intakes. Results from these studies are expected to be used to fine-tune governmental dietary recommendation programs which are designed to help protect public health.\n\n==Essentiality==\n\nCopper is an essential trace element (i.e., [[micronutrient]]) that is required for plant, animal, and human health.<ref name=scheiber>{{cite book |last1=Scheiber |first1=Ivo |last2=Dringen |first2=Ralf |last3=Mercer |first3=Julian F.

Copper is involved in the formation of [[red blood cells]], the absorption and utilization of iron, the metabolism of [[cholesterol]] and [[glucose]], and the synthesis and release of life-sustaining [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]]. These enzymes in turn produce cellular energy and regulate nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport.\n\nCopper stimulates the [[immune system]] to fight [[infections]], to repair injured tissues, and to promote healing. Copper also helps to neutralize \"[[free-radical]]s\", which can cause severe damage to cells.\n\nCopper's essentiality was first discovered in 1928, when it was demonstrated that rats fed a copper-deficient milk diet were unable to produce sufficient red blood cells.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hart |first1=E.

J. 2001. Copper metabolism and requirements in the pregnant mother, her fetus, and children. New York: International Copper Association{{page needed|date=August 2015}}</ref> The human fetus accumulates copper rapidly in its [[liver]] during the third trimester of pregnancy. At birth, a healthy infant has four times the concentration of copper than a full-grown adult. [[Human milk]] is relatively low in copper, and the [[neonate]]'s liver stores falls rapidly after birth, supplying copper to the fast-growing body during the [[breast feeding]] period. These supplies are necessary to carry out such metabolic functions as [[cellular respiration]], [[melanin]] pigment and connective tissue synthesis, iron metabolism, free radical defense, [[gene expression]], and the normal functioning of the [[heart]] and [[immune system]]s in infants.\n\nInfants have special biochemical mechanisms for adequately managing copper in their bodies while permanent lifelong mechanisms develop and mature.<ref>George Obikoya, http://vitamins-nutrition.org/vitamins/copper.html</ref>\n\nSevere deficiency of copper in pregnant mothers increases the risk of health problems in their fetuses and infants. Health effects noted include low birth weights, muscle weaknesses, and [[neurologic]] problems. However, copper deficiencies in pregnant women can be avoided with a [[balanced diet]].\n\nSince copper availability in the body is hindered by an excess of [[iron]] and [[zinc]] intake, pregnant women prescribed iron supplements to treat [[anemia]] or zinc supplements to treat colds should consult physicians to be sure that the prenatal supplements they may be taking also have nutritionally-significant amounts of copper.\n\nWhen newborn babies are breastfed, the babies' livers and the mothers' breast milk provide sufficient quantities of copper for the first 4\u20136 months of life.<ref>http://copperinfo.com/health/pregnancy.html.</ref> When babies are weaned, a balanced diet should provide adequate sources of copper.\n\nCow's milk and some older [[infant formula]]s are depleted in copper. Most formulas are now fortified with copper to prevent depletion.\n\nMost well-nourished children have adequate intakes of copper. Health-compromised children, including those who are premature, [[malnourish]]ed, have low birth weights, suffer from infections, and who experience rapid [[catch-up growth]] spurts, are at elevated risk for copper deficiencies. Fortunately, diagnosis of copper deficiency in children is clear and reliable once the condition is suspected. Supplements under a physician's supervision usually facilitate a full recovery.\n\n===Homeostasis===\nCopper is absorbed, transported, distributed, stored, and excreted in the body according to complex [[homeostatic]] processes which ensure a constant and sufficient supply of the micronutrient while simultaneously avoiding excess levels.<ref name=scheiber/> If an insufficient amount of copper is ingested for a short period of time, copper stores in the liver will be depleted. Should this depletion continue, a copper health deficiency condition may develop. If too much copper is ingested, an excess condition can result. Both of these conditions, deficiency and excess, can lead to tissue injury and disease. However, due to homeostatic regulation, the human body is capable of balancing a wide range of copper intakes for the needs of healthy individuals.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Katherine E. |last1=Vest |first2=Hayaa F. |last2=Hashemi |first3=Paul A. |last3=Cobine |editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12 \n|chapter=The Copper Metallome in Eukaryotic Cells |title=Metallomics and the Cell |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4 |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_13|pages=451\u2013478|pmid=23595680 }}</ref>\n\nMany aspects of copper [[homeostasis]] are known at the molecular level.<ref name=pmid17454552>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |last2=Solioz |first2=Marc |last3=Krewski |first3=Daniel |last4=Aggett |first4=Peter |last5=Aw |first5=Tar-Ching |last6=Baker |first6=Scott |last7=Crump |first7=Kenny |last8=Dourson |first8=Michael |last9=Haber |first9=Lynne |last10=Hertzberg |first10=Rick |last11=Keen |first11=Carl |last12=Meek |first12=Bette |last13=Rudenko |first13=Larisa |last14=Schoeny |first14=Rita |last15=Slob |first15=Wout |last16=Starr |first16=Tom |title=Copper and Human Health: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Strategies for Modeling Dose-response Relationships |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=157\u2013222 |year=2007 |pmid=17454552 |doi=10.1080/10937400600755911 }}</ref><ref name=pmid20077283>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |title=Essentiality and Toxicity in Copper Health Risk Assessment: Overview, Update and Regulatory Considerations |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=114\u201327 |year=2010 |pmid=20077283 |doi=10.1080/15287390903337100 }}</ref> Copper's essentiality is due to its ability to act as an electron donor or acceptor as its oxidation state fluxes between Cu<sup>1+</sup>([[cuprous]]) and Cu<sup>2+</sup> ([[cupric]]).<ref name=\"Ralph\" /> As a component of about a dozen cuproenzymes, copper is involved in key [[redox]] (i.e., oxidation-reduction) reactions in essential metabolic processes such as [[mitochondria]]l respiration, synthesis of [[melanin]], and cross-linking of [[collagen]].<ref name=\"InternationalProgramme\">International Programme on Chemical Safety. 1998.

Different forms of copper supplementation have different absorption rates. For example, the absorption of copper from [[cupric oxide]] supplements is lower than that from [[copper gluconate]], [[copper sulfate|sulfate]], or [[Basic copper carbonate|carbonate]].\n\nSupplementation is generally not recommended for healthy adults who consume a well-balanced diet which includes a wide range of foods. However, supplementation under the care of a physician may be necessary for premature infants or those with low birth weights, infants fed unfortified formula or cow's milk during the first year of life, and malnourished young children. Physicians may consider copper supplementation for 1) illnesses that reduce digestion (e.g., children with frequent [[diarrhea]] or [[infection]]s; [[alcoholic]]s), 2) insufficient food consumption (e.g., the [[elderly]], the [[infirm]], those with [[eating disorder]]s or on diets), 3) patients taking medications that block the body's use of copper, 4) [[anemia]] patients who are treated with iron supplements, 5) anyone taking zinc supplements, and 6) those suffering from [[osteoporosis]].\n\nMany popular vitamin supplements include copper as small inorganic molecules such as cupric oxide. These supplements can result in excess free copper in the brain as the copper can cross the blood-brain barrier directly. Normally, organic copper in food is first processed by the liver which keeps free copper levels under control.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Copper deficiency and excess health conditions (non-genetic)==\n{{main|Copper deficiency}}\n\nIf insufficient quantities of copper are ingested, copper reserves in the liver will become depleted and a copper deficiency leading to disease or tissue injury (and in extreme cases, death). Toxicity from copper deficiency can be treated with a balanced diet or supplementation under the supervision of a doctor. On the contrary, like all substances, excess copper intake at levels far above [[World Health Organization]] limits can become toxic.<ref name=\"copperinfo_a\">http://copperinfo.com/health/facts.html</ref> Acute copper toxicity is generally associated with accidental ingestion.

Much attention has focused on the potential consequences of copper toxicity in normal and potentially susceptible populations. Potentially susceptible subpopulations include [[hemodialysis]] patients and individuals with chronic liver disease. Recently, concern was expressed about the potential sensitivity to liver disease of individuals who are [[heterozygote]] carriers of Wilson disease genetic defects (i.e., those having one normal and one mutated Wilson copper ATPase gene) but who do not have the disease (which requires defects in both relevant genes).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brewer |first1=George J. |title=Editorial: Is heterozygosity for a Wilson's disease gene defect an important underlying cause of infantile and childhood copper toxicosis syndromes? |journal=The Journal of Trace Elements in Experimental Medicine |volume=13 |issue=3 |year=2000 |pages=249\u201354 |doi=10.1002/1520-670X(2000)13:3<249::AID-JTRA1>3.0.CO;2-L |hdl=2027.42/35050 }}</ref> However, to date, no data are available that either support or refute this hypothesis.\n\n===Acute exposures===\nIn case reports of humans intentionally or accidentally ingesting high concentrations of copper salts (doses usually not known but reported to be 20\u201370&nbsp;grams of copper), a progression of symptoms was observed including abdominal pain, headache, nausea, dizziness, vomiting and diarrhea, [[tachycardia]], respiratory difficulty, [[hemolytic anemia]], [[hematuria]], massive gastrointestinal bleeding, liver and kidney failure, and death.\n\nEpisodes of acute gastrointestinal upset following single or repeated ingestion of drinking water containing elevated levels of copper (generally above 3\u20136&nbsp;mg/L) are characterized by nausea, vomiting, and stomach irritation. These symptoms resolve when copper in the drinking water source is reduced.\n\nThree experimental studies were conducted that demonstrate a threshold for acute gastrointestinal upset of approximately

The most reliable indicator of excess copper status is liver copper concentration. However, measurement of this endpoint in humans is intrusive and not generally conducted except in cases of suspected copper poisoning. Increased serum copper or ceruolplasmin levels are not reliably associated with copper toxicity as elevations in concentrations can be induced by inflammation, infection, disease, malignancies, pregnancy, and other biological stressors. Levels of copper-containing enzymes, such as cytochrome c oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and diaminase oxidase, vary not only in response to copper state but also in response to a variety of other physiological and biochemical factors and therefore are inconsistent markers of excess copper status.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Milne |first1=David B |title=Copper intake and assessment of copper status |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=67 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=1041S\u20131045S |year=1998 |pmid=9587149 |doi=10.1093/ajcn/67.5.1041S }}</ref>\n\nA new candidate biomarker for copper excess as well as deficiency has emerged in recent years.

In humans, copper is essential to the proper functioning of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes. The human body has complex [[homeostatic]] mechanisms which attempt to ensure a constant supply of available copper, while eliminating excess copper whenever this occurs. However, like all essential elements and nutrients, too much or too little [[nutrition]]al ingestion of copper can result in a corresponding condition of copper excess or deficiency in the body, each of which has its own unique set of adverse health effects.\n\nDaily dietary standards for copper have been set by various health agencies around the world. Standards adopted by some nations recommend different copper intake levels for adults, pregnant women, infants, and children, corresponding to the varying need for copper during different stages of life.\n\nIn India, Copper is used for making utensils since ages as they believe copper is helpful in killing bacterias and makes food more clean. In Ayurveda, copper is known as Tamra, it is recommended to drink water empty stomach in the morning which has been stored in copper vessel overnight that helps balance all three doshas(Kapha, Vata and Pitta).\n\n[[Copper deficiency]] and [[Copper toxicity|toxicity]] can be either of [[Genetics|genetic]] or non-genetic origin. The study of copper's [[genetic diseases]], which are the focus of intense international research activity, has shed insight into how human bodies use copper, and why it is important as an essential [[micronutrient]]. The studies have also resulted in successful treatments for genetic copper excess conditions, enabling patients whose lives were once jeopardized to live long and productive lives.\n\nResearchers specializing in the fields of [[microbiology]], [[toxicology]], [[nutrition]], and [[health risk assessments]] are working together to define the precise copper levels that are required for essentiality, while avoiding deficient or excess copper intakes. Results from these studies are expected to be used to fine-tune governmental dietary recommendation programs which are designed to help protect public health.\n\n==Essentiality==\n\nCopper is an essential trace element (i.e., [[micronutrient]]) that is required for plant, animal, and human health.<ref name=scheiber>{{cite book |last1=Scheiber |first1=Ivo |last2=Dringen |first2=Ralf |last3=Mercer |first3=Julian F.

Copper is involved in the formation of [[red blood cells]], the absorption and utilization of iron, the metabolism of [[cholesterol]] and [[glucose]], and the synthesis and release of life-sustaining [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]]. These enzymes in turn produce cellular energy and regulate nerve transmission, blood clotting, and oxygen transport.\n\nCopper stimulates the [[immune system]] to fight [[infections]], to repair injured tissues, and to promote healing.

At birth, a healthy infant has four times the concentration of copper than a full-grown adult. [[Human milk]] is relatively low in copper, and the [[neonate]]'s liver stores falls rapidly after birth, supplying copper to the fast-growing body during the [[breast feeding]] period. These supplies are necessary to carry out such metabolic functions as [[cellular respiration]], [[melanin]] pigment and connective tissue synthesis, iron metabolism, free radical defense, [[gene expression]], and the normal functioning of the [[heart]] and [[immune system]]s in infants.\n\nInfants have special biochemical mechanisms for adequately managing copper in their bodies while permanent lifelong mechanisms develop and mature.<ref>George Obikoya, http://vitamins-nutrition.org/vitamins/copper.html</ref>\n\nSevere deficiency of copper in pregnant mothers increases the risk of health problems in their fetuses and infants. Health effects noted include low birth weights, muscle weaknesses, and [[neurologic]] problems. However, copper deficiencies in pregnant women can be avoided with a [[balanced diet]].\n\nSince copper availability in the body is hindered by an excess of [[iron]] and [[zinc]] intake, pregnant women prescribed iron supplements to treat [[anemia]] or zinc supplements to treat colds should consult physicians to be sure that the prenatal supplements they may be taking also have nutritionally-significant amounts of copper.\n\nWhen newborn babies are breastfed, the babies' livers and the mothers' breast milk provide sufficient quantities of copper for the first 4\u20136 months of life.<ref>http://copperinfo.com/health/pregnancy.html.</ref> When babies are weaned, a balanced diet should provide adequate sources of copper.\n\nCow's milk and some older [[infant formula]]s are depleted in copper. Most formulas are now fortified with copper to prevent depletion.\n\nMost well-nourished children have adequate intakes of copper. Health-compromised children, including those who are premature, [[malnourish]]ed, have low birth weights, suffer from infections, and who experience rapid [[catch-up growth]] spurts, are at elevated risk for copper deficiencies. Fortunately, diagnosis of copper deficiency in children is clear and reliable once the condition is suspected. Supplements under a physician's supervision usually facilitate a full recovery.\n\n===Homeostasis===\nCopper is absorbed, transported, distributed, stored, and excreted in the body according to complex [[homeostatic]] processes which ensure a constant and sufficient supply of the micronutrient while simultaneously avoiding excess levels.<ref name=scheiber/> If an insufficient amount of copper is ingested for a short period of time, copper stores in the liver will be depleted. Should this depletion continue, a copper health deficiency condition may develop. If too much copper is ingested, an excess condition can result. Both of these conditions, deficiency and excess, can lead to tissue injury and disease. However, due to homeostatic regulation, the human body is capable of balancing a wide range of copper intakes for the needs of healthy individuals.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Katherine E. |last1=Vest |first2=Hayaa F. |last2=Hashemi |first3=Paul A. |last3=Cobine |editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12 \n|chapter=The Copper Metallome in Eukaryotic Cells |title=Metallomics and the Cell |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4 |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_13|pages=451\u2013478|pmid=23595680 }}</ref>\n\nMany aspects of copper [[homeostasis]] are known at the molecular level.<ref name=pmid17454552>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |last2=Solioz |first2=Marc |last3=Krewski |first3=Daniel |last4=Aggett |first4=Peter |last5=Aw |first5=Tar-Ching |last6=Baker |first6=Scott |last7=Crump |first7=Kenny |last8=Dourson |first8=Michael |last9=Haber |first9=Lynne |last10=Hertzberg |first10=Rick |last11=Keen |first11=Carl |last12=Meek |first12=Bette |last13=Rudenko |first13=Larisa |last14=Schoeny |first14=Rita |last15=Slob |first15=Wout |last16=Starr |first16=Tom |title=Copper and Human Health: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Strategies for Modeling Dose-response Relationships |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part B |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=157\u2013222 |year=2007 |pmid=17454552 |doi=10.1080/10937400600755911 }}</ref><ref name=pmid20077283>{{cite journal |last1=Stern |first1=Bonnie Ransom |title=Essentiality and Toxicity in Copper Health Risk Assessment: Overview, Update and Regulatory Considerations |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=114\u201327 |year=2010 |pmid=20077283 |doi=10.1080/15287390903337100 }}</ref> Copper's essentiality is due to its ability to act as an electron donor or acceptor as its oxidation state fluxes between Cu<sup>1+</sup>([[cuprous]]) and Cu<sup>2+</sup> ([[cupric]]).<ref name=\"Ralph\" /> As a component of about a dozen cuproenzymes, copper is involved in key [[redox]] (i.e., oxidation-reduction) reactions in essential metabolic processes such as [[mitochondria]]l respiration, synthesis of [[melanin]], and cross-linking of [[collagen]].<ref name=\"InternationalProgramme\">International Programme on Chemical Safety. 1998.

Different forms of copper supplementation have different absorption rates. For example, the absorption of copper from [[cupric oxide]] supplements is lower than that from [[copper gluconate]], [[copper sulfate|sulfate]], or [[Basic copper carbonate|carbonate]].\n\nSupplementation is generally not recommended for healthy adults who consume a well-balanced diet which includes a wide range of foods. However, supplementation under the care of a physician may be necessary for premature infants or those with low birth weights, infants fed unfortified formula or cow's milk during the first year of life, and malnourished young children. Physicians may consider copper supplementation for 1) illnesses that reduce digestion (e.g., children with frequent [[diarrhea]] or [[infection]]s; [[alcoholic]]s), 2) insufficient food consumption (e.g., the [[elderly]], the [[infirm]], those with [[eating disorder]]s or on diets), 3) patients taking medications that block the body's use of copper, 4) [[anemia]] patients who are treated with iron supplements, 5) anyone taking zinc supplements, and 6) those suffering from [[osteoporosis]].\n\nMany popular vitamin supplements include copper as small inorganic molecules such as cupric oxide. These supplements can result in excess free copper in the brain as the copper can cross the blood-brain barrier directly. Normally, organic copper in food is first processed by the liver which keeps free copper levels under control.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Copper deficiency and excess health conditions (non-genetic)==\n{{main|Copper deficiency}}\n\nIf insufficient quantities of copper are ingested, copper reserves in the liver will become depleted and a copper deficiency leading to disease or tissue injury (and in extreme cases, death). Toxicity from copper deficiency can be treated with a balanced diet or supplementation under the supervision of a doctor. On the contrary, like all substances, excess copper intake at levels far above [[World Health Organization]] limits can become toxic.<ref name=\"copperinfo_a\">http://copperinfo.com/health/facts.html</ref> Acute copper toxicity is generally associated with accidental ingestion. These symptoms abate when the high copper food source is no longer ingested.\n\nIn 1996, the International Program on Chemical Safety, a World Health Organization-associated agency, stated \"there is greater risk of health effects from deficiency of copper intake than from excess copper intake.\" This conclusion was confirmed in recent multi-route exposure surveys.<ref name=\"Steven S 2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Georgopoulos |first1=Panos G |last2=Wang |first2=Sheng Wei |last3=Georgopoulos |first3=Ioannis G |last4=Yonone-Lioy |first4=Mary Jean |last5=Lioy |first5=Paul J |title=Assessment of human exposure to copper: A case study using the NHEXAS database |journal=Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=397\u2013409 |year=2006 |pmid=16249795 |doi=10.1038/sj.jea.7500462 }}</ref>\n\nThe health conditions of non-genetic copper deficiency and copper excess are described below.\n\n===Copper deficiency===\nThere are conflicting reports on the extent of deficiency in the U.S. One review indicates approximately 25% of adolescents, adults, and people over 65, do not meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance for copper.<ref name=pmid17454552/> Another source states less common: a federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption from foods and beverages was 1.11 and 1.54&nbsp;mg/day, respectively.

He is a third-generation American of German ancestry on his father\u2019s side, and German, Scottish, and Irish on his mother\u2019s. During the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s between his academic studies and work as a commercial fisherman in the North Pacific, he underwent a journey of reflection that culminated in his becoming Muslim. Nearly three decades later, he has become one of the most authoritative voices of traditional, moderate Islam in the English-speaking world.\n\nKeller studied philosophy, focusing on the epistemology of ethical theory, with Andrew J. Bjelland at Gonzaga University and with the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur, author of ''The Symbolism of Evil'' and ''The Conflict of Interpretations'', at the University of Chicago. He became interested in the Qur\u2019an and began studying Classical Arabic at Chicago in 1975. He traveled to Cairo, Egypt in 1976, where he became Muslim at the famed al-Azhar University in 1977. He completed a graduate degree in philosophy from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1979.\n\nLater that year he returned to the Middle East to pursue private studies with Islamic scholars in Syria and Jordan. In Damascus, he read Shafi\u2019i jurisprudence (fiqh) and tenets of faith (\u2018aqida) with Sheikh \u2018Abd al-Wakil al-Durubi, and Sufism and tenets of faith with Sheikh \u2018Abd al-Rahman al-Shaghouri. In Amman, he read Shafi\u2019i fiqh and Qur\u2019an recital (tajwid) with Sheikh Yunus Hamdan, Hanafi fiqh with Sheikh Ahmad al-Khudari, Shafi\u2019i fiqh and tenets of faith with Sheikh Nuh \u2018Ali Salman al-Qudah, prophetic aphorisms and practices (hadith) and Hanafi fiqh with Sheikh Shu\u2019ayb al-Arna\u2019ut, and Hanafi fiqh and tenets of faith with Sheikh Ahmad al-Jammal.\n\nIn 1982 he took the Shadhili ''tariqa'' from Shaghouri in Damascus. Though often separated from him for extended periods of time due to political exigencies, Keller assiduously applied the teachings of the Shadhili ''tariqa'' and Islamic Sacred Law. Nearly 15 years after first taking Keller as his student, Shaghouri in 1996 invested him as a full sheikh of the ''tariqa'' to guide disciples to ''ihsan'', or \u201cworshipping Allah as though you see Him,\u201d as defined by Islamic tradition.\n\nKeller has a wide following of students. Most reside in English-speaking countries\u2014the United States, Canada, England, and Australia\u2014as well as Turkey, Pakistan, and the Middle East. To better serve his students, he holds ''suhbas''\u2014informal gatherings where a Sufi sheikh teaches about the path\u2014in various cities throughout the world. He has also given public lectures at universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, Stanford, Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of California at Los Angeles.\n\nIn addition to teaching Sufism, Keller has written several books and articles on a wide range of subjects. Perhaps his most important work to date is the voluminous ''Reliance of the Traveler'', an annotated English translation of ''\u2018Umdat al-Salik'', a Shafi\u2019i legal work by Ahmad ibn Naqib al-Misri (d.769/1368). It contains over six thousand legal rulings, and was the first English translation of an Islamic legal work to be certified by al-Azhar University. The translation was begun in 1982 and reviewed over a course of five years with Sheikh \u2018Abd al-Wakil al-Durubi and Sheikh Nuh Ali Salman al-Qudah, both of whom gave written certifications to him for it. Since its first publication in 1990, over thirty thousand copies have been printed. It has not only gained a wide readership among Western Muslims, but has also become the standard reference for non-Muslim academics in America and Britain who teach Islamic jurisprudence at university level.\n\nOther works include ''Port in a Storm'', a comprehensive treatment of the Muslim direction of prayer, as well as a short account of the author\u2019s conversion entitled ''Becoming Muslim.'' Keller has also produced a number of ''tariqa''-related literature and recordings, including a translation of selected Shadhili litanies and a booklet explaining the practices and structure of the ''tariqa'' entitled ''The High Path''.\n\nWith the appearance of ''Reliance of the Traveler,'' Muslims in the West looked to Keller as a spokesman for traditional Islam. He gave a number of seminars and speaking tours to promote the book\u2019s basic manifesto\u2014the superiority of traditional Islam over the reformist versions espoused by the Salafi/Wahhabi and modernist camps. He is joined in this effort by other writers and speakers such as Dr. Umar Farooq Abdullah, Imam Zaid Shakir, Sheikh Hamza Yusuf, and Sheikh Abdul Hakim Murad. These four scholars\u2014all converts\u2014have sparked something of a mini-Renaissance among American and Western Muslims, inspiring them to seek traditional Islamic knowledge of the four Sunni legal schools (madhhabs). The rejection of parochial modernism and Wahhabi ideology is perhaps one of the more significant influences that Keller and similar scholars have had on the practice of Islam in the West.\n\nSheikh Nuh continues to divide his time between translating, writing, and teaching disciples about the Sufi path.

The series was written and recorded at [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018143401/http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archive-date=October 18, 2014|work=[[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]]|title=Janice Burgess, ''The Backyardigans''|date=2016}}</ref> with animation provided by [[Nelvana]]. It centers on a group of five anthropomorphic best friends who use their imaginations to embark on fantastic adventures in their shared backyard. Each episode is set to a different musical genre like reggae, country, or rock, and features at least four songs, performed by the characters with original choreography.\n\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot produced in 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html|title=Rick Lyon: Nickelodeon \"Me and My Friends\" Meercats|work=lyonpuppets.com}}</ref> titled ''Me and My Friends''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/CREDITS3.html|title=Yvette Helin Studio - Credits|work=yvettehelinstudio.com}}</ref> The pilot featured life-sized puppets who danced to songs on an indoor stage. In 2001, Nickelodeon's studio in New York retooled the concept into an animated pilot, using [[motion capture]] techniques to animate the dances. The newer pilot was greenlit, and the series entered production as a co-production between Nickelodeon and Nelvana. Nickelodeon called the show \"a home-grown Nick Jr. property,\" as \"the whole creative team... [had] been part of the Nick Jr. family for years.\"<ref name=\"oct11\"/> \n\nA total of 80 episodes were produced across four seasons, each containing 20 episodes. The series first previewed on [[Treehouse TV]] in Canada on September 11, 2004,<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|title=Treehouse TV programme schedule: September 6\u201312, 2004|work=[[Treehouse TV]]|publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]]|accessdate=July 23, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040908024533/http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|archivedate=September 8, 2004|quote=Saturday, September 11, 2004 at 2:30 PM: ''Backyardigans''}}</ref> followed by its official debut on Nickelodeon's [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] block on October 11, 2004.<ref name=\"oct11\"/> The fourth season wrapped production in 2010 and finished airing on Nick Jr. on July 12, 2013.<ref name=\"jul12\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nEach episode follows a similar pattern and centers around a group of five friends: Pablo, Tyrone, Uniqua, Tasha, and Austin. The characters introduce themselves in their backyard before imagining a new location to enter. The group is often presented with multiple dilemmas along the way to accomplishing a certain goal or priority, or may be challenged with a major single obstacle to defeat or problem to solve. After season one, there is usually a villain in the episode, mainly played by one of the Backyardigans (thus another Backyardigan plays the role of the hero), but the villain of the episode always reforms in the end. The program also follows a musical format, featuring multiple musical numbers performed in the style of a different genre and sung throughout the course of an episode regarding whatever imaginary predicament in which the characters have situated themselves or perhaps a challenge that they have met, every episode opening and concluding with a particular song. The adventures get more advanced after the first season. When the Backyardigans have achieved their mission or defeated any disadvantages, the fantasy sequence fades, restoring actuality to the setting of the episodes as the closing song is sung, the characters scurrying to their houses for a snack. The main character or characters then opens the snack host's house door, fence, or around the corner, and shouts the main catchphrase for the last time and then closes the door. The picture then is lifeless with some background bird noises often heard as iris closes, ending the episode before the credits roll.\n\n==Characters==\nEach of the five characters on the show have two voice actors: one for speaking, and the other for singing.\n\nThe dancing on the show is first performed by live-action dancers, and their movements are later transported to animation. Choreographer, Beth Bogush, describes the process: \"What we do is we film the live footage in the studio, send that off and they do a [[Traditional animation#Layout|Leica]], and then they send it to the animators. The animators watch, and were pretty precise. What we film for that day is pretty close to what you see in the character.\"<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1542683,00.html|title=Who gets those 'toon-toed ''Backyardigans'' to dance? |last=Clarke|first=Eileen |date=October 4, 2006 |work=Bring It On |publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> In season one, the Backyardigans usually wear their normal clothes while on an adventure, usually accompanied with accessories.

Creator [[Janice Burgess]] describes Uniqua as the child she wishes she was like as a child.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Burgess |first=Janice |url=http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml |title=Meet the Creator of The Backyardigans! |publisher=NickJr.com |accessdate=2008-12-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820062324/http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml|archivedate=August 20, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> She is the only main character to appear in every episode. Speaking voice: [[Lashawn Tin\u00e1h Jefferies]]. Singing voice: [[Jamia Simone Nash]] (seasons 1\u20133) and Avion Baker (season 4). Dancer: Hattie Mae Williams.\n* Pablo is a yellow-beaked, blue [[penguin]] who wears a blue bow tie and a blue-and-yellow propeller [[Beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]]. He is very respectable and often acts on his own accord. Pablo tends to be the most excitable of the group and is best friends with Tyrone and Uniqua. Due to his energy and impetuousness, he often goes into a \"panic attack\" when he faces an obstacle, running around in circles and telling everyone not to worry until someone interrupts him. The number of panic attacks decreased considerably after season 1, though in the episode ''[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#The Flipper!|The Flipper!]],'' his propensity for getting overexcited is a major plot point. He also usually plays the villain in his friends' games. Pablo does not appear one time: \"[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#Chichen-Itza Pizza|Chichen-Itza Pizza]]\". Speaking voice: [[Zach Tyler Eisen]] (season 1) and Jake Goldberg (seasons 2\u20134). Singing voice: Sean Curley. Dancer: Tasha Cooper (seasons 1\u20133), Jonathan Sandler (season 3), Steven Konopelski (seasons 3\u20134), Jacob Wimar (season 4), and Paul Flanagan (season 4).\n* Tyrone is a good-natured, yet somewhat fearful, red-haired orange [[moose]] who wears a red-and-blue striped shirt, and is best friends with Pablo and Uniqua. He is almost the complete opposite of Pablo in terms of personality, with his laid-back and cool-headed character. Tyrone is known for his sarcastic comments, one of them being \"That certainly was convenient.\" At the end of most episodes, when he appears, he says \"That was an excellent ''(type)'' adventure, don't you think?\" (though Pablo, Austin, and Tasha recite the line when he does not appear). Despite not appearing to wear trousers (except on rare occasions), Tyrone somehow manages to put his hands in his pockets. Speaking voice: Reginald Davis Jr. (season 1), [[Jordan Coleman]] (seasons 2\u20133), and Christopher Grant, Jr. (season 4). Singing voice: [[Corwin C. Tuggles]] (season 1), [[Leon Thomas III]] (seasons 2\u20133), Damani Roberts (season 3) and [[Tyrel Jackson Williams]] (season 3-4). Dancer: Greg Sinacori (seasons 1\u20132, 4), Bradley Shelver (season 3), and Andrew Cao (season 3).\n* Tasha is a strong-willed, yellow [[hippo]]. Tasha wears an orange, flowered dress and red Mary-Jane shoes. She is a sweet girl on the outside, but is rational and likes to get her own way. She is the most serious of the major characters, although Tasha can be just as easygoing as the others from time to time. She is more feminine than her good friend Uniqua. In seasons 2-4, she has a more amiable personality. She tends to be grumpy if she is not the boss. Her catchphrase is \"Oh, for goodness sakes!\" Speaking voice: [[Naelee Rae]] (seasons 1\u20132) and Gianna Bruzzese (seasons 3\u20134). Singing voice: Kristin Danielle Klabunde (seasons 1\u20133) and Gabriella Malek (seasons 3\u20134). Dancer: Darlene Dirstine (seasons 1\u20133), Amanda Ulibarri (season 4), and Nancy Renee Braun (season 4).\n* Austin is a shy but fun-loving purple [[kangaroo]]. Though generally soft-spoken in Season 1, due to recently moving into the neighborhood, Austin starts to come out of his shell as the series progresses. He is revealed to be smart and imaginative. Austin rarely appears in the spotlight, but takes the role of the lead character in several episodes. His catchphrase varies from show to show. In more than one episode, he refers to himself as \"Just Austin.\" Says Bogush: \"Austin's usually the one pulling up the rear. He's kind of a get-along guy.\"<ref name=\"ref1\"/> Austin has been shown to occasionally display a more villainous side, such as in the episodes \"High Tea\" and \"The Magic Skateboard\". Speaking voice: [[Jonah Bobo]]. Singing voice: Thomas Sharkey (seasons 1\u20133) and Nicholas Barasch (season 4). Dancer: Kristen Frost.\n\n===Recurring===\n*Sherman \u2013 A small, orange-spotted yellow worm. Sherman is easily scared due to his small size. He appears in \"The Heart of the Jungle\", \"Polka Palace Party\", and \"Attack of the 50 Foot Worman\". His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Wormans \u2013 A fictional species of colorful, worm-like creatures who speak in squeaks and gibberish. They appear in all the seasons of the show.\n*Dragon \u2013 A friendly, green-colored dragon who appears three times (the movie \"Tale of the Mighty Knights\" and the episode \"The Tale of the Not-So-Nice Dragon\"). He hatched from a spotted egg and lives inside of Dragon Mountain. His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Aliens \u2013 Green-colored aliens with eyestalks appear four times: \"Mission to Mars\", \"News Flash\", \"Los Galacticos\", and \"The Big Dipper Diner\".\n*Giant clam \u2013 A hungry, irritable clam who appears in \"The Legend of the Volcano Sisters\" and \"The Great Dolphin Race\". It is very protective of its pearl. It pants and acts like a dog.\n*Voices \u2013 Voices were included in the episodes \"Secret Mission\" and \"It's Great To Be A Ghost!\" that do not come from any shown character.\n*Robot Roscoe \u2013 A robot owned by Austin who appears three times in the fourth season (the movie \"Robot Rampage\" and the episode \"Elephant on the Run\"). His voice is provided by Evan Mathew Weinstein.\n\n==Setting==\nThe characters live in houses adjoining a large backyard common to the three central houses (Uniqua's, Pablo's and Tyrone's) that is transformed by imagination into various adventure settings. Each house roughly corresponds to the color scheme of the character: Uniqua in a pink house, Pablo lives in a blue one, and Tyrone in an orange one. Tasha's house, which is to the left of the three central houses, is yellow and Austin's, to the right, is partially obscured by a fence but what is visible is purple. The fence, which surrounds the combined properties of the three main characters (Uniqua, Pablo and Tyrone), has a gate in it which leads to Austin's house. The curve of the cul-de-sac allows the play area to be roughly equal in distance from each house's back door.\n\nNot everything that appears in the imaginary world has a real-world counterpart. Often [[tree]]s, [[boulder]]s, brickwork, or similar objects appear where nothing originally existed. By the same token, even large trees in the real garden disappear completely when the imagination part of the story commences.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n{{:List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n\n==Production==\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot titled \"Me and My Friends,\" produced at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in September 1998.<ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/GalleryMotionPictures/MOTIONPICTURESGALLERY.htm| title=Me and My Friends Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios| publisher=Yvette Helin Studio| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot, Rick Lyon with Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html| title=Me and My Friends Pilot, Rick Lyon Puppeteer| publisher=Rick Lyon| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was rejected by Nickelodeon, and the concept was reworked into an animated short in 2002.<ref name=\"Backyardigans, 2002\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=7814102| title=Backyardigans, 2002| publisher=TMFile| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was greenlit by Nickelodeon to become a full-length series.

The series was written and recorded at [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018143401/http://nickanimationstudio.com/janice-burgess-the-backyardigans|archive-date=October 18, 2014|work=[[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]]|title=Janice Burgess, ''The Backyardigans''|date=2016}}</ref> with animation provided by [[Nelvana]]. It centers on a group of five anthropomorphic best friends who use their imaginations to embark on fantastic adventures in their shared backyard. Each episode is set to a different musical genre like reggae, country, or rock, and features at least four songs, performed by the characters with original choreography.\n\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot produced in 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html|title=Rick Lyon: Nickelodeon \"Me and My Friends\" Meercats|work=lyonpuppets.com}}</ref> titled ''Me and My Friends''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/CREDITS3.html|title=Yvette Helin Studio - Credits|work=yvettehelinstudio.com}}</ref> The pilot featured life-sized puppets who danced to songs on an indoor stage. In 2001, Nickelodeon's studio in New York retooled the concept into an animated pilot, using [[motion capture]] techniques to animate the dances. The newer pilot was greenlit, and the series entered production as a co-production between Nickelodeon and Nelvana. Nickelodeon called the show \"a home-grown Nick Jr. property,\" as \"the whole creative team... [had] been part of the Nick Jr. family for years.\"<ref name=\"oct11\"/> \n\nA total of 80 episodes were produced across four seasons, each containing 20 episodes. The series first previewed on [[Treehouse TV]] in Canada on September 11, 2004,<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|title=Treehouse TV programme schedule: September 6\u201312, 2004|work=[[Treehouse TV]]|publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]]|accessdate=July 23, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040908024533/http://www.treehousetv.com/parents/schedule/eastern.asp|archivedate=September 8, 2004|quote=Saturday, September 11, 2004 at 2:30 PM: ''Backyardigans''}}</ref> followed by its official debut on Nickelodeon's [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] block on October 11, 2004.<ref name=\"oct11\"/> The fourth season wrapped production in 2010 and finished airing on Nick Jr. on July 12, 2013.<ref name=\"jul12\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nEach episode follows a similar pattern and centers around a group of five friends: Pablo, Tyrone, Uniqua, Tasha, and Austin. The characters introduce themselves in their backyard before imagining a new location to enter. The group is often presented with multiple dilemmas along the way to accomplishing a certain goal or priority, or may be challenged with a major single obstacle to defeat or problem to solve. After season one, there is usually a villain in the episode, mainly played by one of the Backyardigans (thus another Backyardigan plays the role of the hero), but the villain of the episode always reforms in the end. The program also follows a musical format, featuring multiple musical numbers performed in the style of a different genre and sung throughout the course of an episode regarding whatever imaginary predicament in which the characters have situated themselves or perhaps a challenge that they have met, every episode opening and concluding with a particular song. The adventures get more advanced after the first season. When the Backyardigans have achieved their mission or defeated any disadvantages, the fantasy sequence fades, restoring actuality to the setting of the episodes as the closing song is sung, the characters scurrying to their houses for a snack. The main character or characters then opens the snack host's house door, fence, or around the corner, and shouts the main catchphrase for the last time and then closes the door. The picture then is lifeless with some background bird noises often heard as iris closes, ending the episode before the credits roll.\n\n==Characters==\nEach of the five characters on the show have two voice actors: one for speaking, and the other for singing.\n\nThe dancing on the show is first performed by live-action dancers, and their movements are later transported to animation. Choreographer, Beth Bogush, describes the process: \"What we do is we film the live footage in the studio, send that off and they do a [[Traditional animation#Layout|Leica]], and then they send it to the animators. The animators watch, and were pretty precise. What we film for that day is pretty close to what you see in the character.\"<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1542683,00.html|title=Who gets those 'toon-toed ''Backyardigans'' to dance? |last=Clarke|first=Eileen |date=October 4, 2006 |work=Bring It On |publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> In season one, the Backyardigans usually wear their normal clothes while on an adventure, usually accompanied with accessories. They rarely wear their normal clothes in an adventure after the first season.\n\n===Main===\n<!-- Any speculation about the character's species will be removed. -->\n* Uniqua is a curious, self-confident, and high-spirited, pink, spotted character. The series uses the name \"Uniqua\" for both the character and her species. She wears pink, polka-dotted [[overalls]] and has a pair of swirled [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] on top of her head. Uniqua is sweet and friendly, though her strong opinions and occasional stubbornness get in the way of her relationships. While imagining herself having the roles that require brains and fortitude (such as a scientist or pirate captain) and despite her love of books (as seen in episodes such as \"The Masked Retriever\"). Creator [[Janice Burgess]] describes Uniqua as the child she wishes she was like as a child.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Burgess |first=Janice |url=http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml |title=Meet the Creator of The Backyardigans! |publisher=NickJr.com |accessdate=2008-12-27|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820062324/http://www.nickjr.com/shows/backyardigans/backyardigans-show-info/meet-backyardigans-creator.jhtml|archivedate=August 20, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> She is the only main character to appear in every episode. Speaking voice: [[Lashawn Tin\u00e1h Jefferies]]. Singing voice: [[Jamia Simone Nash]] (seasons 1\u20133) and Avion Baker (season 4). Dancer: Hattie Mae Williams.\n* Pablo is a yellow-beaked, blue [[penguin]] who wears a blue bow tie and a blue-and-yellow propeller [[Beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]]. He is very respectable and often acts on his own accord. Pablo tends to be the most excitable of the group and is best friends with Tyrone and Uniqua. Due to his energy and impetuousness, he often goes into a \"panic attack\" when he faces an obstacle, running around in circles and telling everyone not to worry until someone interrupts him. The number of panic attacks decreased considerably after season 1, though in the episode ''[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#The Flipper!|The Flipper!]],'' his propensity for getting overexcited is a major plot point. He also usually plays the villain in his friends' games. Pablo does not appear one time: \"[[List of The Backyardigans episodes#Chichen-Itza Pizza|Chichen-Itza Pizza]]\". Speaking voice: [[Zach Tyler Eisen]] (season 1) and Jake Goldberg (seasons 2\u20134). Singing voice: Sean Curley. Dancer: Tasha Cooper (seasons 1\u20133), Jonathan Sandler (season 3), Steven Konopelski (seasons 3\u20134), Jacob Wimar (season 4), and Paul Flanagan (season 4).\n* Tyrone is a good-natured, yet somewhat fearful, red-haired orange [[moose]] who wears a red-and-blue striped shirt, and is best friends with Pablo and Uniqua. He is almost the complete opposite of Pablo in terms of personality, with his laid-back and cool-headed character. Tyrone is known for his sarcastic comments, one of them being \"That certainly was convenient.\" At the end of most episodes, when he appears, he says \"That was an excellent ''(type)'' adventure, don't you think?\" (though Pablo, Austin, and Tasha recite the line when he does not appear). Despite not appearing to wear trousers (except on rare occasions), Tyrone somehow manages to put his hands in his pockets. Speaking voice: Reginald Davis Jr. (season 1), [[Jordan Coleman]] (seasons 2\u20133), and Christopher Grant, Jr. (season 4). Singing voice: [[Corwin C. Tuggles]] (season 1), [[Leon Thomas III]] (seasons 2\u20133), Damani Roberts (season 3) and [[Tyrel Jackson Williams]] (season 3-4). Dancer: Greg Sinacori (seasons 1\u20132, 4), Bradley Shelver (season 3), and Andrew Cao (season 3).\n* Tasha is a strong-willed, yellow [[hippo]]. Tasha wears an orange, flowered dress and red Mary-Jane shoes. She is a sweet girl on the outside, but is rational and likes to get her own way. She is the most serious of the major characters, although Tasha can be just as easygoing as the others from time to time. She is more feminine than her good friend Uniqua. In seasons 2-4, she has a more amiable personality. She tends to be grumpy if she is not the boss. Her catchphrase is \"Oh, for goodness sakes!\" Speaking voice: [[Naelee Rae]] (seasons 1\u20132) and Gianna Bruzzese (seasons 3\u20134). Singing voice: Kristin Danielle Klabunde (seasons 1\u20133) and Gabriella Malek (seasons 3\u20134). Dancer: Darlene Dirstine (seasons 1\u20133), Amanda Ulibarri (season 4), and Nancy Renee Braun (season 4).\n* Austin is a shy but fun-loving purple [[kangaroo]]. Though generally soft-spoken in Season 1, due to recently moving into the neighborhood, Austin starts to come out of his shell as the series progresses. He is revealed to be smart and imaginative. Austin rarely appears in the spotlight, but takes the role of the lead character in several episodes. His catchphrase varies from show to show. In more than one episode, he refers to himself as \"Just Austin.\" Says Bogush: \"Austin's usually the one pulling up the rear. He's kind of a get-along guy.\"<ref name=\"ref1\"/> Austin has been shown to occasionally display a more villainous side, such as in the episodes \"High Tea\" and \"The Magic Skateboard\". Speaking voice: [[Jonah Bobo]]. Singing voice: Thomas Sharkey (seasons 1\u20133) and Nicholas Barasch (season 4). Dancer: Kristen Frost.\n\n===Recurring===\n*Sherman \u2013 A small, orange-spotted yellow worm. Sherman is easily scared due to his small size. He appears in \"The Heart of the Jungle\", \"Polka Palace Party\", and \"Attack of the 50 Foot Worman\". His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Wormans \u2013 A fictional species of colorful, worm-like creatures who speak in squeaks and gibberish. They appear in all the seasons of the show.\n*Dragon \u2013 A friendly, green-colored dragon who appears three times (the movie \"Tale of the Mighty Knights\" and the episode \"The Tale of the Not-So-Nice Dragon\"). He hatched from a spotted egg and lives inside of Dragon Mountain. His voice is provided by Oliver Wyman.\n*Aliens \u2013 Green-colored aliens with eyestalks appear four times: \"Mission to Mars\", \"News Flash\", \"Los Galacticos\", and \"The Big Dipper Diner\".\n*Giant clam \u2013 A hungry, irritable clam who appears in \"The Legend of the Volcano Sisters\" and \"The Great Dolphin Race\". It is very protective of its pearl. It pants and acts like a dog.\n*Voices \u2013 Voices were included in the episodes \"Secret Mission\" and \"It's Great To Be A Ghost!\" that do not come from any shown character.\n*Robot Roscoe \u2013 A robot owned by Austin who appears three times in the fourth season (the movie \"Robot Rampage\" and the episode \"Elephant on the Run\"). His voice is provided by Evan Mathew Weinstein.\n\n==Setting==\nThe characters live in houses adjoining a large backyard common to the three central houses (Uniqua's, Pablo's and Tyrone's) that is transformed by imagination into various adventure settings. Each house roughly corresponds to the color scheme of the character: Uniqua in a pink house, Pablo lives in a blue one, and Tyrone in an orange one. Tasha's house, which is to the left of the three central houses, is yellow and Austin's, to the right, is partially obscured by a fence but what is visible is purple. The fence, which surrounds the combined properties of the three main characters (Uniqua, Pablo and Tyrone), has a gate in it which leads to Austin's house. The curve of the cul-de-sac allows the play area to be roughly equal in distance from each house's back door.\n\nNot everything that appears in the imaginary world has a real-world counterpart. Often [[tree]]s, [[boulder]]s, brickwork, or similar objects appear where nothing originally existed. By the same token, even large trees in the real garden disappear completely when the imagination part of the story commences.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n{{:List of The Backyardigans episodes}}\n\n==Production==\nThe series was based upon a live-action pilot titled \"Me and My Friends,\" produced at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] in September 1998.<ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.yvettehelinstudio.com/GalleryMotionPictures/MOTIONPICTURESGALLERY.htm| title=Me and My Friends Pilot from Nickelodeon Studios| publisher=Yvette Helin Studio| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Me and My Friends Nickelodeon Pilot, Rick Lyon with Nickelodeon Studios\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.lyonpuppets.com/meercats.html| title=Me and My Friends Pilot, Rick Lyon Puppeteer| publisher=Rick Lyon| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was rejected by Nickelodeon, and the concept was reworked into an animated short in 2002.<ref name=\"Backyardigans, 2002\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.tmfile.com/mark/?q=7814102| title=Backyardigans, 2002| publisher=TMFile| accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref> This pilot was greenlit by Nickelodeon to become a full-length series.

It contains songs from seasons 1-2, as well as all the songs from [[List of The Backyardigans episodes#Tale of the Mighty Knights (parts 1 and 2)|Tale of the Mighty Knights]]. There is a total of 22 tracks. There's also a special iTunes version of this album, containing 5 bonus tracks in addition to the 22 tracks, totaling 27 tracks. This album was released in a cardboard foldout case, rather than a jewel case like the previous two releases.

Samuelson]] is usually credited as the first economist to develop the theory of public goods. In his classic 1954 paper ''The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure'',<ref>{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |authorlink=Paul Samuelson |title=The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |year=1954 |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=387\u201389 |doi=10.2307/1925895 |jstor=1925895}}<br />See also {{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |year=1955 |title=Diagrammatic Exposition of a Theory of Public Expenditure |journal=Review of Economics and Statistics |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=350\u201356 |jstor=1925849 |doi=10.2307/1925849}}</ref> he defined a public good, or as he called it in the paper a \"collective consumption good\", as follows:\n\n<blockquote>[goods] which all enjoy in common in the sense that each individual's consumption of such a good leads to no subtractions from any other individual's consumption of that good...</blockquote>\n\nThis is the property that has become known as ''[[Nonrival good|non-rivalry]]''. A ''pure public good'' exhibits a second property called ''[[Non-excludable good|non-excludability]]'': that is, it is impossible to exclude any individuals from consuming the good.\n\nHowever, many goods may satisfy the two public good conditions (''[[Non-rival good|non-rivalry]]'' and ''[[non-excludability]]'') only to a certain extent or only some of the time. These goods are known as ''impure public goods''.\n\nThe opposite of a public good is a ''[[private good]]'', which does not possess these properties. A loaf of bread, for example, is a private good; its owner can exclude others from using it, and once it has been consumed, it cannot be used by others.\n\nA good that is rivalrous but ''non-excludable'' is sometimes called a ''[[common-pool resource]]''. Such goods raise similar issues to public goods: the mirror to the ''public goods problem'' for this case is the '[[tragedy of the commons]]'. For example, it is so difficult to enforce restrictions on [[deep-sea fishing]] that the world's [[fish stock]]s can be seen as a non-excludable resource, but one which is finite and diminishing.\n\n=== Definition matrix ===\n{{Good (economics)}}\n[[Elinor Ostrom]] proposed additional modifications to the classification of goods to identify fundamental differences that affect the incentives facing individuals<ref>{{cite book |last1=Elinor |first1=Ostrom |title=Understanding Institutional Diversity |date=2005 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ}}</ref>\n\n# Replacing the term \"rivalry of consumption\" with \"subtractability of use\".\n# Conceptualizing subtractability of use and excludability to vary from low to high rather than characterizing them as either present or absent.\n# Overtly adding a very important fourth type of good\u2014common-pool resources\u2014that shares the attribute of subtractability with private goods and difficulty of exclusion with public goods. Forests, water systems, fisheries, and the global atmosphere are all common-pool resources of immense importance for the survival of humans on this earth.\n# Changing the name of a \"club\" good to a \"toll\" good since many goods that share these characteristics are provided by small scale public as well as private associations.\n\n=== Challenges in identifying public goods ===\n\nThe definition of non-excludability states that it is impossible to exclude individuals from consumption. Technology now allows radio or TV broadcasts to be encrypted such that persons without a special decoder are excluded from the broadcast. Many forms of [[information good]]s have characteristics of public goods. For example, a poem can be read by many people without reducing the consumption of that good by others; in this sense, it is non-rivalrous. Similarly, the information in most patents can be used by any party without reducing consumption of that good by others. [[Official statistics]] provide a clear example of information goods that are public goods, since they are created to be non-excludable.  Creative works may be excludable in some circumstances, however: the individual who wrote the poem may decline to share it with others by not publishing it. [[Copyright]]s and [[patent]]s both encourage the creation of such non-rival goods by providing temporary monopolies, or, in the terminology of public goods, providing a legal mechanism to enforce excludability for a limited period of time. For public goods, the \"lost revenue\" of the producer of the good is not part of the definition: a public good is a good whose consumption does not reduce any other's consumption of that good.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Demsetz |first=Harold |title=Full Access The Private Production of Public Goods |journal=Journal of Law and Economics |date=October 1970 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=293\u2013306 |jstor=229060 |doi=10.1086/466695}}</ref>\n\nDebate has been generated among economists whether such a category of \"public goods\" exists. [[Steven Shavell]] has suggested the following:\n<blockquote>when professional economists talk about public goods they do ''not'' mean that there are a general category of goods that share the same economic characteristics, manifest the same dysfunctions, and that may thus benefit from pretty similar corrective solutions...there is merely an infinite series of particular problems (some of [[overproduction]], some of underproduction, and so on), each with a particular solution that cannot be deduced from the theory, but that instead would depend on local empirical factors.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boyle |first=James |title=Shamans, Software, and Spleens: Law and the Construction of the Information Society |year=1996 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Mass. |isbn=978-0-674-80522-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/shamanssoftwares00boyl/page/268 268] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/shamanssoftwares00boyl/page/268 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nCommon confusion is that public goods are goods provided by the [[public sector]]. Although it is often the case that government is involved in producing public goods, this is not necessarily the case. Public goods may be ''naturally'' available. They may be produced by private individuals and firms, by non-state [[collective action]], or they may not be produced at all.<ref name=\"Touffut 2006 p. 26\">{{cite book |last=Touffut |first=J.P. |title=Advancing Public Goods |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing, Incorporated |series=The Cournot Centre for Economic Studies |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-84720-184-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HW_KRCi4T_0C&pg=PA26 |access-date=27 August 2018 |page=26}}</ref>\n\nThe theoretical concept of public goods does not distinguish with regard to the geographical region in which a good may be produced or consumed. However, some theorists such as [[Inge Kaul]] use the term \"[[global public good]]\" for public goods which is non-rival and non-excludable throughout the whole world, as opposed to a public good which exists in just one national area. Knowledge has been held to be an example of a global public good,<ref>[[Joseph E. Stiglitz]], \"Knowledge as a Global Public Good\" in ''Global Public Goods'', {{ISBN|978-0-19-513052-2}}</ref> but also as a commons, the [[knowledge commons]].<ref name=\"ostrom\">{{cite book |title=Understanding Knowledge as a Commons: From Theory to Practice |last=Hess |first=Charlotte |author2=Ostrom, Elinor |year=2007 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-262-08357-7 |pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Samuelson condition.png|thumb|Aggregate demand (\u03a3MB) is the sum of individual demands (MBi)]]\nGraphically, non-rivalry means that if each of several individuals has a demand curve for a public good, then the individual demand curves are summed vertically to get the aggregate demand curve for the public good. This is in contrast to the procedure for deriving the aggregate demand for a private good, where individual demands are summed horizontally.\n\nSome writers have used the term \"public good\" to refer only to non-excludable \"pure public goods\" and refer to excludable public goods as \"[[club goods]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=James M. Buchanan |authorlink=James M. Buchanan |title=An Economic Theory of Clubs |journal=[[Economica]] |date=February 1965 |volume=32 |pages=1\u201314 |doi=10.2307/2552442 |issue=125 |jstor=2552442}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Half Dome with Eastern Yosemite Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Yosemite National Park]], an example of an environmental good.]]\nCommon examples of public goods include: [[defence (military)|defence]], public [[fireworks]], [[lighthouse]]s, [[air pollution|clean air]] and other [[environmental good]]s, and [[information good]]s, such as [[official statistics]], [[open-source software]], [[authorship]], public [[PBS|television]] and radio, and [[invention]]. Some goods, like [[orphan drug]]s, require special governmental incentives to be produced, but cannot be classified as public goods since they do not fulfill the above requirements (non-excludable and non-rivalrous.) Law enforcement, streets, libraries, museums, and education are commonly misclassified as public goods, but they are technically classified in economic terms as quasi-public goods because excludability ''is'' possible, but they do still fit some of the characteristics of public goods.<ref>Pucciarelli F., [[Andreas Kaplan]] (2016) Competition and Strategy in Higher Education: Managing Complexity and Uncertainty, Business Horizons, Volume 59</ref><ref name=ppp>{{cite book |author1=Campbell R.

No ship's use detracts from that of others, but since most of the benefit of a lighthouse accrues to ships using particular [[port]]s, lighthouse maintenance can be profitably bundled with port fees ([[Ronald Coase]], ''[[The Lighthouse in Economics]]'' 1974). This has been sufficient to fund actual lighthouses.\n\n[[Technological progress]] can create new public goods. The most simple examples are street lights, which are relatively recent inventions (by historical standards). One person's enjoyment of them does not detract from other persons' enjoyment, and it currently would be prohibitively expensive to charge individuals separately for the amount of light they presumably use. [[Official statistics]] are another example.  The government's ability to collect, process and provide high-quality information to guide decision-making at all levels has been strongly advanced by technological progress.

The production of public goods results in positive [[externality|externalities]] which are not remunerated. If private organizations do not reap all the benefits of a public good which they have produced, their incentives to produce it voluntarily might be insufficient. Consumers can take advantage of public goods without contributing sufficiently to their creation. This is called the [[free rider problem]], or occasionally, the \"easy rider problem\" (because consumers' contributions will be small but non-zero). If too many consumers decide to \"free-ride\", private costs exceed private benefits and the incentive to provide the good or service through the market disappears. The market thus fails to provide a good or service for which there is a need.<ref>{{Cite book |last=[[Ray Powell (disambiguation)|Ray Powell]] |title=AQA AS Economics |edition=paperback |date=June 2008 |publisher=Philip Allan |page=352 |chapter=10: Private goods, public goods and externalities |isbn=978-0-340-94750-0}}</ref>\n\nThe free rider problem depends on a conception of the human being as ''[[homo economicus]]'': purely rational and also purely selfish\u2014extremely individualistic, considering only those benefits and costs that directly affect him or her. Public goods give such a person an incentive to be a free rider.\n\nFor example, consider national defense, a standard example of a pure public good. Suppose ''homo economicus'' thinks about exerting some extra effort to defend the nation. The benefits to the individual of this effort would be very low, since the benefits would be distributed among all of the millions of other people in the country. There is also a very high possibility that he or she could get injured or killed during the course of his or her military service.\n\nOn the other hand, the free rider knows that he or she cannot be excluded from the benefits of national defense, regardless of whether he or she contributes to it. There is also no way that these benefits can be split up and distributed as individual parcels to people. The free rider would not voluntarily exert any extra effort, unless there is some inherent pleasure or material reward for doing so (for example, money paid by the government, as with an all-volunteer army or [[mercenaries]]). The free-riding problem is even more complicated than it was thought to be until recently.  Any time non-excludability results in failure to pay the true marginal value (often called the \"demand revelation problem\"), it will also result in failure to generate proper income levels, since households will not give up valuable leisure if they cannot individually increment a good.<ref>Graves, P. E., [http://works.bepress.com/philip_graves/1 \"A Note on the Valuation of Collective Goods: Overlooked Input Market Free Riding for Non-Individually Incrementable Goods] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630044449/http://works.bepress.com/philip_graves/1/ |date=30 June 2013 }}\", ''The B.E.

In the case of an information good, however, because of its characteristics of non-excludability and also because of almost zero reproduction costs, commoditization is difficult and not always efficient even from a neoclassical economic point of view.<ref>{{cite book |last=Babe |first=Robert |title=Essay in Information, Public Policy and Political Economy |year=1995 |publisher=Westview Press |location=University of Ottawa |chapter=Chapter 3}}</ref>\n\n== Efficient production levels of public goods ==\n{{Essay|section|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe [[Pareto optimum]] provision of a public good in a society is where the combined sum of the [[marginal rate of substitution]] between private goods and a given public good of all individuals is equal to the [[marginal rate of transformation]]. This contrasts to the Pareto optimality condition of private goods, in which each consumers' marginal rate of substitution is equal; as is the societies marginal rate of transformation.<ref>Brown, C. V.; Jackson, P. M. (1986), \"The Economic Analysis of Public Goods\", ''Public Sector Economics'', 3rd Edition, Chapter 3, pp. 48\u201379.</ref>\n\nAn example is a community of just two consumers and the government is considering whether or not to build a [[public park]]. One person is prepared to pay up to $200 for its use, while the other is willing to pay up to $100. The total value to the two individuals of having the park is $300. If it can be produced for $225, there is a $75 gain on its production since it provides services that the community values at $300 at a cost of only $225.\n\nRegardless of the method of providing public goods, the efficient level of such provision is still being subjected to economic analysis. For instance, the [[Samuelson condition]] calculates the efficient level of public goods production to be where the ratio of the [[marginalism|marginal]] [[social cost]] of public and private goods production equals the ratio of the [[marginal social benefit]] of public and private goods production.\n\n== Ownership ==\nAn important question regarding public goods is whether they should be owned by the public or the private sector. Economic theorists such as [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]] (1995) argue that ownership matters for investment incentives when contracts are incomplete.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Firms, Contracts, and Financial Structure |last=Hart |first=Oliver |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |isbn= |location= |pages=}}</ref> The incomplete contracting paradigm has been applied to public goods by [[Tim Besley|Besley]] and [[Maitreesh Ghatak|Ghatak]] (2001).<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Government Versus Private Ownership of Public Goods |url=http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/116/4/1343 |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |year=2001 |issn=0033-5533 |pages=1343\u201372 |volume=116 |issue=4 |doi=10.1162/003355301753265598 |first=Timothy |last=Besley |first2=Maitreesh |last2=Ghatak|citeseerx=10.1.1.584.6739 }}</ref> They consider the government and a non-governmental organization (NGO) who can both make investments to provide a public good. Besley and Ghatak show that the party who has a larger valuation for the public good should be the owner, regardless of whether the government or the NGO has a better investment technology. This result contrasts with the case of private goods studied by Hart (1995), where the party with the better investment technology should be the owner. However, more recently it has been shown that the investment technology matters also in the public-good case when a party is indispensable or when there are bargaining frictions between the government and the NGO.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Nature of human capital, technology and ownership of public goods |journal=Journal of Public Economics |year=2012 |pages=939\u201345 |volume=96 |series=Fiscal Federalism |issue=11\u201312 |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2012.07.005 |first=Maija |last=Halonen-Akatwijuka|citeseerx=10.1.1.173.3797 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Government versus private ownership of public goods: The role of bargaining frictions |journal=Journal of Public Economics |year=2015 |pages=23\u201331 |volume=132 |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2015.09.009 |first=Patrick W. |last=Schmitz |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Lindahl tax]], a method proposed by Erik Lindahl for financing public goods\n* [[Private-collective model of innovation]], which explains the creation of public goods by private investors\n* [[Public bad]]\n* [[Public goods game]], a standard of experimental economics\n* [[Public works]], government-financed constructions\n* [[Tragedy of the anticommons]]\n* [[Anti-rival good]]\n* [[Rivalry (economics)]]\n* [[Quadratic funding]], a mechanism to allocate funding for the production of public goods based on democratic principles\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite journal |author=Coase, Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Coase |title=The Lighthouse in Economics |journal=Journal of Law and Economics |year=1974 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=357\u2013376 |doi=10.1086/466796}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Nicola Acocella|Acoella, Nicola]] (2006), \u2018''Distributive issues in the provision and use of global public goods''\u2019, in: \u2018''Studi economici''\u2019, 88(1): 23-42.\n* {{cite journal |author=Lipsey, Richard |authorlink=Richard Lipsey |title=Economics |year=2008 |issue=11 |pages=281\u2013283}}\n* [[Jonathan Zittrain|Zittrain, Jonathan]], ''[[The Future of the Internet: And How to Stop It]]''. 2008\n* [[Lawrence Lessig|Lessig, Lawrence]], ''[[Code: Version 2.0|Code 2.0]]'', Chapter 7, What Things Regulate\n\n== External links ==\n{{Library resources box}}\n*[http://www.linfo.org/public_good.html ''Public Goods: A Brief Introduction''], by The Linux Information Project (LINFO)\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |authorlink1=Tyler Cowen |editor=[[David R.

Samuelson]] is usually credited as the first economist to develop the theory of public goods. In his classic 1954 paper ''The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure'',<ref>{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |authorlink=Paul Samuelson |title=The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |year=1954 |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=387\u201389 |doi=10.2307/1925895 |jstor=1925895}}<br />See also {{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |year=1955 |title=Diagrammatic Exposition of a Theory of Public Expenditure |journal=Review of Economics and Statistics |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=350\u201356 |jstor=1925849 |doi=10.2307/1925849}}</ref> he defined a public good, or as he called it in the paper a \"collective consumption good\", as follows:\n\n<blockquote>[goods] which all enjoy in common in the sense that each individual's consumption of such a good leads to no subtractions from any other individual's consumption of that good...</blockquote>\n\nThis is the property that has become known as ''[[Nonrival good|non-rivalry]]''. A ''pure public good'' exhibits a second property called ''[[Non-excludable good|non-excludability]]'': that is, it is impossible to exclude any individuals from consuming the good.\n\nHowever, many goods may satisfy the two public good conditions (''[[Non-rival good|non-rivalry]]'' and ''[[non-excludability]]'') only to a certain extent or only some of the time. These goods are known as ''impure public goods''.\n\nThe opposite of a public good is a ''[[private good]]'', which does not possess these properties. A loaf of bread, for example, is a private good; its owner can exclude others from using it, and once it has been consumed, it cannot be used by others.\n\nA good that is rivalrous but ''non-excludable'' is sometimes called a ''[[common-pool resource]]''. Such goods raise similar issues to public goods: the mirror to the ''public goods problem'' for this case is the '[[tragedy of the commons]]'. For example, it is so difficult to enforce restrictions on [[deep-sea fishing]] that the world's [[fish stock]]s can be seen as a non-excludable resource, but one which is finite and diminishing.\n\n=== Definition matrix ===\n{{Good (economics)}}\n[[Elinor Ostrom]] proposed additional modifications to the classification of goods to identify fundamental differences that affect the incentives facing individuals<ref>{{cite book |last1=Elinor |first1=Ostrom |title=Understanding Institutional Diversity |date=2005 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ}}</ref>\n\n# Replacing the term \"rivalry of consumption\" with \"subtractability of use\".\n# Conceptualizing subtractability of use and excludability to vary from low to high rather than characterizing them as either present or absent.\n# Overtly adding a very important fourth type of good\u2014common-pool resources\u2014that shares the attribute of subtractability with private goods and difficulty of exclusion with public goods. Forests, water systems, fisheries, and the global atmosphere are all common-pool resources of immense importance for the survival of humans on this earth.\n# Changing the name of a \"club\" good to a \"toll\" good since many goods that share these characteristics are provided by small scale public as well as private associations.\n\n=== Challenges in identifying public goods ===\n\nThe definition of non-excludability states that it is impossible to exclude individuals from consumption. Technology now allows radio or TV broadcasts to be encrypted such that persons without a special decoder are excluded from the broadcast. Many forms of [[information good]]s have characteristics of public goods. For example, a poem can be read by many people without reducing the consumption of that good by others; in this sense, it is non-rivalrous. Similarly, the information in most patents can be used by any party without reducing consumption of that good by others. [[Official statistics]] provide a clear example of information goods that are public goods, since they are created to be non-excludable.  Creative works may be excludable in some circumstances, however: the individual who wrote the poem may decline to share it with others by not publishing it. [[Copyright]]s and [[patent]]s both encourage the creation of such non-rival goods by providing temporary monopolies, or, in the terminology of public goods, providing a legal mechanism to enforce excludability for a limited period of time. For public goods, the \"lost revenue\" of the producer of the good is not part of the definition: a public good is a good whose consumption does not reduce any other's consumption of that good.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Demsetz |first=Harold |title=Full Access The Private Production of Public Goods |journal=Journal of Law and Economics |date=October 1970 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=293\u2013306 |jstor=229060 |doi=10.1086/466695}}</ref>\n\nDebate has been generated among economists whether such a category of \"public goods\" exists. [[Steven Shavell]] has suggested the following:\n<blockquote>when professional economists talk about public goods they do ''not'' mean that there are a general category of goods that share the same economic characteristics, manifest the same dysfunctions, and that may thus benefit from pretty similar corrective solutions...there is merely an infinite series of particular problems (some of [[overproduction]], some of underproduction, and so on), each with a particular solution that cannot be deduced from the theory, but that instead would depend on local empirical factors.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boyle |first=James |title=Shamans, Software, and Spleens: Law and the Construction of the Information Society |year=1996 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Mass. |isbn=978-0-674-80522-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/shamanssoftwares00boyl/page/268 268] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/shamanssoftwares00boyl/page/268 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nCommon confusion is that public goods are goods provided by the [[public sector]]. Although it is often the case that government is involved in producing public goods, this is not necessarily the case. Public goods may be ''naturally'' available. They may be produced by private individuals and firms, by non-state [[collective action]], or they may not be produced at all.<ref name=\"Touffut 2006 p. 26\">{{cite book |last=Touffut |first=J.P. |title=Advancing Public Goods |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing, Incorporated |series=The Cournot Centre for Economic Studies |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-84720-184-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HW_KRCi4T_0C&pg=PA26 |access-date=27 August 2018 |page=26}}</ref>\n\nThe theoretical concept of public goods does not distinguish with regard to the geographical region in which a good may be produced or consumed. However, some theorists such as [[Inge Kaul]] use the term \"[[global public good]]\" for public goods which is non-rival and non-excludable throughout the whole world, as opposed to a public good which exists in just one national area. Knowledge has been held to be an example of a global public good,<ref>[[Joseph E. Stiglitz]], \"Knowledge as a Global Public Good\" in ''Global Public Goods'', {{ISBN|978-0-19-513052-2}}</ref> but also as a commons, the [[knowledge commons]].<ref name=\"ostrom\">{{cite book |title=Understanding Knowledge as a Commons: From Theory to Practice |last=Hess |first=Charlotte |author2=Ostrom, Elinor |year=2007 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-262-08357-7 |pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Samuelson condition.png|thumb|Aggregate demand (\u03a3MB) is the sum of individual demands (MBi)]]\nGraphically, non-rivalry means that if each of several individuals has a demand curve for a public good, then the individual demand curves are summed vertically to get the aggregate demand curve for the public good. This is in contrast to the procedure for deriving the aggregate demand for a private good, where individual demands are summed horizontally.\n\nSome writers have used the term \"public good\" to refer only to non-excludable \"pure public goods\" and refer to excludable public goods as \"[[club goods]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=James M.

Some goods, like [[orphan drug]]s, require special governmental incentives to be produced, but cannot be classified as public goods since they do not fulfill the above requirements (non-excludable and non-rivalrous.) Law enforcement, streets, libraries, museums, and education are commonly misclassified as public goods, but they are technically classified in economic terms as quasi-public goods because excludability ''is'' possible, but they do still fit some of the characteristics of public goods.<ref>Pucciarelli F., [[Andreas Kaplan]] (2016) Competition and Strategy in Higher Education: Managing Complexity and Uncertainty, Business Horizons, Volume 59</ref><ref name=ppp>{{cite book |author1=Campbell R.

No ship's use detracts from that of others, but since most of the benefit of a lighthouse accrues to ships using particular [[port]]s, lighthouse maintenance can be profitably bundled with port fees ([[Ronald Coase]], ''[[The Lighthouse in Economics]]'' 1974). This has been sufficient to fund actual lighthouses.\n\n[[Technological progress]] can create new public goods. The most simple examples are street lights, which are relatively recent inventions (by historical standards). One person's enjoyment of them does not detract from other persons' enjoyment, and it currently would be prohibitively expensive to charge individuals separately for the amount of light they presumably use. [[Official statistics]] are another example.  The government's ability to collect, process and provide high-quality information to guide decision-making at all levels has been strongly advanced by technological progress. On the other hand, a public good's status may change over time. Technological progress can significantly impact excludability of traditional public goods: encryption allows [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] to sell individual access to their programming. The costs for electronic [[road pricing]] have fallen dramatically, paving the way for detailed billing based on actual use.\n\nSome question whether defense is a public good.

The production of public goods results in positive [[externality|externalities]] which are not remunerated. If private organizations do not reap all the benefits of a public good which they have produced, their incentives to produce it voluntarily might be insufficient. Consumers can take advantage of public goods without contributing sufficiently to their creation. This is called the [[free rider problem]], or occasionally, the \"easy rider problem\" (because consumers' contributions will be small but non-zero). If too many consumers decide to \"free-ride\", private costs exceed private benefits and the incentive to provide the good or service through the market disappears. The market thus fails to provide a good or service for which there is a need.<ref>{{Cite book |last=[[Ray Powell (disambiguation)|Ray Powell]] |title=AQA AS Economics |edition=paperback |date=June 2008 |publisher=Philip Allan |page=352 |chapter=10: Private goods, public goods and externalities |isbn=978-0-340-94750-0}}</ref>\n\nThe free rider problem depends on a conception of the human being as ''[[homo economicus]]'': purely rational and also purely selfish\u2014extremely individualistic, considering only those benefits and costs that directly affect him or her. Public goods give such a person an incentive to be a free rider.\n\nFor example, consider national defense, a standard example of a pure public good. Suppose ''homo economicus'' thinks about exerting some extra effort to defend the nation. The benefits to the individual of this effort would be very low, since the benefits would be distributed among all of the millions of other people in the country. There is also a very high possibility that he or she could get injured or killed during the course of his or her military service.\n\nOn the other hand, the free rider knows that he or she cannot be excluded from the benefits of national defense, regardless of whether he or she contributes to it. There is also no way that these benefits can be split up and distributed as individual parcels to people. The free rider would not voluntarily exert any extra effort, unless there is some inherent pleasure or material reward for doing so (for example, money paid by the government, as with an all-volunteer army or [[mercenaries]]). The free-riding problem is even more complicated than it was thought to be until recently.  Any time non-excludability results in failure to pay the true marginal value (often called the \"demand revelation problem\"), it will also result in failure to generate proper income levels, since households will not give up valuable leisure if they cannot individually increment a good.<ref>Graves, P. E., [http://works.bepress.com/philip_graves/1 \"A Note on the Valuation of Collective Goods: Overlooked Input Market Free Riding for Non-Individually Incrementable Goods] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630044449/http://works.bepress.com/philip_graves/1/ |date=30 June 2013 }}\", ''The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy'' 9.1 (2009).</ref> This implies that, for public goods without strong special interest support, under-provision is likely since benefit-cost analyses are being conducted at the wrong income levels, and all of the ungenerated income would have been spent on the public good, apart from general equilibrium considerations.\n\nIn the case of [[information good]]s, an inventor of a new product may benefit all of society, but hardly anyone is willing to pay for the invention if they can benefit from it for free. In the case of an information good, however, because of its characteristics of non-excludability and also because of almost zero reproduction costs, commoditization is difficult and not always efficient even from a neoclassical economic point of view.<ref>{{cite book |last=Babe |first=Robert |title=Essay in Information, Public Policy and Political Economy |year=1995 |publisher=Westview Press |location=University of Ottawa |chapter=Chapter 3}}</ref>\n\n== Efficient production levels of public goods ==\n{{Essay|section|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe [[Pareto optimum]] provision of a public good in a society is where the combined sum of the [[marginal rate of substitution]] between private goods and a given public good of all individuals is equal to the [[marginal rate of transformation]]. This contrasts to the Pareto optimality condition of private goods, in which each consumers' marginal rate of substitution is equal; as is the societies marginal rate of transformation.<ref>Brown, C. V.; Jackson, P. M. (1986), \"The Economic Analysis of Public Goods\", ''Public Sector Economics'', 3rd Edition, Chapter 3, pp. 48\u201379.</ref>\n\nAn example is a community of just two consumers and the government is considering whether or not to build a [[public park]]. One person is prepared to pay up to $200 for its use, while the other is willing to pay up to $100. The total value to the two individuals of having the park is $300. If it can be produced for $225, there is a $75 gain on its production since it provides services that the community values at $300 at a cost of only $225.\n\nRegardless of the method of providing public goods, the efficient level of such provision is still being subjected to economic analysis. For instance, the [[Samuelson condition]] calculates the efficient level of public goods production to be where the ratio of the [[marginalism|marginal]] [[social cost]] of public and private goods production equals the ratio of the [[marginal social benefit]] of public and private goods production.\n\n== Ownership ==\nAn important question regarding public goods is whether they should be owned by the public or the private sector. Economic theorists such as [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]] (1995) argue that ownership matters for investment incentives when contracts are incomplete.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Firms, Contracts, and Financial Structure |last=Hart |first=Oliver |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |isbn= |location= |pages=}}</ref> The incomplete contracting paradigm has been applied to public goods by [[Tim Besley|Besley]] and [[Maitreesh Ghatak|Ghatak]] (2001).<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Government Versus Private Ownership of Public Goods |url=http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/116/4/1343 |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |year=2001 |issn=0033-5533 |pages=1343\u201372 |volume=116 |issue=4 |doi=10.1162/003355301753265598 |first=Timothy |last=Besley |first2=Maitreesh |last2=Ghatak|citeseerx=10.1.1.584.6739 }}</ref> They consider the government and a non-governmental organization (NGO) who can both make investments to provide a public good. Besley and Ghatak show that the party who has a larger valuation for the public good should be the owner, regardless of whether the government or the NGO has a better investment technology. This result contrasts with the case of private goods studied by Hart (1995), where the party with the better investment technology should be the owner. However, more recently it has been shown that the investment technology matters also in the public-good case when a party is indispensable or when there are bargaining frictions between the government and the NGO.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Nature of human capital, technology and ownership of public goods |journal=Journal of Public Economics |year=2012 |pages=939\u201345 |volume=96 |series=Fiscal Federalism |issue=11\u201312 |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2012.07.005 |first=Maija |last=Halonen-Akatwijuka|citeseerx=10.1.1.173.3797 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Government versus private ownership of public goods: The role of bargaining frictions |journal=Journal of Public Economics |year=2015 |pages=23\u201331 |volume=132 |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2015.09.009 |first=Patrick W. |last=Schmitz |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Lindahl tax]], a method proposed by Erik Lindahl for financing public goods\n* [[Private-collective model of innovation]], which explains the creation of public goods by private investors\n* [[Public bad]]\n* [[Public goods game]], a standard of experimental economics\n* [[Public works]], government-financed constructions\n* [[Tragedy of the anticommons]]\n* [[Anti-rival good]]\n* [[Rivalry (economics)]]\n* [[Quadratic funding]], a mechanism to allocate funding for the production of public goods based on democratic principles\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite journal |author=Coase, Ronald |authorlink=Ronald Coase |title=The Lighthouse in Economics |journal=Journal of Law and Economics |year=1974 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=357\u2013376 |doi=10.1086/466796}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Nicola Acocella|Acoella, Nicola]] (2006), \u2018''Distributive issues in the provision and use of global public goods''\u2019, in: \u2018''Studi economici''\u2019, 88(1): 23-42.\n* {{cite journal |author=Lipsey, Richard |authorlink=Richard Lipsey |title=Economics |year=2008 |issue=11 |pages=281\u2013283}}\n* [[Jonathan Zittrain|Zittrain, Jonathan]], ''[[The Future of the Internet: And How to Stop It]]''. 2008\n* [[Lawrence Lessig|Lessig, Lawrence]], ''[[Code: Version 2.0|Code 2.0]]'', Chapter 7, What Things Regulate\n\n== External links ==\n{{Library resources box}}\n*[http://www.linfo.org/public_good.html ''Public Goods: A Brief Introduction''], by The Linux Information Project (LINFO)\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |authorlink1=Tyler Cowen |editor=[[David R.
