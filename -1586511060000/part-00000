Allseas acquired the former bulk carrier \u201cNatalie Bolten\u201d in 1985 and converted it for DP pipelay at the Boele shipyard in Bolnes, the Netherlands. The vessel was christened ''[https://allseas.com/equipment/lorelay/ Lorelay]'' in Rotterdam on 26 April 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/swan-revival-means-1200-jobs-1340756.html|title=Swan revival means 1,200 jobs|website=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref> ''Lorelay'' immediately entered service and successfully executed her first pipelay contract, the 8-inch, 1.8-km Helder A-B pipeline, for Unocal in the Dutch sector of the North Sea.\n\nIn 1987, the company declared its intention to build a vessel capable of lifting entire offshore platforms. The initial idea featured two rigidly connected, self-propelled supertankers, with a large slot at the bows to install platform topsides in one piece.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-96/issue-18/in-this-issue/general-interest/major-deepwater-pipelay-vessel-starts-work-in-north-sea.html|title=Major deepwater pipelay vessel starts work in North Sea|website=www.ogj.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, the company established itself a major player in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. In 1992, the company acquired the former bulkhead carrier \u201cTrenchwood\u201d for conversion to ''[https://allseas.com/equipment/solitaire/ Solitaire],'' the world's largest pipelay vessel. Allseas awarded the conversion contract to Sembawang Shipyards in Singapore on a lump sum basis; however, due to ongoing problems the contract was terminated in 1995.

{"title_page": "Nirenberg and Matthaei experiment", "text_new": "The '''Nirenberg and Matthaei experiment''' was a scientific experiment performed in May 1961 by [[Marshall W. Nirenberg]] and his post-doctoral fellow, [[J. Heinrich Matthaei]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). The experiment deciphered the first of the 64 triplet codons in the [[genetic code]] by using [[nucleic acid]] [[homopolymer]]s to translate specific [[amino acid]]s.\n\nIn the experiment, an extract from bacterial cells that could make [[protein]] even when no intact living [[cell (biology)|cells]] were present was prepared. Adding an artificial form of [[RNA]] consisting entirely of [[uracil]]-containing nucleotides (''polyuridylic acid'' or poly-U), to this extract caused it to make a protein composed entirely of the amino acid [[phenylalanine]]. This experiment cracked the first [[codon]] of the [[genetic code]] and showed that RNA controlled the production of specific types of protein.\n\n== Background ==\nDiscoveries by [[Frederick Griffith]] and improved on by [[Oswald Avery]] discovered that the substance responsible for producing inheritable change in the disease-causing bacteria (''Streptococcus pneumoniae)'' was neither a protein nor a lipid, rather deoxyribonucleic acid ([[DNA]]). In 1944, he and his colleagues [[Colin Munro MacLeod|Colin MacLeod]] and [[Maclyn McCarty]] suggested that DNA was responsible for transferring genetic information. Later, [[Erwin Chargaff]](1950) discovered that the makeup of DNA differs from one species to another. These experiments helped pave the way for the discovery of the structure of DNA. In 1953, with the help of [[Maurice Wilkins]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]]\u2019s [[X-ray crystallography]], [[James D. Watson|James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] proposed DNA is structured as a [[double helix]].<ref>{{cite book | title= iGenetics: A Molecular Approach, 3rd edition | author=Russell P. |year=2010| publisher= Pearson/Benjamin Cummings}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, one main DNA mystery scientists needed to figure out was the number of bases found in each code word, or [[codon]], during [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. Scientists knew there was a total of four bases ([[guanine]], [[cytosine]], [[adenine]], and [[thymine]]). They also knew that were 20 known [[amino acids]]. [[George Gamow]] suggested that the genetic code was made of three nucleotides per amino acid. He reasoned that because there are 20 amino acids and only four bases, the coding units could not be single (4 combinations) or pairs (only 16 combinations).

Nirenberg]] and his post-doctoral fellow, [[J. Heinrich Matthaei]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). The experiment deciphered the first of the 64 triplet codons in the [[genetic code]] by using [[nucleic acid]] [[homopolymer]]s to translate specific [[amino acid]]s.\n\nIn the experiment, an extract from bacterial cells that could make [[protein]] even when no intact living [[cell (biology)|cells]] were present was prepared. Adding an artificial form of [[RNA]] consisting entirely of [[uracil]]-containing nucleotides (''polyuridylic acid'' or poly-U), to this extract caused it to make a protein composed entirely of the amino acid [[phenylalanine]]. This experiment cracked the first [[codon]] of the [[genetic code]] and showed that RNA controlled the production of specific types of protein.\n\n== Background ==\nDiscoveries by [[Frederick Griffith]] and improved on by [[Oswald Avery]] discovered that the substance responsible for producing inheritable change in the disease-causing bacteria (''Streptococcus pneumoniae)'' was neither a protein nor a lipid, rather deoxyribonucleic acid ([[DNA]]). In 1944, he and his colleagues [[Colin Munro MacLeod|Colin MacLeod]] and [[Maclyn McCarty]] suggested that DNA was responsible for transferring genetic information. Later, [[Erwin Chargaff]](1950) discovered that the makeup of DNA differs from one species to another. These experiments helped pave the way for the discovery of the structure of DNA. In 1953, with the help of [[Maurice Wilkins]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]]\u2019s [[X-ray crystallography]], [[James D.

Scientists knew there was a total of four bases ([[guanine]], [[cytosine]], [[adenine]], and [[thymine]]). They also knew that were 20 known [[amino acids]]. [[George Gamow]] suggested that the genetic code was made of three nucleotides per amino acid. He reasoned that because there are 20 amino acids and only four bases, the coding units could not be single (4 combinations) or pairs (only 16 combinations). Rather, he thought triplets (64 possible combinations) were the coding unit of the genetic code.

However, upon arriving in Baroda, he realized that none of the [[Hindu Religion|Hindu]] hotels would allow his to stay due to his lower caste. He found a [[Parsi]] inn, but here, non-Parsis were not allowed to stay. He and the Parsi inn-keeper reached a compromise, where by Ambedkar gave his name as a Parsi, and was allowed to stay. However, this fraud (his words) was discovered by other Parsis, and on the eleventh day of his stay, a group of angry Parsi men, armed with sticks, arrived to remove him from the inn.\nHe had to leave the inn that very day, and not having a place to stay, was forced to leave Baroda and return to [[Bombay]] to find work elsewhere.\n\n===Section 3: Pride, awkwardness and a dangerous accident in Chalisgaon===\n\nIn this section, Ambedkar recounts an embarrassing accident that occurred to him in the village of [[Chalisgaon]] ([[Maharashtra]]) in 1929. He had been appointed as a member to a committee  instituted by the [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay government]], to investigate allegations of oppression and grievances of untouchables. After carrying out investigations in the district of [[Khandesh]], en route to Bombay, he disembarked at Chalisgaon to investigate a case of social boycott by Hindus against untouchables of that village.\nThe untouchables of the village requested him to spend the night with them, but as the tonga walas considered it below their dignity to cart an untouchable (Ambedkar), the villagers had to hire a tonga (horse-driven carriage) and ride it on their own. They did so, however the untouchable riding the carriage was a novice, and had an accident as they were crossing the river on a culvert. Ambedkar was thrown off the carriage as a wheel got stuck between the stones of the [[culvert]]. This resulted in multiple injuries to Ambedkar and a fracture. The horse and carriage fell into the river.\n\nAmbedkar feels that the pride and dignity of the village untouchables (they did not want their visitor to have to walk to the village) made them take undue risks with the safety of their visitor. He also realized that even lowly menial tongawalas felt that a highly educated [[Barristers in England and Wales|barrister at law]] untouchable was below them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Selected works of B.R.Ambedkar|pages=4072\u20134090|url=https://drambedkarbooks.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/selected-work-of-dr-b-r-ambedkar.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Section 4: Polluting the water in the fort of Daulatabad===\n\nThis section relates to an incident in 1934 and showed Ambedkar how Muslims also treated untouchables as lower caste.\n\nAmbedkar and a group of his friends had gone to visit [[Daulatabad fort]], during a trip to [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] (then in the [[Nizam state]] of [[Hyderabad]]). On arriving at the fort, Ambedkar's group washed themselves with water kept in a tank at the fort entrance. However, after a few minutes, an old [[Mohammedan]] started to run after them, shouting \"the Dheds (untouchables) have polluted our water\" and soon there was a commotion, with a large group of Muslism shooting at Ambedkar's group and at the local untouchable community. A riot nearly resulted till Ambedkar asked them whether they would have behaved in the same manner if an untouchable who had converted to [[Islam]] had used that water.\n\n===Section 5: A doctor refuses to give proper care and a woman dies.===\n\nThis section consists of a letter which was published in [[Young India]], a journal published by [[M.K.Gandhi]] in its issue of 12 December 1929. It recounts the sad experience of a [[harijan]] in [[Kathiawar]], whose wife fell sick soon after giving birth to a child. The Hindu ([[Brahmin]]) doctor refused to treat her directly, or see them in the house. The doctor finally agreed to see the sick lady if she were brought outside the harijan colony, and treated here without touching her, by passing the thermometer indirectly through a Muslim. Some medicine was given to her, and when her condition aggravated, the doctor refused to see her. \nShe died  subsequently.\n\n===Section 6: A young clerk is abused and threatened and threatened until he gives up his job===\n\nThis section recounts the narrated experience of a [[Bhangi]] boy, recounted on 6 March 1938 at a Bhangi meeting in [[Dadar]], Bombay. The educated boy got employment as a [[Talati]] in the government district offices of  [[Borsad]], [[Kheda]], in what is now [[Gujarat]]. However, he was refused accommodation there, being an untouchable. Neither did the untouchables of the village accommodate him, fearing the wrath of Hindus who felt that the bhangi boy was aiming for a job which was beyond him.\n\nAt the government office, his colleagues discriminated against him, treated him badly and did not allow him to drink water when thirsty for fear of the water getting polluted by his touch.\nUltimately, matters only got worse, with a large crowd of locals threatening to kill him.\n\nHe left this job and returned home.\n\n==First publication and later editions==\n\nIn 1990, the People's Education Society published this work as a booklet. It was subsequently published by the Education Department, Government of Maharashtra, in 1993 along with some collections in ''Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar: Writings and Speeches, Vol. 12,  Part I.''\n\n== See also ==\n* [[B.
