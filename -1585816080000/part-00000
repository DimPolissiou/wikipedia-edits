Films focused primarily on car review, motoring challenges, and road trip journeys, often based around those of ''Top Gear'', such as a challenge in which the presenters have to purchase a class of vehicle and see which is the best through a series of tests given through text messages from the show's producer. Alongside these episodes, the programme's format between 2016 to 2019 also included special episodes based around the [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)#Specials|specials of ''Top Gear'']], focused on the presenters travelling on journeys in a specific type of vehicle or class within a foreign locale.\n\nLike ''Top Gear'', car reviews on ''The Grand Tour'' functioned in a similar manner in which the presenters, either on their own or with their colleagues, take a look at various cars and test them out on various aspects such as performance, handling, and quality. Reviews are conducted in varying locales abroad, or within the United Kingdom, including a specially designed racetrack, parallel to the ''Top Gear'' Test Track, called the \"Eboladrome\". The track is not only used for reviews, but also for conducting timed laps of vehicles that are reviewed, except for ten cars which were timed outside of filming before the launch of the first series. Timed laps are conducted by a professional driver assigned to the programme - while the first series involved former [[NASCAR]] driver [[Mike Skinner (racing driver)|Mike Skinner]], who was contracted to operate under the name \"The American\" and portray a stereotypical [[redneck]] accent and viewpoints alongside scripted character traits,<ref name=\"telegraph-hogan-20161118\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/the-grand-tour-vs-top-gear-how-do-they-compare/|title=''The Grand Tour'' vs ''Top Gear'': how do they compare?|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Michael|last=Hogan|date=18 November 2016|accessdate=26 November 2016|quote= [Test driver] Mike Skinner.

presenters sat around a [[trestle table]] and the audience seated in front of them.<ref name=\"telegraph-hogan-20161118\"/> Initially, the first series involved these segments being filmed within a travelling tent that was set up in various countries, with audiences acquired from the local population at the site as part of an emphasis that the programme was on a \"[[grand tour]]\" around the world.<ref name=\"telegraph-hogan-20161118\"/> However, Hammond's crash in Switzerland and Clarkson's pneumonia prior to the second series, led to the use of a travelling tent being dropped in favour of a more fixed location, resulting in studio segments being filmed on the outskirts of [[Chipping Norton]] for the second and third series.<ref name=\"grubb-20170909\" /> These live-audience segments act as breaks between pre-recorded films, much like in ''Top Gear'', and operated on a similar format. Throughout all three series, the presenters often used a discussion period on various topics within a segment entitled \"Conversation Street\", which often involving a running gag of it opening  with an intro of the presenters in silhouettes conducting something that often had something comedic and/or unusual occurs during the short interval.\n\nCelebrities were not initially part of the programme to begin with, due to concerns over legal issues that the [[BBC]] could raise if it competed against the celebrity format used in ''Top Gear''. As such, the programme created a humorous segment for the first series entitled \"Celebrity Brain Crash\", which involved celebrities being \"killed\" in an accident while making their way to the presenter's tent - the segment was done for comedic effect, and either involved an actual celebrity who was filmed briefly for the segment before their death is staged outside the tent's location or with a look-alike, or involving someone representing them, despite not being clearly identifiable. This segment was later dropped in response to complaints made by viewers,<ref name= \"Second Series Changes\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://drivetribe.com/p/the-secret-story-behind-the-grand-YpKc9wrzR6K4cetBcPJ8EA?iid=c-d5FQraQraORx4ALaUP7w |title=The Secret Story Behind The Grand Tour's Celebrity Braincrash |author= Reed, Jason |publisher=Shifting Lanes |date=24 January 2018 |accessdate=26 January 2018}}</ref> leading to the decision that celebrities would be a part of the programme for the second series in a new segment entitled \"Celebrity Face Off\". Much like ''Top Gear's'' \"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\", the segment involved two celebrities, who shared similar backgrounds or connections to certain elements (e.g. magicians) who competed against each other on a separate race track, to see who was the fastest, alongside conducting interviews with the presenters. The timed laps for this segment not only involved a different track, but also used a [[Jaguar F-Type|Jaguar F-Type R-Dynamic]] coupe to create the lap time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/the-grand-tour/news/a844006/the-grand-tour-season-2-celebrity-guests-hoff-jack-bauer-luke-evans/ |title=The Grand Tour season 2 confirms celebrity guests including The Hoff, Jack Bauer and Luke Evans |author=McCreesh, Louise |website=[[Digital Spy]] |date=27 November 2017 |accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref> The use of celebrities was later dropped prior to filming of the third series, to dedicate more time to films.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wheels.ca/news/james-may-talks-grand-tour/|title=James May on Stripey Jumpers, Horrid Noises, and Season 3 of The Grand Tour|author= Williams, Evan |publisher=Wheels.Ca |date=8 January 2019 |accessdate=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 800\n| image1 = Raf-wroughton-the-grand-tour-eboladrome-test-track-20161123.svg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The \"Eboladrome\" test track at [[RAF Wroughton]], used on ''The Grand Tour'' between 2016 and 2019 for timed laps of reviewed cars.\n| image2 = Enstone-airfield-the-grand-tour-gravel-test-track-20171223.svg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = The gravel course at [[Enstone Airfield]], used on ''The Grand Tour'' for \"Celebrity Face Off\", but only for the second series.\n}}{{-}}\n\n====''The Grand Tour'' race tracks====\nWhen the programme was first conceived and created, the production team opted for the creation of a dedicated test track for the purpose of being used for reviews of testing of vehicles by presenters, alongside the establishment of lap times by cars that are reviewed. The track was eventually sited at the former [[RAF Wroughton]] airbase, with its layout consisting of two loops - one large and one small - connected by a single stretch of tarmac between them and christened as the \"Eboladrome\", due to the design of the track resembling the structure of the [[Ebola virus]]. The track was designed to \"trip cars up\" and included sections devised under a humorous arrangement, such as \"Isn't Straight\", \"Your Name Here\", \"Old Lady's House\", \"Substation\" and \"Field of Sheep\". The track was dropped from use from the programme after the third series.\n\nFor the second series, the production team decided to create a second track for the specific purpose of being used in the newly created celebrity segment \"Celebrity Face Off\". They eventually decided to situate the new track at [[Enstone Airfield]], close to the fixed studio tent location - a site originally planned for use with ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.<ref name=\"rufford-20171129\">{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.driving.co.uk/news/interview/clarkson-hammond-and-may-on-the-grand-tour-season-2/|work=The Sunday Times: Driving|title=Our year from hell: Clarkson, Hammond and May on ''The Grand Tour'' season 2, overcoming disaster, 'that' crash and ill-health|first=Nick|last=Rufford|date=29 November 2017|accessdate=14 December 2017|quote=The show has a new test track in Enstone, ... there planning problems when [Clarkson] tried once before to use the Enstone track, back in Top Gear days ...

Films focused primarily on car review, motoring challenges, and road trip journeys, often based around those of ''Top Gear'', such as a challenge in which the presenters have to purchase a class of vehicle and see which is the best through a series of tests given through text messages from the show's producer. Alongside these episodes, the programme's format between 2016 to 2019 also included special episodes based around the [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)#Specials|specials of ''Top Gear'']], focused on the presenters travelling on journeys in a specific type of vehicle or class within a foreign locale.\n\nLike ''Top Gear'', car reviews on ''The Grand Tour'' functioned in a similar manner in which the presenters, either on their own or with their colleagues, take a look at various cars and test them out on various aspects such as performance, handling, and quality. Reviews are conducted in varying locales abroad, or within the United Kingdom, including a specially designed racetrack, parrallel to the ''Top Gear'' Test Track, called the \"Eboladrome\". The track is not only used for reviews, but also for conducting timed laps of vehicles that are reviewed, except for ten cars which were timed outside of filming before the launch of the first series. Timed laps are conducted by a professional driver assigned to the programme - while the first series involved former [[NASCAR]] driver [[Mike Skinner (racing driver)|Mike Skinner]], who was contracted to operate under the name \"The American\" and portray a stereotypical [[redneck]] accent and viewpoints alongside scripted character traits,<ref name=\"telegraph-hogan-20161118\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/the-grand-tour-vs-top-gear-how-do-they-compare/|title=''The Grand Tour'' vs ''Top Gear'': how do they compare?|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Michael|last=Hogan|date=18 November 2016|accessdate=26 November 2016|quote= [Test driver] Mike Skinner.

presenters sat around a [[trestle table]] and the audience seated in front of them.<ref name=\"telegraph-hogan-20161118\"/> Initially, the first series involved these segments being filmed within a travelling tent that was set up in various countries, with audiences acquired from the local population at the site as part of an emphasis that the programme was on a \"[[grand tour]]\" around the world.<ref name=\"telegraph-hogan-20161118\"/> However, Hammond's crash in Switzerland and Clarkson's pneumonia prior to the second series, led to the use of a travelling tent being dropped in favour of a more fixed location, resulting in studio segments being filmed on the outskirts of [[Chipping Norton]] for the second and third series.<ref name=\"grubb-20170909\" /> These live-audience segments act as breaks between pre-recorded films, much like in ''Top Gear'', and operated on a similar format. Throughout all three series, the presenters often used a discussion period on various topics within a segment entitled \"Conversation Street\", which often involving a running gag of it opening  with an intro of the presenters in silhouettes conducting something that often had something comedic and/or unusual occurs during the short interval.\n\nCelebrities were not initially part of the programme to begin with, due to concerns over legal issues that the [[BBC]] could raise if it competed against the celebrity format used in ''Top Gear''. As such, the programme created a humorous segment for the first series entitled \"Celebrity Brain Crash\", which involved celebrities being \"killed\" in an accident while making their way to the presenter's tent - the segment was done for comedic effect, and either involved an actual celebrity who was filmed briefly for the segment before their death is staged outside the tent's location or with a look-alike, or involving someone representing them, despite not being clearly identifiable. This segment was later dropped in response to complaints made by viewers,<ref name= \"Second Series Changes\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://drivetribe.com/p/the-secret-story-behind-the-grand-YpKc9wrzR6K4cetBcPJ8EA?iid=c-d5FQraQraORx4ALaUP7w |title=The Secret Story Behind The Grand Tour's Celebrity Braincrash |author= Reed, Jason |publisher=Shifting Lanes |date=24 January 2018 |accessdate=26 January 2018}}</ref> leading to the decision that celebrities would be a part of the programme for the second series in a new segment entitled \"Celebrity Face Off\". Much like ''Top Gear's'' \"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\", the segment involved two celebrities, who shared similar backgrounds or connections to certain elements (e.g. magicians) who competed against each other on a separate race track, to see who was the fastest, alongside conducting interviews with the presenters. The timed laps for this segment not only involved a different track, but also used a [[Jaguar F-Type|Jaguar F-Type R-Dynamic]] coupe to create the lap time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/the-grand-tour/news/a844006/the-grand-tour-season-2-celebrity-guests-hoff-jack-bauer-luke-evans/ |title=The Grand Tour season 2 confirms celebrity guests including The Hoff, Jack Bauer and Luke Evans |author=McCreesh, Louise |website=[[Digital Spy]] |date=27 November 2017 |accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref> The use of celebrities was later dropped prior to filming of the third series, to dedicate more time to films.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wheels.ca/news/james-may-talks-grand-tour/|title=James May on Stripey Jumpers, Horrid Noises, and Season 3 of The Grand Tour|author= Williams, Evan |publisher=Wheels.Ca |date=8 January 2019 |accessdate=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 800\n| image1 = Raf-wroughton-the-grand-tour-eboladrome-test-track-20161123.svg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = The \"Eboladrome\" test track at [[RAF Wroughton]], used on ''The Grand Tour'' between 2016 and 2019 for timed laps of reviewed cars.\n| image2 = Enstone-airfield-the-grand-tour-gravel-test-track-20171223.svg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = The gravel course at [[Enstone Airfield]], used on ''The Grand Tour'' for \"Celebrity Face Off\", but only for the second series.\n}}{{-}}\n\n====''The Grand Tour'' race tracks====\nWhen the programme was first conceived and created, the production team opted for the creation of a dedicated test track for the purpose of being used for reviews of testing of vehicles by presenters, alongside the establishment of lap times by cars that are reviewed. The track was eventually sited at the former [[RAF Wroughton]] airbase, with its layout consisting of two loops - one large and one small - connected by a single stretch of tarmac between them and christened as the \"Eboladrome\", due to the design of the track resembling the structure of the [[Ebola virus]]. The track was designed to \"trip cars up\" and included sections devised under a humorous arrangement, such as \"Isn't Straight\", \"Your Name Here\", \"Old Lady's House\", \"Substation\" and \"Field of Sheep\". The track was dropped from use from the programme after the third series.\n\nFor the second series, the production team decided to create a second track for the specific purpose of being used in the newly created celebrity segment \"Celebrity Face Off\". They eventually decided to situate the new track at [[Enstone Airfield]], close to the fixed studio tent location - a site originally planned for use with ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.<ref name=\"rufford-20171129\">{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.driving.co.uk/news/interview/clarkson-hammond-and-may-on-the-grand-tour-season-2/|work=The Sunday Times: Driving|title=Our year from hell: Clarkson, Hammond and May on ''The Grand Tour'' season 2, overcoming disaster, 'that' crash and ill-health|first=Nick|last=Rufford|date=29 November 2017|accessdate=14 December 2017|quote=The show has a new test track in Enstone, ... there planning problems when [Clarkson] tried once before to use the Enstone track, back in Top Gear days ...

For instance, Turner and Crisp had college-aged participants imagine either a positive social interaction with an older adult or imagine an outdoor scene. They then measured participants implicit attitudes using an [[Implicit Association Test]] (IAT). Their results showed that following an imagined interaction with an older adult, college-aged participants were faster to associate positive traits with the \"old\" category (e.g., stereotypically old names - Arthur, Mildred) compared to participants who imagined an outdoor scene.<ref name=\"Turner 2010 129\u2013142\">{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=R.

Researchers showed that having non-Muslim British undergraduate students imagine contact with an outgroup Muslim lead to greater intentions (measured via a [[Likert scale]] survey) to engage with Muslims in the future, compared to a control condition.<ref name=\"Husnu, 2010\" /> This work has been replicated using a variety of outgroup targets such as ethnic minorities in [[Cyprus]],<ref name=Husnu /> gay men<ref name=Crisp /> and asylum seekers.<ref name=\"Turner, West, Christie, 2013\">{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = R.

For example, one study showed that undergraduate participants who first imagined a positive interaction with an obese individual subsequently positioned chairs closer together when they thought they would be interacting and discussing society's perception of obesity with an obese individual.<ref name=\"Turner2\" />\n\n==Factors influencing effectiveness==\n===Elaborated imagined contact===\nHusnu and Crisp<ref name=\"Husnu, 2010\" /> demonstrated that greater elaboration of the imagined social interaction improved outcomes above and beyond those associated with the traditional imagined contact hypothesis paradigm. Specifically they found that by guiding Non-Muslim undergraduates to imagine contextual factors within the imagined interaction such as ''when'' and ''where'' the interaction took place improved future intentions to interact with Muslims over and above traditional instructions. Additional research also indicated elaboration increases participants estimated likelihood of befriending elderly individuals.<ref name=\"Husnu & Crisp, 2011\">{{cite journal | last1 = Husnu | first1 = S. | last2 = Crisp | first2 = R.

Stathi, Crisp, & Hogg had participants imagine either a stereotypical or non-stereotypical individual. Specifically they asked participants to either \"imagine meeting a British Muslim stranger for the first time...[who] dresses in a traditional way, avoids alcohol, reads the Koran, and prays five times a day\" or \"imagine meeting a British Muslim stranger...[who] dresses in \"western\" clothes, drinks alcohol, eats pork, and does not pray regularly\".<ref name=\"Stathi, Crisp, & Hogg (2011)\">{{cite journal | last1 = Stathi | first1 =  | year = 2011 | title = Imagining intergroup contact enables member-to-group generalization | url = | journal = Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 275\u2013284 [280] }}</ref> Their results indicated that imagining a [[stereotypical]] individual lead to greater feelings of contact-efficacy, that is how well a future interaction will go. This finding aligns with research on intergroup relations which shows that typicality of members leads to greater generalization effects compared to atypical group members.<ref name=\"Hewstone & Brown, 1986\">Hewstone, M. & Brown, R. (1986). Contact is not enough: An intergroup perspective on the 'contact hypothesis'. In M. Hewstone & R. Brown (Eds.), ''Contact and conflict in intergroup encounters'' (p. 1-44). Oxford, England: Blackwell</ref>\n\n===Individual differences===\nThere are many individual level differences that also moderate the effectiveness of imagined contact. For instance, Husnu and Crisp asked participants the extent to which they have contact with British Muslims and found greater real-life contact was associated with higher intentions to engage with Muslims following an imagined contact paradigm.<ref name=\"Husnu, 2010\" /> Individuals who feel greater [[intergroup anxiety]] also report more difficulty in imaging a positive social interaction with an outgroup member, however, this did not ultimately affect the quality of an interaction with an outgroup member following the imagined contact manipulation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Birtel|first1=M.

For instance, Turner and Crisp had college-aged participants imagine either a positive social interaction with an older adult or imagine an outdoor scene. They then measured participants implicit attitudes using an [[Implicit Association Test]] (IAT). Their results showed that following an imagined interaction with an older adult, college-aged participants were faster to associate positive traits with the \"old\" category (e.g., stereotypically old names - Arthur, Mildred) compared to participants who imagined an outdoor scene.<ref name=\"Turner 2010 129\u2013142\">{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=R.

Researchers showed that having non-Muslim British undergraduate students imagine contact with an outgroup Muslim lead to greater intentions (measured via a [[Likert scale]] survey) to engage with Muslims in the future, compared to a control condition.<ref name=\"Husnu, 2010\" /> This work has been replicated using a variety of outgroup targets such as ethnic minorities in [[Cyprus]],<ref name=Husnu /> gay men<ref name=Crisp /> and asylum seekers.<ref name=\"Turner, West, Christie, 2013\">{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = R.

For example, one study showed that undergraduate participants who first imagined a positive interaction with an obese individual subsequently positioned chairs closer together when they thought they would be interacting and discussing society's perception of obesity with an obese individual.<ref name=\"Turner2\" />\n\n==Factors influencing effectiveness==\n===Elaborated imagined contact===\nHusnu and Crisp<ref name=\"Husnu, 2010\" /> demonstrated that greater elaboration of the imagined social interaction improved outcomes above and beyond those associated with the traditional imagined contact hypothesis paradigm. Specifically they found that by guiding Non-Muslim undergraduates to imagine contextual factors within the imagined interaction such as ''when'' and ''where'' the interaction took place improved future intentions to interact with Muslims over and above traditional instructions. Additional research also indicated elaboration increases participants estimated likelihood of befriending elderly individuals.<ref name=\"Husnu & Crisp, 2011\">{{cite journal | last1 = Husnu | first1 = S. | last2 = Crisp | first2 = R.

Stathi, Crisp, & Hogg had participants imagine either a stereotypical or non-stereotypical individual. Specifically they asked participants to either \"imagine meeting a British Muslim stranger for the first time...[who] dresses in a traditional way, avoids alcohol, reads the Koran, and prays five times a day\" or \"imagine meeting a British Muslim stranger...[who] dresses in \"western\" clothes, drinks alcohol, eats pork, and does not pray regularly\".<ref name=\"Stathi, Crisp, & Hogg (2011)\">. Imagining intergroup contact enables member-to-group generalization. ''Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice, 15'' 275-284. p.280</ref> Their results indicated that imagining a [[stereotypical]] individual lead to greater feelings of contact-efficacy, that is how well a future interaction will go. This finding aligns with research on intergroup relations which shows that typicality of members leads to greater generalization effects compared to atypical group members.<ref name=\"Hewstone & Brown, 1986\">Hewstone, M. & Brown, R. (1986). Contact is not enough: An intergroup perspective on the 'contact hypothesis'. In M. Hewstone & R. Brown (Eds.), ''Contact and conflict in intergroup encounters'' (p. 1-44). Oxford, England: Blackwell</ref>\n\n===Individual differences===\nThere are many individual level differences that also moderate the effectiveness of imagined contact. For instance, Husnu and Crisp asked participants the extent to which they have contact with British Muslims and found greater real-life contact was associated with higher intentions to engage with Muslims following an imagined contact paradigm.<ref name=\"Husnu, 2010\" /> Individuals who feel greater [[intergroup anxiety]] also report more difficulty in imaging a positive social interaction with an outgroup member, however, this did not ultimately affect the quality of an interaction with an outgroup member following the imagined contact manipulation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Birtel|first1=M.

Despite early contributions that were later scrapped, it marked the departure of mainstay Deftones producer [[Terry Date]]. It was also their last released album to feature bassist [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] before [[Chi Cheng (musician)#Automobile crash and coma|his car accident]] in 2008, which led to his death five years later.\n\n''Saturday Night Wrist'' was the product of an arduous and stressful creative process lasting roughly two years and straining relationships within the band. Complicating matters and inspiring many of its songs were frontman [[Chino Moreno]]'s drug addictions and the crumbling of his marriage. The final result was an album met with critical praise.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Early writing and recording===\nIn early 2004, Maverick Records told Deftones they needed to head into the studio due to the lackluster sales of the band's [[Deftones (album)|self-titled effort]]. They began pioneering ideas for a new album at their studio, The Spot, in [[Sacramento, California]]. On April 30, 2004, they announced they would be relocating to [[Malibu, California]], to continue writing the album at Morning View House, famous for being the place that [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] recorded their fourth album, ''[[Morning View]]''. Deftones spent most of the summer there, resulting in an album's worth of material that Moreno described as \"straight evil music\".\n\nThey then began searching for a producer and started recording. They initially considered enlisting [[Ken Andrews]] of [[Failure (band)|Failure]] and [[Ric Ocasek]] of [[the Cars]], but to no avail. They then worked with [[Dan the Automator]] for about a week. According to guitarist [[Stephen Carpenter]], during collaboration with Dan, Deftones seemed to be pursuing the \"more technical\", [[mathcore|math metal]]-based elements of the band's sound. After some deliberation, however, Moreno and drummer [[Abe Cunningham]] successfully pushed for working with producer [[Bob Ezrin]] ([[Pink Floyd]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]) and engineer Brian Virtue.\n\nDeftones then took a short break before planning a month-long tour with [[Dredg]] and C-Minus to road-test some material starting in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], and ending in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], near where Ezrin's studio was located. Recording of the album began in November 2004. During the sessions, tensions mounted within the band and between singer Moreno and producer Ezrin. Moreno eventually jumped ship to continue work on his side project [[Team Sleep]] while the rest of the band continued recording. The Ezrin sessions concluded before [[Christmas]] and the band relocated back to their home base in [[Sacramento]] to take a break.\n\nIn early 2005, Deftones started tweaking the Ezrin material with Virtue at their studio The Spot, writing several new songs in the process. Moreno decided to take a break from recording in the spring to tour with Team Sleep, who were also releasing their long-awaited debut album. Moreno claimed that this was good for him, as he was somewhat unable to focus on the recording sessions due to his [[amphetamine|speed]] and alcohol addictions, as well as the dissolution of his longtime marriage to wife Celeste.\n\n===Hiatus===\nThe rest of the band, while anxious to finish the album, decided it would be best to take a break from music. During the hiatus, Deftones released a 10-year anniversary CD/DVD, titled ''[[B-Sides & Rarities (Deftones album)|B-Sides & Rarities]]'', on October 4, 2005. It included one of the songs from the Virtue sessions, a [[Cover version|cover]] of \"Wax and Wane\" by [[Cocteau Twins]]. In late 2005, Moreno met with Date to help record vocals for some of the remaining tracks. The band also managed to quickly record a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s \"[[Jealous Guy]]\" for [[Amnesty International]] as well as an [[iTunes]] exclusive cover of the Cars' \"[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]\".\n\n===Continuation on production===\nIn early 2006, all previously recorded vocals were scrapped and the band started working on the album again with longtime friend [[Shaun Lopez]] (of [[Far (band)|Far]] and [[the Revolution Smile]]) acting as producer. The album was edited by Ryan Gorman. Finally, with all recording finished in April 2006, the album was mixed by Ryan Williams.\n\nThe album featured musical contributions from [[Annie Hardy]] of [[Giant Drag]] and [[Serj Tankian]] of [[System of a Down]]; the latter also contributed to the writing of one song, \"[[Mein (song)|Mein]]\".\n\nCarpenter stated in interviews that a significant portion of the songs were based on ideas by Moreno and that \"Pink Cellphone\", minus Hardy's vocals, was \"all Chino\". In fact, Moreno plays second guitar on many of the songs, including \"[[Hole in the Earth]]\", \"Beware\", \"Cherry Waves\", \"U,U,D,D,L,R,L,R,A,B,Select,Start\", \"Xerces\" and \"Rivi\u00e8re\". However, Moreno stated that \"Rats!Rats!Rats!\" was \"all Stephen\". Carpenter wrote and recorded all guitar parts on \"Rapture\", \"Rats!Rats!Rats!\" and \"Kimdracula\", but also played guitar and wrote guitar parts for all songs except \"U,U,D,D,L,R,L,R,A,B,Select,Start\", where he played drums and Moreno played guitar. The title for the latter song was a reference to the [[Konami Code]], a famous [[video game]] [[cheat code]].\n\nThe writing and recording process of ''Saturday Night Wrist'' was fraught and placed strain on the relationships within the band. Moreno stated that making it was \"a seriously unhealthy experience\", and that it \"dragged on without much direction\". Following its creation, after leaving to work on Team Sleep, he stated that he \"wasn't sure if [he] was going to return\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Albums for 2008: Deftones | journal = [[Kerrang!]] | issue = 1191 | date = January 5, 2008 | page = 47}}</ref>\n\n==Lyrical themes==\nMoreno described the lyrical subject matter of some of the songs in later interviews. He explained that \"Kimdracula\" was part of his email address at the beginning of making the record, during his heavy drug-use phase. \"Beware\" was a warning to others about sex, drugs and drinking, which were the three main problems he encountered during the album's creation. A story about a witch that Moreno wrote during his drug phase was told in \"Rivi\u00e8re\". \"Cherry Waves\" was about testing the trust a person has in someone else. The confusion Moreno experienced when making ''Saturday Night Wrist'' was illustrated in the song \"Rapture\". Communication issues between the divided band, during the making of the album, were captured in \"Hole in the Earth\".\n\nMoreno explained the record's title as being a reference to the [[Radial neuropathy|nerve damage]] caused when an intoxicated person falls asleep on his or her arm. He elaborated on the title, referencing \"when you're alone on Saturday nights and your only best friend is your shaking wrist\".<ref>Snelling N, \"Deftones\" ''Beat Magazine'' (Australia) Issue 1051, February 14, 2007 at p.28.</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Saturday Night Wrist'' was released on October 31, 2006. It was leaked on the Internet on October 13, over two weeks prior to its release. [[Lead single]] \"Hole in the Earth\" was sent to radio on October 16.\n\nA collection of 16 demos from the Ezrin sessions later became available online, containing rough vocal mixes of \"Cherry Waves\" and \"Combat\", an instrumental version of what would become \"Finger of Death\", and several instrumentals recorded by the band without Moreno that did not make the final cut.\n\nThe [[iTunes]] version included the cover of \"Drive\" by the Cars, which featured producer Lopez as well as a prominent sample of [[Massive Attack]]'s track \"[[Protection (Massive Attack song)|Protection]]\" (from their [[Protection (Massive Attack album)|album of the same name]]).\n{{Album ratings\n| MC         = 72/100<ref name=\"Meta\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/saturday-night-wrist/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Saturday Night Wrist |website=Metacritic |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref>\n| rev1       = ''[[The A.V.

Club]]'' gave it a positive review, stating: \"The album is mostly a heady, atmospheric, willfully too-difficult-for-radio wash of sound that, save for a handful of tracks, stretches out and explores Deftones' creative limits more than ever before\".<ref name=\"avclub\"/> Similarly, Adrien Begrand of ''[[PopMatters]]'' concluded: \"For the most part, Saturday Night Wrist has the Deftones improving on all fronts, whether it's Moreno's stirring vocal work or the band's improved versatility [...] The process might have been painstaking, but it appears that after all that work, the band is closer to a {{Sic|?|hide=y|fully|-}}realized sound than ever before.\"\n\nAnother positive review came from [[AllMusic]], which said that \"these songs, as diverse as they are, are utterly disciplined sonically. They have all the tension and dynamic, all the immediacy of yore, but the mix is spacious, and Chino Moreno's vocals soar above it\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> A less enthusiastic, although positive, review came from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s Christian Hoard, who compared the band's \"[[space rock|space-rock]] overlays\" with [[Radiohead]], but pointed out that \"The songwriting never quite comes

[[Deftones]], released on October 31, 2006 by [[Maverick Records]]. Despite early contributions that were later scrapped, it marked the departure of mainstay Deftones producer [[Terry Date]]. It was also their last released album to feature bassist [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] before [[Chi Cheng (musician)#Automobile crash and coma|his car accident]] in 2008, which led to his death five years later.\n\n''Saturday Night Wrist'' was the product of an arduous and stressful creative process lasting roughly two years and straining relationships within the band. Complicating matters and inspiring many of its songs were frontman [[Chino Moreno]]'s drug addictions and the crumbling of his marriage. The final result was an album met with critical praise.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Early writing and recording===\nIn early 2004, Maverick Records told Deftones they needed to head into the studio due to the lackluster sales of the band's [[Deftones (album)|self-titled effort]]. They began pioneering ideas for a new album at their studio, The Spot, in [[Sacramento, California]]. On April 30, 2004, they announced they would be relocating to [[Malibu, California]], to continue writing the album at Morning View House, famous for being the place that [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] recorded their fourth album, ''[[Morning View]]''. Deftones spent most of the summer there, resulting in an album's worth of material that Moreno described as \"straight evil music\".\n\nThey then began searching for a producer and started recording. They initially considered enlisting [[Ken Andrews]] of [[Failure (band)|Failure]] and [[Ric Ocasek]] of [[the Cars]], but to no avail. They then worked with [[Dan the Automator]] for about a week. According to guitarist [[Stephen Carpenter]], during collaboration with Dan, Deftones seemed to be pursuing the \"more technical\", [[mathcore|math metal]]-based elements of the band's sound. After some deliberation, however, Moreno and drummer [[Abe Cunningham]] successfully pushed for working with producer [[Bob Ezrin]] ([[Pink Floyd]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]) and engineer Brian Virtue.\n\nDeftones then took a short break before planning a month-long tour with [[Dredg]] and C-Minus to road-test some material starting in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], and ending in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], near where Ezrin's studio was located. Recording of the album began in November 2004. During the sessions, tensions mounted within the band and between singer Moreno and producer Ezrin. Moreno eventually jumped ship to continue work on his side project [[Team Sleep]] while the rest of the band continued recording. The Ezrin sessions concluded before [[Christmas]] and the band relocated back to their home base in [[Sacramento]] to take a break.\n\nIn early 2005, Deftones started tweaking the Ezrin material with Virtue at their studio The Spot, writing several new songs in the process. Moreno decided to take a break from recording in the spring to tour with Team Sleep, who were also releasing their long-awaited debut album. Moreno claimed that this was good for him, as he was somewhat unable to focus on the recording sessions due to his [[amphetamine|speed]] and alcohol addictions, as well as the dissolution of his longtime marriage to wife Celeste.\n\n===Hiatus===\nThe rest of the band, while anxious to finish the album, decided it would be best to take a break from music. During the hiatus, Deftones released a 10-year anniversary CD/DVD, titled ''[[B-Sides & Rarities (Deftones album)|B-Sides & Rarities]]'', on October 4, 2005. It included one of the songs from the Virtue sessions, a [[Cover version|cover]] of \"Wax and Wane\" by [[Cocteau Twins]]. In late 2005, Moreno met with Date to help record vocals for some of the remaining tracks. The band also managed to quickly record a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s \"[[Jealous Guy]]\" for [[Amnesty International]] as well as an [[iTunes]] exclusive cover of the Cars' \"[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]\".\n\n===Continuation on production===\nIn early 2006, all previously recorded vocals were scrapped and the band started working on the album again with longtime friend [[Shaun Lopez]] (of [[Far (band)|Far]] and [[the Revolution Smile]]) acting as producer. The album was edited by Ryan Gorman. Finally, with all recording finished in April 2006, the album was mixed by Ryan Williams.\n\nThe album featured musical contributions from [[Annie Hardy]] of [[Giant Drag]] and [[Serj Tankian]] of [[System of a Down]]; the latter also contributed to the writing of one song, \"[[Mein (song)|Mein]]\".\n\nCarpenter stated in interviews that a significant portion of the songs were based on ideas by Moreno and that \"Pink Cellphone\", minus Hardy's vocals, was \"all Chino\". In fact, Moreno plays second guitar on many of the songs, including \"[[Hole in the Earth]]\", \"Beware\", \"Cherry Waves\", \"U,U,D,D,L,R,L,R,A,B,Select,Start\", \"Xerces\" and \"Rivi\u00e8re\". However, Moreno stated that \"Rats!Rats!Rats!\" was \"all Stephen\". Carpenter wrote and recorded all guitar parts on \"Rapture\", \"Rats!Rats!Rats!\" and \"Kimdracula\", but also played guitar and wrote guitar parts for all songs except \"U,U,D,D,L,R,L,R,A,B,Select,Start\", where he played drums and Moreno played guitar. The title for the latter song was a reference to the [[Konami Code]], a famous [[video game]] [[cheat code]].\n\nThe writing and recording process of ''Saturday Night Wrist'' was fraught and placed strain on the relationships within the band. Moreno stated that making it was \"a seriously unhealthy experience\", and that it \"dragged on without much direction\". Following its creation, after leaving to work on Team Sleep, he stated that he \"wasn't sure if [he] was going to return\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Albums for 2008: Deftones | journal = [[Kerrang!]] | issue = 1191 | date = January 5, 2008 | page = 47}}</ref>\n\n==Lyrical themes==\nMoreno described the lyrical subject matter of some of the songs in later interviews. He explained that \"Kimdracula\" was part of his email address at the beginning of making the record, during his heavy drug-use phase. \"Beware\" was a warning to others about sex, drugs and drinking, which were the three main problems he encountered during the album's creation. A story about a witch that Moreno wrote during his drug phase was told in \"Rivi\u00e8re\". \"Cherry Waves\" was about testing the trust a person has in someone else. The confusion Moreno experienced when making ''Saturday Night Wrist'' was illustrated in the song \"Rapture\". Communication issues between the divided band, during the making of the album, were captured in \"Hole in the Earth\".\n\nMoreno explained the record's title as being a reference to the [[Radial neuropathy|nerve damage]] caused when an intoxicated person falls asleep on his or her arm. He elaborated on the title, referencing \"when you're alone on Saturday nights and your only best friend is your shaking wrist\".<ref>Snelling N, \"Deftones\" ''Beat Magazine'' (Australia) Issue 1051, February 14, 2007 at p.28.</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Saturday Night Wrist'' was released on October 31, 2006. It was leaked on the Internet on October 13, over two weeks prior to its release. [[Lead single]] \"Hole in the Earth\" was sent to radio on October 16.\n\nA collection of 16 demos from the Ezrin sessions later became available online, containing rough vocal mixes of \"Cherry Waves\" and \"Combat\", an instrumental version of what would become \"Finger of Death\", and several instrumentals recorded by the band without Moreno that did not make the final cut.\n\nThe [[iTunes]] version included the cover of \"Drive\" by the Cars, which featured producer Lopez as well as a prominent sample of [[Massive Attack]]'s track \"[[Protection (Massive Attack song)|Protection]]\" (from their [[Protection (Massive Attack album)|album of the same name]]).\n{{Album ratings\n| MC         = 72/100<ref name=\"Meta\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/saturday-night-wrist/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Saturday Night Wrist |website=Metacritic |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref>\n| rev1       = ''[[The A.V.

Club]]'' gave it a positive review, stating: \"The album is mostly a heady, atmospheric, willfully too-difficult-for-radio wash of sound that, save for a handful of tracks, stretches out and explores Deftones' creative limits more than ever before\".<ref name=\"avclub\"/> Similarly, Adrien Begrand of ''[[PopMatters]]'' concluded: \"For the most part, Saturday Night Wrist has the Deftones improving on all fronts, whether it's Moreno's stirring vocal work or the band's improved versatility [...] The process might have been painstaking, but it appears that after all that work, the band is closer to a {{Sic|?|hide=y|fully|-}}realized sound than ever before.\"\n\nAnother positive review came from [[AllMusic]], which said that \"these songs, as diverse as they are, are utterly disciplined sonically. They have all the tension and dynamic, all the immediacy of yore, but the mix is spacious, and Chino Moreno's vocals soar above it\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> A less enthusiastic, although positive, review came from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s Christian Hoard, who compared the band's \"[[space rock|space-rock]] overlays\" with [[Radiohead]], but pointed out that \"The songwriting never quite comes
