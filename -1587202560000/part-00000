The translators were Hungarian Calvinist priests from [[Transylvania]]. The first complete translation to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] was made in 1688 (called \"[[Biblia de la Bucure\u015fti]]\"). The Old Testament was translated by Moldavian-born [[Nicolae Milescu]] in Constantinople. The translator used as his source a [[Septuagint]] published in Frankfurt in 1597. The manuscript was afterwards revised in Moldova and later brought to Bucharest, where it was again subject to revision by a team of Wallachian scholars (among whom were Radu and \u015eerban Greceanu) with the help of [[\u015eerban Cantacuzino]] and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]].\n\nBefore the publication of the Bucharest Bible, other partial translations were published, such as the Slavic-Romanian Gospel (1551), [[Coresi]]'s Gospel (1561), The Bra\u015fov Psalm Book (1570), Palia from Or\u0103\u015ftie (1582), The New Testament of Alba Iulia (1648) and others.

They inhabit mostly [[Mallee (habit)|mallee]] woodland that has relatively dense shrub and [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] understorey. Shy heathwrens feed mostly on ground dwelling insects; rarely on seeds. Their ground level nests are dome-shaped and usually concealed within grass [[Bunch grass|tussocks]] or shrubs.<ref name=\"NSWsite\">{{cite web|url=http://www.threatenedspecies.environment.nsw.gov.au/tsprofile/profile.aspx?id=10125|title=Shy Heathwren \u2013 Profile|publisher=Department of Environment and Climate Change, NSW|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> Within the nest they typically lay 2\u20133 freckled and pinkish eggs.<ref name=\"Slater\">{{cite book|last=Slater|first=Peter|author2=Slater, Pat |author3=Slater, Raoul |title=[[The Slater Field Guide to Australian Birds]]|publisher=Landsdowne|location=Sydney|year=1993|edition=Revised|pages=258|isbn=0-947116-99-0}}</ref>\n\nThe birds are cock-tailed with a chestnut rump that darkens towards the tip. Their feathers are white with brown streaking underneath and greyish-brown on the back and crown. They have a white eyebrow, tail tip and patch on the [[flight feather]]s, and a black [[Beak|bill]]. Their eyes are brown to yellowish-brown and legs are slate-brown. Females have slightly duller colouring, and immature birds duller again with some of these being fawn-coloured underneath.<ref name=\"Slater\" /><ref name=\"NSWsite\" /> They have a total length when adults from 11 to 14 centimetres.<ref>listed as 12\u201314 cm in Slater P.(1993) but 11\u201314 cm by the Department of Environment and Climate Change, NSW</ref>\n\nThey are uncommon residents across a wide part of southern Australia. Ranging from near [[West Wyalong, New South Wales|West Wyalong]] in [[New South Wales]] to the [[Murchison River (Western Australia)|Murchison River]] in [[Western Australia]].<ref name=\"Slater\" /> In New South Wales, they are found in two isolated populations: one between [[Leeton, New South Wales|Leeton]], Willandra, [[New South Wales]], [[Nymagee, New South Wales|Nymagee]] and West Wyalong; and the other from [[Balranald, New South Wales|Balranald]] to [[Trentham Cliffs, New South Wales|Trentham Cliffs]]. Within the state they are seen as a [[threatened]] and [[vulnerable]] species, largely due to human-wrought [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]], and [[predation]] by foxes and cats.<ref name=\"NSWsite\" />\n\nTheir [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] name was formerly ''Calamanthus cautus''\u2014classing them as fieldwrens\u2014until they were renamed in 2008.<ref>{{cite book|last=Christidis|first=L|author2=Boles, W.E |title=Systematics and Taxonomy of Australian Birds|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria|year=2008|isbn=978-0-643-06511-6}}</ref> The generic name ''Hylacola'' derives from the Greek ''hyl\u0113'' 'woodland' and the latin ''-cola'' 'dweller'.<ref name=Helm>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling|title=Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird-names|last=Jobling|first=James A.|accessdate = 2020-04-18}}</ref> The specific epithet derives from the Latin ''cautus'' 'shy, wary'.<ref name=Helm></ref> Common names for the species include shy hylacola<ref name=\"iucnredlist\" /> and mallee heathwren.<ref>Pizzey, Graham; Doyle, Roy (1980) ''A Field Guide to the Birds of Australia''.
