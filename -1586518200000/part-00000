According to the rituals involved, this was the first Brahmo wedding. Ramakrishna Gobal Bhandhakar, a Brahmo leader and social reformer at that time, conducted the wedding at the Madras Brahmo Samaj. Several Brahmo leaders presided over the wedding. Kallat Kausallyaammal was a supporter of Gopalan and assisted his social reform activities.\n\nGopalan worked as a doctor, chief surgeon, and [[Chief physician|superintendent]] at several hospitals in [[South India]], including in [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]], [[Tiruchirappalli|Tiruchirapalli]], [[Madurai]], [[Chennai]], [[Mysore]], and [[Bangalore]] ([[Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospitals]]).

A Brahmomandir was also constructed in 1928 at: Poonthoppu, Kommady, Alappuzha (now Grihalakshmi Gandhi Smaraka Seva Sangam) with the donation by a [[landlord]] ([[Jenmi]]) of Alleppey, named Mangalath Cochoumini Channar. Channar was once a strict follower of [[Narayana Guru|Sree Narayana Guru]], but was later influenced by the reform activities of Gopalan and Brahmo Samaj. His daughter, Mangalath Cochoumini Mandhakinibai, spearheaded the reform activities at Alappuzha Brahmosamaj and was married to Gopalan's third son, Devadath Ayathan. This was the first Brahmo wedding conducted at Alappuzha Brahmo Samaj, which ignited the custom of Misra Vivaham all over South Kerala.\n\n== Social reform activities ==\nIn the year 1900, Gopalan along with his wife Kallat Kausallyaammal initiated the [[Sugunavardhini Movement]] and extended his social reform activities. Through this movement, he worked to foster human values in children,attract children to do social activities, protect the rights of women, and provide free education to girls and marginalized sections of society, especially the [[Harijan]] communities in Kerala, that were then ill-treated by the higher castes, such as the [[Brahmin]]s and the [[Nair]]s. He established the Lady Chandhawarkar Elementary School intends to educate girls and the underprivileged section of society. Weekly meetings were conducted at his home, Santhi Ashram. Women, children, and people from all walks of life gathered there to share their sorrows with Gopalan and Kausallyaammal, who worked to address them. After the sad demise of Kallat Kausallyaammal, her daughter-in-law M.C. Mandhakinibai Devadath, took over the baton to unite women and the lower sections of the community to help them assert their social rights. It was Mandakinibai Devadath who first proposed The concept of \"women's organization\".\n\n[[Narayana Guru|Sree Narayana Guru]] arrived in Malabar during the time when Ayyathan Gopalan was going through a period of vigorous campaigns among the lower sections of Malabar for the upliftment of the underprivileged people and social reforms. After seeing the reform activities of Gopalan, he said,\"Everything's done here, I have nothing new to do\". Gopalan, though averse to idolatry and temple building, did not join with Guru. Sensing the social relevance of the [[Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam|Sree Narayana movement]], Ayyathan did not oppose it either. Gopalan realized that social reform was his way of life and did not take part in the national movement or agitations.Unlike the [[Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam|Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP)]], which had been established by Narayana Guru<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sreenarayanaguru.in/|title=narayana guru|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Narayana Guru; \u1e62\u0101j\u012b, K.

He also served as a magistrate during the [[British rule]] in Malabar.\n\nGopalan married Kallat Kausallyaammal on 30&nbsp;December 1894. According to the rituals involved, this was the first Brahmo wedding. Ramakrishna Gobal Bhandhakar, a Brahmo leader and social reformer at that time, conducted the wedding at the Madras Brahmo Samaj. Several Brahmo leaders presided over the wedding. Kallat Kausallyaammal was a supporter of Gopalan and assisted his social reform activities.\n\nGopalan worked as a doctor, chief surgeon, and [[Chief physician|superintendent]] at several hospitals in [[South India]], including in [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]], [[Tiruchirappalli|Tiruchirapalli]], [[Madurai]], [[Chennai]], [[Mysore]], and [[Bangalore]] ([[Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospitals]]). He returned to Kerala in 1896 and joined [[Kuthiravattam Mental Hospital|Calicut Lunatic asylum]] (now the Kuthiravattom Mental Hospital) as its first superintendent. Meanwhile, [[caste]] and [[racial discrimination]], evil practices, beliefs, and social injustices were prevalent in Kerala, and atrocities against women and children were at their peak.

A Brahmomandir was also constructed in 1928 at: Poonthoppu, Kommady, Alappuzha (now Grihalakshmi Gandhi Smaraka Seva Sangam) with the donation by a [[landlord]] ([[Jenmi]]) of Alleppey, named Mangalath Cochoumini Channar. Channar was once a strict follower of [[Narayana Guru|Sree Narayana Guru]], but was later influenced by the reform activities of Gopalan and Brahmo Samaj. His daughter, Mangalath Cochoumini Mandhakinibai, spearheaded the reform activities at Alappuzha Brahmosamaj and was married to Gopalan's third son, Devadath Ayathan. This was the first Brahmo wedding conducted at Alappuzha Brahmo Samaj, which ignited the custom of Misra Vivaham all over South Kerala.\n\n== Social reform activities ==\nIn the year 1900, Gopalan along with his wife Kallat Kausallyaammal initiated the [[Sugunavardhini Movement]] and extended his social reform activities. Through this movement, he worked to foster human values in children,attract children to do social activities, protect the rights of women, and provide free education to girls and marginalized sections of society, especially the [[Harijan]] communities in Kerala, that were then ill-treated by the higher castes, such as the [[Brahmin]]s and the [[Nair]]s. He established the Lady Chandhawarkar Elementary School intends to educate girls and the underprivileged section of society. Weekly meetings were conducted at his home, Santhi Ashram. Women, children, and people from all walks of life gathered there to share their sorrows with Gopalan and Kausallyaammal, who worked to address them. After the sad demise of Kallat Kausallyaammal, her daughter-in-law M.C. Mandhakinibai Devadath, took over the baton to unite women and the lower sections of the community to help them assert their social rights. It was Mandakinibai Devadath who first proposed The concept of \"women's organization\".\n\n[[Narayana Guru|Sree Narayana Guru]] arrived in Malabar during the time when Ayyathan Gopalan was going through a period of vigorous campaigns among the lower sections of Malabar for the upliftment of the underprivileged people and social reforms. After seeing the reform activities of Gopalan, he said,\"Everything's done here, I have nothing new to do\". Gopalan, though averse to idolatry and temple building, did not join with Guru. Sensing the social relevance of the [[Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam|Sree Narayana movement]], Ayyathan did not oppose it either. Gopalan realized that social reform was his way of life and did not take part in the national movement or agitations.Unlike the [[Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam|Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP)]], which had been established by Narayana Guru<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sreenarayanaguru.in/|title=narayana guru|website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Narayana Guru; \u1e62\u0101j\u012b, K.

It follows students at an elite secondary school and their friends. The series stars [[Mar\u00eda Pedraza]], [[Itzan Escamilla]], [[Miguel Bernardeau]], [[Miguel Herr\u00e1n]], [[Jaime Lorente]], [[\u00c1lvaro Rico]], [[Ar\u00f3n Piper]], [[Mina El Hammani]], [[Ester Exp\u00f3sito]], Omar Ayuso, and [[Danna Paola]]. [[Jorge L\u00f3pez (actor)|Jorge L\u00f3pez]], Claudia Salas and [[Georgina Amor\u00f3s]] joined in season 2, and Sergio Momo and Le\u00efti S\u00e8ne, in season 3. Many of the cast previously featured in other Netflix works produced or distributed through its Spain and Latin America body.\n\n''Elite'' explores concepts associated with teen dramas, but also features more progressive issues and other sides to its [[clich\u00e9]]s. These include many diverse sexual themes. Structurally, the series employs a flash-forward plot.\n\n==Premise==\n{{improve|reason=This section could be made into a plot section, rather than the vague premise from pre-release sources|date=April 2020}}\n===Season 1===\nAfter their school collapses, three [[working class]] friends\u2014Samuel ([[Itzan Escamilla]]), Nadia ([[Mina El Hammani]]) and Christian ([[Miguel Herr\u00e1n]])\u2014are given scholarships to Las Encinas, the most exclusive private school in Spain, where the [[elite]] send their kids to study. The scholarships are sponsored by the construction company at fault for the collapse.\n\nAt Las Encinas, the three are initially ostracized by the wealthy students. However, Samuel soon befriends the rebellious Marina ([[Mar\u00eda Pedraza]]), whose corrupt father controls the construction company. At the same time, Nadia becomes close to Marina's charismatic but arrogant brother, Guzm\u00e1n ([[Miguel Bernardeau]]). Guzm\u00e1n's girlfriend, Lu ([[Danna Paola]]), dares him to take Nadia's virginity. Meanwhile, Christian becomes involved in a polyamorous relationship with aristocratic couple Polo ([[\u00c1lvaro Rico]]) and Carla ([[Ester Exp\u00f3sito]]).\n\nOutside Las Encinas, Nadia's [[coming out|closeted]] brother Omar (Omar Ayuso) secretly sells drugs to make enough money to get away from his conservative parents. He soon befriends the son of Las Encinas' principal, Ander (Ar\u00f3n Piper), who is also Guzm\u00e1n and Polo's best friend. Omar and Ander begin a secret relationship. Marina and Samuel begin to date but she also begins an affair with Nano ([[Jaime Lorente]]), Samuel's elder brother who is fresh out of prison and has debts to pay.\n\nAs the school year progresses, their lives intertwine in a clash of lifestyles, resentments, envy, and sexual attraction.\n\nThrough a series of flash-forward scenes of police interrogations, the audience is shown stories of the character's relationships that somehow lead to a murder.\n\n===Season 2===\nAfter the revelation of the murder, the second season deals with these relationships and flash forward scenes are shown to find out about the disappearance of a student and how it is linked to the plot of getting the murderer to pay their price.\n\nChristian's guilty conscience overtakes him as he seeks to confess to the police the circumstances of Marina's death. However, on his way to the police, he is involved in a motorcycle accident where Carla's father pays for his medical treatment to be taken place in Switzerland, eliminating him as a possible witness to the murder.\n\nThree new students Valerio ([[Jorge L\u00f3pez (actor)|Jorge L\u00f3pez]]), Rebeka (Claudia Salas), and Cayetana ([[Georgina Amor\u00f3s]]) join the school where each of them have their own dark secrets. They befriend the students in their class where Rebeka forms a close bond with Samuel, Nadia and Omar, while Valerio tries to break up Lu and Guzman, and Cayetana befriends Lu while expressing a romantic interest in Polo. \n\nNadia takes her relationship to the next level with Guzman, where she struggles with her values while staying true to her feelings. Guzman starts taking drugs under the influence of Valerio in order to numb the pain over Marina's death. Omar gets kicked out of his home where he seeks shelter with Ander who is keeping a dark secret of a friend's. Carla and Samuel get involved, however Samuel has an ulterior motive as he suspects Carla to be involved in Marina's death. Nano is imprisoned as he does not have the money to post bail, causing Samuel to partake in illegal activities for Rebeka's mother.

(genre)|thriller]] [[teen drama]] [[web television]] series created for [[Netflix]] by Carlos Montero and Dar\u00edo Madrona. It follows students at an elite secondary school and their friends. The series stars [[Mar\u00eda Pedraza]], [[Itzan Escamilla]], [[Miguel Bernardeau]], [[Miguel Herr\u00e1n]], [[Jaime Lorente]], [[\u00c1lvaro Rico]], [[Ar\u00f3n Piper]], [[Mina El Hammani]], [[Ester Exp\u00f3sito]], Omar Ayuso, and [[Danna Paola]]. [[Jorge L\u00f3pez (actor)|Jorge L\u00f3pez]], Claudia Salas and [[Georgina Amor\u00f3s]] joined in season 2, and Sergio Momo and Le\u00efti S\u00e8ne, in season 3. Many of the cast previously featured in other Netflix works produced or distributed through its Spain and Latin America body.\n\n''Elite'' explores concepts associated with teen dramas, but also features more progressive issues and other sides to its [[clich\u00e9]]s. These include many diverse sexual themes. Structurally, the series employs a flash-forward plot.\n\n==Premise==\n{{improve|reason=This section could be made into a plot section, rather than the vague premise from pre-release sources|date=April 2020}}\n===Season 1===\nAfter their school collapses, three [[working class]] friends\u2014Samuel ([[Itzan Escamilla]]), Nadia ([[Mina El Hammani]]) and Christian ([[Miguel Herr\u00e1n]])\u2014are given scholarships to Las Encinas, the most exclusive private school in Spain, where the [[elite]] send their kids to study. The scholarships are sponsored by the construction company at fault for the collapse.\n\nAt Las Encinas, the three are initially ostracized by the wealthy students. However, Samuel soon befriends the rebellious Marina ([[Mar\u00eda Pedraza]]), whose corrupt father controls the construction company. At the same time, Nadia becomes close to Marina's charismatic but arrogant brother, Guzm\u00e1n ([[Miguel Bernardeau]]). Guzm\u00e1n's girlfriend, Lu ([[Danna Paola]]), dares him to take Nadia's virginity. Meanwhile, Christian becomes involved in a polyamorous relationship with aristocratic couple Polo ([[\u00c1lvaro Rico]]) and Carla ([[Ester Exp\u00f3sito]]).\n\nOutside Las Encinas, Nadia's [[coming out|closeted]] brother Omar (Omar Ayuso) secretly sells drugs to make enough money to get away from his conservative parents. He soon befriends the son of Las Encinas' principal, Ander (Ar\u00f3n Piper), who is also Guzm\u00e1n and Polo's best friend. Omar and Ander begin a secret relationship. Marina and Samuel begin to date but she also begins an affair with Nano ([[Jaime Lorente]]), Samuel's elder brother who is fresh out of prison and has debts to pay.\n\nAs the school year progresses, their lives intertwine in a clash of lifestyles, resentments, envy, and sexual attraction.\n\nThrough a series of flash-forward scenes of police interrogations, the audience is shown stories of the character's relationships that somehow lead to a murder.\n\n===Season 2===\nAfter the revelation of the murder, the second season deals with these relationships and flash forward scenes are shown to find out about the disappearance of a student and how it is linked to the plot of getting the murderer to pay their price.\n\nChristian's guilty conscience overtakes him as he seeks to confess to the police the circumstances of Marina's death. However, on his way to the police, he is involved in a motorcycle accident where Carla's father pays for his medical treatment to be taken place in Switzerland, eliminating him as a possible witness to the murder.\n\nThree new students Valerio ([[Jorge L\u00f3pez (actor)|Jorge L\u00f3pez]]), Rebeka (Claudia Salas), and Cayetana ([[Georgina Amor\u00f3s]]) join the school where each of them have their own dark secrets. They befriend the students in their class where Rebeka forms a close bond with Samuel, Nadia and Omar, while Valerio tries to break up Lu and Guzman, and Cayetana befriends Lu while expressing a romantic interest in Polo. \n\nNadia takes her relationship to the next level with Guzman, where she struggles with her values while staying true to her feelings. Guzman starts taking drugs under the influence of Valerio in order to numb the pain over Marina's death. Omar gets kicked out of his home where he seeks shelter with Ander who is keeping a dark secret of a friend's. Carla and Samuel get involved, however Samuel has an ulterior motive as he suspects Carla to be involved in Marina's death. Nano is imprisoned as he does not have the money to post bail, causing Samuel to partake in illegal activities for Rebeka's mother. Polo attempts suicide to clear his conscience, but eventually learns to live happily, while deteriorating Ander's mental health. Lu decides to expose someone's dirty secret. Guzman suspects that Marina was killed by someone in his inner circle. \n\nThe season is shown through flashbacks where each student is interrogated by the inspector concerning the disappearance of Samuel. It is eventually revealed that the disappearance was staged in order to elicit a confession from the murderers concerning Marina's death.\n\n===Season 3===\nWith the shocking revelation and the breaking tension between students in light of the exposed culprit behind Marina's murder, only one question remains.
