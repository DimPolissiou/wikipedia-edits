The single track would contribute to a fatal accident at [[Emu Plains]] in 1878 where eastbound and westbound goods trains collided.<ref name=\"Low\" />\n\nIn 1890 signal boxes were built at both Lower and Upper Points of the Zig Zag, this was to replace the operation of pointsmen using hand levers.<ref name=\"environment.nsw.gov.au\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=1170821|title=G024 : Lapstone Zig Zag {{!}} NSW Environment & Heritage|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\n====The Glenbrook tunnel deviation====\nCommissioner of Railways, E.

The Lapstone ZigZag and [[Lucasville railway station|Lucasville station]] were officially closed on 18 December 1892 and the rails were raised, after the completion of the Glenbrook Tunnel Deviation.<ref name=\"environment.nsw.gov.au\"/> The Deviation soon experienced problems as it was built at the same too steep grade as the Zig Zag which caused the locomotives to slip in the tunnel, mostly due to water leaking onto the tunnel floor from nearby creek, and smoke also became a problem for uphill trains, as the tunnel was not designed to vent the smoke.<ref name=\"Low\" /> \n\nThe building of the tunnel is the subject of [[Arthur Streeton|Arthur Streeton's]] famous painting ''Fire's On''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistsfootsteps.com/html/Streeton_fireson.htm |title=Artist's Footsteps |publisher=Artistsfootsteps.com |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nBy 1910, the line as a whole was being duplicated (made into [[double track]]) and the \"rathole\" tunnel was replaced on a different deviation with a gentler alignment with 1 in 60 (1.67%) grades and the New [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] tunnel at Bluffs point on the Glenbrook Creek escartment. From then on the lower section of the track, including the historic [[Knapsack Viaduct|Knapsack Gully Viaduct]], was converted into a road, the Great Western Highway, the main road up the Lapstone hill until the M4 motorway replaced it in 1993.<ref name=\"knpasack\">{{cite web|author=David Martin - Blue Mountains |url=http://infobluemountains.net.au/rail/lower/lapstone.htm |title=Lapstone Hill Railway Routes- Blue Mountains, Australia |publisher=Infobluemountains.net.au |date=28 February 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> The older tunnel was converted for mushroom growing but was also used by the [[RAAF]] for storage during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|author=Blue Mountains Railway Pages - David Martin |url=http://infobluemountains.net.au/rail/lower/glen-tunnel-old.htm |title=Glenbrook's old Railway Tunnel - Blue Mountains |publisher=Infobluemountains.net.au |date=9 December 1912 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> During 1943 to 1946 Glenbrook tunnel stored chemical weapons [http://www.mustardgas.org/depots.htm]. Today the Zig Zag, Knapsack Viaduct, The Old Glenbook Tunnel and Lucasville station can all be accessed by walking tracks.\n\n=== Knapsack Viaduct 1863-65 ===\nThe Knapsack Viaduct was designed by and built by [[John Whitton]]. Its purpose was to carry the Railway Line across Knapsack Gully. It formed part of the Zig Zag, which climbed the eastern escarpment from Emu Plains to today's Glenbrook. Whitton also designed and built The Victoria Bridge across the Nepean River at Penrith. \n[[File:Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone (2886372648).jpg|thumb|View From Emu Plains, New South Wales]]\nConstruction of the Knapsack Gully Viaduct started in March 1863 by contractor W. Watkins, who also completed the stone piers of the Victoria Bridge at Penrith. Work was completed in 1865, with the bridge being constructed from local sandstone quarried in the neighbourhood around [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]], and carried a single rail line.\n\nThe viaduct fell into disuse in 1913 after the completion of the Glenbrook Gorge Deviation. In 1926, after over a decade of disuse, the Knapsack Viaduct was taken over by the Main Roads Board. The board sort to improve the route of the Great Western Highway between [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]] and [[Blaxland, New South Wales|Blaxland]], that at the time zig zagged up what is today Old Bathurst Road. The viaduct's carriageway was widened to allow for two car lanes, by trimming back the inside face of the stone parapets. The new road was opened by Governor Sir Dudley DeChair on 23 October 1926. The viaduct was again widened in 1939, with the construction of a reinforced concrete cantilevered deck, because of increased traffic use.\n\nThe final deviation of the [[Great Western Highway]], with the opening of the [[M4 Western Motorway|M4]] finally ended traffic flow across the Knapsack Viaduct in 1993. In 1995 the Viaduct was reopened to the public as part of the historic Lapstone Zig Zag walk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4301012|title=Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone {{!}} NSW Environment & Heritage|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nThe line of the old track and cuttings (including the long abandoned platform of Lucasville station), and the old Knapsack Gully bridge is now a popular [[bushwalking]] track.<ref name=\"walks1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/glenbrook-eastern-blue-mountains/lapstone-bridge-zigzig-walk.html |title=Wildwalks |location=AU-NS |publisher=Wildwalks |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> Often a cacophony of [[Bird vocalization|birdsong]] and insects can be heard where the gully is deep at the viaduct and it would tend to echo these sounds, especially that of the [[bell miner]].

M. Eddy, decided that the ZigZag should be replaced by the [[Glenbrook Deviation 1892, New South Wales|deviation]] including a [[Glenbrook Tunnel|tunnel]], both built around 1890. The Lapstone ZigZag and [[Lucasville railway station|Lucasville station]] were officially closed on 18 December 1892 and the rails were raised, after the completion of the Glenbrook Tunnel Deviation.<ref name=\"environment.nsw.gov.au\"/> The Deviation soon experienced problems as it was built at the same too steep grade as the Zig Zag which caused the locomotives to slip in the tunnel, mostly due to water leaking onto the tunnel floor from nearby creek, and smoke also became a problem for uphill trains, as the tunnel was not designed to vent the smoke.<ref name=\"Low\" /> \n\nThe building of the tunnel is the subject of [[Arthur Streeton|Arthur Streeton's]] famous painting ''Fire's On''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistsfootsteps.com/html/Streeton_fireson.htm |title=Artist's Footsteps |publisher=Artistsfootsteps.com |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nBy 1910, the line as a whole was being duplicated (made into [[double track]]) and the \"rathole\" tunnel was replaced on a different deviation with a gentler alignment with 1 in 60 (1.67%) grades and the New [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] tunnel at Bluffs point on the Glenbrook Creek escartment. From then on the lower section of the track, including the historic [[Knapsack Viaduct|Knapsack Gully Viaduct]], was converted into a road, the Great Western Highway, the main road up the Lapstone hill until the M4 motorway replaced it in 1993.<ref name=\"knpasack\">{{cite web|author=David Martin - Blue Mountains |url=http://infobluemountains.net.au/rail/lower/lapstone.htm |title=Lapstone Hill Railway Routes- Blue Mountains, Australia |publisher=Infobluemountains.net.au |date=28 February 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> The older tunnel was converted for mushroom growing but was also used by the [[RAAF]] for storage during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|author=Blue Mountains Railway Pages - David Martin |url=http://infobluemountains.net.au/rail/lower/glen-tunnel-old.htm |title=Glenbrook's old Railway Tunnel - Blue Mountains |publisher=Infobluemountains.net.au |date=9 December 1912 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> During 1943 to 1946 Glenbrook tunnel stored chemical weapons [http://www.mustardgas.org/depots.htm]. Today the Zig Zag, Knapsack Viaduct, The Old Glenbook Tunnel and Lucasville station can all be accessed by walking tracks.\n\n=== Knapsack Viaduct 1863-65 ===\nThe Knapsack Viaduct was designed by and built by [[John Whitton]]. Its purpose was to carry the Railway Line across Knapsack Gully. It formed part of the Zig Zag, which climbed the eastern escarpment from Emu Plains to today's [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]]. Whitton also designed and built The Victoria Bridge across the Nepean River at Penrith. \n[[File:Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone (2886372648).jpg|thumb|View From Emu Plains, New South Wales]]\nConstruction of the Knapsack Gully Viaduct started in March 1863 by contractor W. Watkins, who also completed the stone piers of the Victoria Bridge at Penrith. Work was completed in 1865, with the bridge being constructed from local sandstone quarried in the neighbourhood around [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]], and carried a single rail line.\n\nThe viaduct fell into disuse in 1913 after the completion of the Glenbrook Gorge Deviation. In 1926, after over a decade of disuse, the Knapsack Viaduct was taken over by the Main Roads Board. The board sort to improve the route of the Great Western Highway between [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]] and [[Blaxland, New South Wales|Blaxland]], that at the time zig zagged up what is today Old Bathurst Road. The viaduct's carriageway was widened to allow for two car lanes, by trimming back the inside face of the stone parapets. The new road was opened by Governor Sir Dudley DeChair on 23 October 1926. The viaduct was again widened in 1939, with the construction of a reinforced concrete cantilevered deck, because of increased traffic use.\n\nThe final deviation of the [[Great Western Highway]], with the opening of the [[M4 Western Motorway|M4]] finally ended traffic flow across the Knapsack Viaduct in 1993. In 1995 the Viaduct was reopened to the public as part of the historic Lapstone Zig Zag walk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4301012|title=Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone {{!}} NSW Environment & Heritage|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nThe line of the old track and cuttings (including the long abandoned platform of Lucasville station), and the old Knapsack Gully bridge is now a popular [[bushwalking]] track.<ref name=\"walks1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/glenbrook-eastern-blue-mountains/lapstone-bridge-zigzig-walk.html |title=Wildwalks |location=AU-NS |publisher=Wildwalks |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> Often a cacophony of [[Bird vocalization|birdsong]] and insects can be heard where the gully is deep at the viaduct and it would tend to echo these sounds, especially that of the [[bell miner]].

From 1918 to 1970 the official spelling of the constituency name was '''Llanelly'''. It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election.\n\nThe [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli Welsh Assembly constituency]] was created with the same boundaries in 1999.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1918'''\nThe constituency was established in 1918, as a division of [[Carmarthenshire]], located in the south east of the county. This area had, until 1918, been the southern part of the constituency of [[East Carmarthenshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Carmarthenshire]].\n\nIt consisted of the then local authority areas of the [[Municipal Borough]] of Llanelly; the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]]s of [[Ammanford]], [[Burry Port]] and [[Cwmamman]]; the [[Rural District]]s of Lanelly and part of [[Llandeilo|Llandilofawr]] (namely the civil parishes of [[Betws, Carmarthenshire|Betws]], [[Llandybie]] and [[Quarter Bach]], and Ward I of the civil parish of Llandilo Rural)<ref>[[Representation of the People Act 1918]], Ninth Schedule, Part II, Parliamentary Counties: Wales and Monmouthshire.</ref>\n\nThe division bordered [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]] to the west and north, [[Brecon and Radnor (UK Parliament constituency)|Brecon and Radnor]] to the north east, [[Neath (UK Parliament constituency)|Neath]] to the east, [[Gower (UK Parliament constituency)|Gower]] to the south east and the sea to the south.\n\n'''1950'''\nIn the next redistribution of constituencies in Wales, which took effect in 1950, the northern boundary of the constituency was slightly altered. Llanelly no longer bordered [[Brecon and Radnor (UK Parliament constituency)|Brecon and Radnor]] and Gower was extended north and took over the part of the 1918 Neath constituency that had previously adjoined Carmarthenshire. The constituency area continued to include the same local authorities as in 1918 (apart from a spelling change to [[Llandeilo|Llandilo]] for the part RDC included):<ref>Schedule 1, Representation of the People Act 1948, c. 65.</ref>\n*The borough of Llanelly;\n*The urban districts of Ammanford, Burry Port and Cwmamman;\n*The rural district of Llanelly and the parish of Bettws in the rural district of Llandilo.\n\nAt the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] the official spelling of the constituency name was altered to '''Llanelli'''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Over 1,800 candidates for 630 seats in Commons |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=9 June 1970 |page=10}}</ref> This followed the change in name of both the borough and rural district in 1966.<ref>The borough was renamed on 4 March 1966 and the rural district on 3 May 1966 {{cite book|title=Census of England and Wales 1961.

The district level local government units contained in the constituency were the Borough of Llanelli and Wards 2\u20136 and 9 of the Borough of [[Dinefwr Borough Council|Dinefwr]].\n\n'''1997'''\nIn this redistribution the constituency was reduced so that it covered the same area as the [[Llanelli (district)|Borough of Llanelli]].\n\n'''2010'''\nAfter the United Kingdom general election in May 2010, the constituency has comprised the Carmarthenshire County electoral divisions of [[Bigyn (electoral ward)|Bigyn]], [[Burry Port]], [[Bynea]], [[Dafen, Carmarthenshire|Dafen]], [[Elli (electoral division)|Elli]], [[Felinfoel]], [[Glanymor]], [[Glyn (electoral ward)|Glyn]], [[Hendy]], [[Hengoed, Carmarthenshire|Hengoed]], [[Kidwelly]], [[Llangennech]], [[Llannon]], [[Lliedi]], [[Llwynhendy]], [[Pembrey]], [[Pontyberem]], Swiss Valley, [[Trimsaran]], [[Tycroes]] and [[Tyisha]].\n\nThe constituency includes the whole of 9 Carmarthenshire [[Local government in Wales#Communities|communities]] ([[Kidwelly]]; [[Llanedi]]; [[Llanelli]]; [[Llanelli Rural]];  [[Llangennech]]; [[Llannon]]; [[Pembrey and Burry Port Town]]; [[Pontyberem]]; and [[Trimsaran]]).\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{Rayment-hc|l|3|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]] || [[Josiah Towyn Jones]] || [[Liberal Party (UK)|Coalition Liberal]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]] || [[John Henry Williams (Welsh politician)|John Henry Williams]] || [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[1936 Llanelli by-election|1936 by-election]] || [[Jim Griffiths]] || [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]] || [[Denzil Davies]] || [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]] || [[Nia Griffith]] || [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|}\n\n==History==\nLlanelli has traditionally been an ultra-safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat, with a Labour MP representing the constituency since 1922. It was represented by one-time deputy leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], Jim Griffiths, from 1936 until his retirement in 1970. In recent years however Labour's majority has been somewhat eroded by [[Plaid Cymru]], who as of 2016 have won the [[Llanelli (Assembly constituency)|equivalent seat]] in the [[Welsh Assembly]] in two of the five Assembly elections to date. At the 2015 general election, however, the Labour majority increased once again.\n\n==Elections==\n[[File:Llanelli election results.png|center|thumb|737x737px|Llanelli election

From 1918 to 1970 the official spelling of the constituency name was '''Llanelly'''. It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election.\n\nThe [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli Welsh Assembly constituency]] was created with the same boundaries in 1999.\n\n==Boundaries==\n'''1918'''\nThe constituency was established in 1918, as a division of [[Carmarthenshire]], located in the south east of the county. This area had, until 1918, been the southern part of the constituency of [[East Carmarthenshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Carmarthenshire]].\n\nIt consisted of the then local authority areas of the [[Municipal Borough]] of Llanelly; the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]]s of [[Ammanford]], [[Burry Port]] and [[Cwmamman]]; the [[Rural District]]s of Lanelly and part of [[Llandeilo|Llandilofawr]] (namely the civil parishes of [[Betws, Carmarthenshire|Betws]], [[Llandybie]] and [[Quarter Bach]], and Ward I of the civil parish of Llandilo Rural)<ref>[[Representation of the People Act 1918]], Ninth Schedule, Part II, Parliamentary Counties: Wales and Monmouthshire.</ref>\n\nThe division bordered [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]] to the west and north, [[Brecon and Radnor (UK Parliament constituency)|Brecon and Radnor]] to the north east, [[Neath (UK Parliament constituency)|Neath]] to the east, [[Gower (UK Parliament constituency)|Gower]] to the south east and the sea to the south.\n\n'''1950'''\nIn the next redistribution of constituencies in Wales, which took effect in 1950, the northern boundary of the constituency was slightly altered. Llanelly no longer bordered [[Brecon and Radnor (UK Parliament constituency)|Brecon and Radnor]] and Gower was extended north and took over the part of the 1918 Neath constituency that had previously adjoined Carmarthenshire. The constituency area continued to include the same local authorities as in 1918 (apart from a spelling change to [[Llandeilo|Llandilo]] for the part RDC included):<ref>Schedule 1, Representation of the People Act 1948, c. 65.</ref>\n*The borough of Llanelly;\n*The urban districts of Ammanford, Burry Port and Cwmamman;\n*The rural district of Llanelly and the parish of Bettws in the rural district of Llandilo.\n\nAt the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] the official spelling of the constituency name was altered to '''Llanelli'''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Over 1,800 candidates for 630 seats in Commons |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=9 June 1970 |page=10}}</ref> This followed the change in name of both the borough and rural district in 1966.<ref>The borough was renamed on 4 March 1966 and the rural district on 3 May 1966 {{cite book|title=Census of England and Wales 1961.

The local authorities remained the same (apart from spelling changes):\n*The borough of Llanelli;\n*the urban districts of Ammanford, Burry Port and Cwmamman;\n*the rural district of Llanelli and the parish of Bettws in the rural district of Llandeilo.<ref name=1970order>The Parliamentary Constituencies (Wales) Order 1970 (1970/1675).</ref>\n\nThe substantial [[Local Government Act 1972|local government changes]] which took effect in 1974 did not affect this redistribution as it used the boundaries as they existed in November 1970 to construct parliamentary constituencies.<ref name=1970order/>\n\n'''1983'''\nThe redistribution altered the constituency by 8.4%. 96.2% of the new constituency had been in the old one. 3.8% of the electors came from the former Carmarthen constituency.\n\nThe area now formed part of the new county of [[Dyfed]]. The district level local government units contained in the constituency were the Borough of Llanelli and Wards 2\u20136 and 9 of the Borough of [[Dinefwr Borough Council|Dinefwr]].\n\n'''1997'''\nIn this redistribution the constituency was reduced so that it covered the same area as the [[Llanelli (district)|Borough of Llanelli]].\n\n'''2010'''\nAfter the United Kingdom general election in May 2010, the constituency has comprised the Carmarthenshire County electoral divisions of [[Bigyn (electoral ward)|Bigyn]], [[Burry Port]], [[Bynea]], [[Dafen, Carmarthenshire|Dafen]], [[Elli (electoral division)|Elli]], [[Felinfoel]], [[Glanymor]], [[Glyn (electoral ward)|Glyn]], [[Hendy]], [[Hengoed, Carmarthenshire|Hengoed]], [[Kidwelly]], [[Llangennech]], [[Llannon]], [[Lliedi]], [[Llwynhendy]], [[Pembrey]], [[Pontyberem]], Swiss Valley, [[Trimsaran]], [[Tycroes]] and [[Tyisha]].\n\nThe constituency includes the whole of 9 Carmarthenshire [[Local government in Wales#Communities|communities]] ([[Kidwelly]]; [[Llanedi]]; [[Llanelli]]; [[Llanelli Rural]];  [[Llangennech]]; [[Llannon]]; [[Pembrey and Burry Port Town]]; [[Pontyberem]]; and [[Trimsaran]]).\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{Rayment-hc|l|3|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]] || [[Josiah Towyn Jones]] || [[Liberal Party (UK)|Coalition Liberal]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]] || [[John Henry Williams (Welsh politician)|John Henry Williams]] || [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[1936 Llanelli by-election|1936 by-election]] || [[Jim Griffiths]] || [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]] || [[Denzil Davies]] || [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]] || [[Nia Griffith]] || [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|}\n\n==History==\nLlanelli has traditionally been an ultra-safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat, with a Labour MP representing the constituency since 1922. It was represented by one-time deputy leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], Jim Griffiths, from 1936 until his retirement in 1970. In recent years however Labour's majority has been somewhat eroded by [[Plaid Cymru]], who as of 2016 have won the [[Llanelli (Assembly constituency)|equivalent seat]] in the [[Welsh Assembly]] in two of the five Assembly elections to date. At the 2015 general election, however, the Labour majority increased once again.\n\n==Elections==\n[[File:Llanelli election results.png|center|thumb|737x737px|Llanelli election

From then on, he and other members of ''Action Fran\u00e7aise'' (like [[Jacques Bainville]], [[:fr:Jean Rivain|Jean Rivain]], and [[Georges Valois]]) interested in Sorel's thought discussed the similarity between the movements in ''Action Fran\u00e7aise'''s conferences and in essays published in the movement's newspaper, hoping to form a collaboration with revolutionary syndicalists. Such collaboration was formed in 1908 with a group of labor unions' leaders led by [[\u00c9mile Janvion]] . As a result of this collaboration, Janvion founded the journal ''[[Terre libre]]''.\n\n=== Beginning (1909) ===\nThe collaboration between the integral nationalism of ''Action Fran\u00e7aise'' and the revolutionary syndicalism of Georges Sorel began in 1909. The connection was formed after Sorel read the second edition of Maurras' book, ''Enqu\u00eate sur la monarchie''. Maurras favorably mentioned Sorel and revolutionary syndicalism in the book, and even sent a copy of the new edition to Sorel. Sorel read the book, and in April 1909 wrote a praising letter to Maurras. Three months later, on 10 July, Sorel published in ''Il Divenire sociale'' (the leading journal of Italian revolutionary syndicalism), an essay admiring Maurras and ''Action Fran\u00e7aise''. Sorel based his support on his anti-democratic thought. For example, he claimed that ''Action Fran\u00e7aise'' was the only force capable to fight against democracy.<ref>\n\"A vigorous protest had to be made against this spirit of decadence: no other group except Action fran\u00e7aise was able to fulfill a role requiring both literacy and faith.

A prospectus for the new journal was published in July 1910, signed by both revolutionary syndicalists (Georges Sorel and [[\u00c9douard Berth]]) and ''Action Fran\u00e7aise'' members ([[Jean Variot]], [[Pierre Gilbert]] and Georges Valois). ''La cit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise'' never got off the ground because of Georges Valois's animosity toward Jean Variot.\n\nAfter the failure of ''La cit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise'', Sorel decided to found his own journal. Sorel's biweekly review, called ''L'Ind\u00e9pendance'', was published from March 1911 to July 1913.

It was formulated in [[Spain]] by [[Ramiro Ledesma Ramos]] in a manifesto published in his periodical ''[[La Conquista del Estado]]'' on 14 March 1931.\nNational syndicalism was intended to win over the anarcho-syndicalist [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) to a corporatist nationalism. Ledesma's manifesto was discussed in the CNT congress of 1931. However, the National Syndicalist movement effectively emerged as a separate political tendency. Later the same year, [[Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]] was formed, and subsequently voluntarily fused with [[Falange|Falange Espa\u00f1ola]]. In 1936 Franco forced a further less voluntary merger with traditionalist [[Carlism]], to create a single party on the Nationalist side of the Spanish Civil War.\nDuring the war, Falangists fought against the Second Spanish Republic, which had the armed support of CNT.\nIt was one of the ideological bases of [[Francoist Spain]], especially in the early years.\n\nThe ideology was present in [[Portugal]] with the [[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|Movimento Nacional-Sindicalista]] (active in the early 1930s), its leader [[Francisco Rol\u00e3o Preto]] being a collaborator of Falange ideologue [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]].\n\nThe Spanish version theory has influenced the [[Kataeb Party]] in [[Lebanon]], the [[National Radical Camp Falanga]] in [[Poland]] and various [[Falangism in Latin America|Falangist groups in Latin America]].\n\nThe [[Unidad Falangista Monta\u00f1esa]] maintained a [[trade union]] wing, called the Association of National-Syndicalist Workers.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Corporatism]]\n* [[Fascism]]\n* [[Economics of Fascism]]\n* [[Faisceau]]\n* [[Proto-fascism]]\n* [[Spanish Trade Union Organisation]]\n* [[Third Position]]\n* [[State Capitalism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last1=Sternhell|first1=Zeev|authorlink1=Zeev Sternhell|last2=Sznajder|first2=Mario|last3=Ash\u00e9ri|first3=Maia|title=The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution|url=https://archive.org/details/birthoffascistid00ster|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|edition=Third printing, and first paperback printing|year= 1995|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-03289-0}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sternhell|first=Zeev|title=Neither right nor left: fascist ideology in France|year=1986|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, New Jersey|edition=2nd|authorlink=Zeev Sternhell|isbn=978-0-691-00629-1}}\n\n{{Fascism}}\n{{Nationalism}}\n{{Syndicalism}}\n\n[[Category:Fascism]]\n[[Category:Francoist Spain]]\n[[Category:National syndicalism| ]]\n[[Category:Syncretic political movements]]\n[[Category:Third Position]]\n[[Category:Anti-capitalism]]\n[[Category:Anti-communism]]\n[[Category:Economics of fascism]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{Distinguish|National Socialism}}\n{{Fascism sidebar}}\n{{Falangism sidebar}}\n{{Francoism sidebar}}\n'''National syndicalism''' is an ideology combining [[integral nationalism]] with [[syndicalism]].

Mussolini was one of the first to disseminate this term, explaining that \"Fascist syndicalism is national and productivistic\u2026 in a national society in which labor becomes a joy, an object of pride and a title to nobility.\"<ref>A.

It was formulated in [[Spain]] by [[Ramiro Ledesma Ramos]] in a manifesto published in his periodical ''[[La Conquista del Estado]]'' on 14 March 1931.\nNational syndicalism was intended to win over the anarcho-syndicalist [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) to a corporatist nationalism. Ledesma's manifesto was discussed in the CNT congress of 1931. However, the National Syndicalist movement effectively emerged as a separate political tendency. Later the same year, [[Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]] was formed, and subsequently voluntarily fused with [[Falange|Falange Espa\u00f1ola]]. In 1936 Franco forced a further less voluntary merger with traditionalist [[Carlism]], to create a single party on the Nationalist side of the Spanish Civil War.\nDuring the war, Falangists fought against the Second Spanish Republic, which had the armed support of CNT.\nIt was one of the ideological bases of [[Francoist Spain]], especially in the early years.\n\nThe ideology was present in [[Portugal]] with the [[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|Movimento Nacional-Sindicalista]] (active in the early 1930s), its leader [[Francisco Rol\u00e3o Preto]] being a collaborator of Falange ideologue [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]].\n\nThe Spanish version theory has influenced the [[Kataeb Party]] in [[Lebanon]], the [[National Radical Camp Falanga]] in [[Poland]] and various [[Falangism in Latin America|Falangist groups in Latin America]].\n\nThe [[Unidad Falangista Monta\u00f1esa]] maintained a [[trade union]] wing, called the Association of National-Syndicalist Workers.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Corporatism]]\n* [[Fascism]]\n* [[Economics of Fascism]]\n* [[Faisceau]]\n* [[Proto-fascism]]\n* [[Spanish Trade Union Organisation]]\n* [[Third Position]]\n* [[State Capitalism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last1=Sternhell|first1=Zeev|authorlink1=Zeev Sternhell|last2=Sznajder|first2=Mario|last3=Ash\u00e9ri|first3=Maia|title=The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution|url=https://archive.org/details/birthoffascistid00ster|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|edition=Third printing, and first paperback printing|year= 1995|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-03289-0}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sternhell|first=Zeev|title=Neither right nor left: fascist ideology in France|year=1986|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, New Jersey|edition=2nd|authorlink=Zeev Sternhell|isbn=978-0-691-00629-1}}\n\n{{Fascism}}\n{{Nationalism}}\n{{Syndicalism}}\n\n[[Category:Fascism]]\n[[Category:Francoist Spain]]\n[[Category:National syndicalism| ]]\n[[Category:Syncretic political movements]]\n[[Category:Third Position]]\n[[Category:Anti-capitalism]]\n[[Category:Anti-communism]]\n[[Category:Economics of fascism]]\n", "name_user": "NewRuins012", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_syndicalism"}

No formal procedure or formality is required for setting up a sole proprietary concern.\n\n*Partnership\n\nA partnership is a business relationship entered into by a formal agreement between two or more persons or corporations carrying on a business in common. The capital for a partnership is provided by the partners who are liable for the total debts of the firms and who share the profits and losses of the business concern according to the terms of the partnership agreement.\n\nPartnerships (other than banking companies) are generally limited in size to twenty partners. The interest of a partner is transferable only with the prior consent of the other partner(s). However, a partner's right to a share of the partnership income may be received in trust for another person.\n\nFor taxation purposes, partnerships are classified into:\n\n(i) Registered Firms\n(ii) Unregistered Firms\n\nThe income of the registered firm is subject to Super Tax before distribution to the partners. Also the individual income of the partners is subject to income tax at the usual rates.\n\nFor unregistered firms, income tax is levied on the firm's income and the partners are not liable to pay tax on the shares of profit received from the unregistered firm(s).\n\n*Company\n\nA company is a legal entity formed under the Companies Ordinance, 1984. It can have share capital or can be formed without share capital.\n\nA company having share capital may be formed as:\n\n(i) A company limited by shares.\n(ii) A company limited by guarantee.\n(iii) An unlimited company.\n\n*Company Limited by Shares\n\nThe liability of its members is limited to the extent of their shares in the paid-up capital of the company. These companies may further be classified as public limited and private limited companies.\n\n*Public Limited Companies can be formed by at least seven persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. The word 'Limited' is used as the last word of its name.\n*Private Limited Companies may be formed by at least two persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. A private limited company, by its Articles of Association:\n\n(i) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;\n(ii) Limits the number of its members to fifty; and;\n(iii) Prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures of the company.\n\nA private limited company is required to use the words \"(Private) Limited\" as the last words of its name.\n\n*Company Limited By Guarantee\n\nMeans a company having the liability of its members limited by memorandum to such amounts as the members may respectively undertake to contribute to the capital of the company in the event of its winding up. A company limited by guarantee is usually formed on a 'non profit basis'. Companies limited by guarantee use the words (Guarantee) Limited\" as the last words of their n\nUnlimited Company\n\nMeans a company having unlimited liability of its members\n\n[https://www.secp.gov.pk https://www.secp.gov.pk]\n\n==Peru==\n*[[S.A.

Under the tax rules, an entity may be classified as a [[corporation]], a [[partnership]], a [[cooperative]] or a disregarded entity. A corporation may be taxed as either a [[C corporation]] or elect to be treated as a [[Subchapter S corporation]]. A disregarded entity has one owner (or a married couple as owner) that is not recognized for tax purposes as an entity separate from its owner. Types of disregarded entities include single-member [[Limited liability company|LLC]]s; qualified sub-chapter S subsidiaries and qualified [[real estate investment trust]] subsidiaries. A disregarded entity's transparent tax status does not affect its status under state law. For example, for federal tax purposes, a sole-member LLC (SMLLC) is disregarded, so that all its assets and liabilities are treated as owned by its single member.

A bank chartered by a state cannot have \"national\" in its name.\n\nFor a savings bank (formerly called a savings and loan association) or credit union, the key word is \"federal\", and the same rules apply; a federally chartered savings bank or credit union must have the word \"federal\" in its name, while a state chartered savings bank or credit union cannot have \"federal\" in its name.\n\n*FSB ([[Federal savings bank|Federal Savings Bank]]), formerly called federal savings and loan association\n*NA ([[National bank#United States|National Association]]), a designation used by banks chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)\n*NT&SA ([[National Trust and Savings Association]]), a less common designation used by national banks\n*[[Credit union#United States|Federal Credit Union]], chartered by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA)\n\nMany federal governmental units are specially formed [[Government-owned corporation|public corporation]]s, while some private organizations have received a [[Congressional charter|charter from Congress]].\n\n===State, territory or commonwealth incorporated===\n{{See also|United States corporate law|Delaware General Corporation Law|Nevada corporation}}\n\nThe following are the main business designations and types:\n*'''[[Sole proprietorship]]''': a business consisting of a single owner (which may in turn be a business entity), not in a separately recognized business form.\n*'''[[Trust company|Trust]]'''\n\n====Partnerships====\n*'''[[General partnership]]''': a partnership in which all the partners are jointly and separately liable for the debts of the partnership. In most U.S. states, it can be created by agreement without requiring a public filing. The partners may themselves be legal entities or individuals.\n*[[Limited partnership|LP]], '''Limited partnership''': a partnership where at least one partner (the general partner, which may itself be an entity or an individual) has unlimited liability for the LP's debts and one or more partners (the limited partners) have limited liability (which means that they are not responsible for the LP's debts beyond the amount they agreed to invest). Limited partners generally do not participate in the management of the entity or its business. \n*[[Limited liability partnership|LLP]], '''Limited Liability Partnership''': a partnership where a partner's liability for the debts of the partnership is limited except in the case of liability for acts of professional negligence or malpractice. In some states, LLPs may only be formed for purposes of practicing a licensed profession, typically attorneys, accountants and architects. This is often the only form of limited partnership allowed for law firms (as opposed to general partnerships).\n*[[Limited liability limited partnership|LLLP]], '''Limited Liability Limited Partnership''': a combination of LP and LLP, available in some states.\n\n====Limited Liability Companies====\n*[[Limited liability company|LLC]], LC, Ltd. Co., '''Limited Liability Company''': a form of business whose owners enjoy limited liability, but which is not a [[corporation]]. Allowable abbreviations vary by state. Note that in some states ''Ltd.'' by itself is not a valid abbreviation for an LLC, because in some states (e.g. [[Texas]]), it may denote a corporation instead. See also [[Series LLC]]. For U.S. federal tax purposes, in general, an LLC with two or more members is treated as a partnership, and an LLC with one member is treated as a sole proprietorship.\n*[[Limited liability company#Variations|PLLC]], '''Professional Limited Liability Company''': some states do not allow certain professionals to form an LLC that would limit the liability that results from the services professionals provide such as doctors, medical care; lawyers, legal advice; and accountants, accounting services; architects, architectural services; when the company formed offers the services of the professionals. Instead those states allow a PLLC or in the LLC statutes, the liability limitation only applies to the business side, such as creditors of the company, as opposed to the client/customer service side, the level of medical care, legal services, or accounting provided to clients. This is meant to maintain the higher ethical standards that these professionals have committed themselves to by becoming licensed in their profession and to prevent them from being immune (or at least limit their immunity) to malpractice suits.\n\n====Corporations====\n*[[Corporation|Corp.]], [[Incorporation (business)|Inc.]], '''Corporation, Incorporated''': used to denote [[corporation]]s ([[public company|public]] or otherwise). These are the only terms universally accepted by all 51 corporation chartering jurisdictions in the United States. However, in some states other suffixes may be used to identify a corporation, such as Ltd., Co./Company, or the Italian term S.p.A. (in [[Connecticut]]; see under [[#Italy|Italy]]). Some states that allow the use of \"Company\" prohibit the use of \"and Company\", \"and Co.\", \"& Company\" or \"& Co.\". In most states [[sole proprietorship]]s and partnerships may register a fictitious \"[[doing business as]]\" name with the word \"Company\" in it. For a full list of allowed designations by state, see the table below. \n*'''[[Professional corporation]]''', PC or P.C.: those corporate entities for which many corporation statutes make special provision, regulating the use of the corporate form by licensed professionals such as attorneys, architects, accountants, and doctors.\n*'''[[Doing Business As]]''': denotes a business name used by a person or entity that is different from the person's or entity's true name. DBAs are not separate entities and do not shield the person or entity who uses the DBA as a business name from liability for debts or lawsuits. Filing requirements vary and are not permitted for some types of businesses or professional practices.

These include [[corporation]]s, [[cooperative]]s, [[partnership]]s, [[sole trader]]s, [[limited liability company|limited liability companies]] and other specifically permitted and labelled types of entities. The specific rules vary by country and by state or province. Some of these types are listed below, by country.

No formal procedure or formality is required for setting up a sole proprietary concern.\n\n*Partnership\n\nA partnership is a business relationship entered into by a formal agreement between two or more persons or corporations carrying on a business in common. The capital for a partnership is provided by the partners who are liable for the total debts of the firms and who share the profits and losses of the business concern according to the terms of the partnership agreement.\n\nPartnerships (other than banking companies) are generally limited in size to twenty partners. The interest of a partner is transferable only with the prior consent of the other partner(s). However, a partner's right to a share of the partnership income may be received in trust for another person.\n\nFor taxation purposes, partnerships are classified into:\n\n(i) Registered Firms\n(ii) Unregistered Firms\n\nThe income of the registered firm is subject to Super Tax before distribution to the partners. Also the individual income of the partners is subject to income tax at the usual rates.\n\nFor unregistered firms, income tax is levied on the firm's income and the partners are not liable to pay tax on the shares of profit received from the unregistered firm(s).\n\n*Company\n\nA company is a legal entity formed under the Companies Ordinance, 1984. It can have share capital or can be formed without share capital.\n\nA company having share capital may be formed as:\n\n(i) A company limited by shares.\n(ii) A company limited by guarantee.\n(iii) An unlimited company.\n\n*Company Limited by Shares\n\nThe liability of its members is limited to the extent of their shares in the paid-up capital of the company. These companies may further be classified as public limited and private limited companies.\n\n*Public Limited Companies can be formed by at least seven persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. The word 'Limited' is used as the last word of its name.\n*Private Limited Companies may be formed by at least two persons by subscribing their names to the 'Memorandum and Articles of Association' of the company. A private limited company, by its Articles of Association:\n\n(i) Restricts the right to transfer its shares;\n(ii) Limits the number of its members to fifty; and;\n(iii) Prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures of the company.\n\nA private limited company is required to use the words \"(Private) Limited\" as the last words of its name.\n\n*Company Limited By Guarantee\n\nMeans a company having the liability of its members limited by memorandum to such amounts as the members may respectively undertake to contribute to the capital of the company in the event of its winding up. A company limited by guarantee is usually formed on a 'non profit basis'. Companies limited by guarantee use the words (Guarantee) Limited\" as the last words of their n\nUnlimited Company\n\nMeans a company having unlimited liability of its members\n\n[https://www.secp.gov.pk https://www.secp.gov.pk]\n\n==Peru==\n*[[S.A.

There is no limit on the liability of its members. It is not a requirement under company law to add or state the word or designation Unlimited or its abbreviations (Unltd., or Ultd.) at the ending of its legal company name, and most such companies do not do so. Unlimited companies are exempted from filing [[financial statements|accounts]] with the [[Registrar of Companies]] for public disclosure, subject to a few exceptions (unless the company was a qualified subsidiary or a parent of a limited company during the accounting period).\n*'''[[Sole proprietorship]]''' (Sole traders)wyatt\n\n==United States==\nIn the United States, the individual states incorporate most businesses. Very few special types are incorporated by the federal government.\n\n=== Tax classifications ===\nFor federal tax purposes, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has separate [[entity classification]] rules. Under the tax rules, an entity may be classified as a [[corporation]], a [[partnership]], a [[cooperative]] or a disregarded entity. A corporation may be taxed as either a [[C corporation]] or elect to be treated as a [[Subchapter S corporation]]. A disregarded entity has one owner (or a married couple as owner) that is not recognized for tax purposes as an entity separate from its owner. Types of disregarded entities include single-member [[Limited liability company|LLC]]s; qualified sub-chapter S subsidiaries and qualified [[real estate investment trust]] subsidiaries. A disregarded entity's transparent tax status does not affect its status under state law. For example, for federal tax purposes, a sole-member LLC (SMLLC) is disregarded, so that all its assets and liabilities are treated as owned by its single member. But under state law, an SMLLC can contract in its own name and its owner is generally not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the entity.<ref name=\"Presti and Naegele Newsletter\">[http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity Presti and Naegele Newsletter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115173503/http://www.prestinaegele.com/faq-what-is-a-disregarded-entity# |date=2013-01-15 }}, 4 April 2012.</ref> To be recognized as a [[Cooperative]] for tax purposes Cooperatives must follow certain rules under Sub Chapter T of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].<ref name=\"IRS Sub Chapter T\">{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184|title=IRS Sub Chapter T|accessdate=15 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904163915/http://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-044-001.html#d0e184#d0e184|archive-date=2014-09-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Federally incorporated===\nThe key word for a bank is \"national\". A bank chartered by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC) must have the word \"national\" in its name. A bank chartered by a state cannot have \"national\" in its name.\n\nFor a savings bank (formerly called a savings and loan association) or credit union, the key word is \"federal\", and the same rules apply; a federally chartered savings bank or credit union must have the word \"federal\" in its name, while a state chartered savings bank or credit union cannot have \"federal\" in its name.\n\n*FSB ([[Federal savings bank|Federal Savings Bank]]), formerly called federal savings and loan association\n*NA ([[National bank#United States|National Association]]), a designation used by banks chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)\n*NT&SA ([[National Trust and Savings Association]]), a less common designation used by national banks\n*[[Credit union#United States|Federal Credit Union]], chartered by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA)\n\nMany federal governmental units are specially formed [[Government-owned corporation|public corporation]]s, while some private organizations have received a [[Congressional charter|charter from Congress]].\n\n===State, territory or commonwealth incorporated===\n{{See also|United States corporate law|Delaware General Corporation Law|Nevada corporation}}\n\nThe following are the main business designations and types:\n*'''[[Sole proprietorship]]''': a business consisting of a single owner (which may in turn be a business entity), not in a separately recognized business form.\n*'''[[Trust company|Trust]]'''\n\n====Partnerships====\n*'''[[General partnership]]''': a partnership in which all the partners are jointly and separately liable for the debts of the partnership. In most U.S. states, it can be created by agreement without requiring a public filing. The partners may themselves be legal entities or individuals.\n*[[Limited partnership|LP]], '''Limited partnership''': a partnership where at least one partner (the general partner, which may itself be an entity or an individual) has unlimited liability for the LP's debts and one or more partners (the limited partners) have limited liability (which means that they are not responsible for the LP's debts beyond the amount they agreed to invest). Limited partners generally do not participate in the management of the entity or its business. \n*[[Limited liability partnership|LLP]], '''Limited Liability Partnership''': a partnership where a partner's liability for the debts of the partnership is limited except in the case of liability for acts of professional negligence or malpractice. In some states, LLPs may only be formed for purposes of practicing a licensed profession, typically attorneys, accountants and architects. This is often the only form of limited partnership allowed for law firms (as opposed to general partnerships).\n*[[Limited liability limited partnership|LLLP]], '''Limited Liability Limited Partnership''': a combination of LP and LLP, available in some states.\n\n====Limited Liability Companies====\n*[[Limited liability company|LLC]], LC, Ltd. Co., '''Limited Liability Company''': a form of business whose owners enjoy limited liability, but which is not a [[corporation]]. Allowable abbreviations vary by state. Note that in some states ''Ltd.'' by itself is not a valid abbreviation for an LLC, because in some states (e.g. [[Texas]]), it may denote a corporation instead. See also [[Series LLC]]. For U.S. federal tax purposes, in general, an LLC with two or more members is treated as a partnership, and an LLC with one member is treated as a sole proprietorship.\n*[[Limited liability company#Variations|PLLC]], '''Professional Limited Liability Company''': some states do not allow certain professionals to form an LLC that would limit the liability that results from the services professionals provide such as doctors, medical care; lawyers, legal advice; and accountants, accounting services; architects, architectural services; when the company formed offers the services of the professionals. Instead those states allow a PLLC or in the LLC statutes, the liability limitation only applies to the business side, such as creditors of the company, as opposed to the client/customer service side, the level of medical care, legal services, or accounting provided to clients. This is meant to maintain the higher ethical standards that these professionals have committed themselves to by becoming licensed in their profession and to prevent them from being immune (or at least limit their immunity) to malpractice suits.\n\n====Corporations====\n*[[Corporation|Corp.]], [[Incorporation (business)|Inc.]], '''Corporation, Incorporated''': used to denote [[corporation]]s ([[public company|public]] or otherwise). These are the only terms universally accepted by all 51 corporation chartering jurisdictions in the United States. However, in some states other suffixes may be used to identify a corporation, such as Ltd., Co./Company, or the Italian term S.p.A. (in [[Connecticut]]; see under [[#Italy|Italy]]). Some states that allow the use of \"Company\" prohibit the use of \"and Company\", \"and Co.\", \"& Company\" or \"& Co.\". In most states [[sole proprietorship]]s and partnerships may register a fictitious \"[[doing business as]]\" name with the word \"Company\" in it. For a full list of allowed designations by state, see the table below. \n*'''[[Professional corporation]]''', PC or P.C.: those corporate entities for which many corporation statutes make special provision, regulating the use of the corporate form by licensed professionals such as attorneys, architects, accountants, and doctors.\n*'''[[Doing Business As]]''': denotes a business name used by a person or entity that is different from the person's or entity's true name. DBAs are not separate entities and do not shield the person or entity who uses the DBA as a business name from liability for debts or lawsuits. Filing requirements vary and are not permitted for some types of businesses or professional practices.
