Their earliest graves were usually dug at random in designated local burial grounds, sometimes marked with upright [[slate]], [[sandstone]] or [[granite]] stones containing factual but inelegant inscriptions. The next generation of colonialists decorated their headstones with carvings; the most impressive examples consists of depictions of death's head; a stylized skull sometimes with wings or crossed bones.<ref name=\"BGov\">\"[https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/iconography-gravestones-burying-grounds Iconography of Gravestones at Burying Grounds]\". [[Boston City Hall]], October 25 2019. Retrieved April 11 2020</ref>  Early New England puritan [[funerary art]] conveys a practical attitude towards 17th mortality rates; death was an ever present reality of life,<ref>Ludwig(2000), p. 52</ref> and provides an unique insight into their views on mortality and death.\n\nLater examples show the deceased carried by the wings that would apparently take the deceased soul to heaven.<ref name=\"wb206\">Wenhworth (2003), p. 206</ref> From the 1690s the imagery becomes less severe, and began to include winged [[cherubs]] (known as \"soul effigies\") who had fuller faces and rounder and more life-sized eyes and mouths.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nThe minimalist artistry of the earlier designs reflect the puritan's stern religious doctrine, and largely avoided unnecessary decoration or embellishment. In the late 18th century, depictions of coffins, [[urn]]s and willows became common.<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 82</ref>\n\n== Stonecarvers==\nThe craftsmen and woman who designed and built the headstones were most often locally commissioned generalists who also worked as smiths, leather-workers or printers. They tended to produce locally, and there are no known [[journeyman]] or itinerant carvers producing across a wide geographical area. A significant number of surviving examples share a decorative traditions, which some variation between regions,<ref name=\"d502\" /> and through [[probate]] documentation, newspaper announcements and inscripted signatures, researches have been able to associate the carvers behind particular headstones with identifiable historical people.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nPuritan era carvers were especially preoccupied by economy of [[Line art|line]], [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes and, at times abstract patterns. The show a  unstylized \"primitive\"<ref name=\"r431\">Ludwig (2000), p.431</ref> approach that tended towards simplicity and naturalism. As the approach is not detectable in later American art, the historian Allan Ludwig described it as a \"half-finished experiment in form making. Its place...must therefore be described as one of quite isolation. Nothing of the older tradition remained after 1815 but the silence of a forgotten epoch.\"<ref name=\"r428\">Ludwig (2000), p.428</ref>\n\n==Early burial places==\nAccording to writer Meg Greene the earliest Puritan New England \"burying grounds were simply places to deposit the remains of the dead\".<ref name=\"G13\" /> \nThey sought to avoid use of the traditional Catholic cross, while table type tombs were seen as too elaborate.<ref>Garvan (1960), p. 112</ref> This was in part because the earliest settlers sought to avoid the worship of ancestors through stone images. \nThe graves had little order to their plotting,{{efn-ua|Individual plots were often dug in random spots in the burial ground. See Green (2017), p. 13}}<ref name=\"G13\">Greene (2007), p. 13</ref> and were either unmarked, or were marked a by wooden sign or an uncut rock, with only very few having a simple greenstone or carved [[headstone]],<ref name=\"h342\">Hijiya (1983), p. 342</ref> usually with no decorations or ornamentation.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nWhen inscriptions began to be used, they are at first brief, factual and typically carved with \"interruptive punctuation\", that is an [[interpunct]] (raised period), between each word.<ref name=\"BGov\" /> Full names, kinship, age at death and the year of death are given, while the dating of placement of the stone itself is also present; typically the were commissioned and erected with a year of the burial.<ref name=\"d502\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 502</ref> \n\nBy the mid-17th century, the headstones had become increasingly elaborate, describing the nature and frequency of death in dark, bleak and often bitter imagery.<ref name=\"G13\" /> Soon after, a significant number contain [[epitaphs]], the tone of which is often correlated with the severity or bleakness of the design.<ref name=\"d502\" /> In 1980, the historian Peter Benes described one such graveyard in Plymouth County in terms of \"menacing stares, impish smiles, and enigmatic facial contortions combine with totally abstract effigies to stop the modern viewer in his tracks, while revealing little of their significance\".<ref>Prioli (1980), p. 335</ref>\n\n==Attitude towards death==\n[[File:New England death Head (c).jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Death's head, Boston MA]]\n[[File:Christian Hunter More.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Gravestone of Christian Hunter More, wife of [[Richard More (Mayflower passenger)|Richard More]], The Burying Point, [[Salem, Massachusetts]]]]\nPuritan grave art reflects a deliberate move away from the European [[Baroque|High Baroque]] type. Because its first generation craftsmen developed their craft isolated in the new word, as self thught, their works can be described as [[folk art|folk style]].<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 244</ref> In this the their output reflects a general move towards a more vernacular and direct mode of expression, but practically, the style allowed the production of  a far greater number of stylized headstones by removing the need for the carvers having deep workshop experience.<ref name=\"l249\" /> Although the New England style was heavily influenced by contemporary or slightly earlier trends in rural England and Scotland,<ref name=\"l249\">Ludwig (2000), p. 249</ref> this was more in terms of iconography and symbols than style.<ref name=\"l258\">Ludwig (2000), p. 258</ref> New England art of the time did not use Biblical allegories, or contain depictions of the [[Christian cross]].<ref name=\"l258\" />\n\nAlthough modern society sharply avoids the reality of everyday disposal of its communities' dead, in puritan society these were common facts of life. Thus, their art reflects a pragmatic approach, embracing realistic imagery that evokes human decay into skulls and bones. Their use of simplistic, line drawn imagery was a deliberate rejection of Catholic [[iconography]], a choice also reflected in the design of their churches, portrait paintings and [[stained glass]].<ref>Garvan (1960), p. 108</ref>\n\nA common approach in the 1980s and 1990s in academic literature was to treat these older graveyards as [[museum]]s, that is as \"outdoor, spatially delineated repositories of cultural artifacts\",<ref name=\"m2\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 2</ref> and as material to understand the thoughts of the people who had created them. The historian [[Terry G. Jordan-Bychkov|Terry G. Jordan]] agrees with this, and said that, given such artifact's density and state of preservation in New   England, \"nowhere else [in America] is it possible to look so deeply into our people's past\".<ref name=\"m2\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 2</ref> Meyer's takes this further, writing that the grave art of this period \"exhibit patterns of change over temporal spans...and...can in many instances yield valuable cultural insights to a number of discrete time periods, including the present.\"<ref name=\"m2\" /> Following Forbes work, researchers applied [[social sciences]] techniques in interpretation.<ref name=\"m3\" />\n\nThe cultural historian Hijiya urged caution and rose concerns on the prevailing academic approach and methodology, and noted how the early carvers left no account record of their intentions, and so their motives cannot be easily interpreted, and observed that there is no remaining instance of any articulated evidence which indicates even \"their outlook on life and death.\"<ref name=\"h339-40\">Hijiya (1983), pp. 339-340</ref> Although a significant scholar in the field, Hijiya urges that reading into the meaning of any stone has to consider \"information extraneous to the stones themselves\" such as \"writings produced at the same time as the carvings, though by different hands [and] aesthetic or anthropological theory which purports to illuminate human behavior at any time\".<ref name=\"h340\">Hijiya (1983), p. 340</ref> Hijiya suggested an approach similar to the art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]], that there is no reason to assume that any decoration is \"uniquely determined.\"<ref name=\"h340\" />\n\nHijiya brakes Northeastern American gravestones into six broad and overlapping styles reflective of \"six different attitudes toward death\".<ref name=\"h341\">Hijiya (1983), p. 341</ref> Of these, the first three are strictly \"puritan\", before the style softened as  [[Unitarianism]] and [[Methodism]] became more popular.<ref name=\"d508\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 508</ref>\n\nThe six styles are:\n# \"Plain Style\" (1640-1710): Resignation \n# \"Death's Head\" (1670-1770): Awe\n# \"Angel\" (or \"Cherub\") (1740-1820): Confidence\n# \"Urn and Willow\" (1780-1850): Mourning \n# \"Monumentalism\" (1840-1920): Defiance\n# \"Modem Plain Style\" (1900-2001): Ignorance<ref name=\"h341\" />\n\nAccording to Hijiya, the Plain Style \"is hardly a style at all\", consisting of little more than un-ornamented, factual and inscriptions. It begins in the very early Colonial period, and lasts until roughly the first decade of the Eighteenth century. In most scholarly overviews, the amateurish carvings are attributed to a lack of tools, and know-how on the part of the very early practitioners, who did have access to more experienced stonemasons.

Their earliest graves were usually dug at random in designated local burial grounds, sometimes marked with upright [[slate]], [[sandstone]] or [[granite]] stones containing factual but inelegant inscriptions. The next generation of colonialists decorated their headstones with carvings; the most impressive examples consists of depictions of death's head; a stylized skull sometimes with wings or crossed bones.<ref name=\"BGov\">\"[https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/iconography-gravestones-burying-grounds Iconography of Gravestones at Burying Grounds]\". [[Boston City Hall]], October 25 2019. Retrieved April 11 2020</ref>  Early New England puritan [[funerary art]] conveys a practical attitude towards 17th mortality rates; death was an ever present reality of life,<ref>Ludwig(2000), p. 52</ref> and provides an unique insight into their views on mortality and death.\n\nLater examples show the deceased carried by the wings that would apparently take the deceased soul to heaven.<ref name=\"wb206\">Wenhworth (2003), p. 206</ref> From the 1690s the imagery becomes less severe, and began to include winged [[cherubs]] (known as \"soul effigies\") who had fuller faces and rounder and more life-sized eyes and mouths.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nThe minimalist artistry of the earlier designs reflect the puritan's stern religious doctrine, and largely avoided unnecessary decoration or embellishment. In the late 18th century, depictions of coffins, [[urn]]s and willows became common.<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 82</ref>\n\n== Stonecarvers==\nThe craftsmen and woman who designed and built the headstones were most often locally commissioned generalists who also worked as smiths, leather-workers or printers. They tended to produce locally, and there are no known [[journeyman]] or itinerant carvers producing across a wide geographical area. A significant number of surviving examples share a decorative traditions, which some variation between regions,<ref name=\"d502\" /> and through [[probate]] documentation, newspaper announcements and inscripted signatures, researches have been able to associate the carvers behind particular headstones with identifiable historical people.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nPuritan era carvers were especially preoccupied by economy of [[Line art|line]], [[Geometry|geometric]] shapes and, at times abstract patterns. The show a  unstylized \"primitive\"<ref name=\"r431\">Ludwig (2000), p.431</ref> approach that tended towards simplicity and naturalism. As the approach is not detectable in later American art, the historian Allan Ludwig described it as a \"half-finished experiment in form making. Its place...must therefore be described as one of quite isolation. Nothing of the older tradition remained after 1815 but the silence of a forgotten epoch.\"<ref name=\"r428\">Ludwig (2000), p.428</ref>\n\n==Early burial places==\nAccording to writer Meg Greene the earliest Puritan New England \"burying grounds were simply places to deposit the remains of the dead\".<ref name=\"G13\" /> \nThey sought to avoid use of the traditional Catholic cross, while table type tombs were seen as too elaborate.<ref>Garvan (1960), p. 112</ref> This was in part because the earliest settlers sought to avoid the worship of ancestors through stone images. \nThe graves had little order to their plotting,{{efn-ua|Individual plots were often dug in random spots in the burial ground. See Green (2017), p. 13}}<ref name=\"G13\">Greene (2007), p. 13</ref> and were either unmarked, or were marked a by wooden sign or an uncut rock, with only very few having a simple greenstone or carved [[headstone]],<ref name=\"h342\">Hijiya (1983), p. 342</ref> usually with no decorations or ornamentation.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nWhen inscriptions began to be used, they are at first brief, factual and typically carved with \"interruptive punctuation\", that is an [[interpunct]] (raised period), between each word.<ref name=\"BGov\" /> Full names, kinship, age at death and the year of death are given, while the dating of placement of the stone itself is also present; typically the were commissioned and erected with a year of the burial.<ref name=\"d502\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 502</ref> \n\nBy the mid-17th century, the headstones had become increasingly elaborate, describing the nature and frequency of death in dark, bleak and often bitter imagery.<ref name=\"G13\" /> Soon after, a significant number contain [[epitaphs]], the tone of which is often correlated with the severity or bleakness of the design.<ref name=\"d502\" /> In 1980, the historian Peter Benes described one such graveyard in Plymouth County in terms of \"menacing stares, impish smiles, and enigmatic facial contortions combine with totally abstract effigies to stop the modern viewer in his tracks, while revealing little of their significance\".<ref>Prioli (1980), p. 335</ref>\n\n==Attitude towards death==\n[[File:New England death Head (c).jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Death's head, Boston MA]]\n[[File:Christian Hunter More.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Gravestone of Christian Hunter More, wife of [[Richard More (Mayflower passenger)|Richard More]], The Burying Point, [[Salem, Massachusetts]]]]\nPuritan grave art reflects a deliberate move away from the European [[Baroque|High Baroque]] type. Because its first generation craftsmen developed their craft isolated in the new word, as self thught, their works can be described as [[folk art|folk style]].<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 244</ref> In this the their output reflects a general move towards a more vernacular and direct mode of expression, but practically, the style allowed the production of  a far greater number of stylized headstones by removing the need for the carvers having deep workshop experience.<ref name=\"l249\" /> Although the New England style was heavily influenced by contemporary or slightly earlier trends in rural England and Scotland,<ref name=\"l249\">Ludwig (2000), p. 249</ref> this was more in terms of iconography and symbols than style.<ref name=\"l258\">Ludwig (2000), p. 258</ref> New England art of the time did not use Biblical allegories, or contain depictions of the [[Christian cross]].<ref name=\"l258\" />\n\nAlthough modern society sharply avoids the reality of everyday disposal of its communities' dead, in puritan society these were common facts of life. Thus, their art reflects a pragmatic approach, embracing realistic imagery that evokes human decay into skulls and bones. Their use of simplistic, line drawn imagery was a deliberate rejection of Catholic [[iconography]], a choice also reflected in the design of their churches, portrait paintings and [[stained glass]].<ref>Garvan (1960), p. 108</ref>\n\nA common approach in the 1980s and 1990s in academic literature was to treat these older graveyards as [[museum]]s, that is as \"outdoor, spatially delineated repositories of cultural artifacts\",<ref name=\"m2\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 2</ref> and as material to understand the thoughts of the people who had created them. The historian [[Terry G. Jordan-Bychkov|Terry G. Jordan]] agrees with this, and said that, given such artifact's density and state of preservation in New   England, \"nowhere else [in America] is it possible to look so deeply into our people's past\".<ref name=\"m2\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 2</ref> Meyer's takes this further, writing that the grave art of this period \"exhibit patterns of change over temporal spans...and...can in many instances yield valuable cultural insights to a number of discrete time periods, including the present.\"<ref name=\"m2\" /> Following Forbes work, researchers applied [[social sciences]] techniques in interpretation.<ref name=\"m3\" />\n\nThe cultural historian Hijiya urged caution and rose concerns on the prevailing academic approach and methodology, and noted how the early carvers left no account record of their intentions, and so their motives cannot be easily interpreted, and observed that there is no remaining instance of any articulated evidence which indicates even \"their outlook on life and death.\"<ref name=\"h339-40\">Hijiya (1983), pp. 339-340</ref> Although a significant scholar in the field, Hijiya urges that reading into the meaning of any stone has to consider \"information extraneous to the stones themselves\" such as \"writings produced at the same time as the carvings, though by different hands [and] aesthetic or anthropological theory which purports to illuminate human behavior at any time\".<ref name=\"h340\">Hijiya (1983), p. 340</ref> Hijiya suggested an approach similar to the art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]], that there is no reason to assume that any decoration is \"uniquely determined.\"<ref name=\"h340\" />\n\nHijiya brakes Northeastern American gravestones into six broad and overlapping styles reflective of \"six different attitudes toward death\".<ref name=\"h341\">Hijiya (1983), p. 341</ref> Of these, the first three are strictly \"puritan\", before the style softened as  [[Unitarianism]] and [[Methodism]] became more popular.<ref name=\"d508\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 508</ref>\n\nThe six styles are:\n# \"Plain Style\" (1640-1710): Resignation \n# \"Death's Head\" (1670-1770): Awe\n# \"Angel\" (or \"Cherub\") (1740-1820): Confidence\n# \"Urn and Willow\" (1780-1850): Mourning \n# \"Monumentalism\" (1840-1920): Defiance\n# \"Modem Plain Style\" (1900-2001): Ignorance<ref name=\"h341\" />\n\nAccording to Hijiya, the Plain Style \"is hardly a style at all\", consisting of little more than un-ornamented, factual and inscriptions. It begins in the very early Colonial period, and lasts until roughly the first decade of the Eighteenth century. In most scholarly overviews, the amateurish carvings are attributed to a lack of tools, and know-how on the part of the very early practitioners, who did have access to more experienced stonemasons. This explains in part why it remained in some areas later than others; with craftsmen in some areas developing their skills quicker than in others.<ref>Hijiya (1983), pp. 341-342</ref> A further reason may be that the early puritans, due to their feelings on humility and lack of regard for adornments, deliberately kept their headstones simple and minimalist.<ref name=\"h342\" /> Hijiya goes on to say that the lack of decoration may have reflected that they viewed death as simply as an \"ordinary, unremarkable aspect of the human condition\", absent from any notion of either oblivion oe passing on to ethereal life.<ref name=\"h343\">Hijiya (1983), p. 343</ref>\n\nA significant amount of stones for the Eighteenth century contain [[epithet]]s, so it becomes possible to tell something of the attitudes and outlook of both the masons and the deceased.<ref name=\"d502\" />\n\n==Inscriptions==\n===Epitaphs===\nEpitaphs become common from the later 17th century.

George Mottershead collected animals such as [[lizard]]s and insects that arrived with exotic plants imported by the business. A visit to [[Belle Vue Zoo]] in Manchester as a boy in 1903 fuelled his developing interest in creating a zoo of his own.\n\nMottershead was wounded in the [[First World War]] and spent several years in a wheelchair. Despite this, his collection of animals grew and he began to search for a suitable home for his zoo. He chose [[Oakfield Manor]] in [[Upton by Chester]], which was a country village then but now is a suburb of [[Chester]]. He bought Oakfield Manor for \u00a33,500 in 1930.<ref name=history>{{cite web |title=From Polar Bears to Pandas: The History of Chester Zoo |publisher=Chester City Council |url=http://www.chester.gov.uk/tourism_and_leisure/culture_and_leisure/chester_history_and_heritage/past_exhibitions/from_polar_bears_to_pandas.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012024332/http://www.chester.gov.uk/tourism_and_leisure/culture_and_leisure/chester_history_and_heritage/past_exhibitions/from_polar_bears_to_pandas.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 October 2008 |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=20 June 2008 }}</ref> The house had {{convert|9|acre}} of gardens and provided easy access to the railways and to Manchester and [[Liverpool]]. There were local objections, but Mottershead prevailed, and Chester Zoo opened to the public on 10 June 1931.<ref name=\"goodzoos\"/> The first animals were displayed in pens in the courtyard.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nAn [[Ordnance Survey]] [http://www.ponies.me.uk/maps/osmap.html?z=14&x=-2.8887176513671875&y=53.2235588799907 inch-a-mile map] published in 1936 shows the area around as farmland and villages and marks the present Zoo area north of Oakfield as \"Butter Hill\".\n\nRapid expansion followed after the [[Second World War]], despite the difficulty of sourcing materials. Mottershead had to be resourceful; the [[polar bear]] exhibit (1950) was built from recycled wartime road blocks and [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]].<ref name=\"history\" /> \"Always building\" was the zoo's slogan at the time. Mottershead received the [[OBE]], an honorary degree of MSc, and served as President of the International Union of Zoo Directors. He died in 1978 aged 84.\n\n===Zoo design===\nMottershead wanted to build a zoo without the traditional [[Victorian era|Victorian]] iron bars to cage the animals.<ref>{{cite book|title=Veterinary medicine: a guide to historical sources|first=Pamela|last=Hunter|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-7546-4053-1|page=455}}</ref> He was influenced by the ideas of [[Carl Hagenbeck]], who invented the modern zoo concept and by [[Heini Hediger]], a pioneer of [[ethology]].\n\nAt Chester, Mottershead took Hagenbeck's idea for moats and ditches as an alternative to cage bars, and extended their use throughout the zoo, often with species that Hagenbeck had not considered. For example, when [[chimpanzee]]s were released into their new enclosure at Chester in 1956, a group of grassy islands, they were separated from visitors by no more than a {{convert|12|ft|adj=on}} strip of water. Nobody knew then if chimps could swim. It turned out that they could not, and today the chimp islands are a centrepiece of Chester Zoo.\n\nIn 1986 the zoo was enclosed with a fence, in line with the [[Zoo Licensing Act 1981]].<ref>{{cite web | title = The Zoo Estate | work = Chester Zoo website | url = http://www.chesterzoo.co.uk/corporate.asp?Page=130 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20031224105452/http://www.chesterzoo.co.uk/corporate.asp?Page=130 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 24 December 2003 | accessdate = 28 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nRealm of the Red Ape, an [[Indonesia]]n-forest-themed exhibit, featuring [[threatened species|threatened]] [[Sumatran orangutan|Sumatran]] and [[Bornean orangutan]], opened in May 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Realm of the Red Ape Conservation Programme|url=http://www.chesterzoo.org/conservation-and-research/field-conservation/field-programmes/realm-of-the-red-ape-conservation-programme|website=Chester Zoo|accessdate=2016-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207105843/http://www.chesterzoo.org/conservation-and-research/field-conservation/field-programmes/realm-of-the-red-ape-conservation-programme|archive-date=7 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2009, Chester Zoo unveiled ''Natural Vision'', a \u00a3225 million plan to transform itself into the largest conservation attraction in Europe.

It included a water ride to take visitors through the exhibit.

For many years, a single bridge (now called Elephants' Bridge), drivable by zoo vehicles and powered wheelchairs, near the elephant exhibit was the only crossing place within the grounds. A second crossing, passable by pedestrians and [[mobility scooter]]s, called Bats' Bridge, opened in April 2008 near the Twilight Zone, has improved the ability of visitors to circulate.\n\nThere are other ways to travel around the zoo:\n*A transportation system, now generally known as the [[monorail]], with a station at the main entrance near the elephants (Tsavo Station, which was formerly known as the Monkey Island Station) and a station near the lions (Jubilee Square Station). It runs in a circle, but riders are only permitted to make single journeys of a half circle.\n*A circular boat trip operates on the Lazy River in the Islands exhibit.\nVisitors must pay extra for using the monorail, but the boat trip in Islands is included in normal zoo admission.\n[[File:Jaguar building Chester Zoo 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The Jaguar Building]]\nChester's catering facilities include ''Bemb\u00e9 Kitchen'' near the main entrance which opened in 2006. ''June's Pavilion'' is on the west of the zoo and ''Manado Street Kitchen'' is found on Sulawesi in the Islands exhibit. The ''Oakfield Restaurant'', in a Victorian mansion house near the lion enclosure, and the ''Acorn Bar'', are both used for private functions as well as catering to zoo visitors.\n\nThere are children's play areas, shops, kiosks and several picnic lawns around the zoo. A second pedestrian entrance is located in the southeast corner of the zoo behind Oakfield House.\n\nFor a long time the public entrance was at the east end off Caughall Road. In recent years the public entrance has moved to the north side with dedicated access off the A41 Chester By-Pass. Thus the zoo is entered in the 'newer' part west of Flag Lane, near the elephants, and the old car parks at the east end are being built over with service and educational buildings.\n\nThe zoo owns land outside the public area, and uses that land to grow food for its [[herbivorous]] animals.\n\n===Monorail===\n[[File:Monorail at Chester Zoo 2.jpg|thumb|right|The Chester Zoo monorail.]]\n{{commons category|Chester Zoo monorail}}\nA [[monorail]] system was built and installed by Computerised People Mover International at a cost of $4&nbsp;million and then opened by the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]] in 1991.<ref name=\"next-stop\">{{cite journal|url=http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/record/tris/00635385.html|title=Next Stop for the Peoplemover (Abstract)|date=July 1992|journal=Urban Transport International&nbsp;\u2013 Peoplemovers Update Supplement|first=B H|last=North|publisher=Landor Publishing Limited|quote=Computerised People Mover International have developed a straddling monorail which is in use at Chester Zoo.}}</ref><ref name=\"tms\">{{cite web|url=http://www.monorails.org/tMspages/Chstrzo.html|title=Chester Zoo|work=Monorails of Europe|publisher=The Monorail Society|accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"local-history-group\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofuptonbychester.org.uk/zoo.html|title=Historical Archives of the site of Upton's Zoo|publisher=Upton-by-Chester Local History Group|accessdate=25 July 2009|quote=in 1991 the duchess of Kent opened the zoo monorail.}}</ref> The system is 1 mile (1\u00bd km) long and travels on an elevated guideway to give views of the park grounds&nbsp;\u2013 the track crosses Flag Lane twice on its one-way circular shape.

A male Sumatran orangutan was born at the zoo in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-merseyside-50607136/chester-zoo-welcomes-endangered-baby-orangutan|title=Zoo welcomes endangered baby orangutan|website=[[BBC News Online]]|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> A further enclosure houses a group of [[lar gibbon]]s.\n\nAnimals and plants from [[Indonesia]] are exhibited inside Realm of the Red Ape in a rainforest-themed setting. Birds on display include [[blue-crowned hanging parrot]]s, [[Timor sparrow]]s, [[chestnut-backed thrush]]es, [[Crested partridge|roul-roul partridge]]s, [[superb fruit dove]]s and [[black-naped fruit dove]]s. [[Varanus salvadorii|Crocodile monitor]]s, [[reticulated python]]s, [[Gonyosoma oxycephalum|red-tailed racer]]s, [[Gonocephalus bellii|Bell's Angle-Head Lizard]]s, [[Chinese water dragon]]s, [[emerald tree monitor]]s, [[white-lipped tree viper]]s and [[Morelia viridis|green tree python]]s feature among the reptiles. Invertebrates include [[Rhinoceros beetle]]s, [[Golden silk orb-weaver|Golden Silk Spider]]s, [[jungle nymph]]s, [[Euploea core|Common Crows]], [[Arachnacris corporalis|Malaysian Katydid]]s and [[Phylliidae|leaf insect]]s.\n\nLocated next to Realm of the Red Ape is an enclosure for [[oriental small-clawed otter]]s. The zoos [[Sumatran orangutan|Sumatran Orang-utan]]s were relocated from Realm of the Red Ape to a new exhibit in the Islands development during January 2016.\n\n===The Chimpanzee Breeding Centre===\n[[File:Chimpanzees Chester Zoo.jpg|thumb|A chimpanzee group]]\nThis pavilion was opened in 1989 by [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana, Princess of Wales and Countess of Chester]], and is home to 26 [[Western chimpanzee]]s. This is the largest colony of chimps in Europe, housed in the Roundhouse, a conical indoor enclosure linked to an outside moated island. The island is planted with many bushes and has large poles for the chimps to climb on. The inside area has a climbing frame that allows the chimps to stay close together on several levels of platform. There are seven interconnected off-show dens.\n\n[[File:Aa 2006 05 10 okapis.jpg|right|thumb|The two [[okapi]]s at the zoo]]\n\n===Tsavo Black Rhino Reserve===\nThe zoo's [[black rhinoceros]] exhibit, modelled on the [[Tsavo West National Park|Tsavo National Park]] in Kenya, was opened in 2003 at a cost of [[GBP]]2 million. The zoo has a successful breeding programme for the Eastern Black Rhino and has successfully bred 8 calves between 2008 and 2018. [[Meerkat]]s and [[cape porcupine]]s are kept in a co-inhabited enclosure nearby, and a nearby paddock is home to [[warthog]]s.\n\n===The Wetlands and Tsavo Bird Safari===\n''The Wetlands'' features a large African [[Wetland]] Aviary alongside Tsavo and is home to [[Black Stork]]s, [[Black Crowned Crane]]s, [[Baer's Pochard]]s, [[White-headed duck]]s, [[White-Faced Whistling Duck]]s and other waterfowl. In 2009, a walk-through bird safari with African bird species opened. It currently houses [[von der decken's hornbill]]s, [[lilac-breasted roller]]s, [[hamerkop]]s, [[weaver bird]]s, [[Blacksmith plover]]s, [[Red-winged starling]]s and a variety of waterfowl, amongst other species. At the other side of the Bird Safari is a Large pen for [[wattled crane]]s and Black crowned cranes.\n\n===Fruit Bat Forest===\n''Fruit Bat Forest'' is the largest free-flying [[bat]] cave in Europe. The cave holds two species of bat: [[Rodrigues fruit bat]]s, and [[Seba's short-tailed bat]]s. It is also home to a varied collection of other species including, [[common tenrec]]s and [[blind cave fish]].\n\n===Monkey Islands===\n'''Monkey Islands''' was opened in 1997, replacing the old monkey house, and is currently home to four monkey species: [[Colombian spider monkey|Colombian black spider monkeys]], [[mandrill]]s, [[lion-tailed macaque]]s and [[Golden-bellied capuchin|Buffy-headed capuchin]]s. [[Campbell's mona monkey|Campbell's guenon]]s and [[porcupine]]s were formerly housed with the mandrills, and [[Celebes crested macaque|Sulawesi crested macaque]]s were kept here until they moved to 'Islands' in 2015. Visitors enter the monkey house and view the animals from a central corridor. Each species has a glass-fronted indoor enclosure with climbing apparatus and an outdoor enclosure, moated and heavily planted.\n\n===Miniature Monkeys===\n'''Miniature Monkeys''', opened in May 2004, consists of two enclosures. The first is home to a pair of [[pied tamarin]]s with [[pygmy marmoset]]s, and the second is shared by three [[emperor tamarin]]s and three [[golden-headed lion tamarin]]s. [[Azara's agouti]]s, [[Geoffrey's marmoset]]s, [[black-tailed marmoset]]s, [[black lion tamarin]]s, [[Coppery Titi|Red Titi]] and [[white-faced saki]]s have also been housed here in the past but have been moved out for various reasons.\n\n===Bears of the Cloud Forest===\n'''Bears of the Cloud Forest''' opened in 2004 and is home to a pair of [[spectacled bear]]s and other South American animals. The purpose-built exhibit is designed to mimic the bear's natural habitat by providing trees and a rocky terrain. Nearby are paddocks housing [[capybara]]s, [[Giant anteater]] and [[South American Tapir|Brazilian tapir]]s.\n\n[[Guanaco]] and [[Vicuna]] were previously housed with [[Rhea (bird)|Rhea]].\nThe zoo's first spectacled bear cub was born in January 2017.\n\n===Secret World of the Okapi===\nFormerly the camel house, this enclosure adjoining the giraffe house was remodelled in 2006 to house [[okapi]]. Initially two males were kept: Dicky arrived from [[Marwell Wildlife]] in 2005 and Mbuti came from [[Bristol Zoo]] in the same year. In 2006 Dicky left for [[London Zoo]] to make way for a female named Stuma from Germany. In 2009 Mbuti and Dicky were swapped back, with Mbuti going to London Zoo and Dicky coming back to Chester. Other animals that can be seen here include [[Red forest duiker]]s, [[butterfly barb]]s, and [[short-eared elephant shrew]]s. [[Spiny mouse|Mount Kulal spiny mice]] and [[Rhabdomys|Mesic four-striped grass mice]] have also been kept here in the past along with various other small species. The Okapi bred for the first time in 2012, producing a female calf named Tafari. Two further Okapi calves were born in 2014 and 2018 respectively\n\n[[File:fountain chester zoo.jpg|right|thumb|The fountain and gardens in front of ''Islands in Danger'']]\n\n===Dragons in Danger===\nThis exhibit is primarily a [[herpetarium]] for the zoo's [[Komodo dragon]] It was opened in 1998 and extended in 2003 to include an outdoor enclosure used by the dragons in the warmer summer months. The exhibit is built on the site of the zoo's former bird house. In 2007, several young baby Komodo dragons were put on display after one of the zoo's two females laid eggs which hatched although the female had not been mated; this is [[parthenogenesis]], the first such case recorded in this species.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6196225.stm |title='Virgin births' for giant lizards |work=BBC News |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=20 June 2008}}</ref> The exhibit was revamped in 2009 to house [[Iguana|Caribbean iguana]]s in one section of the building. It now currently houses [[Spiny turtle|spiny-hill turtle]]s, [[golden coin turtle]]s, and [[Indochinese box turtle]]s in one side and the critically endangered [[Leptodactylus fallax|Mountain chicken frog]]s with some [[Caribbean hermit crab]]s in the other.\n\n'''Dragons in Danger''' also houses various Indonesian and [[Philippine]] rainforest birds, such as [[Palawan peacock-pheasant]]s, [[pheasant pigeon]]s, [[Montserrat oriole]]s and [[Visayan tarictic hornbill]]s. Recently added was a pair of [[Philippine mouse deer]] which have successfully bred. Also housed here are [[Angonoka tortoise|Ploughshare tortoise]]s, [[collared iguana]]s and [[Cyrtopholis|Montserrat Tarantula]]s which Chester bred in 2016 for the first time in captivity. Species formerly kept in the exhibit include [[Socorro dove]]s, [[Mindanao bleeding-heart]]s, [[Papuan lorikeet]]s and [[Saint Lucia amazon|Saint Lucia parrot]]s.\n\n===Mongoose Mania===\nLocated near the former tiger enclosure, this area used to be a petting farm, but was closed due to an outbreak of [[foot-and-mouth disease]]. The petting farm is now a picnic lawn and a former [[kune kune pig]] enclosure has been demolished in favour of a food stall.\n\n'''Mongoose Mania''', which houses [[Common dwarf mongoose|dwarf mongoose]]s features tunnels beneath the enclosure which allow children to crawl through, popping up their heads into plastic domes to give them a mongoose's eye view of the world.\n\n===Giant otters and penguins===\nIn early 2010, the [[Californian sea lion]]s left the collection. Over the late winter the pool was converted to house a new species to the zoo. The [[giant otter]]s went on show for the first time on 26 March 2010. The zoo bred their first pups in 2013.\n\nIn the neighbouring enclosure, a large breeding group of over 50 [[Humboldt penguin]]s have their own pool, and visitors can watch the birds from an underwater viewing window.\n\n===Tropical Realm===\nChester's '''Tropical Realm''' is Britain's largest tropical house at over 26,000 cubic metres. Opened in 1964, most of the interior is an open-plan space extending to roof level and themed with pools and mature tropical plants, with pathways for visitors through the undergrowth. Here, more than 30 species of birds are free-flying, including [[Nicobar pigeon]]s, various species of [[starling]]s and ground birds such as [[crested partridge]]s.\n\nAviaries and vivaria are arranged around the sides of the building; those on the upper level were originally designed for [[birds of paradise]] and the [[hornbill]] aviaries were originally made for [[gorilla]]s. The aviaries currently house birds such as [[great Indian hornbill]]s, [[rhinoceros hornbill]]s, two pairs of [[tarictic hornbill]] (one pure-bred and one hybrid), [[writhed-billed hornbill]]s, [[red-crested turaco]]s, [[Palawan peacock-pheasant]]s, [[Congo peafowl]], [[Bali starling]]s, [[Western crowned pigeon|blue-crowned pigeon]]s, [[fairy-bluebird]]s, [[white-rumped shama]], [[white-crested turaco]]s, [[Snowy-crowned robin-chat]]s, [[Mindanao bleeding-heart]]s [[Green aracari]] and [[Luzon Scops Owl]]s. At the entrance is an aviary for [[Sumatran laughingthrush]]es and [[grey-winged blackbird]].\n\nThe Tropical Realm is also the centre of the reptile collection. The [[crocodile]] pools (which formerly housed [[Dwarf crocodile|West African dwarf crocodiles]], [[American alligator]]s and [[Philippine crocodile]]s) currently house [[spectacled caiman]]s in one and [[white-winged wood duck]]s and a [[yellow-faced myna]] in the other. Near the entrance is an enclosure for [[tuatara]]s. This lizard-like species from New Zealand is the last surviving [[Sphenodontia|sphenodont]], a prehistoric group of reptiles, and Chester is the only British zoo to exhibit them. In February 2016, a tuatara hatched for the first time outside of New Zealand, leading Chester Zoo to be the only zoo to have bred them anywhere else. There were many varieties of snakes and lizards in the past (many had to depart as a result) ; [[emerald tree boa]]s and [[Orthriophis moellendorffi|Moellendorf's ratsnake]]s now being the only remaining. The lizard collection is now made up of [[Laemanctus|Serrated casquehead iguana]]s, [[Graham's anole]]s, [[Dracaena (lizard)|caiman lizard]]s, and a [[Parson's chameleon]].\n\n[[Tortoise]]s are represented by [[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise|Gal\u00e1pagos]] and [[radiated tortoise|radiated]]. Amphibians include [[Poison dart frog]]s, [[Golden mantella]]s, [[Blue-legged mantella]]s, a [[typhlonectes natans|Rio Cauca caecilian]], [[Borneo eared frog]]s and [[Morelet's Tree Frog]]s.\n\nThere is also a pair of [[Philippine mouse-deer]] near the poison dart frogs.\n\nIn the Winter of 2015/2016 the former [[Golden-bellied capuchin|Yellow Breasted Capuchin]] exhibit at the rear of Tropical Realm was converted to house a pair of [[Aye-Aye]] and a group of [[Malagasy giant rat|Malagasy Giant Jumping Rat]]s.\n\n===European Aviary===\nThis aviary was formerly home to [[Andean condor]]s but is now the home to a variety of European birds after '''Europe on the Edge''' was demolished in late 2017. The species include here consist of [[European black vulture]]s, (being the zoo's last birds of prey). There are also [[Eurasian spoonbill]]s, [[northern bald ibis]]es and [[little egret]]s as well as a selection of [[waterfowl]]. Smaller birds include [[rock dove]]s, [[azure-winged magpie]]s and the native but rare [[red-billed chough]].\n\n[[File:Vulture Chester Zoo.jpg|thumb|A vulture at the zoo]]\n\n===Rare Parrot Breeding Centre===\n[[File:Ara glaucogularis -Chester Zoo -upper body-8b.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blue-throated macaw]].]]\n{{commons category|Ara glaucogularis in Chester Zoo}}\nParrots on display here include [[red-vented cockatoo]]s, [[lesser sulphur-crested cockatoo]]s, [[Red-and-blue lory|red-and-blue lories]], [[Chattering lory|yellow-backed chattering lories]], [[Mindanao lorikeet|Mount Apo lorikeet]]s and [[blue-and-yellow macaw]]s. The only ones on show are [[Ecuador Amazon]]s. Most of the birds were moved to the '''Rare Parrot Breeding Centre''' from the old parrot house when it was demolished in 2005 to make way for Realm of the Red Ape.\n\n===Magnificent Macaws===\nThis exhibit consists of two aviaries housing rare and endangered South American parrots and macaws. These include [[hyacinth macaw]]s, in the aviary outside the Tropical Realm and [[Blue-throated macaw]]s and an [[Inca jay]] are housed in the other.\n\n===Aquarium===\nThe [[aquarium]] is a small and traditional building (one of the oldest at the zoo, built by George Mottershead's daughter and son-in-law in the 1950s) housing a varied collection of freshwater and marine fish, aquatic invertebrates and amphibians. It has had notable success breeding [[seahorse]]s and achieved the first captive breeding of the [[Potamotrygon|freshwater motoro stingray]].\n\nOther notable fish include [[Paretroplus menarambo|Pinstripe Damba]]s, [[Mudskipper]]s, tropical reef fish and various [[Lake Malawi]] [[cichlid]]s. Invertebrates such as [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s and several species of [[coral]] and [[shrimp]]s are housed with the fish.\n\n===Asian Plains and paddocks===\n[[File:Aa chesterzoo scimitarhornedoryx 00.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scimitar-horned oryx]]es]]\n[[Image:Aa chesterzoo sitatunga 00.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sitatunga]]s]]\nIn 2008, '''Asian Plains''' received its official opening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chesterzoo.org/Home/News/May%202008/American%20Entrepreneur%20opens%20the%20Asian%20Plains%20exhibit.aspx |title=Marc Ecko opens Asian Plains exhibit |publisher=www.chesterzoo.org |accessdate=20 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704154946/http://www.chesterzoo.org/Home/News/May%202008/American%20Entrepreneur%20opens%20the%20Asian%20Plains%20exhibit.aspx |archive-date=4 July 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Based around a mixed-species paddock featuring [[Eld's deer|Burmese brow-antlered deer]], the exhibit has recently been extended to include new enclosures for [[Indian rhinoceros|greater one-horned rhinoceros]] and [[cheetah]].\nThe male rhino was joined by a female in 2008 to form a pair which the zoo hoped would breed. Sadly in November 2009 the male Indian rhino \"Patna\" was put down due to a longstanding leg injury. The zoo obtained a replacement male from [[Edinburgh Zoo]] in March 2010. Since they were closely related the previous female departed for a zoo in Spain shortly after, and the zoo are in the progress of creating a breeding situation&nbsp;\u2013 Baabu has now been exchanged for 'Beni' from Pilsen Zoo. 2 Indian rhino calves have been born on the plain, the most recent, a male was born May 2018. The paddocks formerly housed [[barasingha]], [[Ankole cattle]], [[blackbuck]] and [[sitatunga]].\n\nOther paddocks on the west side of the zoo support grazing herds of [[Gr\u00e9vy's zebra]]s, [[sitatunga]], [[Kirk's dik-dik]]s, [[eastern bongo]], and [[roan antelope]].\n\n[[Przewalski's horse]]s left the collection in 2009 to make way for the new [[African wild dog|African hunting dog]] enclosure. Other animals formerly housed here were [[P\u00e8re David's deer]], [[red-necked wallaby|red-necked wallabies]], [[ostrich]]es and [[emu]]s.\n\n===Mkomazi National Park Painted Dogs Conserve===\nIn 2011, a new exhibit housing [[African painted dog]]s on the site of the former [[Przewalski's horse]] paddock was opened. In the style of an African Research Station with an African Village, the exhibit has a dry landscape with fake [[kopje]] stones. A pack of four [[African painted dog]]s are the main exhibit and the first breeding occurred in 2018.  [[Aardvark]]s and [[rock hyrax]]es are nearby.\n\n===Forest Zone===\nThe north east area of the zoo is where many forest-dwelling species are kept. As well as the [[chimpanzee]]s, [[okapi]]s, [[jaguar]]s and Tropical Realm, there are enclosures for [[African forest buffalo|Congo buffalo]], [[red river hog]]s and [[Lowland anoa]]. Nearby is a large paddock and house for the zoo's [[Rothschild's giraffe]] herd. The area between the rear of Tropical Realm and the Spirit of the Jaguar has enclosures for various species including a group of native [[sand lizard]]s, and an aviary for [[red-knobbed curassow|red-billed curassow]]s.\n\nAnimals formerly displayed in forest zone include [[maned wolf|maned wolves]], [[babirusa]], [[warthog]]s, Chilean [[pud\u00fa]], [[Mallorcan midwife toad]]s, [[golden-bellied capuchin]]s, [[visayan warty pig]]s, [[ring-tailed coati]]s and [[bactrian camel]]s.\n\n===Butterfly Journey===\nAn enclosure formerly housing [[maned wolf|maned wolves]] was demolished and replaced in 2008 by a heated [[butterfly]] house called '''Butterfly Journey''', which is based around the life cycle of a butterfly, featuring free-flying butterflies and [[moth]]s (The exotic species on show include [[Morpho peleides|blue morpho]]s, [[Caligo idomeneus|giant owl]]s, [[Greta oto|glasswing]]s, [[Swallowtail butterfly|swallowtail]]s and [[Atlas moth]]s), a cabinet of [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]s, and an area with [[caterpillar]]s. Also featured in this exhibit is an area for a variety of different invertebrates and a mesh enclosure for some [[panther chameleon]]s.\n\n===Big cats===\n[[File:Sumatran tiger Chester Zoo.jpg|thumb|A sumatran tiger at Chester Zoo]]\nAs well as [[jaguar]]s, Chester Zoo keeps [[lions]], [[tiger]]s and [[cheetah]]s<ref name=cheetah>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrexhamleader.co.uk/news/Bank-holiday-is-a-record.4072518.jp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122053612/http://www.wrexhamleader.co.uk/news/Bank-holiday-is-a-record.4072518.jp |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 November 2008 |title=Bank Holiday is a record |publisher=Wrexham Leader |date=12 May 2008 |accessdate=18 June 2008 }}</ref> in its [[big cat]] collection. The lions are the [[Asiatic lion|Asiatic subspecies]] found only in the [[Gir Forest]] in India in the wild. The zoo's former resident male Asoka was joined by a female, Asha, from Rome in 2006. The pair have bred on three occasions, but so far their only offspring to survive has been a male cub, Tejas, born and hand-reared in 2007. His upbringing was featured prominently in the first series of ''[[Chester Zoo#Television documentary|Zoo Days]]''. Tejas left Chester Zoo for [[Besancon]] early in 2008 as part of the European breeding programme for this subspecies. Asoka left the zoo in early 2010, he was moved to [[Rome Zoo]] as part of the European breeding programme. His replacement is 3-year-old Iblis, who arrived from Planckendael Zoo in [[Belgium]]. In late summer 2011, Asha retired to Santillana Zoo and was replaced by four-year females Kiburi and Kumari.\n\nIn 2007, a male [[Sumatran tiger]] called Kepala arrived from [[Dudley Zoo]] to join the two resident female [[Bengal tiger]]s, who left in 2008. The same year, the zoo acquired a female tiger named Kirana, but unfortunately it was discovered that the pair were related. Kepala departed to [[Dublin Zoo]] and a new male named Fabi was brought in from Prague Zoo to form a breeding pair of Sumatrans, a critically endangered subspecies in the wild.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/15966/summ\n|title=Sumatran Tiger\n|work=iucnredlist.org\n|publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]]\n|accessdate=5 March 2008\n}}</ref> Kirana and Fabi bred and have so far bred successfully on three occasions since 2011.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n|url=http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16115518\n|title=Sumatran Tiger Cubs Emerge From Their Den\n|work=sky.com\n|publisher=BskyB\n|accessdate=23 November 2011\n}}</ref>\n\nThe zoo welcomed its first ever cheetah cubs in June 2011.

A paddock which was only visible from the monorail but can now be seen from the Bats' Bridge holds a group of [[Philippine spotted deer]].\n\n===Other exhibits===\n[[File:Aa chesterzoo bluecranes 00.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blue crane]]s]]\n[[File:Aa chesterozoo flamingos 00.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flamingo]]s]]\n\nBordering the paddocks is a waterway running north-south, along which the water bus formerly traveled, past island groups of [[white-faced saki]]s, [[Lac Alaotra bamboo lemur|Alaotran bamboo lemur]]s and [[howler monkey]]s. A variety of callitrichids, including [[cotton-top tamarin]]s, were formerly housed on the Bamboo Lemur Island, and the howler monkey and white-faced saki exhibits were formerly home to [[black-and-white ruffed lemur]]s and [[red ruffed lemur]]s. A nearby island viewable from Bats Bridge has previously held [[lowland anoa]] and is now holding [[babirusa]].\nIn the southeast corner of the zoo are enclosures housing assorted animals including [[bush dog]]s, [[red panda]]s, [[southern pudu]], [[Azara's agouti]], [[Red-billed blue magpie]]s and the wetland bird nursery. The former cassowary exhibit next to the pademelons is now home to [[Pallas's Cat]]s.\n\nNear the Rare Parrot Breeding Centre is a group of aviaries currently housing the zoo's owl collection. This includes: [[spectacled owl]]s, [[great grey owl]]s, [[northern hawk owl]]s, [[brown wood owl]]s, [[southern white-faced owl]]s and [[ural owl]]s. The owl aviaries were recently modified.\n\nAlongside the Arara lawn is a set of recently refurbished aviaries that house various species of Asian songbirds and pheasants.\n\nFlocks of [[Chilean flamingo|Chilean]] and [[American flamingo|Caribbean]] flamingos live in shallow water alongside a large island housing a group of [[ring-tailed lemur]]s and a pair of [[black and white ruffed lemur]]s. The lemurs are to be moved to a new Madagascar themed walk through enclosure in 2018 along with [[Fossa (animal)|Fossa]]. New indoor accommodation for the flamingos was completed in 2007.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012 there was a display of [[animatronic]] dinosaurs: ''[[Triceratops]]'', ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' and its eggs and hatchlings, ''[[Dilophosaurus]]'' (which squirts water from its mouth), ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''[[Rugops]]'', ''[[Omeisaurus]]'', ''[[Apatosaurus]]'', ''[[Baryonyx]]'', ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', ''[[Tyrannosaurus]] rex''. A second exhibition was made in 2012 with other anamatronic dinosaurs featuring: a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', a ''[[Dilophosaurus]]'' and young (which both spit water), a ''[[Megalosaurus]]'', a ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' and hatchlings, a ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', a ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'',\nan ''[[Edmontonia]]'', a ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', two ''[[Coelophysis]]'', a ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'', a ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and a ''[[Tyranosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' and young.\n\n==Membership and adoption==\nThe zoo has a service that gives people the option of adopting an animal of their choice, they are also given two complimentary tickets to allow them to visit the animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chesterzoo.org/support-us/adoptions|title=Animal Adoption - Adopting Animals - Chester Zoo|website=www.chesterzoo.org|accessdate=16 December 2018}}</ref> They can also become members which allows them to visit Chester and a range of other zoos across England free of charge for a year.

George Mottershead collected animals such as [[lizard]]s and insects that arrived with exotic plants imported by the business. A visit to [[Belle Vue Zoo]] in Manchester as a boy in 1903 fuelled his developing interest in creating a zoo of his own.\n\nMottershead was wounded in the [[First World War]] and spent several years in a wheelchair. Despite this, his collection of animals grew and he began to search for a suitable home for his zoo. He chose [[Oakfield Manor]] in [[Upton by Chester]], which was a country village then but now is a suburb of [[Chester]]. He bought Oakfield Manor for \u00a33,500 in 1930.<ref name=history>{{cite web |title=From Polar Bears to Pandas: The History of Chester Zoo |publisher=Chester City Council |url=http://www.chester.gov.uk/tourism_and_leisure/culture_and_leisure/chester_history_and_heritage/past_exhibitions/from_polar_bears_to_pandas.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012024332/http://www.chester.gov.uk/tourism_and_leisure/culture_and_leisure/chester_history_and_heritage/past_exhibitions/from_polar_bears_to_pandas.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 October 2008 |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=20 June 2008 }}</ref> The house had {{convert|9|acre}} of gardens and provided easy access to the railways and to Manchester and [[Liverpool]]. There were local objections, but Mottershead prevailed, and Chester Zoo opened to the public on 10 June 1931.<ref name=\"goodzoos\"/> The first animals were displayed in pens in the courtyard.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nAn [[Ordnance Survey]] [http://www.ponies.me.uk/maps/osmap.html?z=14&x=-2.8887176513671875&y=53.2235588799907 inch-a-mile map] published in 1936 shows the area around as farmland and villages and marks the present Zoo area north of Oakfield as \"Butter Hill\".\n\nRapid expansion followed after the [[Second World War]], despite the difficulty of sourcing materials. Mottershead had to be resourceful; the [[polar bear]] exhibit (1950) was built from recycled wartime road blocks and [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]].<ref name=\"history\" /> \"Always building\" was the zoo's slogan at the time. Mottershead received the [[OBE]], an honorary degree of MSc, and served as President of the International Union of Zoo Directors. He died in 1978 aged 84.\n\n===Zoo design===\nMottershead wanted to build a zoo without the traditional [[Victorian era|Victorian]] iron bars to cage the animals.<ref>{{cite book|title=Veterinary medicine: a guide to historical sources|first=Pamela|last=Hunter|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-7546-4053-1|page=455}}</ref> He was influenced by the ideas of [[Carl Hagenbeck]], who invented the modern zoo concept and by [[Heini Hediger]], a pioneer of [[ethology]].\n\nAt Chester, Mottershead took Hagenbeck's idea for moats and ditches as an alternative to cage bars, and extended their use throughout the zoo, often with species that Hagenbeck had not considered. For example, when [[chimpanzee]]s were released into their new enclosure at Chester in 1956, a group of grassy islands, they were separated from visitors by no more than a {{convert|12|ft|adj=on}} strip of water. Nobody knew then if chimps could swim. It turned out that they could not, and today the chimp islands are a centrepiece of Chester Zoo.\n\nIn 1986 the zoo was enclosed with a fence, in line with the [[Zoo Licensing Act 1981]].<ref>{{cite web | title = The Zoo Estate | work = Chester Zoo website | url = http://www.chesterzoo.co.uk/corporate.asp?Page=130 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20031224105452/http://www.chesterzoo.co.uk/corporate.asp?Page=130 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 24 December 2003 | accessdate = 28 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nRealm of the Red Ape, an [[Indonesia]]n-forest-themed exhibit, featuring [[threatened species|threatened]] [[Sumatran orangutan|Sumatran]] and [[Bornean orangutan]], opened in May 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Realm of the Red Ape Conservation Programme|url=http://www.chesterzoo.org/conservation-and-research/field-conservation/field-programmes/realm-of-the-red-ape-conservation-programme|website=Chester Zoo|accessdate=2016-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207105843/http://www.chesterzoo.org/conservation-and-research/field-conservation/field-programmes/realm-of-the-red-ape-conservation-programme|archive-date=7 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2009, Chester Zoo unveiled ''Natural Vision'', a \u00a3225 million plan to transform itself into the largest conservation attraction in Europe.

It included a water ride to take visitors through the exhibit. ''Natural Vision'' was to eventually include a 90-room hotel, a Conservation College, and a revamped main entrance that would link the zoo to a marina to be developed on zoo land, all to be completed by 2018.<ref name=\"bbc_unveiling\">{{Cite web\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/7852542.stm\n|title=Zoo unveils \u00a3225m transformation\n|work=bbc.co.uk\n|publisher=[[BBC]]\n|date=27 January 2009\n|accessdate=12 August 2012\n}}</ref> Plans went before the public for comment in June 2009.<ref name=\"bbc_public comment\">{{Cite web\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8122980.stm\n|title=Zoo's rainforest plans considered\n|work=bbc.co.uk\n|publisher=[[BBC]]\n|date=28 June 2009\n|accessdate=12 August 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nThe projected Heart of Africa bio-dome, along with plans for the hotel, were shelved in 2011 due to the loss of \u00a340m potential funding when the North West Regional Development Agency was abolished.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Holmes|first1=David|title=Zoo\u2019s bio-dome stalls but joy at \u00a330m exhibit|url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/news/chester-cheshire-news/zoos-bio-dome-stalls-joy-30m-5194171|accessdate=2016-02-07|work=The Chester Chronicle|date=2013-07-23}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2012 planning permission was gained for a later phase of the ''Natural Vision'' masterplan.

For many years, a single bridge (now called Elephants' Bridge), drivable by zoo vehicles and powered wheelchairs, near the elephant exhibit was the only crossing place within the grounds. A second crossing, passable by pedestrians and [[mobility scooter]]s, called Bats' Bridge, opened in April 2008 near the Twilight Zone, has improved the ability of visitors to circulate.\n\nThere are other ways to travel around the zoo:\n*A transportation system, now generally known as the [[monorail]], with a station at the main entrance near the elephants (Tsavo Station, which was formerly known as the Monkey Island Station) and a station near the lions (Jubilee Square Station). It runs in a circle, but riders are only permitted to make single journeys of a half circle.\n*A circular boat trip operates on the Lazy River in the Islands exhibit.\nVisitors must pay extra for using the monorail, but the boat trip in Islands is included in normal zoo admission.\n[[File:Jaguar building Chester Zoo 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The Jaguar Building]]\nChester's catering facilities include ''Bemb\u00e9 Kitchen'' near the main entrance which opened in 2006. ''June's Pavilion'' is on the west of the zoo and ''Manado Street Kitchen'' is found on Sulawesi in the Islands exhibit. The ''Oakfield Restaurant'', in a Victorian mansion house near the lion enclosure, and the ''Acorn Bar'', are both used for private functions as well as catering to zoo visitors.\n\nThere are children's play areas, shops, kiosks and several picnic lawns around the zoo. A second pedestrian entrance is located in the southeast corner of the zoo behind Oakfield House.\n\nFor a long time the public entrance was at the east end off Caughall Road. In recent years the public entrance has moved to the north side with dedicated access off the A41 Chester By-Pass. Thus the zoo is entered in the 'newer' part west of Flag Lane, near the elephants, and the old car parks at the east end are being built over with service and educational buildings.\n\nThe zoo owns land outside the public area, and uses that land to grow food for its [[herbivorous]] animals.\n\n===Monorail===\n[[File:Monorail at Chester Zoo 2.jpg|thumb|right|The Chester Zoo monorail.]]\n{{commons category|Chester Zoo monorail}}\nA [[monorail]] system was built and installed by Computerised People Mover International at a cost of $4&nbsp;million and then opened by the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]] in 1991.<ref name=\"next-stop\">{{cite journal|url=http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/record/tris/00635385.html|title=Next Stop for the Peoplemover (Abstract)|date=July 1992|journal=Urban Transport International&nbsp;\u2013 Peoplemovers Update Supplement|first=B H|last=North|publisher=Landor Publishing Limited|quote=Computerised People Mover International have developed a straddling monorail which is in use at Chester Zoo.}}</ref><ref name=\"tms\">{{cite web|url=http://www.monorails.org/tMspages/Chstrzo.html|title=Chester Zoo|work=Monorails of Europe|publisher=The Monorail Society|accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"local-history-group\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofuptonbychester.org.uk/zoo.html|title=Historical Archives of the site of Upton's Zoo|publisher=Upton-by-Chester Local History Group|accessdate=25 July 2009|quote=in 1991 the duchess of Kent opened the zoo monorail.}}</ref> The system is 1 mile (1\u00bd km) long and travels on an elevated guideway to give views of the park grounds&nbsp;\u2013 the track crosses Flag Lane twice on its one-way circular shape.

The most famous of these was Jubilee (1977\u20132003), so named as he was born in 1977, the year of the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen's Silver Jubilee]]. The zoo currently has a breeding herd of six elephants, composed of two males and four females.\n\nThe elephant house also used to house [[African elephant]]s, [[rhinoceros|rhinos]], [[hippo]]s and [[tapir]]s. [[Motty]], a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] African-Asian elephant calf was born in July 1978, but died in infancy.\n\nA \u00a32 million breeding facility modelled on an [[Assam]] [[rainforest]] called '''Elephants of the Asian Forest''' opened in Easter 2006, as a major alteration of the zoo's previous elephant house. Inside the elephant house, other indigenous Asian species are exhibited, including, [[azure-winged magpie]]s, [[red-billed blue magpie]]s, [[Prevost's squirrel]]s, [[belanger's tree shrew]]s, The former [[arowana]] aquarium now holds [[McCord's box turtle]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Elephants of the Asian Forest | work = Zoolex website | url = http://www.zoolex.org/zoolexcgi/view.py?id=859 | accessdate = 13 June 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160424014510/http://www.zoolex.org/zoolexcgi/view.py?id=859 | archive-date = 24 April 2016 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nFor recent research into a disease risk, see [[Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus]].\n\n===Spirit of the Jaguar===\n[[File:Panthera onca -Chester Zoo, Cheshire, England-8a (1).jpg|thumb|left|Jaguars at Chester Zoo]]\n{{commons category|Panthera onca in Chester Zoo}}\n\n'''Spirit of the Jaguar'''<ref>{{cite web | title = Spirit of the Jaguar | work = Zoolex website | url = http://www.zoolex.org/zoolexcgi/view.py?id=864 | accessdate = 13 June 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160816214419/http://www.zoolex.org/zoolexcgi/view.py?id=864 | archive-date = 16 August 2016 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> was opened in 2001 and is sponsored by [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar Cars]] and was designed by McCormick Architecture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mccormick-architecture.co.uk/projects/commercial/tourism-leisure/ |title=Chester Zoo |publisher=McCormick Architecture |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref> The exhibit is split into four sections.

It comprises a new two-story building linked to the existing orangutan house with three indoor and two outdoor enclosures, providing accommodation for a larger number of apes. The outdoor areas can be viewed from a first floor public gallery and feature mesh roofs supported by tree-like structures which act as climbing frames for the apes. A male Sumatran orangutan was born at the zoo in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-merseyside-50607136/chester-zoo-welcomes-endangered-baby-orangutan|title=Zoo welcomes endangered baby orangutan|website=[[BBC News Online]]|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> A further enclosure houses a group of [[lar gibbon]]s.\n\nAnimals and plants from [[Indonesia]] are exhibited inside Realm of the Red Ape in a rainforest-themed setting. Birds on display include [[blue-crowned hanging parrot]]s, [[Timor sparrow]]s, [[chestnut-backed thrush]]es, [[Crested partridge|roul-roul partridge]]s, [[superb fruit dove]]s and [[black-naped fruit dove]]s. [[Varanus salvadorii|Crocodile monitor]]s, [[reticulated python]]s, [[Gonyosoma oxycephalum|red-tailed racer]]s, [[Gonocephalus bellii|Bell's Angle-Head Lizard]]s, [[Chinese water dragon]]s, [[emerald tree monitor]]s, [[white-lipped tree viper]]s and [[Morelia viridis|green tree python]]s feature among the reptiles. Invertebrates include [[Rhinoceros beetle]]s, [[Golden silk orb-weaver|Golden Silk Spider]]s, [[jungle nymph]]s, [[Euploea core|Common Crows]], [[Arachnacris corporalis|Malaysian Katydid]]s and [[Phylliidae|leaf insect]]s.\n\nLocated next to Realm of the Red Ape is an enclosure for [[oriental small-clawed otter]]s. The zoos [[Sumatran orangutan|Sumatran Orang-utan]]s were relocated from Realm of the Red Ape to a new exhibit in the Islands development during January 2016.\n\n===The Chimpanzee Breeding Centre===\n[[File:Chimpanzees Chester Zoo.jpg|thumb|A chimpanzee group]]\nThis pavilion was opened in 1989 by [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana, Princess of Wales and Countess of Chester]], and is home to 26 [[Western chimpanzee]]s. This is the largest colony of chimps in Europe, housed in the Roundhouse, a conical indoor enclosure linked to an outside moated island. The island is planted with many bushes and has large poles for the chimps to climb on. The inside area has a climbing frame that allows the chimps to stay close together on several levels of platform. There are seven interconnected off-show dens.\n\n[[File:Aa 2006 05 10 okapis.jpg|right|thumb|The two [[okapi]]s at the zoo]]\n\n===Tsavo Black Rhino Reserve===\nThe zoo's [[black rhinoceros]] exhibit, modelled on the [[Tsavo West National Park|Tsavo National Park]] in Kenya, was opened in 2003 at a cost of [[GBP]]2 million. The zoo has a successful breeding programme for the Eastern Black Rhino and has successfully bred 8 calves between 2008 and 2018. [[Meerkat]]s and [[cape porcupine]]s are kept in a co-inhabited enclosure nearby, and a nearby paddock is home to [[warthog]]s.\n\n===The Wetlands and Tsavo Bird Safari===\n''The Wetlands'' features a large African [[Wetland]] Aviary alongside Tsavo and is home to [[Black Stork]]s, [[Black Crowned Crane]]s, [[Baer's Pochard]]s, [[White-headed duck]]s, [[White-Faced Whistling Duck]]s and other waterfowl. In 2009, a walk-through bird safari with African bird species opened. It currently houses [[von der decken's hornbill]]s, [[lilac-breasted roller]]s, [[hamerkop]]s, [[weaver bird]]s, [[Blacksmith plover]]s, [[Red-winged starling]]s and a variety of waterfowl, amongst other species. At the other side of the Bird Safari is a Large pen for [[wattled crane]]s and Black crowned cranes.\n\n===Fruit Bat Forest===\n''Fruit Bat Forest'' is the largest free-flying [[bat]] cave in Europe. The cave holds two species of bat: [[Rodrigues fruit bat]]s, and [[Seba's short-tailed bat]]s. It is also home to a varied collection of other species including, [[common tenrec]]s and [[blind cave fish]].\n\n===Monkey Islands===\n'''Monkey Islands''' was opened in 1997, replacing the old monkey house, and is currently home to four monkey species: [[Colombian spider monkey|Colombian black spider monkeys]], [[mandrill]]s, [[lion-tailed macaque]]s and [[Golden-bellied capuchin|Buffy-headed capuchin]]s. [[Campbell's mona monkey|Campbell's guenon]]s and [[porcupine]]s were formerly housed with the mandrills, and [[Celebes crested macaque|Sulawesi crested macaque]]s were kept here until they moved to 'Islands' in 2015. Visitors enter the monkey house and view the animals from a central corridor. Each species has a glass-fronted indoor enclosure with climbing apparatus and an outdoor enclosure, moated and heavily planted.\n\n===Miniature Monkeys===\n'''Miniature Monkeys''', opened in May 2004, consists of two enclosures. The first is home to a pair of [[pied tamarin]]s with [[pygmy marmoset]]s, and the second is shared by three [[emperor tamarin]]s and three [[golden-headed lion tamarin]]s. [[Azara's agouti]]s, [[Geoffrey's marmoset]]s, [[black-tailed marmoset]]s, [[black lion tamarin]]s, [[Coppery Titi|Red Titi]] and [[white-faced saki]]s have also been housed here in the past but have been moved out for various reasons.\n\n===Bears of the Cloud Forest===\n'''Bears of the Cloud Forest''' opened in 2004 and is home to a pair of [[spectacled bear]]s and other South American animals. The purpose-built exhibit is designed to mimic the bear's natural habitat by providing trees and a rocky terrain. Nearby are paddocks housing [[capybara]]s, [[Giant anteater]] and [[South American Tapir|Brazilian tapir]]s.\n\n[[Guanaco]] and [[Vicuna]] were previously housed with [[Rhea (bird)|Rhea]].\nThe zoo's first spectacled bear cub was born in January 2017.\n\n===Secret World of the Okapi===\nFormerly the camel house, this enclosure adjoining the giraffe house was remodelled in 2006 to house [[okapi]]. Initially two males were kept: Dicky arrived from [[Marwell Wildlife]] in 2005 and Mbuti came from [[Bristol Zoo]] in the same year. In 2006 Dicky left for [[London Zoo]] to make way for a female named Stuma from Germany. In 2009 Mbuti and Dicky were swapped back, with Mbuti going to London Zoo and Dicky coming back to Chester. Other animals that can be seen here include [[Red forest duiker]]s, [[butterfly barb]]s, and [[short-eared elephant shrew]]s. [[Spiny mouse|Mount Kulal spiny mice]] and [[Rhabdomys|Mesic four-striped grass mice]] have also been kept here in the past along with various other small species. The Okapi bred for the first time in 2012, producing a female calf named Tafari. Two further Okapi calves were born in 2014 and 2018 respectively\n\n[[File:fountain chester zoo.jpg|right|thumb|The fountain and gardens in front of ''Islands in Danger'']]\n\n===Dragons in Danger===\nThis exhibit is primarily a [[herpetarium]] for the zoo's [[Komodo dragon]] It was opened in 1998 and extended in 2003 to include an outdoor enclosure used by the dragons in the warmer summer months. The exhibit is built on the site of the zoo's former bird house. In 2007, several young baby Komodo dragons were put on display after one of the zoo's two females laid eggs which hatched although the female had not been mated; this is [[parthenogenesis]], the first such case recorded in this species.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6196225.stm |title='Virgin births' for giant lizards |work=BBC News |date=20 December 2006 |accessdate=20 June 2008}}</ref> The exhibit was revamped in 2009 to house [[Iguana|Caribbean iguana]]s in one section of the building. It now currently houses [[Spiny turtle|spiny-hill turtle]]s, [[golden coin turtle]]s, and [[Indochinese box turtle]]s in one side and the critically endangered [[Leptodactylus fallax|Mountain chicken frog]]s with some [[Caribbean hermit crab]]s in the other.\n\n'''Dragons in Danger''' also houses various Indonesian and [[Philippine]] rainforest birds, such as [[Palawan peacock-pheasant]]s, [[pheasant pigeon]]s, [[Montserrat oriole]]s and [[Visayan tarictic hornbill]]s. Recently added was a pair of [[Philippine mouse deer]] which have successfully bred. Also housed here are [[Angonoka tortoise|Ploughshare tortoise]]s, [[collared iguana]]s and [[Cyrtopholis|Montserrat Tarantula]]s which Chester bred in 2016 for the first time in captivity. Species formerly kept in the exhibit include [[Socorro dove]]s, [[Mindanao bleeding-heart]]s, [[Papuan lorikeet]]s and [[Saint Lucia amazon|Saint Lucia parrot]]s.\n\n===Mongoose Mania===\nLocated near the former tiger enclosure, this area used to be a petting farm, but was closed due to an outbreak of [[foot-and-mouth disease]]. The petting farm is now a picnic lawn and a former [[kune kune pig]] enclosure has been demolished in favour of a food stall.\n\n'''Mongoose Mania''', which houses [[Common dwarf mongoose|dwarf mongoose]]s features tunnels beneath the enclosure which allow children to crawl through, popping up their heads into plastic domes to give them a mongoose's eye view of the world.\n\n===Giant otters and penguins===\nIn early 2010, the [[Californian sea lion]]s left the collection. Over the late winter the pool was converted to house a new species to the zoo. The [[giant otter]]s went on show for the first time on 26 March 2010. The zoo bred their first pups in 2013.\n\nIn the neighbouring enclosure, a large breeding group of over 50 [[Humboldt penguin]]s have their own pool, and visitors can watch the birds from an underwater viewing window.\n\n===Tropical Realm===\nChester's '''Tropical Realm''' is Britain's largest tropical house at over 26,000 cubic metres. Opened in 1964, most of the interior is an open-plan space extending to roof level and themed with pools and mature tropical plants, with pathways for visitors through the undergrowth. Here, more than 30 species of birds are free-flying, including [[Nicobar pigeon]]s, various species of [[starling]]s and ground birds such as [[crested partridge]]s.\n\nAviaries and vivaria are arranged around the sides of the building; those on the upper level were originally designed for [[birds of paradise]] and the [[hornbill]] aviaries were originally made for [[gorilla]]s. The aviaries currently house birds such as [[great Indian hornbill]]s, [[rhinoceros hornbill]]s, two pairs of [[tarictic hornbill]] (one pure-bred and one hybrid), [[writhed-billed hornbill]]s, [[red-crested turaco]]s, [[Palawan peacock-pheasant]]s, [[Congo peafowl]], [[Bali starling]]s, [[Western crowned pigeon|blue-crowned pigeon]]s, [[fairy-bluebird]]s, [[white-rumped shama]], [[white-crested turaco]]s, [[Snowy-crowned robin-chat]]s, [[Mindanao bleeding-heart]]s [[Green aracari]] and [[Luzon Scops Owl]]s. At the entrance is an aviary for [[Sumatran laughingthrush]]es and [[grey-winged blackbird]].\n\nThe Tropical Realm is also the centre of the reptile collection. The [[crocodile]] pools (which formerly housed [[Dwarf crocodile|West African dwarf crocodiles]], [[American alligator]]s and [[Philippine crocodile]]s) currently house [[spectacled caiman]]s in one and [[white-winged wood duck]]s and a [[yellow-faced myna]] in the other. Near the entrance is an enclosure for [[tuatara]]s. This lizard-like species from New Zealand is the last surviving [[Sphenodontia|sphenodont]], a prehistoric group of reptiles, and Chester is the only British zoo to exhibit them. In February 2016, a tuatara hatched for the first time outside of New Zealand, leading Chester Zoo to be the only zoo to have bred them anywhere else. There were many varieties of snakes and lizards in the past (many had to depart as a result) ; [[emerald tree boa]]s and [[Orthriophis moellendorffi|Moellendorf's ratsnake]]s now being the only remaining. The lizard collection is now made up of [[Laemanctus|Serrated casquehead iguana]]s, [[Graham's anole]]s, [[Dracaena (lizard)|caiman lizard]]s, and a [[Parson's chameleon]].\n\n[[Tortoise]]s are represented by [[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise|Gal\u00e1pagos]] and [[radiated tortoise|radiated]]. Amphibians include [[Poison dart frog]]s, [[Golden mantella]]s, [[Blue-legged mantella]]s, a [[typhlonectes natans|Rio Cauca caecilian]], [[Borneo eared frog]]s and [[Morelet's Tree Frog]]s.\n\nThere is also a pair of [[Philippine mouse-deer]] near the poison dart frogs.\n\nIn the Winter of 2015/2016 the former [[Golden-bellied capuchin|Yellow Breasted Capuchin]] exhibit at the rear of Tropical Realm was converted to house a pair of [[Aye-Aye]] and a group of [[Malagasy giant rat|Malagasy Giant Jumping Rat]]s.\n\n===European Aviary===\nThis aviary was formerly home to [[Andean condor]]s but is now the home to a variety of European birds after '''Europe on the Edge''' was demolished in late 2017. The species include here consist of [[European black vulture]]s, (being the zoo's last birds of prey). There are also [[Eurasian spoonbill]]s, [[northern bald ibis]]es and [[little egret]]s as well as a selection of [[waterfowl]]. Smaller birds include [[rock dove]]s, [[azure-winged magpie]]s and the native but rare [[red-billed chough]].\n\n[[File:Vulture Chester Zoo.jpg|thumb|A vulture at the zoo]]\n\n===Rare Parrot Breeding Centre===\n[[File:Ara glaucogularis -Chester Zoo -upper body-8b.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blue-throated macaw]].]]\n{{commons category|Ara glaucogularis in Chester Zoo}}\nParrots on display here include [[red-vented cockatoo]]s, [[lesser sulphur-crested cockatoo]]s, [[Red-and-blue lory|red-and-blue lories]], [[Chattering lory|yellow-backed chattering lories]], [[Mindanao lorikeet|Mount Apo lorikeet]]s and [[blue-and-yellow macaw]]s. The only ones on show are [[Ecuador Amazon]]s. Most of the birds were moved to the '''Rare Parrot Breeding Centre''' from the old parrot house when it was demolished in 2005 to make way for Realm of the Red Ape.\n\n===Magnificent Macaws===\nThis exhibit consists of two aviaries housing rare and endangered South American parrots and macaws. These include [[hyacinth macaw]]s, in the aviary outside the Tropical Realm and [[Blue-throated macaw]]s and an [[Inca jay]] are housed in the other.\n\n===Aquarium===\nThe [[aquarium]] is a small and traditional building (one of the oldest at the zoo, built by George Mottershead's daughter and son-in-law in the 1950s) housing a varied collection of freshwater and marine fish, aquatic invertebrates and amphibians. It has had notable success breeding [[seahorse]]s and achieved the first captive breeding of the [[Potamotrygon|freshwater motoro stingray]].\n\nOther notable fish include [[Paretroplus menarambo|Pinstripe Damba]]s, [[Mudskipper]]s, tropical reef fish and various [[Lake Malawi]] [[cichlid]]s. Invertebrates such as [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s and several species of [[coral]] and [[shrimp]]s are housed with the fish.\n\n===Asian Plains and paddocks===\n[[File:Aa chesterzoo scimitarhornedoryx 00.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scimitar-horned oryx]]es]]\n[[Image:Aa chesterzoo sitatunga 00.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sitatunga]]s]]\nIn 2008, '''Asian Plains''' received its official opening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chesterzoo.org/Home/News/May%202008/American%20Entrepreneur%20opens%20the%20Asian%20Plains%20exhibit.aspx |title=Marc Ecko opens Asian Plains exhibit |publisher=www.chesterzoo.org |accessdate=20 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704154946/http://www.chesterzoo.org/Home/News/May%202008/American%20Entrepreneur%20opens%20the%20Asian%20Plains%20exhibit.aspx |archive-date=4 July 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Based around a mixed-species paddock featuring [[Eld's deer|Burmese brow-antlered deer]], the exhibit has recently been extended to include new enclosures for [[Indian rhinoceros|greater one-horned rhinoceros]] and [[cheetah]].\nThe male rhino was joined by a female in 2008 to form a pair which the zoo hoped would breed. Sadly in November 2009 the male Indian rhino \"Patna\" was put down due to a longstanding leg injury. The zoo obtained a replacement male from [[Edinburgh Zoo]] in March 2010. Since they were closely related the previous female departed for a zoo in Spain shortly after, and the zoo are in the progress of creating a breeding situation&nbsp;\u2013 Baabu has now been exchanged for 'Beni' from Pilsen Zoo. 2 Indian rhino calves have been born on the plain, the most recent, a male was born May 2018. The paddocks formerly housed [[barasingha]], [[Ankole cattle]], [[blackbuck]] and [[sitatunga]].\n\nOther paddocks on the west side of the zoo support grazing herds of [[Gr\u00e9vy's zebra]]s, [[sitatunga]], [[Kirk's dik-dik]]s, [[eastern bongo]], and [[roan antelope]].\n\n[[Przewalski's horse]]s left the collection in 2009 to make way for the new [[African wild dog|African hunting dog]] enclosure. Other animals formerly housed here were [[P\u00e8re David's deer]], [[red-necked wallaby|red-necked wallabies]], [[ostrich]]es and [[emu]]s.\n\n===Mkomazi National Park Painted Dogs Conserve===\nIn 2011, a new exhibit housing [[African painted dog]]s on the site of the former [[Przewalski's horse]] paddock was opened. In the style of an African Research Station with an African Village, the exhibit has a dry landscape with fake [[kopje]] stones. A pack of four [[African painted dog]]s are the main exhibit and the first breeding occurred in 2018.  [[Aardvark]]s and [[rock hyrax]]es are nearby.\n\n===Forest Zone===\nThe north east area of the zoo is where many forest-dwelling species are kept. As well as the [[chimpanzee]]s, [[okapi]]s, [[jaguar]]s and Tropical Realm, there are enclosures for [[African forest buffalo|Congo buffalo]], [[red river hog]]s and [[Lowland anoa]]. Nearby is a large paddock and house for the zoo's [[Rothschild's giraffe]] herd. The area between the rear of Tropical Realm and the Spirit of the Jaguar has enclosures for various species including a group of native [[sand lizard]]s, and an aviary for [[red-knobbed curassow|red-billed curassow]]s.\n\nAnimals formerly displayed in forest zone include [[maned wolf|maned wolves]], [[babirusa]], [[warthog]]s, Chilean [[pud\u00fa]], [[Mallorcan midwife toad]]s, [[golden-bellied capuchin]]s, [[visayan warty pig]]s, [[ring-tailed coati]]s and [[bactrian camel]]s.\n\n===Butterfly Journey===\nAn enclosure formerly housing [[maned wolf|maned wolves]] was demolished and replaced in 2008 by a heated [[butterfly]] house called '''Butterfly Journey''', which is based around the life cycle of a butterfly, featuring free-flying butterflies and [[moth]]s (The exotic species on show include [[Morpho peleides|blue morpho]]s, [[Caligo idomeneus|giant owl]]s, [[Greta oto|glasswing]]s, [[Swallowtail butterfly|swallowtail]]s and [[Atlas moth]]s), a cabinet of [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]s, and an area with [[caterpillar]]s. Also featured in this exhibit is an area for a variety of different invertebrates and a mesh enclosure for some [[panther chameleon]]s.\n\n===Big cats===\n[[File:Sumatran tiger Chester Zoo.jpg|thumb|A sumatran tiger at Chester Zoo]]\nAs well as [[jaguar]]s, Chester Zoo keeps [[lions]], [[tiger]]s and [[cheetah]]s<ref name=cheetah>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrexhamleader.co.uk/news/Bank-holiday-is-a-record.4072518.jp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122053612/http://www.wrexhamleader.co.uk/news/Bank-holiday-is-a-record.4072518.jp |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 November 2008 |title=Bank Holiday is a record |publisher=Wrexham Leader |date=12 May 2008 |accessdate=18 June 2008 }}</ref> in its [[big cat]] collection. The lions are the [[Asiatic lion|Asiatic subspecies]] found only in the [[Gir Forest]] in India in the wild. The zoo's former resident male Asoka was joined by a female, Asha, from Rome in 2006. The pair have bred on three occasions, but so far their only offspring to survive has been a male cub, Tejas, born and hand-reared in 2007. His upbringing was featured prominently in the first series of ''[[Chester Zoo#Television documentary|Zoo Days]]''. Tejas left Chester Zoo for [[Besancon]] early in 2008 as part of the European breeding programme for this subspecies. Asoka left the zoo in early 2010, he was moved to [[Rome Zoo]] as part of the European breeding programme. His replacement is 3-year-old Iblis, who arrived from Planckendael Zoo in [[Belgium]]. In late summer 2011, Asha retired to Santillana Zoo and was replaced by four-year females Kiburi and Kumari.\n\nIn 2007, a male [[Sumatran tiger]] called Kepala arrived from [[Dudley Zoo]] to join the two resident female [[Bengal tiger]]s, who left in 2008. The same year, the zoo acquired a female tiger named Kirana, but unfortunately it was discovered that the pair were related. Kepala departed to [[Dublin Zoo]] and a new male named Fabi was brought in from Prague Zoo to form a breeding pair of Sumatrans, a critically endangered subspecies in the wild.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/15966/summ\n|title=Sumatran Tiger\n|work=iucnredlist.org\n|publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]]\n|accessdate=5 March 2008\n}}</ref> Kirana and Fabi bred and have so far bred successfully on three occasions since 2011.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n|url=http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16115518\n|title=Sumatran Tiger Cubs Emerge From Their Den\n|work=sky.com\n|publisher=BskyB\n|accessdate=23 November 2011\n}}</ref>\n\nThe zoo welcomed its first ever cheetah cubs in June 2011. The cheetahs are the vulnerable [[Sudan cheetah|Sudanese subspecies]] - a second litter was born in 2013\n\n===Asian Steppe===\n[[Bactrian camel]]s and [[onager]]s in a large paddock in the centre of the zoo, formerly the zebra exhibit. A paddock which was only visible from the monorail but can now be seen from the Bats' Bridge holds a group of [[Philippine spotted deer]].\n\n===Other exhibits===\n[[File:Aa chesterzoo bluecranes 00.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blue crane]]s]]\n[[File:Aa chesterozoo flamingos 00.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flamingo]]s]]\n\nBordering the paddocks is a waterway running north-south, along which the water bus formerly traveled, past island groups of [[white-faced saki]]s, [[Lac Alaotra bamboo lemur|Alaotran bamboo lemur]]s and [[howler monkey]]s. A variety of callitrichids, including [[cotton-top tamarin]]s, were formerly housed on the Bamboo Lemur Island, and the howler monkey and white-faced saki exhibits were formerly home to [[black-and-white ruffed lemur]]s and [[red ruffed lemur]]s. A nearby island viewable from Bats Bridge has previously held [[lowland anoa]] and is now holding [[babirusa]].\nIn the southeast corner of the zoo are enclosures housing assorted animals including [[bush dog]]s, [[red panda]]s, [[southern pudu]], [[Azara's agouti]], [[Red-billed blue magpie]]s and the wetland bird nursery. The former cassowary exhibit next to the pademelons is now home to [[Pallas's Cat]]s.\n\nNear the Rare Parrot Breeding Centre is a group of aviaries currently housing the zoo's owl collection. This includes: [[spectacled owl]]s, [[great grey owl]]s, [[northern hawk owl]]s, [[brown wood owl]]s, [[southern white-faced owl]]s and [[ural owl]]s. The owl aviaries were recently modified.\n\nAlongside the Arara lawn is a set of recently refurbished aviaries that house various species of Asian songbirds and pheasants.\n\nFlocks of [[Chilean flamingo|Chilean]] and [[American flamingo|Caribbean]] flamingos live in shallow water alongside a large island housing a group of [[ring-tailed lemur]]s and a pair of [[black and white ruffed lemur]]s. The lemurs are to be moved to a new Madagascar themed walk through enclosure in 2018 along with [[Fossa (animal)|Fossa]]. New indoor accommodation for the flamingos was completed in 2007.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012 there was a display of [[animatronic]] dinosaurs: ''[[Triceratops]]'', ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' and its eggs and hatchlings, ''[[Dilophosaurus]]'' (which squirts water from its mouth), ''[[Allosaurus]]'', ''[[Rugops]]'', ''[[Omeisaurus]]'', ''[[Apatosaurus]]'', ''[[Baryonyx]]'', ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', ''[[Tyrannosaurus]] rex''. A second exhibition was made in 2012 with other anamatronic dinosaurs featuring: a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', a ''[[Dilophosaurus]]'' and young (which both spit water), a ''[[Megalosaurus]]'', a ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' and hatchlings, a ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', a ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'',\nan ''[[Edmontonia]]'', a ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'', two ''[[Coelophysis]]'', a ''[[Parasaurolophus]]'', a ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and a ''[[Tyranosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' and young.\n\n==Membership and adoption==\nThe zoo has a service that gives people the option of adopting an animal of their choice, they are also given two complimentary tickets to allow them to visit the animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chesterzoo.org/support-us/adoptions|title=Animal Adoption - Adopting Animals - Chester Zoo|website=www.chesterzoo.org|accessdate=16 December 2018}}</ref> They can also become members which allows them to visit Chester and a range of other zoos across England free of charge for a year.

The 3' UTR has a conserved RNA [[Nucleic acid secondary structure|secondary structure]] but different Coronavirus genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronaviruses) have different structural features described below.\n\n== Alphacoronavirus 3' UTR ==\nThe 3' UTR of [[Alphacoronavirus|Alphacoronaviruses]] consists of two small hairpins ('''PK-SL2''') which can form an alternate conformation ('''PK-SL1''') where the loop region of the second hairpin interacts with the stem of the first hairpin (see [[Coronavirus 3' UTR pseudoknot]]). PK-SL2 has been confirmed in [[Human coronavirus 229E|HCoV-229E]] and [[Human coronavirus NL63|HCoV-NL63]] by in vitro structure probing experiments. Downstream of this pseudoknot lies the '''hypervariable region''' (HVR), which is supported by many covarying base pairs in alphacoronaviruses. Further, a conserved octanucleotide sequence <code>5'-GGAAGAGC-3'</code> is present in the HVR. \n\n== Betacoronavirus 3' UTR ==\nThe 3' UTR of [[Betacoronavirus|Betacoronaviruses]] is approximately 300-500 nucleotides long. The most 5' structure is the '''bulged stem-loop''' (BSL), starting downstream of the N gene [[stop codon]] and is essential for viral replication. It is predicted to be conserved among Betacoronaviruses. Downstream to the BSL lies the '''hypervariable bulged-stemloop region''' (HVR), containing a triple helix junction. The hairpin stem-loop arising from this junction participates in the pseudoknot pairing with the BSL region. The pseudoknot and the BSL partially overlap and therefore cannot be formed at the same time. It is proposed that the BSL and pseudoknot act as a molecular switch that may regulate a transition during viral RNA synthesis. Part of the HVR is the octanucleotide sequence <code>5'-GGAAGAGC-3'</code> which is conserved among Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses. The 3' UTR of [[SARS-CoV-2]] is similar to other Betacoronaviruses and is approximately 300-500 nucleotides long. \n\n== Gammacoronavirus 3' UTR ==\nIn [[Gammacoronavirus|Gammacoronaviruses]] a stem-loop located at the 3' UTR is observed, which is vital for viral replication. Even though a nearby pseudoknot structure, which has been observed in other genera of coronaviruses, is present, its functional importance has not been established yet.\n\n== Deltacoronavirus 3' UTR ==\nThere are two smaller hairpins and the hypervariable region (HVR) present in the 3' UTR of [[Deltacoronavirus|Deltacoronaviruses]]. The pseudoknot structure which is typical for Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses has not been predicted in Deltacoronaviruses so far.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Coronavirus 5' UTR]]\n* [[Coronavirus 3' UTR pseudoknot]]\n*[[Coronavirus 3' stem-loop II-like motif (s2m)]]\n*[[Coronavirus frameshifting stimulation element]]\n*[[Coronavirus packaging signal]]\n{{Navbox|name=hide the gallery|title=Gallery of Coronavirus|titlestyle=background:#e7dcc3|state=autocollapse|list1\u00a0={{Gallery\n\n| lines=5\n\n| Image:RF03121.svg|'''aCoV-3UTR''' Secondary structure taken from the [http://rfam.org Rfam] database.
