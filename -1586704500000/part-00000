On the way, Krishna encounters a mysterious woman who attempts to give him an important message. But Krishna warns the woman to leave him alone, and runs away. Krishna finally arrives and meets Ramesh, who runs a small liquor business. Although the money he earns is able to fulfill his basic needs to eat and survive, he's not satisfied. He says that life is not easy as he had thought. Krishna says that although there is money in [[Malaysia]], there is also hard work and suggests Ramesh to send his liquor to town to sell for more profit. Ramesh tells Krishna that he's going to a neighboring village Marpha and Krishna tags along to meet Amo (his aunt).\n \nOn their way to [[Marpha]], they stop at a cave for the night. So, they had [[Apple|apple slices]] and talking about Malaysia, [[job]], [[money]], [[business]] and [[marriage]]. Then suddenly, a strange hermit appears shortly; he feels very cold; so his [[Abdomen|tummy]] and his [[Navel|belly button]] are hurting. The strange hermit was wearing a [[turban]], [[Paint|white paint]] on his [[forehead]], [[Necklace|monkey necklace]], long scarf, [[Ring (jewellery)|ring]], [[bracelet]] [[Skirt|long skirt]] and his bag; then he walks in [[barefoot]]. Krishna hands him the [[blanket]] that he's brought from Malaysia for Amo and asks to come near [[Firewood|fire]]. In return, the hermit hands him a monkey's paw, which he claims to be magical. The hermit explains that the paw can fulfill the owner's wish but can bring a great disaster if anyone other than its owner uses it. If they don't, there will be consequences. So, they went to sleep; and the hermit wore the blanket to feel nice and warm. The hermit opens his [[Rib cage|ribcage]]; from his [[Abdomen|tummy]] and the following morning, the hermit dissappears.  \n\nThey finish their business in Marpha and return. While returning, they come across an inn where they meet Pema (Pooja Gurung) and drink for a while. Krishna flirts with the girl. He also talks about marriage and that he's got a photo of the girl with whom his parents are talking for his marriage. Pema tells them that the girl in the photo is Tara (Deeya Maskey) and that she knows her and that someone else also wants to marry her. When Ramesh sees her photo, he frowns for he is the guy who wants to marry her. He is distressed and doesn't talk much.\n\nThat night, they do not move ahead. Ramesh wakes up in the middle of the night, takes the paw from Krishna and makes a wish to get Tara, not realizing it's consequence. Then, the mysterious girl feel upset and scared. \n\nWhile getting back, Ramesh doesn't talk much. Sometime later, as Krishna takes the monkey's paw in his hand, he loses his balance because the mules tremble when they see it. He falls off the hill in spite of Ramesh's efforts to save him with a rope. Then, the monkey's paw falls off the hill; and the hermit will turn into a [[skeleton]] and [[Death|die]].\n\nThe story then moves 9 years later. Ramesh is married now with Tara and has got a son Bardaan (Vivek Gurung). Their business has grown up. One day, Ramesh is offered a contract by a trader from the town. He demands 5000 bottles of liquor in three months. In return, he assures Rs. 1,37,000 in advance. Tara insists to hire two three guys for the work, but he tells her that he's going to buy an apple crusher from town.\n\nRamesh brings machine from town, teaches Tara to use it and crushes apples and is able to make some 500 bottles in two and a half months. One day as they are ready to sleep, Tara tells Ramesh that there is some friend to see Ramesh. Ramesh is surprised to see Krishna. Krishna tells him that he survived unlike everyone thought.\n\nKrishna asks Tara to get a cigarette and a lighter from his bag, but she is scared to find a monkey's paw when she takes the cigarette out. Ramesh is amazed to see the paw still with him. He explains to Tara that the paw had power to fulfill one's wish. Meanwhile, Tara's watch stops running.\n\nThat night, Ramesh remembers everything again, about a [[watch]], monkey's paw, hermit, picture of Tara, wish and Krishna's death; and the next day, they are amazed to see Krishna not in his room. The main door is locked from inside. While sweeping the floor, she finds the paw under the bed and keeps it with her.\n\nThat night, there is a [[Storm|big storm]] and [[Rain|heavy rainfall]] that causes all the [[Apple|apples]] in his field and the whole village to fall down before ripening. So, he worries that he won't be able to make the remaining liquors as per the deal. When the trader comes back, he asks him one month time for the remaining [[Bottle|bottles]], but the trader gives him only two weeks and tells him that he'd have to return the money given in advance if he can't make it.\n\nSeeing the deteriorating situation at home, Tara makes a wish to solve the problem. The next day, their son Bardaan is run over by a [[tractor]] and [[Death|dies]]. Both Ramesh and Tara are very much saddened by the incident. However, they get 1,50,000 as a compensation from the owner of the tractor. Ramesh is able to give the trader all the money he owes through this, but the trader denies taking the interest feeling sorry about the death of their son. One day, while going to bed, Tara tells Ramesh that the paw works as she'd wished to solve the problem. She cries and demands her son back. Ramesh fights with her not to use the paw again, but she makes a wish to return their son. Suddenly, there is a tap on the door. But Ramesh struggles to get the paw from her and wishes they don't want their son back. When Tara opens the door, there is no one.\n\nAs Ramesh decides to get rid of the paw forever, he makes one final wish that he'll never use it again. The paw is picked up by Bardaan, who disappears with a flash.\n\nThe mysterious woman now walks somewhere as if her mission has been accomplished.\n\n==Production ==\n\nThe filmmakers brought high-definition digital cameras from [[Silicon Imaging]], an American company that was just starting out. The cast and crew set off to [[Jomsom]] in October 2006 and shot for thirty days non-stop in [[Kagbeni, Mustang|Kagbeni]], [[Jomsom]], [[Marpha]], and Shyang in [[Mustang district]] of Nepal.\n\nThe camera is as big as a CCTV and does not use tapes for recording. Instead, it saves everything on a hard disk and has inferior image quality compared to film.

Although the cinema halls didn't see the response as was expected, it started off really good with a new director and actors. Bhusan Dahal was a music video director and this was his debut film. Saugat Malla and Deeya Maskey are well-known theatre actors. Nima Rumba is a popular Nepali singer. The movie was also hyped for its sizzling kissing scene between the two lead actors.\n\nAfter Kagbeni, there have been some new movies of the same quality. ''[[Sano Sansar (film)|Sano Sansar]]'' by music video director Alok Nembang is based on youths in the city and ''Mission Paisa'' is an action movie. ''Dasdhunga'', an investigation-based movie on the mysterious death of Madan Bhandari and Jiv Raj Ashrit in 2050 BS, and ''13246'', a documentary-cum-movie on the decade-long Maoist conflict in Nepal, followed the trend set by Kagbeni. Dasdhunga was directed by Manoj Pandit and 13246 by Apil Bista.\n\n==Box office==\n\nThe film was released in Nepal on 10 January 2008. The film got a phenomenal response in the urban areas like [[Kathmandu]], [[Pokhara]], Narayangarh, etc. while the rural areas had decent collections. The movie collected Rs 40 lacs in its opening week, thus creating a new history in the Nepali cinema industry. The film grossed about Rs 3 crores from its theatrical run.

The name of the movie is taken from a tourist place [[Kagbeni, Mustang|Kagbeni]] situated in the valley of the Kali Gandaki, which is a 2-hour side trek from [[Muktinath]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kagbeni.com.np/ |title=Kagbeni {{!}} Kagbeni Movie {{!}} Official Site<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312030058/http://www.kagbeni.com.np/ |archive-date=2008-03-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=September 2008}}\nThe story begins with Krishna ([[Nima Rumba]]) returning from Malaysia to a village to meet Ramesh ([[Saugat Malla]]) and Bishnu (Hanif Mohammed) who have been his childhood friends. On the way, Krishna encounters a mysterious woman who attempts to give him an important message. But Krishna warns the woman to leave him alone, and runs away. Krishna finally arrives and meets Ramesh, who runs a small liquor business. Although the money he earns is able to fulfill his basic needs to eat and survive, he's not satisfied. He says that life is not easy as he had thought. Krishna says that although there is money in [[Malaysia]], there is also hard work and suggests Ramesh to send his liquor to town to sell for more profit. Ramesh tells Krishna that he's going to a neighboring village Marpha and Krishna tags along to meet Amo (his aunt).\n \nOn their way to [[Marpha]], they stop at a cave for the night. So, they had [[Apple|apple slices]] and talking about Malaysia, [[job]], [[money]], [[business]] and [[marriage]]. Then suddenly, a strange hermit appears shortly; he feels very cold; so his [[Abdomen|tummy]] and his [[Navel|belly button]] are hurting. The strange hermit was wearing a [[turban]], [[Paint|white paint]] on his [[forehead]], [[Necklace|monkey necklace]], long scarf, [[ring]], [[bracelet]] [[Skirt|long skirt]] and his bag; then he walks in [[barefoot]]. Krishna hands him the [[blanket]] that he's brought from Malaysia for Amo and asks to come near [[Firewood|fire]]. In return, the hermit hands him a monkey's paw, which he claims to be magical. The hermit explains that the paw can fulfill the owner's wish but can bring a great disaster if anyone other than its owner uses it. If they don't, there will be consequences. So, they went to sleep; and the hermit wore the blanket to feel nice and warm. The hermit opens his [[Rib cage|ribcage]]; from his [[Abdomen|tummy]] and the following morning, the hermit dissappears.  \n\nThey finish their business in Marpha and return. While returning, they come across an inn where they meet Pema (Pooja Gurung) and drink for a while. Krishna flirts with the girl. He also talks about marriage and that he's got a photo of the girl with whom his parents are talking for his marriage. Pema tells them that the girl in the photo is Tara (Deeya Maskey) and that she knows her and that someone else also wants to marry her. When Ramesh sees her photo, he frowns for he is the guy who wants to marry her. He is distressed and doesn't talk much.\n\nThat night, they do not move ahead. Ramesh wakes up in the middle of the night, takes the paw from Krishna and makes a wish to get Tara, not realizing it's consequence. Then, the mysterious girl feel upset and scared. \n\nWhile getting back, Ramesh doesn't talk much. Sometime later, as Krishna takes the monkey's paw in his hand, he loses his balance because the mules tremble when they see it. He falls off the hill in spite of Ramesh's efforts to save him with a rope. Then, the monkey's paw falls off the hill; and the hermit will turn into a [[skeleton]] and [[Death|die]].\n\nThe story then moves 9 years later. Ramesh is married now with Tara and has got a son Bardaan (Vivek Gurung). Their business has grown up. One day, Ramesh is offered a contract by a trader from the town. He demands 5000 bottles of liquor in three months. In return, he assures Rs. 1,37,000 in advance. Tara insists to hire two three guys for the work, but he tells her that he's going to buy an apple crusher from town.\n\nRamesh brings machine from town, teaches Tara to use it and crushes apples and is able to make some 500 bottles in two and a half months. One day as they are ready to sleep, Tara tells Ramesh that there is some friend to see Ramesh. Ramesh is surprised to see Krishna. Krishna tells him that he survived unlike everyone thought.\n\nKrishna asks Tara to get a cigarette and a lighter from his bag, but she is scared to find a monkey's paw when she takes the cigarette out. Ramesh is amazed to see the paw still with him. He explains to Tara that the paw had power to fulfill one's wish. Meanwhile, Tara's watch stops running.\n\nThat night, Ramesh remembers everything again, about a [[watch]], monkey's paw, hermit, picture of Tara, wish and Krishna's death; and the next day, they are amazed to see Krishna not in his room. The main door is locked from inside. While sweeping the floor, she finds the paw under the bed and keeps it with her.\n\nThat night, there is a [[Storm|big storm]] and [[Rain|heavy rainfall]] that causes all the [[Apple|apples]] in his field and the whole village to fall down before ripening. So, he worries that he won't be able to make the remaining liquors as per the deal. When the trader comes back, he asks him one month time for the remaining [[Bottle|bottles]], but the trader gives him only two weeks and tells him that he'd have to return the money given in advance if he can't make it.\n\nSeeing the deteriorating situation at home, Tara makes a wish to solve the problem. The next day, their son Bardaan is run over by a [[tractor]] and [[Death|dies]]. Both Ramesh and Tara are very much saddened by the incident. However, they get 1,50,000 as a compensation from the owner of the tractor. Ramesh is able to give the trader all the money he owes through this, but the trader denies taking the interest feeling sorry about the death of their son.

Compatibility is considered higher priority than performance. On the other hand, MinGW's priorities are simplicity and performance. As such, it does not provide certain [[POSIX]] APIs which cannot easily be implemented using the Windows API, such as <code>[[Fork (operating system)|fork()]]</code>, <code>[[mmap|mmap()]]</code> and <code>[[ioctl|ioctl()]]</code>.<ref name=\"differencesCygwinMinGW\" /> Applications written using a [[cross-platform]] library that has itself been ported to MinGW, such as [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]], [[wxWidgets]], [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]], or [[GTK]], will usually compile as easily in MinGW as they would in Cygwin.\n\nWindows programs written with Cygwin run on top of a [[copyleft]]ed compatibility [[Microsoft Dynamic Link Library|DLL]] that must be distributed with the program, along with the program's source code. MinGW does not require a [[compatibility layer]], since MinGW-based programs are compiled with direct calls to Windows APIs.\n\nThe combination of MinGW and MSYS provides a small, self-contained environment that can be loaded onto removable media without leaving entries in the [[Windows Registry|registry]] or files on the computer.\n\nIt is also possible to [[cross compiler|cross-compile]] Windows applications with MinGW-GCC under POSIX systems. This means that developers do not need a Windows installation with MSYS to compile software that will run on Windows with or without Cygwin.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mingw.org/ official website]\n* [http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php mingw-w64]\n* [https://msys2.github.io MSYS2 installer]\n* [https://nuwen.net/mingw.html nuwen 64-bit MinGW distro] - maintained by a [https://nuwen.net/stl.html microsoft employee]\n\n{{Software in the Public Interest}}\n{{Unix-Windows interoperability}}\n\n[[Category:1998 software]]\n[[Category:C compilers]]\n[[Category:C++ compilers]]\n[[Category:Cross-compilers]]\n[[Category:Fortran compilers]]\n[[Category:Free compilers and interpreters]]\n[[Category:Public-domain software]]\n", "text_old": "{{primary sources|date=May 2012}}\n{{Infobox software\n| author                 = Colin Peters\n| developer              = MinGW Project\n| released               = {{Start date and age|1998|07|01}}\n| latest release version = GNU BinUtils\u20142.32-1, Installation Manager\u20140.6.3, WSL\u20145.2.1<ref name=\"paklist\">{{cite web | url=https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/ | title=Download Package list | website=osdn.net}}</ref>\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2019|02|11}}\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date    = \n| status                 = Active<ref>Visit the [https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/ list of releases] and notice their dates.</ref>\n| programming language   = [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]]\n| operating system       = [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Unix-like]] (as a [[cross compiler]])\n| genre                  = [[Compiler]]\n| license                = [[Public domain]] (headers), [[GNU General Public License]] (compiler and toolchain)\n| website                = {{URL|mingw.org}}\n}}\n'''MinGW''' (\"Minimalist GNU for Windows\"), formerly '''mingw32''', is a [[Free and open-source software|free and open source]] [[software development]] environment to create [[Microsoft Windows]] applications.

Compatibility is considered higher priority than performance. On the other hand, MinGW's priorities are simplicity and performance. As such, it does not provide certain [[POSIX]] APIs which cannot easily be implemented using the Windows API, such as <code>[[Fork (operating system)|fork()]]</code>, <code>[[mmap|mmap()]]</code> and <code>[[ioctl|ioctl()]]</code>.<ref name=\"differencesCygwinMinGW\" /> Applications written using a [[cross-platform]] library that has itself been ported to MinGW, such as [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]], [[wxWidgets]], [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]], or [[GTK]], will usually compile as easily in MinGW as they would in Cygwin.\n\nWindows programs written with Cygwin run on top of a [[copyleft]]ed compatibility [[Microsoft Dynamic Link Library|DLL]] that must be distributed with the program, along with the program's source code. MinGW does not require a [[compatibility layer]], since MinGW-based programs are compiled with direct calls to Windows APIs.\n\nThe combination of MinGW and MSYS provides a small, self-contained environment that can be loaded onto removable media without leaving entries in the [[Windows Registry|registry]] or files on the computer.\n\nIt is also possible to [[cross compiler|cross-compile]] Windows applications with MinGW-GCC under POSIX systems. This means that developers do not need a Windows installation with MSYS to compile software that will run on Windows with or without Cygwin.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mingw.org/ official website]\n* [http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php mingw-w64]\n* [https://msys2.github.io MSYS2 installer]\n* [https://nuwen.net/mingw.html nuwen 64-bit MinGW distro] - maintained by a [https://nuwen.net/stl.html microsoft employee]\n\n{{Software in the Public Interest}}\n{{Unix-Windows interoperability}}\n\n[[Category:1998 software]]\n[[Category:C compilers]]\n[[Category:C++ compilers]]\n[[Category:Cross-compilers]]\n[[Category:Fortran compilers]]\n[[Category:Free compilers and interpreters]]\n[[Category:Public-domain software]]\n", "name_user": "Sbmeirow", "label": "safe", "comment": "sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW"}

As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n* Passenger service on the [[Portishead Railway]] stopped in 1964; plans are to reopen it as far as [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], possibly in 2023. Freight services ceased in 1981 (unrelated to Beeching) and resumed on part of the line in 2002.\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.  Previously Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]].

A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009, with a direct train to London that terminates at Corby, with a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}. The [[Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line|line towards Kidderminster and Worcester]] was reopened to Snow Hill in 1995. \n* The line from [[Birmingham Snow Hill \u2013 Wolverhampton Low Level Line|Snow Hill to Wolverhampton]] reopened as the [[Midland Metro]] [[tram]] system.  Despite the successful and potential reopening of many rail routes as light-rail and metro lines, the concept is still under threat due to the varying popularity of these schemes with successive governments.\n* The line from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]] reopened in 1987 after closing in 1968\n* The line from [[Coventry to Nuneaton Line|Coventry to Nuneaton]] reopened to passengers in 1988. \n* The line from [[Coventry to Leamington line]] reopened to passengers in 1977 and the station at [[Kenilworth railway station|Kenilworth]] reopened on 30 April 2018.\n* The [[Chase Line|Walsall\u2013Hednesford line]] reopened to passengers in 1989, and was extended to [[Rugeley Town railway station|Rugeley]] in 1997. Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[South Staffordshire Line]] between Stourbridge and Walsall is set to reopen as a part of the Midland Metro expansion scheme. The line will be shared between trams and freight trains.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n\n===North West===\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced in 1992 serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan (opened 2007), Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened. This was the 77th new or reopened station in Scotland since 1970. Others include {{Stnlnk|Auchinleck}}, {{Stnlnk|Gretna Green}}, {{Stnlnk|Dyce}} and {{Stnlnk|New Cumnock}}, all of which had been closed in the mid-1960s. {{stnlink|Kintore}} is due to reopen in 2020.\n* The Edinburgh to Bathgate route opened in 1985, as single track. The line was doubled, electrified and extended beyond Bathgate to Airdrie in 2010, creating a fourth route between Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n* A 35-mile (56&nbsp;km) stretch of the former [[Waverley Route]] between [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and {{Stnlnk|Tweedbank}} via Galashiels [[Borders Railway|reopened]] on 6 September 2015. The closure of the line in 1969 had left the [[Scottish Borders]] without any rail links.\n*{{Stnlnk|Beauly}} (2006) and {{Stnlnk|Conon Bridge}} (2015) were reopened on the Far North Line between Inverness and Dingwall.\n\n==Heritage railways==\n{{see|List of British heritage and private railways}}\n\n==Further proposals==\n{{As of|2019||df=}}, proposals being pursued include:\n\n* [[Camp Hill

The [[Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line|line towards Kidderminster and Worcester]] was reopened to Snow Hill in 1995. \n* The line from [[Birmingham Snow Hill \u2013 Wolverhampton Low Level Line|Snow Hill to Wolverhampton]] reopened as the [[Midland Metro]] [[tram]] system.  Despite the successful and potential reopening of many rail routes as light-rail and metro lines, the concept is still under threat due to the varying popularity of these schemes with successive governments.\n* The line from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Bicester Village railway station|Bicester]] reopened in 1987 after closing in 1968\n* The line from [[Coventry to Nuneaton Line|Coventry to Nuneaton]] reopened to passengers in 1988. \n* The line from [[Coventry to Leamington line]] reopened to passengers in 1977 and the station at [[Kenilworth railway station|Kenilworth]] reopened on 30 April 2018.\n* The [[Chase Line|Walsall\u2013Hednesford line]] reopened to passengers in 1989, and was extended to [[Rugeley Town railway station|Rugeley]] in 1997. Passenger services were terminated between {{Stnlnk|Walsall}} and {{Stnlnk|Wolverhampton}} in 2008 on cost and efficiency grounds. Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[South Staffordshire Line]] between Stourbridge and Walsall is set to reopen as a part of the Midland Metro expansion scheme. The line will be shared between trams and freight trains.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n\n===North West===\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced in 1992 serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan (opened 2007), Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route. Coal traffic has subsequently ceased with the closure of Longannet Power station.\n* {{Stnlnk|Laurencekirk}} on the [[Edinburgh to Aberdeen Line|mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen]] was shut in 1967 but 42 years later in May 2009 it was reopened. This was the 77th new or reopened station in Scotland since 1970. Others include {{Stnlnk|Auchinleck}}, {{Stnlnk|Gretna Green}}, {{Stnlnk|Dyce}} and {{Stnlnk|New Cumnock}}, all of which had been closed in the mid-1960s. {{stnlink|Kintore}} is due to reopen in 2020.\n* The Edinburgh to Bathgate route opened in 1985, as single track. The line was doubled, electrified and extended beyond Bathgate to Airdrie in 2010, creating a fourth route between Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n* A 35-mile (56&nbsp;km) stretch of the former [[Waverley Route]] between [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and {{Stnlnk|Tweedbank}} via Galashiels [[Borders Railway|reopened]] on 6 September 2015. The closure of the line in 1969 had left the [[Scottish Borders]] without any rail links.\n*{{Stnlnk|Beauly}} (2006) and {{Stnlnk|Conon Bridge}} (2015) were reopened on the Far North Line between Inverness and Dingwall.\n\n==Heritage railways==\n{{see|List of British heritage and private railways}}\n\n==Further proposals==\n{{As of|2019||df=}}, proposals being pursued include:\n\n* [[Camp Hill
