The main industry is in [[forestry]] products, with [[teak]] and other [[hardwood]]s extracted from the mountains. The city is known for its [[areca]] palms, to the extent that a Burmese proverb for unexpected good fortune is equated to a \"[[betel]] lover winning a trip to Taungoo\".\n\nThe city is famous in [[History of Myanmar|Burmese history]] for the [[Toungoo dynasty]] which ruled the country for over 200 years between the 16th and 18th centuries. Taungoo was the capital of Burma in 1510\u20131539 and 1551\u20131552.\n\nKaytumadi new city (new city of Taungoo) is the central command of the southern command division region of [[Tatmadaw|Armed Forces (''Tatmadaw'')]]. [[Hanthawaddy United F.C.|Hanthawaddy United Football Club]] is based in Taungoo.\n\n== Names ==\nThe classical [[Pali]] name of Taungoo is '''Ketumadi''' (\u1000\u1031\u1010\u102f\u1019\u1012\u102e;{{Lang-pi|Ketumadi}}), which translates to \"possessed of the royal standard.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=The Baptist Missionary Magazine|last=|first=|date=1856|publisher=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Taungoo Dynasty|First Toungoo Empire}}\n\nTaungoo was founded in 1279 in the waning days of [[Pagan Dynasty|Pagan]] as part of frontier expansion southwards. After the fall of Pagan Empire in 1287, Taungoo came under the rule of [[Myinsaing Kingdom]] and later [[Pinya Kingdom]]. In 1358, Taungoo successfully revolted and became independent until 1367 when it became a nominal part of the [[Ava Kingdom]]. Its rulers retained a large degree of autonomy, playing larger Ava and Hanthawaddy kingdoms against each other. In 1470, Ava put down another rebellion and made [[Sithu Kyawhtin of Toungoo|Sithu Kyawhtin]], the general who defeated the rebellion, governor. Sithu Kyawhtin's grandson [[Mingyi Nyo]] became governor of Taungoo in 1485. Under Mingyi Nyo's leadership, the principality grew powerful. In October 1510, Mingyi Nyo formally broke away from Ava and founded the [[Toungoo dynasty|Taungoo Kingdom]].<ref name=\"mmtimes\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/534/news015.html |title=Taungoo prepares for 500th birthday |author=Shwe Yinnma Oo |journal=The Myanmar Times |date=2010-08-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804053338/http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/534/news015.html |archivedate=4 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nMingyi Nyo's successors [[Tabinshwehti]] and [[Bayinnaung]] went on to found the largest empire in the history of south-east Asia.<ref name=vbl-150>{{Cite book| author=Victor B Lieberman | title= Strange Parallels: Southeast Asia in Global Context, c. 800-1830, volume 1, Integration on the Mainland | year=2003 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | pages=150\u2013154}}</ref> Taungoo's stint as capital was short-lived, however. Tabinshwehti moved the kingdom's capital to [[Pegu]] (Bago) in 1539. The city briefly again became capital of a rebellion in 1599 when [[viceroy]] [[Minye Thihathu II of Toungoo|Minye Thihathu II]] of Taungoo declared himself king. In December 1599, Taungoo's forces in collaboration with the [[Mrauk-U Kingdom|Arakanese]] armies aided by Portuguese mercenaries, sacked [[Pegu]]. The rebellious city state remained independent for another 10 years when [[Natshinnaung]] ascended the Taungoo throne in 1609. In the following year, King [[Anaukpetlun]] captured Taungoo and ended the city's long line of rulers.<ref name=hb-140>{{Cite book| title=A History of Burma | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York and London | year=1967 | author=Maung Htin Aung | page=140 | authorlink=Htin Aung}}</ref> Although few visible historic remains survive, all four sides of the brick city wall remain from the dynastic period, with the exception of the part of the southern wall. The 9.6 m wide [[moat]] has largely dried up, except for a section on the eastern side, which is still maintained.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, Taungoo was governed by a local governor appointed by the [[Konbaung dynasty|Konbaung]] kings. The Taungoo District consisted of 52 wards, including today's [[Pyinmana]] (and [[Naypyidaw]]) regions. The district was cut in half after the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]]. The [[British Empire|British]] annexed the southern half, including the city of Taungoo while the northern portion, including Pyinmana and Ela, remained under Burmese control.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Gazetteer of Upper Burma and the Shan States, Part 2 | volume=3 | page=374 | year=1901 | author=Sir [[James George Scott]], John Percy Hardiman | publisher=Printed by the superintendent, Government printing, Burma}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, the British [[Royal Air Force]] built an airfield north of the town, which from August 1941 through February 1942 served as a training and support base for the 1st [[American Volunteer Group]], popularly known as the [[Flying Tigers]].\n\nTaungoo celebrated its 500th birthday on 16 October 2010, by reconstructing and renovating many city attractions.<ref name=\"mmtimes\"/>\n\n==Climate==\n\nTaungoo has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Aw'') bordering on a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Am'').

The main industry is in [[forestry]] products, with [[teak]] and other [[hardwood]]s extracted from the mountains. The city is known for its [[areca]] palms, to the extent that a Burmese proverb for unexpected good fortune is equated to a \"[[betel]] lover winning a trip to Taungoo\".\n\nThe city is famous in [[History of Myanmar|Burmese history]] for the [[Toungoo dynasty]] which ruled the country for over 200 years between the 16th and 18th centuries. Taungoo was the capital of Burma in 1510\u20131539 and 1551\u20131552.\n\nKaytumadi new city (new city of Taungoo) is the central command of the southern command division region of [[Tatmadaw|Armed Forces (''Tatmadaw'')]].

After the fall of Pagan Empire in 1287, Taungoo came under the rule of [[Myinsaing Kingdom]] and later [[Pinya Kingdom]]. In 1358, Taungoo successfully revolted and became independent until 1367 when it became a nominal part of the [[Ava Kingdom]]. Its rulers retained a large degree of autonomy, playing larger Ava and Hanthawaddy kingdoms against each other. In 1470, Ava put down another rebellion and made [[Sithu Kyawhtin of Toungoo|Sithu Kyawhtin]], the general who defeated the rebellion, governor. Sithu Kyawhtin's grandson [[Mingyi Nyo]] became governor of Taungoo in 1485. Under Mingyi Nyo's leadership, the principality grew powerful. In October 1510, Mingyi Nyo formally broke away from Ava and founded the [[Toungoo dynasty|Taungoo Kingdom]].<ref name=\"mmtimes\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/534/news015.html |title=Taungoo prepares for 500th birthday |author=Shwe Yinnma Oo |journal=The Myanmar Times |date=2010-08-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804053338/http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/534/news015.html |archivedate=4 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nMingyi Nyo's successors [[Tabinshwehti]] and [[Bayinnaung]] went on to found the largest empire in the history of south-east Asia.<ref name=vbl-150>{{Cite book| author=Victor B Lieberman | title= Strange Parallels: Southeast Asia in Global Context, c. 800-1830, volume 1, Integration on the Mainland | year=2003 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | pages=150\u2013154}}</ref> Taungoo's stint as capital was short-lived, however. Tabinshwehti moved the kingdom's capital to [[Pegu]] (Bago) in 1539. The city briefly again became capital of a rebellion in 1599 when [[viceroy]] [[Minye Thihathu II of Toungoo|Minye Thihathu II]] of Taungoo declared himself king. In December 1599, Taungoo's forces in collaboration with the [[Mrauk-U Kingdom|Arakanese]] armies aided by Portuguese mercenaries, sacked [[Pegu]]. The rebellious city state remained independent for another 10 years when [[Natshinnaung]] ascended the Taungoo throne in 1609. In the following year, King [[Anaukpetlun]] captured Taungoo and ended the city's long line of rulers.<ref name=hb-140>{{Cite book| title=A History of Burma | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York and London | year=1967 | author=Maung Htin Aung | page=140 | authorlink=Htin Aung}}</ref> Although few visible historic remains survive, all four sides of the brick city wall remain from the dynastic period, with the exception of the part of the southern wall. The 9.6 m wide [[moat]] has largely dried up, except for a section on the eastern side, which is still maintained.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, Taungoo was governed by a local governor appointed by the [[Konbaung dynasty|Konbaung]] kings. The Taungoo District consisted of 52 wards, including today's [[Pyinmana]] (and [[Naypyidaw]]) regions. The district was cut in half after the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]]. The [[British Empire|British]] annexed the southern half, including the city of Taungoo while the northern portion, including Pyinmana and Ela, remained under Burmese control.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Gazetteer of Upper Burma and the Shan States, Part 2 | volume=3 | page=374 | year=1901 | author=Sir [[James George Scott]], John Percy Hardiman | publisher=Printed by the superintendent, Government printing, Burma}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, the British [[Royal Air Force]] built an airfield north of the town, which from August 1941 through February 1942 served as a training and support base for the 1st [[American Volunteer Group]], popularly known as the [[Flying Tigers]].\n\nTaungoo celebrated its 500th birthday on 16 October 2010, by reconstructing and renovating many city attractions.<ref name=\"mmtimes\"/>\n\n==Climate==\n\nTaungoo has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Aw'') bordering on a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Am'').

In the 1862 the Dutch East Indies government decided to build a new museum that would not only serve as an office but also could be used to house, preserve and display the collections.\n\n[[File:Gedung Gajah Museum Nasional.jpg|right|thumb|Gedung Gajah, the old wing of National Museum.]]\n\nThe Museum was officially opened in 1868 and popularly known as ''Gedung Gajah'' (Elephant Building) or sometimes called ''Gedung Arca'' (The house of Statues). It was called ''Gedung Gajah'' on account of the bronze elephant statue in the front yard \u2013 a gift to Batavia from King [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam in 1871. It was also called ''Gedung Arca'' because a great variety of statues from different periods are on display in the house.\n\n[[File:Museum Nasional Courtyard.jpg|right|thumb|The [[peristyle]] (inner courtyard) of the National Museum, features [[Doric order]] Greek architecture.]]\n\nIn 1931, the museum's collections were shown in a world cultural exhibition in Paris. Unfortunately, a fire in the exhibition hall demolished the Dutch East Indies' exhibition pavilion and destroyed most of the objects. The museum received some insurance money as compensation and the following year these funds were used to build the old ceramics room, the bronze room, and both treasure rooms on the second floor.\n\nIn February, 1950 the institution became the ''Lembaga Kebudayaan Indonesia'' (Indonesian Culture Council).

The items were first discovered in the ruins of the Jalatunda ancient royal bathing place and in the temples on the slopes of [[Mount Penanggungan]] in [[Mojokerto Regency]], East Java. The four missing artifacts were a dragon-shaped gold plaque, a scripted crescent-shaped gold plaque and one golden-silver Harihara plaque, as well as a small golden box.

It was called ''Gedung Gajah'' on account of the bronze elephant statue in the front yard \u2013 a gift to Batavia from King [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam in 1871.

The museum received some insurance money as compensation and the following year these funds were used to build the old ceramics room, the bronze room, and both treasure rooms on the second floor.\n\nIn February, 1950 the institution became the ''Lembaga Kebudayaan Indonesia'' (Indonesian Culture Council).
