'''Jane Marple''' is described by some academics as an elderly [[spinster]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mezel|first=Kathy|date=Winter 2007|title=Spinsters, Surveillance, and Speech: The Case of Miss Marple, Miss Mole, and Miss Jekyll|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4619330?seq=1|journal=Journal of Modern Literature|publisher=Indiana University Press|volume=30|issue=2|pages=103-120|jstor=4619330|via=JSTOR}}</ref> who lives in the village of [[St. Mary Mead]] and acts as an amateur consulting [[detective]]. She is one of the best known of Christie's characters and has been portrayed numerous times on screen.

Her first appearance in a full-length novel was in ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' in 1930 and her last appearance was in ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' in 1976.\n\n==Origins==\nThe character of Miss Marple is based on friends of Christie's step grandmother/aunt (Margaret Miller, n\u00e9e West).<ref>Margaret West was the sister of Mary Ann Boehmer, Agatha Christie's maternal grandmother. Margaret married Christie's paternal grandfather, Nathaniel Frary Miller, in 1863 in Westbourne, West Sussex. He died in 1869 and she dedicated a stained glass window to his memory in St.John's Church, Main Road, Southbourne, West Sussex. Margaret's stepson, Frederick Miller, went on to marry her niece Clara, and Agatha was the result. {{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2957794/Agatha-Christie-used-her-grandmother-as-a-model-for-Miss-Marple-new-tapes-reveal.html|title=Agatha Christie used her step grandmother as a model for Miss Marple, new tapes reveal|first=Stephen|last=Adams|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2008-09-16}}</ref> Christie attributed the inspiration for the character of Miss Marple to a number of sources, stating that Miss Marple was \"the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my step grandmother's Ealing cronies \u2013 old ladies whom I have met in so many villages where I have gone to stay as a girl\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Christie|first=Agatha|title=An Autobiography|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-635328-7|page=449}}</ref> Christie also used material from her fictional creation, spinster Caroline Sheppard, who appeared in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]''. When [[Michael Morton (dramatist)|Michael Morton]] adapted the novel for the stage, he replaced the character of Caroline with a young girl. This change saddened Christie and she determined to give old maids a voice: Miss Marple was born.<ref name=\"agathachristie.com\">{{cite web|url=http://agathachristie.com/christies-work/detectives-and-sidekicks/miss-marple/|title=Characters \u2013 Miss Marple|work=Agatha Christie|accessdate=2012-10-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010144904/http://agathachristie.com/christies-work/detectives-and-sidekicks/miss-marple/|archivedate=10 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nChristie may have taken the name from [[Marple railway station]], through which she passed, or from Marple Hall, near her sister Madge's home at [[Abney Hall]].<ref name=\"Cheshire Life\">{{cite web | url=https://www.cheshirelife.co.uk/out-about/was-miss-marple-born-in-cheshire-1-1631050 | title=Was Miss Marple Born in Cheshire? | date=15 September 2010 | publisher=Cheshire Life | accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://www.poirot.us/mprofile.php \"Marple's Profile\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126123518/http://poirot.us/mprofile.php |date=26 November 2010 }}, Hercule Poirot Central, ''accessed 30 March 2009''.</ref>\n\n==Character==\nThe character of Jane Marple in the first Miss Marple book, ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'', is markedly different from how she appears in later books. This early version of Miss Marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman. The citizens of St. Mary Mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone. In later books, she becomes more modern and a kinder person.\n\nMiss Marple solves difficult crimes because of her shrewd intelligence, and St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature. Crimes always remind her of a parallel incident, although acquaintances may be bored by analogies that often lead her to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime. She also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand. In several stories, she is able to rely on her acquaintance with [[Sir Henry Clithering]], a retired commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]], for official information when required.\n\nMiss Marple never married and has no close living relatives. Her nephew, the \"well-known author\" Raymond West, appears in some stories, including ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'', ''Sleeping Murder'' and ''Ingots of Gold'' (which also feature his wife, Joyce Lempri\u00e8re). Raymond overestimates himself and underestimates his aunt's mental acuity. Miss Marple employs young women (including Clara, Emily, Alice, Esther, Gwenda, and Amy) from a nearby orphanage, whom she trains for service as general housemaids after the retirement of her long-time maid-housekeeper, faithful Florence. She was briefly looked after by her irritating companion, Miss Knight. In her later years, companion Cherry Baker, first introduced in ''The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side'', lives in.\n\nMiss Marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means, although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of Raymond West, her nephew (''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'', 1964). She is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home among them and would probably have been happy to describe herself as \"genteel\"; indeed, a ''[[gentlewoman]]''. Miss Marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of British detective fiction, the [[gentleman detective]]. She demonstrates a remarkably thorough education, including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers. In ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952), it is revealed that Miss Marple grew up in a [[cathedral close]], and that she studied at an Italian finishing school with Americans Ruth Van Rydock and Caroline \"Carrie\" Louise Serrocold.\n\nWhile Miss Marple is described as \"an old lady\" in many of the stories, her age is mentioned in \"At Bertram's Hotel\", where it is said she visited the hotel when she was fourteen and almost sixty years have passed since then. Excluding ''Sleeping Murder'', forty-one years passed between the first and last-written novels, and many characters grow and age. An example would be the Vicar's nephew: in ''The Murder at the Vicarage'', the Reverend Clement's nephew Dennis is a teenager; in ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side'', it is mentioned that the nephew is now grown and successful and has a career. The effects of ageing are seen on Miss Marple, such as needing a holiday after illness in ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' but she is if anything more agile in ''[[Nemesis (Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', set only sixteen months later.\n\nMiss Marple's background is described in some detail, albeit in glimpses across the novels and short stories in which she appears. She has a very large family, including a sister, the mother of [[Raymond West (character)|Raymond]] and Mabel Denham, a young woman who was accused of poisoning her husband Geoffrey (''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Thumb Mark of St. Peter|The Thumb Mark of St. Peter]]'').\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Miss Marple Series===\n# ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (1930, Novel)\n#''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932, Collection)\n#''[[The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories]]'' (1939, Collection)\n# ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (1942, Novel)\n# ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (1943, Novel)\n# ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (1950, Novel)\n# ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'' (1950, Collection)\n# ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952, Novel) - also published as Murder With Mirrors\n# ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (1953, Novel)\n# ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957, Novel) - also published as What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!\n# ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960, Collection)\n# ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]'' (1961, Collection)\n# ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]] (''1962, Novel)\n# ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (1964, Novel)\n# ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (1965, Novel)\n# ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (1971, Novel)\n# ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (1976, Novel)\n# ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories|Miss Marple's Final Cases]]'' (1979, Collection)\n\n===Miss Marple short story collections===\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932 short story collection featuring Miss Marple, also published as ''The Tuesday Club Murders'')\n* ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories]]'' (short stories collected posthumously, also published as ''Miss Marple's Final Cases'', but only six of the eight stories actually feature Miss Marple) (written between 1939 and 1954, published 1979)\n* ''Miss Marple: The Complete Short Stories'', published 1985, includes 20 from 4 sets: ''[[The Tuesday Club Murders]]'', ''[[The Regatta Mystery]]'', ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'', and ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]''.\n\nMiss Marple also appears in \"Greenshaw's Folly\", a short story included as part of the Poirot collection ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960).

These were successful light comedies, but were disappointing to Christie herself.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia''. NY: Simon and Schuster, 2000. 386-87.\n{{ISBN|9780671028312}} \nbooks.google.com/books?id=R3syC8weGO8C&pg=PA386</ref> Nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' to Rutherford.\n\nRutherford presented the character as a bold and eccentric old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels. As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never worked for a living, but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook-housekeeper, a stage actress, a sailor and criminal reformer, and is offered the chance to run a riding establishment-cum-hotel. Her education and genteel background are hinted at when she mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing, and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).\n\n''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961, directed by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Rutherford. This film was based on the 1957 novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy is cut from the plot. Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. Actress [[Joan Hickson]], who played Marple in the 1984-1992 television adaptations, has a role as a housekeeper in ''[[Murder, She Said]]''.<ref name=\"celebration140\"/>\n\nThe other Rutherford films, all directed by Pollock, were ''[[Murder at the Gallop]]'' (1963), based on the 1953 [[Hercule Poirot]] novel ''[[After the Funeral]]'' (in this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for); ''[[Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1964). The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from ''They Do It With Mirrors'' (viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to [[The Mousetrap|''The Mousetrap''.]] Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the parodic Hercule Poirot adventure ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).\n\nThe music to all four films was composed and conducted by [[Ron Goodwin]]. The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations in each. The main theme has a distinct 1960s feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the [[violin]]. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by Pollock after Pollock had heard about him from [[Stanley Black]]. Black had worked with Pollock on \"Stranger in Town\" in 1957 and had previously used Goodwin as his orchestrator.\n\nRutherford, who was 68 years old when the first film was shot in February 1961, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband, [[Stringer Davis]], appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'. The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721192731/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple2/shoes.html|title=Filling Miss Marple's Shoes|first=Phil|last=Clymer|accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Angela Lansbury===\nIn 1980, [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's 1962 novel. The film featured an all-star cast that included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Kim Novak]]. [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork. Lansbury's Marple was a crisp, intelligent woman who moved stiffly and spoke in clipped tones. Unlike most incarnations of Miss Marple, this one smoked cigarettes. Lansbury would find later fame in a similar role as [[Jessica Fletcher]].\n\n===Ita Ever===\nIn 1983, [[Estonians|Estonian]] stage and film actress [[Ita Ever]] starred in the [[Russian language]] [[Mosfilm]] adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (using the Russian edition's translated title, ''The Secret of the Blackbirds'') as the character of Miss Marple.<ref name=\"PBS Mystery.

[[Sue Grafton]] contributed to the screenplay of the former. Hayes's Marple was benign and chirpy. She had earlier appeared in a TV movie adaptation of the non-Marple Christie story ''Murder Is Easy'', playing an elderly lady somewhat similar to Miss Marple.\n\n===Joan Hickson===\n{{Main article|Miss Marple (TV series)}}\n\nFrom 1984 to 1992, the [[BBC]] adapted all of the original Miss Marple novels as a series titled ''Miss Marple''. [[Joan Hickson]] played the lead role. In the 1940s she had appeared on stage in an Agatha Christie play, ''[[Appointment with Death]]'', which was seen by Christie who wrote in a note to her, \"I hope one day you will play my dear Miss Marple\".<ref name=\"celebration140\">{{cite book| last = Haining| first = Peter| title = Agatha Christie: Murder in four acts : a centenary celebration of 'The Queen of Crime' on stage, films, radio & TV| year = 1990| publisher = Carol Pub Group| isbn = 978-1-85227-273-9| page = 140 }}</ref> She portrayed a maid in the 1937 film, ''[[Love from a Stranger (1937 film)|Love from a Stranger]]'', which starred Ann Harding and Basil Rathbone, another Agatha Christie play adaptation.

[[Julia McKenzie]] took over the role in the fourth season.\n\nThe adaptations change the plots and characters of the original books (e.g. incorporating lesbian affairs, changing the identities of some killers, renaming or removing significant characters, and even using stories from other books in which Miss Marple did not originally feature). In the Geraldine McEwan series it is revealed that when she was young (portrayed by [[Julie Cox]] in a flashback), Miss Marple had an affair with a married soldier, Captain Ainsworth, who was killed in action in World War I, in December 1915. It is also said (in ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'') that she served as an ambulance driver during World War I.\n\nListing of the TV series featuring Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie:\n* ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[The Sittaford Mystery]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Towards Zero]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Murder Is Easy]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Why Didn't They Ask Evans?]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[The Pale Horse (novel)|The Pale Horse]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Secret of Chimneys]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Blue Geranium|The Blue Geranium]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding#Greenshaw.27s Folly|Greenshaw's Folly]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'' (2013)\n\n===Anime===\n{{Main article|Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple}}\nFrom 2004 to 2005, Japanese TV network [[NHK]] produced a 39 episode [[anime]] series titled ''Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple'', which features both Miss Marple and [[Hercule Poirot]].

Her first appearance in a full-length novel was in ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' in 1930 and her last appearance was in ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' in 1976.\n\n==Origins==\nThe character of Miss Marple is based on friends of Christie's step grandmother/aunt (Margaret Miller, n\u00e9e West).<ref>Margaret West was the sister of Mary Ann Boehmer, Agatha Christie's maternal grandmother. Margaret married Christie's paternal grandfather, Nathaniel Frary Miller, in 1863 in Westbourne, West Sussex. He died in 1869 and she dedicated a stained glass window to his memory in St.John's Church, Main Road, Southbourne, West Sussex. Margaret's stepson, Frederick Miller, went on to marry her niece Clara, and Agatha was the result. {{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2957794/Agatha-Christie-used-her-grandmother-as-a-model-for-Miss-Marple-new-tapes-reveal.html|title=Agatha Christie used her step grandmother as a model for Miss Marple, new tapes reveal|first=Stephen|last=Adams|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2008-09-16}}</ref> Christie attributed the inspiration for the character of Miss Marple to a number of sources, stating that Miss Marple was \"the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my step grandmother's Ealing cronies \u2013 old ladies whom I have met in so many villages where I have gone to stay as a girl\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Christie|first=Agatha|title=An Autobiography|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-635328-7|page=449}}</ref> Christie also used material from her fictional creation, spinster Caroline Sheppard, who appeared in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]''. When [[Michael Morton (dramatist)|Michael Morton]] adapted the novel for the stage, he replaced the character of Caroline with a young girl. This change saddened Christie and she determined to give old maids a voice: Miss Marple was born.<ref name=\"agathachristie.com\">{{cite web|url=http://agathachristie.com/christies-work/detectives-and-sidekicks/miss-marple/|title=Characters \u2013 Miss Marple|work=Agatha Christie|accessdate=2012-10-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010144904/http://agathachristie.com/christies-work/detectives-and-sidekicks/miss-marple/|archivedate=10 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nChristie may have taken the name from [[Marple railway station]], through which she passed, or from Marple Hall, near her sister Madge's home at [[Abney Hall]].<ref name=\"Cheshire Life\">{{cite web | url=https://www.cheshirelife.co.uk/out-about/was-miss-marple-born-in-cheshire-1-1631050 | title=Was Miss Marple Born in Cheshire? | date=15 September 2010 | publisher=Cheshire Life | accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://www.poirot.us/mprofile.php \"Marple's Profile\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126123518/http://poirot.us/mprofile.php |date=26 November 2010 }}, Hercule Poirot Central, ''accessed 30 March 2009''.</ref>\n\n==Character==\nThe character of Jane Marple in the first Miss Marple book, ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'', is markedly different from how she appears in later books. This early version of Miss Marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman. The citizens of St. Mary Mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone. In later books, she becomes more modern and a kinder person.\n\nMiss Marple solves difficult crimes because of her shrewd intelligence, and St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature. Crimes always remind her of a parallel incident, although acquaintances may be bored by analogies that often lead her to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime. She also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand. In several stories, she is able to rely on her acquaintance with [[Sir Henry Clithering]], a retired commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]], for official information when required.\n\nMiss Marple never married and has no close living relatives. Her nephew, the \"well-known author\" Raymond West, appears in some stories, including ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'', ''Sleeping Murder'' and ''Ingots of Gold'' (which also feature his wife, Joyce Lempri\u00e8re). Raymond overestimates himself and underestimates his aunt's mental acuity. Miss Marple employs young women (including Clara, Emily, Alice, Esther, Gwenda, and Amy) from a nearby orphanage, whom she trains for service as general housemaids after the retirement of her long-time maid-housekeeper, faithful Florence. She was briefly looked after by her irritating companion, Miss Knight. In her later years, companion Cherry Baker, first introduced in ''The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side'', lives in.\n\nMiss Marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means, although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of Raymond West, her nephew (''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'', 1964). She is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home among them and would probably have been happy to describe herself as \"genteel\"; indeed, a ''[[gentlewoman]]''. Miss Marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of British detective fiction, the [[gentleman detective]]. She demonstrates a remarkably thorough education, including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers. In ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952), it is revealed that Miss Marple grew up in a [[cathedral close]], and that she studied at an Italian finishing school with Americans Ruth Van Rydock and Caroline \"Carrie\" Louise Serrocold.\n\nWhile Miss Marple is described as \"an old lady\" in many of the stories, her age is mentioned in \"At Bertram's Hotel\", where it is said she visited the hotel when she was fourteen and almost sixty years have passed since then. Excluding ''Sleeping Murder'', forty-one years passed between the first and last-written novels, and many characters grow and age. An example would be the Vicar's nephew: in ''The Murder at the Vicarage'', the Reverend Clement's nephew Dennis is a teenager; in ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side'', it is mentioned that the nephew is now grown and successful and has a career. The effects of ageing are seen on Miss Marple, such as needing a holiday after illness in ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' but she is if anything more agile in ''[[Nemesis (Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', set only sixteen months later.\n\nMiss Marple's background is described in some detail, albeit in glimpses across the novels and short stories in which she appears. She has a very large family, including a sister, the mother of [[Raymond West (character)|Raymond]] and Mabel Denham, a young woman who was accused of poisoning her husband Geoffrey (''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Thumb Mark of St. Peter|The Thumb Mark of St. Peter]]'').\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Miss Marple Series===\n# ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (1930, Novel)\n#''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932, Collection)\n#''[[The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories]]'' (1939, Collection)\n# ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (1942, Novel)\n# ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (1943, Novel)\n# ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (1950, Novel)\n# ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'' (1950, Collection)\n# ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952, Novel) - also published as Murder With Mirrors\n# ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (1953, Novel)\n# ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957, Novel) - also published as What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!\n# ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960, Collection)\n# ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]'' (1961, Collection)\n# ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]] (''1962, Novel)\n# ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (1964, Novel)\n# ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (1965, Novel)\n# ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (1971, Novel)\n# ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (1976, Novel)\n# ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories|Miss Marple's Final Cases]]'' (1979, Collection)\n\n===Miss Marple short story collections===\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932 short story collection featuring Miss Marple, also published as ''The Tuesday Club Murders'')\n* ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories]]'' (short stories collected posthumously, also published as ''Miss Marple's Final Cases'', but only six of the eight stories actually feature Miss Marple) (written between 1939 and 1954, published 1979)\n* ''Miss Marple: The Complete Short Stories'', published 1985, includes 20 from 4 sets: ''[[The Tuesday Club Murders]]'', ''[[The Regatta Mystery]]'', ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'', and ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]''.\n\nMiss Marple also appears in \"Greenshaw's Folly\", a short story included as part of the Poirot collection ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960).

These were successful light comedies, but were disappointing to Christie herself.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia''. NY: Simon and Schuster, 2000. 386-87.\n{{ISBN|9780671028312}} \nbooks.google.com/books?id=R3syC8weGO8C&pg=PA386</ref> Nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' to Rutherford.\n\nRutherford presented the character as a bold and eccentric old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels. As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never worked for a living, but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook-housekeeper, a stage actress, a sailor and criminal reformer, and is offered the chance to run a riding establishment-cum-hotel. Her education and genteel background are hinted at when she mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing, and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).\n\n''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961, directed by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Rutherford. This film was based on the 1957 novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy is cut from the plot. Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. Actress [[Joan Hickson]], who played Marple in the 1984-1992 television adaptations, has a role as a housekeeper in ''[[Murder, She Said]]''.<ref name=\"celebration140\"/>\n\nThe other Rutherford films, all directed by Pollock, were ''[[Murder at the Gallop]]'' (1963), based on the 1953 [[Hercule Poirot]] novel ''[[After the Funeral]]'' (in this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for); ''[[Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1964). The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from ''They Do It With Mirrors'' (viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to [[The Mousetrap|''The Mousetrap''.]] Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the parodic Hercule Poirot adventure ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).\n\nThe music to all four films was composed and conducted by [[Ron Goodwin]]. The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations in each. The main theme has a distinct 1960s feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the [[violin]]. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by Pollock after Pollock had heard about him from [[Stanley Black]]. Black had worked with Pollock on \"Stranger in Town\" in 1957 and had previously used Goodwin as his orchestrator.\n\nRutherford, who was 68 years old when the first film was shot in February 1961, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband, [[Stringer Davis]], appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'. The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721192731/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple2/shoes.html|title=Filling Miss Marple's Shoes|first=Phil|last=Clymer|accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Angela Lansbury===\nIn 1980, [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's 1962 novel. The film featured an all-star cast that included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Kim Novak]]. [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork. Lansbury's Marple was a crisp, intelligent woman who moved stiffly and spoke in clipped tones. Unlike most incarnations of Miss Marple, this one smoked cigarettes. Lansbury would find later fame in a similar role as [[Jessica Fletcher]].\n\n===Ita Ever===\nIn 1983, [[Estonians|Estonian]] stage and film actress [[Ita Ever]] starred in the [[Russian language]] [[Mosfilm]] adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (using the Russian edition's translated title, ''The Secret of the Blackbirds'') as the character of Miss Marple.<ref name=\"PBS Mystery.

[[Sue Grafton]] contributed to the screenplay of the former. Hayes's Marple was benign and chirpy. She had earlier appeared in a TV movie adaptation of the non-Marple Christie story ''Murder Is Easy'', playing an elderly lady somewhat similar to Miss Marple.\n\n===Joan Hickson===\n{{Main article|Miss Marple (TV series)}}\n\nFrom 1984 to 1992, the [[BBC]] adapted all of the original Miss Marple novels as a series titled ''Miss Marple''. [[Joan Hickson]] played the lead role. In the 1940s she had appeared on stage in an Agatha Christie play, ''[[Appointment with Death]]'', which was seen by Christie who wrote in a note to her, \"I hope one day you will play my dear Miss Marple\".<ref name=\"celebration140\">{{cite book| last = Haining| first = Peter| title = Agatha Christie: Murder in four acts : a centenary celebration of 'The Queen of Crime' on stage, films, radio & TV| year = 1990| publisher = Carol Pub Group| isbn = 978-1-85227-273-9| page = 140 }}</ref> She portrayed a maid in the 1937 film, ''[[Love from a Stranger (1937 film)|Love from a Stranger]]'', which starred Ann Harding and Basil Rathbone, another Agatha Christie play adaptation.

[[Geraldine McEwan]] starred in the first three series. [[Julia McKenzie]] took over the role in the fourth season.\n\nThe adaptations change the plots and characters of the original books (e.g. incorporating lesbian affairs, changing the identities of some killers, renaming or removing significant characters, and even using stories from other books in which Miss Marple did not originally feature). In the Geraldine McEwan series it is revealed that when she was young (portrayed by [[Julie Cox]] in a flashback), Miss Marple had an affair with a married soldier, Captain Ainsworth, who was killed in action in World War I, in December 1915. It is also said (in ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'') that she served as an ambulance driver during World War I.\n\nListing of the TV series featuring Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie:\n* ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[The Sittaford Mystery]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Towards Zero]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Murder Is Easy]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Why Didn't They Ask Evans?]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[The Pale Horse (novel)|The Pale Horse]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Secret of Chimneys]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Blue Geranium|The Blue Geranium]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding#Greenshaw.27s Folly|Greenshaw's Folly]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'' (2013)\n\n===Anime===\n{{Main article|Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple}}\nFrom 2004 to 2005, Japanese TV network [[NHK]] produced a 39 episode [[anime]] series titled ''Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple'', which features both Miss Marple and [[Hercule Poirot]].

Many Catholics supported the Act, but the Orange Order saw it as a threat to the \"Protestant constitution\" and 36 lodges in counties Armagh and Monaghan alone passed declarations opposing the Union.<ref name=\"Bardon\"/>\n\n===Suppression===\n[[File:Dollysbrae Road - geograph.org.uk - 100732.jpg|thumb|left|Dolly's Brae, site of the \"[[Dolly's Brae conflict|Battle of Dolly's Brae]]\" (1849) between Orangemen and Catholic Ribbonmen]]\nIn the early nineteenth century, Orangemen were heavily involved in violent conflict with an Irish Catholic secret society called the [[Ribbonism|Ribbonmen]]. One instance, publicised in a 7 October 1816 edition of the ''Boston Commercial Gazette'', included the murder of a Catholic priest and several members of the congregation of Dumreilly parish in [[County Cavan]] on 25 May 1816. According to the article, \"A number of Orangemen with arms rushed into the church and fired upon the congregation\".<ref>Murder in Ireland. (7 October 1816 ). Boston Commercial Gazette, http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3562/3410213113_a106a44149_o.jpg</ref> On 19 July 1823 the Unlawful Oaths Bill was passed, banning all oath-bound societies in Ireland. This included the Orange Order, which had to be dissolved and reconstituted. In 1825 a bill banning unlawful associations \u2013 largely directed at [[Daniel O'Connell]] and his [[Catholic Association]], compelled the Orangemen once more to dissolve their association. When [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] finally granted [[Catholic Emancipation]] in 1829, Roman Catholics were free to take seats as MPs (and take up various other positions of influence and power from which they had been excluded) and play a part in framing the laws of the land. The likelihood of Irish Catholic members holding the balance of power in the Westminster Parliament further increased the alarm of Orangemen in Ireland, as O'Connell's 'Repeal' movement aimed to bring about the restoration of a separate Irish Parliament in Dublin, which would have a Catholic majority, thereby ending to the Protestant Ascendancy. From this moment on, the Orange Order re-emerged in a new and even more militant form.<ref>Tony Gray ''The Orange Order'', Rodley Head London (1972), pp. 103\u2013106 {{ISBN|0-370-01340-9}}</ref>\n\nIn 1836 the Order was accused of plotting to place [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]] and Imperial Grand Master of the Orange Order, on the throne in place of [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] when [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] died; once the plot was revealed the House of Commons called upon the King to disband the Order.<ref>\"The Cumberland Plot\"  New Zealand Tablet, Volume XXIX, Issue 5, 31 January 1901, Page 3</ref> Under pressure from [[Joseph Hume]], [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|William Molesworth]] and [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], the King indicated measures would have to be taken and the Duke of Cumberland was forced to dissolve the Orange lodges.<ref>Murphy, James H.

This was eventually lifted after a campaign of disobedience led by [[William Johnston of Ballykilbeg]].\n\n===Revival===\nBy the late 19th century, the Order was in decline. However, its fortunes were revived in the 1880s after its embrace by the landlords in opposition to both the [[Irish Land League]] and later [[Irish Home Rule bills|Home Rule]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0-iGAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=orange+order+land+league#v=onepage&q=orange%20order%20land%20league&f=false|title=Defenders of the Union|accessdate=26 April 2016|isbn=9781134687435|last1=George Boyce|first1=D.|last2=O'Day|first2=Alan|date=4 January 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=c2WNAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT26&lpg=PT26&dq=orange+order+land+league#v=onepage&q=orange%20order%20land%20league&f=false|title=The Orange Order|accessdate=26 April 2016|isbn=9781847175113|last1=Jess|first1=Mervyn|date=4 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofshankillroad.weebly.com/orange-order.html|title=History Of The Shankill Road|accessdate=26 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsm.ie/c/orange-order-history-parades|title=The Orange Order: an enemy of ALL workers - Workers Solidarity Movement|accessdate=26 April 2016}}</ref> The Order was heavily involved in opposition to [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s first [[Irish Home Rule Bill 1886]], and was instrumental in the formation of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP). Protestant opposition to Irish self-government under Roman Catholic influence was intense, especially in the Protestant-dominated province of [[Ulster]].\n\nIn the first decade of the twentieth century, the Order suffered a split when [[Thomas Sloan]] left the organisation to set up the [[Independent Orange Order]]. Sloan had been suspended after running against the official unionist candidate on a pro-[[Belfast Protestant Association]] platform in the [[1902 Belfast South by-election]].\n\n===Role in the partition of Ireland===\n[[File:12 July in Belfast, 2011 (130).JPG|thumb|An [[Banners in Northern Ireland|Orange banner]] showing the signing of the [[Ulster Covenant]]]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date = March 2008}}\nIn 1912 the [[Third Home Rule Bill]] was introduced in the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|British House of Commons]]. However, its introduction would be delayed until 1914. The Orange Order, along with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] and unionists in general, were inflexible in opposing the Bill.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The Order helped to organise the 1912 [[Ulster Covenant]] \u2013 a pledge to oppose Home Rule which was signed by up to 500,000 people.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In 1911 some Orangemen began to arm themselves and train as militias. In 1913 the [[Ulster Unionist Council]] decided to bring these groups under central control, creating the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1912)|Ulster Volunteer Force]], an Ulster-wide militia dedicated to resisting Home Rule. There was a strong overlap between Orange Lodges and UVF units.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} A large shipment of rifles was imported from Germany to arm them in April 1914, in what became known as the [[Larne gun-running]].\n\nHowever, the crisis was interrupted by the outbreak of the [[World War I]] in August 1914, which caused the Home Rule Bill to be suspended for the duration of the war. Many Orangemen served in the war with the [[36th (Ulster) Division]], suffering heavy losses, and commemorations of their sacrifice are still an important element of Orange ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe Fourth Home Rule Act was passed as the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]; the six northeastern counties of Ulster became [[Northern Ireland]] and the other twenty-six counties became [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]. This self-governing entity within the United Kingdom was confirmed in its status under the terms of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921, and in its borders by the [[Boundary Commission (Ireland)|Boundary Commission]] agreement of 1925. Southern Ireland became first the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 and then in 1949 a [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]].\n\n===Since 1921===\n[[File:James Craig Viscount Craigavon.jpg|300px|thumb|Orangeman [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], the first [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]].]]\nThe Orange Order had a central place in the new state of Northern Ireland.

As such the Order only accepts those who confess a belief in a Protestant religion. As well as Catholics, [[Creed#Christians without creeds|non-creedal]] and non-[[Trinitarian]] Christians are also banned. This includes members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormons]]), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]], and some branches of [[Quakers]].\n\nPrevious rules specifically forbade Roman Catholics and their close relatives from joining<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"ExplainingNI\"/><ref name=\"TOM\"/> but the current rules  use the wording \"non-reformed faith\" instead.

Both the Grand Lodge and various individual lodges have published numerous booklets about William and the Battle of the Boyne, often aiming to show that they have continued relevance, and sometimes comparing the actions of William's adversary [[James II of England|James II]] with those of the [[Northern Ireland Office]]. Furthermore, historical articles are often published in the Order's monthly newspaper ''The Orange Standard''<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.grandorangelodge.co.uk/orange-standard#.WaSjE-SWyHs|title= The Orange Standard |location= [[Belfast]] |publisher= Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland |oclc= 65776547}}</ref> (available in a print edition and also electronically) and the Twelfth souvenir booklet.

There are many parades on and around 1 July in commemoration of the Somme, although the war memorial aspect is more obvious in some parades than others. There are several memorial lodges, and a number of banners which depict the Battle of the Somme, war memorials, or other commemorative images.

[[Mortimer O'Sullivan]], a converted Roman Catholic, was a Grand Chaplain of the Orange Order in Ireland. In the 1950s, Scotland also had a former Roman Catholic as a Grand Chaplain, the Rev. William McDermott.\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe Orange Institution in Ireland has the structure of a pyramid. At its base are about 1400 private lodges; every Orangeman belongs to a private lodge. Each private lodge sends six representatives to the district lodge, of which there are 126. Depending on size, each district lodge sends seven to thirteen representatives to the county lodge, of which there are 12. Each of these sends representatives to the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, which heads the Orange Order.\n\nThe Grand Lodge of Ireland has 373 members. As a result, much of the real power in the Order resides in the Central Committee of the Grand Lodge, which is made up of three members from each of the six counties of Northern Ireland (Down, Antrim, Armagh, Londonderry, Tyrone and Fermanagh) as well as the two other County Lodges in Northern Ireland, the City of Belfast Grand Lodge and the City of Londonderry Grand Orange Lodge, two each from the remaining Ulster counties (Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan), one from Leitrim, and 19 others. There are other committees of the Grand Lodge, including rules revision, finance, and education.\n\nDespite this hierarchy, private lodges are basically autonomous as long as they generally obey the rules of the Institution. Breaking these can lead to suspension of the lodge's warrant \u2013 essentially the dissolution of the lodge \u2013 by the Grand Lodge, but this rarely occurs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Private lodges may disobey policies laid down by senior lodges without consequence. For example, several lodges have failed to expel members convicted of murder despite a rule stating that anyone convicted of a serious crime should be expelled,<ref>Peter Taylor, ''Loyalists'', London, 1999, pp.151\u20132.</ref> and [[Portadown]] lodges have negotiated with the [[Parades Commission]] in defiance of Grand Lodge policy that the Commission should not be acknowledged.\n\nPrivate lodges wishing to change Orange Order rules or policy can submit a resolution to their district lodge, which may submit it upwards until it eventually reaches the Grand Lodge.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nAll Lodge meetings commence with the reading of the Bible and prayers that non-practising Protestants, Roman Catholics and people of other faiths and none, 'may become wise unto salvation' (which is direct quote from 2 Timothy 3:15 in the Bible).<ref>Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Resolutions 2011, http://www.grandorangelodge.co.uk/press/Orange-Standard/2011-Standard/1107-Julyl2011/article2.html{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news\n| author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n| title        = So What Really Happens Behind Lodge Doors\n| url          = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/so-what-really-happens-behind-lodge-doors-13443749.html\n| newspaper    = Belfast Telegraph\n| location     = \n| date         = \n| access-date  =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Related organisations==\n[[File:Orange marcher.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An Orangewoman marching in an Orange Order parade in [[Glasgow]].]]\n\n===Association of Loyal Orangewomen of Ireland===\nA distinct<ref name=\"MJess\">{{cite web | last = Jess | first = Mervyn | title = So, what really happens behind lodge doors&nbsp;... | work = The Orange Order| publisher = [[Belfast Telegraph]] | date = 22 May 2007 | url = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/features/daily-features/article2568169.ece | doi = | accessdate =24 February 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> women's organisation grew up out of the Orange Order.

In the 1950s and 60s the Independents focused primarily on religious issues, especially the maintenance of Sunday as a holy day and separation of politics from religion. With the outbreak of the Troubles, [[Ian Paisley]] began regularly speaking at Independent meetings, although he was never a member. As a result, the Independent Institution has become associated with Paisley and the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]] and [[Democratic Unionist Party]]. Recently the relationship between the two Orange Institutions has improved, with joint church services being held. Some people believe that this will ultimately result in a healing of the split which led to the Independent Orange Institution breaking away from the mainstream Order. Like the main Order, the Independent Institution parades and holds meetings on the Twelfth of July. It is based mainly in north [[County Antrim|Antrim]].\n\n===Royal Black Institution===\n{{Main|Royal Black Institution}}\nThe Royal Black Institution was formed out of the Orange Order two years after the founding of the parent body. Although it is a separate organisation, one of the requirements for membership in the Royal Black is membership of the Orange Order and to be no less than 17 years old. The membership is exclusively male and the Royal Black Chapter is generally considered to be more religious and respectable in its proceedings than the Orange Order.\n\n===Apprentice Boys of Derry===\n{{Main|Apprentice Boys of Derry}}\nThe Apprentice Boys of Derry exist for their acts during the siege of Derry from James II. Although they have no formal connection with the Orange Order, the two societies have overlapping membership.\n\n==Throughout the world==\nThe Orange Order was brought to other parts of the [[English-speaking world]] by Ulster Protestant migrants and missionaries. Grand Lodges have been set up in Scotland, England, Wales, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and West Africa. However, the Grand Lodges of Ireland and Scotland have always been the largest by far. The Imperial Grand Orange Council is made up of representatives from all of these various Grand Lodges. It has the power to arbitrate in disputes between Grand Lodges, and in internal disputes when invited.\n\nFamous Orangemen have included Dr [[Thomas Barnardo]], who joined the Order in Dublin; [[Mackenzie Bowell]], who was Grandmaster of the Orange Order of British North America before becoming the Prime Minister of Canada; [[William Massey]], who was Prime Minister of New Zealand; [[Harry Ferguson]], inventor of the Ferguson tractor; and [[Harold Alexander|Earl Alexander]], the Second World War general.

It was also claimed that if an attempt had been made then \"the whole of Ulster would be as bad as Antrim and Down\", where the United Irishmen rebellion was at its strongest.<ref name=\"Bardon\"/> However, sectarian massacres by the Defenders in [[County Wexford]] \"did much to dampen\" the rebellion in Ulster.<ref name=\"Bardon\"/> The [[Scullabogue Barn massacre]] saw over 100 non-combatant (mostly Protestant) men, women, and children imprisoned in a barn which was then set alight,<ref name=\"Dunne\">Dunne, Tom; ''Rebellions: Memoir, Memory and 1798''.

Many Catholics supported the Act, but the Orange Order saw it as a threat to the \"Protestant constitution\" and 36 lodges in counties Armagh and Monaghan alone passed declarations opposing the Union.<ref name=\"Bardon\"/>\n\n===Suppression===\n[[File:Dollysbrae Road - geograph.org.uk - 100732.jpg|thumb|left|Dolly's Brae, site of the \"[[Dolly's Brae conflict|Battle of Dolly's Brae]]\" (1849) between Orangemen and Catholic Ribbonmen]]\nIn the early nineteenth century, Orangemen were heavily involved in violent conflict with an Irish Catholic secret society called the [[Ribbonism|Ribbonmen]]. One instance, publicised in a 7 October 1816 edition of the ''Boston Commercial Gazette'', included the murder of a Catholic priest and several members of the congregation of Dumreilly parish in [[County Cavan]] on 25 May 1816. According to the article, \"A number of Orangemen with arms rushed into the church and fired upon the congregation\".<ref>Murder in Ireland. (7 October 1816 ). Boston Commercial Gazette, http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3562/3410213113_a106a44149_o.jpg</ref> On 19 July 1823 the Unlawful Oaths Bill was passed, banning all oath-bound societies in Ireland. This included the Orange Order, which had to be dissolved and reconstituted. In 1825 a bill banning unlawful associations \u2013 largely directed at [[Daniel O'Connell]] and his [[Catholic Association]], compelled the Orangemen once more to dissolve their association. When [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] finally granted [[Catholic Emancipation]] in 1829, Roman Catholics were free to take seats as MPs (and take up various other positions of influence and power from which they had been excluded) and play a part in framing the laws of the land. The likelihood of Irish Catholic members holding the balance of power in the Westminster Parliament further increased the alarm of Orangemen in Ireland, as O'Connell's 'Repeal' movement aimed to bring about the restoration of a separate Irish Parliament in Dublin, which would have a Catholic majority, thereby ending to the Protestant Ascendancy. From this moment on, the Orange Order re-emerged in a new and even more militant form.<ref>Tony Gray ''The Orange Order'', Rodley Head London (1972), pp. 103\u2013106 {{ISBN|0-370-01340-9}}</ref>\n\nIn 1836 the Order was accused of plotting to place [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland]] and Imperial Grand Master of the Orange Order, on the throne in place of [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] when [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] died; once the plot was revealed the House of Commons called upon the King to disband the Order.<ref>\"The Cumberland Plot\"  New Zealand Tablet, Volume XXIX, Issue 5, 31 January 1901, Page 3</ref> Under pressure from [[Joseph Hume]], [[Sir William Molesworth, 8th Baronet|William Molesworth]] and [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], the King indicated measures would have to be taken and the Duke of Cumberland was forced to dissolve the Orange lodges.<ref>Murphy, James H.

This was eventually lifted after a campaign of disobedience led by [[William Johnston of Ballykilbeg]].\n\n===Revival===\nBy the late 19th century, the Order was in decline. However, its fortunes were revived in the 1880s after its embrace by the landlords in opposition to both the [[Irish Land League]] and later [[Irish Home Rule bills|Home Rule]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0-iGAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=orange+order+land+league#v=onepage&q=orange%20order%20land%20league&f=false|title=Defenders of the Union|accessdate=26 April 2016|isbn=9781134687435|last1=George Boyce|first1=D.|last2=O'Day|first2=Alan|date=4 January 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=c2WNAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT26&lpg=PT26&dq=orange+order+land+league#v=onepage&q=orange%20order%20land%20league&f=false|title=The Orange Order|accessdate=26 April 2016|isbn=9781847175113|last1=Jess|first1=Mervyn|date=4 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://historyofshankillroad.weebly.com/orange-order.html|title=History Of The Shankill Road|accessdate=26 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsm.ie/c/orange-order-history-parades|title=The Orange Order: an enemy of ALL workers - Workers Solidarity Movement|accessdate=26 April 2016}}</ref> The Order was heavily involved in opposition to [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s first [[Irish Home Rule Bill 1886]], and was instrumental in the formation of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP). Protestant opposition to Irish self-government under Roman Catholic influence was intense, especially in the Protestant-dominated province of [[Ulster]].\n\nIn the first decade of the twentieth century, the Order suffered a split when [[Thomas Sloan]] left the organisation to set up the [[Independent Orange Order]]. Sloan had been suspended after running against the official unionist candidate on a pro-[[Belfast Protestant Association]] platform in the [[1902 Belfast South by-election]].\n\n===Role in the partition of Ireland===\n[[File:12 July in Belfast, 2011 (130).JPG|thumb|An [[Banners in Northern Ireland|Orange banner]] showing the signing of the [[Ulster Covenant]]]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date = March 2008}}\nIn 1912 the [[Third Home Rule Bill]] was introduced in the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|British House of Commons]]. However, its introduction would be delayed until 1914. The Orange Order, along with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] and unionists in general, were inflexible in opposing the Bill.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The Order helped to organise the 1912 [[Ulster Covenant]] \u2013 a pledge to oppose Home Rule which was signed by up to 500,000 people.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In 1911 some Orangemen began to arm themselves and train as militias. In 1913 the [[Ulster Unionist Council]] decided to bring these groups under central control, creating the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1912)|Ulster Volunteer Force]], an Ulster-wide militia dedicated to resisting Home Rule. There was a strong overlap between Orange Lodges and UVF units.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} A large shipment of rifles was imported from Germany to arm them in April 1914, in what became known as the [[Larne gun-running]].\n\nHowever, the crisis was interrupted by the outbreak of the [[World War I]] in August 1914, which caused the Home Rule Bill to be suspended for the duration of the war. Many Orangemen served in the war with the [[36th (Ulster) Division]], suffering heavy losses, and commemorations of their sacrifice are still an important element of Orange ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe Fourth Home Rule Act was passed as the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]; the six northeastern counties of Ulster became [[Northern Ireland]] and the other twenty-six counties became [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]. This self-governing entity within the United Kingdom was confirmed in its status under the terms of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921, and in its borders by the [[Boundary Commission (Ireland)|Boundary Commission]] agreement of 1925. Southern Ireland became first the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922 and then in 1949 a [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]].\n\n===Since 1921===\n[[File:James Craig Viscount Craigavon.jpg|300px|thumb|Orangeman [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], the first [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]].]]\nThe Orange Order had a central place in the new state of Northern Ireland.

As such the Order only accepts those who confess a belief in a Protestant religion. As well as Catholics, [[Creed#Christians without creeds|non-creedal]] and non-[[Trinitarian]] Christians are also banned. This includes members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormons]]), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]], and some branches of [[Quakers]].\n\nPrevious rules specifically forbade Roman Catholics and their close relatives from joining<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"ExplainingNI\"/><ref name=\"TOM\"/> but the current rules  use the wording \"non-reformed faith\" instead.

Both the Grand Lodge and various individual lodges have published numerous booklets about William and the Battle of the Boyne, often aiming to show that they have continued relevance, and sometimes comparing the actions of William's adversary [[James II of England|James II]] with those of the [[Northern Ireland Office]]. Furthermore, historical articles are often published in the Order's monthly newspaper ''The Orange Standard''<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.grandorangelodge.co.uk/orange-standard#.WaSjE-SWyHs|title= The Orange Standard |location= [[Belfast]] |publisher= Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland |oclc= 65776547}}</ref> (available in a print edition and also electronically) and the Twelfth souvenir booklet.

There are many parades on and around 1 July in commemoration of the Somme, although the war memorial aspect is more obvious in some parades than others. There are several memorial lodges, and a number of banners which depict the Battle of the Somme, war memorials, or other commemorative images.

[[Mortimer O'Sullivan]], a converted Roman Catholic, was a Grand Chaplain of the Orange Order in Ireland. In the 1950s, Scotland also had a former Roman Catholic as a Grand Chaplain, the Rev. William McDermott.\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe Orange Institution in Ireland has the structure of a pyramid. At its base are about 1400 private lodges; every Orangeman belongs to a private lodge. Each private lodge sends six representatives to the district lodge, of which there are 126. Depending on size, each district lodge sends seven to thirteen representatives to the county lodge, of which there are 12. Each of these sends representatives to the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, which heads the Orange Order.\n\nThe Grand Lodge of Ireland has 373 members. As a result, much of the real power in the Order resides in the Central Committee of the Grand Lodge, which is made up of three members from each of the six counties of Northern Ireland (Down, Antrim, Armagh, Londonderry, Tyrone and Fermanagh) as well as the two other County Lodges in Northern Ireland, the City of Belfast Grand Lodge and the City of Londonderry Grand Orange Lodge, two each from the remaining Ulster counties (Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan), one from Leitrim, and 19 others. There are other committees of the Grand Lodge, including rules revision, finance, and education.\n\nDespite this hierarchy, private lodges are basically autonomous as long as they generally obey the rules of the Institution. Breaking these can lead to suspension of the lodge's warrant \u2013 essentially the dissolution of the lodge \u2013 by the Grand Lodge, but this rarely occurs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Private lodges may disobey policies laid down by senior lodges without consequence. For example, several lodges have failed to expel members convicted of murder despite a rule stating that anyone convicted of a serious crime should be expelled,<ref>Peter Taylor, ''Loyalists'', London, 1999, pp.151\u20132.</ref> and [[Portadown]] lodges have negotiated with the [[Parades Commission]] in defiance of Grand Lodge policy that the Commission should not be acknowledged.\n\nPrivate lodges wishing to change Orange Order rules or policy can submit a resolution to their district lodge, which may submit it upwards until it eventually reaches the Grand Lodge.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nAll Lodge meetings commence with the reading of the Bible and prayers that non-practising Protestants, Roman Catholics and people of other faiths and none, 'may become wise unto salvation' (which is direct quote from 2 Timothy 3:15 in the Bible).<ref>Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Resolutions 2011, http://www.grandorangelodge.co.uk/press/Orange-Standard/2011-Standard/1107-Julyl2011/article2.html{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news\n| author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n| title        = So What Really Happens Behind Lodge Doors\n| url          = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/so-what-really-happens-behind-lodge-doors-13443749.html\n| newspaper    = Belfast Telegraph\n| location     = \n| date         = \n| access-date  =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Related organisations==\n[[File:Orange marcher.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An Orangewoman marching in an Orange Order parade in [[Glasgow]].]]\n\n===Association of Loyal Orangewomen of Ireland===\nA distinct<ref name=\"MJess\">{{cite web | last = Jess | first = Mervyn | title = So, what really happens behind lodge doors&nbsp;... | work = The Orange Order| publisher = [[Belfast Telegraph]] | date = 22 May 2007 | url = http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/features/daily-features/article2568169.ece | doi = | accessdate =24 February 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> women's organisation grew up out of the Orange Order.

In the 1950s and 60s the Independents focused primarily on religious issues, especially the maintenance of Sunday as a holy day and separation of politics from religion. With the outbreak of the Troubles, [[Ian Paisley]] began regularly speaking at Independent meetings, although he was never a member. As a result, the Independent Institution has become associated with Paisley and the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]] and [[Democratic Unionist Party]]. Recently the relationship between the two Orange Institutions has improved, with joint church services being held. Some people believe that this will ultimately result in a healing of the split which led to the Independent Orange Institution breaking away from the mainstream Order. Like the main Order, the Independent Institution parades and holds meetings on the Twelfth of July. It is based mainly in north [[County Antrim|Antrim]].\n\n===Royal Black Institution===\n{{Main|Royal Black Institution}}\nThe Royal Black Institution was formed out of the Orange Order two years after the founding of the parent body. Although it is a separate organisation, one of the requirements for membership in the Royal Black is membership of the Orange Order and to be no less than 17 years old. The membership is exclusively male and the Royal Black Chapter is generally considered to be more religious and respectable in its proceedings than the Orange Order.\n\n===Apprentice Boys of Derry===\n{{Main|Apprentice Boys of Derry}}\nThe Apprentice Boys of Derry exist for their acts during the siege of Derry from James II. Although they have no formal connection with the Orange Order, the two societies have overlapping membership.\n\n==Throughout the world==\nThe Orange Order was brought to other parts of the [[English-speaking world]] by Ulster Protestant migrants and missionaries. Grand Lodges have been set up in Scotland, England, Wales, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and West Africa. However, the Grand Lodges of Ireland and Scotland have always been the largest by far. The Imperial Grand Orange Council is made up of representatives from all of these various Grand Lodges. It has the power to arbitrate in disputes between Grand Lodges, and in internal disputes when invited.\n\nFamous Orangemen have included Dr [[Thomas Barnardo]], who joined the Order in Dublin; [[Mackenzie Bowell]], who was Grandmaster of the Orange Order of British North America before becoming the Prime Minister of Canada; [[William Massey]], who was Prime Minister of New Zealand; [[Harry Ferguson]], inventor of the Ferguson tractor; and [[Harold Alexander|Earl Alexander]], the Second World War general.

The station serves south Basking Ridge as well as the Hills and [[Liberty Corner, New Jersey|Liberty Corner]].\n\n== History ==\nLyons Station was originally built in 1931 by [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] to coincide with electrification and to serve the new VA Medical Center in Lyons (opened in 1930). It was the last station built by the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad in New Jersey and the second-to-last station depot built overall by the DL&W, behind the station at [[Syracuse, New York]] in 1941.<ref name=\"yanosey\" /> The single station building, on the north side of the single track, is a Tudor Revival and Mission Revival style structure. Designed by Delaware Lackawanna and Western Railroad architect D.T. Mack or one of his staff, it is of brick and stucco construction and has limestone trim with carved rosette ornamentation at the gable ends. The station depot also features freight doors on the right side. A brass ornamental arch stands on the westernmost part of the platform.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://visitsomersetnj.org/fun-somerset-nj/lyons-train-station/|title=Lyons Train Station {{!}} Visit Somerset County NJ|work=Visit Somerset NJ|access-date=March 4, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The [[station building]] was listed in the [[New Jersey Register of Historic Places]] on March 17, 1984 and in [[National Register of Historic Places]] on June 22, 1984 as part of the [[Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource (New Jersey)|Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource]].<ref>{{NRHP url|id=84002805|title=Lyons New Jersey Transit Railroad Station Survey}}</ref><ref name=\"NJRHPO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.gov/dep/hpo/1identify/nrsr_lists.htm|title=New Jersey and National Register Listings|date=|publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] - Historic Preservation Office|accessdate=November 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 Bernards Township applied for a grant to repoint, and perform structural repairs on the station building. Bernards was later awarded a $103,000 grant to fund those improvements. In November 2015, it was announced that Bernards Township was awarded a second grant of $96,580 through the Somerset County Historic Preservation Commission to restore the station depot and canopy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tapinto.net/towns/basking-ridge/articles/second-grant-for-sprucing-up-historic-lyons-train|title=Second Grant For Sprucing Up Historic Lyons Train Station|work=TAPinto|access-date=March 4, 2018|language=en}}</ref> In January 2016, restoration work began on the station canopy.

This makes Lyons one of the only stations along the Gladstone Branch that is handicap-accessible. The station building is open on weekdays only from 5:05 AM to 1:05 PM with a break from 9:50 AM to 10:20 AM. Two Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) and bicycle racks are located next to the station building. To the left of the building is a small outdoor waiting area with benches. There is a railroad crossing on either end of the station allowing access to the far parking lot. Bicycle racks are located right outside the station depot. The 95-space parking lot on the platform side is owned by the municipality for permit parking, while the 236-space far parking lot owned by Park America is used for both daily and permit parking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.njtransit.com/rg/rg_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=TrainStationLookupFrom&selStation=76|title=New Jersey Transit|website=www.njtransit.com|access-date=March 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray; border-bottom:solid 1px gray\" rowspan=4 width=75|'''Ground/<br>platform level'''\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Track '''1'''\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 {{rcb|system=NJ Transit|line=Gladstone|inline=yes}} toward [[Gladstone station (NJ Transit)|Gladstone]] <small>([[Basking Ridge station|Basking Ridge]])</small><br>{{0|\u2190}} {{rcb|system=NJ Transit|line=Gladstone|inline=yes}} toward [[Summit station (NJ Transit)|Summit]], [[Hoboken Terminal|Hoboken]] or [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York]] <small>([[Millington station|Millington]])</small> \u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|<small>[[Side platform]], doors will open on the left or right</small>\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Street level\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=500|Ticket machine and parking\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of New Jersey Transit stations]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commonscat-inline|Lyons (NJT station)}}\n{{NJT links}}\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=40.684942,-74.550111&spn=0.004052,0.013679&z=17&layer=c&cbll=40.685019,-74.549981&panoid=S2nljsUvScmLEe7tQZiD1g&cbp=12,98.95,,0,3.66 Station from Google Maps Street View]\n\n{{NJT stations navbox}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey}}\n{{NRHP in Somerset County, New Jersey}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lyons (Njt Station)}}\n[[Category:1872 establishments in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Bernards Township, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:NJ Transit Rail Operations stations]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1872]]\n[[Category:Former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad stations]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in Somerset County, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Tudor Revival architecture in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Mission Revival architecture in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Somerset County, New Jersey]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2009}}\n{{Infobox station\n | name          = Lyons\n | style         = NJ Transit\n | image         = Lyons Station - facing westbound.jpg\n | image_caption = The station at Lyons in 2010.

It was the last station built by the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad in New Jersey and the second-to-last station depot built overall by the DL&W, behind the station at [[Syracuse, New York]] in 1941.<ref name=\"yanosey\" /> The single station building, on the north side of the single track, is a Tudor Revival and Mission Revival style structure. Designed by Delaware Lackawanna and Western Railroad architect D.T. Mack or one of his staff, it is of brick and stucco construction and has limestone trim with carved rosette ornamentation at the gable ends. The station depot also features freight doors on the right side. A brass ornamental arch stands on the westernmost part of the platform.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://visitsomersetnj.org/fun-somerset-nj/lyons-train-station/|title=Lyons Train Station {{!}} Visit Somerset County NJ|work=Visit Somerset NJ|access-date=2018-03-04|language=en-US}}</ref> The [[station building]] was listed in the [[New Jersey Register of Historic Places]] on March 17, 1984 and in [[National Register of Historic Places]] on June 22, 1984 as part of the [[Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource (New Jersey)|Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource]].<ref>{{NRHP url|id=84002805|title=Lyons New Jersey Transit Railroad Station Survey}}</ref><ref name=\"NJRHPO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.gov/dep/hpo/1identify/nrsr_lists.htm|title=New Jersey and National Register Listings|date=|publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] - Historic Preservation Office|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 Bernards Township applied for a grant to repoint, and perform structural repairs on the station building. Bernards was later awarded a $103,000 grant to fund those improvements. In November 2015, it was announced that Bernards Township was awarded a second grant of $96,580 through the Somerset County Historic Preservation Commission to restore the station depot and canopy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tapinto.net/towns/basking-ridge/articles/second-grant-for-sprucing-up-historic-lyons-train|title=Second Grant For Sprucing Up Historic Lyons Train Station|work=TAPinto|access-date=2018-03-04|language=en}}</ref> In January 2016, restoration work began on the station canopy.

This makes Lyons one of the only stations along the Gladstone Branch that is handicap-accessible. The station building is open on weekdays only from 5:05 AM to 1:05 PM with a break from 9:50 AM to 10:20 AM. Two Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) and bicycle racks are located next to the station building. To the left of the building is a small outdoor waiting area with benches. There is a railroad crossing on either end of the station allowing access to the far parking lot. Bicycle racks are located right outside the station depot. The 95-space parking lot on the platform side is owned by the municipality for permit parking, while the 236-space far parking lot owned by Park America is used for both daily and permit parking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.njtransit.com/rg/rg_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=TrainStationLookupFrom&selStation=76|title=New Jersey Transit|website=www.njtransit.com|access-date=2018-03-04}}</ref>\n\n{|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray; border-bottom:solid 1px gray\" rowspan=4 width=75|'''Ground/<br>platform level'''\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Track '''1'''\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 {{rcb|system=NJ Transit|line=Gladstone|inline=yes}} toward [[Gladstone station (NJ Transit)|Gladstone]] <small>([[Basking Ridge station|Basking Ridge]])</small><br>{{0|\u2190}} {{rcb|system=NJ Transit|line=Gladstone|inline=yes}} toward [[Summit station (NJ Transit)|Summit]], [[Hoboken Terminal|Hoboken]] or [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York]] <small>([[Millington station|Millington]])</small> \u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|<small>[[Side platform]], doors will open on the left or right</small>\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Street level\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=500|Ticket machine and parking\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of New Jersey Transit stations]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commonscat-inline|Lyons (NJT station)}}\n{{NJT links}}\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=40.684942,-74.550111&spn=0.004052,0.013679&z=17&layer=c&cbll=40.685019,-74.549981&panoid=S2nljsUvScmLEe7tQZiD1g&cbp=12,98.95,,0,3.66 Station from Google Maps Street View]\n\n{{NJT stations navbox}}\n{{National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey}}\n{{NRHP in Somerset County, New Jersey}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lyons (Njt Station)}}\n[[Category:1872 establishments in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Bernards Township, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:NJ Transit Rail Operations stations]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1872]]\n[[Category:Former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad stations]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in Somerset County, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Tudor Revival architecture in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Mission Revival architecture in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Somerset County, New Jersey]]\n", "name_user": "Kew Gardens 613", "label": "safe", "comment": "date formats perMOS:DATEFORMATbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyons_station"}

Moor]], one of the pioneering theoreticians in the field of [[computer ethics]], defines four kinds of ethical robots. As an extensive researcher on the studies of [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of science]], and [[logic]], Moor defines machines to be ethical impact agents, implicit ethical agents, explicit ethical agents, or full ethical agents. A machine can be more than one type of agent.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moor |first1=James M. |title=Four Kinds of Ethical Robots |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/72/Four_Kinds_of_Ethical_Robots |website=Philosophy Now |date=2009}}</ref>\n*'''Ethical impact agents''': These are machine systems that carry an ethical impact whether intended or not. At the same time, these agents have the potential to act unethical. Moor gives a hypothetical example called the 'Goodman agent', named after philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]]. The Goodman agent compares dates but has the [[Year 2000 problem|millennium bug]]. This bug resulted from programmers who represented dates with only the last two digits of the year. So any dates beyond 2000 would be misleadingly treated as earlier than those in the late twentieth century. Thus the Goodman agent was an ethical impact agent before 2000, and an unethical impact agent thereafter.\n*'''Implicit ethical agents''': For the consideration of human [[safety]], these agents are programmed to have a [[fail-safe]], or a built-in virtue. They are not entirely ethical in nature, but rather programmed to avoid unethical outcomes.\n*'''Explicit ethical agents''': These are machines that are capable of processing scenarios and acting on ethical decisions. Machines which have algorithms to act ethically.\n*'''Full ethical agents''': These machines are similar to explicit ethical agents in being able to make ethical decisions. However, they also contain human [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] features. (i.e. have [[free will]], [[consciousness]] and [[intentionality]])\n(See [[Moral responsibility#Artificial systems|artificial systems and moral responsibility]].)\n\n==Focuses of machine ethics==\n\n=== AI control problem ===\n{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|AI control problem}}\n\nSome scholars, such as philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] and AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]], argue that if AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes \"[[superintelligence|superintelligent]]\", then this new superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control: just as the fate of the [[mountain gorilla]] depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence.<ref name=\"superintelligence\">{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|author-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|date=2014|isbn=978-0199678112|edition=First|title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies}}</ref>  In their respective books ''[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|Superintelligence]]'' and ''[[Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control|Human Compatible]]'', both scholars assert that while there is much uncertainty regarding the future of AI, the risk to humanity is great enough to merit significant action in the present.\n\nThis presents the [[AI control problem]]: how to build an intelligent agent that will aid its creators, while avoiding inadvertently building a superintelligence that will harm its creators. The danger of not designing control right \"the first time,\" is that a superintelligence may be able to seize power over its environment and prevent humans from shutting it down. Potential AI control strategies include \"capability control\" (limiting an AI's ability to influence the world) and \"motivational control\" (building an AI whose goals are aligned with human values).  There are a number of organizations researching the AI control problem, including the [[Future of Humanity Institute]], the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], the [[Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence]], and the [[Future of Life Institute]].\n\n===Algorithms and training===\n\nAI paradigms have been debated over, especially in relation to their efficacy and bias. [[Nick Bostrom]] and [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] have argued for [[decision trees]] (such as [[ID3 algorithm|ID3]]) over [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and [[Genetic algorithm|genetic algorithms]] on the grounds that decision trees obey modern social norms of transparency and predictability (e.g. ''[[stare decisis]]'').<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf | title= The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence | first1= Nick | last1= Bostrom | authorlink1= Nick Bostrom | first2= Eliezer | last2= Yudkowsky | authorlink2= Eliezer Yudkowsky | year= 2011 | work= Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intelligence | publisher= [[Cambridge Press]] | access-date= 2011-06-28 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304015020/http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf | archive-date= 2016-03-04 | url-status= dead }}</ref> In contrast, Chris Santos-Lang argued in favor of neural networks and genetic algorithms on the grounds that the norms of any age must be allowed to change and that natural failure to fully satisfy these particular norms has been essential in making humans less vulnerable than machines to criminal \"[[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]]\".<ref name=\"SantosLang2002\">{{cite web | url= http://knol.google.com/k/chris-santos-lang/ethics-for-artificial-intelligences/3iue30fi4gfq9/1 | title= Ethics for Artificial Intelligences | first= Chris | last= Santos-Lang | year= 2002 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111203030304/http://knol.google.com/k/chris-santos-lang/ethics-for-artificial-intelligences/3iue30fi4gfq9/1 | archivedate= 2011-12-03 }}</ref><ref name=\"SantosLang2014\">{{cite book |last=Santos-Lang |first=Christopher | year=2014 |editor1-first=Simon |editor1-last=van Rysewyk  |editor2-first=Matthijs |editor2-last=Pontier |title=Machine Medical Ethics |volume=74 |publisher=Springer | location=Switzerland | pages=111\u2013127 | chapter=Moral Ecology Approaches to Machine Ethics| chapter-url=http://grinfree.com/MoralEcology.pdf | doi=10.1007/978-3-319-08108-3_8|series=Intelligent Systems, Control and Automation: Science and Engineering |isbn=978-3-319-08107-6 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, in an experiment at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems in the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne|Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale]] of [[Lausanne]] in [[Switzerland]], AI robots were programmed to cooperate with each other and tasked with the goal of searching for a beneficial resource while avoiding a poisonous resource.<ref>[http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-08/evolving-robots-learn-lie-hide-resources-each-other Evolving Robots Learn To Lie To Each Other], Popular Science, August 18, 2009</ref> During the experiment, the robots were grouped into clans, and the successful members' digital genetic code was used for the next generation, a type of algorithm known as a [[genetic algorithm]].

They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons.

Thus, as computers and robots become more and more intelligent, it becomes imperative that we think carefully and explicitly about what those built-in values are.

Moor]], one of the pioneering theoreticians in the field of [[computer ethics]], defines four kinds of ethical robots. As an extensive researcher on the studies of [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of science]], and [[logic]], Moor defines machines to be ethical impact agents, implicit ethical agents, explicit ethical agents, or full ethical agents. A machine can be more than one type of agent.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moor |first1=James M. |title=Four Kinds of Ethical Robots |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/72/Four_Kinds_of_Ethical_Robots |website=Philosophy Now |date=2009}}</ref>\n*'''Ethical impact agents''': These are machine systems that carry an ethical impact whether intended or not. At the same time, these agents have the potential to act unethical. Moor gives a hypothetical example called the 'Goodman agent', named after philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]]. The Goodman agent compares dates but has the [[Year 2000 problem|millennium bug]]. This bug resulted from programmers who represented dates with only the last two digits of the year. So any dates beyond 2000 would be misleadingly treated as earlier than those in the late twentieth century. Thus the Goodman agent was an ethical impact agent before 2000, and an unethical impact agent thereafter.\n*'''Implicit ethical agents''': For the consideration of human [[safety]], these agents are programmed to have a [[fail-safe]], or a built-in virtue. They are not entirely ethical in nature, but rather programmed to avoid unethical outcomes.\n*'''Explicit ethical agents''': These are machines that are capable of processing scenarios and acting on ethical decisions. Machines which have algorithms to act ethically.\n*'''Full ethical agents''': These machines are similar to explicit ethical agents in being able to make ethical decisions. However, they also contain human [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] features. (i.e. have [[free will]], [[consciousness]] and [[intentionality]])\n(See [[Moral responsibility#Artificial systems|artificial systems and moral responsibility]].)\n\n==Focuses of machine ethics==\n\n=== AI control problem ===\n{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|AI control problem}}\n\nSome scholars, such as philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] and AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]], argue that if AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes \"[[superintelligence|superintelligent]]\", then this new superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control: just as the fate of the [[mountain gorilla]] depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence.<ref name=\"superintelligence\">{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|author-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|date=2014|isbn=978-0199678112|edition=First|title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies}}</ref>  In their respective books ''[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|Superintelligence]]'' and ''[[Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control|Human Compatible]]'', both scholars assert that while there is much uncertainty regarding the future of AI, the risk to humanity is great enough to merit significant action in the present.\n\nThis presents the [[AI control problem]]: how to build an intelligent agent that will aid its creators, while avoiding inadvertently building a superintelligence that will harm its creators. The danger of not designing control right \"the first time,\" is that a superintelligence may be able to seize power over its environment and prevent humans from shutting it down. Potential AI control strategies include \"capability control\" (limiting an AI's ability to influence the world) and \"motivational control\" (building an AI whose goals are aligned with human values).  There are a number of organizations researching the AI control problem, including the [[Future of Humanity Institute]], the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], the [[Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence]], and the [[Future of Life Institute]].\n\n===Algorithms and training===\n\nAI paradigms have been debated over, especially in relation to their efficacy and bias. [[Nick Bostrom]] and [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] have argued for [[decision trees]] (such as [[ID3 algorithm|ID3]]) over [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and [[Genetic algorithm|genetic algorithms]] on the grounds that decision trees obey modern social norms of transparency and predictability (e.g. ''[[stare decisis]]'').<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf | title= The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence | first1= Nick | last1= Bostrom | authorlink1= Nick Bostrom | first2= Eliezer | last2= Yudkowsky | authorlink2= Eliezer Yudkowsky | year= 2011 | work= Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intelligence | publisher= [[Cambridge Press]] | access-date= 2011-06-28 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304015020/http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf | archive-date= 2016-03-04 | url-status= dead }}</ref> In contrast, Chris Santos-Lang argued in favor of neural networks and genetic algorithms on the grounds that the norms of any age must be allowed to change and that natural failure to fully satisfy these particular norms has been essential in making humans less vulnerable than machines to criminal \"[[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]]\".<ref name=\"SantosLang2002\">{{cite web | url= http://knol.google.com/k/chris-santos-lang/ethics-for-artificial-intelligences/3iue30fi4gfq9/1 | title= Ethics for Artificial Intelligences | first= Chris | last= Santos-Lang | year= 2002 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111203030304/http://knol.google.com/k/chris-santos-lang/ethics-for-artificial-intelligences/3iue30fi4gfq9/1 | archivedate= 2011-12-03 }}</ref><ref name=\"SantosLang2014\">{{cite book |last=Santos-Lang |first=Christopher | year=2014 |editor1-first=Simon |editor1-last=van Rysewyk  |editor2-first=Matthijs |editor2-last=Pontier |title=Machine Medical Ethics |volume=74 |publisher=Springer | location=Switzerland | pages=111\u2013127 | chapter=Moral Ecology Approaches to Machine Ethics| chapter-url=http://grinfree.com/MoralEcology.pdf | doi=10.1007/978-3-319-08108-3_8|series=Intelligent Systems, Control and Automation: Science and Engineering |isbn=978-3-319-08107-6 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, in an experiment at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems in the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne|Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale]] of [[Lausanne]] in [[Switzerland]], AI robots were programmed to cooperate with each other and tasked with the goal of searching for a beneficial resource while avoiding a poisonous resource.<ref>[http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-08/evolving-robots-learn-lie-hide-resources-each-other Evolving Robots Learn To Lie To Each Other], Popular Science, August 18, 2009</ref> During the experiment, the robots were grouped into clans, and the successful members' digital genetic code was used for the next generation, a type of algorithm known as a [[genetic algorithm]]. After 50 successive generations in the AI, one clan's members discovered how to distinguish the beneficial resource from the poisonous one. The robots then learned to lie to each other in an attempt to hoard the beneficial resource from other robots.<ref>Evolving Robots Learn To Lie To Each Other, Popular Science, August 18, 2009</ref>  In the same experiment, the same AI robots also learned to behave selflessly and signaled danger to other robots, and also died at the cost to save other robots.<ref>Santos-Lang, Chris (2002). \"Ethics for Artificial Intelligences\".

They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons.

They must make visible avenues for redress for those affected by disparate impacts, and establish processes for the timely redress of any discriminatory outputs.\n\nIn January 2020, Harvard University's [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society|Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society]] published a meta-study of 36 prominent sets of principles for AI, identifying eight key themes: privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fjeld|first=Jessica|last2=Achten|first2=Nele|last3=Hilligoss|first3=Hannah|last4=Nagy|first4=Adam|last5=Srikumar|first5=Madhulika|date=2020|title=Principled Artificial Intelligence: Mapping Consensus in Ethical and Rights-Based Approaches to Principles for AI|journal=SSRN Working Paper Series|doi=10.2139/ssrn.3518482|issn=1556-5068}}</ref> A similar meta-study was conducted by researchers from the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich]] in 2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jobin|first=Anna|last2=Ienca|first2=Marcello|last3=Vayena|first3=Effy|date=2019|title=The global landscape of AI ethics guidelines|journal=Nature Machine Intelligence|volume=1|issue=9|pages=389\u2013399|doi=10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2|issn=2522-5839}}</ref>\n\n===Approaches===\nSeveral attempts have been made to make ethics computable, or at least [[formal ethics|formal]].

This is called [[casuistry]] and it could be implemented through research on the internet. The consensus from a million past decisions would lead to a new decision that is democracy dependent. This could, however, lead to decisions that reflect biases and unethical behaviors exhibited in society.

At the insistence of his editor [[John W. Campbell Jr.]], he proposed the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] to govern artificially intelligent systems.
