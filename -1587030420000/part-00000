{"title_page": "Cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n\nA cricket tournament, played as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics, took place on 19\u201320 August at the V\u00e9lodrome de Vincennes.  The only match of the tournament was played between teams representing Great Britain and France, and was won by 158 runs by Great Britain.\n\nOriginally, teams representing Belgium, France, Great Britain, and the Netherlands were scheduled to compete in the tournament.  Belgium and the Netherlands pulled out of the competition, leaving Great Britain to play France. Neither team was nationally selected. The British side was a touring club, the Devon and Somerset Wanderers (alias ''Devon County Wanderers''), while the French team, the French Athletic Club Union, comprised mainly British  expatriates living in Paris.\n\nThe two-day game commenced on 19 August 1900. Great Britain batted first and scored 117, and bowled France out for 78. Great Britain then scored 145 for 5 in their second innings, setting the hosts a target of 185. The tourists bowled out France for 26 to win the match by 158 runs, a significant margin, but with only five minutes of the match remaining.  The Great Britain team was awarded silver medals and the French team bronze medals, together with miniature statues of the Eiffel Tower. The match was formally recognised as being an Olympic contest in 1912, and the medals were later reassigned as gold and silver.\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Cricket 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Poster of the only Olympic cricket match]]\n[[Cricket]] had been scheduled as an event at the first modern Olympics, the [[1896 Summer Olympics]], being listed in the original programme for the [[Athens]] Games.  Due to an insufficient number of entries, the event was cancelled.  Four years later, at the Paris Games, there was also a shortage of entries.<ref name=\"isoh\">{{cite journal |last=Buchanan |first=Ian |year=1993 |title=Cricket at the 1900 Games |journal=Journal of Olympic History |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=4 |publisher=[[International Society of Olympic Historians]] |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv1n2/JOHv1n2c.pdf |editor1-first=Bill |editor1-last=Mallon}}</ref>  [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], who for a time had been considered as possibilities to co-host the Olympics with France, withdrew from the cricket tournament when their co-hosting bids fell through.  Their withdrawal left only Great Britain and the host nation, France.<ref name=\"ignor\"/>\n\nThe slightly haphazard nature of the cricket tournament was mirrored throughout the rest of the 1900 Olympics. Events took place throughout a six-month period from May through until October, and like the Games themselves, were often considered part of the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]], a [[world's fair]] held in Paris from 15 April until 12 November 1900.<ref name=\"ignor\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/134962.html |title=The ignorant Olympians |last=Williamson |first=Martin |date=9 August 2008 |work=[[Cricinfo]] |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=4 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Team selection==\nNeither side was nationally selected, nor representative.  Great Britain, or England as they were called in the advertising handbills, were represented by a touring club side, the Devon and Somerset Wanderers. The side, formed by [[William Donne]] in 1894 for a tour of the [[Isle of Wight]], had completed five other tours before travelling to France.  The Wanderers were primarily formed from players of Castle Cary Cricket Club, five of whom played in the match, and also included four former pupils of [[Blundell's School]], a public school in Devon.  The side was completed by a number of players from the surrounding areas who were able to get away from business and personal commitments for the two-week period of the tour.<ref name=\"isoh\"/>  Writing in the Journal of Olympic History, Ian Buchanan describes that both sides \"were made up of distinctly average club cricketers\". Only two members of the Wanderers side, and none of the French side, played [[first-class cricket]].  [[Montagu Toller]] played six times for [[Somerset County Cricket Club]], all in 1897, while [[Alfred Bowerman]] played for Somerset once in 1900, and again in 1905.<ref name=\"isoh\"/>\n\nThe French side was officially drawn from all the member clubs of the [[Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques]].  Few of these clubs actually sported cricket teams, and so the eventual side was selected from just two clubs: the Union Club and the Standard Athletic Club.  Both sides had strong English influences, and the majority of the team that competed for France in the Olympic match were British [[expatriates]].  The Standard Athletic Club had been formed ten years earlier by English workers who had moved to the country to help build the [[Eiffel Tower]].<ref name=\"isoh\"/>\n\n==Match==\n\n===Summary===\n[[Image:Velodrome de Vincennes.jpg|thumb|250px|The venue of the match, [[V\u00e9lodrome de Vincennes]], at the 1900 Summer Olympics.]]\nThe match had been intended to be a standard eleven-a-side contest, but by mutual agreement from the captains this was increased to twelve-a-side, a move which the scorecard printers had not expected, resulting in the extra name having to be added by hand.<ref name=\"ignor\"/>  Play commenced at 11:00AM on Sunday, 19 August with the touring Wanderers batting first.<ref name=\"isoh\"/>  They were bowled out for 117, with only four members of the team reaching double figures.  [[Frederick Cuming]], one of the four Old Blundellians, top-scored for the side with 38, followed by their captain, and Exeter Cricket Club opening batsman, [[C. B. K. Beachcroft]] with 23.  The French were then bowled out for 78, the bowling led by [[Frederick Christian (cricketer)|Frederick Christian]] who claimed seven wickets.<ref name=\"ignor\"/> Play closed at 5:00PM after both sides had completed their first innings, and the Wanderers had a lead of 39 runs.  The Wanderers batting improved the following morning, and they added 145 runs for the second innings, [[Declaration and forfeiture|declaring]] their innings closed with five wickets down.  Beachcroft was again successful, reaching a half-century, a feat also achieved by Bowerman, who top-scored with 59 runs.  The French required 185 runs to win, but lost their first ten wickets for eleven runs.  At this point they attempted to play out time, which would have meant the match was drawn.  They succeeded for a time, and the match was just five minutes from the end when their eleventh, and final, wicket fell, granting the Wanderers a 158-run victory.  Toller was the pick of the Wanderers bowlers in the second innings, claiming seven wickets and conceding nine runs.<ref name=\"isoh\"/>\n\nAfter the match, the English side were awarded Silver medals, and the French side were given Bronze medals, and both teams were also given miniature statues of the Eiffel Tower.  The match was not covered in any national newspapers in England or France, although some of the local [[Devon]] and [[West Country]] newspapers did publish reports.<ref name=\"ignor\"/>\n\n===Scorecard===\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"border:gray solid 1px; text-align:center; width:80%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!| {{flag|Great Britain}}\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:37.5%;\"| First innings\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:37.5%;\"| Second innings\n|-\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| [[Batsman]]\n!

Great Britain batted first and scored 117, and bowled France out for 78. Great Britain then scored 145 for 5 in their second innings, setting the hosts a target of 185. The tourists bowled out France for 26 to win the match by 158 runs, a significant margin, but with only five minutes of the match remaining.  The Great Britain team was awarded silver medals and the French team bronze medals, together with miniature statues of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. The match was formally recognised as being an Olympic contest in 1912, and the medals were later reassigned as [[Gold medal|gold]] and [[Silver medal|silver]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Cricket 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Poster of the only Olympic cricket match]]\n[[Cricket]] had been scheduled as an event at the first modern Olympics, the [[1896 Summer Olympics]], being listed in the original programme for the [[Athens]] Games.  Due to an insufficient number of entries, the event was cancelled.  Four years later, at the Paris Games, there was also a shortage of entries.<ref name=\"isoh\">{{cite journal |last=Buchanan |first=Ian |year=1993 |title=Cricket at the 1900 Games |journal=Journal of Olympic History |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=4 |publisher=[[International Society of Olympic Historians]] |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv1n2/JOHv1n2c.pdf |editor1-first=Bill |editor1-last=Mallon}}</ref>  [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], who for a time had been considered as possibilities to co-host the Olympics with France, withdrew from the cricket tournament when their co-hosting bids fell through.  Their withdrawal left only Great Britain and the host nation, France.<ref name=\"ignor\"/>\n\nThe slightly haphazard nature of the cricket tournament was mirrored throughout the rest of the 1900 Olympics. Events took place throughout a six-month period from May through until October, and like the Games themselves, were often considered part of the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]], a [[world's fair]] held in Paris from 15 April until 12 November 1900.<ref name=\"ignor\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/134962.html |title=The ignorant Olympians |last=Williamson |first=Martin |date=9 August 2008 |work=[[Cricinfo]] |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=4 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Team selection==\nNeither side was nationally selected, nor representative.  Great Britain, or England as they were called in the advertising handbills, were represented by a touring club side, the Devon and Somerset Wanderers. The side, formed by [[William Donne]] in 1894 for a tour of the [[Isle of Wight]], had completed five other tours before travelling to France.  The Wanderers were primarily formed from players of Castle Cary Cricket Club, five of whom played in the match, and also included four former pupils of [[Blundell's School]], a public school in Devon.  The side was completed by a number of players from the surrounding areas who were able to get away from business and personal commitments for the two-week period of the tour.<ref name=\"isoh\"/>  Writing in the Journal of Olympic History, Ian Buchanan describes that both sides \"were made up of distinctly average club cricketers\". Only two members of the Wanderers side, and none of the French side, played [[first-class cricket]].  [[Montagu Toller]] played six times for [[Somerset County Cricket Club]], all in 1897, while [[Alfred Bowerman]] played for Somerset once in 1900, and again in 1905.<ref name=\"isoh\"/>\n\nThe French side was officially drawn from all the member clubs of the [[Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques]].  Few of these clubs actually sported cricket teams, and so the eventual side was selected from just two clubs: the Union Club and the Standard Athletic Club.  Both sides had strong English influences, and the majority of the team that competed for France in the Olympic match were British [[expatriates]].  The Standard Athletic Club had been formed ten years earlier by English workers who had moved to the country to help build the [[Eiffel Tower]].<ref name=\"isoh\"/>\n\n==Match==\n\n===Summary===\n[[Image:Velodrome de Vincennes.jpg|thumb|250px|The venue of the match, [[V\u00e9lodrome de Vincennes]], at the 1900 Summer Olympics.]]\nThe match had been intended to be a standard eleven-a-side contest, but by mutual agreement from the captains this was increased to twelve-a-side, a move which the scorecard printers had not expected, resulting in the extra name having to be added by hand.<ref name=\"ignor\"/>  Play commenced at 11:00AM on Sunday, 19 August with the touring Wanderers batting first.<ref name=\"isoh\"/>  They were bowled out for 117, with only four members of the team reaching double figures.  [[Frederick Cuming]], one of the four Old Blundellians, top-scored for the side with 38, followed by their captain, and Exeter Cricket Club opening batsman, [[C. B. K. Beachcroft]] with 23.  The French were then bowled out for 78, the bowling led by [[Frederick Christian (cricketer)|Frederick Christian]] who claimed seven wickets.<ref name=\"ignor\"/> Play closed at 5:00PM after both sides had completed their first innings, and the Wanderers had a lead of 39 runs.  The Wanderers batting improved the following morning, and they added 145 runs for the second innings, [[Declaration and forfeiture|declaring]] their innings closed with five wickets down.  Beachcroft was again successful, reaching a half-century, a feat also achieved by Bowerman, who top-scored with 59 runs.  The French required 185 runs to win, but lost their first ten wickets for eleven runs.  At this point they attempted to play out time, which would have meant the match was drawn.  They succeeded for a time, and the match was just five minutes from the end when their eleventh, and final, wicket fell, granting the Wanderers a 158-run victory.  Toller was the pick of the Wanderers bowlers in the second innings, claiming seven wickets and conceding nine runs.<ref name=\"isoh\"/>\n\nAfter the match, the English side were awarded Silver medals, and the French side were given Bronze medals, and both teams were also given miniature statues of the Eiffel Tower.  The match was not covered in any national newspapers in England or France, although some of the local [[Devon]] and [[West Country]] newspapers did publish reports.<ref name=\"ignor\"/>\n\n===Scorecard===\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"border:gray solid 1px; text-align:center; width:80%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!| {{flag|Great Britain}}\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:37.5%;\"| First innings\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:37.5%;\"| Second innings\n|-\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| [[Batsman]]\n!

The club played at its own rink, the [[Victoria Skating Rink (Montreal)|Victoria Skating Rink]] in Montreal. The club was winners of the [[Stanley Cup]] in 1895 and held it until 1899, except for a period in 1896. The club remained amateur, splitting from the ranks of teams turned professional in 1908. The amateur hockey club was the first winner of the [[Allan Cup]] and continued to play until 1939, when it folded after its 65th season.<ref name=\"Montreal Gazette Dec 31 1939\"/> The club often also fielded junior and intermediate teams.\n\n==Team history==\nInterest in ice hockey at the Victoria Skating Club in Montreal, dates to at least 1874, and is attributed to the efforts of [[James George Aylwin Creighton|James Creighton]] then a judge of skating at the club, in organizing his friends to play on the rink with sticks and skates from his home province of [[Nova Scotia]]. In 1875, the [[First indoor ice hockey game|first recorded organized hockey game]] took place at its rink, the Victoria Skating Rink, which had opened in 1862, between skating club members and [[McGill University]] students. Until 1883, there was only exhibition matches against other teams in Montreal. Tournaments would begin in 1883 at the Montreal Winter Carnival.\n\nOn January 10, 1882, the Victoria Hockey Club held what was described as its 'first annual meeting', whereby it elected its president James G. Monk. Other directors included George W. Gardner as vice-president, secretary-treasurer was Charles Lamothe.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |title=A Hockey Club |date=January 11, 1882 |page=3}}</ref> Hockey was played with both balls and pucks during this period. According to McGill hockey club member W. L. Murray, by 1881 it was normally played with a square puck, made by slicing a rubber ball. According to Murray, the Victoria club of the 1880s is credited with eliminating the square edges and playing with a round puck.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |title=McGill Man Tells of How First Rules for Hockey Were Written |date=December 17, 1936 |page=17 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0b0tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oZgFAAAAIBAJ&dq=1883%20montreal%20winter%20carnival&pg=5799%2C2185856}}</ref>\n\nIn 1886, the club helped to found the [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]] (AHAC). The team played in this league from 1887-1898. It was during this period that the team had its greatest success, winning the [[Stanley Cup]] in 1895, December 1896, 1897, 1898 and February 1899. They also won the AHAC league in 1895, 1896, 1897 and 1898. In 1894, the team participated in the first [[Stanley Cup]] playoff, losing 3\u20132 to Montreal in the semi-final.\n\nThe team resigned from the AHAC in 1898 over the proposal to allow the [[Ottawa Capitals]] into the league, and helped form the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]] (CAHL) in which they played from 1899-1905. The CAHL itself folded in 1905 and the team helped found the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]]. The league allowed amateurs and professionals to play against each other openly. The Victorias played in the league for two years as a purely amateur team leaving the ECAHA after the 1908 season to focus on amateur play.\n\n[[Image:Montreal Victorias Hockey Club 1897.png|right|thumb|250px|[[Stanley Cup]] champions, 1897.<ref name=\"Farrell 1899\"/>]]\n\nIn 1908, the new [[Allan Cup]] was awarded to the Victorias as the top amateur team at the time. The Victorias remained active in senior-league amateur play in the [[Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union]] until 1913. From 1913\u20131923, the club was a member of the [[Montreal City Hockey League]]. The club then joined the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey League]]. Later the team played in the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association.\n\nIn 1924, as a part of a 50th anniversary, the Victorias played an exhibition match against the Parkdale Canoe Club of Toronto at the then-new [[Montreal Forum]]. The game was the first amateur ice hockey game at the new venue.

Its date of origin is ascribed to either 1874,<ref name=\"Montreal Gazette Dec 31 1939\">{{cite news \n |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=P3ktAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rpgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6698,5465943&dq=montreal+victorias+hockey&hl=en \n |work=Montreal Gazette \n |date=December 31, 1939\n |title=Casual Closeups\n |page=16\n |last=McNeil\n |first=Marc}}</ref> 1877<ref>{{cite news\n |work=The Globe\n |title=After the Puck\n |date=November 22, 1899\n |page=9}}</ref> or 1881, making it either the first or second organized ice hockey club after [[McGill Redmen|McGill University]]. The club played at its own rink, the [[Victoria Skating Rink (Montreal)|Victoria Skating Rink]] in Montreal. The club was winners of the [[Stanley Cup]] in 1895 and held it until 1899, except for a period in 1896. The club remained amateur, splitting from the ranks of teams turned professional in 1908. The amateur hockey club was the first winner of the [[Allan Cup]] and continued to play until 1939, when it folded after its 65th season.<ref name=\"Montreal Gazette Dec 31 1939\"/> The club often also fielded junior and intermediate teams.\n\n==Team history==\nInterest in ice hockey at the Victoria Skating Club in Montreal, dates to at least 1874, and is attributed to the efforts of [[James George Aylwin Creighton|James Creighton]] then a judge of skating at the club, in organizing his friends to play on the rink with sticks and skates from his home province of [[Nova Scotia]]. In 1875, the [[First indoor ice hockey game|first recorded organized hockey game]] took place at its rink, the Victoria Skating Rink, which had opened in 1862, between skating club members and [[McGill University]] students. Until 1883, there was only exhibition matches against other teams in Montreal. Tournaments would begin in 1883 at the Montreal Winter Carnival.\n\nOn January 10, 1882, the Victoria Hockey Club held what was described as its 'first annual meeting', whereby it elected its president James G. Monk. Other directors included George W. Gardner as vice-president, secretary-treasurer was Charles Lamothe.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |title=A Hockey Club |date=January 11, 1882 |page=3}}</ref> Hockey was played with both balls and pucks during this period. According to McGill hockey club member W. L. Murray, by 1881 it was normally played with a square puck, made by slicing a rubber ball. According to Murray, the Victoria club of the 1880s is credited with eliminating the square edges and playing with a round puck.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |title=McGill Man Tells of How First Rules for Hockey Were Written |date=December 17, 1936 |page=17 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0b0tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oZgFAAAAIBAJ&dq=1883%20montreal%20winter%20carnival&pg=5799%2C2185856}}</ref>\n\nIn 1886, the club helped to found the [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]] (AHAC). The team played in this league from 1887-1898. It was during this period that the team had its greatest success, winning the [[Stanley Cup]] in 1895, December 1896, 1897, 1898 and February 1899. They also won the AHAC league in 1895, 1896, 1897 and 1898. In 1894, the team participated in the first [[Stanley Cup]] playoff, losing 3\u20132 to Montreal in the semi-final.\n\nThe team resigned from the AHAC in 1898 over the proposal to allow the [[Ottawa Capitals]] into the league, and helped form the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]] (CAHL) in which they played from 1899-1905. The CAHL itself folded in 1905 and the team helped found the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association]]. The league allowed amateurs and professionals to play against each other openly. The Victorias played in the league for two years as a purely amateur team leaving the ECAHA after the 1908 season to focus on amateur play.\n\n[[Image:Montreal Victorias Hockey Club 1897.png|right|thumb|250px|[[Stanley Cup]] champions, 1897.<ref name=\"Farrell 1899\"/>]]\n\nIn 1908, the new [[Allan Cup]] was awarded to the Victorias as the top amateur team at the time. The Victorias remained active in senior-league amateur play in the [[Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union]] until 1913. From 1913\u20131923, the club was a member of the [[Montreal City Hockey League]]. The club then joined the [[Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey League]]. Later the team played in the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association.\n\nIn 1924, as a part of a 50th anniversary, the Victorias played an exhibition match against the Parkdale Canoe Club of Toronto at the then-new [[Montreal Forum]]. The game was the first amateur ice hockey game at the new venue. The game was held on December 13, 1924 and was a fund-raising event for the Club.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |title=Vics To Celebrate 50th Anniversary |date=November 22, 1924 |page=19}}</ref> The Victoria Skating Rink was closed in 1925<ref name=\"1925-sale\">{{cite news\n |work=Montreal Gazette\n |title=Victoria Skating Rink Property Sold\n |page=4 |date=September 5, 1925}}</ref> and the Victorias moved to [[Mount Royal Arena]] and the Forum.\n\nIn 1927, the Victorias became the first North American club team to tour in Europe.

In 1960, he teamed up with songwriters Bob Brass and [[Irwin Levine]] to write and record demos for Sea-Lark Music Publishing. The trio's biggest hits were \"[[This Diamond Ring]]\", recorded by [[Gary Lewis and the Playboys]], and \"[[I Must Be Seeing Things]]\", recorded by [[Gene Pitney]] (both 1965). When he was 21, Kooper moved to Manhattan's [[Greenwich Village]], then teeming with artists, writers, and musicians.\n\n===With Dylan===\nHe performed with [[Bob Dylan]] in concert in 1965, including playing [[Hammond organ]] with Dylan at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], and in the recording studio in 1965 and 1966. Kooper also played the Hammond organ riffs on Dylan's \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\". It was in those recording sessions that Kooper met and befriended [[Mike Bloomfield]], whose guitar playing he admired. He worked extensively with Bloomfield for several years. Kooper played organ once again with Dylan during his 1981 world tour.\n\n===Blues Project===\nKooper joined the [[The Blues Project|Blues Project]] as their keyboardist in 1965; he left the band shortly before their [[concert|gig]] at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967, although he did play a solo set at the famous festival, as evidenced by bootlegs of the event.

Reference to weaving and spinning materials is found in the [[Vedic Literature]]. There was textile trade in India during the early centuries. A block printed and resist-dyed fabric, whose origin is from [[Gujarat]] was found in the tombs of [[Fostat]], Egypt. This proves that Indian export of cotton textiles to Egypt or the Nile Civilization in medieval times were to a large extent. Large quantity of north Indian silk were traded through the [[silk route]] in China <ref>{{cite web|title=History of Textile|url=http://www.textileasart.com/weaving.htm}}</ref>  to the western countries.

The Celtics originally acquired the number one pick of the [[NBA draft]] due to a previous trade involving the [[Brooklyn Nets]], only to then trade it to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in exchange for two different draft picks. One of the picks would allow Boston to draft forward [[Jayson Tatum]]. Later, they acquired [[Gordon Hayward]] in free agency on July 7, 2017. They would also acquire [[Kyrie Irving]] from the [[2017-18 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]] via trade on August 22, 2017 in exchange for [[Ante \u017di\u017ei\u0107]], [[Jae Crowder]], All-Star point guard [[Isaiah Thomas (basketball)|Isaiah Thomas]], the [[Brooklyn Nets]]' unprotected first round pick in the [[2018 NBA draft]], and a 2020 second round pick, originally from the [[Miami Heat]]. The Celtics played the first game of the regular season on October 17, 2017, against the [[2017-18 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]].\n\nThe team retired the number 34 in honor of former small forward [[Paul Pierce]] on February 11, 2018, during a game against the Cavaliers, which ultimately didn't involve a conflict with both Isaiah Thomas and Jae Crowder returning that night, as they were traded to the [[2017\u201318 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[2017\u201318 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]] respectively during the NBA trade deadline. Neither Thomas nor Crowder would return to Boston during this season, as the Lakers and Jazz already played against the Celtics in Boston before the trade deadline.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Celtics defeated the 7th seeded [[2017-18 Milwaukee Bucks season|Milwaukee Bucks]] in the First Round in seven games, advancing to the Semifinals, where they faced the [[2017\u201318 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]], winning in five games, advancing to the Conference Finals, where they faced the [[2017\u201318 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]] in a rematch of last season's Eastern Conference Finals, in which the Cavaliers won 4\u20133. Despite losing both star acquisitions [[Gordon Hayward]] and [[Kyrie Irving]] before the playoffs began to season-ending injuries, the Celtics would make this series more hard-fought this time (each game ending with no longer than a deficit of 8 points), but lost in seven games to the Cavaliers, losing 79\u201387 at home in Game 7. It marks the first time since the [[1987\u201388 Boston Celtics season|1987\u201388 season]] that the Celtics made two consecutive Conference Finals.\n\n==Draft picks==\n{{main|2017 NBA draft}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n! style=\"background:#008040; color:white\" width=\"10%\"| Round\n! style=\"background:#008040; color:white\" width=\"10%\"| Pick\n! style=\"background:#008040; color:white\" width=\"20%\"| Player\n! style=\"background:#008040; color:white\" width=\"15%\"| Position\n! style=\"background:#008040; color:white\" width=\"15%\"| Nationality\n! style=\"background:#008040; color:white\" width=\"20%\"| College\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 1\n| 3\n| [[Jayson Tatum]]\n| SF\n| {{flagu|United States}}\n| [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 2\n| 37\n| [[Semi Ojeleye]]\n| PF\n| {{flagu|United States}}\n| [[SMU Mustangs men's basketball|Southern Methodist]]\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 2\n| 53\n| [[Kadeem Allen]]\n| PG\n| {{flagu|United States}}\n| [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]]\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 2\n| 56\n| [[Jabari Bird]]\n| SG\n| {{flagu|United States}}\n| [[California Golden Bears men's basketball|California]]\n|}\n\nDespite having the best record in the Eastern Conference the previous season, the Celtics would originally win the number one pick at the end of the year because they activated the right to swap their own first-round draft pick (which was pick number 27) with the [[Brooklyn Nets]], who held the worst record of the entire NBA that same season. (The Nets struggled in part because of a previous, infamous trade with the Celtics, that swapped role players [[Jason Terry]] and [[D.J. White]] and superstars [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[Paul Pierce]] for other players and draft picks, including the right to swap first round picks in the 2017 NBA draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/press_release/celtics-complete-trade-brooklyn-nets|title=Celtics Complete Trade With Brooklyn Nets|date=July 12, 2013|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref>) However, on June 19, four days before the [[2017 NBA draft]] commenced, the Celtics would trade that coveted pick to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in exchange for the third pick of the draft (which was projected to be a small forward in either [[Josh Jackson (basketball)|Josh Jackson]] or [[Jayson Tatum]] by that point) and either the [[Sacramento Kings]] or [[Philadelphia 76ers]]' 2019 first round pick, depending on what happens in that year's draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.celticsblog.com/2017/6/19/15831962/nba-draft-celtics-officially-trade-number-one-pick-to-76ers-philadelphia-boston-fultz-tatum|title=NBA Draft: Celtics officially trade number-one pick to 76ers|publisher=|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> Other than that, the Celtics also hold three second round draft picks, each of which were acquired by trades, while losing their own second round pick as an added piece of help for the Nets later on down the line.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nets Draft Picture: Brooklyn has picks, just not a lot of them|url=http://www.netsdaily.com/2017/5/16/15646548/nets-draft-picture-brooklyn-does-have-picks-just-not-a-lot-of-them|website=SBNation|publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc.]]|accessdate=May 18, 2017|date=May 16, 2017}}</ref> Their first second round pick was acquired from the [[Phoenix Suns]] back when it was considered a first round pick from the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in exchange for [[Brandan Wright]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Aldridge|first1=David|title=Suns bolster frontline with acquisition of Wright|url=http://www.nba.com/2015/news/features/david_aldridge/01/09/suns-acquire-brandan-wright/|website=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|accessdate=May 28, 2017|date=January 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702021919/http://www.nba.com/2015/news/features/david_aldridge/01/09/suns-acquire-brandan-wright/|archive-date=July 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The next second round pick was had from the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] alongside their 2016 second round pick and [[Keith Bogans]] in exchange for [[John Lucas III]], [[Erik Murphy]], [[Dwight Powell]], [[Malcolm Thomas (basketball, born 1988)|Malcolm Thomas]], and the protected rights of the [[Sacramento Kings]]' own second round picks from both 2015 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cavs Complete Trade with Boston|url=http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/releases/boston-trade-140925|website=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|accessdate=May 30, 2017|date=September 25, 2014}}</ref> Finally, their last second round pick was acquired from the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] in a three-way trade with the Phoenix Suns, where Boston would acquire [[Shavlik Randolph]] again and a trade exception from the Suns, as well as both [[Chris Douglas-Roberts]] and a second round pick from the Clippers.</small><ref>{{cite web|title=LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS ACQUIRE AUSTIN RIVERS IN THREE-TEAM TRADE|url=http://www.nba.com/clippers/clippers-acquire-austin-rivers-three-team-trade/|website=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|accessdate=June 29, 2017|date=January 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWith their top pick (and the one that [[Danny Ainge]] claimed would have taken as the number one pick instead of [[Markelle Fultz]]<ref>https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/celtics-gm-danny-ainge-on-jayson-tatum-we-would-have-picked-him-with-first-pick/</ref>), the Boston Celtics selected a 19-year-old freshman, small forward [[Jayson Tatum]], of [[Duke University]]. In his only season at Duke, Jayson averaged 16.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.3 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game in over 29 games there, while also earning All-[[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Freshman Team and All-ACC Third Team honors throughout last season. Tatum would end the season as a near-unanimous [[NBA All-Rookie Team|NBA All-Rookie First Team]] member. In terms of their second round picks, the first one they took would be another small forward, this time being [[Semi Ojeleye]], a transfer junior from [[Southern Methodist University]] (previously from [[Duke University]] as well). During his only year at Southern Methodist, Ojeleye helped lead the Mustangs to their second ever [[American Athletic Conference|AAC]] Tournament victory by recording averages of 18.9 points and 6.8 rebounds per game there. As a result of his efforts, he became the AAC Tournament's MVP that year, as well as be named to the All-AAC First Team, the AAC Player of The Year, and was an honorable mention via the [[Associated Press]] for the NCAA All-American Team. For the second of Boston's three second round picks, at number 53, the Celtics selected senior shooting guard [[Kadeem Allen]] from [[University of Arizona]]. In his senior year at Arizona, he averaged 9.8 points and 4 rebounds per game, which would be enough for him to be named a member of the [[Pac-12]] Second Team and Pac-12 Defensive Team. Finally, with their last second round pick at number 56, Boston chose another senior shooting guard, this time being [[Jabari Bird]] from the [[University of California]]. During his last season at California, Bird averaged 14.3 points and 4.3 rebounds for the Golden Bears, but he suffered a concussion during one of his last games there. Both [[Kadeem Allen]] and [[Jabari Bird]] would become the team's first ever players to sign [[two-way contract]]s with the team, meaning they get to split their playing time for at least this season between the Celtics and their [[NBA G League]] affiliate, the [[Maine Red Claws]], with Maine holding them for the majority of this season as a result of the two-way contract's stipulations.\n\n==Roster==\n{{NBA roster header|team=Boston Celtics|season=2017\u201318}}\n<!-- list of players -->\n{{player2 | num = 45 | first = Kadeem | last = Allen | pos = G | ft = 6 | in = 3 | lbs = 200 | college = Arizona | DOB = 1993\u201301\u201315 | note = TW }}\n{{player2 | num = 46 | first = Aron | last = Baynes | pos = C | ft = 6 | in = 10 | lbs = 260 | college = Washington State | DOB = 1986\u201312\u201309 | inj = yes}}\n{{player2 | num = 26 | first = Jabari | last = Bird | pos = G | ft = 6 | in = 6 | lbs = 198 | college = California | DOB = 1994\u201307\u201303 | note = TW }} \n{{player2 | num = 7 | first = Jaylen | last = Brown | pos = GF | ft = 6 | in = 7 | lbs = 225 | college = California | DOB = 1996\u201310\u201324 }}\n{{player2 | num = 20 | first = Gordon | last = Hayward | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 8 | lbs = 226 | college = Butler | DOB = 1990\u201303\u201323 | inj = yes }}\n{{player2 | num = 42 | first = Al | last = Horford | pos = FC | ft = 6 | in = 10 | lbs = 250 | college = Florida | DOB = 1986\u201306\u201303 }}\n{{player2 | num = 11 | first = Kyrie | last = Irving | pos = G | ft = 6 | in = 3 | lbs = 193 | college = Duke | DOB = 1992\u201303\u201323 | inj = yes}}\n{{player2 | num = 8 | first = Shane | last = Larkin | pos = G | ft = 5 | in = 11 | lbs = 175 | college = Miami (FL) | DOB = 1992\u201310\u201302 | inj = yes }}\n{{player2 | num = 55 | first = Greg | last = Monroe | pos = C | ft = 6 | in = 11 | lbs = 265 | college = Georgetown | DOB = 1990\u201306\u201304 }}\n{{player2 | num = 13 | first = Marcus | last = Morris | dab = basketball | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 10 | lbs = 235 | college = Kansas | DOB = 1989\u201309\u201302 }}\n{{player2 | num = 28 | first = Abdel | last = Nader | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 6 | lbs = 230 | college = Iowa State | DOB = 1993\u201309\u201325 }}\n{{player2 | num = 37 | first = Semi | last = Ojeleye | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 7 | lbs = 235 | college = Southern Methodist | DOB = 1994\u201312\u201305 }}\n{{player2 | num = 12 | first = Terry | last = Rozier | pos = G | ft = 6 | in = 2 | lbs = 190 | college = Louisville | DOB = 1994\u201303\u201317 }}\n{{player2 | num = 36 | first = Marcus | last = Smart | pos = G | ft = 6 | in = 4 | lbs = 220 | college = Oklahoma State | DOB = 1994\u201303\u201306 }}\n{{player2 | num = 0 | first = Jayson | last = Tatum | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 8 | lbs = 205 | college = Duke | DOB = 1998\u201303\u201303 }}\n{{player2 | num = 27 | first = Daniel | last = Theis | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 9 | lbs = 243 | from = Germany | DOB = 1992\u201304\u201304 | inj = yes }}\n{{player2 | num = 30 | first = Guerschon | last = Yabusele | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 8 | lbs = 260 | from = France | DOB = 1995\u201312\u201317 }}\n<!-- end list of players -->\n{{NBA roster footer\n| head_coach =\n* [[Brad Stevens]]\n| asst_coach =\n* [[Jerome Allen (basketball)|Jerome Allen]]\n* [[Jay Larra\u00f1aga]]\n* [[Scott Morrison (basketball coach)|Scott Morrison]]\n* [[Micah Shrewsberry]]\n* [[Jamie Young (basketball)|Jamie Young]]\n| otherlegend = '''(GL)''' On [[NBA G League#Player allocations|assignment]] to G League affiliate\n| otherlegend2 = '''(TW)''' Two-way affiliate player\n| roster_url = http://www.nba.com/celtics/roster/\n| transaction_url = http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/teams/Boston-Celtics/2/Transaction_History\n| accessdate = 2018\u201304\u201306\n}}\n\n==Standings==\n\n===Division===\n{{2017\u201318 NBA Atlantic standings|team=BOS}}\n\n===Conference===\n{{2017\u201318 NBA East standings|team=BOS}}\n\n==Game log==\n\n===Preseason===\n{{NBA game log start|Boston Celtics|pre-season=yes|end_year=2018|record=Total: 4\u20130 (Home: 2\u20130;

The Celtics originally acquired the number one pick of the [[NBA draft]] due to a previous trade involving the [[Brooklyn Nets]], only to then trade it to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in exchange for two different draft picks. One of the picks would allow Boston to draft forward [[Jayson Tatum]]. Later, they acquired [[Gordon Hayward]] in free agency on July 7, 2017. They would also acquire [[Kyrie Irving]] from the [[2017-18 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]] via trade on August 22, 2017 in exchange for [[Ante \u017di\u017ei\u0107]], [[Jae Crowder]], All-Star point guard [[Isaiah Thomas (basketball)|Isaiah Thomas]], the [[Brooklyn Nets]]' unprotected first round pick in the [[2018 NBA draft]], and a 2020 second round pick, originally from the [[Miami Heat]]. The Celtics played the first game of the regular season on October 17, 2017, against the [[2017-18 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]].\n\nThe team retired the number 34 in honor of former small forward [[Paul Pierce]] on February 11, 2018, during a game against the Cavaliers, which ultimately didn't involve a conflict with both Isaiah Thomas and Jae Crowder returning that night, as they were traded to the [[2017\u201318 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[2017\u201318 Utah Jazz season|Utah Jazz]] respectively during the NBA trade deadline. Neither Thomas nor Crowder would return to Boston during this season, as the Lakers and Jazz already played against the Celtics in Boston before the trade deadline.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Celtics defeated the 7th seeded [[2017-18 Milwaukee Bucks season|Milwaukee Bucks]] in the First Round in seven games, advancing to the Semifinals, where they faced the [[2017\u201318 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]], winning in five games, advancing to the Conference Finals, where they faced the [[2017\u201318 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]] in a rematch of last season's Eastern Conference Finals, in which the Cavaliers won 4\u20133. Despite losing both star acquisitions [[Gordon Hayward]] and [[Kyrie Irving]] before the playoffs began to season-ending injuries, the Celtics would make this series more hard-fought this time (each game ending with no longer than a deficit of 8 points), but lost in seven games to the Cavaliers, losing 79\u201387 at home in Game 7.

(The Nets struggled in part because of a previous, infamous trade with the Celtics, that swapped role players [[Jason Terry]] and [[D.J. White]] and superstars [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[Paul Pierce]] for other players and draft picks, including the right to swap first round picks in the 2017 NBA draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/press_release/celtics-complete-trade-brooklyn-nets|title=Celtics Complete Trade With Brooklyn Nets|date=July 12, 2013|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref>) However, on June 19, four days before the [[2017 NBA draft]] commenced, the Celtics would trade that coveted pick to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in exchange for the third pick of the draft (which was projected to be a small forward in either [[Josh Jackson (basketball)|Josh Jackson]] or [[Jayson Tatum]] by that point) and either the [[Sacramento Kings]] or [[Philadelphia 76ers]]' 2019 first round pick, depending on what happens in that year's draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.celticsblog.com/2017/6/19/15831962/nba-draft-celtics-officially-trade-number-one-pick-to-76ers-philadelphia-boston-fultz-tatum|title=NBA Draft: Celtics officially trade number-one pick to 76ers|publisher=|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> Other than that, the Celtics also hold three second round draft picks, each of which were acquired by trades, while losing their own second round pick as an added piece of help for the Nets later on down the line.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nets Draft Picture: Brooklyn has picks, just not a lot of them|url=http://www.netsdaily.com/2017/5/16/15646548/nets-draft-picture-brooklyn-does-have-picks-just-not-a-lot-of-them|website=SBNation|publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc.]]|accessdate=May 18, 2017|date=May 16, 2017}}</ref> Their first second round pick was acquired from the [[Phoenix Suns]] back when it was considered a first round pick from the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in exchange for [[Brandan Wright]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Aldridge|first1=David|title=Suns bolster frontline with acquisition of Wright|url=http://www.nba.com/2015/news/features/david_aldridge/01/09/suns-acquire-brandan-wright/|website=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|accessdate=May 28, 2017|date=January 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702021919/http://www.nba.com/2015/news/features/david_aldridge/01/09/suns-acquire-brandan-wright/|archive-date=July 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The next second round pick was had from the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] alongside their 2016 second round pick and [[Keith Bogans]] in exchange for [[John Lucas III]], [[Erik Murphy]], [[Dwight Powell]], [[Malcolm Thomas (basketball, born 1988)|Malcolm Thomas]], and the protected rights of the [[Sacramento Kings]]' own second round picks from both 2015 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cavs Complete Trade with Boston|url=http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/releases/boston-trade-140925|website=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|accessdate=May 30, 2017|date=September 25, 2014}}</ref> Finally, their last second round pick was acquired from the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] in a three-way trade with the Phoenix Suns, where Boston would acquire [[Shavlik Randolph]] again and a trade exception from the Suns, as well as both [[Chris Douglas-Roberts]] and a second round pick from the Clippers.</small><ref>{{cite web|title=LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS ACQUIRE AUSTIN RIVERS IN THREE-TEAM TRADE|url=http://www.nba.com/clippers/clippers-acquire-austin-rivers-three-team-trade/|website=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|accessdate=June 29, 2017|date=January 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWith their top pick (and the one that [[Danny Ainge]] claimed would have taken as the number one pick instead of [[Markelle Fultz]]<ref>https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/celtics-gm-danny-ainge-on-jayson-tatum-we-would-have-picked-him-with-first-pick/</ref>), the Boston Celtics selected a 19-year-old freshman, small forward [[Jayson Tatum]], of [[Duke University]]. In his only season at Duke, Jayson averaged 16.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.3 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game in over 29 games there, while also earning All-[[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Freshman Team and All-ACC Third Team honors throughout last season. Tatum would end the season as a near-unanimous [[NBA All-Rookie Team|NBA All-Rookie First Team]] member. In terms of their second round picks, the first one they took would be another small forward, this time being [[Semi Ojeleye]], a transfer junior from [[Southern Methodist University]] (previously from [[Duke University]] as well). During his only year at Southern Methodist, Ojeleye helped lead the Mustangs to their second ever [[American Athletic Conference|AAC]] Tournament victory by recording averages of 18.9 points and 6.8 rebounds per game there. As a result of his efforts, he became the AAC Tournament's MVP that year, as well as be named to the All-AAC First Team, the AAC Player of The Year, and was an honorable mention via the [[Associated Press]] for the NCAA All-American Team. For the second of Boston's three second round picks, at number 53, the Celtics selected senior shooting guard [[Kadeem Allen]] from [[University of Arizona]]. In his senior year at Arizona, he averaged 9.8 points and 4 rebounds per game, which would be enough for him to be named a member of the [[Pac-12]] Second Team and Pac-12 Defensive Team. Finally, with their last second round pick at number 56, Boston chose another senior shooting guard, this time being [[Jabari Bird]] from the [[University of California]]. During his last season at California, Bird averaged 14.3 points and 4.3 rebounds for the Golden Bears, but he suffered a concussion during one of his last games there. Both [[Kadeem Allen]] and [[Jabari Bird]] would become the team's first ever players to sign [[two-way contract]]s with the team, meaning they get to split their playing time for at least this season between the Celtics and their [[NBA G League]] affiliate, the [[Maine Red Claws]], with Maine holding them for the majority of this season as a result of the two-way contract's stipulations.\n\n==Roster==\n{{NBA roster header|team=Boston Celtics|season=2017\u201318}}\n<!-- list of players -->\n{{player2 | num = 45 | first = Kadeem | last = Allen | pos = G | ft = 6 | in = 3 | lbs = 200 | college = Arizona | DOB = 1993\u201301\u201315 | note = TW }}\n{{player2 | num = 46 | first = Aron | last = Baynes | pos = C | ft = 6 | in = 10 | lbs = 260 | college = Washington State | DOB = 1986\u201312\u201309 | inj = yes}}\n{{player2 | num = 26 | first = Jabari | last = Bird | pos = G | ft = 6 | in = 6 | lbs = 198 | college = California | DOB = 1994\u201307\u201303 | note = TW }} \n{{player2 | num = 7 | first = Jaylen | last = Brown | pos = GF | ft = 6 | in = 7 | lbs = 225 | college = California | DOB = 1996\u201310\u201324 }}\n{{player2 | num = 20 | first = Gordon | last = Hayward | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 8 | lbs = 226 | college = Butler | DOB = 1990\u201303\u201323 | inj = yes }}\n{{player2 | num = 42 | first = Al | last = Horford | pos = FC | ft = 6 | in = 10 | lbs = 250 | college = Florida | DOB = 1986\u201306\u201303 }}\n{{player2 | num = 11 | first = Kyrie | last = Irving | pos = G | ft = 6 | in = 3 | lbs = 193 | college = Duke | DOB = 1992\u201303\u201323 | inj = yes}}\n{{player2 | num = 8 | first = Shane | last = Larkin | pos = G | ft = 5 | in = 11 | lbs = 175 | college = Miami (FL) | DOB = 1992\u201310\u201302 | inj = yes }}\n{{player2 | num = 55 | first = Greg | last = Monroe | pos = C | ft = 6 | in = 11 | lbs = 265 | college = Georgetown | DOB = 1990\u201306\u201304 }}\n{{player2 | num = 13 | first = Marcus | last = Morris | dab = basketball | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 10 | lbs = 235 | college = Kansas | DOB = 1989\u201309\u201302 }}\n{{player2 | num = 28 | first = Abdel | last = Nader | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 6 | lbs = 230 | college = Iowa State | DOB = 1993\u201309\u201325 }}\n{{player2 | num = 37 | first = Semi | last = Ojeleye | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 7 | lbs = 235 | college = Southern Methodist | DOB = 1994\u201312\u201305 }}\n{{player2 | num = 12 | first = Terry | last = Rozier | pos = G | ft = 6 | in = 2 | lbs = 190 | college = Louisville | DOB = 1994\u201303\u201317 }}\n{{player2 | num = 36 | first = Marcus | last = Smart | pos = G | ft = 6 | in = 4 | lbs = 220 | college = Oklahoma State | DOB = 1994\u201303\u201306 }}\n{{player2 | num = 0 | first = Jayson | last = Tatum | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 8 | lbs = 205 | college = Duke | DOB = 1998\u201303\u201303 }}\n{{player2 | num = 27 | first = Daniel | last = Theis | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 9 | lbs = 243 | from = Germany | DOB = 1992\u201304\u201304 | inj = yes }}\n{{player2 | num = 30 | first = Guerschon | last = Yabusele | pos = F | ft = 6 | in = 8 | lbs = 260 | from = France | DOB = 1995\u201312\u201317 }}\n<!-- end list of players -->\n{{NBA roster footer\n| head_coach =\n* [[Brad Stevens]]\n| asst_coach =\n* [[Jerome Allen (basketball)|Jerome Allen]]\n* [[Jay Larra\u00f1aga]]\n* [[Scott Morrison (basketball coach)|Scott Morrison]]\n* [[Micah Shrewsberry]]\n* [[Jamie Young (basketball)|Jamie Young]]\n| otherlegend = '''(GL)''' On [[NBA G League#Player allocations|assignment]] to G League affiliate\n| otherlegend2 = '''(TW)''' Two-way affiliate player\n| roster_url = http://www.nba.com/celtics/roster/\n| transaction_url = http://basketball.realgm.com/nba/teams/Boston-Celtics/2/Transaction_History\n| accessdate = 2018\u201304\u201306\n}}\n\n==Standings==\n\n===Division===\n{{2017\u201318 NBA Atlantic standings|team=BOS}}\n\n===Conference===\n{{2017\u201318 NBA East standings|team=BOS}}\n\n==Game log==\n\n===Preseason===\n{{NBA game log start|Boston Celtics|pre-season=yes|end_year=2018|record=Total: 4\u20130 (Home: 2\u20130;
