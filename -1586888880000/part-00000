The film became a hit at the box office similar to the previous outing ''[[Malai Malai]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts with a flashback. ACP Bose ([[Karthik Muthuraman|Karthik]]) is a sincere police officer happily married. He lives with his parents and younger brother Velu ([[Arun Vijay]]). Velu is a college student, and he falls in love with his classmate Anjali ([[Dhansika]]). Enters Umapathi ([[Chandrasekar]]), the villain who is notorious for settlements and land deals. Anjali comes across Bose when she is on a field trip from her college with her friends. She gets friendly with his daughter Pinky, who tells her that she would get her introduced to her uncle Velu, and they would make a good pair. It turns out that Velu studies in Anjali's college and soon after, they come to know each other and get close.\n\nBose investigate the case of Umapathi, whom no one has been able to touch. He is even involved with a land deal involving crores of money which is completely illegal and others including the DIG is involved. When the chairman of the bank who has lent money for the deal demands the money back as the deal has not worked, Umapathi eliminates him. The people who are customers of the bank take to the streets and try to damage the bank. Bose arrives there, arrests the manager, and takes him away. Somehow, Umapathi comes to know where the manager has been taken. He arrives there with his men and the DIG and nearly kills Bose. Umapathi asks his men to dump the body. On the way, Velu gets involved and ultimately rescues Bose from a burning bus, and Bose dies in Velu's arms. The entire media and the people think Bose has swindled off all the money as they have been made to believe that by the DIG.\n\nVelu decides to take revenge on the people who killed his brother. Firstly he kills Dinesh (Hemanth), his friend and Umapathi's henchman. Then he kills the DIG (he had been taken to jail and he had escaped). Umapathi also kidnaps Velu's entire family. Velu goes to an old temple where he kills Umapathi. He spills the beans that Bose is dead, and he rescues his family under the supervision of the new DIG Gautham Ganesh ([[Prabhu Ganesan|Prabhu]]), who supports him wholeheartedly.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Arun Vijay]] as Velu\n* [[Karthik Muthuraman|Karthik]] as ACP Subash Chandra Bose aka ACP Bose\n* [[Prabhu Ganesan|Prabhu]] as Gautham Ganesh, the new DIG\n* [[Dhansika]] as Anjali\n* [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] as Manickam\n* [[Vagai Chandrasekhar|Chandrashekar]] as Umapathi\n* Hemanth as Dinesh\n* [[Riyaz Khan]] as Easwara Pandian\n* [[Ilavarasu]] as Sivagnanam\n* [[Ganja Karuppu]] as Bhooshan\n* [[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]] as Velu's father\n* [[Meera Krishnan]] as Velu's mother\n* [[Anu Haasan]] as Bose's wife\n* [[Nizhalgal Ravi]] as Anjali's father\n* [[Shakeela]] as Manikkam and Bhooshan's mother\n* [[Lollu Sabha Manohar]] as Manikkam and Bhooshan's father\n* [[R.

He also stated that though the Censor Board had cleared the film, Arun Vijay had \u2018purposely\u2019 delayed the release of the film by not completing his portion of the \u2018dubbing\u2019 work. As he had spent Rs.2 crores till date, the producer told Vijay that he couldn't continue to shoot the film. Meanwhile, he was asked by the actor to release Thunichal after his \u2018Malai Malai\u2019 released. Due to his non-cooperation, instead of releasing \u2018Thunichal\u2019 in 160 theatres, I could release the film only in 16 theatres on 1 January this year, said Kalidoss. Due to this, I incurred a loss of Rs.1.5 crores, he added. \"Due to the mental harassment I had to endure because of Arun Vijay, I couldn\u2019t continue my profession as a doctor for the past 4 years. Vijay has to pay me Rs.1.5 crores and till he does so, the release of his \u2018Maanja Velu\u2019 should be stayed till the 19th of this month,\" he had stated in the petition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.sulekha.com/tamil/maanja-velu/news/arun-vijay-s-maanja-velu-is-stayed-by-hc.htm |title=Arun Vijay's 'Maanja Velu' is stayed by HC&#124;Maanja Velu Film&#124;Movies |publisher=Movies.sulekha.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}</ref> \nDr. Mohan, producer of \u2018Maanja Velu\u2019 and father-in-law of Arun Vijay, had filed a counter petition with the Court praying for vacation of the stay on the grounds that he, as a producer, had nothing to do with Dr. Kalidoss\u2019 case and requested that as such, his film should be allowed to release on the stipulated date. Advocate G. Murugesh Kumar, who appeared on behalf of Dr. Mohan in the court of Mr. Justice T.S. Sivagnanam, managed to putforth his point of view strongly before the Judge and said that Dr. Kalidoss had \u2018wrongly informed\u2019 the Court in the matter. As soon as the Judge announced that he'd be giving the verdict based on the \u2018actual nature\u2019 of the case, Dr. Kalidoss is said to have \u2018withdrawn\u2019 his petition from the Court. Following this, the Judge dismissed the petition and said that the film could release on 21 May as per its original schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.sulekha.com/tamil/maanja-velu/news/high-court-clears-hurdles-in-release-of-maanja-velu.htm |title=High Court clears hurdles in release of 'Maanja Velu'&#124;Maanja Velu Film&#124;Movies |publisher=Movies.sulekha.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Maanja Velu\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Mani Sharma]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| caption    = Front Cover\n| released   =\n| recorded   = Gemini Music\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film soundtrack]]\n| length     =\n| label      = Junglee Music\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe soundtrack is composed by [[Mani Sharma]] and he reused the tunes from the original film ''[[Lakshyam (2007 film)|Lakshyam]]''.

It is a remake of the 2007 [[Cinema of Andhra Pradesh|Telugu film]] ''[[Lakshyam (2007 film)|Lakshyam]]''.<ref name=\"Indiaglitz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/52337.html |title=Tollywood's Lakshyam is Maanja Velu|publisher=Indiaglitz |date=2009-12-04 |accessdate=2011-10-04}}</ref> It has also been dubbed in Hindi as ''Zakhmi Cheetah''. The film became a hit at the box office similar to the previous outing ''[[Malai Malai]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts with a flashback. ACP Bose ([[Karthik Muthuraman|Karthik]]) is a sincere police officer happily married. He lives with his parents and younger brother Velu ([[Arun Vijay]]). Velu is a college student, and he falls in love with his classmate Anjali ([[Dhansika]]). Enters Umapathi ([[Chandrasekar]]), the villain who is notorious for settlements and land deals. Anjali comes across Bose when she is on a field trip from her college with her friends. She gets friendly with his daughter Pinky, who tells her that she would get her introduced to her uncle Velu, and they would make a good pair. It turns out that Velu studies in Anjali\u2019s college and soon after, they come to know each other and get close.\n\nBose investigate the case of Umapathi, whom no one has been able to touch. He is even involved with a land deal involving crores of money which is completely illegal and others including the DIG is involved. When the chairman of the bank who has lent money for the deal demands the money back as the deal has not worked, Umapathi eliminates him. The people who are customers of the bank take to the streets and try to damage the bank. Bose arrives there, arrests the manager, and takes him away. Somehow, Umapathi comes to know where the manager has been taken. He arrives there with his men and the DIG and nearly kills Bose. Umapathi asks his men to dump the body. On the way, Velu gets involved and ultimately rescues Bose from a burning bus, and Bose dies in Velu\u2019s arms. The entire media and the people think Bose has swindled off all the money as they have been made to believe that by the DIG.\n\nVelu decides to take revenge on the people who killed his brother. Firstly he kills Dinesh (Hemanth), his friend and Umapathi\u2019s henchman. Then he kills the DIG (he had been taken to jail and he had escaped). Umapathi also kidnaps Velu's entire family. Velu goes to an old temple where he kills Umapathi. He spills the beans that Bose is dead, and he rescues his family under the supervision of the new DIG Gautham Ganesh ([[Prabhu Ganesan|Prabhu]]), who supports him wholeheartedly.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Arun Vijay]] as Velu\n* [[Karthik Muthuraman|Karthik]] as ACP Subash Chandra Bose aka ACP Bose\n* [[Prabhu Ganesan|Prabhu]] as Gautham Ganesh, the new DIG\n* [[Dhansika]] as Anjali\n* [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] as Manickam\n* [[Vagai Chandrasekhar|Chandrashekar]] as Umapathi\n* Hemanth as Dinesh\n* [[Riyaz Khan]] as Easwara Pandian\n* [[Ilavarasu]] as Sivagnanam\n* [[Ganja Karuppu]] as Bhooshan\n* [[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]] as Velu's father\n* [[Meera Krishnan]] as Velu's mother\n* [[Anu Haasan]] as Bose's wife\n* [[Nizhalgal Ravi]] as Anjali's father\n* [[Shakeela]] as Manikkam and Bhooshan's mother\n* [[Lollu Sabha Manohar]] as Manikkam and Bhooshan's father\n* [[R.

He also stated that though the Censor Board had cleared the film, Arun Vijay had \u2018purposely\u2019 delayed the release of the film by not completing his portion of the \u2018dubbing\u2019 work. As he had spent Rs.2 crores till date, the producer told Vijay that he couldn\u2019t continue to shoot the film. Meanwhile, he was asked by the actor to release Thunichal after his \u2018Malai Malai\u2019 released. Due to his non-cooperation, instead of releasing \u2018Thunichal\u2019 in 160 theatres, I could release the film only in 16 theatres on 1 January this year, said Kalidoss. Due to this, I incurred a loss of Rs.1.5 crores, he added. \"Due to the mental harassment I had to endure because of Arun Vijay, I couldn\u2019t continue my profession as a doctor for the past 4 years. Vijay has to pay me Rs.1.5 crores and till he does so, the release of his \u2018Maanja Velu\u2019 should be stayed till the 19th of this month,\" he had stated in the petition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.sulekha.com/tamil/maanja-velu/news/arun-vijay-s-maanja-velu-is-stayed-by-hc.htm |title=Arun Vijay's 'Maanja Velu' is stayed by HC&#124;Maanja Velu Film&#124;Movies |publisher=Movies.sulekha.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}</ref> \nDr. Mohan, producer of \u2018Maanja Velu\u2019 and father-in-law of Arun Vijay, had filed a counter petition with the Court praying for vacation of the stay on the grounds that he, as a producer, had nothing to do with Dr. Kalidoss\u2019 case and requested that as such, his film should be allowed to release on the stipulated date. Advocate G. Murugesh Kumar, who appeared on behalf of Dr. Mohan in the court of Mr. Justice T.S. Sivagnanam, managed to putforth his point of view strongly before the Judge and said that Dr. Kalidoss had \u2018wrongly informed\u2019 the Court in the matter. As soon as the Judge announced that he\u2019d be giving the verdict based on the \u2018actual nature\u2019 of the case, Dr. Kalidoss is said to have \u2018withdrawn\u2019 his petition from the Court.

In ancient times, there were more open spaces and less population pressure on land.

With development and urbanization, open defecating started becoming a challenge and thereby an important [[public health]] issue, and an issue of human [[dignity]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=O'Reilly |first=Kathleen | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-01-01|title=From toilet insecurity to toilet security: creating safe sanitation for women and girls|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Water|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=19\u201324|doi=10.1002/wat2.1122|issn=2049-1948}}</ref> With the increase in population in smaller areas, such as cities and towns, more attention was given to hygiene and health.

This was due to the publications by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) and the UN [[International Year of Sanitation]]. The JMP is a joint program by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]].\n\nFor monitoring purposes, two categories were created: 1) [[improved sanitation]] and (2) [[unimproved sanitation]]. Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\n\nIn 2013 [[World Toilet Day]] was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/DSG%20sanitation%20two-pager%20FINAL.pdf|title=United Nations Deputy Secretary-General's Call to Action on Sanitation|date=2013|website=United Nations|access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Open defecation free ===\n\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in [[community-led total sanitation]] (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation.<ref name=\"Cavill\">{{cite book |url= http://www.communityledtotalsanitation.org/resource/frontiers-clts-issue-4-sustainability-and-clts-taking-stock |title=Sustainability and CLTS: Taking Stock Frontiers of CLTS: Innovations and Insights Issue 4 |last1=Cavill |last2=Chambers |last3=Vernon | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015 |publisher=IDS |isbn=978-1-78118-222-2 |page=18 }}</ref>\n\nThe Indian [[Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation]] has in mid-2015 defined ODF as \"the termination of [[fecal-oral transmission]], defined by:\n\n# No visible feces found in the environment or village and\n# Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdws.gov.in/sites/default/files/R_274_1441280478318.pdf|title=Guidelines for ODF Verification|date=2015|publisher=Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation}}</ref>\n\nHere, 'safe technology option' means toilets that contain feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://forum.susana.org/71-behaviour-change-and-user-psychology-issues/13746-definition-of-odf-open-defecation-free-indian-government-publication|title=Definition of ODF \u2013 Open Defecation Free (Indian government publication)|date=2015-06-18|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-gb}}</ref> This definition is part of the [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Campaign).\n\n== Reasons ==\n\nThe reasons for open defecation are varied.

This was due to the publications by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) and the UN [[International Year of Sanitation]]. The JMP is a joint program by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]].\n\nFor monitoring purposes, two categories were created: 1) [[improved sanitation]] and (2) [[unimproved sanitation]]. Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\n\nIn 2013 [[World Toilet Day]] was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/DSG%20sanitation%20two-pager%20FINAL.pdf|title=United Nations Deputy Secretary-General's Call to Action on Sanitation|date=2013|website=United Nations|access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Open defecation free ===\n\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in [[community-led total sanitation]] (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation.<ref name=\"Cavill\">{{cite book |url= http://www.communityledtotalsanitation.org/resource/frontiers-clts-issue-4-sustainability-and-clts-taking-stock |title=Sustainability and CLTS: Taking Stock Frontiers of CLTS: Innovations and Insights Issue 4 |last1=Cavill |last2=Chambers |last3=Vernon | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015 |publisher=IDS |isbn=978-1-78118-222-2 |page=18 }}</ref>\n\nThe Indian [[Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation]] has in mid-2015 defined ODF as \"the termination of [[fecal-oral transmission]], defined by:\n\n# No visible feces found in the environment or village and\n# Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdws.gov.in/sites/default/files/R_274_1441280478318.pdf|title=Guidelines for ODF Verification|date=2015|publisher=Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation}}</ref>\n\nHere, 'safe technology option' means toilets that contain feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://forum.susana.org/71-behaviour-change-and-user-psychology-issues/13746-definition-of-odf-open-defecation-free-indian-government-publication|title=Definition of ODF \u2013 Open Defecation Free (Indian government publication)|date=2015-06-18|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-gb}}</ref> This definition is part of the [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Campaign).\n\n== Reasons ==\n\nThe reasons for open defecation are varied. It can be a voluntary, semi-voluntary or involuntary choice. Most of the time, a lack of access to a toilet is the reason. However, in some places even people with toilets in their houses prefer to defecate in the open.<ref name=\"Cavill\" />\n\nA few broad factors that result in the practice of open defecation are listed below.\n\n=== No toilet ===\n\n* Lack of infrastructure: People often lack toilets in their houses, or in the areas where they live.<ref name=\"JMP2019\" /><ref name=\"Routray 880\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Routray P, Schmidt WP, Boisson S, Clasen T, Jenkins MW | title = Socio-cultural and behavioural factors constraining latrine adoption in rural coastal Odisha: an exploratory qualitative study | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 15 | pages = 880 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26357958 | pmc = 4566293 | doi = 10.1186/s12889-015-2206-3 }}</ref>\n* Lack of toilets in other places: Lack of toilets in places away from people's houses, such as in schools or in the farms lead the people to defecate in the open.<ref name=\"Routray 880\" />\n* Use of toilets for other purposes: In some rural communities, toilets are used for other purposes, such as storing household items, animals, farm products or used as kitchens.

If too many people want to use a toilet at the same time, then some people may go outside to defecate instead of waiting.

A key aspect is awareness raising (for example via the UN [[World Toilet Day]] at a global level), behaviour change campaigns, increasing political will as well as demand for sanitation.

The [[Iowa's 1st congressional district|First]] and [[Iowa's 2nd congressional district|Second]] congressional districts received 8 district delegates, the [[Iowa's 3rd congressional district|Third]] received 7 and the [[Iowa's 4th congressional district|Fourth]] received 6.

Redfield notified HHS Secretary [[Alex Azar]] shortly thereafter, who shared his report with the [[National Security Council]] (NSC).

Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation (significantly increasing time to confirm diagnosis), then later to use a workaround, using just two of the three probes and evaluate them locally. By mid-February, the U.S. is still only testing about 100 samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow. This contributed to the inability to establish effective surveillance and contact tracing programs essential to containing the spread of the virus.

Caneva, continued hosting a series of coronavirus e-mail chains begun in January among a group of infectious disease experts from academia and government. The group referred to these chains as the \"Red Dawn\" e-mails, (a [[Red Dawn|movie reference]]). On February 17, an e-mail from one participant indicated that the type of social gathering on the ''Diamond Princess'' cruise ship wasn't that different from a mall, school, or work environment. Another February 17 e-mail indicated that non-pharmaceutical interventions (\"NPI\") such as school and business closures would be difficult for local officials to direct without federal action to provide political cover. By the third week of February, the group had \"effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation\" such as NPI's. This was based on the \"realization that many people in the country were likely infected and capable of spreading the disease, but not showing any symptoms.\"  For instance, by the time of the European travel ban on March 11 (a containment strategy), the group considered such containment steps ineffective. Trump still had not directed NPI's as of March 11. As late as March 13, the CDC was still questioning the benefit of closing schools. Governors began to implement NPI's thereafter, \"largely without federal leadership.\"<ref name=\"NYT_Red_Dawn1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-red-dawn-emails-trump.html?|title=The \u2018Red Dawn\u2019 Emails: 8 Key Exchanges on the Faltering Response to the Coronavirus|date=April 11, 2020|work=nytimes.com|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn February 20 and 21, two more cases of people who had returned from China are confirmed in California.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-21/coronavirus-humboldt-sacramento-county-total-california-cases-to-15 \"California's coronavirus cases now at 15, with new diagnoses in Humboldt, Sacramento areas\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222020122/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-21/coronavirus-humboldt-sacramento-county-total-california-cases-to-15 |date=February 22, 2020 }}, ''Los Angeles Times'', February 21, 2020</ref> The first case of [[community transmission]], because it had no known origin, is confirmed in Solano County, California, on February 26.<ref>[https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-006.aspx \"CDC Confirms Possible First Instance of COVID-19 Community Transmission in California\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228203724/https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-006.aspx |date=February 28, 2020 }}, ''Calif.

Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation (significantly increasing time to confirm diagnosis), then later to use a workaround, using just two of the three probes and evaluate them locally. By mid-February, the U.S. is still only testing about 100 samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow. This contributed to the inability to establish effective surveillance and contact tracing programs essential to containing the spread of the virus. Researchers concluded in late February that \"the virus had probably been [[Transmission (medicine)|spreading]] for weeks\" person-to-person.<ref name=\"NYT_Test1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html|title=The Lost Month:How a Failure to Test Blinded the U.S. to Covid-19|date=March 28, 2020|via=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\n====January 21-31====\n[[File:Donald Trump Coronavirus briefing.jpg|thumb|President [[Donald Trump]] received a briefing on the coronavirus on January 29, 2020.|alt=]]\n\nThe first reported case in the U.S. was in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] on January 21, 2020, which affected a man who had returned from [[Wuhan]], China.

The group referred to these chains as the \"Red Dawn\" e-mails, (a [[Red Dawn|movie reference]]). On February 17, an e-mail from one participant indicated that the type of social gathering on the ''Diamond Princess'' cruise ship wasn't that different from a mall, school, or work environment. Another February 17 e-mail indicated that non-pharmaceutical interventions (\"NPI\") such as school and business closures would be difficult for local officials to direct without federal action to provide political cover. By the third week of February, the group had \"effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation\" such as NPI's. This was based on the \"realization that many people in the country were likely infected and capable of spreading the disease, but not showing any symptoms.\"  For instance, by the time of the European travel ban on March 11 (a containment strategy), the group considered such containment steps ineffective. Trump still had not directed NPI's as of March 11. As late as March 13, the CDC was still questioning the benefit of closing schools. Governors began to implement NPI's thereafter, \"largely without federal leadership.\"<ref name=\"NYT_Red_Dawn1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-red-dawn-emails-trump.html?|title=The \u2018Red Dawn\u2019 Emails: 8 Key Exchanges on the Faltering Response to the Coronavirus|date=April 11, 2020|work=nytimes.com|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn February 20 and 21, two more cases of people who had returned from China are confirmed in California.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-21/coronavirus-humboldt-sacramento-county-total-california-cases-to-15 \"California's coronavirus cases now at 15, with new diagnoses in Humboldt, Sacramento areas\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222020122/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-21/coronavirus-humboldt-sacramento-county-total-california-cases-to-15 |date=February 22, 2020 }}, ''Los Angeles Times'', February 21, 2020</ref> The first case of [[community transmission]], because it had no known origin, is confirmed in Solano County, California, on February 26.<ref>[https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-006.aspx \"CDC Confirms Possible First Instance of COVID-19 Community Transmission in California\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228203724/https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-006.aspx |date=February 28, 2020 }}, ''Calif.
