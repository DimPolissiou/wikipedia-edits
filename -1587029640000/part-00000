Two individuals, [[Truganini]] (1812\u20131876) and [[Fanny Cochrane Smith]] (1834\u20131905), are separately considered to have been the last people solely of Tasmanian descent.{{efn|For discussion of the Truganini claim, and the other candidates, Suke and Fanny Cochrane Smith, see {{harvnb|Taylor|2008a|pp=140ff.}}}}{{efn|Lyndall Ryan denies Truganini was the last \"full-blood\" and makes a case for ''Suke'' (d. circa 1888) {{harv|Ryan|1996|p=220}}}}\n\nThe complete [[Tasmanian languages|Aboriginal Tasmanian languages]] have been lost; some original Tasmanian language words remained in use with Palawa people in the [[Furneaux Group|Furneaux Islands]], and there are some efforts to [[Palawa kani|reconstruct a language]] from the available wordlists. Today, some thousands of people living in Tasmania describe themselves as Aboriginal Tasmanians, since a number of Palawa women bore children to European men in the Furneaux Islands and mainland Tasmania.\n\n==History==\n===Before European settlement===\n[[File:Bassian plain 14000 BP.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Shoreline of Tasmania and Victoria about 14,000 years ago as sea levels were rising showing some of the human archaeological sites \u2013 see [[Prehistory of Australia]]]]\n\nPeople crossed into Tasmania approximately 40,000 years, ago via a [[land bridge]] between the island and the rest of mainland Australia, during the [[Last Glacial Period]]. According to genetic studies, once the sea level rose, flooding the [[Bass Strait|Bassian Plain]], the people were left isolated for approximately 8,000 years, until the time of European exploration, during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.{{sfn|Pardoe|1991|pp=1\u201327}}\n\nUntil the 1980s, it was thought that Tasmania was only occupied relatively recently, but the discovery of 19,000-year-old deposits at [[Kutikina Cave|Kutikina (or Fraser) Cave]] demonstrated the Ice Age occupation of the highlands.{{sfn|Reynolds|2006|pp=58\u201363}}{{sfn|Johnson|McFarlane|2015|p=31}} In 1990, archaeologists excavated material in the Warreen Cave in the Maxwell River valley of the south-west, proving Aboriginal occupation from as early as 34,000 [[Before Present|BP]], making Aboriginal Tasmanians the southern-most population in the world during the [[Pleistocene]] era. Modern digs in southwest and central Tasmania turned up very abundant finds, affording \"the richest archaeological evidence from Pleistocene Greater Australia\" covering the period from 35,000 to 11,000 BP.{{sfn|Lourandos|1993|pp=72\u201373}}\n\n==== Migration chronology ====\nTasmania was colonised by successive waves of Aboriginal people from southern Australia during [[glacial maximum|glacial maxima]], when the sea was at its lowest. The archeological and geographic record suggests a period of drying, with the colder glacial period, with a desert extending from southern Australia into the midlands of Tasmania - with intermittent periods of wetter, warmer weather. People migrating from southern Australia into peninsular Tasmania would have crossed stretches of seawater and desert, and finally found oases in the King highlands (now King Island).\n\nThe archeological, geographic and linguistic record suggests a pattern of successive occupation of Tasmania, and coalescence of three ethnic or language groups into one broad group. Evidence for contest over territory is reflected by the presence of ''Nara'' (the broad western Tasmania language group) toponymy in ''Mara'' (the broad eastern language group) territory; for example - suggesting a pattern of occupation and hostile takeover that mirrors traditional hostilities during colonial times.\nColonial settlers found two main language groups in Tasmania upon their arrival, which correlates with the broader nation or clan divisions.\n* ''Pleistocene Palawa'' language group - first ethnic and language group in Tasmania - absorbed or displaced by successive invasions except for remnant group on Tasman peninsula. Absorbed population in Eastern Tasmania combined with \"victorian speakers\" to form '''\"Mara\"''' language group across broader eastern Tasmania\n* ''Furneaux speakers'' displace Palawa in N/E Tasmania as far south as Orford - themselves disappear or are absorbed into Mara language group -the ''Mara'' language group a composite of ''pleistocene palawa, Furneaux and Victorian''\n* '''''Nara''''' speakers invade, but are pushed back to western Tasmania - correlates with Western nation of Tasmanian Aboriginal people.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nAfter the sea rose to create Bass Strait, the Australian mainland and Tasmania became separate land masses, and the Aboriginal people who had migrated from mainland Australia became cut off from their cousins on the mainland. Archeological evidence suggests remnant populations on the King and Furneaux highlands being stranded by rising waters - later to die out.\n\n===Early European contact===\nAbel Jansen Tasman, credited as the first European to discover Tasmania (in 1642) and who named it Van Diemen's Land, did not encounter any of the Aboriginal Tasmanians when he landed.\nIn 1772, a French exploratory expedition under [[Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne|Marion Dufresne]] visited Tasmania. At first, contact with the Aboriginal people was friendly; however the Aboriginal Tasmanians became alarmed when another boat was dispatched towards the shore. It was reported that spears and stones were thrown and the French responded with musket fire, killing at least one Aboriginal person and wounding several others. Two later French expeditions led by [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] in 1792\u201393 and [[Nicolas Baudin]] in 1802 made friendly contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians; the d'Entrecasteaux expedition doing so over an extended period of time.{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=58\u201360}}\n\nThe ''Resolution'' under [[Tobias Furneaux|Captain Tobias Furneaux]] (part of an expedition led by [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]]) had visited in 1773 but made no contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians although gifts were left for them in unoccupied shelters found on Bruny Island. The first known British contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians was on Bruny Island by Captain Cook in 1777. The contact was peaceful. [[William Bligh|Captain William Bligh]] also visited Bruny Island in 1788 and made peaceful contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|pp=3\u20138}}\n\n===Contact with sealers on the north and east coasts===\nMore extensive contact between Aboriginal Tasmanians and Europeans resulted when British and American seal hunters began visiting the islands in Bass Strait as well as the northern and eastern coasts of Tasmania from the late 1790s. Shortly thereafter (by about 1800), sealers were regularly left on uninhabited islands in Bass Strait during the sealing season (November to May). The sealers established semi-permanent camps or settlements on the islands, which were close enough for the sealers to reach the main island of Tasmania in small boats and so make contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians.{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=58\u201360,76}}\n\nTrading relationships developed between sealers and Tasmanian Aboriginal tribes. Hunting dogs became highly prized by the Aboriginal people, as were other exotic items such as flour, tea and tobacco. The Aboriginal people traded kangaroo skins for such goods. However, a trade in Aboriginal women soon developed. Many Tasmanian Aboriginal women were highly skilled in hunting seals, as well as in obtaining other foods such as seabirds, and some Tasmanian tribes would trade their services and, more rarely, those of Aboriginal men to the sealers for the seal-hunting season. Others were sold on a permanent basis. This trade incorporated not only women of the tribe engaged in the trade but also women abducted from other tribes. Some may have been given to incorporate the new arrivals into Aboriginal society through marriage.\n\nSealers engaged in raids along the coasts to abduct Aboriginal women and were reported to have killed Aboriginal men in the process. By 1810 seal numbers had been greatly reduced by hunting so most seal hunters abandoned the area, however a small number of sealers, approximately fifty mostly \"renegade sailors, escaped convicts or ex-convicts\", remained as permanent residents of the Bass Strait islands and some established families with Tasmanian Aboriginal women.{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=58\u201360}}\n\nSome of the women were taken back to the islands by the sealers involuntarily and some went willingly, as in the case of a woman called Tarerenorerer (Eng:Walyer). Differing opinions have been given on Walyer's involvement with the sealers. McFarlane writes that she voluntarily joined the sealers with members of her family, and was responsible for attacking Aboriginal people and white settlers alike.{{sfn|McFarlane|2008|p=119}} Ryan comes to a different conclusion, that Walyer had been abducted at Port Sorell by Aboriginal people and traded to the sealers for dogs and flour.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=141}} Walyer was later to gain some notoriety for her attempts to kill the sealers to escape their brutality. Walyer, a Punnilerpanner, joined the Plairhekehillerplue band after eventually escaping and went on to lead attacks on employees of the [[Van Diemen's Land Company]]. Walyer's attacks are the first recorded use of [[musket]]s by Aboriginal people. Captured, she refused to work and was banished to [[Penguin Island (Tasmania)|Penguin Island]]. Later imprisoned on [[Swan Island (Tasmania)|Swan Island]] she attempted to organise a rebellion. Although Aboriginal women were by custom forbidden to take part in war, several Aboriginal women who escaped from sealers became leaders or took part in attacks. According to Lyndall Ryan, the women traded to, or kidnapped by sealers became \"a significant dissident group\" against white authority.{{sfn|Merry|2003}}\n\nHistorian James Bonwick reported Aboriginal women who were clearly captives of sealers but he also reported women living with sealers who \"proved faithful and affectionate to their new husbands\", women who appeared \"content\" and others who were allowed to visit their \"native tribe\", taking gifts, with the sealers being confident that they would return.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|pp=295\u2013297}} Bonwick also reports a number of claims of brutality by sealers towards Aboriginal women including some of those made by Robinson.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|pp=295\u2013301}} An Aboriginal woman by the name of Bulrer related her experience to Robinson, that sealers had rushed her camp and stolen six women including herself \"the white men tie them and then they flog them very much, plenty much blood, plenty cry.\" Sealing captain, James Kelly, wrote in 1816 that the custom of the sealers was to each have \"two to five of these native women for their own use and benefit.\" A shortage of women available \"in trade\" resulted in abduction becoming common and in 1830 it was reported that at least fifty Aboriginal women were \"kept in slavery\" on the Bass Strait islands.{{sfn|Merry|2003}}\n<blockquote>\"Harrington, a sealer, procured ten or fifteen native women, and placed them on different islands in Bass's Straits, where he left them to procure skins; if, however, when he returned, they had not obtained enough, he punished them by tying them up to trees for twenty-four to thirty-six hours together, flogging them at intervals, and he killed them not infrequently if they proved stubborn.\" (H.W.Parker ''The Rise, Progress, and Present State of V. D. Land'' 1833){{sfn|Roth|1899}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThe raids for, and trade in, Aboriginal women contributed to the rapid depletion of the numbers of Aboriginal women in the northern areas of Tasmania, \"by 1830 only three women survived in northeast Tasmania among 72 men\",{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=58\u201360}} and thus contributed in a significant manner to the demise of the full-blooded Aboriginal population of Tasmania. However many modern day Aboriginal Tasmanians trace their descent from the 19th century sealer communities of Bass Strait.\n\nThere are numerous stories of the sealers' brutality towards the Aboriginal women; with some of these reports originating from Robinson. In 1830, Robinson seized 14 Aboriginal women from the sealers, planning for them to marry Aboriginal men at the Flinders Island settlement. [[Josephine Flood]], an archaeologist specialising in Australian mainland Aboriginal peoples, notes: \"he encountered strong resistance from the women as well as sealers\". The sealers sent a representative, [[James Munro (sealer)|James Munro]], to appeal to [[Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet|Governor Arthur]] and argue for the women's return on the basis that they wanted to stay with their sealer husbands and children rather than marry Aboriginal men unknown to them. Arthur ordered the return of some of the women. Shortly thereafter, Robinson began to disseminate stories, told to him by James Munro, of atrocities allegedly committed by the sealers against Aboriginal people and against Aboriginal women, in particular. [[Brian Plomley]], who edited Robinson's papers, expressed scepticism about these atrocities and notes that they were not reported to [[William Grant Broughton|Archdeacon Broughton]]'s 1830 committee of inquiry into violence towards Tasmanians. Abduction and ill-treatment of Aboriginal Tasmanians certainly occurred, but the extent is debated.{{sfn|Flood|2006|p=76}}\n\n===After European settlement===\n[[File:Dowling Natives of Tasmania.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Hawker Dowling|Robert Dowling]], ''Group of Natives of Tasmania'', 1859. Critic [[Bernard William Smith]] assessed the work as a \"history painting in the full sense of the word\", with the natives \"seated\u2014emblematic of their situation\u2014around the dying embers of a burnt-out log near a great blackened stump, and in the far left corner there is a leafless tree with shattered branches.\"{{sfn|Smith|1971|p=57}} ]]\nBetween 1803 and 1823, there were two phases of conflict between the Aboriginal people and the British colonists. The first took place between 1803 and 1808 over the need for common food sources such as oysters and kangaroos, and the second between 1808 and 1823, when only a small number of white females lived among the colonists, and farmers, sealers and whalers took part in the trading, and the abduction, of Aboriginal women as sexual partners. These practices also increased conflict over women among Aboriginal tribes. This in turn led to a decline in the Aboriginal population. Historian Lyndall Ryan records 74 Aboriginal people (almost all women) living with sealers on the Bass Strait islands in the period up to 1835.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=313}}\n\nBy 1816, kidnapping of Aboriginal children for labour had become widespread. In 1814, [[Governor]] [[Thomas Davey (governor)|Thomas Davey]] issued a proclamation expressing \"utter indignation and abhorrence\" in regards to the kidnapping of the children and in 1819 Governor [[William Sorell]] not only re-issued the proclamation but ordered that those who had been taken without parental consent were to be sent to Hobart and supported at government expense.{{sfn|Bringing them Home \u2013 The Report}}\nA number of young Aboriginal children were known to be living with settlers. An Irish sealer named Brien spared the life of the baby son of a native woman he had abducted, explaining, \"as (he) had stolen the dam he would keep the cub.\" When the child grew up he became an invaluable assistant to Brien but was considered \"no good\" by his own people as he was brought up to dislike Aboriginal people, whom he considered \"dirty lazy brutes.\"{{sfn|Merry|2003}} Twenty-six were definitely known (through baptismal records) to have been taken into settlers' homes as infants or very small children, too young to be of service as labourers. Some Aboriginal children were sent to the Orphan School in Hobart.{{sfn|Flood|2006|p=77}} Lyndall Ryan reports fifty-eight Aboriginal people, of various ages, living with settlers in Tasmania in the period up to 1835.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=176}}\n\nSome historians argue that European disease did not appear to be a serious factor until after 1829.{{sfn|Boyce|2009|p=65}} Other historians including [[Geoffrey Blainey]] and [[Keith Windschuttle]], point to introduced disease as the main cause of the destruction of the full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal population. Keith Windschuttle argues that while smallpox never reached Tasmania, respiratory diseases such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis and the effects of venereal diseases devastated the Tasmanian Aboriginal population whose long isolation from contact with the mainland compromised their resistance to introduced disease. The work of historian [[James Bonwick]] and anthropologist H. Ling Roth, both writing in the 19th century, also point to the significant role of epidemics and infertility without clear attribution of the sources of the diseases as having been introduced through contact with Europeans. Bonwick, however, did note that Tasmanian Aboriginal women were infected with venereal diseases by Europeans. Introduced venereal disease not only directly caused deaths but, more insidiously, left a significant percentage of the population unable to reproduce. Josephine Flood, archaeologist, wrote: \"Venereal disease sterilised and chest complaints \u2013 influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis \u2013 killed.\"{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=77,90,128}}{{sfn|Windschuttle|2002|pp=372\u2013376}}\n\nBonwick, who lived in Tasmania, recorded a number of reports of the devastating effect of introduced disease including one report by a Doctor Story, a [[Quaker]], who wrote: \"After 1823 the women along with the tribe seemed to have had no children; but why I do not know.\".{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|p=388}} Later historians have reported that introduced venereal disease caused infertility amongst the Aboriginal Tasmanians.{{sfn|Flood|2006|p=90}}{{sfn|Windschuttle|2002|pp=375\u2013376}} Bonwick also recorded a strong Aboriginal oral tradition of an epidemic even before formal colonisation in 1803. \"Mr Robert Clark, in a letter to me, said: 'I have gleaned from some of the aborigines, now in their graves, that they were more numerous than the white people were aware of, but their numbers were very much thinned by a sudden attack of disease which was general among the entire population previous to the arrival of the English, entire tribes of natives having been swept off in the course of one or two days' illness.'\"{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|pp=84\u201385}} Such an epidemic may be linked to contact with sailors or sealers.{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nHenry Ling Roth, an anthropologist, wrote: \"Calder, who has gone more fully into the particulars of their illnesses, writes as follows ...: 'Their rapid declension after the colony was founded is traceable, as far as our proofs allow us to judge, to the prevalence of epidemic disorders\u2026.'\"{{sfn|Roth|1899}} Roth was referring to James Erskine Calder who took up a post as a surveyor in Tasmania in 1829 and who wrote a number of scholarly papers about the Aboriginal people. \"According to Calder, a rapid and remarkable declension of the numbers of the aborigines had been going on long before the remnants were gathered together on Flinders Island. Whole tribes (some of which Robinson mentions by name as being in existence fifteen or twenty years before he went amongst them, and which probably never had a shot fired at them) had absolutely and entirely vanished. To the causes to which he attributes this strange wasting away ... I think [[infertility|infecundity]], produced by the infidelity of the women to their husbands in the early times of the colony, may be safely added ... Robinson always enumerates the sexes of the individuals he took; ... and as a general thing, found scarcely any children amongst them; ... adultness was found to outweigh infancy everywhere in a remarkable degree ...\"{{sfn|Roth|1899|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nRobinson recorded in his journals a number of comments regarding the Aboriginal Tasmanians' susceptibility to diseases, particularly respiratory diseases. In 1832 he revisited the west coast of Tasmania, far from the settled regions, and wrote: \"The numbers of aborigines along the western coast have been considerably reduced since the time of my last visit [1830]. A mortality has raged amongst them which together with the severity of the season and other causes had rendered the paucity of their number very considerable.\"{{efn|Robinson writing to Edward Curr, 22 Sept 1832. {{harv|Plomley|2008|p=732}}}}\n\nBetween 1825 and 1831 a pattern of guerilla warfare by the Aboriginal Tasmanians was identified by the colonists. Rapid pastoral expansion, a depletion of native game and an increase in the colony's population triggered Aboriginal resistance from 1824 onwards when it has been estimated by Lyndall Ryan that 1000 Aboriginal people remained in the settled districts. Whereas settlers and stock keepers had previously provided rations to the Aboriginal people during their seasonal movements across the settled districts, and recognised this practice as some form of payment for trespass and loss of traditional hunting grounds, the new settlers and stock keepers were unwilling to maintain these arrangements and the Aboriginal people began to raid settlers' huts for food.\n\nThe official Government position was that Aboriginal people were blameless for any hostilities, but when [[Musquito]] was hanged in 1825, a significant debate was generated which split the colonists along class lines. The \"higher grade\" saw the hanging as a dangerous precedent and argued that Aboriginal people were only defending their land and should not be punished for doing so. The \"lower grade\" of colonists wanted more Aboriginal people hanged to encourage a \"conciliatory line of conduct.\" Governor Arthur sided with the \"lower grade\" and 1825 saw the first official acceptance that Aboriginal people were at least partly to blame for conflict.\n\nIn 1826 the Government gazette, which had formerly reported \"retaliatory actions\" by Aboriginal people, now reported \"acts of atrocity\" and for the first time used the terminology \"Aborigine\" instead of \"native\". A newspaper reported that there were only two solutions to the problem: either they should be \"hunted down like wild beasts and destroyed\" or they should be removed from the settled districts. The colonial Government assigned troops to drive them out. A Royal Proclamation in 1828 established military posts on the boundaries and a further proclamation declared [[martial law]] against the Aboriginal people. As it was recognised that there were fixed routes for seasonal migration, Aboriginal people were required to have passes if they needed to cross the settled districts with bounties offered for the capture of those without passes, \u00a35 (around 2010:$1,000) for an adult and \u00a32 for children, a process that often led to organised hunts resulting in deaths. Every dispatch from Governor Arthur to the Secretary of State during this period stressed that in every case where Aboriginal people had been killed it was colonists that initiated hostilities.{{sfn|Cove|1995|pp=25\u201329}}\n\nThough many Aboriginal deaths went unrecorded, the [[Cape Grim massacre]] in 1828 demonstrates the level of frontier violence towards Aboriginal Tasmanians.\n\nThe [[Black War]] of 1828\u201332 and the [[Black Line]] of 1830 were turning points in the relationship with European settlers. Even though many of the Aboriginal people managed to avoid capture during these events, they were shaken by the size of the campaigns against them, and this brought them to a position whereby they were willing to surrender to Robinson and move to [[Flinders Island]].\n\n====Tasmanian aboriginals and settlers mentioned in literature 1800\u20131835====\nEuropeans killed and Aborigines captured may be considered as reasonably accurate.

It was bounded on one side by the sea, and on the other side by a saltwater lagoon bordered with thick tea-tree which cut off access to the main island. {{citation needed|date=May 2017}}}}\nSupplies to the settlement were inadequate and if sealers had not supplied potatoes, the Aboriginal people would have starved. The Europeans were living on oatmeal and potatoes while the Aboriginal people, who detested oatmeal and refused to eat it, survived on potatoes and rice supplemented by [[short-tailed shearwater|mutton birds]] they caught.{{sfn|Roth|1899|p=3}} Within months 31 Aboriginal people had died. <blockquote>They were lodged at night in shelters or \"breakwinds.\" These \"breakwinds\" were thatched roofs sloping to the ground, with an opening at the top to let out the smoke, and closed at the ends, with the exception of a doorway. They were twenty feet long by ten feet wide. In each of these from twenty to thirty blacks were lodged ... To savages accustomed to sleep naked in the open air beneath the rudest shelter, the change to close and heated dwellings tended to make them susceptible, as they had never been in their wild state, to chills from atmospheric changes, and was only too well calculated to induce those severe pulmonary diseases which were destined to prove so fatal to them. The same may be said of the use of clothes ... At the settlement they were compelled to wear clothes, which they threw off when heated or when they found them troublesome, and when wetted by rain allowed them to dry on their bodies. In the case of Tasmanians, as with other wild tribes accustomed to go naked, the use of clothes had a most mischievous effect on their health.{{sfn|Roth|1899}}</blockquote>\n[[File:Benjamin Duterrau - Mr Robinson's first interview with Timmy - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benjamin Duterrau]], ''Mr Robinson's first interview with Timmy'', 1840]]\n\nBy January 1832 a further 44 captured Aboriginals had arrived and conflicts arose between the tribal groups. To defuse the situation, Sergeant Wight took the Big River group to [[Green Island (Tasmania)|Green island]], where they were abandoned and he later decided to move the rest to Green Island as well. Two weeks later Robinson arrived with Lieutenant Darling, the new commander for the station, and moved the Aboriginal people back to The Lagoons. Darling ensured a supply of plentiful food and permitted \"hunting excursions.\" In October 1832, it was decided to build a new camp with better buildings ([[wattle and daub]]) at a more suitable location, Pea Jacket Point. Pea Jacket Point was renamed Civilisation Point but became more commonly known as Wybalenna, which in the Ben Lomond language meant \"Blackman's Houses\".{{sfn|Roth|1899}}\n\nRobinson befriended Truganini, learned some of the local language and in 1833 managed to persuade the remaining 154 \"full-blooded\" people to move to the new settlement on Flinders Island, where he promised a modern and comfortable environment, and that they would be returned to their former homes on the Tasmanian mainland as soon as possible. At the Wybalenna Aboriginal establishment on Flinders Island, described by historian [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] as the \"best equipped and most lavishly staffed Aboriginal institution in the Australian colonies in the nineteenth century\", they were provided with housing, clothing, rations of food, the services of a doctor and educational facilities. Convicts were assigned to build housing and do most of the work at the settlement including the growing of food in the vegetable gardens.{{efn|Flood cites Henry Reynolds. {{harv|Flood|2006|p=88}}}} After arrival, all Aboriginal children aged between six and 15 years were removed from their families to be brought up by the storekeeper and a lay preacher.{{sfn|Bringing them Home \u2013 The Report}} The Aboriginal people were free to roam the island and were often absent from the settlement for extended periods on hunting trips as the rations supplied turned out to be inadequate. By 1835 the living conditions had deteriorated to the extent that in October Robinson personally took charge of Wybalenna, organising better food and improving the housing. However, of the 220 who arrived with Robinson, most died in the following 14 years from introduced disease and inadequate shelter. As a result of their loss of freedom, the birth rate was extremely low and few children survived infancy.\n[[File:oyster cove mob.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Oyster Cove Mob]]\nIn 1839, Governor Franklin appointed a board to inquire into the conditions at Wybalenna that rejected Robinson's claims regarding improved living conditions and found the settlement to be a failure. The report was never released and the government continued to promote Wybalenna as a success in the treatment of Aboriginal people.{{sfn|Howson|2004}}\nIn March 1847 six Aboriginals at Wybalenna presented a petition to [[Queen Victoria]], the first petition to a reigning monarch from any Aboriginal group in Australia, requesting that the promises made to them be honoured.{{efn|Since the 1980s this petition has been the focus of a major argument in the legal battle regarding the promises that Robinson and Governor Arthur made to the Tasmanian Aborigines. {{citation needed|date=May 2017}}}}\nIn October 1847, the 47 survivors were transferred to their final settlement at Oyster Cove station.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|pp=270\u2013295}} Only 44 survived the trip (11 couples, 12 single men and 10 children) and the children were immediately sent to the orphan school in Hobart.{{sfn|Bringing them Home \u2013 The Report}} Although the housing and food was better than Wybalenna, the station was a former convict station that had been abandoned earlier that year due to health issues as it was located on inadequately drained [[mudflat]]s. According to the guards, the Aboriginal people developed \"too much independence\" by trying to continue their culture which they considered \"recklessness\" and \"rank ingratitude.\" Their numbers continued to diminish, being estimated in 1859 at around a dozen and, by 1869, there was only one, who died in 1876.\n\nCommenting in 1899 on Robinson's claims of success, anthropologist [[Henry Ling Roth]] wrote:<blockquote>While Robinson and others were doing their best to make them into a civilised people, the poor blacks had given up the struggle, and were solving the difficult problem by dying. The very efforts made for their welfare only served to hasten on their inevitable doom. The white man's civilisation proved scarcely less fatal than the white man's musket.{{sfn|Roth|1899}}</blockquote>\n\n==== Anthropological interest ====\n[[File:Fanny Cochrane Smith.oga|thumb|1903 recording of a Tasmanian language]]\nThe Oyster Cove people attracted contemporaneous international scientific interest from the 1860s onwards, with many museums claiming body parts for their collections. Scientists were interested in studying Aboriginal Tasmanians from a [[physical anthropology]] perspective, hoping to gain insights into the field of [[paleoanthropology]]. For these reasons, they were interested in individual Aboriginal body parts and whole [[skeletons]].\n\nTasmanian Aboriginal [[Human skull|skulls]] were particularly sought internationally for studies into [[craniofacial anthropometry]]. Truganini herself entertained fears that her body might be exploited after her death and two years after her death her body was exhumed and sent to Melbourne for scientific study. Her skeleton was then put up for public display in the Tasmanian Museum until 1947, and was only lay to rest, by cremation, in 1976.{{sfn|Fforde|Hubert|2006|pp=79\u201380}} Another case was the removal of the skull and scrotum \u2013 for a tobacco pouch \u2013 of William Lanne, known as King Billy, on his death in 1869.\n\nHowever, many of these skeletons were obtained from \"aboriginal mummies\" from graves or bodies of the murdered. [[Amalie Dietrich]] for example became famous for delivering such specimens.{{sfn|Turnbull|1991}}\n\nAboriginal people have considered the dispersal of body parts as being disrespectful, as a common aspect within Aboriginal [[belief systems]] is that a soul can only be at rest when laid in its homeland.\n\n=== 20th century to present ===\n[[File:Fanny Cochrane Smith recording.jpg|thumb|Horace Watson recording the songs of [[Fanny Cochrane Smith]], considered to be the last fluent speaker of a Tasmanian language, 1903. Singer [[Bruce Watson (songwriter)|Bruce Watson]], descendant of Watson, composed a song about this picture and later performed it with singer Ronnie Summers, a descendant of Smith.]]\nBody parts and ornaments are still being returned from collections today, with the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] returning samples of Truganini's skin and hair (in 2002), and the [[British Museum]] returning ashes to two descendants in 2007.{{sfn|Bodies of Knowledge}}\n\nDuring the 20th century, the absence of Aboriginal people of solely Aboriginal ancestry, and a general unawareness of the surviving populations, meant many non-Aboriginal people assumed they were [[extinct]], after the death of [[Truganini]] in 1876. Since the mid-1970s Tasmanian Aboriginal activists such as [[Michael Mansell]] have sought to broaden awareness and identification of Aboriginal descent.\n\nA dispute exists within the Tasmanian Aboriginal community, however, over what constitutes [[Aboriginality]]. Since splitting from the [[Lia Pootah]] in 1996, the Palawa minority were given the power to decide who is of Tasmanian Aboriginal descent at the state level (entitlement to government Aboriginal services). Palawa recognise only descendants of the Bass Strait Island community as Aboriginal and do not consider as Aboriginal the Lia Pootah, who claim descent, based on oral traditions, from Tasmanian mainland Aboriginal communities. The Lia Pootah feel that the Palawa controlled [[Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre]] does not represent them politically.{{sfn|Lia Pootah Community|2008}}{{sfn|Australian Broadcasting Corporation|2002}}\nSince 2007 there have been initiatives to introduce [[DNA profiling|DNA testing]] to establish family history in descendant subgroups. This is strongly opposed by the Palawa and has drawn an angry reaction from some quarters, as some have claimed \"[[spirituality|spiritual]] connection\" with Aboriginality distinct from, but not as important as the existence of a genetic link. The Lia Pootah object to the current test used to prove Aboriginality as they believe it favours the Palawa, a [[DNA test]] would circumvent barriers to Lia Pootah recognition, or disprove their claims to Aboriginality.{{sfn|Denholm|2007}}\n\nIn April 2000, the Tasmanian Government ''Legislative Council Select Committee on Aboriginal Lands'' discussed the difficulty of determining Aboriginality based on oral traditions. An example given by Prof. [[Cassandra Pybus]] was the claim by the Huon and Channel Aboriginal people who had an oral history of descent from two Aboriginal women. Research found that both were non-Aboriginal convict women.{{sfn|Legislative Council Select Committee|2002}}\n\nThe Tasmanian Palawa Aboriginal community is making an effort to reconstruct and reintroduce a Tasmanian language, called [[palawa kani]] out of the various records on Tasmanian languages. Other Tasmanian Aboriginal communities use words from traditional Tasmanian languages, according to the language area they were born or live in.\n\n==Tasmanian Aboriginal nations==\n[[File:Tasmanian tribes.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Map of Tasmanian nations]]\nThe social organisation of Aboriginal Tasmanians had at least two hierarchies: the domestic unit or family group and the social unit or clan - which had a self-defining name with 40 to 50 people. It is contentious whether there was a larger political organisation, hitherto described as a \"tribe\" in the literature (and by colonial observers), as there is no evidence in the historical literature of larger political entities above that of the clan. Robinson, who gathered ethnographic data in the early 1800s, described aboriginal political groups at the clan level only. Nevertheless, clans that shared a geographic region and language group are now usually classified by modern ethnographers, and the Palawa, as a nation.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|pp=10\u201311}}{{sfn|Taylor|2006}}\n\nEstimates made of the combined population of the Aboriginal people of Tasmania, before European arrival in Tasmania, are in the range of 3,000 to 15,000 people.{{sfn|Madley|2008|pp=77\u2013106}} Genetic studies have suggested much higher figures which is supported by oral traditions that Aboriginal people were \"more numerous than the white people were aware of\" but that their population had been greatly reduced by a sudden outbreak of disease before 1803. It is speculated that early contacts with sealers before colonisation had resulted in an epidemic.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|pp=84\u201385}} Using archaeological evidence, Stockton (I983:68) estimated 3,000 to 6,000 for the northern half of the west coast alone, or up to six times the commonly accepted estimate, however he later revised this to 3,000 to 5,000 for the entire island, based on historical sources. The low rate of [[genetic drift]] indicates that Stockton's original maximum estimate is likely the lower boundary and, while not indicated by the archaeological record, a population as high as 100,000 can \"not be rejected out of hand\". This is supported by [[carrying capacity]] data indicating greater resource productivity in Tasmania than the mainland.{{sfn|Pardoe|1991|pp=1\u201327}}\n\nThe Aboriginal Tasmanians were primarily nomadic people who lived in adjoining territories, moving based on seasonal changes in food supplies such as seafood, land mammals and native vegetables and berries. They socialised, intermarried and fought \"wars\" against other clans.{{sfn|ABS|2008}}\n\nAccording to Ryan,{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=14}} the population of Tasmania was aligned into nine nations composed of six to fifteen clans each, with each clan comprising two to six extended family units who were relations. Individual clans ranged over a defined nation boundary with elaborate rites of entry required of visitors.{{sfn|Huys|2009|p=17}}\n\nThere were more than 60 clans before European colonisation, although only 48 have been located and associated with particular territories.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|pp=10\u201311}}\nThe location and migratory patterns discussed below come from the work of Jones (cited in Tindale). Ryan used Jones' work in her seminal history of Tasmanian Aboriginals{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}} but Taylor discusses in his thesis how Jones' original work is uncited and possibly conjectural.{{sfn|Taylor|2006}} Moreover, Jones published his work without recourse to Plomley's later extensive descriptions of Tasmanian Aboriginal clan groups. Given this, the clan boundaries and nomadic patterns discussed below should be taken with caution unless referenced from primary documents.\n\n===Oyster Bay (Paredarerme)===\nThe Paredarerme was estimated to be the largest Tasmanian nation with ten clans totalling 700 to 800 people.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=17}} The members of the Paredarerme nation had good relations with the Big River nation, with large congregations at favoured hunting sites inland and at the coast. Relations with the North Midlands nation were mostly hostile, and evidence suggests that the [[Douglas-Apsley National Park|Douglas-Apsley]] region may have been a dangerous borderland rarely visited (Ferguson 1986 pg22). Generally, the clans of the Paredarerme ranged inland to the High Country for spring and summer and returned to the coast for autumn and winter, but not all people left their territory each year with some deciding to stay by the coast. Migrations provided a varied diet with plentiful seafood, seals and birds on the coast, and good hunting for kangaroos, wallabies and possums inland.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=17}} The High Country also provided opportunities to trade for ochre with the North-west and North people, and to harvest intoxicating gum from ''[[Eucalyptus gunnii]]'', found only on the plateau.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|pp=10\u201311}} The key determinant of camp sites was [[topography]]. The majority of camps were along river valleys, adjacent north facing hill slopes and on gentle slopes bordering a forest or marsh (Brown 1986).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Clan\n! Territory\n!

The settlement was a failure, with the inland areas described as \"wet, cold and soggy\", while the coastal region was difficult to clear, as Superintendent Henry Hellyer noted the \"forest [was] altogether unlike anything I have seen in the Island\". However, in 1827 a port was established at Emu Bay. In 1828 Tarerenorerer (Eng:Walyer), a woman who had escaped from sealers, became the leader of the Emu Bay people and attacked the settlers with stolen weapons, the first recorded use of muskets by Aboriginal people.{{sfn|Burnie City Council}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

To the west the nation was bounded by the escarpment of the Great Western Tiers, to the north-east the boundaries are less certain; with the eastern Tamar appearing to have been occupied by the Letteremairrener as far east as Piper's River: where the Poremairrenerner clan of the North-east nation were resident.{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|pp=18\u201319}}\nThe occupation of the western Tamar is open to dispute -  the ethnographic record suggests that it was the province of the Pallitorre and Parnillerpanner clans of the North nation; or the Leterrmairrener; or a hitherto unnamed clan of the North Midlands nation.{{sfn|Kee|1990}} It is likely that the west Tamar valley, or the Meander river valley formed the NNW boundaries of the North Midlands nation - with the arc of highlands formed by Cluan Tier and Dry's Bluff forming the nor-western extremity of their country.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|pp=18\u201319}}\nTo the east the natural boundary was the South-Esk River and, running northwards, the high tier of Mts Barrow, Arthur and Tippogoree Hills: beyond which lay the North-east nation. Running south past the eastern bend of the South-Esk it appears that the North Midlands Nation held land to some extent along the south bank of the Esk, at least as far as Avoca and possibly as far as the natural boundary of the St Pauls River, beyond which the Oyster Bay nation were resident.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}\nTo the south their country was constrained by the uplands beyond Tunbridge, as the plains narrow towards Big River and Oyster Bay country.{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|pp=18\u201320}}\n\n====Language of the North Midlands nation====\nThe North Midlands language is classified as \"mairremenner\" and was spoken by the Ben Lomond and North-east nations and also the Luggermairrenerpairer clan of the Central Highlands. This language group is likely to be a derivation of three other Tasmanian languages.{{sfn|Breen|Summer|2006}}\n\n====Clans of the North Midlands nation====\nThree major national divisions are generally ascribed to the North Midlands nation although it is likely that more clans existed and Ryan (2012) asserts the possibility of another two clan territories.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}} What is known of the composition of the North Midlands nation derives from settler description (who ascribed simple tribal divisions based upon locality), direct attribution from contemporary Tasmanian Aborigines (recorded by [[George Augustus Robinson|Robinson]] collated by [[Brian Plomley|Plomley]]) and later research by [[Rhys Jones (archaeologist)|Rhys Jones]]. From this we can be certain that there were three major clan divisions, described by colonials as the Port Dalrymple Tribe (Leterrermairrener Clan), at the Tamar River; Pennyroyal Creek Tribe (Panninher), at Norfolk Plains; and the Stony Creek Tribe (Tyrrernotepanner), at Campbell Town.\n\n=====The Letteremairrener \"Port Dalrymple\" Clan=====\nThe Letteremairrener (Letter-ramare-ru-nah) Clan occupied country from Low Head to modern day Launceston. In colonial times reports were made of clusters of huts, up to ten in number, in the Tamar valley and there are extensive archeological remains of occupation on both sides of the Tamar river and north coastal country.{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}}\n\n======Toponymy======\nLittle is recorded of the toponymy of their country but some local placenames have survived and are likely to be of the \"Nara\" language group.\n* Tamar River: kunermurluker, morerutter, ponrabbel{{sfn|Plomley|1992a}}\n* Low Head: Pilerwaytackenter\n* Georgetown area: Kennemerthertackenloongentare\n* Launceston (Port Dalrymple): Taggener, Lorernulraytitteter\n* North-Esk River: Lakekeller\n* Mt Barrow: Pialermaligena\n\n======Significant sites======\nLittle is known of specific sites of significance to the Letteremairrener, but contemporary Palawa assert the significance of the [[Cataract Gorge]]{{sfn|Breen|Summer|2006}}{{sfn|Clarke|2015}}\nas a place of [[Aboriginal ceremony|ceremony]] and significance. Certainly, in 1847, when a surviving Aboriginal \"chief\" was temporarily returned to Launceston from exile in Wybalenna, he requested to be taken to the Cataract Gorge and was described as being jubilant at return to the Gorge, followed with apparent lamentation at what had been lost to him.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|p=?}}{{sfn|Richards|Johnson|2007|p=63}}\nThere are no recorded significant archeological remains in the Gorge precinct, although the area was subject to significant seasonal flooding before damming.{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}}\n\nThe Letteremairrener had been recorded to have specific meeting places at Paterson's Plains (near modern-day St Leonards){{sfn|Breen|Summer|2006}} and groups as large as 150 had been recorded in colonial times in this vicinity.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|p=?}} The Clan country overlapped with that of the Panninher and Tyrrernotepanner and it is likely that, at times, the clans shared resources across clan borders.{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}}\n\n======Colonial contact======\nThe Letteremairrener were among the first Tasmanian Aboriginals to be affected by the impact of colonisation by the British as colonial occupation commenced at Port Dalrymple and progressed to Launceston, with settlers progressively occupying land up the Tamar valley.\nBy the early 1800s the Letteremairrener had been involved in skirmishes with exploratory parties of colonials, in the second decade of that century they had reached some accommodation with the interlopers; and were observed practicing spear throwing near present-day Paterson Barracks and watching colonial women wash clothes at Cataract Gorge.{{sfn|Bethell|1957}}\nBetween 1811 and 1827 several aboginal children were baptised in Launceston, either abducted or the progeny of settler/aboriginal liaison.\nBy 1830 the people of the Letteremairenner had largely disappeared from their homeland and the survivors were waging a desperate guerrilla war with colonial British, living a fringe existence in Launceston or living life on the margin at the peripheries of their traditional land.\nBy 1837 the Letteremairrenner had disappeared completely from the Tamar Valley and would eventually die in the squalor of Wybalenna or Oyster Cove.\n\n=====The Panninher \"Pennyroyal Creek\" Clan=====\nThe Panninher (parn-in-her) were known to colonial people as the Penny Royal Creek Tribe, named eponymously from the river that comes off the Western Tiers south of Drys Bluff (which is now called the [[Liffey River, Tasmania|Liffey River]]). The Panninher named the Liffey river ''tellerpanger'' and Drys Bluff, the mountain rearing above their homeland, was ''taytitkekitheker''. Their territory broadly covered the north plains of the midlands from the west bank of the Tamar River across to what is now Evandale and terminating at the Tyerrernotepanner country around modern day Conara.{{sfn|Kee|1990}}\n\nThe Panninher also freely moved from the Tamar to the central highlands and brokered trade in ochre from the Toolumbunner mine to neighbouring clans.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}\nRobinson describes the aboriginal road used by the Panninher from their home up to the Central Highlands, via the gully of the Liffey river, and the South road along the base of the Western Tiers - up the Lake River to modern day Interlaken.\n\n======Significant sites======\nWhilst sites of ritual significance to the Panninher are not known, the Panninher were known to frequent Native Point, on the [[South Esk River]] between modern day [[Perth, Tasmania|Perth]] and [[Evandale, Tasmania|Evandale]], where flint quarries were located and clans met for celebration.{{sfn|Roth|1899}} Here local historians believe that cemetery (hollowed) trees were used to inter the dead.{{sfn|Haygarth|2013|pp=4\u20135}}\nSimilarly, Reibey's Ford, near modern-day [[Hadspen]], was a known \"resort of the natives\" and they named this site ''moorronnoe''.{{sfn|Plomley|1992a}} Archaeological evidence shows also indicates signs of continuous occupation at permanent lagoons near Cleveland,{{sfn|Kee|1990}} which was known historically as a clan meeting place.{{sfn|Kee|1990}}{{sfn|Stancombe|1968}}\n\nThe Panninher were affected early by settlement around Norfolk Plains and aggressive assertion of property rights by settlers at first hindered their hunting and migration through their country and, subsequently, led to outright hostility from both parties. Captain Ritchie, an early settler near Perth, tolerated, or fostered, forays by his assigned men against the Panninher and this culminated in a massacre by settlers near modern-day Cressy.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}\nThe Panninher, or their neighbouring clansmen, retaliated in various attacks against settlers at Western Lagoon and in remote country up the Lake River, reaching a peak in aggression against the colonial interlopers by 1827.{{sfn|Clements|2014}}\nIn 1831 a war party of \"100 or 150 stout men\" attacked settlers at the base of the Western Tiers and up the Lake River{{sfn|Clements|2014}} but it is unclear whether this was the action of the Panninher alone or a confederation of warriors from remnant North Tasmanian nations. The colonial settlers made little discrimination between Panninher and members of the \"Stony Creek Tribe\" and it is likely that the North Midlands nation had disintegrated and the amalgamated band was known under the overarching name of \"Stony Creek Tribe\" by this time. This notwithstanding, it seems that the Panninher were resourceful enough to survive in some numbers until late in the Black War.\n\n=====The Tyerrernotepanner \"Stony Creek\" clan=====\nThe Tyerrernotepanner (Chera-noti-pana) were known to colonial people as the Stony Creek Tribe, named eponymously from the small southern tributary of the South Esk at Llewellyn, west of modern-day Avoca.{{sfn|Roth|1899}}\n\nThe clan Tyerrernotepanner were centred at [[Campbell Town, Tasmania|Campbell Town]] and were one of up to four clans in the south central Midlands area.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=?}}\nNevertheless, this clan name is now used as a general term for all aboriginal peoples of this region. The ethnographic and archaeological evidence describes areas of significance to the south central Midlands clans: modern day Lake Leake, Tooms Lake, Windfalls farm, Mt Morriston, Ross township{{sfn|Casella|2002|p=30}} and the lacustrine regions of the midlands all show evidence of tool knapping, middens and records of hut construction consistent with occupation.{{sfn|Kee|1990}}{{sfn|Plomley|2008}}\n\n===== Significant sites =====\nLake Leake (previously Kearney's Bogs), Campbell Town, Ellinthorpe Plains (near modern day Auburn) and Tooms Lake were described as \"resorts of the natives\" by settlers and showed substantial evidence of seasonal occupation.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=?}} Furthermore, several small lagoons in the midlands area all show substantial archeological evidence of regular occupation consistent with tool-making and semi-nomadic use. Aboriginal roads, ''markenner'', are described as passing up the Eastern Tiers to Swanport, up the Western Tier to Interlaken and up the Lake River to Woods Lake and thence to the Central Highlands.{{sfn|Kee|1990}}\n\nThe clan divisions of the southern central Midlands are suggested below. Caution must be exercised as to the provenance of the names and the complete accuracy of attributing discrete geographical regions.\n* ''tyrrernotepanner'': clan at Northern Campbell Town/Lake river/ South Fingal Valley\n* ''marwemairer'': clan at Ross/Mt Morriston region\n* ''peenrymairmener'': clan at Glen Morriston/Lake Leake\n* ''rolemairre'': clan at Tunbridge area{{sfn|Kee|1990}}{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|pp=23, 24}}\n\nThe Tyerrernotepanner are described consistently in contemporary records as a \"fierce tribe\" and the records describe consistent and concerted violence by the Tyerrernotepanner during the Black War. The Tyeerrernotepanner, along with clansmen from other remnant tribes, conducted raids across the midlands during the Black War and, until \"conciliated\" by Robinson, were the subject of fearful reminiscence by colonial people.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}\nThe famed aboriginal leader Umarrah was a member of this clan and he was noted for his aggression and sustained campaign against European interlopers - although he was raised by colonials himself.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Three clan names are known but their locations are somewhat conjectural - the clans were recorded as Plangermaireener, Plindermairhemener and Tonenerweenerlarmenne.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=32}}{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=1005}}\n\nThe Plangermaireener clan is recorded as variously inhabiting the south-east aspect of the Ben Lomond region and also has been associated with the Oyster Bay or Cape Portland Clans to the east - indeed the chief [[Mannalargenna]] is variously described as a chief of the Oyster Bay, Cape Portland and Ben Lomond nations.{{sfn|Mannalargenna}}{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=20}}\nPlangermaireener is also used as a blanket term for the Ben Lomond nation, which reflects the suffix \"mairreener\"; meaning \"people\".{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|p=13}}\n\nThe Plindermairhemener are recorded in association with the south and south-western aspects of the region{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=1005}}{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|p=20}}{{sfn|Kee|1991|p=?}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|p=125}} and the location of the Tonenerweenerlarmenne is uncertain, but were probably centred in the remaining Ben Lomond nation territory from White Hills to the headwaters of the North and South-Esk rivers or the upper South-Esk Valley.{{sfn|Syme|Ball|Elder|2012}}\nThis notwithstanding, the Palawa were a nomadic people and likely occupied these lands seasonally.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=32}}\n\nThe Ben Lomond nation is sometimes described as the Ben Lomond/Pennyroyal Creek nation from an entry in [[George Augustus Robinson|Robinson]]'s journal:\n'(Mannalargenna) ... said that \"the smoke...was that of the Ben Lomond-Pennyroyal Creek natives\"'{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=315}}\n\nThis is a misnomer, as the Pennyroyal Creek was the original European name for the [[Liffey River (Tasmania)|Liffey River]] and the Pennyroyal Creek Tribe was the contemporary name of the Panninher Clan of the North Midlands nation.{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|p=31}}{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=1011}}\nMannalargenna would be familiar with the clans neighbouring his own traditional country and could be relied upon to report accurately the composition of the clanspeople in question. It is plausible that when Robinson was writing in 1830 the remnant peoples of the Ben Lomond nation had federated with that of the Panninher and this was the provenance of the conjoined title.\n\n====Seasonal movement====\nThe clans of the Ben Lomond nation were nomadic and the Aborigines hunted along the valleys of the [[South Esk River|South Esk]] and [[North Esk River|North Esk]] rivers, their tributaries and the highlands to the northeast; as well as making forays to the plateau in summer. There are records of aboriginal huts or dwellings around the foothills of [[Stacks Bluff]] and around the headwaters of the South Esk River near modern-day Mathinna.{{sfn|Kee|1991|p=?}} On the plateau there is evidence of artifacts around Lake Youl that suggests regular occupation of this site by aborigines after the last ice age.{{sfn|Kee|1991|p=?}} The clans of the Ben Lomond nation had close enough relationships with neighbouring clans of the East Coast and North Midlands that they enjoyed seasonal foraging rights to these adjoining territories.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=32}} [[John Batman]] describes the seasonal movement of the Plangermaireener in his diary of May 1830:\n\n''\"...the tribe travels around Ben Lomond from South Esk to North Esk - and from thence to St. Patricks Head - Georges Bay and round the East Coast\"''{{sfn|Kee|1991|p=?}}\n\nBatman further describes the relationship between the clans of the Ben Lomond nation and the North East nation:\n\n''\"...there is (sic) two tribes... they (the 'chiefs' ) are upon friendly terms and often stop and meet and talk 10 days together...\"''{{sfn|Kee|1991|p=?}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There is eyewitness evidence that the South East nation may have consisted of up to ten clans, totalling around 500 people. However, only four groups totalling 160\u2013200 people were officially recorded as the main source by Robinson, whose journals begin in 1829. By this time, Europeans had settled in most of the South East tribe's country, with the country dispossessed and food resources depleted. Their country contained the most important [[silcrete]], [[chert]] and [[quartzite]] mines in Tasmania.{{sfn|Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Survey|2001}}\nThe South East people had a hostile relationship with the Oyster Bay people whom they frequently raided, often to kidnap women.{{sfn|Refshauge|1804}}\n[[Trugernanner|Truganini]] was a Nuenonne from [[Bruny Island]], which they called ''Lunawanna-Alonnah''. The first two European towns built on the island were named Lunawanna and Alonnah, and most of the island's landmarks are named after Nuenonne people. The island was the source of the [[sandstone]] used to build many of [[Melbourne]]'s buildings, such as the Post Office and Parliament House.<ref>''Tasmania''. Regional Guide Series.

Aboriginal culture was disrupted severely in the 19th century after dispossession of land and incarceration of Aboriginal people on Wybalenna and Oyster Cove. Much traditional knowledge has irrevocably disappeared and what remains has been nurtured over several generations starting with the aboriginal wives of sealers on the Furneaux Islands.\n\nBut, as the Aboriginal writer Greg Lehman states, \"Aboriginal culture (is not) past tense.\" Aboriginal people, in a variety of forms, continue to express their culture in unique ways - expressing themes that lament the past but also celebrate endurance and continuity of culture into the future.{{sfn|Reynolds|2006}}\n\n===Pre-colonial contact===\nContemporary accounts of the ceremonial and cultural life of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people are very limited. There were no observers trained in the social sciences after the French expeditions in the 18th century had made formal study of Tasmanian Aboriginal culture. Moreover, those who wrote most comprehensively of Aboriginal life in the 19th century did so after colonial contact, and the ensuing violence and dislocation, had irrevocably altered traditional aboriginal culture. Those that most closely observed Aboriginal cultural practices either did not write accounts of what they observed or, if they did, observed culture through the ethnocentric lens of religious and proselytising 19th century European men.\n\n==== Mythology ====\nThe mythology of the Aboriginal Tasmanians appears to be complex and possibly specific to each clan group. One of their creation myths refers to two creator deities, Moinee and Droemerdene; the children of Parnuen, the sun, and Vena, the moon.{{sfn|Haynes|2000|pp=53\u201390}}{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=436}}\n\nMoinee appears as the primeval creator, forming the land and rivers of Tasmania and fashioning the first man, Parlevar - embodied from a spirit residing in the ground. This form was similar to a [[kangaroo]], and Aboriginal people consequently take the kangaroo as a totem.{{sfn|Lehman|2006}} Similarly, Moinee then created the kangaroo, who emerged, like the first man, from the soil.\n\nDroemerdene appears as the star Canopus who helped the first men to change from their kangaroo-like form. He removed their tails and fashioned their knee joints \"so that they could rest\" and thus man achieved differentiation form the kangaroo.{{sfn|Lehman|2006}}\n\nMoinee fought with his brother Droemerdene, and many \"devils\", after Droemerdene changed the shape of the first men and Moinee was finally hurled to his death from the sky to take form as a standing stone at Cox Bight. Droemerdene subsequently fell into the sea at Louisa Bay.{{sfn|Haynes|2000|pp=53\u201390}}\nToogee Low (Port Davey) remained in mythology as a residence of many \"devils\".\n\nTasmanian Aboriginal mythology also records in their [[oral history]] that the first men emigrated by land from a far-off country and the land was subsequently flooded - an echo of the Tasmanian people's migration from mainland Australia to (then) peninsular Tasmania, and the submergence of the land bridge after the last ice age.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=514}}\n\n==== Spirituality ====\nLittle has been recorded of traditional Tasmanian Aboriginal spiritual life. Colonial British recorded that Aboriginal people describe topographical features, such as valleys and caves, as being inhabited by spiritual entities recorded by contemporaries as \"sprites\". Furthermore, Robinson recorded members of some clans as having animistic regard for certain species of tree within their domain.\nRobinson recorded several discussions regarding spiritual entities that his companions describe as having agency or a source of interpretive power to aid their navigation of their physical world. The Tasmanian Aboriginal people would describe these entities as \"devils\" and related that these spiritual beings as walking alongside aboriginal people \"carrying a torch but could not be seen\".{{sfn|Plomley|2008}}\n\nMannarlargenna, in particular, described consulting his \"devil\" which seems to be a resident personal spirituality that provided prognostic or oracular powers.\nThe \"devil\" might also be used to describe malevolent spiritual entities in the Aboriginal cosmos.\n\nAboriginal people recounted that there was a prime malevolent spirit called ''rageowrapper'', who appeared as a large black (Aboriginal?) man and is associated with the darkness. ''Rageowrapper'' might appear borne on a strong wind or be the source of severe illness{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=52}}\nthis malign spirit might be released from a sick individual by cutting the skin to \"let him out\".{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=319}}\n\nSeveral researchers assert that there was belief in a kind of manichean cosmos with a \"good\" and \"bad\" spirit - delineated by day and night - although this may reflect the cultural bias of the observers. Milligan (a contemporary at Wyballenna) described a creator spirit called ''tiggana marrabona'' - translating as \"twilight man\" but as referred to above there are a number of supernatural beings associated with creation.{{sfn|Worms|1960|pp=1\u201316}}\n\nEtymological study of Milligan's ethnographic data describes a pantheon of spiritual beings associated with environmental or supernatural phenomena:\n\n* ''nama burag''                   - or \"the ghost of the thunderstorm\"\n* ''ragi roba''                        - (see rageowrapper) the \"revered spirit\" - frequently connoted to awesome/revered/dreaded and a signifier of ghosts/phantoms of the departed when connected with signifier ''ragi''{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=7}}\n* ''laga robana''                    - \"awful spirit of the dead\" i.e. the dead man, some kind of dreaded spirit, malevolent phantom{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=8}}\n* ''maian ginja''                     - \"the killer\" - translates also to fiend/demon: bringer of death{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=9}}\n* ''muran bugana luwana''    - \"the bright spirit of the night\" - a kind of benign or ebullient entity, often described of female form \"clothed in grass\"{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=10}}\n* ''wara wana''                      - \"the spirit being\" - also ''warrawah'' translates to transcendental/ethereal/spirit of dead associated with celestial bodies- may be malevolent{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=11}}\n* ''badenala''                        - \"shadow man\" - ghost or spirit{{sfn|Worms|1960|pp=1\u201316}}\n* ''kana tana''                       - \"the bone man\" - Western Nation language term for spirit of the dead{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=14}}\n* ''nangina''                          - \"shadow/ghost\" - contemporary association with \"fairy\" or \"elf\" - a supernatural entity dwelling \"in the hill - dancing (and) fond of children\"{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=14}}\n* ''buga nubrana''                 - \"the man's eye\" - associated with the sun - possibly a benign entity{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=15}}\n\nTraditional Aboriginal Tasmanians also related beliefs of a spiritual afterlife. One such belief, related by an Aboriginal person from the west coastal nation, was that the spirit of the dead travelled to a place over the sea: to the far north-west, called ''Moo-ai''. This possibly reflects the ancestral memory of the ''Mara'' language group, resident in Western Tasmania, who are believed to have settled Tasmania from the Warrnambool region in modern day Victoria,{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=498}} but other Tasmanians state that after death their spirits would have a post-corporeal existence in their traditional lands.{{sfn|Plomley|1991}}{{sfn|Roe}}<br /> Other references are made to an Island of the Dead, ''tini drini'', described as \"an island in Bass Strait\" where the dead would be reincarnated or \"jump up white men\". White here does not refer to European, but rather the skeletal or phantasmic nature of returned dead.{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=12}}\n\n==== Funeral customs ====\nThe dead might be cremated or interred in a hollow tree or rock grave, dependent on clan custom.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=540}}\nAboriginal people were also recorded to keep bones of dead people as [[talisman]]s or amulets. The bones might be worn on a kangaroo sinew string bare around the neck or enclosed in a kangaroo skin bag.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=70}}\n\n==== Cosmology ====\nTraditional Tasmanian Aboriginals saw the night sky as residence of creator spirits (see above) and also describe constellations that represent tribal life; such as figures of fighting men and courting couples.{{sfn|Plomley|2008}}\n\n=== Material culture ===\n==== Use of fire ====\nThe Tasmanian Aboriginal people preferred to store coals in wrapped bark for the purpose of starting fires. This was likely due to the difficulty in creating fire in Tasmania's wet maritime climate. When this source of flame was extinguished they would seek to gain fire from neighbouring hearths or clans but also were likely to have created fire by friction methods{{sfn|Cotton|1887}}{{sfn|Taylor|2008b}}{{sfn|Gott|2002|pp=650\u2013656}}{{sfn|Breen|1992|pp=40\u201343}}{{sfn|Plomley|1991|p=106}} and possibly by mineral percussion.{{sfn|Volger|1973|pp=58\u201363}}{{sfn|Taylor|2008b}}{{sfn|Plomley|1991|p=106}} This practice gave rise to the myth that the native Tasmanians had \"lost\" the ability to make fire.{{sfn|Taylor|2008b|pp=1\u201326}} The Tasmanian Aboriginal people extensively employed fire for cooking, warmth, tool hardening and [[Fire-stick farming|clearing vegetation]] to encourage and control macropod herds.{{sfn|Gammage|2008|pp=241\u2013254}} This farming may have caused the [[Gymnoschoenus sphaerocephalus|buttongrass plains]] in southwest Tasmania to develop to their current extent.{{sfn|McBey|2018}}\n\n==== Hunting and diet ====\nApproximately 4,000 years ago, the Aboriginal Tasmanians largely dropped scaled fish from their diet, and began eating more land mammals, such as [[Phalangeriformes|possums]], [[kangaroos]], and [[Wallaby|wallabies]]. Aboriginal Tasmanians had employed bone tools, but it appears that they switched from worked [[bone tools]] to sharpened [[stone tools]],{{sfn|Ryan|1996}} as the effort to make bone tools began to exceed the benefit they provided.{{sfn|Manne|2003}} The significance of the disappearance of bone tools (believed to have been primarily used for fishing related activities) and fish in the diet is heavily debated. Some argue that it is evidence of a [[maladaptation|maladaptive]] society, while others argue that the change was economic, as large areas of scrub at that time were changing to grassland, providing substantially increased food resources. Fish were never a large part of the diet, ranking behind shellfish and seals, and with more resources available, the [[Labor theory of value|cost/benefit ratio]] of fishing may have become too high.{{sfn|Manne|2003}}\nArchaeological evidence indicates that around the time these changes took place, the Tasmanian people began expanding their territories, a process that was still continuing when Europeans arrived.{{sfn|Australian Bureau of Statistics|2002}}\n\n==== Basket making ====\nBasket making is a traditional craft which has been carried through into contemporary art. Baskets had many uses, including carrying food, women's and men's tools, shells, ochre, and eating utensils. Basket-like carriers were made from plant materials, kelp, or animal skin. The kelp baskets or carriers were used mainly to carry water and as drinking vessels.\n\nPlants were carefully selected to produce strong, thin, narrow strips of fibre of suitable length for basket making.\n\nSeveral different species of plant were used, including white flag iris, blue flax lily, rush and sag, some of which are still used by contemporary basket makers, and sometimes shells are added for ornamental expression.{{sfn|Tasmanian art online}}\n\n====Tasmanian Aboriginal shell necklace art====\nMaking necklaces from shells is a significant cultural tradition among Tasmanian Aboriginal women.{{sfn|National Museum of Australia}}\nNecklaces were used for adornment, as gifts and tokens of honour, and as trading objects. Dating back at least 2,600 years, necklace-making is one of the few Palawa traditions that has remained intact and has continued without interruption since before European settlement.{{sfn|National Museum of Australia}}\nA number of shell necklaces are held in the collection of the [[National Museum of Australia]].{{sfn|National Museum of Australia}}\n\n==== Ochre ====\n[[Ochre]] is an important cultural resource for the Tasmanian Aboriginal community. Traditionally, Aboriginal women had the exclusive role of obtaining ochre. Today, many Tasmanian Aboriginal men continue to respect the traditional cultural custom by obtaining ochre from women only.\n\nTasmanian ochre ranges in colour from white through yellow to red. It has many uses, including ceremonial body marking, colouring wood craft products, tie-dyeing and various other uses in crafts and arts. Tasmanian Aboriginal people consider ochre to be a special cultural resource.{{sfn|Tasmanian art online}}\n\nTraditionally, Aboriginal people have sourced ochre from sites throughout Tasmania. The most celebrated site is Toolumbunner in the Gog Range in NW Tasmania. This site lies in the traditional lands of the Pallitorre Clan and was a significant site of ochre mining, tribal meeting, celebration and trading.{{sfn|Sagona|1994}}\n\n==== Ceremony ====\nColonial settlers describe various [[Aboriginal Australian ceremonies|ceremonies enacted by Aboriginal people]]. Tasmanians would gather for ceremony that contemporaries called \"[[corroboree|corobery]]\", although that is a mainland Aboriginal word adopted by British settlers. Dance and singing was a feature of these ceremonies and dance would encompass reenactment of traditional tales and also recent events.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=706}}\nRobinson describes reenactment of a horseman hunting an Aboriginal person via the display of the \"horse-dance\" as well as the sensual \"devil-dance\" performed by women from the Furneaux islands{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=579}}\n\nBattle and funeral was also the time for painting the body with ochre or black paint. The important ceremonial meaning of painting the body can be inferred by record of discussion at the funeral for the Aboriginal man \"Robert\", in Launceston, where an Aboriginal mourner was asked by a settler why he painted his body for the funeral and he replied \"what do you wear fine clothes for?\"{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=626}}\n\n==== Visual art ====\nContemporary colonial settlers relate several examples of pictorial art drawn on the insides of huts or on remnants of discarded paper. These designs are generally circular or spiral motifs that represent celestial bodies or figures of clans-people. Robinson related that one design in an aboriginal hut was very accurately drawn and was created via the use of a kind of wooden compass.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=575}}\n\nThe most enduring art form left by Tasmanians are [[petroglyph]]s, or rock art. The most elaborate site is at Preminghana on the West Coast, although other significant sites exist at the Bluff in Devonport and at Greenes Creek. Smaller sites include the cupules at ''meenamatta'' Blue Tier and isolated circle motifs at Trial Harbour.{{sfn|Bednarick|2007|pp=161\u2013170}}\n\nAboriginal people inhabited Tasmania's South-west from the last glacial maximum and hand stencils and ochre smears are found in several caves, the oldest of which is dated to 10000 years ago.{{sfn|Jones|1995}}\n{{pp-semi|small=yes}}\n\n=== Modern Tasmanian Aboriginal culture ===\n==== Visual art ====\nTasmanian Aboriginal people are asserting their identity and culture through the visual arts. The art expresses the Aboriginal viewpoint on colonial history, race relations and identity. Themes consistent in modern Tasmanian Aboriginal art are loss, kinship, narratives of dispossession but also survival. The art is modern, using textiles, sculpture and photography but often incorporates ancient motifs and techniques such as shell necklaces and practical artifacts.{{sfn|Humphries|2015}}{{sfn|Gough|2012}}\n<br />\nPhotographer Ricky Maynard has had his work exhibited internationally and his documentary style \"brings to light the stories of Aboriginal people where they have previously been absent or distorted. His photographs mark historical sites, events and figures of great significance to Tasmanian and mainland Aboriginal people, and speak to their struggle in a subtle, poetic, and powerful way.\"{{sfn|Ricky Maynard}}\n<br />\nModern painting in Tasmania is starting to use techniques shared by Aboriginal art in mainland Australia but incorporating traditional Tasmanian motifs, such as spirals and celestial representation.{{sfn|Rosalind Langford - Connecting Spirits}}\nThis shows that, like mainland Australia, Aboriginal art is dynamic and evolving from established post-colonial preconceptions.\n\nTasmanian Aboriginal women have traditionally collected ''Maireener'' shells to fashion necklaces and bracelets.\nThis practice continues by Aboriginal women whose families survived on the Furneaux Islands, handed down by elder women to maintain an important link with traditional lifestyle.\nLate in the nineteenth century a number of women aimed to keep this part of their traditional culture alive in order to allow their daughters and granddaughters to participate in their cultural heritage. Today, there are only a few Tasmanian Aboriginal women who maintain this art, but they continue to hand down their knowledge and skills to younger women in their community. Shell necklace manufacture continues to maintain links with the past but is expressed as a modern art form.{{sfn|Tasmanian aboriginal art}}\n\n==== Writing ====\nThe earliest publication attributed to Tasmanian authors, predating the journalism of [[David Unaipon]] by a century, was ''The Aboriginal/Flinders Island Chronicle'', written between September 1836 and December 1837, though it is unclear to what degree its composition was influenced by \"The Commandant\", George Robinson.{{sfn|Miller|2010|p=9}}\n\nTasmanian Aboriginal authors in the past century have written history, poetry, essays and fiction. Authors such as Ida West{{sfn|West|1987}} have written autobiographies recounting their experiences growing up within white society; Phyllis Pitchford, Errol West{{efn|\"In the 1970s a young Tasmanian Aborigine, Errol West, wrote a beautiful poem, ''The Moon Birds of Big Dog Island'', about the great gaping absence that was being a Tasmanian Aborigine.\"}}{{sfn|Flanagan|2002}} and Jim Everett have written poetry, while Everett and Greg Lehman have explored their tradition as essayists.{{sfn|Thornley|2010|p=259}}{{sfn|Lehman|2006}}\n\n==Legislated definition==\nIn June 2005, the [[Tasmanian Legislative Council]] introduced an innovated definition of aboriginality into the Aboriginal Lands Act.{{sfn|Tasmanian Legislation \u2013 Aboriginal Lands Act 199}}\nThe bill was passed to allow Aboriginal Lands Council elections to commence, after uncertainty over who was \"aboriginal\", and thus eligible to vote.\n\nUnder the bill, a person can claim \"Tasmanian Aboriginality\" if they meet the following criteria:\n* Ancestry\n* Self-identification\n* Community recognition\n\n==Government compensation for \"Stolen Generations\"==\nOn 13 August 1997 a Statement of Apology (specific to removal of children) was issued \u2013 which was unanimously supported by the Tasmanian Parliament \u2013 the wording of the sentence was\n\n{{quote|That this house, on behalf of all Tasmanian(s)... expresses its deep and sincere regret at the hurt and distress caused by past policies under which Aboriginal children were removed from their families and homes; apologises to the Aboriginal people for those past actions and reaffirms its support for reconciliation between all Australians.}}\n\nThere are many people currently working in the community, academia, various levels of government and NGOs to strengthen what has been termed as the Tasmanian Aboriginal culture and the conditions of those who identify as members of the descendant community.\n\nIn November 2006 Tasmania became the first Australian state or territory to offer financial compensation for the [[Stolen Generations]], Aboriginal people forcibly removed from their families by Australian government agencies and church missions between about 1900 and 1972.

For much of the 20th century, the Tasmanian Aboriginal people were widely, and erroneously, thought of as being an extinct cultural and ethnic group.{{sfn|Lehman|2006}} Contemporary figures (2016) for the number of people of Tasmanian Aboriginal descent vary according to the criteria used to determine this identity, ranging from 6,000 to over 23,000.{{sfn|Shine|2017}}{{sfn|Hunt|2017}}\n\nFirst arriving in Tasmania (then a peninsula of Australia) around 40,000 years ago, the ancestors of the Aboriginal Tasmanians were cut off from the [[mainland Australia|Australian mainland]] by rising sea levels c. 6000&nbsp;BC. They were entirely isolated from the rest of the human race for 8,000 years until European contact.\n\nBefore [[British colonisation of Tasmania]] in 1803, there were an estimated 3,000\u201315,000 Palawa.{{efn|[[Rhys Jones (archaeologist)|Rhys Jones]]: 3,000\u20135,000, [[Brian Plomley|N.

Plomley]]: 4,000\u20136,000, [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]]: 5,000\u20137,000, Colin Pardoe: 12,000+ and David Davies: 15,000. {{harv|Madley|2008|p=78, n.7}}}} The Palawa population suffered a drastic drop in numbers within three decades, so that by 1835 only some 400 full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal people survived, most of this remnant being incarcerated in camps where all but 47 died within the following 12 years.{{sfn|Madley|2008|p=78}} No consensus exists as to the cause, over which [[History wars|a major controversy]] arose.{{efn|\"Despite over 170 years of debate over who or what was responsible for this near-extinction, no consensus exists on its origins, process, or whether or not it was genocide\". {{harv|Madley|2008|p=78}}}} The traditional view, still affirmed, held that this dramatic demographic collapse was the result of the impact of introduced diseases, rather than the consequence of policy.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|pp=84\u201385}}{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|p=388}}{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=66\u201367}}{{sfn|Windschuttle|2002|pp=372\u2013376}}{{efn|Tasmanian novelist [[Richard Flanagan]] is also skeptical of the notion of genocide, if understood as an accomplished extermination:\"Tasmania is still frequently - and wrongly - cited as the site of the only successful genocide in history..\" {{harv|Flanagan|2002}}}} [[Geoffrey Blainey]], for example, wrote that by 1830 in Tasmania: \"Disease had killed most of them but warfare and private violence had also been devastating.\"{{sfn|Blainey|1980|p=75}}{{sfn|Rouse|2003|p=45}} [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] attributed the depletion to losses in the [[Black War]].{{sfn|Tatz|2003|p=79}} [[Keith Windschuttle]] claimed that in addition to disease, the prostitution of women in a society already in decline, explained the extinction.{{sfn|Johnson|McFarlane|2015|p=?}} Many specialists in the history of colonialism and genocide, such as [[Ben Kiernan]], [[Colin Tatz]], and Benjamin Madley state that the Tasmanian decimation qualifies as genocide in terms of the definition set forth by [[Raphael Lemkin]] and adopted in the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Genocide Convention]].{{sfn|Kiernan|2008|pp=265ff}}{{sfn|Tatz|2003|pp=78\u201379}}{{sfn|Lawson|2014|pp=1ff,31ff.}}{{efn|\"In light of the U.N. definition, sufficient evidence exists to designate the Tasmanian catastrophe genocide.\" {{harv|Madley|2008|p=104}}}}\n\nBy 1833, [[George Augustus Robinson]], sponsored by [[Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania|Lieutenant-Governor]] [[George Arthur]], had persuaded the approximately 200 surviving Aboriginal Tasmanians to surrender themselves with assurances that they would be protected, be provided for and eventually have their lands returned to them. These \"assurances\" were false; there is no suggestion that Robinson or Lieutenant-Governor Arthur intended anything else but exile to the [[Furneaux Group|Furneaux Islands]], and the assurances were given by Robinson in order to facilitate the removal of the Aboriginal people from mainland Tasmania.{{sfn|Boyce|2009|p=297}} The survivors were moved to [[Wybalenna Island|Wybalenna]] Aboriginal Establishment on [[Flinders Island]], where diseases continued to reduce their numbers even further. In 1847, the last 47 living inhabitants of Wybalenna were transferred to [[Oyster Cove, Tasmania|Oyster Cove]], south of [[Hobart]]. Two individuals, [[Truganini]] (1812\u20131876) and [[Fanny Cochrane Smith]] (1834\u20131905), are separately considered to have been the last people solely of Tasmanian descent.{{efn|For discussion of the Truganini claim, and the other candidates, Suke and Fanny Cochrane Smith, see {{harvnb|Taylor|2008a|pp=140ff.}}}}{{efn|Lyndall Ryan denies Truganini was the last \"full-blood\" and makes a case for ''Suke'' (d. circa 1888) {{harv|Ryan|1996|p=220}}}}\n\nThe complete [[Tasmanian languages|Aboriginal Tasmanian languages]] have been lost; some original Tasmanian language words remained in use with Palawa people in the [[Furneaux Group|Furneaux Islands]], and there are some efforts to [[Palawa kani|reconstruct a language]] from the available wordlists. Today, some thousands of people living in Tasmania describe themselves as Aboriginal Tasmanians, since a number of Palawa women bore children to European men in the Furneaux Islands and mainland Tasmania.\n\n==History==\n===Before European settlement===\n[[File:Bassian plain 14000 BP.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Shoreline of Tasmania and Victoria about 14,000 years ago as sea levels were rising showing some of the human archaeological sites \u2013 see [[Prehistory of Australia]]]]\n\nPeople crossed into Tasmania approximately 40,000 years, ago via a [[land bridge]] between the island and the rest of mainland Australia, during the [[Last Glacial Period]]. According to genetic studies, once the sea level rose, flooding the [[Bass Strait|Bassian Plain]], the people were left isolated for approximately 8,000 years, until the time of European exploration, during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.{{sfn|Pardoe|1991|pp=1\u201327}}\n\nUntil the 1980s, it was thought that Tasmania was only occupied relatively recently, but the discovery of 19,000-year-old deposits at [[Kutikina Cave|Kutikina (or Fraser) Cave]] demonstrated the Ice Age occupation of the highlands.{{sfn|Reynolds|2006|pp=58\u201363}}{{sfn|Johnson|McFarlane|2015|p=31}} In 1990, archaeologists excavated material in the Warreen Cave in the Maxwell River valley of the south-west, proving Aboriginal occupation from as early as 34,000 [[Before Present|BP]], making Aboriginal Tasmanians the southern-most population in the world during the [[Pleistocene]] era. Modern digs in southwest and central Tasmania turned up very abundant finds, affording \"the richest archaeological evidence from Pleistocene Greater Australia\" covering the period from 35,000 to 11,000 BP.{{sfn|Lourandos|1993|pp=72\u201373}}\n\n==== Migration chronology ====\nTasmania was colonised by successive waves of Aboriginal people from southern Australia during [[glacial maximum|glacial maxima]], when the sea was at its lowest. The archeological and geographic record suggests a period of drying, with the colder glacial period, with a desert extending from southern Australia into the midlands of Tasmania - with intermittent periods of wetter, warmer weather. People migrating from southern Australia into peninsular Tasmania would have crossed stretches of seawater and desert, and finally found oases in the King highlands (now King Island).\n\nThe archeological, geographic and linguistic record suggests a pattern of successive occupation of Tasmania, and coalescence of three ethnic or language groups into one broad group. Evidence for contest over territory is reflected by the presence of ''Nara'' (the broad western Tasmania language group) toponymy in ''Mara'' (the broad eastern language group) territory; for example - suggesting a pattern of occupation and hostile takeover that mirrors traditional hostilities during colonial times.\nColonial settlers found two main language groups in Tasmania upon their arrival, which correlates with the broader nation or clan divisions.\n* ''Pleistocene Palawa'' language group - first ethnic and language group in Tasmania - absorbed or displaced by successive invasions except for remnant group on Tasman peninsula. Absorbed population in Eastern Tasmania combined with \"victorian speakers\" to form '''\"Mara\"''' language group across broader eastern Tasmania\n* ''Furneaux speakers'' displace Palawa in N/E Tasmania as far south as Orford - themselves disappear or are absorbed into Mara language group -the ''Mara'' language group a composite of ''pleistocene palawa, Furneaux and Victorian''\n* '''''Nara''''' speakers invade, but are pushed back to western Tasmania - correlates with Western nation of Tasmanian Aboriginal people.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nAfter the sea rose to create Bass Strait, the Australian mainland and Tasmania became separate land masses, and the Aboriginal people who had migrated from mainland Australia became cut off from their cousins on the mainland. Archeological evidence suggests remnant populations on the King and Furneaux highlands being stranded by rising waters - later to die out.\n\n===Early European contact===\nAbel Jansen Tasman, credited as the first European to discover Tasmania (in 1642) and who named it Van Diemen's Land, did not encounter any of the Aboriginal Tasmanians when he landed.\nIn 1772, a French exploratory expedition under [[Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne|Marion Dufresne]] visited Tasmania. At first, contact with the Aboriginal people was friendly; however the Aboriginal Tasmanians became alarmed when another boat was dispatched towards the shore. It was reported that spears and stones were thrown and the French responded with musket fire, killing at least one Aboriginal person and wounding several others. Two later French expeditions led by [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] in 1792\u201393 and [[Nicolas Baudin]] in 1802 made friendly contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians; the d'Entrecasteaux expedition doing so over an extended period of time.{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=58\u201360}}\n\nThe ''Resolution'' under [[Tobias Furneaux|Captain Tobias Furneaux]] (part of an expedition led by [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]]) had visited in 1773 but made no contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians although gifts were left for them in unoccupied shelters found on Bruny Island. The first known British contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians was on Bruny Island by Captain Cook in 1777. The contact was peaceful. [[William Bligh|Captain William Bligh]] also visited Bruny Island in 1788 and made peaceful contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|pp=3\u20138}}\n\n===Contact with sealers on the north and east coasts===\nMore extensive contact between Aboriginal Tasmanians and Europeans resulted when British and American seal hunters began visiting the islands in Bass Strait as well as the northern and eastern coasts of Tasmania from the late 1790s. Shortly thereafter (by about 1800), sealers were regularly left on uninhabited islands in Bass Strait during the sealing season (November to May). The sealers established semi-permanent camps or settlements on the islands, which were close enough for the sealers to reach the main island of Tasmania in small boats and so make contact with the Aboriginal Tasmanians.{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=58\u201360,76}}\n\nTrading relationships developed between sealers and Tasmanian Aboriginal tribes. Hunting dogs became highly prized by the Aboriginal people, as were other exotic items such as flour, tea and tobacco. The Aboriginal people traded kangaroo skins for such goods. However, a trade in Aboriginal women soon developed. Many Tasmanian Aboriginal women were highly skilled in hunting seals, as well as in obtaining other foods such as seabirds, and some Tasmanian tribes would trade their services and, more rarely, those of Aboriginal men to the sealers for the seal-hunting season. Others were sold on a permanent basis. This trade incorporated not only women of the tribe engaged in the trade but also women abducted from other tribes. Some may have been given to incorporate the new arrivals into Aboriginal society through marriage.\n\nSealers engaged in raids along the coasts to abduct Aboriginal women and were reported to have killed Aboriginal men in the process. By 1810 seal numbers had been greatly reduced by hunting so most seal hunters abandoned the area, however a small number of sealers, approximately fifty mostly \"renegade sailors, escaped convicts or ex-convicts\", remained as permanent residents of the Bass Strait islands and some established families with Tasmanian Aboriginal women.{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=58\u201360}}\n\nSome of the women were taken back to the islands by the sealers involuntarily and some went willingly, as in the case of a woman called Tarerenorerer (Eng:Walyer). Differing opinions have been given on Walyer's involvement with the sealers. McFarlane writes that she voluntarily joined the sealers with members of her family, and was responsible for attacking Aboriginal people and white settlers alike.{{sfn|McFarlane|2008|p=119}} Ryan comes to a different conclusion, that Walyer had been abducted at Port Sorell by Aboriginal people and traded to the sealers for dogs and flour.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=141}} Walyer was later to gain some notoriety for her attempts to kill the sealers to escape their brutality. Walyer, a Punnilerpanner, joined the Plairhekehillerplue band after eventually escaping and went on to lead attacks on employees of the [[Van Diemen's Land Company]]. Walyer's attacks are the first recorded use of [[musket]]s by Aboriginal people. Captured, she refused to work and was banished to [[Penguin Island (Tasmania)|Penguin Island]]. Later imprisoned on [[Swan Island (Tasmania)|Swan Island]] she attempted to organise a rebellion. Although Aboriginal women were by custom forbidden to take part in war, several Aboriginal women who escaped from sealers became leaders or took part in attacks. According to Lyndall Ryan, the women traded to, or kidnapped by sealers became \"a significant dissident group\" against white authority.{{sfn|Merry|2003}}\n\nHistorian James Bonwick reported Aboriginal women who were clearly captives of sealers but he also reported women living with sealers who \"proved faithful and affectionate to their new husbands\", women who appeared \"content\" and others who were allowed to visit their \"native tribe\", taking gifts, with the sealers being confident that they would return.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|pp=295\u2013297}} Bonwick also reports a number of claims of brutality by sealers towards Aboriginal women including some of those made by Robinson.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|pp=295\u2013301}} An Aboriginal woman by the name of Bulrer related her experience to Robinson, that sealers had rushed her camp and stolen six women including herself \"the white men tie them and then they flog them very much, plenty much blood, plenty cry.\" Sealing captain, James Kelly, wrote in 1816 that the custom of the sealers was to each have \"two to five of these native women for their own use and benefit.\" A shortage of women available \"in trade\" resulted in abduction becoming common and in 1830 it was reported that at least fifty Aboriginal women were \"kept in slavery\" on the Bass Strait islands.{{sfn|Merry|2003}}\n<blockquote>\"Harrington, a sealer, procured ten or fifteen native women, and placed them on different islands in Bass's Straits, where he left them to procure skins; if, however, when he returned, they had not obtained enough, he punished them by tying them up to trees for twenty-four to thirty-six hours together, flogging them at intervals, and he killed them not infrequently if they proved stubborn.\" (H.W.Parker ''The Rise, Progress, and Present State of V. D. Land'' 1833){{sfn|Roth|1899}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThe raids for, and trade in, Aboriginal women contributed to the rapid depletion of the numbers of Aboriginal women in the northern areas of Tasmania, \"by 1830 only three women survived in northeast Tasmania among 72 men\",{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=58\u201360}} and thus contributed in a significant manner to the demise of the full-blooded Aboriginal population of Tasmania. However many modern day Aboriginal Tasmanians trace their descent from the 19th century sealer communities of Bass Strait.\n\nThere are numerous stories of the sealers' brutality towards the Aboriginal women; with some of these reports originating from Robinson. In 1830, Robinson seized 14 Aboriginal women from the sealers, planning for them to marry Aboriginal men at the Flinders Island settlement. [[Josephine Flood]], an archaeologist specialising in Australian mainland Aboriginal peoples, notes: \"he encountered strong resistance from the women as well as sealers\". The sealers sent a representative, [[James Munro (sealer)|James Munro]], to appeal to [[Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet|Governor Arthur]] and argue for the women's return on the basis that they wanted to stay with their sealer husbands and children rather than marry Aboriginal men unknown to them. Arthur ordered the return of some of the women. Shortly thereafter, Robinson began to disseminate stories, told to him by James Munro, of atrocities allegedly committed by the sealers against Aboriginal people and against Aboriginal women, in particular. [[Brian Plomley]], who edited Robinson's papers, expressed scepticism about these atrocities and notes that they were not reported to [[William Grant Broughton|Archdeacon Broughton]]'s 1830 committee of inquiry into violence towards Tasmanians. Abduction and ill-treatment of Aboriginal Tasmanians certainly occurred, but the extent is debated.{{sfn|Flood|2006|p=76}}\n\n===After European settlement===\n[[File:Dowling Natives of Tasmania.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Hawker Dowling|Robert Dowling]], ''Group of Natives of Tasmania'', 1859. Critic [[Bernard William Smith]] assessed the work as a \"history painting in the full sense of the word\", with the natives \"seated\u2014emblematic of their situation\u2014around the dying embers of a burnt-out log near a great blackened stump, and in the far left corner there is a leafless tree with shattered branches.\"{{sfn|Smith|1971|p=57}} ]]\nBetween 1803 and 1823, there were two phases of conflict between the Aboriginal people and the British colonists. The first took place between 1803 and 1808 over the need for common food sources such as oysters and kangaroos, and the second between 1808 and 1823, when only a small number of white females lived among the colonists, and farmers, sealers and whalers took part in the trading, and the abduction, of Aboriginal women as sexual partners. These practices also increased conflict over women among Aboriginal tribes. This in turn led to a decline in the Aboriginal population. Historian Lyndall Ryan records 74 Aboriginal people (almost all women) living with sealers on the Bass Strait islands in the period up to 1835.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=313}}\n\nBy 1816, kidnapping of Aboriginal children for labour had become widespread. In 1814, [[Governor]] [[Thomas Davey (governor)|Thomas Davey]] issued a proclamation expressing \"utter indignation and abhorrence\" in regards to the kidnapping of the children and in 1819 Governor [[William Sorell]] not only re-issued the proclamation but ordered that those who had been taken without parental consent were to be sent to Hobart and supported at government expense.{{sfn|Bringing them Home \u2013 The Report}}\nA number of young Aboriginal children were known to be living with settlers. An Irish sealer named Brien spared the life of the baby son of a native woman he had abducted, explaining, \"as (he) had stolen the dam he would keep the cub.\" When the child grew up he became an invaluable assistant to Brien but was considered \"no good\" by his own people as he was brought up to dislike Aboriginal people, whom he considered \"dirty lazy brutes.\"{{sfn|Merry|2003}} Twenty-six were definitely known (through baptismal records) to have been taken into settlers' homes as infants or very small children, too young to be of service as labourers. Some Aboriginal children were sent to the Orphan School in Hobart.{{sfn|Flood|2006|p=77}} Lyndall Ryan reports fifty-eight Aboriginal people, of various ages, living with settlers in Tasmania in the period up to 1835.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=176}}\n\nSome historians argue that European disease did not appear to be a serious factor until after 1829.{{sfn|Boyce|2009|p=65}} Other historians including [[Geoffrey Blainey]] and [[Keith Windschuttle]], point to introduced disease as the main cause of the destruction of the full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal population. Keith Windschuttle argues that while smallpox never reached Tasmania, respiratory diseases such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis and the effects of venereal diseases devastated the Tasmanian Aboriginal population whose long isolation from contact with the mainland compromised their resistance to introduced disease. The work of historian [[James Bonwick]] and anthropologist H. Ling Roth, both writing in the 19th century, also point to the significant role of epidemics and infertility without clear attribution of the sources of the diseases as having been introduced through contact with Europeans. Bonwick, however, did note that Tasmanian Aboriginal women were infected with venereal diseases by Europeans. Introduced venereal disease not only directly caused deaths but, more insidiously, left a significant percentage of the population unable to reproduce. Josephine Flood, archaeologist, wrote: \"Venereal disease sterilised and chest complaints \u2013 influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis \u2013 killed.\"{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=77,90,128}}{{sfn|Windschuttle|2002|pp=372\u2013376}}\n\nBonwick, who lived in Tasmania, recorded a number of reports of the devastating effect of introduced disease including one report by a Doctor Story, a [[Quaker]], who wrote: \"After 1823 the women along with the tribe seemed to have had no children; but why I do not know.\".{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|p=388}} Later historians have reported that introduced venereal disease caused infertility amongst the Aboriginal Tasmanians.{{sfn|Flood|2006|p=90}}{{sfn|Windschuttle|2002|pp=375\u2013376}} Bonwick also recorded a strong Aboriginal oral tradition of an epidemic even before formal colonisation in 1803. \"Mr Robert Clark, in a letter to me, said: 'I have gleaned from some of the aborigines, now in their graves, that they were more numerous than the white people were aware of, but their numbers were very much thinned by a sudden attack of disease which was general among the entire population previous to the arrival of the English, entire tribes of natives having been swept off in the course of one or two days' illness.'\"{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|pp=84\u201385}} Such an epidemic may be linked to contact with sailors or sealers.{{sfn|Flood|2006|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nHenry Ling Roth, an anthropologist, wrote: \"Calder, who has gone more fully into the particulars of their illnesses, writes as follows ...: 'Their rapid declension after the colony was founded is traceable, as far as our proofs allow us to judge, to the prevalence of epidemic disorders\u2026.'\"{{sfn|Roth|1899}} Roth was referring to James Erskine Calder who took up a post as a surveyor in Tasmania in 1829 and who wrote a number of scholarly papers about the Aboriginal people. \"According to Calder, a rapid and remarkable declension of the numbers of the aborigines had been going on long before the remnants were gathered together on Flinders Island. Whole tribes (some of which Robinson mentions by name as being in existence fifteen or twenty years before he went amongst them, and which probably never had a shot fired at them) had absolutely and entirely vanished. To the causes to which he attributes this strange wasting away ... I think [[infertility|infecundity]], produced by the infidelity of the women to their husbands in the early times of the colony, may be safely added ... Robinson always enumerates the sexes of the individuals he took; ... and as a general thing, found scarcely any children amongst them; ... adultness was found to outweigh infancy everywhere in a remarkable degree ...\"{{sfn|Roth|1899|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nRobinson recorded in his journals a number of comments regarding the Aboriginal Tasmanians' susceptibility to diseases, particularly respiratory diseases. In 1832 he revisited the west coast of Tasmania, far from the settled regions, and wrote: \"The numbers of aborigines along the western coast have been considerably reduced since the time of my last visit [1830]. A mortality has raged amongst them which together with the severity of the season and other causes had rendered the paucity of their number very considerable.\"{{efn|Robinson writing to Edward Curr, 22 Sept 1832. {{harv|Plomley|2008|p=732}}}}\n\nBetween 1825 and 1831 a pattern of guerilla warfare by the Aboriginal Tasmanians was identified by the colonists. Rapid pastoral expansion, a depletion of native game and an increase in the colony's population triggered Aboriginal resistance from 1824 onwards when it has been estimated by Lyndall Ryan that 1000 Aboriginal people remained in the settled districts. Whereas settlers and stock keepers had previously provided rations to the Aboriginal people during their seasonal movements across the settled districts, and recognised this practice as some form of payment for trespass and loss of traditional hunting grounds, the new settlers and stock keepers were unwilling to maintain these arrangements and the Aboriginal people began to raid settlers' huts for food.\n\nThe official Government position was that Aboriginal people were blameless for any hostilities, but when [[Musquito]] was hanged in 1825, a significant debate was generated which split the colonists along class lines. The \"higher grade\" saw the hanging as a dangerous precedent and argued that Aboriginal people were only defending their land and should not be punished for doing so. The \"lower grade\" of colonists wanted more Aboriginal people hanged to encourage a \"conciliatory line of conduct.\" Governor Arthur sided with the \"lower grade\" and 1825 saw the first official acceptance that Aboriginal people were at least partly to blame for conflict.\n\nIn 1826 the Government gazette, which had formerly reported \"retaliatory actions\" by Aboriginal people, now reported \"acts of atrocity\" and for the first time used the terminology \"Aborigine\" instead of \"native\". A newspaper reported that there were only two solutions to the problem: either they should be \"hunted down like wild beasts and destroyed\" or they should be removed from the settled districts. The colonial Government assigned troops to drive them out. A Royal Proclamation in 1828 established military posts on the boundaries and a further proclamation declared [[martial law]] against the Aboriginal people. As it was recognised that there were fixed routes for seasonal migration, Aboriginal people were required to have passes if they needed to cross the settled districts with bounties offered for the capture of those without passes, \u00a35 (around 2010:$1,000) for an adult and \u00a32 for children, a process that often led to organised hunts resulting in deaths. Every dispatch from Governor Arthur to the Secretary of State during this period stressed that in every case where Aboriginal people had been killed it was colonists that initiated hostilities.{{sfn|Cove|1995|pp=25\u201329}}\n\nThough many Aboriginal deaths went unrecorded, the [[Cape Grim massacre]] in 1828 demonstrates the level of frontier violence towards Aboriginal Tasmanians.\n\nThe [[Black War]] of 1828\u201332 and the [[Black Line]] of 1830 were turning points in the relationship with European settlers. Even though many of the Aboriginal people managed to avoid capture during these events, they were shaken by the size of the campaigns against them, and this brought them to a position whereby they were willing to surrender to Robinson and move to [[Flinders Island]].\n\n====Tasmanian aboriginals and settlers mentioned in literature 1800\u20131835====\nEuropeans killed and Aborigines captured may be considered as reasonably accurate.

It was bounded on one side by the sea, and on the other side by a saltwater lagoon bordered with thick tea-tree which cut off access to the main island. {{citation needed|date=May 2017}}}}\nSupplies to the settlement were inadequate and if sealers had not supplied potatoes, the Aboriginal people would have starved. The Europeans were living on oatmeal and potatoes while the Aboriginal people, who detested oatmeal and refused to eat it, survived on potatoes and rice supplemented by [[short-tailed shearwater|mutton birds]] they caught.{{sfn|Roth|1899|p=3}} Within months 31 Aboriginal people had died. <blockquote>They were lodged at night in shelters or \"breakwinds.\" These \"breakwinds\" were thatched roofs sloping to the ground, with an opening at the top to let out the smoke, and closed at the ends, with the exception of a doorway. They were twenty feet long by ten feet wide. In each of these from twenty to thirty blacks were lodged ... To savages accustomed to sleep naked in the open air beneath the rudest shelter, the change to close and heated dwellings tended to make them susceptible, as they had never been in their wild state, to chills from atmospheric changes, and was only too well calculated to induce those severe pulmonary diseases which were destined to prove so fatal to them. The same may be said of the use of clothes ... At the settlement they were compelled to wear clothes, which they threw off when heated or when they found them troublesome, and when wetted by rain allowed them to dry on their bodies. In the case of Tasmanians, as with other wild tribes accustomed to go naked, the use of clothes had a most mischievous effect on their health.{{sfn|Roth|1899}}</blockquote>\n[[File:Benjamin Duterrau - Mr Robinson's first interview with Timmy - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Benjamin Duterrau]], ''Mr Robinson's first interview with Timmy'', 1840]]\n\nBy January 1832 a further 44 captured Aboriginals had arrived and conflicts arose between the tribal groups. To defuse the situation, Sergeant Wight took the Big River group to [[Green Island (Tasmania)|Green island]], where they were abandoned and he later decided to move the rest to Green Island as well. Two weeks later Robinson arrived with Lieutenant Darling, the new commander for the station, and moved the Aboriginal people back to The Lagoons. Darling ensured a supply of plentiful food and permitted \"hunting excursions.\" In October 1832, it was decided to build a new camp with better buildings ([[wattle and daub]]) at a more suitable location, Pea Jacket Point. Pea Jacket Point was renamed Civilisation Point but became more commonly known as Wybalenna, which in the Ben Lomond language meant \"Blackman's Houses\".{{sfn|Roth|1899}}\n\nRobinson befriended Truganini, learned some of the local language and in 1833 managed to persuade the remaining 154 \"full-blooded\" people to move to the new settlement on Flinders Island, where he promised a modern and comfortable environment, and that they would be returned to their former homes on the Tasmanian mainland as soon as possible. At the Wybalenna Aboriginal establishment on Flinders Island, described by historian [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] as the \"best equipped and most lavishly staffed Aboriginal institution in the Australian colonies in the nineteenth century\", they were provided with housing, clothing, rations of food, the services of a doctor and educational facilities. Convicts were assigned to build housing and do most of the work at the settlement including the growing of food in the vegetable gardens.{{efn|Flood cites Henry Reynolds. {{harv|Flood|2006|p=88}}}} After arrival, all Aboriginal children aged between six and 15 years were removed from their families to be brought up by the storekeeper and a lay preacher.{{sfn|Bringing them Home \u2013 The Report}} The Aboriginal people were free to roam the island and were often absent from the settlement for extended periods on hunting trips as the rations supplied turned out to be inadequate. By 1835 the living conditions had deteriorated to the extent that in October Robinson personally took charge of Wybalenna, organising better food and improving the housing. However, of the 220 who arrived with Robinson, most died in the following 14 years from introduced disease and inadequate shelter. As a result of their loss of freedom, the birth rate was extremely low and few children survived infancy.\n[[File:oyster cove mob.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Oyster Cove Mob]]\nIn 1839, Governor Franklin appointed a board to inquire into the conditions at Wybalenna that rejected Robinson's claims regarding improved living conditions and found the settlement to be a failure. The report was never released and the government continued to promote Wybalenna as a success in the treatment of Aboriginal people.{{sfn|Howson|2004}}\nIn March 1847 six Aboriginals at Wybalenna presented a petition to [[Queen Victoria]], the first petition to a reigning monarch from any Aboriginal group in Australia, requesting that the promises made to them be honoured.{{efn|Since the 1980s this petition has been the focus of a major argument in the legal battle regarding the promises that Robinson and Governor Arthur made to the Tasmanian Aborigines. {{citation needed|date=May 2017}}}}\nIn October 1847, the 47 survivors were transferred to their final settlement at Oyster Cove station.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870b|pp=270\u2013295}} Only 44 survived the trip (11 couples, 12 single men and 10 children) and the children were immediately sent to the orphan school in Hobart.{{sfn|Bringing them Home \u2013 The Report}} Although the housing and food was better than Wybalenna, the station was a former convict station that had been abandoned earlier that year due to health issues as it was located on inadequately drained [[mudflat]]s. According to the guards, the Aboriginal people developed \"too much independence\" by trying to continue their culture which they considered \"recklessness\" and \"rank ingratitude.\" Their numbers continued to diminish, being estimated in 1859 at around a dozen and, by 1869, there was only one, who died in 1876.\n\nCommenting in 1899 on Robinson's claims of success, anthropologist [[Henry Ling Roth]] wrote:<blockquote>While Robinson and others were doing their best to make them into a civilised people, the poor blacks had given up the struggle, and were solving the difficult problem by dying. The very efforts made for their welfare only served to hasten on their inevitable doom. The white man's civilisation proved scarcely less fatal than the white man's musket.{{sfn|Roth|1899}}</blockquote>\n\n==== Anthropological interest ====\n[[File:Fanny Cochrane Smith.oga|thumb|1903 recording of a Tasmanian language]]\nThe Oyster Cove people attracted contemporaneous international scientific interest from the 1860s onwards, with many museums claiming body parts for their collections. Scientists were interested in studying Aboriginal Tasmanians from a [[physical anthropology]] perspective, hoping to gain insights into the field of [[paleoanthropology]]. For these reasons, they were interested in individual Aboriginal body parts and whole [[skeletons]].\n\nTasmanian Aboriginal [[Human skull|skulls]] were particularly sought internationally for studies into [[craniofacial anthropometry]]. Truganini herself entertained fears that her body might be exploited after her death and two years after her death her body was exhumed and sent to Melbourne for scientific study. Her skeleton was then put up for public display in the Tasmanian Museum until 1947, and was only lay to rest, by cremation, in 1976.{{sfn|Fforde|Hubert|2006|pp=79\u201380}} Another case was the removal of the skull and scrotum \u2013 for a tobacco pouch \u2013 of William Lanne, known as King Billy, on his death in 1869.\n\nHowever, many of these skeletons were obtained from \"aboriginal mummies\" from graves or bodies of the murdered. [[Amalie Dietrich]] for example became famous for delivering such specimens.{{sfn|Turnbull|1991}}\n\nAboriginal people have considered the dispersal of body parts as being disrespectful, as a common aspect within Aboriginal [[belief systems]] is that a soul can only be at rest when laid in its homeland.\n\n=== 20th century to present ===\n[[File:Fanny Cochrane Smith recording.jpg|thumb|Horace Watson recording the songs of [[Fanny Cochrane Smith]], considered to be the last fluent speaker of a Tasmanian language, 1903.

Since the mid-1970s Tasmanian Aboriginal activists such as [[Michael Mansell]] have sought to broaden awareness and identification of Aboriginal descent.\n\nA dispute exists within the Tasmanian Aboriginal community, however, over what constitutes [[Aboriginality]]. Since splitting from the [[Lia Pootah]] in 1996, the Palawa minority were given the power to decide who is of Tasmanian Aboriginal descent at the state level (entitlement to government Aboriginal services). Palawa recognise only descendants of the Bass Strait Island community as Aboriginal and do not consider as Aboriginal the Lia Pootah, who claim descent, based on oral traditions, from Tasmanian mainland Aboriginal communities. The Lia Pootah feel that the Palawa controlled [[Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre]] does not represent them politically.{{sfn|Lia Pootah Community|2008}}{{sfn|Australian Broadcasting Corporation|2002}}\nSince 2007 there have been initiatives to introduce [[DNA profiling|DNA testing]] to establish family history in descendant subgroups. This is strongly opposed by the Palawa and has drawn an angry reaction from some quarters, as some have claimed \"[[spirituality|spiritual]] connection\" with Aboriginality distinct from, but not as important as the existence of a genetic link. The Lia Pootah object to the current test used to prove Aboriginality as they believe it favours the Palawa, a [[DNA test]] would circumvent barriers to Lia Pootah recognition, or disprove their claims to Aboriginality.{{sfn|Denholm|2007}}\n\nIn April 2000, the Tasmanian Government ''Legislative Council Select Committee on Aboriginal Lands'' discussed the difficulty of determining Aboriginality based on oral traditions. An example given by Prof. [[Cassandra Pybus]] was the claim by the Huon and Channel Aboriginal people who had an oral history of descent from two Aboriginal women. Research found that both were non-Aboriginal convict women.{{sfn|Legislative Council Select Committee|2002}}\n\nThe Tasmanian Palawa Aboriginal community is making an effort to reconstruct and reintroduce a Tasmanian language, called [[palawa kani]] out of the various records on Tasmanian languages. Other Tasmanian Aboriginal communities use words from traditional Tasmanian languages, according to the language area they were born or live in.\n\n==Tasmanian Aboriginal nations==\n[[File:Tasmanian tribes.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Map of Tasmanian nations]]\nThe social organisation of Aboriginal Tasmanians had at least two hierarchies: the domestic unit or family group and the social unit or clan - which had a self-defining name with 40 to 50 people. It is contentious whether there was a larger political organisation, hitherto described as a \"tribe\" in the literature (and by colonial observers), as there is no evidence in the historical literature of larger political entities above that of the clan. Robinson, who gathered ethnographic data in the early 1800s, described aboriginal political groups at the clan level only. Nevertheless, clans that shared a geographic region and language group are now usually classified by modern ethnographers, and the Palawa, as a nation.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|pp=10\u201311}}{{sfn|Taylor|2006}}\n\nEstimates made of the combined population of the Aboriginal people of Tasmania, before European arrival in Tasmania, are in the range of 3,000 to 15,000 people.{{sfn|Madley|2008|pp=77\u2013106}} Genetic studies have suggested much higher figures which is supported by oral traditions that Aboriginal people were \"more numerous than the white people were aware of\" but that their population had been greatly reduced by a sudden outbreak of disease before 1803. It is speculated that early contacts with sealers before colonisation had resulted in an epidemic.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|pp=84\u201385}} Using archaeological evidence, Stockton (I983:68) estimated 3,000 to 6,000 for the northern half of the west coast alone, or up to six times the commonly accepted estimate, however he later revised this to 3,000 to 5,000 for the entire island, based on historical sources. The low rate of [[genetic drift]] indicates that Stockton's original maximum estimate is likely the lower boundary and, while not indicated by the archaeological record, a population as high as 100,000 can \"not be rejected out of hand\". This is supported by [[carrying capacity]] data indicating greater resource productivity in Tasmania than the mainland.{{sfn|Pardoe|1991|pp=1\u201327}}\n\nThe Aboriginal Tasmanians were primarily nomadic people who lived in adjoining territories, moving based on seasonal changes in food supplies such as seafood, land mammals and native vegetables and berries. They socialised, intermarried and fought \"wars\" against other clans.{{sfn|ABS|2008}}\n\nAccording to Ryan,{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=14}} the population of Tasmania was aligned into nine nations composed of six to fifteen clans each, with each clan comprising two to six extended family units who were relations. Individual clans ranged over a defined nation boundary with elaborate rites of entry required of visitors.{{sfn|Huys|2009|p=17}}\n\nThere were more than 60 clans before European colonisation, although only 48 have been located and associated with particular territories.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|pp=10\u201311}}\nThe location and migratory patterns discussed below come from the work of Jones (cited in Tindale). Ryan used Jones' work in her seminal history of Tasmanian Aboriginals{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}} but Taylor discusses in his thesis how Jones' original work is uncited and possibly conjectural.{{sfn|Taylor|2006}} Moreover, Jones published his work without recourse to Plomley's later extensive descriptions of Tasmanian Aboriginal clan groups. Given this, the clan boundaries and nomadic patterns discussed below should be taken with caution unless referenced from primary documents.\n\n===Oyster Bay (Paredarerme)===\nThe Paredarerme was estimated to be the largest Tasmanian nation with ten clans totalling 700 to 800 people.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=17}} The members of the Paredarerme nation had good relations with the Big River nation, with large congregations at favoured hunting sites inland and at the coast. Relations with the North Midlands nation were mostly hostile, and evidence suggests that the [[Douglas-Apsley National Park|Douglas-Apsley]] region may have been a dangerous borderland rarely visited (Ferguson 1986 pg22). Generally, the clans of the Paredarerme ranged inland to the High Country for spring and summer and returned to the coast for autumn and winter, but not all people left their territory each year with some deciding to stay by the coast. Migrations provided a varied diet with plentiful seafood, seals and birds on the coast, and good hunting for kangaroos, wallabies and possums inland.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|p=17}} The High Country also provided opportunities to trade for ochre with the North-west and North people, and to harvest intoxicating gum from ''[[Eucalyptus gunnii]]'', found only on the plateau.{{sfn|Ryan|1996|pp=10\u201311}} The key determinant of camp sites was [[topography]]. The majority of camps were along river valleys, adjacent north facing hill slopes and on gentle slopes bordering a forest or marsh (Brown 1986).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Clan\n! Territory\n!

The settlement was a failure, with the inland areas described as \"wet, cold and soggy\", while the coastal region was difficult to clear, as Superintendent Henry Hellyer noted the \"forest [was] altogether unlike anything I have seen in the Island\". However, in 1827 a port was established at Emu Bay. In 1828 Tarerenorerer (Eng:Walyer), a woman who had escaped from sealers, became the leader of the Emu Bay people and attacked the settlers with stolen weapons, the first recorded use of muskets by Aboriginal people.{{sfn|Burnie City Council}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

To the west the nation was bounded by the escarpment of the Great Western Tiers, to the north-east the boundaries are less certain; with the eastern Tamar appearing to have been occupied by the Letteremairrener as far east as Piper's River: where the Poremairrenerner clan of the North-east nation were resident.{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|pp=18\u201319}}\nThe occupation of the western Tamar is open to dispute -  the ethnographic record suggests that it was the province of the Pallitorre and Parnillerpanner clans of the North nation; or the Leterrmairrener; or a hitherto unnamed clan of the North Midlands nation.{{sfn|Kee|1990}} It is likely that the west Tamar valley, or the Meander river valley formed the NNW boundaries of the North Midlands nation - with the arc of highlands formed by Cluan Tier and Dry's Bluff forming the nor-western extremity of their country.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|pp=18\u201319}}\nTo the east the natural boundary was the South-Esk River and, running northwards, the high tier of Mts Barrow, Arthur and Tippogoree Hills: beyond which lay the North-east nation. Running south past the eastern bend of the South-Esk it appears that the North Midlands Nation held land to some extent along the south bank of the Esk, at least as far as Avoca and possibly as far as the natural boundary of the St Pauls River, beyond which the Oyster Bay nation were resident.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}\nTo the south their country was constrained by the uplands beyond Tunbridge, as the plains narrow towards Big River and Oyster Bay country.{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|pp=18\u201320}}\n\n====Language of the North Midlands nation====\nThe North Midlands language is classified as \"mairremenner\" and was spoken by the Ben Lomond and North-east nations and also the Luggermairrenerpairer clan of the Central Highlands. This language group is likely to be a derivation of three other Tasmanian languages.{{sfn|Breen|Summer|2006}}\n\n====Clans of the North Midlands nation====\nThree major national divisions are generally ascribed to the North Midlands nation although it is likely that more clans existed and Ryan (2012) asserts the possibility of another two clan territories.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}} What is known of the composition of the North Midlands nation derives from settler description (who ascribed simple tribal divisions based upon locality), direct attribution from contemporary Tasmanian Aborigines (recorded by [[George Augustus Robinson|Robinson]] collated by [[Brian Plomley|Plomley]]) and later research by [[Rhys Jones (archaeologist)|Rhys Jones]]. From this we can be certain that there were three major clan divisions, described by colonials as the Port Dalrymple Tribe (Leterrermairrener Clan), at the Tamar River; Pennyroyal Creek Tribe (Panninher), at Norfolk Plains; and the Stony Creek Tribe (Tyrrernotepanner), at Campbell Town.\n\n=====The Letteremairrener \"Port Dalrymple\" Clan=====\nThe Letteremairrener (Letter-ramare-ru-nah) Clan occupied country from Low Head to modern day Launceston. In colonial times reports were made of clusters of huts, up to ten in number, in the Tamar valley and there are extensive archeological remains of occupation on both sides of the Tamar river and north coastal country.{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}}\n\n======Toponymy======\nLittle is recorded of the toponymy of their country but some local placenames have survived and are likely to be of the \"Nara\" language group.\n* Tamar River: kunermurluker, morerutter, ponrabbel{{sfn|Plomley|1992a}}\n* Low Head: Pilerwaytackenter\n* Georgetown area: Kennemerthertackenloongentare\n* Launceston (Port Dalrymple): Taggener, Lorernulraytitteter\n* North-Esk River: Lakekeller\n* Mt Barrow: Pialermaligena\n\n======Significant sites======\nLittle is known of specific sites of significance to the Letteremairrener, but contemporary Palawa assert the significance of the [[Cataract Gorge]]{{sfn|Breen|Summer|2006}}{{sfn|Clarke|2015}}\nas a place of [[Aboriginal ceremony|ceremony]] and significance. Certainly, in 1847, when a surviving Aboriginal \"chief\" was temporarily returned to Launceston from exile in Wybalenna, he requested to be taken to the Cataract Gorge and was described as being jubilant at return to the Gorge, followed with apparent lamentation at what had been lost to him.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|p=?}}{{sfn|Richards|Johnson|2007|p=63}}\nThere are no recorded significant archeological remains in the Gorge precinct, although the area was subject to significant seasonal flooding before damming.{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}}\n\nThe Letteremairrener had been recorded to have specific meeting places at Paterson's Plains (near modern-day St Leonards){{sfn|Breen|Summer|2006}} and groups as large as 150 had been recorded in colonial times in this vicinity.{{sfn|Bonwick|1870a|p=?}} The Clan country overlapped with that of the Panninher and Tyrrernotepanner and it is likely that, at times, the clans shared resources across clan borders.{{sfn|Kee|1990|p=?}}\n\n======Colonial contact======\nThe Letteremairrener were among the first Tasmanian Aboriginals to be affected by the impact of colonisation by the British as colonial occupation commenced at Port Dalrymple and progressed to Launceston, with settlers progressively occupying land up the Tamar valley.\nBy the early 1800s the Letteremairrener had been involved in skirmishes with exploratory parties of colonials, in the second decade of that century they had reached some accommodation with the interlopers; and were observed practicing spear throwing near present-day Paterson Barracks and watching colonial women wash clothes at Cataract Gorge.{{sfn|Bethell|1957}}\nBetween 1811 and 1827 several aboginal children were baptised in Launceston, either abducted or the progeny of settler/aboriginal liaison.\nBy 1830 the people of the Letteremairenner had largely disappeared from their homeland and the survivors were waging a desperate guerrilla war with colonial British, living a fringe existence in Launceston or living life on the margin at the peripheries of their traditional land.\nBy 1837 the Letteremairrenner had disappeared completely from the Tamar Valley and would eventually die in the squalor of Wybalenna or Oyster Cove.\n\n=====The Panninher \"Pennyroyal Creek\" Clan=====\nThe Panninher (parn-in-her) were known to colonial people as the Penny Royal Creek Tribe, named eponymously from the river that comes off the Western Tiers south of Drys Bluff (which is now called the [[Liffey River, Tasmania|Liffey River]]). The Panninher named the Liffey river ''tellerpanger'' and Drys Bluff, the mountain rearing above their homeland, was ''taytitkekitheker''. Their territory broadly covered the north plains of the midlands from the west bank of the Tamar River across to what is now Evandale and terminating at the Tyerrernotepanner country around modern day Conara.{{sfn|Kee|1990}}\n\nThe Panninher also freely moved from the Tamar to the central highlands and brokered trade in ochre from the Toolumbunner mine to neighbouring clans.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}\nRobinson describes the aboriginal road used by the Panninher from their home up to the Central Highlands, via the gully of the Liffey river, and the South road along the base of the Western Tiers - up the Lake River to modern day Interlaken.\n\n======Significant sites======\nWhilst sites of ritual significance to the Panninher are not known, the Panninher were known to frequent Native Point, on the [[South Esk River]] between modern day [[Perth, Tasmania|Perth]] and [[Evandale, Tasmania|Evandale]], where flint quarries were located and clans met for celebration.{{sfn|Roth|1899}} Here local historians believe that cemetery (hollowed) trees were used to inter the dead.{{sfn|Haygarth|2013|pp=4\u20135}}\nSimilarly, Reibey's Ford, near modern-day [[Hadspen]], was a known \"resort of the natives\" and they named this site ''moorronnoe''.{{sfn|Plomley|1992a}} Archaeological evidence shows also indicates signs of continuous occupation at permanent lagoons near Cleveland,{{sfn|Kee|1990}} which was known historically as a clan meeting place.{{sfn|Kee|1990}}{{sfn|Stancombe|1968}}\n\nThe Panninher were affected early by settlement around Norfolk Plains and aggressive assertion of property rights by settlers at first hindered their hunting and migration through their country and, subsequently, led to outright hostility from both parties. Captain Ritchie, an early settler near Perth, tolerated, or fostered, forays by his assigned men against the Panninher and this culminated in a massacre by settlers near modern-day Cressy.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}\nThe Panninher, or their neighbouring clansmen, retaliated in various attacks against settlers at Western Lagoon and in remote country up the Lake River, reaching a peak in aggression against the colonial interlopers by 1827.{{sfn|Clements|2014}}\nIn 1831 a war party of \"100 or 150 stout men\" attacked settlers at the base of the Western Tiers and up the Lake River{{sfn|Clements|2014}} but it is unclear whether this was the action of the Panninher alone or a confederation of warriors from remnant North Tasmanian nations. The colonial settlers made little discrimination between Panninher and members of the \"Stony Creek Tribe\" and it is likely that the North Midlands nation had disintegrated and the amalgamated band was known under the overarching name of \"Stony Creek Tribe\" by this time. This notwithstanding, it seems that the Panninher were resourceful enough to survive in some numbers until late in the Black War.\n\n=====The Tyerrernotepanner \"Stony Creek\" clan=====\nThe Tyerrernotepanner (Chera-noti-pana) were known to colonial people as the Stony Creek Tribe, named eponymously from the small southern tributary of the South Esk at Llewellyn, west of modern-day Avoca.{{sfn|Roth|1899}}\n\nThe clan Tyerrernotepanner were centred at [[Campbell Town, Tasmania|Campbell Town]] and were one of up to four clans in the south central Midlands area.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=?}}\nNevertheless, this clan name is now used as a general term for all aboriginal peoples of this region. The ethnographic and archaeological evidence describes areas of significance to the south central Midlands clans: modern day Lake Leake, Tooms Lake, Windfalls farm, Mt Morriston, Ross township{{sfn|Casella|2002|p=30}} and the lacustrine regions of the midlands all show evidence of tool knapping, middens and records of hut construction consistent with occupation.{{sfn|Kee|1990}}{{sfn|Plomley|2008}}\n\n===== Significant sites =====\nLake Leake (previously Kearney's Bogs), Campbell Town, Ellinthorpe Plains (near modern day Auburn) and Tooms Lake were described as \"resorts of the natives\" by settlers and showed substantial evidence of seasonal occupation.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=?}} Furthermore, several small lagoons in the midlands area all show substantial archeological evidence of regular occupation consistent with tool-making and semi-nomadic use. Aboriginal roads, ''markenner'', are described as passing up the Eastern Tiers to Swanport, up the Western Tier to Interlaken and up the Lake River to Woods Lake and thence to the Central Highlands.{{sfn|Kee|1990}}\n\nThe clan divisions of the southern central Midlands are suggested below. Caution must be exercised as to the provenance of the names and the complete accuracy of attributing discrete geographical regions.\n* ''tyrrernotepanner'': clan at Northern Campbell Town/Lake river/ South Fingal Valley\n* ''marwemairer'': clan at Ross/Mt Morriston region\n* ''peenrymairmener'': clan at Glen Morriston/Lake Leake\n* ''rolemairre'': clan at Tunbridge area{{sfn|Kee|1990}}{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|pp=23, 24}}\n\nThe Tyerrernotepanner are described consistently in contemporary records as a \"fierce tribe\" and the records describe consistent and concerted violence by the Tyerrernotepanner during the Black War. The Tyeerrernotepanner, along with clansmen from other remnant tribes, conducted raids across the midlands during the Black War and, until \"conciliated\" by Robinson, were the subject of fearful reminiscence by colonial people.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}\nThe famed aboriginal leader Umarrah was a member of this clan and he was noted for his aggression and sustained campaign against European interlopers - although he was raised by colonials himself.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=?}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They occupied the 260 km2 of country surrounding the [[Ben Lomond (Tasmania)|Ben Lomond]] plateau. Three clan names are known but their locations are somewhat conjectural - the clans were recorded as Plangermaireener, Plindermairhemener and Tonenerweenerlarmenne.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=32}}{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=1005}}\n\nThe Plangermaireener clan is recorded as variously inhabiting the south-east aspect of the Ben Lomond region and also has been associated with the Oyster Bay or Cape Portland Clans to the east - indeed the chief [[Mannalargenna]] is variously described as a chief of the Oyster Bay, Cape Portland and Ben Lomond nations.{{sfn|Mannalargenna}}{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=20}}\nPlangermaireener is also used as a blanket term for the Ben Lomond nation, which reflects the suffix \"mairreener\"; meaning \"people\".{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|p=13}}\n\nThe Plindermairhemener are recorded in association with the south and south-western aspects of the region{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=1005}}{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|p=20}}{{sfn|Kee|1991|p=?}}{{sfn|Hansen|2004|p=125}} and the location of the Tonenerweenerlarmenne is uncertain, but were probably centred in the remaining Ben Lomond nation territory from White Hills to the headwaters of the North and South-Esk rivers or the upper South-Esk Valley.{{sfn|Syme|Ball|Elder|2012}}\nThis notwithstanding, the Palawa were a nomadic people and likely occupied these lands seasonally.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=32}}\n\nThe Ben Lomond nation is sometimes described as the Ben Lomond/Pennyroyal Creek nation from an entry in [[George Augustus Robinson|Robinson]]'s journal:\n'(Mannalargenna) ... said that \"the smoke...was that of the Ben Lomond-Pennyroyal Creek natives\"'{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=315}}\n\nThis is a misnomer, as the Pennyroyal Creek was the original European name for the [[Liffey River (Tasmania)|Liffey River]] and the Pennyroyal Creek Tribe was the contemporary name of the Panninher Clan of the North Midlands nation.{{sfn|Plomley|1992b|p=31}}{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=1011}}\nMannalargenna would be familiar with the clans neighbouring his own traditional country and could be relied upon to report accurately the composition of the clanspeople in question. It is plausible that when Robinson was writing in 1830 the remnant peoples of the Ben Lomond nation had federated with that of the Panninher and this was the provenance of the conjoined title.\n\n====Seasonal movement====\nThe clans of the Ben Lomond nation were nomadic and the Aborigines hunted along the valleys of the [[South Esk River|South Esk]] and [[North Esk River|North Esk]] rivers, their tributaries and the highlands to the northeast; as well as making forays to the plateau in summer. There are records of aboriginal huts or dwellings around the foothills of [[Stacks Bluff]] and around the headwaters of the South Esk River near modern-day Mathinna.{{sfn|Kee|1991|p=?}} On the plateau there is evidence of artifacts around Lake Youl that suggests regular occupation of this site by aborigines after the last ice age.{{sfn|Kee|1991|p=?}} The clans of the Ben Lomond nation had close enough relationships with neighbouring clans of the East Coast and North Midlands that they enjoyed seasonal foraging rights to these adjoining territories.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=32}} [[John Batman]] describes the seasonal movement of the Plangermaireener in his diary of May 1830:\n\n''\"...the tribe travels around Ben Lomond from South Esk to North Esk - and from thence to St. Patricks Head - Georges Bay and round the East Coast\"''{{sfn|Kee|1991|p=?}}\n\nBatman further describes the relationship between the clans of the Ben Lomond nation and the North East nation:\n\n''\"...there is (sic) two tribes... they (the 'chiefs' ) are upon friendly terms and often stop and meet and talk 10 days together...\"''{{sfn|Kee|1991|p=?}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There is eyewitness evidence that the South East nation may have consisted of up to ten clans, totalling around 500 people. However, only four groups totalling 160\u2013200 people were officially recorded as the main source by Robinson, whose journals begin in 1829. By this time, Europeans had settled in most of the South East tribe's country, with the country dispossessed and food resources depleted. Their country contained the most important [[silcrete]], [[chert]] and [[quartzite]] mines in Tasmania.{{sfn|Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Survey|2001}}\nThe South East people had a hostile relationship with the Oyster Bay people whom they frequently raided, often to kidnap women.{{sfn|Refshauge|1804}}\n[[Trugernanner|Truganini]] was a Nuenonne from [[Bruny Island]], which they called ''Lunawanna-Alonnah''. The first two European towns built on the island were named Lunawanna and Alonnah, and most of the island's landmarks are named after Nuenonne people. The island was the source of the [[sandstone]] used to build many of [[Melbourne]]'s buildings, such as the Post Office and Parliament House.<ref>''Tasmania''. Regional Guide Series.

Aboriginal culture was disrupted severely in the 19th century after dispossession of land and incarceration of Aboriginal people on Wybalenna and Oyster Cove. Much traditional knowledge has irrevocably disappeared and what remains has been nurtured over several generations starting with the aboriginal wives of sealers on the Furneaux Islands.\n\nBut, as the Aboriginal writer Greg Lehman states, \"Aboriginal culture (is not) past tense.\" Aboriginal people, in a variety of forms, continue to express their culture in unique ways - expressing themes that lament the past but also celebrate endurance and continuity of culture into the future.{{sfn|Reynolds|2006}}\n\n===Pre-colonial contact===\nContemporary accounts of the ceremonial and cultural life of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people are very limited. There were no observers trained in the social sciences after the French expeditions in the 18th century had made formal study of Tasmanian Aboriginal culture. Moreover, those who wrote most comprehensively of Aboriginal life in the 19th century did so after colonial contact, and the ensuing violence and dislocation, had irrevocably altered traditional aboriginal culture. Those that most closely observed Aboriginal cultural practices either did not write accounts of what they observed or, if they did, observed culture through the ethnocentric lens of religious and proselytising 19th century European men.\n\n==== Mythology ====\nThe mythology of the Aboriginal Tasmanians appears to be complex and possibly specific to each clan group. One of their creation myths refers to two creator deities, Moinee and Droemerdene; the children of Parnuen, the sun, and Vena, the moon.{{sfn|Haynes|2000|pp=53\u201390}}{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=436}}\n\nMoinee appears as the primeval creator, forming the land and rivers of Tasmania and fashioning the first man, Parlevar - embodied from a spirit residing in the ground. This form was similar to a [[kangaroo]], and Aboriginal people consequently take the kangaroo as a totem.{{sfn|Lehman|2006}} Similarly, Moinee then created the kangaroo, who emerged, like the first man, from the soil.\n\nDroemerdene appears as the star Canopus who helped the first men to change from their kangaroo-like form. He removed their tails and fashioned their knee joints \"so that they could rest\" and thus man achieved differentiation form the kangaroo.{{sfn|Lehman|2006}}\n\nMoinee fought with his brother Droemerdene, and many \"devils\", after Droemerdene changed the shape of the first men and Moinee was finally hurled to his death from the sky to take form as a standing stone at Cox Bight. Droemerdene subsequently fell into the sea at Louisa Bay.{{sfn|Haynes|2000|pp=53\u201390}}\nToogee Low (Port Davey) remained in mythology as a residence of many \"devils\".\n\nTasmanian Aboriginal mythology also records in their [[oral history]] that the first men emigrated by land from a far-off country and the land was subsequently flooded - an echo of the Tasmanian people's migration from mainland Australia to (then) peninsular Tasmania, and the submergence of the land bridge after the last ice age.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=514}}\n\n==== Spirituality ====\nLittle has been recorded of traditional Tasmanian Aboriginal spiritual life. Colonial British recorded that Aboriginal people describe topographical features, such as valleys and caves, as being inhabited by spiritual entities recorded by contemporaries as \"sprites\". Furthermore, Robinson recorded members of some clans as having animistic regard for certain species of tree within their domain.\nRobinson recorded several discussions regarding spiritual entities that his companions describe as having agency or a source of interpretive power to aid their navigation of their physical world. The Tasmanian Aboriginal people would describe these entities as \"devils\" and related that these spiritual beings as walking alongside aboriginal people \"carrying a torch but could not be seen\".{{sfn|Plomley|2008}}\n\nMannarlargenna, in particular, described consulting his \"devil\" which seems to be a resident personal spirituality that provided prognostic or oracular powers.\nThe \"devil\" might also be used to describe malevolent spiritual entities in the Aboriginal cosmos.\n\nAboriginal people recounted that there was a prime malevolent spirit called ''rageowrapper'', who appeared as a large black (Aboriginal?) man and is associated with the darkness. ''Rageowrapper'' might appear borne on a strong wind or be the source of severe illness{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=52}}\nthis malign spirit might be released from a sick individual by cutting the skin to \"let him out\".{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=319}}\n\nSeveral researchers assert that there was belief in a kind of manichean cosmos with a \"good\" and \"bad\" spirit - delineated by day and night - although this may reflect the cultural bias of the observers. Milligan (a contemporary at Wyballenna) described a creator spirit called ''tiggana marrabona'' - translating as \"twilight man\" but as referred to above there are a number of supernatural beings associated with creation.{{sfn|Worms|1960|pp=1\u201316}}\n\nEtymological study of Milligan's ethnographic data describes a pantheon of spiritual beings associated with environmental or supernatural phenomena:\n\n* ''nama burag''                   - or \"the ghost of the thunderstorm\"\n* ''ragi roba''                        - (see rageowrapper) the \"revered spirit\" - frequently connoted to awesome/revered/dreaded and a signifier of ghosts/phantoms of the departed when connected with signifier ''ragi''{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=7}}\n* ''laga robana''                    - \"awful spirit of the dead\" i.e. the dead man, some kind of dreaded spirit, malevolent phantom{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=8}}\n* ''maian ginja''                     - \"the killer\" - translates also to fiend/demon: bringer of death{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=9}}\n* ''muran bugana luwana''    - \"the bright spirit of the night\" - a kind of benign or ebullient entity, often described of female form \"clothed in grass\"{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=10}}\n* ''wara wana''                      - \"the spirit being\" - also ''warrawah'' translates to transcendental/ethereal/spirit of dead associated with celestial bodies- may be malevolent{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=11}}\n* ''badenala''                        - \"shadow man\" - ghost or spirit{{sfn|Worms|1960|pp=1\u201316}}\n* ''kana tana''                       - \"the bone man\" - Western Nation language term for spirit of the dead{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=14}}\n* ''nangina''                          - \"shadow/ghost\" - contemporary association with \"fairy\" or \"elf\" - a supernatural entity dwelling \"in the hill - dancing (and) fond of children\"{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=14}}\n* ''buga nubrana''                 - \"the man's eye\" - associated with the sun - possibly a benign entity{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=15}}\n\nTraditional Aboriginal Tasmanians also related beliefs of a spiritual afterlife. One such belief, related by an Aboriginal person from the west coastal nation, was that the spirit of the dead travelled to a place over the sea: to the far north-west, called ''Moo-ai''. This possibly reflects the ancestral memory of the ''Mara'' language group, resident in Western Tasmania, who are believed to have settled Tasmania from the Warrnambool region in modern day Victoria,{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=498}} but other Tasmanians state that after death their spirits would have a post-corporeal existence in their traditional lands.{{sfn|Plomley|1991}}{{sfn|Roe}}<br /> Other references are made to an Island of the Dead, ''tini drini'', described as \"an island in Bass Strait\" where the dead would be reincarnated or \"jump up white men\". White here does not refer to European, but rather the skeletal or phantasmic nature of returned dead.{{sfn|Worms|1960|p=12}}\n\n==== Funeral customs ====\nThe dead might be cremated or interred in a hollow tree or rock grave, dependent on clan custom.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=540}}\nAboriginal people were also recorded to keep bones of dead people as [[talisman]]s or amulets. The bones might be worn on a kangaroo sinew string bare around the neck or enclosed in a kangaroo skin bag.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=70}}\n\n==== Cosmology ====\nTraditional Tasmanian Aboriginals saw the night sky as residence of creator spirits (see above) and also describe constellations that represent tribal life; such as figures of fighting men and courting couples.{{sfn|Plomley|2008}}\n\n=== Material culture ===\n==== Use of fire ====\nThe Tasmanian Aboriginal people preferred to store coals in wrapped bark for the purpose of starting fires. This was likely due to the difficulty in creating fire in Tasmania's wet maritime climate. When this source of flame was extinguished they would seek to gain fire from neighbouring hearths or clans but also were likely to have created fire by friction methods{{sfn|Cotton|1887}}{{sfn|Taylor|2008b}}{{sfn|Gott|2002|pp=650\u2013656}}{{sfn|Breen|1992|pp=40\u201343}}{{sfn|Plomley|1991|p=106}} and possibly by mineral percussion.{{sfn|Volger|1973|pp=58\u201363}}{{sfn|Taylor|2008b}}{{sfn|Plomley|1991|p=106}} This practice gave rise to the myth that the native Tasmanians had \"lost\" the ability to make fire.{{sfn|Taylor|2008b|pp=1\u201326}} The Tasmanian Aboriginal people extensively employed fire for cooking, warmth, tool hardening and [[Fire-stick farming|clearing vegetation]] to encourage and control macropod herds.{{sfn|Gammage|2008|pp=241\u2013254}} This farming may have caused the [[Gymnoschoenus sphaerocephalus|buttongrass plains]] in southwest Tasmania to develop to their current extent.{{sfn|McBey|2018}}\n\n==== Hunting and diet ====\nApproximately 4,000 years ago, the Aboriginal Tasmanians largely dropped scaled fish from their diet, and began eating more land mammals, such as [[Phalangeriformes|possums]], [[kangaroos]], and [[Wallaby|wallabies]]. Aboriginal Tasmanians had employed bone tools, but it appears that they switched from worked [[bone tools]] to sharpened [[stone tools]],{{sfn|Ryan|1996}} as the effort to make bone tools began to exceed the benefit they provided.{{sfn|Manne|2003}} The significance of the disappearance of bone tools (believed to have been primarily used for fishing related activities) and fish in the diet is heavily debated. Some argue that it is evidence of a [[maladaptation|maladaptive]] society, while others argue that the change was economic, as large areas of scrub at that time were changing to grassland, providing substantially increased food resources. Fish were never a large part of the diet, ranking behind shellfish and seals, and with more resources available, the [[Labor theory of value|cost/benefit ratio]] of fishing may have become too high.{{sfn|Manne|2003}}\nArchaeological evidence indicates that around the time these changes took place, the Tasmanian people began expanding their territories, a process that was still continuing when Europeans arrived.{{sfn|Australian Bureau of Statistics|2002}}\n\n==== Basket making ====\nBasket making is a traditional craft which has been carried through into contemporary art. Baskets had many uses, including carrying food, women's and men's tools, shells, ochre, and eating utensils. Basket-like carriers were made from plant materials, kelp, or animal skin. The kelp baskets or carriers were used mainly to carry water and as drinking vessels.\n\nPlants were carefully selected to produce strong, thin, narrow strips of fibre of suitable length for basket making.\n\nSeveral different species of plant were used, including white flag iris, blue flax lily, rush and sag, some of which are still used by contemporary basket makers, and sometimes shells are added for ornamental expression.{{sfn|Tasmanian art online}}\n\n====Tasmanian Aboriginal shell necklace art====\nMaking necklaces from shells is a significant cultural tradition among Tasmanian Aboriginal women.{{sfn|National Museum of Australia}}\nNecklaces were used for adornment, as gifts and tokens of honour, and as trading objects. Dating back at least 2,600 years, necklace-making is one of the few Palawa traditions that has remained intact and has continued without interruption since before European settlement.{{sfn|National Museum of Australia}}\nA number of shell necklaces are held in the collection of the [[National Museum of Australia]].{{sfn|National Museum of Australia}}\n\n==== Ochre ====\n[[Ochre]] is an important cultural resource for the Tasmanian Aboriginal community. Traditionally, Aboriginal women had the exclusive role of obtaining ochre. Today, many Tasmanian Aboriginal men continue to respect the traditional cultural custom by obtaining ochre from women only.\n\nTasmanian ochre ranges in colour from white through yellow to red. It has many uses, including ceremonial body marking, colouring wood craft products, tie-dyeing and various other uses in crafts and arts. Tasmanian Aboriginal people consider ochre to be a special cultural resource.{{sfn|Tasmanian art online}}\n\nTraditionally, Aboriginal people have sourced ochre from sites throughout Tasmania. The most celebrated site is Toolumbunner in the Gog Range in NW Tasmania. This site lies in the traditional lands of the Pallitorre Clan and was a significant site of ochre mining, tribal meeting, celebration and trading.{{sfn|Sagona|1994}}\n\n==== Ceremony ====\nColonial settlers describe various [[Aboriginal Australian ceremonies|ceremonies enacted by Aboriginal people]]. Tasmanians would gather for ceremony that contemporaries called \"[[corroboree|corobery]]\", although that is a mainland Aboriginal word adopted by British settlers. Dance and singing was a feature of these ceremonies and dance would encompass reenactment of traditional tales and also recent events.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=706}}\nRobinson describes reenactment of a horseman hunting an Aboriginal person via the display of the \"horse-dance\" as well as the sensual \"devil-dance\" performed by women from the Furneaux islands{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=579}}\n\nBattle and funeral was also the time for painting the body with ochre or black paint. The important ceremonial meaning of painting the body can be inferred by record of discussion at the funeral for the Aboriginal man \"Robert\", in Launceston, where an Aboriginal mourner was asked by a settler why he painted his body for the funeral and he replied \"what do you wear fine clothes for?\"{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=626}}\n\n==== Visual art ====\nContemporary colonial settlers relate several examples of pictorial art drawn on the insides of huts or on remnants of discarded paper. These designs are generally circular or spiral motifs that represent celestial bodies or figures of clans-people. Robinson related that one design in an aboriginal hut was very accurately drawn and was created via the use of a kind of wooden compass.{{sfn|Plomley|2008|p=575}}\n\nThe most enduring art form left by Tasmanians are [[petroglyph]]s, or rock art. The most elaborate site is at Preminghana on the West Coast, although other significant sites exist at the Bluff in Devonport and at Greenes Creek. Smaller sites include the cupules at ''meenamatta'' Blue Tier and isolated circle motifs at Trial Harbour.{{sfn|Bednarick|2007|pp=161\u2013170}}\n\nAboriginal people inhabited Tasmania's South-west from the last glacial maximum and hand stencils and ochre smears are found in several caves, the oldest of which is dated to 10000 years ago.{{sfn|Jones|1995}}\n{{pp-semi|small=yes}}\n\n=== Modern Tasmanian Aboriginal culture ===\n==== Visual art ====\nTasmanian Aboriginal people are asserting their identity and culture through the visual arts. The art expresses the Aboriginal viewpoint on colonial history, race relations and identity. Themes consistent in modern Tasmanian Aboriginal art are loss, kinship, narratives of dispossession but also survival. The art is modern, using textiles, sculpture and photography but often incorporates ancient motifs and techniques such as shell necklaces and practical artifacts.{{sfn|Humphries|2015}}{{sfn|Gough|2012}}\n<br />\nPhotographer Ricky Maynard has had his work exhibited internationally and his documentary style \"brings to light the stories of Aboriginal people where they have previously been absent or distorted. His photographs mark historical sites, events and figures of great significance to Tasmanian and mainland Aboriginal people, and speak to their struggle in a subtle, poetic, and powerful way.\"{{sfn|Ricky Maynard}}\n<br />\nModern painting in Tasmania is starting to use techniques shared by Aboriginal art in mainland Australia but incorporating traditional Tasmanian motifs, such as spirals and celestial representation.{{sfn|Rosalind Langford - Connecting Spirits}}\nThis shows that, like mainland Australia, Aboriginal art is dynamic and evolving from established post-colonial preconceptions.\n\nTasmanian Aboriginal women have traditionally collected ''Maireener'' shells to fashion necklaces and bracelets.\nThis practice continues by Aboriginal women whose families survived on the Furneaux Islands, handed down by elder women to maintain an important link with traditional lifestyle.\nLate in the nineteenth century a number of women aimed to keep this part of their traditional culture alive in order to allow their daughters and granddaughters to participate in their cultural heritage. Today, there are only a few Tasmanian Aboriginal women who maintain this art, but they continue to hand down their knowledge and skills to younger women in their community. Shell necklace manufacture continues to maintain links with the past but is expressed as a modern art form.{{sfn|Tasmanian aboriginal art}}\n\n==== Writing ====\nThe earliest publication attributed to Tasmanian authors, predating the journalism of [[David Unaipon]] by a century, was ''The Aboriginal/Flinders Island Chronicle'', written between September 1836 and December 1837, though it is unclear to what degree its composition was influenced by \"The Commandant\", George Robinson.{{sfn|Miller|2010|p=9}}\n\nTasmanian Aboriginal authors in the past century have written history, poetry, essays and fiction. Authors such as Ida West{{sfn|West|1987}} have written autobiographies recounting their experiences growing up within white society; Phyllis Pitchford, Errol West{{efn|\"In the 1970s a young Tasmanian Aborigine, Errol West, wrote a beautiful poem, ''The Moon Birds of Big Dog Island'', about the great gaping absence that was being a Tasmanian Aborigine.\"}}{{sfn|Flanagan|2002}} and Jim Everett have written poetry, while Everett and Greg Lehman have explored their tradition as essayists.{{sfn|Thornley|2010|p=259}}{{sfn|Lehman|2006}}\n\n==Legislated definition==\nIn June 2005, the [[Tasmanian Legislative Council]] introduced an innovated definition of aboriginality into the Aboriginal Lands Act.{{sfn|Tasmanian Legislation \u2013 Aboriginal Lands Act 199}}\nThe bill was passed to allow Aboriginal Lands Council elections to commence, after uncertainty over who was \"aboriginal\", and thus eligible to vote.\n\nUnder the bill, a person can claim \"Tasmanian Aboriginality\" if they meet the following criteria:\n* Ancestry\n* Self-identification\n* Community recognition\n\n==Government compensation for \"Stolen Generations\"==\nOn 13 August 1997 a Statement of Apology (specific to removal of children) was issued \u2013 which was unanimously supported by the Tasmanian Parliament \u2013 the wording of the sentence was\n\n{{quote|That this house, on behalf of all Tasmanian(s)... expresses its deep and sincere regret at the hurt and distress caused by past policies under which Aboriginal children were removed from their families and homes; apologises to the Aboriginal people for those past actions and reaffirms its support for reconciliation between all Australians.}}\n\nThere are many people currently working in the community, academia, various levels of government and NGOs to strengthen what has been termed as the Tasmanian Aboriginal culture and the conditions of those who identify as members of the descendant community.\n\nIn November 2006 Tasmania became the first Australian state or territory to offer financial compensation for the [[Stolen Generations]], Aboriginal people forcibly removed from their families by Australian government agencies and church missions between about 1900 and 1972.

The estates passed through several hands over the next few centuries including [[Thomas Becket]] in 1162. Hemel Hempstead was in the Domesday [[Danais (hundred)|hundred of Danais]] (Daneys, i.e. Danish) which by 1200 had been combined with the hundred of Tring to form the hundred of Dacorum,<ref>http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/herts/vol2/pp141-142 British History Online: The hundred of Dacorum</ref> which maintained its court into the 19th century. In 1290 [[John of England|King John's]] grandson, the [[Earl of Cornwall]], gave the [[manorialism|manor]] to the religious order of the [[Bonhommes]] when he endowed the monastery at [[Ashridge Priory|Ashridge]]. The town remained part of the monastery's estates until the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and break-up of Ashridge in 1539. In that same year, the town was granted a [[royal charter]] by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to become a [[bailiwick]] with the right to hold a Thursday market and a fair on [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi Day]]. The first bailiff of Hemel Hempstead was William Stephyns (29 December 1539).

Wealthy landowners built a few large [[English country house|country house]]s in the locality, including [[The Bury, Hemel Hempstead|The Bury]], built in 1790, and [[Gadebridge House]], erected by the noted [[Surgery|surgeon]] and [[Anatomy|anatomist]] [[Astley Cooper|Sir Astley Cooper]] in 1811.<ref>{{cite web|title=Places:  Gadebridge House, Hemel Hempstead (Hertfordshire Genealogy)|url=http://www.hertfordshire-genealogy.co.uk/data/places/places-h/hemel-hempstead/hemel-gadebridge-house.htm|website=www.hertfordshire-genealogy.co.uk|accessdate=25 October 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025095027/http://www.hertfordshire-genealogy.co.uk/data/places/places-h/hemel-hempstead/hemel-gadebridge-house.htm|archivedate=25 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[Industrial Revolution]] gained momentum, commercial travel between the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and London increased greatly. Hemel Hempstead was located on a direct route between these areas of industry and commerce and this made it a natural waypoint for trade and travel between the two. Initially the [[Sparrows Herne Turnpike Road]] was opened in 1762. It attracted a lot of traffic that resulted in its surface wearing out quickly and it became notorious for its ruts and potholes.  .\n\nIn 1793 construction began on the [[Grand Junction Canal]], a major project to provide a freight waterway between the Midlands and the [[Port of London]]. In 1798, the canal from the Thames reached Two Waters, just south of Hemel Hempstead, and opened fully in 1805.<ref name=\"castlewharf\">{{cite web|title=The Chiltern Canal Corridor|url=http://www.castlewharf.com/drifters/image_drift/Carp_canal_walk_leaflet.pdf|publisher=astle Wharf project Berkhamsted|accessdate=1 April 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704034845/http://www.castlewharf.com/drifters/image_drift/Carp_canal_walk_leaflet.pdf|archivedate=4 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Heath Park Halt, with RCTS Rail Tour geograph-2789179-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|250px|thumb|The [[Nickey Line]] railway (closed 1949)]]\nHemel's position on the commercial transport network was established further in 1837 when the route of the new [[London and Birmingham Railway]] reached the town. The line's construction had been delayed for several years by vigorous lobbying by a number of powerful local landowners, including Sir Astley Cooper of Gadebridge House, who were all keen to protect their estates from invasion by the \"[[iron horse]]\". Their campaign was successful and the main line was routed along the [[River Bulbourne]] instead of the [[River Gade]], skirting around the edge of Hemel Hempstead. As a result, the railway station serving Hemel Hempstead was built one mile outside the town centre at [[Boxmoor]]; ''Boxmoor and Hemel Hempstead'' railway station (today's [[Hemel Hempstead railway station]]) opened in 1837.<ref name=Birtchnell>{{cite book|last=Birtchnell|first=Percy|title=A Short History of Berkhamsted|year=1960|chapter=Our Communications|isbn=9781871372007}}</ref> The railways continued to expand and in 1877 a new route opened connecting Boxmoor to the [[Midland Railway]] at {{rws|Harpenden}}.

In the last decades of that century development of houses and villas for London commuters began. Hemel steadily expanded, but only became a borough on 13 July 1898.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] ninety high explosive bombs were dropped on the town by the [[Luftwaffe]]. The most notorious incident was on 10 May 1942 when a stick of bombs demolished houses at Nash Mills killing eight people. The nearby Dickinson factories which were used to produce munitions, were the target.<ref>Yaxley, page 264</ref>\n\n===New town===\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], in 1946, the government designated Hemel Hempstead as the site of one of its proposed [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] designed to house the population displaced by the [[London Blitz]], since slums and bombsites were being cleared in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtpi.org.uk/knowledge/networks/rtpi-cih-planning-for-housing-network/new-towns-come-of-age/|title=New Towns Come of Age|website=www.rtpi.org.uk}}</ref> On 4 February 1947, the Government purchased {{convert|5910|acre|km2}} of land and began work on the \"New Town\". The first new residents moved in during April 1949, and the town continued its planned expansion through to the end of the 1980s. Hemel grew to its present population of 80,000, with new developments enveloping the original town on all sides. The original part of Hemel is still known as the \"Old Town\".\n\n[[File:Hemel Marlowes 2006.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Marlowes shopping centre and pedestrianised high street]]\n\nHemel Hempstead was announced as candidate No 3 for a New Town in July 1946, in accordance with the government's \"policy for the decentralisation of persons and industry from London\". Initially there was much resistance and hostility to the plan from locals, especially when it was revealed that any development would be carried out not by the local council but by a newly appointed government body, the Hemel Hempstead Development Corporation (later amalgamated with similar bodies to form the [[Commission for New Towns]]). However, following a public inquiry the following year, the town got the go-ahead. Hemel officially became a New Town on 4 February 1947.\n\nThe initial plans for the New Town were drawn up by architect [[Geoffrey Jellicoe]]. His view of Hemel Hempstead, he said, was \"not a city in a garden, but a city in a park.\" However, the plans were not well received by most locals. Revised, and less radical plans were drawn up, and the first developments proceeded despite local protests in July 1948. The first area to be developed was Adeyfield. At this time the plans for a revolutionary double [[roundabout]] at Moor End were first put forward, but in fact it was not until 1973 that the roundabout was opened as it was originally designed. (It was quickly christened 'The [[Magic Roundabout (Hemel Hempstead)|Magic Roundabout]]' by locals, echoing the name of the children's TV show.) The first houses erected as part of the New Town plan were in Longlands, Adeyfield, and went up in the spring of 1949. The first new residents moved in early 1950.\n\nAt this time, work started on building new factories and industrial areas, to avoid the town becoming a dormitory town. The first factory was erected in 1950 in Maylands Avenue. As building progressed with continuing local opposition, the town was becoming increasingly popular with those moving in from areas of north London. By the end of 1951, there was a waiting list of about 10,000 wishing to move to Hemel. The neighbourhoods of Bennett's End, Chaulden and Warner's End were started. [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] paid a visit shortly after her accession in 1952, and laid a foundation stone for a new church in Adeyfield \u2013 one of her first public engagements as Queen. The shopping square she visited is named Queen's Square, and the nearby area has street names commemorating the then-recent conquest of [[Timeline of climbing Mount Everest|Everest]], such as Hillary and Tenzing Roads. This conquest is also celebrated in the name of a pub in Warners End \u2013 the 'Top of the World'.\n\n[[File:Riverside, Hemel Hempstead.jpg|thumb|250px|Riverside, extension to the Marlowes shopping precinct opened 2005]]\n\nThe redevelopment of the town centre was started in 1952, with a new centre based on Marlowes south of the old town. This was alongside a green area called the Water Gardens, designed by Jellicoe, formed by ponding back the [[River Gade]]. The old centre of the High Street was to remain largely undeveloped, though the market square closed and was replaced by a much larger one in the new centre. The former private estate of Gadebridge was opened up as a public park. New schools and roads were built to serve the expanding new neighbourhoods. New housing technology such as prefabrication started to be used from the mid-'50s, and house building rates increased dramatically. Highfield was the next neighbourhood to be constructed. The [[M1 motorway]] opened to the east in 1959, and a new road connecting it to the town was opened.\n\nBy 1962, the redevelopment of the new town as originally envisaged was largely complete, though further expansion plans were then put forward. The nearby [[United States Air Force]] base of [[RAF Bovingdon|Bovingdon]], which had served as the town's 'de facto' airport, reverted to RAF use at this time, continuing as an active military airfield until 1971. A campus of [[West Herts College]], the library, new police station and the Pavilion (theatre and music venue) were all built during the 1960s. The town seemed to attract its fair share of celebrity openings, with shops and businesses opened by [[Frankie Vaughan]], [[Benny Hill]], [[Terry-Thomas]], and the new cinema was opened by Hollywood star [[Lauren Bacall]]. The last of the originally-planned neighbourhoods, Grovehill, began construction in 1967. However, further neighbourhoods of Woodhall Farm and [[Fields End]] were later built as part of the extended plans.\n\nLike other first generation new towns, Hemel is divided into residential neighbourhoods, each with their own \"village centre\" with shops, pubs and services. Each neighbourhood is designed around a few major feeder roads with many smaller [[cul-de-sac]]s and crescents, intended to minimise traffic and noise nuisance. In keeping with the optimism of the early post-war years, much of the town features [[modernism|modernist]] architecture with many unusual and experimental designs for [[house|housing]]. Not all of these have stood the test of time.  A significant issue was how to choose names for all the new roads. Many areas of the new town used themes e.g. fields, birds, rivers, poets, explorers, leaders, etc.\n\nIn 1974, the government abolished the Borough of Hemel Hempstead and the town was incorporated into Dacorum District, along with [[Tring]] and [[Berkhamsted]]. The first chairman of that council was chairman John Johnson (1913\u20131977). In the 1980s, Dacorum District Council successfully lobbied to be recognised as the successor for the Royal Charter establishing the Borough of Hemel Hempstead and thus regained the Mayor and its Aldermen and became Dacorum Borough.\n\nAt the 2001 [[United Kingdom Census 2001|census]], Hemel Hempstead was the most populated urban area in [[Hertfordshire]], narrowly more populated than its traditionally \"larger\" rival, [[Watford]].\n\n==Geography==\n{{Geographic location\n|title     = Neighbouring areas\n|Northwest = [[Leighton Buzzard]]\n|North     = [[Luton]]\n|Northeast = [[Harpenden]]\n|West      = [[Berkhamsted]]\n|Centre    = Hemel Hempstead\n|East      = [[St Albans]]\n|Southwest = [[Chesham]]\n|South     = [[Watford]]\n|Southeast = [[Radlett]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Aerial view of Hemel Hempstead 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|Aerial view of Hemel Hempstead]]\nHemel Hempstead grew up in a shallow [[chalk]]land valley at the [[confluence]] of the rivers [[River Gade|Gade]] and [[River Bulbourne|Bulbourne]], {{convert|27|mi|km}} northwest of central London.

In later 19th and early 20th centuries, Hemel was also a noted [[watercress]] growing area, supplying 1/16 of the country's national demand \u2013 following development of the New Town, the watercress growing moved to nearby [[Berkhamsted]] and [[Tring]]. The cress beds were redeveloped as the modern-day Water Gardens.\n\nJoseph Cranstone's engineering company was founded in 1798, and was responsible for much of the early street lighting in the town as well as it first [[gasworks]]. It became the Hemel Hempstead Engineering Company and stayed in business until the [[Second World War]]. In 1867 Cranstone's son built a steam powered coach which he drove to London, but which was destroyed in a crash on the return journey. A local [[Boxmoor]] pub commemorates the event.\n[[File:KD-Tower-Plough-Magic-Roundabout Hemel-Hempstead.jpg|thumb|The converted [[Kodak]] building - now known as the KD Tower - viewed from the Magic Roundabout]]\nIn 1803 the first automatic [[papermaking]] machinery was developed in Hemel by the Fourdrinier brothers at Frogmore. Paper making expanded in the vicinity in the early 19th century and grew into the huge [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson]] mills in the 20th.\n\nA traditional employer in the area was also [[Brocks Fireworks|Brock's]], manufacturer of [[firework]]s. The factory was a significant employer since well before the Second World War, and remained in production until the mid-1970s. The present-day neighbourhood of Woodhall Farm was subsequently built on the site.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1983, it was home to one of the most remarkable newspaper experiments of recent times, when the Thomson Organisation launched the [[Hemel Hempstead Evening Post-Echo]]. This comprised two evening papers \u2013 the ''Evening Echo'' and the ''Evening Post'' \u2013 and was based at a modern headquarters in Mark Road which had previously been used as a [[hot water bottle]] factory. The dual operation was conceived by Lord Thomson of Fleet to take on the Northcliffe and Beaverbrook domination of the London evening paper market and tap into what he saw as a major source of consumer advertising.\n\nThe papers were remarkable not only for technological innovation but also journalistic excellence. Both the ''Evening Echo'' and ''Evening Post'' won design awards during the late 1960s and early 1970s, but it was the ''Evening Echo'' that took the major writing honours, with John Marquis being voted Provincial Journalist of the Year in 1974 and [[Melanie Phillips]] being named Young Journalist of the Year in 1975.\n\nMany outstanding journalists worked on both papers during their heyday, with several going on to be editors and leading Fleet Street figures. Unfortunately, the operation fell victim to the freesheet revolution of the 1980s, the titles closing in 1983 with the loss of 470 jobs.\n\nSignificant historic local firms include:\n\n* [[Addressograph]], address labels and labelling systems\n* [[Apple Computer]]'s UK operations were originally based in Hemel, though they moved to much larger premises in [[Uxbridge]] during the late 1980s.\n* [[British Petroleum]].\n* [[Brocks Fireworks]], firework manufacturer\n* [[Crosfield Electronics]] \u2013 digital imaging systems, now part of FFEI Ltd.{{Update after|2012|5|22}}\n* [[Hemel Hempstead Evening Post-Echo]], then part of Thomson Regional Newspapers and one of the few nightly regional newspapers\n* [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson]] and Sons, [[Paper#Manufacturing|paper manufacturing]]\n* [[Kodak]].\n* [[Lucas Industries plc#Rotax|Lucas Aerospace]] \u2013 moved (as TRW Aeronautical Systems) to [[Pitstone]] in 2002.\n* [[Parker Hannifin Corporation]]\n\n[http://www.caremark.co.uk/locations/dacorum-and-st-albans Caremark ( Dacorum & St Albans)]\n\n===Present day===\n[[File:Hemel Hempstead, Phoenix Gateway sculpture.jpg|thumb|250px|Phoenix Gateway sculpture at the entrance to Maylands Business Park commemorates the [[Buncefield fire]].]]\n\nHemel Hempstead has a mixture of heavy and light engineering companies and has attracted a significant number of information technology and [[telecommunications]] sector companies helped by its proximity to London and the UK motorway network.

When the new town was constructed, this part of the railway was no longer in use and the [[viaduct]] demolished. The Nickey Line is now used for walking. The office building, occupied by [[BP]], was designed to create a similar skyline and effect as the viaduct. In the early 1980s it was discovered that the building was subsiding dangerously and it was vacated and demolished. Adjacent to BP buildings was a unique double-helix public car park. The lower end of Marlowes was redeveloped into the Riverside shopping complex, which opened on 27 October 2005. Retailers taking residence at the Riverside complex, include [[Debenhams]] and H&M (previously HMV).\n\nA few metres away, overlooking the 'Magic Roundabout', is Hemel's tallest building; the 20-storey [[Kodak]] building, consisting of 18 office floors, two plantroom floors and a basement. It also had an annex building two storeys high, containing a restaurant, cinema and a gym. Built as the Kodak Company's UK HQ, the tower was vacated in 2005. It was then temporarily reoccupied in 2006 after the Buncefield explosion destroyed Kodak's other Hemel offices.

The estates passed through several hands over the next few centuries including [[Thomas Becket]] in 1162. Hemel Hempstead was in the Domesday [[Danais (hundred)|hundred of Danais]] (Daneys, i.e. Danish) which by 1200 had been combined with the hundred of Tring to form the hundred of Dacorum,<ref>http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/herts/vol2/pp141-142 British History Online: The hundred of Dacorum</ref> which maintained its court into the 19th century. In 1290 [[John of England|King John's]] grandson, the [[Earl of Cornwall]], gave the [[manorialism|manor]] to the religious order of the [[Bonhommes]] when he endowed the monastery at [[Ashridge Priory|Ashridge]]. The town remained part of the monastery's estates until the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and break-up of Ashridge in 1539. In that same year, the town was granted a [[royal charter]] by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] to become a [[bailiwick]] with the right to hold a Thursday market and a fair on [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi Day]]. The first bailiff of Hemel Hempstead was William Stephyns (29 December 1539).

Hemel Hempstead was located on a direct route between these areas of industry and commerce and this made it a natural waypoint for trade and travel between the two. Initially the [[Sparrows Herne Turnpike Road]] was opened in 1762. It attracted a lot of traffic that resulted in its surface wearing out quickly and it became notorious for its ruts and potholes.  .\n\nIn 1793 construction began on the [[Grand Junction Canal]], a major project to provide a freight waterway between the Midlands and the [[Port of London]]. In 1798, the canal from the Thames reached Two Waters, just south of Hemel Hempstead, and opened fully in 1805.<ref name=\"castlewharf\">{{cite web|title=The Chiltern Canal Corridor|url=http://www.castlewharf.com/drifters/image_drift/Carp_canal_walk_leaflet.pdf|publisher=astle Wharf project Berkhamsted|accessdate=1 April 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704034845/http://www.castlewharf.com/drifters/image_drift/Carp_canal_walk_leaflet.pdf|archivedate=4 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Heath Park Halt, with RCTS Rail Tour geograph-2789179-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|250px|thumb|The [[Nickey Line]] railway (closed 1949)]]\nHemel's position on the commercial transport network was established further in 1837 when the route of the new [[London and Birmingham Railway]] reached the town. The line's construction had been delayed for several years by vigorous lobbying by a number of powerful local landowners, including Sir Astley Cooper of Gadebridge House, who were all keen to protect their estates from invasion by the \"[[iron horse]]\". Their campaign was successful and the main line was routed along the [[River Bulbourne]] instead of the [[River Gade]], skirting around the edge of Hemel Hempstead. As a result, the railway station serving Hemel Hempstead was built one mile outside the town centre at [[Boxmoor]]; ''Boxmoor and Hemel Hempstead'' railway station (today's [[Hemel Hempstead railway station]]) opened in 1837.<ref name=Birtchnell>{{cite book|last=Birtchnell|first=Percy|title=A Short History of Berkhamsted|year=1960|chapter=Our Communications|isbn=9781871372007}}</ref> The railways continued to expand and in 1877 a new route opened connecting Boxmoor to the [[Midland Railway]] at {{rws|Harpenden}}. The Harpenden to Hemel Hempstead branch railway \u2014 affectionately known as the ''[[Nickey Line]]'' \u2014 crossed the town centre on a long, curved [[Railway viaduct|viaduct]], eventually serving three local stations in the town at {{rws|Heath Park Halt}},  {{rws|Hemel Hempsted (Midland)}} and  Godwin's Halt.<ref name=\"woodward\">{{cite book|last1=Woodward|first1=Sue & Geoff|title=The Harpenden to Hemel Hempstead Railway : the Nickey Line|date=1996|publisher=Oakwood Press|location=Headington, Oxford|isbn=0-85361-502-0}}</ref>\n\nDespite the incursion of various forms of transport, Hemel remained principally an agricultural market town throughout the 19th century. In the last decades of that century development of houses and villas for London commuters began. Hemel steadily expanded, but only became a borough on 13 July 1898.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] ninety high explosive bombs were dropped on the town by the [[Luftwaffe]]. The most notorious incident was on 10 May 1942 when a stick of bombs demolished houses at Nash Mills killing eight people. The nearby Dickinson factories which were used to produce munitions, were the target.<ref>Yaxley, page 264</ref>\n\n===New town===\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], in 1946, the government designated Hemel Hempstead as the site of one of its proposed [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] designed to house the population displaced by the [[London Blitz]], since slums and bombsites were being cleared in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtpi.org.uk/knowledge/networks/rtpi-cih-planning-for-housing-network/new-towns-come-of-age/|title=New Towns Come of Age|website=www.rtpi.org.uk}}</ref> On 4 February 1947, the Government purchased {{convert|5910|acre|km2}} of land and began work on the \"New Town\". The first new residents moved in during April 1949, and the town continued its planned expansion through to the end of the 1980s. Hemel grew to its present population of 80,000, with new developments enveloping the original town on all sides. The original part of Hemel is still known as the \"Old Town\".\n\n[[File:Hemel Marlowes 2006.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Marlowes shopping centre and pedestrianised high street]]\n\nHemel Hempstead was announced as candidate No 3 for a New Town in July 1946, in accordance with the government's \"policy for the decentralisation of persons and industry from London\". Initially there was much resistance and hostility to the plan from locals, especially when it was revealed that any development would be carried out not by the local council but by a newly appointed government body, the Hemel Hempstead Development Corporation (later amalgamated with similar bodies to form the [[Commission for New Towns]]). However, following a public inquiry the following year, the town got the go-ahead. Hemel officially became a New Town on 4 February 1947.\n\nThe initial plans for the New Town were drawn up by architect [[Geoffrey Jellicoe]]. His view of Hemel Hempstead, he said, was \"not a city in a garden, but a city in a park.\" However, the plans were not well received by most locals. Revised, and less radical plans were drawn up, and the first developments proceeded despite local protests in July 1948. The first area to be developed was Adeyfield. At this time the plans for a revolutionary double [[roundabout]] at Moor End were first put forward, but in fact it was not until 1973 that the roundabout was opened as it was originally designed. (It was quickly christened 'The [[Magic Roundabout (Hemel Hempstead)|Magic Roundabout]]' by locals, echoing the name of the children's TV show.) The first houses erected as part of the New Town plan were in Longlands, Adeyfield, and went up in the spring of 1949. The first new residents moved in early 1950.\n\nAt this time, work started on building new factories and industrial areas, to avoid the town becoming a dormitory town. The first factory was erected in 1950 in Maylands Avenue. As building progressed with continuing local opposition, the town was becoming increasingly popular with those moving in from areas of north London. By the end of 1951, there was a waiting list of about 10,000 wishing to move to Hemel. The neighbourhoods of Bennett's End, Chaulden and Warner's End were started. [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] paid a visit shortly after her accession in 1952, and laid a foundation stone for a new church in Adeyfield \u2013 one of her first public engagements as Queen. The shopping square she visited is named Queen's Square, and the nearby area has street names commemorating the then-recent conquest of [[Timeline of climbing Mount Everest|Everest]], such as Hillary and Tenzing Roads. This conquest is also celebrated in the name of a pub in Warners End \u2013 the 'Top of the World'.\n\n[[File:Riverside, Hemel Hempstead.jpg|thumb|250px|Riverside, extension to the Marlowes shopping precinct opened 2005]]\n\nThe redevelopment of the town centre was started in 1952, with a new centre based on Marlowes south of the old town. This was alongside a green area called the Water Gardens, designed by Jellicoe, formed by ponding back the [[River Gade]]. The old centre of the High Street was to remain largely undeveloped, though the market square closed and was replaced by a much larger one in the new centre. The former private estate of Gadebridge was opened up as a public park. New schools and roads were built to serve the expanding new neighbourhoods. New housing technology such as prefabrication started to be used from the mid-'50s, and house building rates increased dramatically. Highfield was the next neighbourhood to be constructed. The [[M1 motorway]] opened to the east in 1959, and a new road connecting it to the town was opened.\n\nBy 1962, the redevelopment of the new town as originally envisaged was largely complete, though further expansion plans were then put forward. The nearby [[United States Air Force]] base of [[RAF Bovingdon|Bovingdon]], which had served as the town's 'de facto' airport, reverted to RAF use at this time, continuing as an active military airfield until 1971. A campus of [[West Herts College]], the library, new police station and the Pavilion (theatre and music venue) were all built during the 1960s. The town seemed to attract its fair share of celebrity openings, with shops and businesses opened by [[Frankie Vaughan]], [[Benny Hill]], [[Terry-Thomas]], and the new cinema was opened by Hollywood star [[Lauren Bacall]]. The last of the originally-planned neighbourhoods, Grovehill, began construction in 1967. However, further neighbourhoods of Woodhall Farm and [[Fields End]] were later built as part of the extended plans.\n\nLike other first generation new towns, Hemel is divided into residential neighbourhoods, each with their own \"village centre\" with shops, pubs and services. Each neighbourhood is designed around a few major feeder roads with many smaller [[cul-de-sac]]s and crescents, intended to minimise traffic and noise nuisance. In keeping with the optimism of the early post-war years, much of the town features [[modernism|modernist]] architecture with many unusual and experimental designs for [[house|housing]]. Not all of these have stood the test of time.  A significant issue was how to choose names for all the new roads. Many areas of the new town used themes e.g. fields, birds, rivers, poets, explorers, leaders, etc.\n\nIn 1974, the government abolished the Borough of Hemel Hempstead and the town was incorporated into Dacorum District, along with [[Tring]] and [[Berkhamsted]]. The first chairman of that council was chairman John Johnson (1913\u20131977). In the 1980s, Dacorum District Council successfully lobbied to be recognised as the successor for the Royal Charter establishing the Borough of Hemel Hempstead and thus regained the Mayor and its Aldermen and became Dacorum Borough.\n\nAt the 2001 [[United Kingdom Census 2001|census]], Hemel Hempstead was the most populated urban area in [[Hertfordshire]], narrowly more populated than its traditionally \"larger\" rival, [[Watford]].\n\n==Geography==\n{{Geographic location\n|title     = Neighbouring areas\n|Northwest = [[Leighton Buzzard]]\n|North     = [[Luton]]\n|Northeast = [[Harpenden]]\n|West      = [[Berkhamsted]]\n|Centre    = Hemel Hempstead\n|East      = [[St Albans]]\n|Southwest = [[Chesham]]\n|South     = [[Watford]]\n|Southeast = [[Radlett]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Aerial view of Hemel Hempstead 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|Aerial view of Hemel Hempstead]]\nHemel Hempstead grew up in a shallow [[chalk]]land valley at the [[confluence]] of the rivers [[River Gade|Gade]] and [[River Bulbourne|Bulbourne]], {{convert|27|mi|km}} northwest of central London.

A further office block was also built. Some buildings have been retained for their historic interest and to provide a home for the Apsley Paper Museum.\n\nThe now disused mill site at Nash Mills was also  redeveloped to build housing and community facilities, it retains some historic buildings .\n\n=== Marlowes and the Old Town ===\nAn indoor shopping mall was developed adjacent to the south end of the Marlowe's retail area in 1990, and in 2005 the Riverside development designed by Bernard Engle Architects was opened, effectively extending the main shopping precinct towards the Plough Roundabout. The new centre includes several outlets for national retailers including [[Debenhams]], [[Starbucks]], [[Waterstones]] and others. These two developments have moved the \u2019centre of gravity\u2019 of the retail centre away from the north end of Marlowe's has become an area for secondary outlets. Further extensive redevelopment of the northern end of Marlowes was also given the green light in 2007 and has now been completed.\n\nIn late 2014,  the council began to improve the original newtown centre's appearance. The Old Town was refurbished with new paving, signage, and landscaping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dacorum.gov.uk/home%5Cregeneration/hemel-evolution/old-town|title=Old Town Hemel Hempstead|work=dacorum.gov.uk}}</ref> The old council buildings and library have closed down,  replaced with a new development named \"The Forum\" which opened in early 2017, where Dacorum Borough Council, the new library, Hertfordshire Police's Safer Neighbourhood Team, the Hertfordshire Registration and Citizenship Service, Dacorum Community Trust, Mediation Dacorum, Relate and the Citizen's Advice Bureau are all located . 200 new homes will surround this new development.

The agricultural journalist [[William Cobbett]] noted of Hemel Hempstead in 1822 that ''\"..the land along here is very fine: a red tenacious flinty loam upon a bed of chalk at a yard or two beneath, which, in my opinion, is the very best corn land that we have in England.\"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/text/chap_page.jsp?t_id=Cobbett&c_id=8&p_id=573#pn_8|title=Vision of Britain - William Cobbett - June 19th to 24th, 1822: Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire|publisher=}}</ref> By the 18th century the grain market in Hemel was one of the largest in the country.

In later 19th and early 20th centuries, Hemel was also a noted [[watercress]] growing area, supplying 1/16 of the country's national demand \u2013 following development of the New Town, the watercress growing moved to nearby [[Berkhamsted]] and [[Tring]]. The cress beds were redeveloped as the modern-day Water Gardens.\n\nJoseph Cranstone's engineering company was founded in 1798, and was responsible for much of the early street lighting in the town as well as it first [[gasworks]]. It became the Hemel Hempstead Engineering Company and stayed in business until the [[Second World War]]. In 1867 Cranstone's son built a steam powered coach which he drove to London, but which was destroyed in a crash on the return journey. A local [[Boxmoor]] pub commemorates the event.\n[[File:KD-Tower-Plough-Magic-Roundabout Hemel-Hempstead.jpg|thumb|The converted [[Kodak]] building - now known as the KD Tower - viewed from the Magic Roundabout]]\nIn 1803 the first automatic [[papermaking]] machinery was developed in Hemel by the Fourdrinier brothers at Frogmore. Paper making expanded in the vicinity in the early 19th century and grew into the huge [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson]] mills in the 20th.\n\nA traditional employer in the area was also [[Brocks Fireworks|Brock's]], manufacturer of [[firework]]s. The factory was a significant employer since well before the Second World War, and remained in production until the mid-1970s. The present-day neighbourhood of Woodhall Farm was subsequently built on the site.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1983, it was home to one of the most remarkable newspaper experiments of recent times, when the Thomson Organisation launched the [[Hemel Hempstead Evening Post-Echo]]. This comprised two evening papers \u2013 the ''Evening Echo'' and the ''Evening Post'' \u2013 and was based at a modern headquarters in Mark Road which had previously been used as a [[hot water bottle]] factory. The dual operation was conceived by Lord Thomson of Fleet to take on the Northcliffe and Beaverbrook domination of the London evening paper market and tap into what he saw as a major source of consumer advertising.\n\nThe papers were remarkable not only for technological innovation but also journalistic excellence. Both the ''Evening Echo'' and ''Evening Post'' won design awards during the late 1960s and early 1970s, but it was the ''Evening Echo'' that took the major writing honours, with John Marquis being voted Provincial Journalist of the Year in 1974 and [[Melanie Phillips]] being named Young Journalist of the Year in 1975.\n\nMany outstanding journalists worked on both papers during their heyday, with several going on to be editors and leading Fleet Street figures. Unfortunately, the operation fell victim to the freesheet revolution of the 1980s, the titles closing in 1983 with the loss of 470 jobs.\n\nSignificant historic local firms include:\n\n* [[Addressograph]], address labels and labelling systems\n* [[Apple Computer]]'s UK operations were originally based in Hemel, though they moved to much larger premises in [[Uxbridge]] during the late 1980s.\n* [[British Petroleum]].\n* [[Brocks Fireworks]], firework manufacturer\n* [[Crosfield Electronics]] \u2013 digital imaging systems, now part of FFEI Ltd.{{Update after|2012|5|22}}\n* [[Hemel Hempstead Evening Post-Echo]], then part of Thomson Regional Newspapers and one of the few nightly regional newspapers\n* [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson]] and Sons, [[Paper#Manufacturing|paper manufacturing]]\n* [[Kodak]].\n* [[Lucas Industries plc#Rotax|Lucas Aerospace]] \u2013 moved (as TRW Aeronautical Systems) to [[Pitstone]] in 2002.\n* [[Parker Hannifin Corporation]]\n\n[http://www.caremark.co.uk/locations/dacorum-and-st-albans Caremark ( Dacorum & St Albans)]\n\n===Present day===\n[[File:Hemel Hempstead, Phoenix Gateway sculpture.jpg|thumb|250px|Phoenix Gateway sculpture at the entrance to Maylands Business Park commemorates the [[Buncefield fire]].]]\n\nHemel Hempstead has a mixture of heavy and light engineering companies and has attracted a significant number of information technology and [[telecommunications]] sector companies helped by its proximity to London and the UK motorway network.

When the new town was constructed, this part of the railway was no longer in use and the [[viaduct]] demolished. The Nickey Line is now used for walking. The office building, occupied by [[BP]], was designed to create a similar skyline and effect as the viaduct. In the early 1980s it was discovered that the building was subsiding dangerously and it was vacated and demolished. Adjacent to BP buildings was a unique double-helix public car park. The lower end of Marlowes was redeveloped into the Riverside shopping complex, which opened on 27 October 2005.

{"title_page": "Routing", "text_new": "{{about|routing in [[packet switching]] networks}}\n\n{{Use American English|date=December 2019}}\n\n'''Routing''' is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a [[Network theory|network]] or between or across multiple networks. Broadly, routing is performed in many types of networks, including [[circuit switching|circuit-switched network]]s, such as the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN), and [[computer network]]s, such as the [[Internet]].\n\nIn packet switching networks, routing is the higher-level decision making that directs [[network packet]]s from their source toward their destination through intermediate [[Node (networking)|network nodes]] by specific packet forwarding mechanisms. [[Packet forwarding]] is the transit of network packets from one [[network interface]] to another.  Intermediate nodes are typically [[network hardware]] devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], or [[network switch|switches]]. General-purpose [[computer]]s also forward packets and perform routing, although they have no specially optimized hardware for the task.\n\nThe routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of [[routing table]]s. Routing tables maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Routing tables may be specified by an administrator, learned by observing network traffic or built with the assistance of [[routing protocol]]s.\n\nRouting, in a narrower sense of the term, often refers to [[IP routing]] and is contrasted with [[bridging (networking)|bridging]]. IP routing assumes that [[network address]]es are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices.  In large networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within [[local area network]]s.\n\n==Delivery schemes==\n{{routing scheme}}<!--{{routing scheme}} links to this section-->\nRouting schemes differ in how they deliver messages:\n*[[Unicast]] delivers a message to a single specific node using a ''one-to-one'' association between a sender and destination: each destination address uniquely identifies a single receiver endpoint.\n*[[Broadcasting (networking)|Broadcast]] delivers a message to all nodes in the network using a ''one-to-all'' association; a single datagram from one sender is routed to all of the possibly multiple endpoints associated with the broadcast address. The network automatically replicates datagrams as needed to reach all the recipients within the scope of the broadcast, which is generally an entire network subnet.\n*[[Multicast]] delivers a message to a group of nodes that have expressed interest in receiving the message using a ''one-to-many-of-many'' or ''many-to-many-of-many'' association; datagrams are routed simultaneously in a single transmission to many recipients. Multicast differs from broadcast in that the destination address designates a subset, not necessarily all, of the accessible nodes.\n*[[Anycast]] delivers a message to any one out of a group of nodes, typically the one nearest to the source using a ''one-to-one-of-many'' association where datagrams are routed to any single member of a group of potential receivers that are all identified by the same destination address.  The routing algorithm selects the single receiver from the group based on which is the nearest according to some distance measure.\n*[[Geocast]] delivers a message to a group of nodes in a network based on their [[geographic location]]. It is a specialized form of multicast addressing used by some routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks.\n\nUnicast is the dominant form of message delivery on the Internet.  This article focuses on unicast routing algorithms.\n\n==Topology distribution==\nWith [[static routing]], small networks may use manually configured routing tables. Larger networks have complex [[network topology|topologies]] that can change rapidly, making the manual construction of routing tables unfeasible. Nevertheless, most of the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) uses pre-computed routing tables, with fallback routes if the most direct route becomes blocked (see [[routing in the PSTN]]).\n\n[[Dynamic routing]] attempts to solve this problem by constructing routing tables automatically, based on information carried by [[routing protocol]]s, allowing the network to act nearly autonomously in avoiding network failures and blockages. Dynamic routing dominates the Internet. Examples of dynamic-routing protocols and algorithms include [[Routing Information Protocol]] (RIP), [[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF) and [[Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol]] (EIGRP).\n\n===Distance vector algorithms===\n{{main|Distance-vector routing protocol}}\nDistance vector algorithms use the [[Bellman\u2013Ford algorithm]]. This approach assigns a ''cost'' number to each of the links between each node in the network. Nodes send information from point A to point B via the path that results in the lowest ''total cost'' (i.e. the sum of the costs of the links between the nodes used).\n\nWhen a node first starts, it only knows of its immediate neighbors and the direct cost involved in reaching them. (This information \u2014 the list of destinations, the total cost to each, and the ''next hop'' to send data to get there \u2014 makes up the routing table, or ''distance table''.) Each node, on a regular basis, sends to each neighbor node its own current assessment of the total cost to get to all the destinations it knows of. The neighboring nodes examine this information and compare it to what they already know; anything that represents an improvement on what they already have, they insert in their own table. Over time, all the nodes in the network discover the best next hop and total cost for all destinations.\n\nWhen a network node goes down, any nodes that used it as their next hop discard the entry and convey the updated routing information to all adjacent nodes, which in turn repeat the process. Eventually, all the nodes in the network receive the updates and discover new paths to all the destinations that don't involve the down node.\n\n===Link-state algorithms===\n{{main|Link-state routing protocol}}\nWhen applying link-state algorithms, a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphical map]] of the network is the fundamental data used for each node. To produce its map, each node floods the entire network with information about the other nodes it can connect to.  Each node then independently assembles this information into a map. Using this map, each router independently determines the least-cost path from itself to every other node using a standard [[Shortest path problem|shortest paths]] algorithm such as [[Dijkstra's algorithm]]. The result is a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree graph]] rooted at the current node, such that the path through the tree from the root to any other node is the least-cost path to that node. This tree then serves to construct the routing table, which specifies the best next hop to get from the current node to any other node.\n\n===Optimized Link State Routing algorithm===\n{{main|Optimized Link State Routing Protocol}}\nA link-state routing algorithm optimized for [[mobile ad hoc network]]s is the optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR).<ref>RFC 3626</ref> OLSR is proactive; it uses Hello and Topology Control (TC) messages to discover and disseminate link-state information through the mobile ad hoc network. Using Hello messages, each node discovers 2-hop neighbor information and elects a set of ''multipoint relays'' (MPRs). MPRs distinguish OLSR from other link-state routing protocols.\n\n===Path-vector protocol===\n{{main|Path-vector routing protocol}}\nDistance vector and link-state routing are both intra-domain routing protocols. They are used inside an [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]], but not between autonomous systems. Both of these routing protocols become intractable in large networks and cannot be used in [[inter-domain]] routing. Distance vector routing is subject to instability if there are more than a few hops in the domain. Link state routing needs significant resources to calculate routing tables. It also creates heavy traffic due to flooding.\n\nPath-vector routing is used for inter-domain routing. It is similar to distance vector routing. Path-vector routing assumes that one node (there can be many) in each autonomous system acts on behalf of the entire autonomous system. This node is called the ''speaker node.'' The speaker node creates a routing table and advertises it to neighboring speaker nodes in neighboring autonomous systems. The idea is the same as distance vector routing except that only speaker nodes in each autonomous system can communicate with each other. The speaker node advertises the path, not the metric, of the nodes in its autonomous system or other autonomous systems.\n\nThe path-vector routing algorithm is similar to the distance vector algorithm in the sense that each border router advertises the destinations it can reach to its neighboring router. However, instead of advertising networks in terms of a destination and the distance to that destination, networks are advertised as destination addresses and path descriptions to reach those destinations. The path, expressed in terms of the domains (or confederations) traversed so far, is carried in a special path attribute that records the sequence of routing domains through which the reachability information has passed. A route is defined as a pairing between a destination and the attributes of the path to that destination, thus the name, path-vector routing; The routers receive a vector that contains paths to a set of destinations.<ref>{{IETF RFC|1322}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n==Path selection==\nPath selection involves applying a [[Metrics (networking)|routing metric]] to multiple routes to select (or predict) the best route. Most routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. [[Multipath routing]] techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.\n\nIn computer networking, the metric is computed by a routing algorithm, and can cover information such as [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], [[network delay]], [[hop count]], path cost, load, [[MTU (networking)|MTU]] (maximum transmission unit), reliability, and communication cost (see e.g. [http://rainer.baumann.info/public/tik262.pdf this survey ] for a list of proposed routing metrics). The routing table stores only the best possible routes, while [[link-state]] or topological databases may store all other information as well.\n\nIn case of overlapping or equal routes, algorithms consider the following elements to decide which routes to install into the routing table (sorted by priority):\n#''Prefix-Length'': where longer subnet masks are preferred (independent of whether it is within a routing protocol or over different routing protocol)\n#''Metric'': where a lower metric/cost is preferred (only valid within one and the same routing protocol)\n#''[[Administrative distance]]'': where a route learned from a more reliable routing protocol is preferred (only valid between different routing protocols)\n\nBecause a routing metric is specific to a given routing protocol, multi-protocol routers must use some external [[heuristic]] to select between routes learned from different routing protocols. [[Cisco]] routers, for example, attribute a value known as the [[administrative distance]] to each route, where smaller administrative distances indicate routes learned from a supposedly more reliable protocol.\n\nA local network administrator, in special cases, can set up host-specific routes to a particular device that provides more control over network usage, permits testing, and better overall security. This is useful for debugging network connections or routing tables.\n\nIn some small systems, a single central device decides ahead of time the complete path of every packet.\nIn some other small systems, whichever edge device injects a packet into the network decides ahead of time the complete path of that particular packet.\nIn both of these systems, that route-planning device needs to know a lot of information about what devices are connected to the network and how they are connected to each other.\nOnce it has this information, it can use an algorithm such as [[A* search algorithm]] to find the best path.\n\nIn high-speed systems, there are so many packets transmitted every second that it is infeasible for a single device to calculate the complete path for each and every packet. Early high-speed systems dealt with this by setting up a [[circuit switching]] [[relay channel]] once for the first packet between some source and some destination; later packets between that same source and that same destination continue to follow the same path without recalculating until the channel [[teardown (communications)|teardown]]. Later high-speed systems inject packets into the network without any one device ever calculating a complete path for that packet\u2014multiple agents.\n\nIn large systems, there are so many connections between devices, and those connections change so frequently, that it is infeasible for any one device to even know how all the devices are connected to each other, much less calculate a complete path through them.\nSuch systems generally use [[hop (networking)#Next hop|next-hop]] routing.\n\nMost systems use a deterministic [[dynamic routing]] algorithm:\nWhen a device chooses a path to a particular final destination, that device always chooses the same path to that destination until it receives information that makes it think some other path is better.\nA few routing algorithms do not use a deterministic algorithm to find the \"best\" link for a packet to get from its original source to its final destination.\nInstead, to avoid congestion in switched systems or network hot spots in packet systems, a few algorithms use a randomized algorithm\u2014Valiant's paradigm\u2014that routes a path to a randomly picked intermediate destination, and from there to its true final destination.<ref>\nMichael Mitzenmacher;  Andr\u00e9a W.

For example, for web requests one can use minimum latency paths to minimize web page load time, or for bulk data transfers one can choose the least utilized path to balance load across the network and increase throughput. A popular path selection objective is to reduce the average completion times of traffic flows and the total network bandwidth consumption which basically leads to better use of network capacity. Recently, a path selection metric was proposed that computes the total number of bytes scheduled on the edges per path as selection metric.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Poster Abstract: Minimizing Flow Completion Times using Adaptive Routing over Inter-Datacenter Wide Area Networks |author= M. Noormohammadpour; C. S.

Raghavendra. |date= 2018 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323723167}}</ref>\n\n==Multiple agents==\nIn some networks, routing is complicated by the fact that no single entity is responsible for selecting paths; instead, multiple entities are involved in selecting paths or even parts of a single path. Complications or inefficiency can result if these entities choose paths to optimize their own objectives, which may conflict with the objectives of other participants.\n\nA classic example involves traffic in a road system, in which each driver picks a path that minimizes their travel time. With such routing, the [[Nash equilibrium|equilibrium]] routes can be longer than optimal for all drivers. In particular, [[Braess' paradox]] shows that adding a new road can ''lengthen'' travel times for all drivers.\n\nIn another model, for example, used for routing [[automated guided vehicle]]s (AGVs) on a terminal, reservations are made for each vehicle to prevent simultaneous use of the same part of an infrastructure. This approach is also referred to as context-aware routing.<ref>\nJonne Zutt, Arjan J.C. van Gemund, Mathijs M. de Weerdt, and Cees Witteveen (2010).

Intelligent Infrastructures, Ch. 14, pp. 355\u2013382. Springer.</ref>\n\nThe Internet is partitioned into [[autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous systems]] (ASs) such as [[internet service provider]]s (ISPs), each of which controls routes involving its network, at multiple levels. First, AS-level paths are selected via the [[Border Gateway Protocol|BGP]] protocol, which produces a sequence of ASs through which packets flow. Each AS may have multiple paths, offered by neighboring ASs, from which to choose. Its decision often involves business relationships with these neighboring ASs,<ref>Matthew Caesar and [[Jennifer Rexford]]. [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/policies.pdf BGP routing policies in ISP networks]. IEEE Network Magazine, special issue on Interdomain Routing, Nov/Dec 2005.</ref> which may be unrelated to path quality or latency. Second, once an AS-level path has been selected, there are often multiple corresponding router-level paths, in part because two ISPs may be connected in multiple locations. In choosing the single router-level path, it is common practice for each ISP to employ [[hot-potato routing]]: sending traffic along the path that minimizes the distance through the ISP's own network\u2014even if that path lengthens the total distance to the destination.\n\nConsider two ISPs, ''A'' and ''B''. Each has a presence in [[New York City|New York]], connected by a fast link with latency 5 [[millisecond|ms]]\u2014and each has a presence in [[London]] connected by a 5 ms link. Suppose both ISPs have trans-Atlantic links that connect their two networks, but ''A'''s link has latency 100 ms and B's has latency 120 ms. When routing a message from a source in ''A'' 's London network to a destination in ''B'' 's New York network, ''A'' may choose to immediately send the message to ''B'' in London. This saves ''A'' the work of sending it along an expensive trans-Atlantic link, but causes the message to experience latency 125 ms when the other route would have been 20 ms faster.\n\nA 2003 measurement study of Internet routes found that, between pairs of neighboring ISPs, more than 30% of paths have inflated latency due to hot-potato routing, with 5% of paths being delayed by at least 12 ms. Inflation due to AS-level path selection, while substantial, was attributed primarily to BGP's lack of a mechanism to directly optimize for latency, rather than to selfish routing policies. It was also suggested that, were an appropriate mechanism in place, ISPs would be willing to cooperate to reduce latency rather than use hot-potato routing.<ref>Neil Spring, Ratul Mahajan, and Thomas Anderson.

Incorrect routing or routing issues cause undesirable performance degradation, [[route flapping|flapping]] and/or downtime. Monitoring routing in a network is achieved using [[route analytics]] tools and techniques.\n\n==Centralized routing==\nIn networks where a logically centralized control is available over the forwarding state, for example, using [[Software Defined Networking|Software-defined networking]], routing techniques can be used that aim to optimize global and network-wide performance metrics.

Broadly, routing is performed in many types of networks, including [[circuit switching|circuit-switched network]]s, such as the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN), and [[computer network]]s, such as the [[Internet]].\n\nIn packet switching networks, routing is the higher-level decision making that directs [[network packet]]s from their source toward their destination through intermediate [[Node (networking)|network nodes]] by specific packet forwarding mechanisms. [[Packet forwarding]] is the transit of network packets from one [[network interface]] to another.  Intermediate nodes are typically [[network hardware]] devices such as [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], or [[network switch|switches]]. General-purpose [[computer]]s also forward packets and perform routing, although they have no specially optimized hardware for the task.\n\nThe routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of [[routing table]]s. Routing tables maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Routing tables may be specified by an administrator, learned by observing network traffic or built with the assistance of [[routing protocol]]s.\n\nRouting, in a narrower sense of the term, often refers to [[IP routing]] and is contrasted with [[bridging (networking)|bridging]]. IP routing assumes that [[network address]]es are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices.  In large networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within [[local area network]]s.\n\n==Delivery schemes==\n{{routing scheme}}<!--{{routing scheme}} links to this section-->\nRouting schemes differ in how they deliver messages:\n*[[Unicast]] delivers a message to a single specific node using a ''one-to-one'' association between a sender and destination: each destination address uniquely identifies a single receiver endpoint.\n*[[Broadcasting (networking)|Broadcast]] delivers a message to all nodes in the network usint a ''one-to-all'' association; a single datagram from one sender is routed to all of the possibly multiple endpoints associated with the broadcast address. The network automatically replicates datagrams as needed to reach all the recipients within the scope of the broadcast, which is generally an entire network subnet.\n*[[Multicast]] delivers a message to a group of nodes that have expressed interest in receiving the message using a ''one-to-many-of-many'' or ''many-to-many-of-many'' association; datagrams are routed simultaneously in a single transmission to many recipients. Multicast differs from broadcast in that the destination address designates a subset, not necessarily all, of the accessible nodes.\n*[[Anycast]] delivers a message to any one out of a group of nodes, typically the one nearest to the source using a ''one-to-one-of-many'' association where datagrams are routed to any single member of a group of potential receivers that are all identified by the same destination address.  The routing algorithm selects the single receiver from the group based on which is the nearest according to some distance measure.\n*[[Geocast]] delivers a message to a group of nodes in a network based on their [[geographic location]]. It is a specialized form of multicast addressing used by some routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks.\n\nUnicast is the dominant form of message delivery on the Internet.  This article focuses on unicast routing algorithms.\n\n==Topology distribution==\nWith [[static routing]], small networks may use manually configured routing tables. Larger networks have complex [[network topology|topologies]] that can change rapidly, making the manual construction of routing tables unfeasible. Nevertheless, most of the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) uses pre-computed routing tables, with fallback routes if the most direct route becomes blocked (see [[routing in the PSTN]]).\n\n[[Dynamic routing]] attempts to solve this problem by constructing routing tables automatically, based on information carried by [[routing protocol]]s, allowing the network to act nearly autonomously in avoiding network failures and blockages. Dynamic routing dominates the Internet. Examples of dynamic-routing protocols and algorithms include [[Routing Information Protocol]] (RIP), [[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF) and [[Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol]] (EIGRP).\n\n===Distance vector algorithms===\n{{main|Distance-vector routing protocol}}\nDistance vector algorithms use the [[Bellman\u2013Ford algorithm]]. This approach assigns a ''cost'' number to each of the links between each node in the network. Nodes send information from point A to point B via the path that results in the lowest ''total cost'' (i.e. the sum of the costs of the links between the nodes used).\n\nWhen a node first starts, it only knows of its immediate neighbors and the direct cost involved in reaching them. (This information \u2014 the list of destinations, the total cost to each, and the ''next hop'' to send data to get there \u2014 makes up the routing table, or ''distance table''.) Each node, on a regular basis, sends to each neighbor node its own current assessment of the total cost to get to all the destinations it knows of. The neighboring nodes examine this information and compare it to what they already know; anything that represents an improvement on what they already have, they insert in their own table. Over time, all the nodes in the network discover the best next hop and total cost for all destinations.\n\nWhen a network node goes down, any nodes that used it as their next hop discard the entry and convey the updated routing information to all adjacent nodes, which in turn repeat the process. Eventually, all the nodes in the network receive the updates and discover new paths to all the destinations that don't involve the down node.\n\n===Link-state algorithms===\n{{main|Link-state routing protocol}}\nWhen applying link-state algorithms, a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphical map]] of the network is the fundamental data used for each node. To produce its map, each node floods the entire network with information about the other nodes it can connect to.  Each node then independently assembles this information into a map. Using this map, each router independently determines the least-cost path from itself to every other node using a standard [[Shortest path problem|shortest paths]] algorithm such as [[Dijkstra's algorithm]]. The result is a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree graph]] rooted at the current node, such that the path through the tree from the root to any other node is the least-cost path to that node. This tree then serves to construct the routing table, which specifies the best next hop to get from the current node to any other node.\n\n===Optimized Link State Routing algorithm===\n{{main|Optimized Link State Routing Protocol}}\nA link-state routing algorithm optimized for [[mobile ad hoc network]]s is the optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR).<ref>RFC 3626</ref> OLSR is proactive; it uses Hello and Topology Control (TC) messages to discover and disseminate link-state information through the mobile ad hoc network. Using Hello messages, each node discovers 2-hop neighbor information and elects a set of ''multipoint relays'' (MPRs). MPRs distinguish OLSR from other link-state routing protocols.\n\n===Path-vector protocol===\n{{main|Path-vector routing protocol}}\nDistance vector and link-state routing are both intra-domain routing protocols. They are used inside an [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]], but not between autonomous systems. Both of these routing protocols become intractable in large networks and cannot be used in [[inter-domain]] routing. Distance vector routing is subject to instability if there are more than a few hops in the domain. Link state routing needs significant resources to calculate routing tables. It also creates heavy traffic due to flooding.\n\nPath-vector routing is used for inter-domain routing. It is similar to distance vector routing. Path-vector routing assumes that one node (there can be many) in each autonomous system acts on behalf of the entire autonomous system. This node is called the ''speaker node.'' The speaker node creates a routing table and advertises it to neighboring speaker nodes in neighboring autonomous systems. The idea is the same as distance vector routing except that only speaker nodes in each autonomous system can communicate with each other. The speaker node advertises the path, not the metric, of the nodes in its autonomous system or other autonomous systems.\n\nThe path-vector routing algorithm is similar to the distance vector algorithm in the sense that each border router advertises the destinations it can reach to its neighboring router. However, instead of advertising networks in terms of a destination and the distance to that destination, networks are advertised as destination addresses and path descriptions to reach those destinations. The path, expressed in terms of the domains (or confederations) traversed so far, is carried in a special path attribute that records the sequence of routing domains through which the reachability information has passed. A route is defined as a pairing between a destination and the attributes of the path to that destination, thus the name, path-vector routing; The routers receive a vector that contains paths to a set of destinations.<ref>{{IETF RFC|1322}}</ref><!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n==Path selection==\nPath selection involves applying a [[Metrics (networking)|routing metric]] to multiple routes to select (or predict) the best route. Most routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. [[Multipath routing]] techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.\n\nIn computer networking, the metric is computed by a routing algorithm, and can cover information such as [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], [[network delay]], [[hop count]], path cost, load, [[MTU (networking)|MTU]] (maximum transmission unit), reliability, and communication cost (see e.g. [http://rainer.baumann.info/public/tik262.pdf this survey ] for a list of proposed routing metrics). The routing table stores only the best possible routes, while [[link-state]] or topological databases may store all other information as well.\n\nIn case of overlapping or equal routes, algorithms consider the following elements to decide which routes to install into the routing table (sorted by priority):\n#''Prefix-Length'': where longer subnet masks are preferred (independent of whether it is within a routing protocol or over different routing protocol)\n#''Metric'': where a lower metric/cost is preferred (only valid within one and the same routing protocol)\n#''[[Administrative distance]]'': where a route learned from a more reliable routing protocol is preferred (only valid between different routing protocols)\n\nBecause a routing metric is specific to a given routing protocol, multi-protocol routers must use some external [[heuristic]] to select between routes learned from different routing protocols. [[Cisco]] routers, for example, attribute a value known as the [[administrative distance]] to each route, where smaller administrative distances indicate routes learned from a supposedly more reliable protocol.\n\nA local network administrator, in special cases, can set up host-specific routes to a particular device that provides more control over network usage, permits testing, and better overall security. This is useful for debugging network connections or routing tables.\n\nIn some small systems, a single central device decides ahead of time the complete path of every packet.\nIn some other small systems, whichever edge device injects a packet into the network decides ahead of time the complete path of that particular packet.\nIn both of these systems, that route-planning device needs to know a lot of information about what devices are connected to the network and how they are connected to each other.\nOnce it has this information, it can use an algorithm such as [[A* search algorithm]] to find the best path.\n\nIn high-speed systems, there are so many packets transmitted every second that it is infeasible for a single device to calculate the complete path for each and every packet. Early high-speed systems dealt with this by setting up a [[circuit switching]] [[relay channel]] once for the first packet between some source and some destination; later packets between that same source and that same destination continue to follow the same path without recalculating until the channel [[teardown (communications)|teardown]]. Later high-speed systems inject packets into the network without any one device ever calculating a complete path for that packet\u2014multiple agents.\n\nIn large systems, there are so many connections between devices, and those connections change so frequently, that it is infeasible for any one device to even know how all the devices are connected to each other, much less calculate a complete path through them.\nSuch systems generally use [[hop (networking)#Next hop|next-hop]] routing.\n\nMost systems use a deterministic [[dynamic routing]] algorithm:\nWhen a device chooses a path to a particular final destination, that device always chooses the same path to that destination until it receives information that makes it think some other path is better.\nA few routing algorithms do not use a deterministic algorithm to find the \"best\" link for a packet to get from its original source to its final destination.\nInstead, to avoid congestion in switched systems or network hot spots in packet systems, a few algorithms use a randomized algorithm\u2014Valiant's paradigm\u2014that routes a path to a randomly picked intermediate destination, and from there to its true final destination.<ref>\nMichael Mitzenmacher;  Andr\u00e9a W.

For example, for web requests one can use minimum latency paths to minimize web page load time, or for bulk data transfers one can choose the least utilized path to balance load across the network and increase throughput. A popular path selection objective is to reduce the average completion times of traffic flows and the total network bandwidth consumption which basically leads to better use of network capacity. Recently, a path selection metric was proposed that computes the total number of bytes scheduled on the edges per path as selection metric.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Poster Abstract: Minimizing Flow Completion Times using Adaptive Routing over Inter-Datacenter Wide Area Networks |author= M.

Complications or inefficiency can result if these entities choose paths to optimize their own objectives, which may conflict with the objectives of other participants.\n\nA classic example involves traffic in a road system, in which each driver picks a path that minimizes their travel time. With such routing, the [[Nash equilibrium|equilibrium]] routes can be longer than optimal for all drivers. In particular, [[Braess' paradox]] shows that adding a new road can ''lengthen'' travel times for all drivers.\n\nIn another model, for example, used for routing [[automated guided vehicle]]s (AGVs) on a terminal, reservations are made for each vehicle to prevent simultaneous use of the same part of an infrastructure. This approach is also referred to as context-aware routing.<ref>\nJonne Zutt, Arjan J.C. van Gemund, Mathijs M. de Weerdt, and Cees Witteveen (2010).

Intelligent Infrastructures, Ch. 14, pp. 355\u2013382. Springer.</ref>\n\nThe Internet is partitioned into [[autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous systems]] (ASs) such as [[internet service provider]]s (ISPs), each of which controls routes involving its network, at multiple levels. First, AS-level paths are selected via the [[Border Gateway Protocol|BGP]] protocol, which produces a sequence of ASs through which packets flow. Each AS may have multiple paths, offered by neighboring ASs, from which to choose. Its decision often involves business relationships with these neighboring ASs,<ref>Matthew Caesar and [[Jennifer Rexford]]. [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/papers/policies.pdf BGP routing policies in ISP networks]. IEEE Network Magazine, special issue on Interdomain Routing, Nov/Dec 2005.</ref> which may be unrelated to path quality or latency. Second, once an AS-level path has been selected, there are often multiple corresponding router-level paths, in part because two ISPs may be connected in multiple locations. In choosing the single router-level path, it is common practice for each ISP to employ [[hot-potato routing]]: sending traffic along the path that minimizes the distance through the ISP's own network\u2014even if that path lengthens the total distance to the destination.\n\nConsider two ISPs, ''A'' and ''B''. Each has a presence in [[New York City|New York]], connected by a fast link with latency 5 [[millisecond|ms]]\u2014and each has a presence in [[London]] connected by a 5 ms link. Suppose both ISPs have trans-Atlantic links that connect their two networks, but ''A'''s link has latency 100 ms and B's has latency 120 ms. When routing a message from a source in ''A'' 's London network to a destination in ''B'' 's New York network, ''A'' may choose to immediately send the message to ''B'' in London. This saves ''A'' the work of sending it along an expensive trans-Atlantic link, but causes the message to experience latency 125 ms when the other route would have been 20 ms faster.\n\nA 2003 measurement study of Internet routes found that, between pairs of neighboring ISPs, more than 30% of paths have inflated latency due to hot-potato routing, with 5% of paths being delayed by at least 12 ms. Inflation due to AS-level path selection, while substantial, was attributed primarily to BGP's lack of a mechanism to directly optimize for latency, rather than to selfish routing policies. It was also suggested that, were an appropriate mechanism in place, ISPs would be willing to cooperate to reduce latency rather than use hot-potato routing.<ref>Neil Spring, Ratul Mahajan, and Thomas Anderson.

Monitoring routing in a network is achieved using [[route analytics]] tools and techniques.\n\n==Centralized routing==\nIn networks where a logically centralized control is available over the forwarding state, for example, using [[Software Defined Networking|Software-defined networking]], routing techniques can be used that aim to optimize global and network-wide performance metrics.

The pubs were targeted because they were popular with [[British Army]] personnel stationed at [[Pirbright|Pirbright barracks]]. Four soldiers and one civilian were killed. Sixty-five people were wounded.\n\nThe bomb in the Horse and Groom detonated at 8:30 pm. It killed Paul Craig (a 22-year-old plasterer), two members of the [[Scots Guards]] and two members of the [[Women's Royal Army Corps]]. The Seven Stars was evacuated after the first blast causing no serious injuries to any customers when the second bomb exploded at 9:00 pm. However the owner of the Seven Stars pub Owen O'Brien and his wife looked for a second device in their pub. When the second explosion occurred O'Brien sustained a fractured skull and his wife a broken leg. Five members of staff and one customer who had just stepped outside when the blast happened received less serious injuries.<ref>Steven P. Moysey - The Road To Balcombe Street: The IRA Reign of Terror in London p.88</ref>\n\nThese attacks were the first in a year-long campaign by an IRA [[Active Service Unit]] who became known as the [[Provisional IRA's Balcombe Street Gang|Balcombe Street Gang]] \u2013 who police arrested in December 1975 after the [[Balcombe Street siege]] leading to their trial and conviction for other murders and offences.<ref>McKee G, Franey R, '''Time Bomb''', 1988, Bloomsbury Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7475-0099-1}}.

Gunner Richard Dunne and Alan Horsley, a sales clerk, died in that explosion. On August 27, 1975 the same IRA unit detonated a bomb in Surrey at the [[Caterham Arms pub bombing|Caterham Arms pub which injured over 30 people]], Surrey police said it was \"a carbon copy of the Guildford bombs\". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch75.htm#Aug|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1975|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe bombings contributed to the speedy and unchallenged passing of the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts]] in November 1974, which were then misused by the [[Metropolitan Police]] to force false confessions from the \"[[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Guildford Four]]\".\n\n==The Guildford Four==\nThe bombings were at the height of [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Metropolitan Police]] were under enormous pressure to apprehend the IRA bombers responsible for the attacks in England. In December 1974 the police arrested three men and a woman, later known as the Guildford Four. They were [[Gerry Conlon]], [[Paul Hill (Guildford Four)|Paul Hill]], [[Patrick Armstrong (Guildford Four)|Patrick Armstrong]] and [[Carole Richardson (Guildford Four)|Carole Richardson]].<ref name=mckee/>\n\nConlon had been in London at the time of the bombings, and had visited his mother's sister, Annie Maguire.

The Maguire Seven were falsely convicted of providing bomb-making material and other support in March 1976 and sentenced to terms varying between four and fourteen years.<ref name=mckee/>\n\nThe Guildford Four were held in prison for fifteen years, while Giuseppe Conlon died near the end of his third year of imprisonment. All the convictions were overturned years later in the appeal courts after it was proved the Guildford Four's convictions had been based on confessions obtained by torture (as were some Maguire Seven confessions), whilst evidence specifically clearing the Four was not reported by the police.<ref name=mckee>McKee G, Franey R, ''Time Bomb'', 1988, pp. 426-36, Bloomsbury Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7475-0099-1}}</ref> \n\nDuring the trial of the \"[[Balcombe Street Siege|Balcombe Street Four]]\" in February 1977, the four IRA members instructed their lawyers to \"draw attention to the fact that four totally innocent people were serving massive sentences\" for three bombings in Woolwich and Guildford.

The pubs were targeted because they were popular with [[British Army]] personnel stationed at [[Pirbright|Pirbright barracks]]. Four soldiers and one civilian were killed. Sixty-five people were wounded.\n\nThe bomb in the Horse and Groom detonated at 8:30 pm. It killed Paul Craig (a 22-year-old plasterer), two members of the [[Scots Guards]] and two members of the [[Women's Royal Army Corps]]. The Seven Stars was evacuated after the first blast causing no serious injuries to any customers when the second bomb exploded at 9:00 pm. However the owner of the Seven Stars pub Owen O'Brien and his wife looked for a second device in their pub. When the second explosion occurred O'Brien sustained a fractured skull and his wife a broken leg. Five members of staff and one customer who had just stepped outside when the blast happened received less serious injuries.<ref>Steven P. Moysey - The Road To Balcombe Street: The IRA Reign of Terror in London p.88</ref>\n\nThese attacks were the first in a year-long campaign by an IRA [[Active Service Unit]] who became known as the [[Provisional IRA's Balcombe Street Gang|Balcombe Street Gang]] \u2013 who police arrested in December 1975 after the [[Balcombe Street siege]] leading to their trial and conviction for other murders and offences.<ref>McKee G, Franey R, '''Time Bomb''', 1988, Bloomsbury Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7475-0099-1}}. Page 18 notes that a new ASU was set up in August 1974 comprising O'Connell, Dowd etc whose first attack was the Guildford Bombings</ref> A similar bomb to those used in Guildford, with the addition of shrapnel, was thrown into the [[Kings Arms, Woolwich|Kings Arms]] pub in [[Woolwich]] on 7 November 1974. Gunner Richard Dunne and Alan Horsley, a sales clerk, died in that explosion. On August 27, 1975 the same IRA unit detonated a bomb in Surrey at the [[Caterham Arms pub bombing|Caterham Arms pub which injured over 30 people]], Surrey police said it was \"a carbon copy of the Guildford bombs\". <ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch75.htm#Aug|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1975|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe bombings contributed to the speedy and unchallenged passing of the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts]] in November 1974, which were then misused by the [[Metropolitan Police]] to force false confessions from the \"[[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Guildford Four]]\".\n\n==The Guildford Four==\nThe bombings were at the height of [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Metropolitan Police]] were under enormous pressure to apprehend the IRA bombers responsible for the attacks in England. In December 1974 the police arrested three men and a woman, later known as the Guildford Four. They were [[Gerry Conlon]], [[Paul Hill (Guildford Four)|Paul Hill]], [[Patrick Armstrong (Guildford Four)|Patrick Armstrong]] and [[Carole Richardson (Guildford Four)|Carole Richardson]].<ref name=mckee/>\n\nConlon had been in London at the time of the bombings, and had visited his mother's sister, Annie Maguire. A few days after the Guildford Four were arrested, the Metropolitan Police arrested Annie Maguire and her family, including Gerry Conlon's father, Patrick \"Giuseppe\" Conlon &ndash; the \"[[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Maguire Seven]]\".<ref name=mckee/>\n\nThe Guildford Four were falsely convicted of the bombings in October 1975 and sentenced to life in prison. The Maguire Seven were falsely convicted of providing bomb-making material and other support in March 1976 and sentenced to terms varying between four and fourteen years.<ref name=mckee/>\n\nThe Guildford Four were held in prison for fifteen years, while Giuseppe Conlon died near the end of his third year of imprisonment. All the convictions were overturned years later in the appeal courts after it was proved the Guildford Four's convictions had been based on confessions obtained by torture (as were some Maguire Seven confessions), whilst evidence specifically clearing the Four was not reported by the police.<ref name=mckee>McKee G, Franey R, ''Time Bomb'', 1988, pp. 426-36, Bloomsbury Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7475-0099-1}}</ref> \n\nDuring the trial of the \"[[Balcombe Street Siege|Balcombe Street Four]]\" in February 1977, the four IRA members instructed their lawyers to \"draw attention to the fact that four totally innocent people were serving massive sentences\" for three bombings in Woolwich and Guildford. The Balcombe Street Four were never charged with these offences. The 1993 movie ''[[In the Name of the Father (film)|In the Name of the Father]]'' is based on these events.<ref>Bergman, Paul and Asimow, Michael (2006).
