Wilkins was a nine-time [[NBA All-Star]], and is widely viewed as one of the best [[slam dunk|dunkers]] in NBA history, earning the nickname \"'''the Human Highlight Film'''\".<ref name=wilkins_summary>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/wilkins_summary.html |title=Dominique Wilkins Summary |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=May 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011052602/http://www.nba.com/history/players/wilkins_summary.html |archive-date=October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2006, Wilkins was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nIn addition to his 11 seasons with the Hawks, Wilkins had short stints with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], the [[Boston Celtics]], [[Panathinaikos BC|Panathinaikos Athens]] (a professional team in [[Greek basketball league system|Greece's top-tier level]] [[Greek Basket League]], with whom he won his first titles, the [[EuroLeague|FIBA European League]] and the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]]), [[Fortitudo Pallacanestro Bologna|Fortitudo Bologna]] (a professional team in [[Italian basketball league system|Italy's top-tier level]] [[Lega Basket Serie A|LBA]]), the [[San Antonio Spurs]], and the [[Orlando Magic]] before he retired in 1999.\n\n==Early life and college==\nWilkins was born in [[Paris, France]] while his father was stationed there as an airman in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. Wilkins' family then moved to Dallas and Baltimore before settling in [[Washington, North Carolina]], where he attended Washington High School.  He was the back-to-back MVP for the team's consecutive Class 3-A State Championships (1978\u20131979). Wilkins was in the \"Faces in the Crowd\" section of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' while in high school for a performance in a game vs. a higher classification school in which he scored 48 points, had 27 rebounds, 9 dunks, and 8 blocks. Wilkins then starred in the [[McDonald's All-American Game]], The Capital Classic, The Kentucky Derby Festival Classic, and The Dapper Dan Classic All-Star Games. He had 16 points and 12 rebounds in the McDonald's, 26 points in the Capital, and 22 points in the Derby Classic. He entered the [[University of Georgia]] in 1979 with an established reputation as an exciting player. Wilkins averaged 21.6 points a game over his career and was named [[SEC Men's Basketball Player of the Year]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1988 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: Dominique Wilkins (b. 1960) |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=May 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=0&url_article_id=303&change_well_id=2== |title=Men's Basketball \u2013 All-Time Award Winners |publisher=Southeastern Conference |accessdate=April 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231531/http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=0&url_article_id=303&change_well_id=2== |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>  He left college after his junior year.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Atlanta Hawks===\nWilkins was selected third overall (behind [[James Worthy]] and [[Terry Cummings]]) by the [[Utah Jazz]] in the [[1982 NBA draft]]. However, Wilkins was not willing to play in Utah. At the same time, the Jazz were reeling from cash flow problems. As a result, the Jazz traded Wilkins to the [[Atlanta Hawks]] several months after the draft for [[John Drew (basketball)|John Drew]], [[Freeman Williams]] and $1 million in cash.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGJkfbA3RE |title=Basketball \u2013 He Got Pushed Away}}</ref> Despite Wilkins's reluctance to play in Utah, the trade is now considered among the most lopsided deals in NBA history, as Drew and Williams would play a combined four seasons for the Jazz.\n\nWilkins averaged more than 25 points per game for ten consecutive seasons, and captured a scoring title in [[1985\u201386 NBA season|1985\u201386]] with an average of 30.3 points per game.\n\nWilkins was instrumental in the Hawks' prominence in the 1980s, when the club recorded four consecutive 50-win seasons during the decade. As Wilkins entered his thirties and the Hawks needed more of an all-around contribution from their star, Wilkins averaged 9.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists during the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]].\n\nA nine-time [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]] and the winner of two [[NBA slam dunk contest]]s, Wilkins registered 26,668 points and 7,169 rebounds in his NBA career. As of 2019, he ranks 13th on the NBA scoring list.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for Points |publisher=Basketball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=Mar 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWilkins' nickname was \"The Human Highlight Film\" for his athletic ability and highlight reel dunks.  His trademark dunk was a powerful one- or two-handed windmill dunks he used to capture the slam dunk contest titles in 1985 and 1990. As a basketball player, he was known as an acrobatic scorer, somewhat of a gunner, though an outstanding finisher and one of the greatest dunkers in NBA history.\n\nHis #21 jersey was retired by the Hawks on January 13, 2001. He is one of five players whose jerseys have been retired by the Hawks.\n\n====Early NBA years====\nWilkins notched his first [[NBA Slam Dunk Contest|Slam-Dunk Championship]] at the [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] in Indianapolis during the 1984\u201385 season. He went on to finish the season with a 27.4 scoring average, good for sixth in the NBA. He ranked second on the Hawks in rebounding (6.9 rpg) and steals (135). For the first of two straight seasons, he led the NBA in field-goal attempts, with 1,891. After going 0-for-11 from the three-point line the previous season, Wilkins made 25 of 81 three-point shots in 1984\u201385. He also shot better than 80 percent from the free throw line for the first of 10 consecutive seasons. Despite Wilkins's efforts, Atlanta finished 34\u201348 and failed to reach the playoffs.\n\nWilkins exploded into the NBA's elite circle in 1985\u201386, winning the league scoring title with an average of 30.3 points per game. He was an NBA All-Star for the first time and was voted to the All-NBA First Team at the end of the season. He failed in his bid to repeat as NBA Slam-Dunk champion, his competition coming from an unlikely source. The Hawks had signed 5-foot-7 [[Spud Webb|Anthony \"Spud\" Webb]] as a free agent prior to the season, and Webb dazzled the All-Star Saturday crowd in Dallas by soaring more than {{convert|4|ft|m}} to the basket on each of his dunk attempts. Atlanta turned its fortunes around in dramatic fashion, winning 16 more games in the 1985\u201386 season to finish 50\u201332 for the year. Wilkins scored 57 points in one game and ranked among the Hawks' leaders in rebounding (7.9 rpg), steals (138), and free-throw percentage (.818). Atlanta beat the [[Detroit Pistons]] in four games in the first round of the playoffs, but the Hawks could not get past the eventual NBA-champion [[Boston Celtics]], losing four games to one in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Wilkins averaged 28.6 points in the nine playoff games.\n\nAfter playing as a reserve the previous year, Wilkins became the first Atlanta Hawks player to start in an NBA All-Star Game since [[Edward Johnson, Jr.|Eddie Johnson]] in 1981. Wilkins finished the year second in the league in scoring (29.0 ppg) to [[Michael Jordan]]'s 37.1 points per game. He scored the 10,000th point of his career against the [[Chicago Bulls]] on April 16 and was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the season's end. Atlanta went into the season with high expectations after a 50\u201332 mark the previous year, and the Hawks totaled a franchise-record 57 victories. [[Doc Rivers]], [[Kevin Willis]], [[Tree Rollins]], and [[Mike McGee (basketball)|Mike McGee]] contributed as the club made it through the first round of the NBA playoffs before losing in the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Detroit Pistons. Wilkins averaged 26.8 points during the postseason, the second of six straight playoffs in which he would average at least 20 points.\n\n====Late 1980's====\nIn the [[1987\u201388 NBA season|1987\u201388 season]], Wilkins posted the highest scoring average of his career and finished second to Jordan in the NBA scoring race. He averaged 30.7 points for the Hawks, but Jordan bested him at 35.0. Jordan also defeated Wilkins for the Slam Dunk Championship at the NBA All-Star Weekend in Chicago. Wilkins earned a berth on the All-NBA Second Team and became the first Hawks player to be named NBA Player of the Week three times in a season. In his third straight All-Star Game appearance, Wilkins scored 29 points on 12-of-22 shooting, leading the East squad to a 138\u2013133 victory.\n\nAtlanta (50\u201332) won at least 50 games for the third straight season and advanced to the [[1988 NBA playoffs|1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals]] before losing to the [[Boston Celtics]] in seven games. In Game 7 on May 22, Wilkins and [[Larry Bird]] carried their respective teams to a thrilling finish, trading bucket for bucket in the fourth quarter until Boston won with a 118\u2013116 victory. Wilkins finished with 47 points and Bird had 34-with 20 of his points tallied in the fourth quarter. \"The basket was like a well,\" remembered Wilkins. \"I couldn\u2019t miss. He couldn\u2019t miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I\u2019ve ever played in or seen played. It was two guys who just did not want to lose.\"\n\nDuring the 1989 season with the Hawks, Wilkins's scoring average dropped slightly to 26.2, good for seventh in the league, but he was an All-Star for the fourth straight year. He shot a career-best .844 from the free-throw line and ranked second on the Hawks with 117 steals. Basketball writers selected him to the All-NBA Third Team at season's end. The Hawks added [[Reggie Theus]] and [[Moses Malone]] to the team in 1988\u201389. Malone averaged 20.2 points and finished fourth in the league with his 11.8 rebounding average. Theus averaged 15.8 points. Without {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Kevin Willis]], however, who missed the entire season with a fractured left foot, Atlanta lost to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in the first round. Wilkins averaged 27.2 points in the playoffs.\n\nWilkins returned to dunking prominence in 1989\u201390 by edging out the [[Sacramento Kings]]\u2019 [[Kenny Smith]] for his second NBA Slam-Dunk championship. He averaged 26.7 points to finish fifth in the NBA scoring race. He led the Hawks in steals for the first time since 1985\u201386, finishing with 126. His .484 field-goal percentage was the best since his rookie season, and for the sixth straight year he did not foul out of a game. Nonetheless, Atlanta struggled to a 41\u201341 record in [[Mike Fratello]]'s last season as head coach, failing to make the playoffs for only the second time in Wilkins' career.\n\n====1990's====\nWilkins averaged a career-high 9.0 rebounds in [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391]], leading the Hawks in that category for the first time in his nine NBA seasons. He also led the team in scoring for the eighth straight year, finishing at 25.9 points per game\u2014seventh best in the NBA. He registered a career-high 265 assists while developing a three-point shot he would use more and more in the later stages of his career. He hit 85-of-249 from long range for a .341 percentage, by far his most prolific three-point numbers to date. Wilkins made his sixth All-Star Game appearance, scoring 12 points in the East's 116\u2013114 victory over the West. He was selected to the All-NBA Second Team for the third time in his career. Atlanta returned to the playoffs after a year's absence, drawing the defending NBA champion [[1990\u201391 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]] in the first round. The Hawks pushed the Pistons to a fifth game, but Detroit routed Atlanta, 113\u201381, in Game 5. Wilkins averaged 20.8 points in the five games, but shot .372 from the field and .133 from three-point range.\n\nIn the 1991\u201392 season, Wilkins' ruptured his Achilles tendon against the [[1991\u201392 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]] on January 28, 1992. He underwent surgery on January 30. He also scored the 20,000th point of his career, becoming only the 16th player at the time to reach that plateau. On the day of the injury, Wilkins was named a reserve on the Eastern Conference All-Star Team. His 28.1 scoring average was his highest in five years, and the 52 points he scored in a double-overtime game on December 7 against the [[1991\u201392 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] were the most by an NBA player that season.\n\nThe following season, Wilkins would recover from his injury and eventually win the NBA Comeback Player of the Year award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ballislife.com/32-year-old-dominique-wilkins-injures-achilles-in-1992-comes-back-next-year-to-average-30-ppg/ |title=32 year old Dominique Wilkins injures Achilles in 1992 / Averages 30 Points the following season |publisher=Ballislife.com |date=April 13, 2013 |accessdate=December 23, 2019}}</ref> He scored an average of 27.7 points per game in the first month of the season. On December 8, he set an NBA record of free throws made in a game without a miss, hitting 23 free throws against the Chicago Bulls. He then suffered a setback when he fractured the ring finger on his right hand on December 15, sitting out the next 11 games. He returned to rack up 29.4 points per game on .487 shooting in January, then added 31.5 points per game on .519 shooting in February. By the end of the season, his scoring average was up to 29.9, second in the league behind Michael Jordan's 32.6. When Wilkins scored his 31st point in a February 2 game against the [[1992\u201393 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle SuperSonics]], he broke [[Bob Pettit]]'s franchise scoring record of 20,880 points. He had developed into a full-fledged three-point threat, hitting 120 of 316 attempts from long range to shatter his previous career bests. He was later selected to the All-NBA Second Team. The [[1992\u201393 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]] swept the Hawks in the first round of the playoffs 3\u20130.\n\n===Los Angeles Clippers and Boston===\nWilkins showed no signs of fading in his 12th NBA season, even after a tumultuous midseason trade. After 11\u00bd years with the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Wilkins was traded to the [[1993\u201394 Los Angeles Clippers season|Los Angeles Clippers]] on February 24 in exchange for [[Danny Manning]].  This is still the only time in NBA history a team in first place in their conference traded its leading scorer after the All-Star break. Prior to the trade Wilkins averaged 24.4 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 2.3 assists for Atlanta, leading the club to a 36\u201316 record. At midseason he appeared in his eighth NBA All-Star Game. Hawks management and new coach [[Lenny Wilkens]] claimed Manning and his skills would help the team more during the stretch run. However, many believed that money was the primary reason the Hawks made the trade.  Wilkins' contract expired at the end of the season, and the Hawks may not have been willing to commit a new long-term contract to a player who was almost 35 years old.\n\nThe top-seeded Hawks lost in the conference semifinals to the [[1993\u201394 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]]. Wilkins left Atlanta as the team's all-time leading scorer with 23,292 points. In his final 25 games of the season Wilkins averaged 29.1 points and 7.0 rebounds. On March 25 he returned to Atlanta in a Clippers uniform and tallied 36 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. Overall, Wilkins' 26.0 scoring average ranked fourth in the NBA. He concluded the season with 24,019 career points, placing ninth on the NBA's all-time list.  Wilkins became a free agent after the 1993\u201394 season and signed with the Boston Celtics. Shortly after the signing, he helped [[United States men's national basketball team|Dream Team II]] to a gold medal at the [[1994 FIBA World Championship|1994 World Championship of Basketball]].\n\n===Panathinaikos: EuroLeague champion===\nUnhappy with his role on a rebuilding Celtics team, in August 1995, Wilkins signed a two-year contract worth US$7 million with [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]] of the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]]<ref>{{cite news|author=The ''Inquirer'' Staff|url=http://articles.philly.com/1995-08-13/sports/25708447_1_dominique-wilkins-panathinaikos-athens-atp-championship|title=Dominique Wilkins Will Play In Greece|agency=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''|date=August 13, 1995|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}</ref> that meant a US$3.5 million net sum per year in salary.<ref>{{cite news|last=Avdi\u0107|first=Edin|url=http://mondo.rs/a779484/Kolumne/Edin-Avdic/Dominik-Vilkins-Edin-Avdic-kolumna.html|title=Kao na filmu|agency=mondo.rs|date=March 19, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Stankovi\u0107|first=Vladimir|url=http://www.euroleague.net/features/voices/2012-2013/vladimir-stankovic/i/107160/dominique-wilkins-an-american-from-paris|title=Dominique Wilkins, An American From Paris|agency=Euroleague.net|date=January 13, 2013|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}</ref> The club further provided him with a four-story, marbled villa of his choosing, a maid, two cars, and even paid his Greek taxes for him.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thomsen|first=Ian|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/12/sports/IHT-easy-money-opens-door-to-hard-times-in-greece-for-a-former-nba.html|title='Easy Money' Opens Door to Hard Times in Greece for a Former NBA Star|agency=''[[New York Times]]''|date=12 March 1996|accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nPlaying on a roster alongside [[Stojko Vrankovi\u0107]], [[Panagiotis Giannakis]], [[Fragiskos Alvertis]] and [[Nikos Oikonomou]], thirty-five-year-old Wilkins started off the season sluggishly, frequently getting targeted by the team's disciplinarian, defensively-minded head coach [[Bo\u017eidar Maljkovi\u0107]], even getting fined US$50,000 by the club for making too many personal trips back to the United States during the season, and complaining about being treated \"like a dog\" by coach Maljkovi\u0107.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/1996/4/article/wilkins-shoots-panathinaikos-past-cska/325718.html|title=Wilkins Shoots Panathinaikos Past CSKA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710033256/https://themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/1996/4/article/wilkins-shoots-panathinaikos-past-cska/325718.html|archive-date=July 10, 2015|agency=''[[The Moscow Times]]''|date=April 11, 1996|accessdate=July 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Wilkins soon managed to adapt and thrive in the European game, averaging 20.1 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 1.8 assists, in 33.2 minutes per game, in 17 games played for Panathinaikos in the [[1995\u201396 FIBA European League|1995\u201396 season]] of the [[EuroLeague]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_KNce8jInH7Qj1EsyH5rjn2.teamID_1369.compID_,Uz02qBnJiADOq5VntEf53.season_1996.roundID_2567.playerID_19042.html |title=Jacques Dominique Wilkins (Panathinaikos BSA Athens) |publisher=Fibaeurope.com |date=October 30, 1926 |accessdate=May 17, 2014}}</ref> and helping them win the title of the [[EuroLeague Final Four]] of 1996. He particularly excelled in key EuroLeague contests such as the deciding game 3 of the EuroLeague quarterfinals best-of-3 series, versus [[Pallacanestro Treviso|Treviso]], where he recorded 26 points and 7 rebounds, as Panathinaikos eked out a hard-fought 64\u201365 victory on the road, to progress to the EuroLeague Final Four. During the [[1996 FIBA European League Final Four|1996 EuroLeague Final Four]], that was held in his birthplace of Paris, Wilkins had 35 points and 8 rebounds in the semifinal against [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]], and a double-double, with 16 points and 10 rebounds against [[FC Barcelona (basketball)|Barcelona]] in the [[EuroLeague Final|final]]. His performances earned him the [[EuroLeague Final Four MVP|Final Four MVP]] award. He also won the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]] with Panathinaikos, and was named [[Greek Basketball Cup MVP|the MVP of the Cup Final]]. However, he failed to win the national championship of the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] 1995\u201396 season, as his team, Panathinaikos, lost the Greek League Finals to their arch-rivals, [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], 3 games to 2. In the Greek League, he averaged 21.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 1.7 assists and 32.0 minutes per game in 30 games played.<ref>[http://widgets.baskethotel.com/site/esake/player/5110253/ Dominique Wilkins Career stats & achievements.]</ref>\n\n===San Antonio, Bologna and Orlando===\nHe returned to the NBA before the 1996\u201397 season, signing a contract as a free agent with the [[San Antonio Spurs]], to solidify their bench scoring. Wilkins led the team with an average of 18.2 points per game in 1996\u201397. He would be the last Spur to wear #21 before [[Tim Duncan]].\n\nHowever, after one season, Wilkins once again went overseas, this time signing a contract with [[Fortitudo Pallacanestro Bologna|Teamsystem Bologna]] of the [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian League]], for the 1997\u201398 season. With Bologna, he averaged 17.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.5 minutes per game, in 34 games played in the Italian League.<ref>[http://web.legabasket.it/player/?id=WIL-DOM-60 Dominique Wilkins Teamsystem Bologna {{in lang|it}}.]</ref> With Bologna, he also averaged 17.9 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.8 minutes per game, in 20 games played in the [[1997\u201398 FIBA EuroLeague|FIBA EuroLeague 1997\u201398 season]].<ref>[http://www.fibaeurope.com/compID_,Uz02qBnJiADOq5VntEf53.season_1998.roundID_2569.playerID_19042.teamID_2622.html Jacques Dominique Wilkins.]</ref> Wilkins returned to play his last season in the NBA, during the 1998\u201399 campaign, alongside his brother [[Gerald Wilkins]], with the Orlando Magic. In 27 games, he averaged 5.0 points per game and 2.6 rebounds per game.\n\n===Slam dunk contests===\nWilkins participated in five [[Slam Dunk Contest|slam dunk contests]], winning two. His first was in 1984, in Denver. Wilkins finished third, behind [[Larry Nance]] and [[Julius Erving]]. In 1985, in Indianapolis, he beat [[Michael Jordan]] in the finals. In Dallas in 1986, a Jordan-Wilkins rematch was put on hold, since Jordan was injured. Wilkins reached the finals where he was defeated by his 5'7\" teammate, [[Spud Webb]].\n\nThe 1988 Slam Dunk Contest featured a rematch between Wilkins and Jordan. Jordan won in the final, beating Wilkins by two points. Wilkins' first two dunks of the finals earned scores of 50 from judges. On his third and final attempt, Wilkins' completed a thunderous windmill dunk from the left side. Soaring high above the floor, Wilkins' head nearly hit the rim. Wilkins received a standing ovation from players and fans in attendance, but was awarded a low score of 45. The judges opened the door for Jordan to win the Chicago-based event with a score of only 48. Jordan closed out the event with 50-point dunk, taking perhaps the contest's most controversial crown.\n\nIn 1990 Wilkins made his final appearance in the Slam Dunk Contest, going up against new promising stars such as [[Kenny Smith]], [[Scottie Pippen]] and [[Kenny Walker]] (the 1989 champion). He defeated [[Kenny Smith]] of the [[Sacramento Kings]] in the final round.\n\n== Later life ==\nSince 2004, Wilkins has served as the Hawks' Vice President of Basketball. He works in a variety of management functions within the franchise's basketball and business areas. Wilkins is responsible for advising the Hawks's senior management team on basketball-related issues and is a goodwill ambassador for the community.<ref name=\"vice president\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/hawks/news/dominique_wilkins_040331.html|title=Dominique Wilkins:VP-Basketball, ''Atlanta Spirit, LLC''|work=www.nba.com|accessdate=September 11, 2009}}</ref> Wilkins also serves as a color analyst for Hawks games on FSN South, pairing with long-time play-by-play announcer [[Bob Rathbun]].\n\nWilkins was a judge in the [[56th National Hockey League All-Star Game|2008 NHL All-Star Game]] Breakaway Challenge, which was held in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Kevin|title=Ovechkin, Chara dazzle in NHL All-Star prelude|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2008-01-26-all-star-skills_N.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=April 10, 2015|date=January 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Wilkins participated in the [[NBA All-Star Weekend Celebrity Game|McDonald's All-Star Celebrity Game]] during [[NBA All-Star Weekend]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/2009/allstar2009/01/16/mcdonalds.celebrity.game/index.html |title=T.O. pulls in another MVP trophy in wild celebrity game |publisher=Nba.com |date=February 14, 2009 |accessdate=May 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429025722/http://www.nba.com/2009/allstar2009/01/16/mcdonalds.celebrity.game/index.html |archivedate=April 29, 2009 }}</ref> and in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge against a team of [[Philippine Basketball Association]] All-Stars.

Hawks]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Wilkins was a nine-time [[NBA All-Star]], and is widely viewed as one of the best [[slam dunk|dunkers]] in NBA history, earning the nickname \"'''the Human Highlight Film'''\".<ref name=wilkins_summary>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/wilkins_summary.html |title=Dominique Wilkins Summary |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=May 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011052602/http://www.nba.com/history/players/wilkins_summary.html |archive-date=October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2006, Wilkins was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nIn addition to his 11 seasons with the Hawks, Wilkins had short stints with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], the [[Boston Celtics]], [[Panathinaikos BC|Panathinaikos Athens]] (a professional team in [[Greek basketball league system|Greece's top-tier level]] [[Greek Basket League]], with whom he won his first titles, the [[EuroLeague|FIBA European League]] and the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]]), [[Fortitudo Pallacanestro Bologna|Fortitudo Bologna]] (a professional team in [[Italian basketball league system|Italy's top-tier level]] [[Lega Basket Serie A|LBA]]), the [[San Antonio Spurs]], and the [[Orlando Magic]] before he retired in 1999.\n\n==Early life and college==\nWilkins was born in [[Paris, France]] while his father was stationed there as an airman in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. Wilkins' family then moved to Dallas and Baltimore before settling in [[Washington, North Carolina]], where he attended Washington High School.  He was the back-to-back MVP for the team's consecutive Class 3-A State Championships (1978\u20131979). Wilkins was in the \"Faces in the Crowd\" section of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' while in high school for a performance in a game vs. a higher classification school in which he scored 48 points, had 27 rebounds, 9 dunks, and 8 blocks. Wilkins then starred in the [[McDonald's All-American Game]], The Capital Classic, The Kentucky Derby Festival Classic, and The Dapper Dan Classic All-Star Games. He had 16 points and 12 rebounds in the McDonald's, 26 points in the Capital, and 22 points in the Derby Classic. He entered the [[University of Georgia]] in 1979 with an established reputation as an exciting player. Wilkins averaged 21.6 points a game over his career and was named [[SEC Men's Basketball Player of the Year]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1988 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: Dominique Wilkins (b. 1960) |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=May 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=0&url_article_id=303&change_well_id=2== |title=Men's Basketball \u2013 All-Time Award Winners |publisher=Southeastern Conference |accessdate=April 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231531/http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=0&url_article_id=303&change_well_id=2== |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>  He left college after his junior year.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Atlanta Hawks===\nWilkins was selected third overall (behind [[James Worthy]] and [[Terry Cummings]]) by the [[Utah Jazz]] in the [[1982 NBA draft]]. However, Wilkins was not willing to play in Utah. At the same time, the Jazz were reeling from cash flow problems. As a result, the Jazz traded Wilkins to the [[Atlanta Hawks]] several months after the draft for [[John Drew (basketball)|John Drew]], [[Freeman Williams]] and $1 million in cash.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGJkfbA3RE |title=Basketball \u2013 He Got Pushed Away}}</ref> Despite Wilkins's reluctance to play in Utah, the trade is now considered among the most lopsided deals in NBA history, as Drew and Williams would play a combined four seasons for the Jazz.\n\nWilkins averaged more than 25 points per game for ten consecutive seasons, and captured a scoring title in [[1985\u201386 NBA season|1985\u201386]] with an average of 30.3 points per game.\n\nWilkins was instrumental in the Hawks' prominence in the 1980s, when the club recorded four consecutive 50-win seasons during the decade. As Wilkins entered his thirties and the Hawks needed more of an all-around contribution from their star, Wilkins averaged 9.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists during the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]].\n\nA nine-time [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]] and the winner of two [[NBA slam dunk contest]]s, Wilkins registered 26,668 points and 7,169 rebounds in his NBA career. As of 2019, he ranks 13th on the NBA scoring list.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/pts_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for Points |publisher=Basketball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=Mar 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWilkins' nickname was \"The Human Highlight Film\" for his athletic ability and highlight reel dunks.  His trademark dunk was a powerful one- or two-handed windmill dunks he used to capture the slam dunk contest titles in 1985 and 1990. As a basketball player, he was known as an acrobatic scorer, somewhat of a gunner, though an outstanding finisher and one of the greatest dunkers in NBA history.\n\nHis #21 jersey was retired by the Hawks on January 13, 2001. He is one of five players whose jerseys have been retired by the Hawks.\n\n====Early NBA years====\nWilkins notched his first [[NBA Slam Dunk Contest|Slam-Dunk Championship]] at the [[NBA All-Star Weekend]] in Indianapolis during the 1984\u201385 season. He went on to finish the season with a 27.4 scoring average, good for sixth in the NBA. He ranked second on the Hawks in rebounding (6.9 rpg) and steals (135). For the first of two straight seasons, he led the NBA in field-goal attempts, with 1,891. After going 0-for-11 from the three-point line the previous season, Wilkins made 25 of 81 three-point shots in 1984\u201385. He also shot better than 80 percent from the free throw line for the first of 10 consecutive seasons. Despite Wilkins's efforts, Atlanta finished 34\u201348 and failed to reach the playoffs.\n\nWilkins exploded into the NBA's elite circle in 1985\u201386, winning the league scoring title with an average of 30.3 points per game. He was an NBA All-Star for the first time and was voted to the All-NBA First Team at the end of the season. He failed in his bid to repeat as NBA Slam-Dunk champion, his competition coming from an unlikely source. The Hawks had signed 5-foot-7 [[Spud Webb|Anthony \"Spud\" Webb]] as a free agent prior to the season, and Webb dazzled the All-Star Saturday crowd in Dallas by soaring more than {{convert|4|ft|m}} to the basket on each of his dunk attempts. Atlanta turned its fortunes around in dramatic fashion, winning 16 more games in the 1985\u201386 season to finish 50\u201332 for the year. Wilkins scored 57 points in one game and ranked among the Hawks' leaders in rebounding (7.9 rpg), steals (138), and free-throw percentage (.818). Atlanta beat the [[Detroit Pistons]] in four games in the first round of the playoffs, but the Hawks could not get past the eventual NBA-champion [[Boston Celtics]], losing four games to one in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Wilkins averaged 28.6 points in the nine playoff games.\n\nAfter playing as a reserve the previous year, Wilkins became the first Atlanta Hawks player to start in an NBA All-Star Game since [[Edward Johnson, Jr.|Eddie Johnson]] in 1981. Wilkins finished the year second in the league in scoring (29.0 ppg) to [[Michael Jordan]]'s 37.1 points per game. He scored the 10,000th point of his career against the [[Chicago Bulls]] on April 16 and was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the season's end. Atlanta went into the season with high expectations after a 50\u201332 mark the previous year, and the Hawks totaled a franchise-record 57 victories. [[Doc Rivers]], [[Kevin Willis]], [[Tree Rollins]], and [[Mike McGee (basketball)|Mike McGee]] contributed as the club made it through the first round of the NBA playoffs before losing in the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Detroit Pistons. Wilkins averaged 26.8 points during the postseason, the second of six straight playoffs in which he would average at least 20 points.\n\n====Late 1980's====\nIn the [[1987\u201388 NBA season|1987\u201388 season]], Wilkins posted the highest scoring average of his career and finished second to Jordan in the NBA scoring race. He averaged 30.7 points for the Hawks, but Jordan bested him at 35.0. Jordan also defeated Wilkins for the Slam Dunk Championship at the NBA All-Star Weekend in Chicago. Wilkins earned a berth on the All-NBA Second Team and became the first Hawks player to be named NBA Player of the Week three times in a season. In his third straight All-Star Game appearance, Wilkins scored 29 points on 12-of-22 shooting, leading the East squad to a 138\u2013133 victory.\n\nAtlanta (50\u201332) won at least 50 games for the third straight season and advanced to the [[1988 NBA playoffs|1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals]] before losing to the [[Boston Celtics]] in seven games. In Game 7 on May 22, Wilkins and [[Larry Bird]] carried their respective teams to a thrilling finish, trading bucket for bucket in the fourth quarter until Boston won with a 118\u2013116 victory. Wilkins finished with 47 points and Bird had 34-with 20 of his points tallied in the fourth quarter. \"The basket was like a well,\" remembered Wilkins. \"I couldn\u2019t miss. He couldn\u2019t miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I\u2019ve ever played in or seen played. It was two guys who just did not want to lose.\"\n\nDuring the 1989 season with the Hawks, Wilkins's scoring average dropped slightly to 26.2, good for seventh in the league, but he was an All-Star for the fourth straight year. He shot a career-best .844 from the free-throw line and ranked second on the Hawks with 117 steals. Basketball writers selected him to the All-NBA Third Team at season's end. The Hawks added [[Reggie Theus]] and [[Moses Malone]] to the team in 1988\u201389. Malone averaged 20.2 points and finished fourth in the league with his 11.8 rebounding average. Theus averaged 15.8 points. Without {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Kevin Willis]], however, who missed the entire season with a fractured left foot, Atlanta lost to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in the first round. Wilkins averaged 27.2 points in the playoffs.\n\nWilkins returned to dunking prominence in 1989\u201390 by edging out the [[Sacramento Kings]]\u2019 [[Kenny Smith]] for his second NBA Slam-Dunk championship. He averaged 26.7 points to finish fifth in the NBA scoring race. He led the Hawks in steals for the first time since 1985\u201386, finishing with 126. His .484 field-goal percentage was the best since his rookie season, and for the sixth straight year he did not foul out of a game. Nonetheless, Atlanta struggled to a 41\u201341 record in [[Mike Fratello]]'s last season as head coach, failing to make the playoffs for only the second time in Wilkins' career.\n\n====1990's====\nWilkins averaged a career-high 9.0 rebounds in [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391]], leading the Hawks in that category for the first time in his nine NBA seasons. He also led the team in scoring for the eighth straight year, finishing at 25.9 points per game\u2014seventh best in the NBA. He registered a career-high 265 assists while developing a three-point shot he would use more and more in the later stages of his career. He hit 85-of-249 from long range for a .341 percentage, by far his most prolific three-point numbers to date. Wilkins made his sixth All-Star Game appearance, scoring 12 points in the East's 116\u2013114 victory over the West. He was selected to the All-NBA Second Team for the third time in his career. Atlanta returned to the playoffs after a year's absence, drawing the defending NBA champion [[1990\u201391 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]] in the first round. The Hawks pushed the Pistons to a fifth game, but Detroit routed Atlanta, 113\u201381, in Game 5. Wilkins averaged 20.8 points in the five games, but shot .372 from the field and .133 from three-point range.\n\nIn the 1991\u201392 season, Wilkins' ruptured his Achilles tendon against the [[1991\u201392 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]] on January 28, 1992. He underwent surgery on January 30. He also scored the 20,000th point of his career, becoming only the 16th player at the time to reach that plateau. On the day of the injury, Wilkins was named a reserve on the Eastern Conference All-Star Team. His 28.1 scoring average was his highest in five years, and the 52 points he scored in a double-overtime game on December 7 against the [[1991\u201392 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] were the most by an NBA player that season.\n\nThe following season, Wilkins would recover from his injury and eventually win the NBA Comeback Player of the Year award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ballislife.com/32-year-old-dominique-wilkins-injures-achilles-in-1992-comes-back-next-year-to-average-30-ppg/ |title=32 year old Dominique Wilkins injures Achilles in 1992 / Averages 30 Points the following season |publisher=Ballislife.com |date=April 13, 2013 |accessdate=December 23, 2019}}</ref> He scored an average of 27.7 points per game in the first month of the season. On December 8, he set an NBA record of free throws made in a game without a miss, hitting 23 free throws against the Chicago Bulls. He then suffered a setback when he fractured the ring finger on his right hand on December 15, sitting out the next 11 games. He returned to rack up 29.4 points per game on .487 shooting in January, then added 31.5 points per game on .519 shooting in February. By the end of the season, his scoring average was up to 29.9, second in the league behind Michael Jordan's 32.6. When Wilkins scored his 31st point in a February 2 game against the [[1992\u201393 Seattle SuperSonics season|Seattle SuperSonics]], he broke [[Bob Pettit]]'s franchise scoring record of 20,880 points. He had developed into a full-fledged three-point threat, hitting 120 of 316 attempts from long range to shatter his previous career bests. He was later selected to the All-NBA Second Team. The [[1992\u201393 Chicago Bulls season|Chicago Bulls]] swept the Hawks in the first round of the playoffs 3\u20130.\n\n===Los Angeles Clippers and Boston===\nWilkins showed no signs of fading in his 12th NBA season, even after a tumultuous midseason trade. After 11\u00bd years with the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Wilkins was traded to the [[1993\u201394 Los Angeles Clippers season|Los Angeles Clippers]] on February 24 in exchange for [[Danny Manning]].  This is still the only time in NBA history a team in first place in their conference traded its leading scorer after the All-Star break. Prior to the trade Wilkins averaged 24.4 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 2.3 assists for Atlanta, leading the club to a 36\u201316 record. At midseason he appeared in his eighth NBA All-Star Game. Hawks management and new coach [[Lenny Wilkens]] claimed Manning and his skills would help the team more during the stretch run. However, many believed that money was the primary reason the Hawks made the trade.  Wilkins' contract expired at the end of the season, and the Hawks may not have been willing to commit a new long-term contract to a player who was almost 35 years old.\n\nThe top-seeded Hawks lost in the conference semifinals to the [[1993\u201394 Indiana Pacers season|Indiana Pacers]]. Wilkins left Atlanta as the team's all-time leading scorer with 23,292 points. In his final 25 games of the season Wilkins averaged 29.1 points and 7.0 rebounds. On March 25 he returned to Atlanta in a Clippers uniform and tallied 36 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. Overall, Wilkins' 26.0 scoring average ranked fourth in the NBA. He concluded the season with 24,019 career points, placing ninth on the NBA's all-time list.  Wilkins became a free agent after the 1993\u201394 season and signed with the Boston Celtics. Shortly after the signing, he helped [[United States men's national basketball team|Dream Team II]] to a gold medal at the [[1994 FIBA World Championship|1994 World Championship of Basketball]].\n\n===Panathinaikos: EuroLeague champion===\nUnhappy with his role on a rebuilding Celtics team, in August 1995, Wilkins signed a two-year contract worth US$7 million with [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]] of the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]]<ref>{{cite news|author=The ''Inquirer'' Staff|url=http://articles.philly.com/1995-08-13/sports/25708447_1_dominique-wilkins-panathinaikos-athens-atp-championship|title=Dominique Wilkins Will Play In Greece|agency=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''|date=August 13, 1995|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}</ref> that meant a US$3.5 million net sum per year in salary.<ref>{{cite news|last=Avdi\u0107|first=Edin|url=http://mondo.rs/a779484/Kolumne/Edin-Avdic/Dominik-Vilkins-Edin-Avdic-kolumna.html|title=Kao na filmu|agency=mondo.rs|date=March 19, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Stankovi\u0107|first=Vladimir|url=http://www.euroleague.net/features/voices/2012-2013/vladimir-stankovic/i/107160/dominique-wilkins-an-american-from-paris|title=Dominique Wilkins, An American From Paris|agency=Euroleague.net|date=January 13, 2013|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}</ref> The club further provided him with a four-story, marbled villa of his choosing, a maid, two cars, and even paid his Greek taxes for him.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thomsen|first=Ian|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/12/sports/IHT-easy-money-opens-door-to-hard-times-in-greece-for-a-former-nba.html|title='Easy Money' Opens Door to Hard Times in Greece for a Former NBA Star|agency=''[[New York Times]]''|date=12 March 1996|accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nPlaying on a roster alongside [[Stojko Vrankovi\u0107]], [[Panagiotis Giannakis]], [[Fragiskos Alvertis]] and [[Nikos Oikonomou]], thirty-five-year-old Wilkins started off the season sluggishly, frequently getting targeted by the team's disciplinarian, defensively-minded head coach [[Bo\u017eidar Maljkovi\u0107]], even getting fined US$50,000 by the club for making too many personal trips back to the United States during the season, and complaining about being treated \"like a dog\" by coach Maljkovi\u0107.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/1996/4/article/wilkins-shoots-panathinaikos-past-cska/325718.html|title=Wilkins Shoots Panathinaikos Past CSKA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710033256/https://themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/free/1996/4/article/wilkins-shoots-panathinaikos-past-cska/325718.html|archive-date=July 10, 2015|agency=''[[The Moscow Times]]''|date=April 11, 1996|accessdate=July 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Wilkins soon managed to adapt and thrive in the European game, averaging 20.1 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 1.8 assists, in 33.2 minutes per game, in 17 games played for Panathinaikos in the [[1995\u201396 FIBA European League|1995\u201396 season]] of the [[EuroLeague]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_KNce8jInH7Qj1EsyH5rjn2.teamID_1369.compID_,Uz02qBnJiADOq5VntEf53.season_1996.roundID_2567.playerID_19042.html |title=Jacques Dominique Wilkins (Panathinaikos BSA Athens) |publisher=Fibaeurope.com |date=October 30, 1926 |accessdate=May 17, 2014}}</ref> and helping them win the title of the [[EuroLeague Final Four]] of 1996. He particularly excelled in key EuroLeague contests such as the deciding game 3 of the EuroLeague quarterfinals best-of-3 series, versus [[Pallacanestro Treviso|Treviso]], where he recorded 26 points and 7 rebounds, as Panathinaikos eked out a hard-fought 64\u201365 victory on the road, to progress to the EuroLeague Final Four. During the [[1996 FIBA European League Final Four|1996 EuroLeague Final Four]], that was held in his birthplace of Paris, Wilkins had 35 points and 8 rebounds in the semifinal against [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]], and a double-double, with 16 points and 10 rebounds against [[FC Barcelona (basketball)|Barcelona]] in the [[EuroLeague Final|final]]. His performances earned him the [[EuroLeague Final Four MVP|Final Four MVP]] award. He also won the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]] with Panathinaikos, and was named [[Greek Basketball Cup MVP|the MVP of the Cup Final]]. However, he failed to win the national championship of the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] 1995\u201396 season, as his team, Panathinaikos, lost the Greek League Finals to their arch-rivals, [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], 3 games to 2. In the Greek League, he averaged 21.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 1.7 assists and 32.0 minutes per game in 30 games played.<ref>[http://widgets.baskethotel.com/site/esake/player/5110253/ Dominique Wilkins Career stats & achievements.]</ref>\n\n===San Antonio, Bologna and Orlando===\nHe returned to the NBA before the 1996\u201397 season, signing a contract as a free agent with the [[San Antonio Spurs]], to solidify their bench scoring. Wilkins led the team with an average of 18.2 points per game in 1996\u201397. He would be the last Spur to wear #21 before [[Tim Duncan]].\n\nHowever, after one season, Wilkins once again went overseas, this time signing a contract with [[Fortitudo Pallacanestro Bologna|Teamsystem Bologna]] of the [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian League]], for the 1997\u201398 season. With Bologna, he averaged 17.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.5 minutes per game, in 34 games played in the Italian League.<ref>[http://web.legabasket.it/player/?id=WIL-DOM-60 Dominique Wilkins Teamsystem Bologna {{in lang|it}}.]</ref> With Bologna, he also averaged 17.9 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 1.7 assists, in 33.8 minutes per game, in 20 games played in the [[1997\u201398 FIBA EuroLeague|FIBA EuroLeague 1997\u201398 season]].<ref>[http://www.fibaeurope.com/compID_,Uz02qBnJiADOq5VntEf53.season_1998.roundID_2569.playerID_19042.teamID_2622.html Jacques Dominique Wilkins.]</ref> Wilkins returned to play his last season in the NBA, during the 1998\u201399 campaign, alongside his brother [[Gerald Wilkins]], with the Orlando Magic. In 27 games, he averaged 5.0 points per game and 2.6 rebounds per game.\n\n===Slam dunk contests===\nWilkins participated in five [[Slam Dunk Contest|slam dunk contests]], winning two. His first was in 1984, in Denver. Wilkins finished third, behind [[Larry Nance]] and [[Julius Erving]]. In 1985, in Indianapolis, he beat [[Michael Jordan]] in the finals. In Dallas in 1986, a Jordan-Wilkins rematch was put on hold, since Jordan was injured. Wilkins reached the finals where he was defeated by his 5'7\" teammate, [[Spud Webb]].\n\nThe 1988 Slam Dunk Contest featured a rematch between Wilkins and Jordan. Jordan won in the final, beating Wilkins by two points. Wilkins' first two dunks of the finals earned scores of 50 from judges. On his third and final attempt, Wilkins' completed a thunderous windmill dunk from the left side. Soaring high above the floor, Wilkins' head nearly hit the rim. Wilkins received a standing ovation from players and fans in attendance, but was awarded a low score of 45. The judges opened the door for Jordan to win the Chicago-based event with a score of only 48. Jordan closed out the event with 50-point dunk, taking perhaps the contest's most controversial crown.\n\nIn 1990 Wilkins made his final appearance in the Slam Dunk Contest, going up against new promising stars such as [[Kenny Smith]], [[Scottie Pippen]] and [[Kenny Walker]] (the 1989 champion). He defeated [[Kenny Smith]] of the [[Sacramento Kings]] in the final round.\n\n== Later life ==\nSince 2004, Wilkins has served as the Hawks' Vice President of Basketball. He works in a variety of management functions within the franchise's basketball and business areas. Wilkins is responsible for advising the Hawks's senior management team on basketball-related issues and is a goodwill ambassador for the community.<ref name=\"vice president\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/hawks/news/dominique_wilkins_040331.html|title=Dominique Wilkins:VP-Basketball, ''Atlanta Spirit, LLC''|work=www.nba.com|accessdate=September 11, 2009}}</ref> Wilkins also serves as a color analyst for Hawks games on FSN South, pairing with long-time play-by-play announcer [[Bob Rathbun]].\n\nWilkins was a judge in the [[56th National Hockey League All-Star Game|2008 NHL All-Star Game]] Breakaway Challenge, which was held in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Kevin|title=Ovechkin, Chara dazzle in NHL All-Star prelude|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2008-01-26-all-star-skills_N.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=April 10, 2015|date=January 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Wilkins participated in the [[NBA All-Star Weekend Celebrity Game|McDonald's All-Star Celebrity Game]] during [[NBA All-Star Weekend]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/2009/allstar2009/01/16/mcdonalds.celebrity.game/index.html |title=T.O. pulls in another MVP trophy in wild celebrity game |publisher=Nba.com |date=February 14, 2009 |accessdate=May 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429025722/http://www.nba.com/2009/allstar2009/01/16/mcdonalds.celebrity.game/index.html |archivedate=April 29, 2009 }}</ref> and in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge against a team of [[Philippine Basketball Association]] All-Stars.

Berkeley that he completed after his initial retirement from the NBA. Since founding St. HOPE in 1989, Johnson has been active in education reform. As Mayor of Sacramento, Johnson launched two education initiatives: Stand UP and Sacramento READS!, to benefit students in Sacramento. Johnson also helped to deter the [[Sacramento Kings]] basketball team from moving to Anaheim, and, later, to Seattle, Washington.\n\n==Early life==\nJohnson, the son of Georgia West and Lawrence Johnson, was born March 4, 1966, in Sacramento. After his father died in a boating accident when he was three, Johnson was raised by his grandparents, the Peat family. He attended [[Sacramento High School]], where he starred in both baseball and basketball. In his senior year, Johnson led the state of California in scoring (32.5 ppg) and was named the Northern California Player of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nba.com/suns/news/00382488.html|title=Kevin Johnson: The Spirit of Giving|author=Jeramie McPeek|date=December 1, 1995}}</ref>\n\n==Basketball career==\n\n===University of California===\nJohnson accepted a scholarship to play basketball for the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. As a four-year starter, Johnson ended his college career in 1987 as the school's all-time leader in assists (since eclipsed by [[Jason Kidd]]), steals, and scoring (since eclipsed by [[Lamond Murray]], [[Sean Lampley]], [[Patrick Christopher]], [[Joe Shipp]] and [[Jerome Randle]]).<ref>http://www.calbears.com/documents/2016/11/11/2016_Cal_Info_GUide.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://igs.berkeley.edu/people/nac/johnson.html|title=Kevin Johnson|publisher= IGS National Advisory Council}}</ref> Johnson was named to the [[List of All-Pacific-12 Conference men's basketball teams|Pac-10's All-Conference]] First Team in his junior and senior seasons, averaging 17.2 points and 5 assists in his final year.

After playing a couple games with Oakland's minor-league team in [[Modesto, California]] during the summer of 1986, Johnson ended his baseball career, finding the road to professional baseball more arduous and risky compared to basketball.\n\n===Cleveland Cavaliers===\nFollowing his senior season of college basketball, the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] selected Johnson with the seventh pick in the [[1987 NBA draft]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VYCSNjk_sg|title=1987 NBA Draft \u22127- Kevin Johnson, California}}</ref> Originally drafted by Cleveland to challenge the incumbent point guard [[Mark Price]] for the starting spot, Johnson found himself playing limited minutes as Price's backup during the [[1987\u201388 NBA season]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ilovethisgamesite.wordpress.com/2016/03/31/kevin-johnson/|title=Kevin Johnson|date=March 31, 2016|access-date=April 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Phoenix Suns===\nOn February 28, 1988, Johnson, [[Mark West (basketball)|Mark West]], [[Tyrone Corbin]], and a future draft pick were traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] in exchange for forward [[Larry Nance]], [[Mike Sanders (basketball)|Mike Sanders]], and a future draft pick.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://basketball.realgm.com/player/Kevin_Johnson/Summary/1183|title=Kevin Johnson|publisher=RealGM Basketball|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> Adjusting quickly to the change of scenery and much-increased playing time, Johnson excelled and the league named him the NBA Rookie of the Month for April 1988 as he averaged 15.1 points, an 86.4% free throw percentage, 10.6 assists, and 5.6 rebounds.<ref name=\"basketball-reference.com\"/>\n\nIn his first full season with Phoenix, Johnson grew into one of the game's elite players, averaging 20.4 points, 12.2 assists, a 50.5% field goal percentage, and an 88.2% free-throw percentage.<ref name=\"basketball-reference.com\"/> With those numbers, Johnson joined [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Isiah Thomas]] as the only players in NBA history to average at least 20 points and 12 assists in a season. His rapid improvement earned him the 1988\u201389 [[NBA Most Improved Player Award|NBA's Most Improved Player Award]]. The 1988\u201389 season was the first of three straight seasons in which Johnson averaged at least 20 points and 10 assists, joining [[Oscar Robertson]] and Isiah Thomas as the only players in league history to accomplish that feat. It also represented the beginning of a new era for the previously moribund Suns' franchise. In K.J.'s first seven full seasons in Phoenix from 1989 to 1995, the Suns won the most regular season games in the NBA (394, an average of 56 and never fewer than 53), constituting the only club to win at least 50 every year during that span, and they won the second-most playoff games (46), trailing only the Chicago Bulls.\n\nJohnson received berths to the [[List of NBA All-Stars|NBA All-Star]] Team in 1990, 1991, and 1994. In the 1991 All-Star Game in Charlotte, Johnson wore number 41 instead of his familiar number 7. [[NBA on NBC|NBC]] announcers [[Bob Costas]] and [[Mike Fratello]] speculated that the decision represented K.J.'s quiet way of honoring teammate Mark West, the Suns' stoic, largely unrecognized center who thanklessly executed the dirty work on the glass and in the paint.<ref name=\"basketball-reference.com\"/>\n\nIn the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], Johnson started alongside [[Magic Johnson]] in the Western Conference backcourt. In anticipation of the game, the ''Sporting News'' asked whether K.J. may have surpassed Magic as the best player on the court.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnske02.html|title=Kevin Johnson|publisher=Sports Reference LLC. |accessdate=January 20, 2009}}</ref> The previous spring in the 1990 Western Conference Semifinals, Johnson led the Suns past Magic's league-best, 63-win [[Los Angeles Lakers]], four games to one. Over the last two games, Johnson closed out the series by averaging 33.5 points and a dozen assists as the Suns won both Game Four and Game Five, with K.J. vastly outplaying Magic Johnson in the fourth quarter of both contests. Indeed, Johnson's clutch performances led Hall of Fame center and NBC commentator [[Bill Walton]] to later remark, \"Kevin Johnson ... really came to the top of this league in the 1990 playoffs when he waxed Magic Johnson and the Lakers in the early rounds. Kevin Johnson\u2014and the Suns\u2014taking care of business in 1990, four to one over the Lakers ... Kevin Johnson just totally outplaying Magic.\"<ref>See NBC's telecast of Game Seven of the 1995 Western Conference Semifinals, Houston at Phoenix, during the second quarter, on May 20, 1995.</ref> Johnson's performance during the 1990 playoffs led the Suns to a second consecutive berth in the Western Conference Finals as Phoenix became the only team to ever defeat [[John Stockton]]'s Jazz (55 wins) and Magic Johnson's Lakers (63 wins) in the same postseason.\n\nJohnson made the playoffs every year of his career after his rookie season, reversing the fortunes of the perennially losing Phoenix Suns. The [[1992\u201393 Phoenix Suns season|1992\u201393 Suns]], led by Johnson and new teammate [[Charles Barkley]], posted an NBA-best 62\u201320 record and managed to make it to the [[1993 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they lost to the [[Michael Jordan]]-led [[Chicago Bulls]] four games to two. Johnson averaged 17.8 points and 7.9 assists in the playoffs and established an NBA record for Finals minutes played by logging 62 minutes in Game 3 (a 129\u2013121 triple-OT victory) vs. the Bulls.<ref name=\"basketball-reference.com\"/>\n\nBut even before Johnson played his first regular season game with Charles Barkley, he suffered an undiagnosed [[sports hernia]] in October 1992 when he attempted to lift heavy-set rookie teammate [[Oliver Miller]] off the ground during warmups before a preseason game.<ref>Lee Shappell, ''Phoenix Suns: Rising to the Top with the \"Team of Oddities\"'' (Champaign, Illinois: Sagamore, 1993), 115.</ref><ref name=\"web.archive.org\">https://web.archive.org/web/20020207070743/http://www.nba.com/suns/news/00382486.html</ref> By the middle of the 1995\u201396 season, Johnson had suffered a second undiagnosed  [[sports hernia]].<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> Primarily due to the groin, hamstring, quadriceps, and other muscle strains stemming from these undiagnosed hernias, Johnson missed 109 regular season games during his four seasons with Barkley from 1992\u201393 through 1995\u201396 (although he only missed one playoff game during his entire career). When diligent off-season workouts during the summer of 1996 failed to erase the abdominal and groin pain that had been plaguing Johnson since the middle of the last season, the Suns' doctors finally diagnosed the second hernia just before the start of training camp in the fall of 1996. Then, during surgery to repair the  [[sports hernia]], the Phoenix doctors discovered the second, \"hidden\" hernia that had existed for four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/28/sports/surgery-for-suns-guard.html |title=Surgery for Suns Guard \u2013 New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=September 28, 1996 |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/suns/news/00382487.html |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=December 14, 2001 |accessdate=December 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212132630/http://www.nba.com/suns/news/00382487.html |archivedate=December 12, 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/suns/news/00382486.html |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=February 7, 2002 |accessdate=December 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925122234/http://www.nba.com/suns/news/00382486.html |archivedate=September 25, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nDespite the undiagnosed hernia problems, K.J. continued to thrive in the postseason like virtually no other point guard during the 1990s.\n\nIn 1994, he averaged 26.6 points and 9.6 assists in the postseason, scoring 38 points three different times in ten games and averaging 11.0 assists in those three contests.\n\nIn 1995, after an injury-riddled regular season, Johnson returned to form in the postseason. He averaged 24.8 points on 57.3% shooting from the field and 9.3 assists in ten games, including 43 points (18\u201324 FG) with 9 assists, 6 rebounds, 3 steals, and just 1 turnover in Game Four of the Western Conference Semifinals at Houston and 46 points (21\u201322 FT) with 10 assists against only 1 turnover in Game Seven. During that series, K.J. sank more three-pointers (5) than he'd hit in the entire 1994\u201395 regular season (4).\n\nIn game four of the previous year's series with Houston, Johnson completed a remarkable play, driving the baseline and dunking over Rockets' center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]. The shot became an oft-played highlight for the ages and was part of a second consecutive 38-point, 12-assist effort by the point guard.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVcSndz52DE|title=Kevin Johnson posterize Olajuwon 1994 WCSF G4}}</ref>\n\n===International competition===\nIn the summer of 1994, Johnson played with the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national team]], otherwise known as Dream Team II, in the [[1994 FIBA World Championship]], reuniting with old teammate and point guard rival Mark Price to win the gold medal. Johnson led Dream Team II in both total assists (31) and assists per game (3.9), while shooting 47.1% (16\u201334) from the field and 50.0% (16\u201332) on two-point field goal attempts. The U.S. head coach, Don Nelson, stated, \"I really like having KJ on the court. The thing that stood out is how he sacrificed his scoring to be a distributor of the ball and make his team win. We didn't need his offense on this team. We did need his defense, penetration and assists.

St. HOPE eventually expanded to run as a nonprofit umbrella organization that consisted of three divisions: St. HOPE Academy, St. HOPE Public Schools, and St. HOPE Development Corporation. This encompassed the new vision to be a nonprofit community development corporation whose mission is to \"revitalize communities through public education, civic leadership, economic development, and the arts.\" Johnson served as CEO of St. HOPE until January 2008.\n\nThe St. HOPE Development Corporation, founded in 1994, has focused its efforts on Oak Park. The Development Corporation has enabled the renovation of a number of projects including a historic bank building that is now a local [[U.S. Bancorp|U.S. Bank]] branch, a Victorian house that has been converted to office space, and a 25,000 square foot art gallery and retail complex that includes the Guild Theater and 40 Acres Art Gallery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sthopepublicschools.org/office/press_releases/SHPS%20Opens%20First%20National%20School%20in%20Harlem%208.12.08.pdf|title=St. HOPE Public Schools Opens First National School in Harlem|author=Lesley Miller|date=August 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSt. HOPE Public Schools is a pre-K-through-12th-grade independent [[Charter schools in the United States|charter school]] system that provides education to nearly 2,000 students in seven small schools.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20148956,00.html|title=Rebound Artist|author=Alex Tresniowski|magazine=People|date=December 15, 2003}}</ref> One of the schools St. HOPE impacted was Sacramento High School (colloquially known as Sac High and now the [[Sacramento Charter High School]]), where three generations of Johnson's family including him attended.

On September 2, 2003 Sac High reopened as Sacramento Charter High School, a charter school with 1,450 students. Since St. HOPE's involvement with Sac High, student performance has improved. In 2010 Sac High's API score improved to 719, compared to 610 in 2006.

Berkeley that he completed after his initial retirement from the NBA. Since founding St. HOPE in 1989, Johnson has been active in education reform. As Mayor of Sacramento, Johnson launched two education initiatives: Stand UP and Sacramento READS!, to benefit students in Sacramento. Johnson also helped to deter the [[Sacramento Kings]] basketball team from moving to Anaheim, and, later, to Seattle, Washington.\n\n==Early life==\nJohnson, the son of Georgia West and Lawrence Johnson, was born March 4, 1966, in Sacramento. After his father died in a boating accident when he was three, Johnson was raised by his grandparents, the Peat family. He attended [[Sacramento High School]], where he starred in both baseball and basketball. In his senior year, Johnson led the state of California in scoring (32.5 ppg) and was named the Northern California Player of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nba.com/suns/news/00382488.html|title=Kevin Johnson: The Spirit of Giving|author=Jeramie McPeek|date=December 1, 1995}}</ref>\n\n==Basketball career==\n\n===University of California===\nJohnson accepted a scholarship to play basketball for the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. As a four-year starter, Johnson ended his college career in 1987 as the school's all-time leader in assists (since eclipsed by [[Jason Kidd]]), steals, and scoring (since eclipsed by [[Lamond Murray]], [[Sean Lampley]], [[Patrick Christopher]], [[Joe Shipp]] and [[Jerome Randle]]).<ref>http://www.calbears.com/documents/2016/11/11/2016_Cal_Info_GUide.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://igs.berkeley.edu/people/nac/johnson.html|title=Kevin Johnson|publisher= IGS National Advisory Council}}</ref> Johnson was named to the [[List of All-Pacific-12 Conference men's basketball teams|Pac-10's All-Conference]] First Team in his junior and senior seasons, averaging 17.2 points and 5 assists in his final year.

His rapid improvement earned him the 1988\u201389 [[NBA Most Improved Player Award|NBA's Most Improved Player Award]]. The 1988\u201389 season was the first of three straight seasons in which Johnson averaged at least 20 points and 10 assists, joining [[Oscar Robertson]] and Isiah Thomas as the only players in league history to accomplish that feat. It also represented the beginning of a new era for the previously moribund Suns' franchise. In K.J.'s first seven full seasons in Phoenix from 1989 to 1995, the Suns won the most regular season games in the NBA (394, an average of 56 and never fewer than 53), constituting the only club to win at least 50 every year during that span, and they won the second-most playoff games (46), trailing only the Chicago Bulls.\n\nJohnson received berths to the [[List of NBA All-Stars|NBA All-Star]] Team in 1990, 1991, and 1994. In the 1991 All-Star Game in Charlotte, Johnson wore number 41 instead of his familiar number 7. [[NBA on NBC|NBC]] announcers [[Bob Costas]] and [[Mike Fratello]] speculated that the decision represented K.J.'s quiet way of honoring teammate Mark West, the Suns' stoic, largely unrecognized center who thanklessly executed the dirty work on the glass and in the paint.<ref name=\"basketball-reference.com\"/>\n\nIn the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], Johnson started alongside [[Magic Johnson]] in the Western Conference backcourt. In anticipation of the game, the ''Sporting News'' asked whether K.J. may have surpassed Magic as the best player on the court.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnske02.html|title=Kevin Johnson|publisher=Sports Reference LLC. |accessdate=January 20, 2009}}</ref> The previous spring in the 1990 Western Conference Semifinals, Johnson led the Suns past Magic's league-best, 63-win [[Los Angeles Lakers]], four games to one. Over the last two games, Johnson closed out the series by averaging 33.5 points and a dozen assists as the Suns won both Game Four and Game Five, with K.J. vastly outplaying Magic Johnson in the fourth quarter of both contests. Indeed, Johnson's clutch performances led Hall of Fame center and NBC commentator [[Bill Walton]] to later remark, \"Kevin Johnson ... really came to the top of this league in the 1990 playoffs when he waxed Magic Johnson and the Lakers in the early rounds. Kevin Johnson\u2014and the Suns\u2014taking care of business in 1990, four to one over the Lakers ... Kevin Johnson just totally outplaying Magic.\"<ref>See NBC's telecast of Game Seven of the 1995 Western Conference Semifinals, Houston at Phoenix, during the second quarter, on May 20, 1995.</ref> Johnson's performance during the 1990 playoffs led the Suns to a second consecutive berth in the Western Conference Finals as Phoenix became the only team to ever defeat [[John Stockton]]'s Jazz (55 wins) and Magic Johnson's Lakers (63 wins) in the same postseason.\n\nJohnson made the playoffs every year of his career after his rookie season, reversing the fortunes of the perennially losing Phoenix Suns. The [[1992\u201393 Phoenix Suns season|1992\u201393 Suns]], led by Johnson and new teammate [[Charles Barkley]], posted an NBA-best 62\u201320 record and managed to make it to the [[1993 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they lost to the [[Michael Jordan]]-led [[Chicago Bulls]] four games to two. Johnson averaged 17.8 points and 7.9 assists in the playoffs and established an NBA record for Finals minutes played by logging 62 minutes in Game 3 (a 129\u2013121 triple-OT victory) vs. the Bulls.<ref name=\"basketball-reference.com\"/>\n\nBut even before Johnson played his first regular season game with Charles Barkley, he suffered an undiagnosed [[sports hernia]] in October 1992 when he attempted to lift heavy-set rookie teammate [[Oliver Miller]] off the ground during warmups before a preseason game.<ref>Lee Shappell, ''Phoenix Suns: Rising to the Top with the \"Team of Oddities\"'' (Champaign, Illinois: Sagamore, 1993), 115.</ref><ref name=\"web.archive.org\">https://web.archive.org/web/20020207070743/http://www.nba.com/suns/news/00382486.html</ref> By the middle of the 1995\u201396 season, Johnson had suffered a second undiagnosed  [[sports hernia]].<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> Primarily due to the groin, hamstring, quadriceps, and other muscle strains stemming from these undiagnosed hernias, Johnson missed 109 regular season games during his four seasons with Barkley from 1992\u201393 through 1995\u201396 (although he only missed one playoff game during his entire career). When diligent off-season workouts during the summer of 1996 failed to erase the abdominal and groin pain that had been plaguing Johnson since the middle of the last season, the Suns' doctors finally diagnosed the second hernia just before the start of training camp in the fall of 1996. Then, during surgery to repair the  [[sports hernia]], the Phoenix doctors discovered the second, \"hidden\" hernia that had existed for four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/28/sports/surgery-for-suns-guard.html |title=Surgery for Suns Guard \u2013 New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=September 28, 1996 |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/suns/news/00382487.html |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=December 14, 2001 |accessdate=December 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212132630/http://www.nba.com/suns/news/00382487.html |archivedate=December 12, 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/suns/news/00382486.html |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=February 7, 2002 |accessdate=December 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925122234/http://www.nba.com/suns/news/00382486.html |archivedate=September 25, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nDespite the undiagnosed hernia problems, K.J. continued to thrive in the postseason like virtually no other point guard during the 1990s.\n\nIn 1994, he averaged 26.6 points and 9.6 assists in the postseason, scoring 38 points three different times in ten games and averaging 11.0 assists in those three contests.\n\nIn 1995, after an injury-riddled regular season, Johnson returned to form in the postseason. He averaged 24.8 points on 57.3% shooting from the field and 9.3 assists in ten games, including 43 points (18\u201324 FG) with 9 assists, 6 rebounds, 3 steals, and just 1 turnover in Game Four of the Western Conference Semifinals at Houston and 46 points (21\u201322 FT) with 10 assists against only 1 turnover in Game Seven. During that series, K.J. sank more three-pointers (5) than he'd hit in the entire 1994\u201395 regular season (4).\n\nIn game four of the previous year's series with Houston, Johnson completed a remarkable play, driving the baseline and dunking over Rockets' center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]. The shot became an oft-played highlight for the ages and was part of a second consecutive 38-point, 12-assist effort by the point guard.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVcSndz52DE|title=Kevin Johnson posterize Olajuwon 1994 WCSF G4}}</ref>\n\n===International competition===\nIn the summer of 1994, Johnson played with the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. national team]], otherwise known as Dream Team II, in the [[1994 FIBA World Championship]], reuniting with old teammate and point guard rival Mark Price to win the gold medal. Johnson led Dream Team II in both total assists (31) and assists per game (3.9), while shooting 47.1% (16\u201334) from the field and 50.0% (16\u201332) on two-point field goal attempts. The U.S. head coach, Don Nelson, stated, \"I really like having KJ on the court. The thing that stood out is how he sacrificed his scoring to be a distributor of the ball and make his team win. We didn't need his offense on this team. We did need his defense, penetration and assists.

management, sports management, and business acquisition. A key component of The Kevin Johnson Corporation includes appearances and public speaking engagements for corporations, academic institutions, and community organizations.\n\n==St. HOPE==\nIn 1989, while still an NBA player, Johnson founded St. HOPE (Helping Others Pursue Excellence) as an after-school program for kids in his native [[Oak Park, Sacramento, California|Oak Park]] neighborhood of Sacramento, California. St. HOPE eventually expanded to run as a nonprofit umbrella organization that consisted of three divisions: St. HOPE Academy, St. HOPE Public Schools, and St. HOPE Development Corporation. This encompassed the new vision to be a nonprofit community development corporation whose mission is to \"revitalize communities through public education, civic leadership, economic development, and the arts.\" Johnson served as CEO of St. HOPE until January 2008.\n\nThe St. HOPE Development Corporation, founded in 1994, has focused its efforts on Oak Park. The Development Corporation has enabled the renovation of a number of projects including a historic bank building that is now a local [[U.S. Bancorp|U.S. Bank]] branch, a Victorian house that has been converted to office space, and a 25,000 square foot art gallery and retail complex that includes the Guild Theater and 40 Acres Art Gallery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sthopepublicschools.org/office/press_releases/SHPS%20Opens%20First%20National%20School%20in%20Harlem%208.12.08.pdf|title=St. HOPE Public Schools Opens First National School in Harlem|author=Lesley Miller|date=August 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSt. HOPE Public Schools is a pre-K-through-12th-grade independent [[Charter schools in the United States|charter school]] system that provides education to nearly 2,000 students in seven small schools.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20148956,00.html|title=Rebound Artist|author=Alex Tresniowski|magazine=People|date=December 15, 2003}}</ref> One of the schools St. HOPE impacted was Sacramento High School (colloquially known as Sac High and now the [[Sacramento Charter High School]]), where three generations of Johnson's family including him attended.

On September 2, 2003 Sac High reopened as Sacramento Charter High School, a charter school with 1,450 students. Since St. HOPE's involvement with Sac High, student performance has improved. In 2010 Sac High's API score improved to 719, compared to 610 in 2006. The number of students who completed all courses required for [[University of California]] or [[California State University]] Admission also rose between those years from 84% to 90.6%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sachigh.org/pdfs/10-11SCHSSARCpub11-12.pdf|title=Executive Summary School Accountability Report Card, 2010\u201311}}</ref>\n\nThese improved test scores attracted the attention of a school in New York and St. HOPE eventually expanded into Harlem at the St. HOPE Leadership Academy Charter School which opened in 2008. Since 2007, the decision to expand St. HOPE to New York has been taught as a case study in the Entrepreneurship in Education Reform class at [[Harvard Business School]]. Following presentation of the case study, Johnson discusses it over lunch with the Harvard students and faculty. The class works as a feeder program for students to participate in the Mayoral Fellowship Program in Sacramento.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/centennial/businesssummit/business-society/the-role-of-social-entrepreneurship-in-transforming-usa-public-education.pdf|title=The Role of Social Entrepreneurship in Transforming U.S.A.

He played 14 years in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) with the [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Miami Heat]], and [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. He won a bronze medal with the [[1988 United States men's Olympic basketball team|U.S. national team]] at the [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], and a gold medal at the [[1994 FIBA World Championship]].<ref>[http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_1994.html 1994 USA Basketball] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126102608/http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_1994.html |date=November 26, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nBorn and raised in [[Traverse City, Michigan]], Majerle starred for [[Central High School (Traverse City)|Traverse City High School]] (now Central) and [[Central Michigan Chippewas men's basketball|Central Michigan University]] in [[Mount Pleasant, Michigan|Mount Pleasant]],<ref name=ruggd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vVpWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=te8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7041%2C10560363 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=''(Knight-Ridder)'' |last=Longman |first=Jere |title=Rugged Majerle making a name |date=August 31, 1988 |page=D2}}</ref> where he played for four years with averages of 21.8 points and 8.9 rebounds a game. He held the school season record for points until [[Marcus Keene]] broke the mark in the [[2016-17 Central Michigan Chippewas men's basketball team|2016-17 season]].\n\nMajerle's great-grandfather Frank Majerle Sr. emigrated to the United States in 1901 at age 20 from what is now [[Slovenia]], but was then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. Frank Sr. settled in [[Haring, Michigan]], and married American-born Anna Suhorepec (anglicised to Suhropetz) whose parents were also from [[Yugoslavia]], more specifically Slovenia.\n\n==NBA career==\n\n===Phoenix Suns (1988\u20131995)===\nThe Suns selected Majerle with the 14th pick of the [[1988 NBA draft]], which the Suns acquired (along with [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]]) in a trade from the Cleveland Cavaliers for [[Larry Nance]]. During the draft, he was promptly booed when his name was announced over the public address system. Suns coach [[Cotton Fitzsimmons]] publicly chastised the Suns fans and told them \"you'll be sorry you ever booed this young man\". In his rookie season Majerle only played in 54 games and started in 5, averaging 8.6 points as a bench player. The Suns would win 55 games and make the playoffs, and Majerle increased his scoring average to 14.3 points a game as Phoenix advanced all the way to the Western Conference Finals before losing to the defending champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]].\n\nThe young Majerle would continue to be used as a backup for the next two seasons, and would become popular for his impressive jumping ability and \"thunderous\" [[slam dunk]] that would lead to his nickname \"Thunder Dan\". During the [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390 season]], he would start in 23 games, increasing his scoring average to 11 points a game as the Suns again advanced to the Western Conference Finals where this time they were eliminated by the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. Despite another successful season for Majerle and the Suns in the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]], they would fall in the first round of the playoffs to the [[Utah Jazz]]. Majerle had become an effective three-point shooter and defensive specialist, and would be named to the 1990\u201391 NBA All-Defensive Second team at the conclusion of the season.\n\nThe 1992 season would feature more improvement for Majerle, who had become an even more effective three-point shooter and defensive specialist. Despite starting in just 15 of the 82 games he played in, Majerle was selected to play in the [[1992 NBA All-Star Game]]. The Suns again made the playoffs, but lost in the conference semifinals to Portland. In the offseason, Phoenix managed to pull off a major step towards an NBA Title, as they acquired superstar forward [[Charles Barkley]] in a trade with the [[Philadelphia 76ers]].\n\n====1993: Trip to the Finals====\nThe Suns had improved significantly with the addition of Barkley, while the trade itself which featured the departure of guard [[Jeff Hornacek]] meant that Majerle would now serve as the team's starting shooting guard. The result would be a 62-win season for Phoenix, with Barkley winning the Most Valuable Player Award and Majerle finishing second on the team in scoring while being named to his second NBA All-Defensive Second Team. Majerle also finished first in the NBA in three-point field goals made and attempted, and scored 18 points in the [[1993 NBA All-Star Game]]. The Suns entered the playoffs as the number 1 seed in the Western Conference, and would defeat the Lakers, the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] to reach the [[1993 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] with Majerle averaging 15 points in the playoffs and posting big games such as a 34-point performance in the 5th game against Seattle. In the Finals, the Suns faced the defending champion [[Chicago Bulls]] led by [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Scottie Pippen]], and despite having home court advantage the Suns could not beat the 2-time champions who won in 6 games to win 3 championships in a row. Majerle performed well in the Suns win in game 3, scoring 28 points in the crucial win in Chicago.\n\n====Last years in Phoenix====\nMajerle would again lead the league in three-point field goals and attempts in the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]], as the Suns won 56 games and made the playoffs before losing to the eventual champion [[Houston Rockets]] in a 7-game semifinal series. He would then go on to play for Team USA and win in the World Championships in Canada. He would earn another selection to the All-Star game in the following season, scoring 10 points in the [[1995 NBA All-Star Game]] which was held in Phoenix. Despite this, Majerle started in 46 games, playing small forward often as the team now featured [[Wesley Person]] at shooting guard and veteran [[A. C. Green]] at forward. The Suns again lost in the semifinals to Houston in 7 games, and Majerle was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the offseason.\n\n===Cleveland Cavaliers (1995\u20131996)===\nIn Cleveland, Majerle was used as a reserve at small forward, starting in 15 of the 82 games behind [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]] and averaging 10.6 points a game. The Cavaliers won 47 games before losing to the [[New York Knicks]] in a 3-game sweep in the first round, with Majerle increasing his scoring to 16.7 (second on the team) during the series. In the offseason the Cavaliers released Majerle, and he would go on to sign with the [[Miami Heat]].\n\n===Miami Heat (1996\u20132001)===\nThe Heat were a team with a bright future, as they featured all-stars [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Tim Hardaway]], and were coached by [[Pat Riley]]. Injuries limited Majerle to 36 games during the [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], as the Heat managed to win a franchise best 61 games and the Atlantic Division. During the regular season, on December 7, 1996, against the Chicago Bulls, Majerle made a three-pointer with one second remaining to win the game 83\u201380 and snap the Bulls' NBA record 44 home-game winning streak.<ref>[http://stats.nba.com/gameDetail.html?GameID=0029600261&tabView=playbyplay Miami Heat at Chicago Bulls, December 7, 1996 - Official Play-by-Play]</ref> In the playoffs, the veteran Majerle was in healthy shape, and the Heat beat the up-and-coming [[Orlando Magic]] in the first round before facing the Knicks in a grueling 7 game series in which Majerle scored 18 points in the sixth game. The Heat would eventually fall to the defending champion Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals in 5 games.\n\nMajerle would again play as the team's backup small forward in the [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]], averaging 7 points a game as one of the team's main three-point threats, and Miami would post another winning season before losing to New York in the first round of the playoffs. The [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]] would be shortened to 50 games as a result of a league lockout, and with teammate [[Voshon Lenard]] hurt for much of the season, Majerle stepped in to start in 48 games. Miami won another Atlantic Division title, but again lost to New York in 5 games in the first round.\n\nThe team continued to use Majerle as a starter during the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]], as he started in 69 of 82 games and again averaged 7 points during the season. In the playoffs, Miami defeated the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the first round before facing the Knicks in another 7 game series in which New York again prevailed. Majerle averaged 9 points in the playoffs and led the team with 20 three-point field goals. In the 2000 offseason it was revealed that Alonzo Mourning would not play as a result of a kidney disease, and the [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301 season]] would feature new acquisitions such as [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]], and Majerle would serve as a reserve. The Heat would lose in the first round of the playoffs in a sweep to the [[Charlotte Hornets]], and in the offseason Majerle would sign a deal returning to his original team in Phoenix.\n\n===Return to Phoenix (2001\u20132002)===\nIn his return to the Suns, Majerle received much praise and applause from the hometown Suns fans, playing in 65 games and leading the team in three-point field goals made with 79. His NBA career finished on April 17, 2002, when he officially retired as a member of his original team.\n\n== NBA career statistics ==\n{{NBA player statistics legend}}\n\n=== Regular season

nickname \"'''Thunder Dan'''\", is an American retired professional [[basketball]] player and former coach of the [[Grand Canyon Antelopes]]. He played 14 years in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) with the [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Miami Heat]], and [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. He won a bronze medal with the [[1988 United States men's Olympic basketball team|U.S. national team]] at the [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], and a gold medal at the [[1994 FIBA World Championship]].<ref>[http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_1994.html 1994 USA Basketball] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126102608/http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_1994.html |date=November 26, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nBorn and raised in [[Traverse City, Michigan]], Majerle starred for [[Central High School (Traverse City)|Traverse City High School]] (now Central) and [[Central Michigan Chippewas men's basketball|Central Michigan University]] in [[Mount Pleasant, Michigan|Mount Pleasant]],<ref name=ruggd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vVpWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=te8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7041%2C10560363 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=''(Knight-Ridder)'' |last=Longman |first=Jere |title=Rugged Majerle making a name |date=August 31, 1988 |page=D2}}</ref> where he played for four years with averages of 21.8 points and 8.9 rebounds a game. He held the school season record for points until [[Marcus Keene]] broke the mark in the [[2016-17 Central Michigan Chippewas men's basketball team|2016-17 season]].\n\nMajerle's great-grandfather Frank Majerle Sr. emigrated to the United States in 1901 at age 20 from what is now [[Slovenia]], but was then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. Frank Sr. settled in [[Haring, Michigan]], and married American-born Anna Suhorepec (anglicised to Suhropetz) whose parents were also from [[Yugoslavia]], more specifically Slovenia.\n\n==NBA career==\n\n===Phoenix Suns (1988\u20131995)===\nThe Suns selected Majerle with the 14th pick of the [[1988 NBA draft]], which the Suns acquired (along with [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]]) in a trade from the Cleveland Cavaliers for [[Larry Nance]]. During the draft, he was promptly booed when his name was announced over the public address system. Suns coach [[Cotton Fitzsimmons]] publicly chastised the Suns fans and told them \"you'll be sorry you ever booed this young man\". In his rookie season Majerle only played in 54 games and started in 5, averaging 8.6 points as a bench player. The Suns would win 55 games and make the playoffs, and Majerle increased his scoring average to 14.3 points a game as Phoenix advanced all the way to the Western Conference Finals before losing to the defending champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]].\n\nThe young Majerle would continue to be used as a backup for the next two seasons, and would become popular for his impressive jumping ability and \"thunderous\" [[slam dunk]] that would lead to his nickname \"Thunder Dan\". During the [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390 season]], he would start in 23 games, increasing his scoring average to 11 points a game as the Suns again advanced to the Western Conference Finals where this time they were eliminated by the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. Despite another successful season for Majerle and the Suns in the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]], they would fall in the first round of the playoffs to the [[Utah Jazz]]. Majerle had become an effective three-point shooter and defensive specialist, and would be named to the 1990\u201391 NBA All-Defensive Second team at the conclusion of the season.\n\nThe 1992 season would feature more improvement for Majerle, who had become an even more effective three-point shooter and defensive specialist. Despite starting in just 15 of the 82 games he played in, Majerle was selected to play in the [[1992 NBA All-Star Game]]. The Suns again made the playoffs, but lost in the conference semifinals to Portland. In the offseason, Phoenix managed to pull off a major step towards an NBA Title, as they acquired superstar forward [[Charles Barkley]] in a trade with the [[Philadelphia 76ers]].\n\n====1993: Trip to the Finals====\nThe Suns had improved significantly with the addition of Barkley, while the trade itself which featured the departure of guard [[Jeff Hornacek]] meant that Majerle would now serve as the team's starting shooting guard. The result would be a 62-win season for Phoenix, with Barkley winning the Most Valuable Player Award and Majerle finishing second on the team in scoring while being named to his second NBA All-Defensive Second Team. Majerle also finished first in the NBA in three-point field goals made and attempted, and scored 18 points in the [[1993 NBA All-Star Game]]. The Suns entered the playoffs as the number 1 seed in the Western Conference, and would defeat the Lakers, the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] to reach the [[1993 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] with Majerle averaging 15 points in the playoffs and posting big games such as a 34-point performance in the 5th game against Seattle. In the Finals, the Suns faced the defending champion [[Chicago Bulls]] led by [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Scottie Pippen]], and despite having home court advantage the Suns could not beat the 2-time champions who won in 6 games to win 3 championships in a row. Majerle performed well in the Suns win in game 3, scoring 28 points in the crucial win in Chicago.\n\n====Last years in Phoenix====\nMajerle would again lead the league in three-point field goals and attempts in the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]], as the Suns won 56 games and made the playoffs before losing to the eventual champion [[Houston Rockets]] in a 7-game semifinal series. He would then go on to play for Team USA and win in the World Championships in Canada. He would earn another selection to the All-Star game in the following season, scoring 10 points in the [[1995 NBA All-Star Game]] which was held in Phoenix. Despite this, Majerle started in 46 games, playing small forward often as the team now featured [[Wesley Person]] at shooting guard and veteran [[A. C. Green]] at forward. The Suns again lost in the semifinals to Houston in 7 games, and Majerle was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the offseason.\n\n===Cleveland Cavaliers (1995\u20131996)===\nIn Cleveland, Majerle was used as a reserve at small forward, starting in 15 of the 82 games behind [[Chris Mills (basketball)|Chris Mills]] and averaging 10.6 points a game. The Cavaliers won 47 games before losing to the [[New York Knicks]] in a 3-game sweep in the first round, with Majerle increasing his scoring to 16.7 (second on the team) during the series. In the offseason the Cavaliers released Majerle, and he would go on to sign with the [[Miami Heat]].\n\n===Miami Heat (1996\u20132001)===\nThe Heat were a team with a bright future, as they featured all-stars [[Alonzo Mourning]] and [[Tim Hardaway]], and were coached by [[Pat Riley]]. Injuries limited Majerle to 36 games during the [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]], as the Heat managed to win a franchise best 61 games and the Atlantic Division. During the regular season, on December 7, 1996, against the Chicago Bulls, Majerle made a three-pointer with one second remaining to win the game 83\u201380 and snap the Bulls' NBA record 44 home-game winning streak.<ref>[http://stats.nba.com/gameDetail.html?GameID=0029600261&tabView=playbyplay Miami Heat at Chicago Bulls, December 7, 1996 - Official Play-by-Play]</ref> In the playoffs, the veteran Majerle was in healthy shape, and the Heat beat the up-and-coming [[Orlando Magic]] in the first round before facing the Knicks in a grueling 7 game series in which Majerle scored 18 points in the sixth game. The Heat would eventually fall to the defending champion Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals in 5 games.\n\nMajerle would again play as the team's backup small forward in the [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]], averaging 7 points a game as one of the team's main three-point threats, and Miami would post another winning season before losing to New York in the first round of the playoffs. The [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]] would be shortened to 50 games as a result of a league lockout, and with teammate [[Voshon Lenard]] hurt for much of the season, Majerle stepped in to start in 48 games. Miami won another Atlantic Division title, but again lost to New York in 5 games in the first round.\n\nThe team continued to use Majerle as a starter during the [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000 season]], as he started in 69 of 82 games and again averaged 7 points during the season. In the playoffs, Miami defeated the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the first round before facing the Knicks in another 7 game series in which New York again prevailed. Majerle averaged 9 points in the playoffs and led the team with 20 three-point field goals. In the 2000 offseason it was revealed that Alonzo Mourning would not play as a result of a kidney disease, and the [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301 season]] would feature new acquisitions such as [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]], and Majerle would serve as a reserve. The Heat would lose in the first round of the playoffs in a sweep to the [[Charlotte Hornets]], and in the offseason Majerle would sign a deal returning to his original team in Phoenix.\n\n===Return to Phoenix (2001\u20132002)===\nIn his return to the Suns, Majerle received much praise and applause from the hometown Suns fans, playing in 65 games and leading the team in three-point field goals made with 79. His NBA career finished on April 17, 2002, when he officially retired as a member of his original team.\n\n== NBA career statistics ==\n{{NBA player statistics legend}}\n\n=== Regular season

{"title_page": "Christopher Whelen", "text_new": "'''Christopher Whelen''' (17 April 1927 \u2013 18 September 1993) was an English composer, conductor and playwright, best known for his radio and [[List of television operas|television operas]]. Because much of his work was written directly for broadcast little of it survives today.\n\n==Life==\nWhelen was born in London and christened at [[St Martin in the Fields]]. He was bought up by his mother Winifred, a violinist, with help from his Godmother Mary Gotch, also a musician. He became a chorister at [[New College Oxford]], attended [[Worksop College]] (studying piano and cello) and then at the Birmingham and Midland School of Music (now the [[Royal Birmingham Conservatoire]]) between 1944 and 1946 for clarinet and composition.<ref name=jan>'Composer & Conductor Christopher Whelen' posted by ''Janice in Caunes''</ref> After two years with the [[RAF]] for his National Service Whelen secured conducting lessons with the Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 [[Rudolf Schwarz (conductor)|Rudolf Schwarz]].<ref name=grove>[https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-5000002933?rskey=IuTaiD Palmer, Christopher. 'Whelen, Christopher' in Grove Music Online]</ref> becoming assistant conductor at the [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra|Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra]] under Schwarz.\n\nAlready interested in [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] culture (particularly [[Yeats]]), the music of [[Arnold Bax]] became a central influence for Whelen after hearing a performance of [[Tintagel (Bax)|Tintagel]].<ref>Foreman, Lewis. ''Bax: A Composer and His Times'' (1983)</ref> A correspondence began in 1947, which led to a close friendship until Bax's death in 1953. Around 40 of the letters have been published. In 1951 Whelen conducted Bax's Sixth Symphony in Bournemouth. Bax wrote: \"I still dote on your performance of No 6 and want a repeat\".<ref name=tempo>Scott-Sutherland, Colin. 'Review, Cuchulan Among the Guns' in ''Tempo'' No 2015, January 2001, p 34-5</ref> Through Bax Whelen also met the pianist [[Harriet Cohen]], who became a supporter. He was awarded the [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]] medal for conducting in 1955.<ref name=jan/>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen met his lifelong partner Dennis Andrews in 1948 in Bournemouth They lived together for many years in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire before Whelen's death in 1993.<ref name=jan/> The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref> The action alternates between a crashed aircraft in the African jungle near [[Benguela]] and the radio control room at [[Kakonda]] Airfield. Jeremy Rundall in ''The Sunday Times'' said it \"has an Ancient Mariner-ish ring, and should be heard again\".<ref>''Sunday Times'', 12 December 1965, p 40</ref>\n\nThe specifically commissioned television opera ''Some Place of Darkness'' used an original libretto by the experienced television writer [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. The BBC insisted on realism, and the result was \" a sombre domestic drama set in the present, it exemplified all that television promoted\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6fwSLslWOjsC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=%22Some+place+of+darkness%22+%22television+opera%22&source=bl&ots=b_k28mFrbb&sig=ACfU3U2uiIHxXAQHFjddkSSblEjGXMLm6g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwji-7CJovfoAhUNQRUIHeqrACcQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Some%20place%20of%20darkness%22%20%22television%20opera%22&f=false Barnes, Jennifer.

The piece, he said \"was the result of a BBC edict - crisp and clear - 'contemporary plot and modern dress'. The words smacked like a damp cloth on the operatic table.\"<ref>Whelen, Christopher. 'Thoughts on Television Opera' in ''Composer'' 24 (1967), p 17</ref>\n\nBy 1969 for ''Incident at Owl Creek'' Whelen had dispensed with a librettist, adapting the source material (based on the short story by [[Ambrose Bierce]]) himself. This led to him writing a text based on an original idea for ''The Findings'' (1972), concerning the excavation of an [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan]] tomb.<ref>[[Rodney Milnes|Milnes, Rodney]]: \u2018The Findings\u2019 in ''Opera'' 23 (1972), p 945\u20138</ref> Creating his own plot and characters presented through his own words and music, Whelen was attempting to create a more personal form of \"total musical theatre\".<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e648c51cd2774f2083924651d29f021c ''Radio Times'', Issue 2540, 13 July 1972 p 20]</ref> Christopher Palmer identified ''The Findings'' and ''Incident at Owl Creek'' as \"outstanding\".<ref name=grove/> The music drama ''The Restorer'', produced and directed by [[Martin Esslin]], is an example of Whelen's experimentation with the close combination of words and music.

He was bought up by his mother Winifred, a violinist, with help from his Godmother Mary Gotch, also a musician. He became a chorister at [[New College Oxford]], attended [[Worksop College]] (studying piano and cello) and then at the Birmingham and Midland School of Music (now the [[Royal Birmingham Conservatoire]]) between 1944 and 1946 for clarinet and composition.<ref name=jan>'Composer & Conductor Christopher Whelen' posted by ''Janice in Caunes''</ref> After two years with the [[RAF]] for his National Service Whelen secured conducting lessons with the Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 [[Rudolf Schwarz (conductor)|Rudolf Schwarz]].<ref name=grove>[https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-5000002933?rskey=IuTaiD Palmer, Christopher.

''Bax: A Composer and His Times'' (1983)</ref> A correspondence began in 1947, which led to a close friendship until Bax's death in 1953. Around 40 of the letters have been published. In 1951 Whelen conducted Bax's Sixth Symphony in Bournemouth. Bax wrote: \"I still dote on your performance of No 6 and want a repeat\".<ref name=tempo>Scott-Sutherland, Colin. 'Review, Cuchulan Among the Guns' in ''Tempo'' No 2015, January 2001, p 34-5</ref> Through Bax Whelen also met the pianist [[Harriet Cohen]], who became a supporter. He was awarded the [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]] medal for conducting in 1955.<ref name=jan/>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen met his lifelong partner Dennis Andrews in 1948 in Bournemouth They lived together for many years in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire before Whelen's death in 1993.<ref name=jan/> The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref> The action alternates between a crashed aircraft in the African jungle near [[Benguela]] and the radio control room at [[Kakonda]] Airfield.

After a collegiate career with [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]], he played with several teams in his 14-season [[National Basketball Association]] career, including the [[Miami Heat]], the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and the [[San Antonio Spurs]], but is perhaps best known for his five-year stint with the [[Atlanta Hawks]] which included an [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] appearance in 1998. He won a [[NBA Finals|championship]] with the Spurs in 2003.\nSmith was widely regarded as an excellent three-point shooter, and is one of three players to make seven 3-pointers in a quarter.\n\nHe joined the [[USA men's national basketball team]] in the [[1994 FIBA World Championship]] <ref>[http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_1994.html 1994 USA Basketball] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126102608/http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_1994.html |date=November 26, 2007 }}</ref> winning the gold medal. He won another gold medal at the [[1999 Tournament of the Americas]] and an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[gold medal]] with the USA men's national basketball team at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] with [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|eleven other NBA All-Stars]].\n\n==College career==\nSmith finished his four-year career as the all-time leading scorer in Michigan State history, with 2,263 points. He ranks fourth on the school's all-time assists list (with 453) and fifth in rebounds (with 704). For his college career Smith averaged 18.5 points, 6.1 rebounds and 3.7 assists per contest in 122 games. He was named a First Team All-American as both a junior and a senior. Smith led the Spartans to a Big Ten Championship and Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1990 and hit a game-winning, last-second three-pointer to beat Wisconsin\u2013Green Bay in the first round of the 1991 NCAA Tournament. He was inducted into Michigan State's Athletics Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\n==NBA career==\n\n===Miami Heat===\nSmith was selected fifth overall in the [[1991 NBA draft]] by the Miami Heat, a young expansion team which featured other young players such as [[Glen Rice]], [[Rony Seikaly]] and [[Brian Shaw]]. Smith played in 61 games in his rookie season, starting in 59 with averages of 12 points a game and 4.6 assists. The young team made the playoffs to face the top seeded defending champion [[Chicago Bulls]], who swept the Heat in 3 games in the first round.  Smith averaged 16 points a game for the series. Injuries limited Smith 48 games in the 1992\u201393 season, but he increased his scoring average to 16 points a game. Miami did not make the playoffs that year.\n\nThe 1993\u201394 season would prove to be Smith's best in Miami, as he averaged 17.3 points a game with 5.1 assists as the Heat won 42 games and entered the first round of the playoffs against the [[Atlanta Hawks]]. The series went to 5 games, as Miami won its first playoff games in franchise history.  Smith led the team in scoring during the series with 19.2 points and shot 40 percent from beyond the three-point line. Smith would play just two games to start the 1994\u201395 season before being traded along with [[Grant Long]] to Atlanta for [[Kevin Willis]], a deal that was universally regarded as a one-sided heist by Atlanta, and that eventually led the Heat to hire [[Pat Riley]] as their coach and VP of Basketball Operations.\n\n===Atlanta Hawks===\nSmith started in 59 of 78 games for Atlanta and averaged 16 points during the regular season and 19 points in the playoffs, as the Hawks lost in a first round sweep to the [[Indiana Pacers]]. He would go on to average a then career-high 18.1 points a game in 80 starts in the 1995\u201396 season, forming a formidable backcourt one-two punch with [[Mookie Blaylock]]. The team under head coach [[Lenny Wilkens]] would win 46 games and defeat Indiana in the first round in 5 games before falling to the [[Orlando Magic]] in the conference semifinals in 6 games.  Smith averaged 21.7 points in 10 playoff games, including a 35-point performance in a game 4 win against the Magic.\n\nThe following season would feature another career high scoring average (20.1) for Smith, as he continued to serve as the Hawks' main option on offense.  The team also featured players such as [[Christian Laettner]] and [[Dikembe Mutombo]], and would go on to win 56 games before meeting and defeating the [[Detroit Pistons]] in a 5-game first round series. Smith played well against Detroit and held his own against [[Michael Jordan]] and the defending champion [[Chicago Bulls]], who defeated the Hawks in 5 games in the semifinals.  The following season would be similar to Smith as he once again averaged 20.1 points a game, but this time managed to be named an NBA All-Star as he scored 14 points in 16 minutes of action in the [[1998 NBA All-Star Game]]. The Hawks would disappoint in the playoffs yet again however, this time losing to the [[Charlotte Hornets]] 3 games to 1 in the conference semifinals despite a 24.8 ppg scoring average by Smith for the series.\n\n[[Image:Steve Smith hawks jersey.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Smith enjoyed some of the most productive seasons of his career while wearing an Atlanta Hawks uniform.]]\n\nThe 1998\u201399 season would be limited to 50 games as a result of a league wide lockout, and in 36 games Smith averaged 18.7 points a game and led the Hawks to another 5 game first round victory over Detroit.  The Hawks had no answer, however, for the [[New York Knicks]], and again the Hawks were eliminated in the semifinals. Smith averaged 17.3 points a game in the 1999 playoffs. In the offseason, the Hawks traded Smith in a 4 player trade to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] which included [[Isaiah Rider]], who had served as Portland's starting shooting guard and who Smith would now replace.\n\n===Portland Trail Blazers===\nPortland was a loaded team that had reached the Western Conference Finals in the 1999 playoffs and featured star forward [[Rasheed Wallace]] as well as the newly acquired [[Scottie Pippen]]. Smith would no longer be required to carry the offensive load, and averaged 14.9 points a game in 81 starts as the Trail Blazers secured the second best record in the Western Conference. Smith would increase his scoring average to 17.1 in the playoffs, as Portland would defeat the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in the first round before beating the [[Utah Jazz]] in the semifinals. Up next would be the league best [[Los Angeles Lakers]], who took a 3\u20131 series lead over Portland before the Trail Blazers won game 5 on the road and game 6 at home as Smith scored 26 points to set up a game 7 matchup. Despite leading by double digits heading into the fourth quarter, the Lakers came back to win the game and advance to the NBA Finals where they would win the NBA Title.\n\nThat summer, Smith represented the United States at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] for the [[United States men's national basketball team]], which won the gold medal. He averaged just over 6 points a game in the Olympics including a 12-point performance against China in the group stage of the tournament.\n\nThe Trail Blazers entered the 2000\u201301 season with high expectations, but struggled to repeat the success of the previous season, as injuries took their toll and new additions and trades hurt team chemistry.  Smith only started in 36 of 81 games, but still managed to 13.6 points a game. Portland would suffer another loss to the Lakers in the playoffs, this time in a three-game sweep in the first round.  Following the season he would be traded to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for [[Derek Anderson (basketball)|Derek Anderson]] and [[Steve Kerr]].\n\n===San Antonio Spurs===\nThe Spurs featured superstars [[Tim Duncan]] and [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]], and were attempting to win another championship as they had in 1999. Smith would be utilized as the team's starting shooting guard, averaging 11.6 points a game in 76 starts while leading in the league in three-point shooting at 47 percent for the season.  Smith would average double figure scoring in the Spurs' first round win over the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], including 17 points in a game 1 victory, but struggled against the defending champion L.A. Lakers, who defeated the Spurs in 5 games.\n\nThe following 2002\u201303 season would mark Smith's final year in San Antonio, while second-year [[point guard]] [[Tony Parker]] blossomed into the team's second leading scorer.  The same was the case for guard [[Stephen Jackson]] who consequently came to serve as the team's main starting shooting guard, with Smith starting in just 18 games for the season as a result of injuries limiting him to just 58 total games. As a result, Smith averaged 6.8 points a game, and would be used sparingly in the Spurs' playoff run, in which the team eliminated the [[Phoenix Suns]], the three-time champion Lakers and the [[Dallas Mavericks]] before defeating the [[New Jersey Nets]] in six games to win the NBA title, Smith's first and only championship. Just before the 2003\u20132004 season started, the free agent Smith signed with the [[New Orleans Hornets]].\n\n===New Orleans Hornets===\nSmith played in 71 games for the Hornets, who were led by [[Baron Davis]] and [[Jamaal Magloire]]. He averaged 5 points a game and shot 40 percent from beyond the three-point arc.  The Hornets made the playoffs but lost in a grueling back and forth series against Miami. Despite losing the final 7th game in Miami, Smith scored 25 points, including 5 three-pointers, against his former team. Once again a free agent before the following season, Smith signed with the [[Charlotte Bobcats]].\n\n===Charlotte Bobcats, Return to Miami===\nSmith played in 37 games for the young Bobcats team, and averaged 7.9 points a game, including hitting the franchise's first three-point field goal. At midseason he was traded to Miami for [[Malik Allen]]. He would be used sparingly by the Heat, including in their playoff run which concluded with a loss in the conference finals to the defending champion [[Detroit Pistons]]. Following the season Smith announced his retirement.\n\n==NBA career statistics==\n{{NBA player statistics legend|champion=y|leader=y}}\n\n=== Regular season ===\n{{NBA player statistics

For the 2008 season, Smith took a position at [[NBA TV]], and was replaced for Hawks broadcasts by [[Dominique Wilkins]]. During the [[2011 NBA All-Star Weekend]], he was a member of the Atlanta team that won the [[NBA All-Star Weekend Shooting Stars Competition|Shooting Stars Competition]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NBA All-Star Shooting Stars Winners|date=August 24, 2017|website=NBA.com|url=http://www.nba.com/history/all-star/shooting-stars#/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224155543/http://www.nba.com/history/all-star/shooting-stars|archive-date=February 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Charitable work==\nSmith is well known for his charitable pursuits, including a US$2.5 million gift in 1997 to his [[alma mater]], [[Michigan State University]], where he was a star guard under coach [[Jud Heathcote]]. Smith's donation helped to fund the Clara Bell Smith Student Athlete Academic Center, which is named for his mother. This was the largest single donation by a professional athlete to his former school in history.<ref>[http://www.msuspartans.com/facilities/smith-center.html Smith Academic Center]</ref>\n\nSmith insisted that part of his $2.5 million donation be dedicated to create the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110318103924/http://www.stevesmithcharitablefund.org/stevesmith-msu-scholarship.htm Steve Smith Scholarship for Academic Achievement].  In 2001, Smith donated another $600,000 to fully endow the scholarship, which provides a four-year academic scholarship to one student per year from Smith's former high school.\n\nIn recognition for his generosity, during the [[1997\u201398 NBA season]], Smith received the [[J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award]], and in [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302]] received the [[Joe Dumars]] [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]].\n\n==Personal life==\nSmith first met his wife, Millie, at a charity tennis tournament in Detroit. They had a long-distance relationship for more than a year before getting married in 1996.<ref>[http://www.southernseasons.net/hol11coverstory.html There's a lot more to Millie Smith than meets the eye!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627095403/http://www.southernseasons.net/hol11coverstory.html |date=2015-06-27 }}</ref> The couple have two sons, Brayden and Davis, and Smith often coaches them in soccer and basketball.

After a collegiate career with [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]], he played with several teams in his 14-season [[National Basketball Association]] career, including the [[Miami Heat]], the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and the [[San Antonio Spurs]], but is perhaps best known for his five-year stint with the [[Atlanta Hawks]] which included an [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] appearance in 1998. He won a [[NBA Finals|championship]] with the Spurs in 2003.\nSmith was widely regarded as an excellent three-point shooter, and is one of three players to make seven 3-pointers in a quarter.\n\nHe joined the [[USA men's national basketball team]] in the [[1994 FIBA World Championship]] <ref>[http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_1994.html 1994 USA Basketball] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126102608/http://www.usabasketball.com/history/mwc_1994.html |date=November 26, 2007 }}</ref> winning the gold medal. He won another gold medal at the [[1999 Tournament of the Americas]] and an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[gold medal]] with the USA men's national basketball team at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] with [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|eleven other NBA All-Stars]].\n\n==College career==\nSmith finished his four-year career as the all-time leading scorer in Michigan State history, with 2,263 points. He ranks fourth on the school's all-time assists list (with 453) and fifth in rebounds (with 704). For his college career Smith averaged 18.5 points, 6.1 rebounds and 3.7 assists per contest in 122 games. He was named a First Team All-American as both a junior and a senior. Smith led the Spartans to a Big Ten Championship and Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1990 and hit a game-winning, last-second three-pointer to beat Wisconsin\u2013Green Bay in the first round of the 1991 NCAA Tournament. He was inducted into Michigan State's Athletics Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\n==NBA career==\n\n===Miami Heat===\nSmith was selected fifth overall in the [[1991 NBA draft]] by the Miami Heat, a young expansion team which featured other young players such as [[Glen Rice]], [[Rony Seikaly]] and [[Brian Shaw]]. Smith played in 61 games in his rookie season, starting in 59 with averages of 12 points a game and 4.6 assists. The young team made the playoffs to face the top seeded defending champion [[Chicago Bulls]], who swept the Heat in 3 games in the first round.  Smith averaged 16 points a game for the series. Injuries limited Smith 48 games in the 1992\u201393 season, but he increased his scoring average to 16 points a game. Miami did not make the playoffs that year.\n\nThe 1993\u201394 season would prove to be Smith's best in Miami, as he averaged 17.3 points a game with 5.1 assists as the Heat won 42 games and entered the first round of the playoffs against the [[Atlanta Hawks]]. The series went to 5 games, as Miami won its first playoff games in franchise history.  Smith led the team in scoring during the series with 19.2 points and shot 40 percent from beyond the three-point line. Smith would play just two games to start the 1994\u201395 season before being traded along with [[Grant Long]] to Atlanta for [[Kevin Willis]], a deal that was universally regarded as a one-sided heist by Atlanta, and that eventually led the Heat to hire [[Pat Riley]] as their coach and VP of Basketball Operations.\n\n===Atlanta Hawks===\nSmith started in 59 of 78 games for Atlanta and averaged 16 points during the regular season and 19 points in the playoffs, as the Hawks lost in a first round sweep to the [[Indiana Pacers]]. He would go on to average a then career-high 18.1 points a game in 80 starts in the 1995\u201396 season, forming a formidable backcourt one-two punch with [[Mookie Blaylock]]. The team under head coach [[Lenny Wilkens]] would win 46 games and defeat Indiana in the first round in 5 games before falling to the [[Orlando Magic]] in the conference semifinals in 6 games.  Smith averaged 21.7 points in 10 playoff games, including a 35-point performance in a game 4 win against the Magic.\n\nThe following season would feature another career high scoring average (20.1) for Smith, as he continued to serve as the Hawks' main option on offense.  The team also featured players such as [[Christian Laettner]] and [[Dikembe Mutombo]], and would go on to win 56 games before meeting and defeating the [[Detroit Pistons]] in a 5-game first round series. Smith played well against Detroit and held his own against [[Michael Jordan]] and the defending champion [[Chicago Bulls]], who defeated the Hawks in 5 games in the semifinals.  The following season would be similar to Smith as he once again averaged 20.1 points a game, but this time managed to be named an NBA All-Star as he scored 14 points in 16 minutes of action in the [[1998 NBA All-Star Game]]. The Hawks would disappoint in the playoffs yet again however, this time losing to the [[Charlotte Hornets]] 3 games to 1 in the conference semifinals despite a 24.8 ppg scoring average by Smith for the series.\n\n[[Image:Steve Smith hawks jersey.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Smith enjoyed some of the most productive seasons of his career while wearing an Atlanta Hawks uniform.]]\n\nThe 1998\u201399 season would be limited to 50 games as a result of a league wide lockout, and in 36 games Smith averaged 18.7 points a game and led the Hawks to another 5 game first round victory over Detroit.  The Hawks had no answer, however, for the [[New York Knicks]], and again the Hawks were eliminated in the semifinals. Smith averaged 17.3 points a game in the 1999 playoffs. In the offseason, the Hawks traded Smith in a 4 player trade to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] which included [[Isaiah Rider]], who had served as Portland's starting shooting guard and who Smith would now replace.\n\n===Portland Trail Blazers===\nPortland was a loaded team that had reached the Western Conference Finals in the 1999 playoffs and featured star forward [[Rasheed Wallace]] as well as the newly acquired [[Scottie Pippen]]. Smith would no longer be required to carry the offensive load, and averaged 14.9 points a game in 81 starts as the Trail Blazers secured the second best record in the Western Conference. Smith would increase his scoring average to 17.1 in the playoffs, as Portland would defeat the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in the first round before beating the [[Utah Jazz]] in the semifinals. Up next would be the league best [[Los Angeles Lakers]], who took a 3\u20131 series lead over Portland before the Trail Blazers won game 5 on the road and game 6 at home as Smith scored 26 points to set up a game 7 matchup. Despite leading by double digits heading into the fourth quarter, the Lakers came back to win the game and advance to the NBA Finals where they would win the NBA Title.\n\nThat summer, Smith represented the United States at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] for the [[United States men's national basketball team]], which won the gold medal. He averaged just over 6 points a game in the Olympics including a 12-point performance against China in the group stage of the tournament.\n\nThe Trail Blazers entered the 2000\u201301 season with high expectations, but struggled to repeat the success of the previous season, as injuries took their toll and new additions and trades hurt team chemistry.  Smith only started in 36 of 81 games, but still managed to 13.6 points a game. Portland would suffer another loss to the Lakers in the playoffs, this time in a three-game sweep in the first round.  Following the season he would be traded to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for [[Derek Anderson (basketball)|Derek Anderson]] and [[Steve Kerr]].\n\n===San Antonio Spurs===\nThe Spurs featured superstars [[Tim Duncan]] and [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]], and were attempting to win another championship as they had in 1999. Smith would be utilized as the team's starting shooting guard, averaging 11.6 points a game in 76 starts while leading in the league in three-point shooting at 47 percent for the season.  Smith would average double figure scoring in the Spurs' first round win over the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], including 17 points in a game 1 victory, but struggled against the defending champion L.A. Lakers, who defeated the Spurs in 5 games.\n\nThe following 2002\u201303 season would mark Smith's final year in San Antonio, while second-year [[point guard]] [[Tony Parker]] blossomed into the team's second leading scorer.  The same was the case for guard [[Stephen Jackson]] who consequently came to serve as the team's main starting shooting guard, with Smith starting in just 18 games for the season as a result of injuries limiting him to just 58 total games. As a result, Smith averaged 6.8 points a game, and would be used sparingly in the Spurs' playoff run, in which the team eliminated the [[Phoenix Suns]], the three-time champion Lakers and the [[Dallas Mavericks]] before defeating the [[New Jersey Nets]] in six games to win the NBA title, Smith's first and only championship. Just before the 2003\u20132004 season started, the free agent Smith signed with the [[New Orleans Hornets]].\n\n===New Orleans Hornets===\nSmith played in 71 games for the Hornets, who were led by [[Baron Davis]] and [[Jamaal Magloire]]. He averaged 5 points a game and shot 40 percent from beyond the three-point arc.  The Hornets made the playoffs but lost in a grueling back and forth series against Miami. Despite losing the final 7th game in Miami, Smith scored 25 points, including 5 three-pointers, against his former team. Once again a free agent before the following season, Smith signed with the [[Charlotte Bobcats]].\n\n===Charlotte Bobcats, Return to Miami===\nSmith played in 37 games for the young Bobcats team, and averaged 7.9 points a game, including hitting the franchise's first three-point field goal. At midseason he was traded to Miami for [[Malik Allen]]. He would be used sparingly by the Heat, including in their playoff run which concluded with a loss in the conference finals to the defending champion [[Detroit Pistons]]. Following the season Smith announced his retirement.\n\n==NBA career statistics==\n{{NBA player statistics legend|champion=y|leader=y}}\n\n=== Regular season ===\n{{NBA player statistics

The 509th CG had a single mission: to drop the [[atomic bomb]].  The group made history on 6 August 1945, when the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] \"[[Enola Gay]],\" piloted by Col. [[Paul Tibbets|Paul W. Tibbets Jr.]], dropped [[Little Boy|the first atomic bomb]] on [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]. The B-29 \"[[Bockscar]],\" piloted by Maj. [[Charles Sweeney]], flew over the Japanese mainland on 9 August 1945 and dropped [[Fat Man|the second atomic bomb]] on [[Nagasaki]].<ref name=509BWbio />\n\n===Cold War===\n\nThe wing was established as '''509th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy''' on 3 November 1947 and organized on 17 November 1947.<ref name=509BWbio /> The initial mission of the 509th Bomb Wing was to carry out strategic bombing missions using Atomic Bombs at the direction of the [[President of the United States]].\n\nThe wing's mission expanded in July 1948 when it received the [[509th Air Refueling Squadron]] and its KB-29M hose-type tankers and later with B/KB\u201329P boom\u2013type tankers.  Although aerial refueling had been accomplished as far back as the 1920s, the Air Force decided to make it a permanent part of its operations. In fact, the 509th AREFS was one of the first two AREFSs ever activated. In the first week of December 1948, the squadron began receiving the KB-29M, modified B-29 bombers capable of providing air-to-air refueling for bombers using a refueling hose [vs. today's USAF standard flying boom]. With the addition of tankers, the 509th's bombers could reach nearly any point on earth. In June 1950, the wing received the [[B-50D Superfortress]] and in January 1954, the [[KC-97 Stratotanker]] replaced the aging KB-29Ms.<ref name=509BWbio />\n\nThe 509th BW entered the jet age in June 1955 when it received the [[B-47E Stratojet]], the first all-jet bomber.  Deployed as a wing several times in the early 1950s, three times to England on REFLEX deployments and once to [[Guam]], the wing also deployed individual squadrons at other times.  Temporarily had no refueling unit during 1958.  The 509th BW moved its personnel and equipment to [[Pease Air Force Base]], New Hampshire in August 1958.<ref name=509BWbio />\n\nBy 1961 it was believed that the B-47 was becoming obsolete and President John F. Kennedy directed that the phaseout of the B-47 be accelerated. However this was delayed in July by the onset of the Berlin crisis of 1961\u201362.\nThere, the wing continued to function as an integral part of [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC). By 1965, its [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|B-47s]] were scheduled for retirement. Unfortunately, this retirement also included the 509th. Fate intervened, however, as SAC decided to keep the 509th alive and equipped it with [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]]s and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]]s.<ref name=509BWbio />\n\nThe 509th was initially phased down for inactivation in late 1965 as a part of the retirement of the B-47, but instead was converted to a [[B-52D Stratofortress]] and KC-135 in March 1966. The 509th was taken off nuclear alert as its B-52Ds were designed to carry a large number of conventional bombs (84 [[Mark 82 bomb|500-lb Mk 82]] or 42 [[M117 bomb|750 lb M-117]]s) for service in the [[Vietnam War]] as part of [[Operation Arc Light]]. The wing deployed [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] aircraft and crews, November 1966\u2013 December 1975; with B\u201352 aircraft and crews, November 1966\u2013 September 1969, and with B\u201352 crews, 1970.  From 1  April to 1 October 1968 and 26  March to c. 21 March 1968, more than one-half of the wing was deployed to [[Andersen AFB]], [[Guam]] to support SAC operations in [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name=509BWfacts/>\n\n[[File:A 509th Bombardment Wing FB-111A aircraft drops Mark 82 high drag practice bombs along a coastline during a training exercise DF-ST-91-02468.jpg|thumb|[[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|FB-111A]] dropping [[Mark 82]] practice bombs during a training mission over [[Nomans Land (Massachusetts)|Nomans Land]]]]\n\nOn 1 December 1969 was wing redesignated as the 509th Bombardment Wing, Medium and began receiving the [[FB-111]]A strategic bomber in December 1970.<ref name=509BWbio />   The FB-111A was the all-weather strategic bombing version of the [[Tactical Air Command]] F-111 which was equipped to carry the [[AGM-69 SRAM]] that carried a nuclear warhead with an explosive yield of 200 kilotons.  The 509th would operate the aircraft for two decades. Won the SAC Bombing and Navigation competition and the Fairchild trophy in 1979, 1981, 1982, and 1983.  Awarded the Sanders trophy for best air refueling unit in 1982.<ref name=509BWfacts/>\n\nOver the next two decades, little changed for the 509th BW as it became SAC's fighter-bomber experts. However, a [[1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission|1988 decision]] by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to close Pease created major changes for the famous 509th. Headquarters SAC decreed that the 509th would not inactivate but would transfer to [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] to become the first B-2 stealth bomber unit. As such, the wing moved to Whiteman on 30 September 1990, without people or equipment.<ref name=509BWbio />\n\nAs the Rockwell B-1B Lancer came into service, the FB-111 became redundant to SAC needs. In 1988, Pease was identified as one of several Air Force installations to be closed by 1991 as part of a [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] (BRAC) recommendation.  The 509th's FB-111s were transferred from SAC to TAC between June and December 1990, being re-designated as the F-111G and converted into a tactical bomber.\n\n===Sole Stealth bomber unit===\n[[File:509th Bomb Wing - B-2 Spirit - 2011.jpg|thumb|509th BW B-2A being prepared for Operation Odyssey Dawn<ref group=note>Aircraft is Northrop B-2A Block 10 Spirit 82-1071 \"Spirit of Mississippi\", taken 19 March 2011.</ref>]]\nIn 1988, Congressman [[Ike Skelton]] (D-MO) announced the B-2 Advanced Technology Bomber would be based at [[Whiteman AFB]], [[Missouri]].  It was also announced that the 509th Bombardment Wing would become the USAF's first B-2 Spirit active-duty wing.  Military personnel began leaving Pease in June 1990, and on 30 September 1990, the 509th was inactivated at Pease and activated at [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] as a non-operational unit the same day without aircraft, personnel or equipment.  With the reassignment the unit was redesignated as the '''509th Bombardment Wing, Heavy'''. On 1 June 1992, the Air Force disestablished the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC), transferring all bomber aircraft to the newly established [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC).  The 509th was redesignated the '''509th Bomb Wing''' on 1 September 1991, and became part of the new [[Air Combat Command]] on 1 June 1992.<ref name=509BWfacts/>\n\nIn 1993, after two years of non-operational status, the 509th became operational again.  On 1 March 1993, the wing activated the [[509th Operations Group]] as part of the 509th Bomb Wing's reorganization under the USAF Objective Wing plan. All flying squadrons, as well as an Operational Support Squadron (OSS) were assigned to the 509th OG.    The wing grew larger on 1 July 1993, when it accepted host responsibilities for Whiteman from the 351st Missile Wing.  Its 509th OG received the first operational [[B-2 Spirit]] [[stealth bomber]] on 17 December 1993 (the date was the 49th anniversary of the activation of the 509th Composite Group and the 90th of the Wright brothers' flight).<ref name=509BWbio />\n\nSince its arrival at Whiteman, the 509th underwent inspections, tests, and other challenges to insure it was ready to return as an integral part of the nation's defensive coalition.  With the B-2, the wing can bring massive firepower to bear, in a short time, anywhere on the globe through previously impenetrable defenses.  The wing has deployed elements into combat over the skies of [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]] as part of [[Operation Allied Force]] in 1999; [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] in 2001 as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], in 2003 over [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] during [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], and in 2011 over [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]] during [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aerotechnews.com/blog/2019/07/17/northrop-grumman-b-2-spirit-20-years/|accessdate=3 March 2020|title=Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit \u2013 30 years}}</ref>\n\nThe wing began to continuously deploy to Andersen AFB, Guam, in February 2005.

The unit was redesignated as the 131st Bomb Wing on 1 October 2008.\n\nThe 509th and the 131st joined forces according to what is known as a \"classic associate wing\" structure. The active-duty wing, the 509th retains full \"ownership\" of the operational assets; aircraft, maintenance facilities, etc. Each wing has its own chain-of-command and organizational structure, but the members of each unit perform their duties in a fully integrated manner.

Each symbol on the shield represents some part of the past. The Air Force wings represent the branch of service but are not in the familiar outstretched position. When the ancient Greeks approached a stranger, they raised their arms with palms outward to show they were carrying no weapons \u2013 a sign of peace. The 509th obtained special permission to display the wings in this configuration to show that it, too, comes in peace. The atomic cloud burst represents two things: that the 509th is the only unit to ever drop atomic bombs in wartime and that it still uses atomic power as a deterrent to war and defender of peace. Finally, the [[Label (heraldry)|'eldest son' symbol]] (the red 'tripod') shows that the wing is the oldest atomic trained military unit in the world.\n\n==Lineage==\n* Established as the '''509th Bombardment Wing''', Very Heavy on 3 November 1947\n: Organized on 17 November 1947\n: Redesignated: '''509th Bombardment Wing''', Medium on 1 August 1948\n: Redesignated: '''509th Bombardment Wing''', Heavy on 2 April 1966\n: Redesignated: '''509th Bombardment Wing''', Medium on 1 December 1969\n: Redesignated: '''509th Bombardment Wing''', Heavy on 30 September 1990\n: Redesignated: '''509th Bomb Wing''' on 1 September 1991<ref name=509BWfacts/>\n\n===Assignments===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Eighth Air Force]], 17 November 1947\n: Attached to [[3d Air Division]] after 1 February 1951\n* [[47th Air Division]], 10 February 1951\n: Remained attached to 3d Air Division Until 4 May 1951\n: Attached to 7th Air Division]], 4 June \u2013 2 September 1952\n: Attached to 3d Air Division, 10 July \u2013 8 October 1954\n: Attached to 7th Air Division, 26 January \u2013 30 April 1956\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[817th Air Division]], 1 July 1958\n* [[45th Air Division]], 30 June 1971\n* Eighth Air Force, 29 March 1989\n* [[100th Air Division]], 30 September 1990\n* Eighth Air Force, 26 July 1991 \u2013 present<ref name=509BWfacts/>\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===Components===\n'''Wing'''\n* [[33d Fighter Wing]]: attached 17 November 1947 \u2013 15 November 1948<ref name=509BWfacts/>\n\n'''Groups'''\n* [[33d Fighter Group]]: attached 17 November 1947 \u2013 15 November 1948\n* [[509 Bombardment Group]] (later 509th Operations Group): 17 November 1947 \u2013 16 June 1952;

The 509th CG had a single mission: to drop the [[atomic bomb]].  The group made history on 6 August 1945, when the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] \"[[Enola Gay]],\" piloted by Col. [[Paul Tibbets|Paul W. Tibbets Jr.]], dropped [[Little Boy|the first atomic bomb]] on [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]. The B-29 \"[[Bockscar]],\" piloted by Maj. [[Charles Sweeney]], flew over the Japanese mainland on 9 August 1945 and dropped [[Fat Man|the second atomic bomb]] on [[Nagasaki]].<ref name=509BWbio />\n\n===Cold War===\n\nThe wing was established as '''509th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy''' on 3 November 1947 and organized on 17 November 1947.<ref name=509BWbio /> The initial mission of the 509th Bomb Wing was to carry out strategic bombing missions using Atomic Bombs at the direction of the [[President of the United States]].\n\nThe wing's mission expanded in July 1948 when it received the [[509th Air Refueling Squadron]] and its KB-29M hose-type tankers and later with B/KB\u201329P boom\u2013type tankers.  Although aerial refueling had been accomplished as far back as the 1920s, the Air Force decided to make it a permanent part of its operations. In fact, the 509th AREFS was one of the first two AREFSs ever activated. In the first week of December 1948, the squadron began receiving the KB-29M, modified B-29 bombers capable of providing air-to-air refueling for bombers using a refueling hose [vs. today's USAF standard flying boom]. With the addition of tankers, the 509th's bombers could reach nearly any point on earth. In June 1950, the wing received the [[B-50D Superfortress]] and in January 1954, the [[KC-97 Stratotanker]] replaced the aging KB-29Ms.<ref name=509BWbio />\n\nThe 509th BW entered the jet age in June 1955 when it received the [[B-47E Stratojet]], the first all-jet bomber.  Deployed as a wing several times in the early 1950s, three times to England on REFLEX deployments and once to [[Guam]], the wing also deployed individual squadrons at other times.  Temporarily had no refueling unit during 1958.  The 509th BW moved its personnel and equipment to [[Pease Air Force Base]], New Hampshire in August 1958.<ref name=509BWbio />\n\nBy 1961 it was believed that the B-47 was becoming obsolete and President John F. Kennedy directed that the phaseout of the B-47 be accelerated. However this was delayed in July by the onset of the Berlin crisis of 1961\u201362.\nThere, the wing continued to function as an integral part of [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC). By 1965, its [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|B-47s]] were scheduled for retirement. Unfortunately, this retirement also included the 509th. Fate intervened, however, as SAC decided to keep the 509th alive and equipped it with [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]]s and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135]]s.<ref name=509BWbio />\n\nThe 509th was initially phased down for inactivation in late 1965 as a part of the retirement of the B-47, but instead was converted to a [[B-52D Stratofortress]] and KC-135 in March 1966. The 509th was taken off nuclear alert as its B-52Ds were designed to carry a large number of conventional bombs (84 [[Mark 82 bomb|500-lb Mk 82]] or 42 [[M117 bomb|750 lb M-117]]s) for service in the [[Vietnam War]] as part of [[Operation Arc Light]]. The wing deployed [[KC-135 Stratotanker]] aircraft and crews, November 1966\u2013 December 1975; with B\u201352 aircraft and crews, November 1966\u2013 September 1969, and with B\u201352 crews, 1970.  From 1  April to 1 October 1968 and 26  March to c. 21 March 1968, more than one-half of the wing was deployed to [[Andersen AFB]], [[Guam]] to support SAC operations in [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name=509BWfacts/>\n\n[[File:A 509th Bombardment Wing FB-111A aircraft drops Mark 82 high drag practice bombs along a coastline during a training exercise DF-ST-91-02468.jpg|thumb|[[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|FB-111A]] dropping [[Mark 82]] practice bombs during a training mission over [[Nomans Land (Massachusetts)|Nomans Land]]]]\n\nOn 1 December 1969 was wing redesignated as the 509th Bombardment Wing, Medium and began receiving the [[FB-111]]A strategic bomber in December 1970.<ref name=509BWbio />   The FB-111A was the all-weather strategic bombing version of the [[Tactical Air Command]] F-111 which was equipped to carry the [[AGM-69 SRAM]] that carried a nuclear warhead with an explosive yield of 200 kilotons.  The 509th would operate the aircraft for two decades. Won the SAC Bombing and Navigation competition and the Fairchild trophy in 1979, 1981, 1982, and 1983.  Awarded the Sanders trophy for best air refueling unit in 1982.<ref name=509BWfacts/>\n\nOver the next two decades, little changed for the 509th BW as it became SAC's fighter-bomber experts. However, a [[1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission|1988 decision]] by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to close Pease created major changes for the famous 509th. Headquarters SAC decreed that the 509th would not inactivate but would transfer to [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] to become the first B-2 stealth bomber unit. As such, the wing moved to Whiteman on 30 September 1990, without people or equipment.<ref name=509BWbio />\n\nAs the Rockwell B-1B Lancer came into service, the FB-111 became redundant to SAC needs. In 1988, Pease was identified as one of several Air Force installations to be closed by 1991 as part of a [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] (BRAC) recommendation.  The 509th's FB-111s were transferred from SAC to TAC between June and December 1990, being re-designated as the F-111G and converted into a tactical bomber.\n\n===Sole Stealth bomber unit===\n[[File:509th Bomb Wing - B-2 Spirit - 2011.jpg|thumb|509th BW B-2A being prepared for Operation Odyssey Dawn<ref group=note>Aircraft is Northrop B-2A Block 10 Spirit 82-1071 \"Spirit of Mississippi\", taken 19 March 2011.</ref>]]\nIn 1988, Congressman [[Ike Skelton]] (D-MO) announced the B-2 Advanced Technology Bomber would be based at [[Whiteman AFB]], [[Missouri]].  It was also announced that the 509th Bombardment Wing would become the USAF's first B-2 Spirit active-duty wing.  Military personnel began leaving Pease in June 1990, and on 30 September 1990, the 509th was inactivated at Pease and activated at [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] as a non-operational unit the same day without aircraft, personnel or equipment.  With the reassignment the unit was redesignated as the '''509th Bombardment Wing, Heavy'''. On 1 June 1992, the Air Force disestablished the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC), transferring all bomber aircraft to the newly established [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC).  The 509th was redesignated the '''509th Bomb Wing''' on 1 September 1991, and became part of the new [[Air Combat Command]] on 1 June 1992.<ref name=509BWfacts/>\n\nIn 1993, after two years of non-operational status, the 509th became operational again.  On 1 March 1993, the wing activated the [[509th Operations Group]] as part of the 509th Bomb Wing's reorganization under the USAF Objective Wing plan. All flying squadrons, as well as an Operational Support Squadron (OSS) were assigned to the 509th OG.    The wing grew larger on 1 July 1993, when it accepted host responsibilities for Whiteman from the 351st Missile Wing.  Its 509th OG received the first operational [[B-2 Spirit]] [[stealth bomber]] on 17 December 1993 (the date was the 49th anniversary of the activation of the 509th Composite Group and the 90th of the Wright brothers' flight).<ref name=509BWbio />\n\nSince its arrival at Whiteman, the 509th underwent inspections, tests, and other challenges to insure it was ready to return as an integral part of the nation's defensive coalition.  With the B-2, the wing can bring massive firepower to bear, in a short time, anywhere on the globe through previously impenetrable defenses.  The wing has deployed elements into combat over the skies of [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]] as part of [[Operation Allied Force]] in 1999; [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] in 2001 as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], in 2003 over [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] during [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], and in 2011 over [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]] during [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aerotechnews.com/blog/2019/07/17/northrop-grumman-b-2-spirit-20-years/|accessdate=3 March 2020|title=Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit \u2013 30 years}}</ref>\n\nThe wing began to continuously deploy to Andersen AFB, Guam, in February 2005. This deployment provides a continuous bomber presence in the Asia-Pacific region and augmented Pacific Command's establishment of a deterrent force.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/125133/wings-legacy-continues/|accessdate=3 March 2020|title=Wing's legacy continues}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 February 2010, the 509th Bomb Wing became part of the Air Force's newest command, Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC).<ref name=509BWbio />\n\n=== 131st Bomb Wing===\nOn 16 March 2006, the Air Force announced that elements of the [[131st Fighter Wing]], [[Missouri Air National Guard]] (MOANG), would become an associate unit assigned to the 509th BW.<ref>Air Force News, [https://web.archive.org/web/20060321212909/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123017598 Missouri Guard unit first ever selected for B-2 mission] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20061003235814/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123026903 Missouri Air National Guard gets sneak preview of B-2]</ref> The 131st Fighter Wing transitioned from flying and maintaining the F-15C Eagle fighter to the B-2 Spirit bomber. The final flight of the F-15C Eagle by the 131st occurred in June 2009 from St. Louis's Lambert International Airport.  The unit was redesignated as the 131st Bomb Wing on 1 October 2008.\n\nThe 509th and the 131st joined forces according to what is known as a \"classic associate wing\" structure. The active-duty wing, the 509th retains full \"ownership\" of the operational assets; aircraft, maintenance facilities, etc. Each wing has its own chain-of-command and organizational structure, but the members of each unit perform their duties in a fully integrated manner. Translation, active-duty and ANG pilots and maintainers fly B-2 missions and sustain the aircraft as though it were one unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.131bw.ang.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/443465/meet-the-131st-bomb-wing/|accessdate=3 March 2020|title=Meet the 131st Bomb Wing}}</ref>\n\n===Emblem===\nOr, in base a label Gules of three, surmounted by an atomic cloud Proper, between a pair of wings Azure; all with a diminished bordure of the first. Attached below the shield a White scroll edged with a narrow Yellow border and inscribed \"DEFENSOR VINDEX\" (Latin for \"Champion Defender\") in Blue letters.\n\nThe 509th Bombardment Wing's emblem is rich in tradition. Each symbol on the shield represents some part of the past. The Air Force wings represent the branch of service but are not in the familiar outstretched position. When the ancient Greeks approached a stranger, they raised their arms with palms outward to show they were carrying no weapons \u2013 a sign of peace. The 509th obtained special permission to display the wings in this configuration to show that it, too, comes in peace. The atomic cloud burst represents two things: that the 509th is the only unit to ever drop atomic bombs in wartime and that it still uses atomic power as a deterrent to war and defender of peace. Finally, the [[Label (heraldry)|'eldest son' symbol]] (the red 'tripod') shows that the wing is the oldest atomic trained military unit in the world.\n\n==Lineage==\n* Established as the '''509th Bombardment Wing''', Very Heavy on 3 November 1947\n: Organized on 17 November 1947\n: Redesignated: '''509th Bombardment Wing''', Medium on 1 August 1948\n: Redesignated: '''509th Bombardment Wing''', Heavy on 2 April 1966\n: Redesignated: '''509th Bombardment Wing''', Medium on 1 December 1969\n: Redesignated: '''509th Bombardment Wing''', Heavy on 30 September 1990\n: Redesignated: '''509th Bomb Wing''' on 1 September 1991<ref name=509BWfacts/>\n\n===Assignments===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Eighth Air Force]], 17 November 1947\n: Attached to [[3d Air Division]] after 1 February 1951\n* [[47th Air Division]], 10 February 1951\n: Remained attached to 3d Air Division Until 4 May 1951\n: Attached to 7th Air Division]], 4 June \u2013 2 September 1952\n: Attached to 3d Air Division, 10 July \u2013 8 October 1954\n: Attached to 7th Air Division, 26 January \u2013 30 April 1956\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[817th Air Division]], 1 July 1958\n* [[45th Air Division]], 30 June 1971\n* Eighth Air Force, 29 March 1989\n* [[100th Air Division]], 30 September 1990\n* Eighth Air Force, 26 July 1991 \u2013 present<ref name=509BWfacts/>\n{{Col-end}}\n\n===Components===\n'''Wing'''\n* [[33d Fighter Wing]]: attached 17 November 1947 \u2013 15 November 1948<ref name=509BWfacts/>\n\n'''Groups'''\n* [[33d Fighter Group]]: attached 17 November 1947 \u2013 15 November 1948\n* [[509 Bombardment Group]] (later 509th Operations Group): 17 November 1947 \u2013 16 June 1952;
