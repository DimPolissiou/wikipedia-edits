The modern Georgian military were founded in accordance with the government decree of 24 April 1991. 30 April, the day when the first conscripts were called up for military service in 1991, has been celebrated as the day of the Georgian military forces.<ref name=\"agenda1\">{{cite news |title=Georgia marks Armed Forces Day |url=https://www.agenda.ge/en/news/2018/916 |accessdate=10 January 2019 |work=Agenda.ge |date=30 April 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe Georgian military have fought in the [[Georgian Civil War|civil war and separatist conflicts]] in the 1990s and the [[Russo-Georgian War]] of 2008 as well as major international military missions such as in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Georgia was one of the first former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] to join the [[NATO]] [[Partnership for Peace]] program in 1994 and [[Individual Partnership Action Plan]] (IPAP) in 2004 and has sought to bring its military in line with the NATO standards.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|Georgian\u2013Armenian War 1918|Red Army invasion of Georgia|Georgian\u2013Ossetian conflict (1918\u20131920)|1991\u20131992 South Ossetia War|War in Abkhazia (1992\u20131993)|Russo-Georgian War|Military history of Georgia}}\n\nThe [[Georgia Train and Equip Program]] (GTEP) training was conducted using [[U.S. Special Operations Forces]] and [[U.S. Marine Corps]] forces from May 2002 to May 2004. During this time approximately 2,600 Georgian soldiers, including a headquarters staff element and 5 tactical units, received training. Another assistance program, the [[Georgia Security and Stability Operations Program]] (Georgia SSOP), was launched in January 2005 as a continuation of the (GTEP) of 2002-2004. [[Georgian Kosovo contingent|Georgian contingents]] were involved in the [[Kosovo Force]] and continue to participate in the operations in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]].\n\nThe DFG have been extensively reformed in the recent years to meet Georgia\u2019s aspirations to join NATO and for better response to the existing challenges such as the ongoing tensions in the unresolved separatist conflict areas in [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] as well as to the threats of global terrorism. Georgia also views a large-scale foreign invasion and the spillover of conflicts from Russia\u2019s [[North Caucasus]] as the worst potential near- and long-term scenarios, respectively.<ref>The Strategic Defense Review (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nOn August 8, 2008 the Georgian military conducted an operation in Georgia's breakaway region [[South Ossetia]] (see [[2008 South Ossetia War]]). The operation led to an armed conflict with forces from the [[Russian Federation]] and resulted in the defeat and expulsion of Georgian forces from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Following the military operations, Russia recognized independence of the regions, declared a decade ago.\n\nThe military budget of Georgia increased more than 50 times over the period from 2002 (US$18 mln.) to 2007 (US$780 mln.), reaching over 7% of Georgia's GDP. The military budget was then\ndoubled to the end of 2008 and currently since February 2009, counts 660 mln lari (US$366 mln.)\n\n== 21st century ==\n\n{{main article|Russo-Georgian War}}\n\nIn August 2008, following a series of fierce clashes in [[South Ossetia]], Georgia attempted to re-take the separatist territory by force.

Much of the captured equipment that was not subsequently destroyed got transferred to Russia or given to the separatists. Parts of Georgia's relatively modern artillery and anti-aircraft units were captured and later destroyed. Russian forces sank four Georgian naval vessels in the port of Poti, a coast guard gunboat in a naval skirmish, and hauled away nine rigid-hull inflatable boats. The Georgian Air Force lost two [[L-29]] jet trainers, one [[AN-2]] airplane, and four helicopters, all destroyed on the ground. Despite these mostly non combat losses, President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] claimed that Georgia had lost less than 5% of its military hardware, contradicting figures from the Georgian military itself.<ref>https://www.webcitation.org/5jZjEpcOy?url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=33974</ref>\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\n\nGeorgia immediately began a process of re-armament after the war.

NATO officially announced the complete support of the country's efforts in establishing the efficient military force that is required to defend the country against any regional threats and agreed on delivering high end sophisticated defense capabilities and boosting the overall quality of the GAF. The package also includes a group of NATO experts monitoring the process in order to control and ensure its successful implementation for the given time period. Further a large training center for joint military drills will be constructed. NATO did not state that it would directly arm the GAF but fully assist in acquiring requested military hardware and that it would lift the general arms embargo on Georgia that was in effect since 2008. After the last major conflict with Russia, Georgia repeatedly was denied the delivery of modern anti-air and anti-tank weapons and other heavy equipment despite heavy shortage on said weapons and numerous demands and harsh criticism from both the former and current ruling parties.\n\nAlmost immediately after the summit US defense secretary Chuck Hagel announced during his visit to Georgia that the US will start providing long requested UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters which is an arrangement reportedly outside the NATO package. Russia reacted very critical to the plan of building an international training center in Georgia claiming it would bring instability to the region. The statement was denied by NATO reminding that Georgia is a [[Partnership for Peace|PFP]] member and already provides similar capabilities such as an alpine warfare school for NATO and partner nations.<ref>http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_38988.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfwatch.net/u-s-to-strengthen-its-military-cooperation-with-georgia-34788|title=U.S. to strengthen its military cooperation with Georgia|date=12 September 2014|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-enlargement/nato-to-draw-up-measures-to-bring-georgia-closer-to-alliance-idUSKBN0F00IJ20140625|title=NATO will not offer Georgia membership step, avoiding Russia clash|date=25 June 2014|publisher=|via=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://agenda.ge/news/20406/eng|title=NATO chief details package to \"bring Georgia closer\" to Alliance|website=agenda.ge}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/world/story/1.2758750|title=CBC News - U.S., Georgia strengthen defence ties over Russian aggression|website=www.cbc.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/17/uk-georgia-nato-idUKKCN0I60SB20141017|title=Defying Russia, Georgia to host NATO training centre - minister|work=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=27100|title=Civil.Ge - NATO, Georgian FMs Hold Meeting|first=Civil|last=Georgia|website=www.civil.ge}}</ref>\n\n=== Alternative to MAP ===\nDespite knowing that there would not be any newcomers announced during the Wales summit, the Georgian government was confident that their country would at least receive the Membership Action Plan, which is the primary precondition for aspirant nations to become NATO member. Instead of the MAP Georgia was offered an alternative route which got accepted by the country's officials yet was met with very mixed reception.

The aim was to create two independently acting military districts which would consist of forces in accordance to the strategic value of their deployment areas yet being balanced in their type of equipment. In case of war each group will be able to coordinate its operations independently from high command, having its own logistical and administrative reserves.\n\n===Special Operations Forces===\n{{main article|Georgian Special Operations Forces}}\n\nThe Special Operations Forces of the Defence Forces of Georgia were established to conduct unconventional warfare and the full spectrum of special operation missions. They also serve in supporting capacity for regular military forces, primarily in the areas of education and training.\n\nTheir structure is as follows:\n\n*Finance and Accounting Service\n*Headquarters\n*[[File:Special Forces Group.png|31px]] Special Operations Forces\n** Special Operations Battalion East\n** Special Operations Battalion West \n*[[File:Special Forces School PNG.png|31px]] Special Operations Training Center named after Major Gela Chedia\n*Staff Company\n\nGeorgian special forces became first active in 1999 as part of [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]. Georgian commandos participated in the [[Iraq War]] from 2003 until the complete withdrawal of the Georgian contingent in 2008 due to an [[2008 South Ossetia War|escalation of hostilities in South Ossetia]]. According to independent accounts, a number of Georgian operatives were also deployed prior in Afghanistan to aide US Special Forces in hunting down [[Taliban]] leaders. Georgian officials have stated that a group of servicemen were deployed in Afghanistan for medical purposes.\n\n=== Army Air Section (former Air Force) ===\n[[File:Su-25ub.JPG|thumb|Georgian [[Sukhoi Su-25]] ground attack aircraft]]\n{{main article|Georgian Air Force}}\nThe Strategic Defence Review in 2007 described the Air Force consists of aviation and air defence assets and provides security to Georgia\u2019s airspace.\n\nThe Georgian Air Force was merged into the Army in 2010, and was renamed the Army Air Section, undergoing massive reorganization and restructuring. The additional operative section of the [[Georgian Land Forces]] currently consists of an unknown amount of planes, transport helicopters, gunships and 3,000 personnel. The Georgian Air Force lost two helicopters and a number of transport and trainer aircraft on ground during the [[2008 South Ossetia War]],\n\nTwo major airfields are located near [[Tbilisi]] at [[Alekseevka, Georgia|Alekseevka]] and [[Marneuli]].\n\n=== Georgian Coast Guard (Former Naval Force) ===\n{{main article|Georgian Navy}}\nIn 2007 the Strategic Defence Review said the Georgian Navy protects Georgia\u2019s territorial waters and contributes to the collective maritime defence in the Black Sea region.\n\nThe Georgian Navy was abolished in 2009 and was incorporated into the Coast Guard, which is not structurally part of the Defense Forces, but rather it is a subunit of the Border Guard of Georgia, which is under the control of Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia.  The [[Coast Guard of Georgia]] is responsible for maintenance of the sovereignty of the country and for protection of internal territorial waters and economic zones. The headquarters and a principal Coast Guard base are located at the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Poti]].\n\n[[File:Georgian coast guard in the port of Batumi.jpg|thumb|Georgian [[Coast guard|Coast Guard]] vessels]]\nThe other, smaller Coast Guard base is in [[Batumi]]. Besides the naval force, the navy also includes a Special Counter-terrorist Detachment force. Georgia is also one of the founding members and a participant of the [[Black Sea Naval Co-operation Task Group]]. Before the war with Russia, the Georgian navy had 19 naval vessels. 4 of them were sunk during the conflict, and nine rigid-hull inflatables were captured by Russia. The Georgians raised and returned to service two of the sunken vessels, and partially replaced their losses with Turkish-built patrol/fast attack boats. Their heaviest armaments are 25\u221230mm cannons. However, no Georgian navy vessels are armed with ship-to-ship missiles.\n\n=== National Guard of Georgia ===\nThe [[National Guard of Georgia]] was established on December 20, 1990 and was manned mainly by volunteers. It represents the first Georgian armed formation, which became the base of the foundation for modern Defense Forces of Georgia. The Guard actively participated in the conflicts that occurred in Georgian territory (Samachablo, Abkhazia).\n\nThe National Guard used to consist of 20,554 personnel, but has now been reduced to 550. The main missions of the National Guard are:\n\n#Support civil government in crisis situations (natural, technological, ecological);\n#Register mobilization resources, study and deliver;\n#Convene, select and man of citizens on the basis of the agreement, for the units, subunits and bases of the Defense Forces;\n#Provide ceremonial activity support;\n#Assisting in training the Reserve Forces.\n\n=== Army Reserve and Territorial Defence Forces ===\n\nThe Army Reserve is a professional reserve force consisting of former regular army personnel only. Due to the amount of experience, the Reserve personnel would be set-in for replacement of losses in the ranks of regular formations and will if needed also operate in the vanguard of a combined mechanized group or an infantry assault.\n\nThe Territorial Defence Forces were established for immediate readiness of the population in crisis events, such as war. Its main goals would be the fortification and defence of all populated and strategically important areas as well as providing quick aid or security for evacuation operations in case of natural catastrophes.\n\nOther than the active army reserve which consists of only ex military personnel, the Territorial Defence Forces are rather sparsely prepared for complex military operations. It instead provides more comfort for the regular forces in case of war. By acting as additional logistical arm and leaving the actual combat to them. With the land forces and reserve army engaged in direct action the Defence Force's most important task would be to construct trenches, bunkers and obstacles around strategically important areas and position themselves on systematically formed defensive lines. The number of conscripts does not exceed 140,000 and is reasonably large, as it is in the strategy's intention to use any possible geographical advantage over the enemy, when professionalism is compensated by that factor.\n\nThe TDF reservist is comparably poorly equipped for modern warfare. The number of combat, protection gear and supplies will be most likely limited in the event of war. The Territorial Defence Force consists of ordinary citizens of all occupations who undertake training in the basics of modern warfare. The weapons trained on are mainly of soviet origin and abandoned material used formerly by the regular land forces, including tanks. Such weapons are the AK series assault rifles and the [[RPG-7]] rocket propelled launchers.\n\n=== Commissioned officers ===\n{{Main article|Officer (armed forces)}}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armed Forces/OF/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Georgia}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OF/Georgia}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armed Forces/OF/Blank}}\n|}\n\n== International cooperation ==\n[[File:Georgian Army - Operations abroad since 1991.png|thumb|Operations abroad since 1991.]]\n[[File:GeorgianArmy.jpg|thumb|Georgian troops listening to a speech in Baghdad, Iraq]]\n\nThe Defense Forces have been participating in peacekeeping missions (the [[Balkans]], [[Persian Gulf]]) since 1999.\n\nUnits participating in peacekeeping missions are manned by professional soldiers, the duration of the mission is six months and participation is voluntary. The readiness assessment criteria are, as follows: health condition, physical fitness, professional skills and experience.\n\n=== Peacekeeping missions ===\n[[File:U.S. Marines and Georgian Army soldiers conduct operation Northern Lion II, Part I 130703-M-YH552-0074.jpg|thumb|right|Georgian soldiers during Operation Northern Lion II, Afghanistan]]\n{{Main article|Role of Georgia in the War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Role of Georgia in the Iraq War}}\n\nAbout 200 Georgian troops were deployed in the Kosovo ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]) in 1999\u20132008, 70 were deployed in Iraq ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|OIF]]) in 2003 and 50 in Afghanistan in 2004 ([[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]]). From 2004 in Iraq were 300 Georgian troops. From 2005 approximately 850 troops were serving under Coalition Command ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|OIF]] and [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq|UNAMI]]). On July 2007 Georgia sent an extra 1,400 troops to [[Iraq]]; that brought the total number of troops in Iraq to 2,000. About 300 of these troops were assigned to Taskforce Petro and stationed at COP Cleary outside the town of Wahida near Salman Pak, Iraq. On August 8, 2008 Georgia announced it will withdraw 1,000 troops from Iraq due to rising hostilities with Russia. Their preparedness and training skills are evaluated on highest level by international experts. The entire Iraq contingent has been airlifted back to Georgia.\n\nHence, owing to participation in international [[peacekeeping]] missions the military members are able to obtain practical experience and to show readiness to cooperate with [[NATO]] and with other partner countries' forces.\n\nCurrently there are more than 1,570 Georgian combat troops  deployed in [[Helmand]], [[Afghanistan]] where Georgia has thus far suffered 22 deaths and over a hundred injuries.<ref>[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23895 Tenth Georgia Soldier Killed in Afghanistan] Retrieved: September 1, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Seth Robson |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/u-s-training-a-dual-mission-for-georgians-1.136920 |title=U.S. training a dual mission for Georgians |publisher=Stripes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref> In September 2012, Georgia stated that it would continue its contributions in Afghanistan following the 2014 NATO withdrawal.<ref>[http://www.armyrecognition.com/september_2012_new_army_military_defence_industry/georgia_will_continue_its_contribution_for_nato_mission_in_afghanistan_in_post-2014_period_1009122.html Georgia keeps helping Afghanistan] - Armyrecognition.com, September 10, 2012</ref>\nIn November 2012, Georgia had doubled the number of troops deployed to fight with Nato-led forces in Afghanistan to over 1,500.

More recent developments however have their roots in the Soviet Union. In 1941 Georgia became one of the most important Soviet weapon manufacturing countries during the [[Second World War]]. It was responsible for providing the Soviet Army with all types of aircraft and ammunition. [[Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing]]'s role didn't change after the war. Up until 1990 Georgia was producing various types of fighter aircraft, most notably the [[Su-25]] since it was produced almost exclusively in Georgia, unmanned areal vehicles, missiles, satellite components and orbital satellites. The company lost most of its functionality and production capability when the Soviet Union dissolved, yet was not abandoned. In the late 1990s Georgia's JSC RMP and later the newly established Ministry of Defence section [[STC Delta|DELTA]] started to work on the development of ballistic equipment using their own ingredients. The advanced research unit had successfully developed a variety of personal protection gear, such as bomb disposal suits and level I-IV body armour using classified mixtures of domestic resource. These projects never went beyond some prototypes, mainly due to poor attention and financing from the government.\n\nWith foreign support primarily from the United States since 2005, Georgia became able to start building a solid industrial base for the military. From 2001 to 2007, Delta experimented with unmanned aerial vehicles and modified parts for helicopters and Su-25 aircraft until it got involved in the modification of Georgia's T-72 tank fleet. In 2009-10, with enough experience and expertise and the assistance of designer [[Zviad Tsikolia]], Delta created its first prototype of an armored personnel carrier, the [[Didgori Armoured Personnel Carrier|Didgori]]. Early tests were highly successful so that its first production line started already in 2011.  Two versions would initially serve in the armed forces in 2012, followed by different modifications from 2013 on. The [[Lazika]] is Delta's attempt to manufacture a suitable modular infantry fighting vehicle created for multiple tasks. While still under development, some Lazikas are already in active service. Delta considers the Lazika as one of the best vehicles of its class bearing armour technology similar to that of Israel. The remotely operated systems are locally produced as well. Due to \"misdirected financing\" and heavy interfering of former government officials, project Lazika was temporarily cancelled in late 2012, also due to \"sabotage\" and shortcomings in its armour research, but then later continued in early 2013 when a newly elected government took charge. \n\nAs of 2007 Georgia has been domestically producing uniforms for its military personnel. Early products were of poor quality, and such shortcomings were only corrected beginning in 2012. Since then only high quality fabrics are licensed for use. Other main production lines include various types of artillery systems such as [[MLRS]], mortars and corresponding ammunition, anti-tank weapons and devices, full uniform sets for ceremonies and for all service branches, including boots, hats, assault vests, pouches, and backpacks. New kind of ballistic vests and helmets have been developed and produced for military service since 2013. The Georgian production uses techniques based on know-how from aerospace research whose methods differ slightly yet significantly from foreign ones.

Georgia was one of the first former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] to join the [[NATO]] [[Partnership for Peace]] program in 1994 and [[Individual Partnership Action Plan]] (IPAP) in 2004 and has sought to bring its military in line with the NATO standards.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|Georgian\u2013Armenian War 1918|Red Army invasion of Georgia|Georgian\u2013Ossetian conflict (1918\u20131920)|1991\u20131992 South Ossetia War|War in Abkhazia (1992\u20131993)|Russo-Georgian War|Military history of Georgia}}\n\nThe [[Georgia Train and Equip Program]] (GTEP) training was conducted using [[U.S. Special Operations Forces]] and [[U.S. Marine Corps]] forces from May 2002 to May 2004.

Georgia also views a large-scale foreign invasion and the spillover of conflicts from Russia\u2019s [[North Caucasus]] as the worst potential near- and long-term scenarios, respectively.<ref>The Strategic Defense Review (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nOn August 8, 2008 the Georgian military conducted an operation in Georgia's breakaway region [[South Ossetia]] (see [[2008 South Ossetia War]]). The operation led to an armed conflict with forces from the [[Russian Federation]] and resulted in the defeat and expulsion of Georgian forces from South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Following the military operations, Russia recognized independence of the regions, declared a decade ago.\n\nThe military budget of Georgia increased more than 50 times over the period from 2002 (US$18 mln.) to 2007 (US$780 mln.), reaching over 7% of Georgia's GDP.

Much of the captured equipment that was not subsequently destroyed got transferred to Russia or given to the separatists. Parts of Georgia's relatively modern artillery and anti-aircraft units were captured and later destroyed. Russian forces sank four Georgian naval vessels in the port of Poti, a coast guard gunboat in a naval skirmish, and hauled away nine rigid-hull inflatable boats. The Georgian Air Force lost two [[L-29]] jet trainers, one [[AN-2]] airplane, and four helicopters, all destroyed on the ground. Despite these mostly non combat losses, President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] claimed that Georgia had lost less than 5% of its military hardware, contradicting figures from the Georgian military itself.<ref>https://www.webcitation.org/5jZjEpcOy?url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=33974</ref>\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\n\nGeorgia immediately began a process of re-armament after the war.

NATO officially announced the complete support of the country's efforts in establishing the efficient military force that is required to defend the country against any regional threats and agreed on delivering high end sophisticated defense capabilities and boosting the overall quality of the GAF. The package also includes a group of NATO experts monitoring the process in order to control and ensure its successful implementation for the given time period. Further a large training center for joint military drills will be constructed. NATO did not state that it would directly arm the GAF but fully assist in acquiring requested military hardware and that it would lift the general arms embargo on Georgia that was in effect since 2008. After the last major conflict with Russia, Georgia repeatedly was denied the delivery of modern anti-air and anti-tank weapons and other heavy equipment despite heavy shortage on said weapons and numerous demands and harsh criticism from both the former and current ruling parties.\n\nAlmost immediately after the summit US defense secretary Chuck Hagel announced during his visit to Georgia that the US will start providing long requested UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters which is an arrangement reportedly outside the NATO package. Russia reacted very critical to the plan of building an international training center in Georgia claiming it would bring instability to the region. The statement was denied by NATO reminding that Georgia is a [[Partnership for Peace|PFP]] member and already provides similar capabilities such as an alpine warfare school for NATO and partner nations.<ref>http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_38988.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dfwatch.net/u-s-to-strengthen-its-military-cooperation-with-georgia-34788|title=U.S. to strengthen its military cooperation with Georgia|date=12 September 2014|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-enlargement/nato-to-draw-up-measures-to-bring-georgia-closer-to-alliance-idUSKBN0F00IJ20140625|title=NATO will not offer Georgia membership step, avoiding Russia clash|date=25 June 2014|publisher=|via=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://agenda.ge/news/20406/eng|title=NATO chief details package to \"bring Georgia closer\" to Alliance|website=agenda.ge}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/world/story/1.2758750|title=CBC News - U.S., Georgia strengthen defence ties over Russian aggression|website=www.cbc.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/10/17/uk-georgia-nato-idUKKCN0I60SB20141017|title=Defying Russia, Georgia to host NATO training centre - minister|work=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=27100|title=Civil.Ge - NATO, Georgian FMs Hold Meeting|first=Civil|last=Georgia|website=www.civil.ge}}</ref>\n\n=== Alternative to MAP ===\nDespite knowing that there would not be any newcomers announced during the Wales summit, the Georgian government was confident that their country would at least receive the Membership Action Plan, which is the primary precondition for aspirant nations to become NATO member.

The aim was to create two independently acting military districts which would consist of forces in accordance to the strategic value of their deployment areas yet being balanced in their type of equipment. In case of war each group will be able to coordinate its operations independently from high command, having its own logistical and administrative reserves.\n\n===Special Operations Forces===\n{{main article|Georgian Special Operations Forces}}\n\nThe Special Operations Forces of the Defence Forces of Georgia were established to conduct unconventional warfare and the full spectrum of special operation missions. They also serve in supporting capacity for regular military forces, primarily in the areas of education and training.\n\nTheir structure is as follows:\n\n*Finance and Accounting Service\n*Headquarters\n*[[File:Special Forces Group.png|31px]] Special Operations Forces\n** Special Operations Battalion East\n** Special Operations Battalion West \n*[[File:Special Forces School PNG.png|31px]] Special Operations Training Center named after Major Gela Chedia\n*Staff Company\n\nGeorgian special forces became first active in 1999 as part of [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]. Georgian commandos participated in the [[Iraq War]] from 2003 until the complete withdrawal of the Georgian contingent in 2008 due to an [[2008 South Ossetia War|escalation of hostilities in South Ossetia]]. According to independent accounts, a number of Georgian operatives were also deployed prior in Afghanistan to aide US Special Forces in hunting down [[Taliban]] leaders. Georgian officials have stated that a group of servicemen were deployed in Afghanistan for medical purposes.\n\n=== Army Air Section (former Air Force) ===\n[[File:Su-25ub.JPG|thumb|Georgian [[Sukhoi Su-25]] ground attack aircraft]]\n{{main article|Georgian Air Force}}\nThe Strategic Defence Review in 2007 described the Air Force consists of aviation and air defence assets and provides security to Georgia\u2019s airspace.\n\nThe Georgian Air Force was merged into the Army in 2010, and was renamed the Army Air Section, undergoing massive reorganization and restructuring. The additional operative section of the [[Georgian Land Forces]] currently consists of an unknown amount of planes, transport helicopters, gunships and 3,000 personnel. The Georgian Air Force lost two helicopters and a number of transport and trainer aircraft on ground during the [[2008 South Ossetia War]],\n\nTwo major airfields are located near [[Tbilisi]] at [[Alekseevka, Georgia|Alekseevka]] and [[Marneuli]].\n\n=== Georgian Coast Guard (Former Naval Force) ===\n{{main article|Georgian Navy}}\nIn 2007 the Strategic Defence Review said the Georgian Navy protects Georgia\u2019s territorial waters and contributes to the collective maritime defence in the Black Sea region.\n\nThe Georgian Navy was abolished in 2009 and was incorporated into the Coast Guard, which is not structurally part of the Defense Forces, but rather it is a subunit of the Border Guard of Georgia, which is under the control of Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia.  The [[Coast Guard of Georgia]] is responsible for maintenance of the sovereignty of the country and for protection of internal territorial waters and economic zones. The headquarters and a principal Coast Guard base are located at the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Poti]].\n\n[[File:Georgian coast guard in the port of Batumi.jpg|thumb|Georgian [[Coast guard|Coast Guard]] vessels]]\nThe other, smaller Coast Guard base is in [[Batumi]]. Besides the naval force, the navy also includes a Special Counter-terrorist Detachment force. Georgia is also one of the founding members and a participant of the [[Black Sea Naval Co-operation Task Group]]. Before the war with Russia, the Georgian navy had 19 naval vessels. 4 of them were sunk during the conflict, and nine rigid-hull inflatables were captured by Russia. The Georgians raised and returned to service two of the sunken vessels, and partially replaced their losses with Turkish-built patrol/fast attack boats. Their heaviest armaments are 25\u221230mm cannons. However, no Georgian navy vessels are armed with ship-to-ship missiles.\n\n=== National Guard of Georgia ===\nThe [[National Guard of Georgia]] was established on December 20, 1990 and was manned mainly by volunteers. It represents the first Georgian armed formation, which became the base of the foundation for modern Defense Forces of Georgia. The Guard actively participated in the conflicts that occurred in Georgian territory (Samachablo, Abkhazia).\n\nThe National Guard used to consist of 20,554 personnel, but has now been reduced to 550. The main missions of the National Guard are:\n\n#Support civil government in crisis situations (natural, technological, ecological);\n#Register mobilization resources, study and deliver;\n#Convene, select and man of citizens on the basis of the agreement, for the units, subunits and bases of the Defense Forces;\n#Provide ceremonial activity support;\n#Assisting in training the Reserve Forces.\n\n=== Army Reserve and Territorial Defence Forces ===\n\nThe Army Reserve is a professional reserve force consisting of former regular army personnel only. Due to the amount of experience, the Reserve personnel would be set-in for replacement of losses in the ranks of regular formations and will if needed also operate in the vanguard of a combined mechanized group or an infantry assault.\n\nThe Territorial Defence Forces were established for immediate readiness of the population in crisis events, such as war. Its main goals would be the fortification and defence of all populated and strategically important areas as well as providing quick aid or security for evacuation operations in case of natural catastrophes.\n\nOther than the active army reserve which consists of only ex military personnel, the Territorial Defence Forces are rather sparsely prepared for complex military operations. It instead provides more comfort for the regular forces in case of war. By acting as additional logistical arm and leaving the actual combat to them. With the land forces and reserve army engaged in direct action the Defence Force's most important task would be to construct trenches, bunkers and obstacles around strategically important areas and position themselves on systematically formed defensive lines. The number of conscripts does not exceed 140,000 and is reasonably large, as it is in the strategy's intention to use any possible geographical advantage over the enemy, when professionalism is compensated by that factor.\n\nThe TDF reservist is comparably poorly equipped for modern warfare. The number of combat, protection gear and supplies will be most likely limited in the event of war. The Territorial Defence Force consists of ordinary citizens of all occupations who undertake training in the basics of modern warfare. The weapons trained on are mainly of soviet origin and abandoned material used formerly by the regular land forces, including tanks. Such weapons are the AK series assault rifles and the [[RPG-7]] rocket propelled launchers.\n\n=== Commissioned officers ===\n{{Main article|Officer (armed forces)}}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armed Forces/OF/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Georgia}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OF/Georgia}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armed Forces/OF/Blank}}\n|}\n\n== International cooperation ==\n[[File:Georgian Army - Operations abroad since 1991.png|thumb|Operations abroad since 1991.]]\n[[File:GeorgianArmy.jpg|thumb|Georgian troops listening to a speech in Baghdad, Iraq]]\n\nThe Defense Forces have been participating in peacekeeping missions (the [[Balkans]], [[Persian Gulf]]) since 1999.\n\nUnits participating in peacekeeping missions are manned by professional soldiers, the duration of the mission is six months and participation is voluntary. The readiness assessment criteria are, as follows: health condition, physical fitness, professional skills and experience.\n\n=== Peacekeeping missions ===\n[[File:U.S. Marines and Georgian Army soldiers conduct operation Northern Lion II, Part I 130703-M-YH552-0074.jpg|thumb|right|Georgian soldiers during Operation Northern Lion II, Afghanistan]]\n{{Main article|Role of Georgia in the War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Role of Georgia in the Iraq War}}\n\nAbout 200 Georgian troops were deployed in the Kosovo ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]) in 1999\u20132008, 70 were deployed in Iraq ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|OIF]]) in 2003 and 50 in Afghanistan in 2004 ([[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]]). From 2004 in Iraq were 300 Georgian troops. From 2005 approximately 850 troops were serving under Coalition Command ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom|OIF]] and [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq|UNAMI]]). On July 2007 Georgia sent an extra 1,400 troops to [[Iraq]]; that brought the total number of troops in Iraq to 2,000. About 300 of these troops were assigned to Taskforce Petro and stationed at COP Cleary outside the town of Wahida near Salman Pak, Iraq. On August 8, 2008 Georgia announced it will withdraw 1,000 troops from Iraq due to rising hostilities with Russia. Their preparedness and training skills are evaluated on highest level by international experts. The entire Iraq contingent has been airlifted back to Georgia.\n\nHence, owing to participation in international [[peacekeeping]] missions the military members are able to obtain practical experience and to show readiness to cooperate with [[NATO]] and with other partner countries' forces.\n\nCurrently there are more than 1,570 Georgian combat troops  deployed in [[Helmand]], [[Afghanistan]] where Georgia has thus far suffered 22 deaths and over a hundred injuries.<ref>[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23895 Tenth Georgia Soldier Killed in Afghanistan] Retrieved: September 1, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Seth Robson |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/u-s-training-a-dual-mission-for-georgians-1.136920 |title=U.S. training a dual mission for Georgians |publisher=Stripes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref> In September 2012, Georgia stated that it would continue its contributions in Afghanistan following the 2014 NATO withdrawal.<ref>[http://www.armyrecognition.com/september_2012_new_army_military_defence_industry/georgia_will_continue_its_contribution_for_nato_mission_in_afghanistan_in_post-2014_period_1009122.html Georgia keeps helping Afghanistan] - Armyrecognition.com, September 10, 2012</ref>\nIn November 2012, Georgia had doubled the number of troops deployed to fight with Nato-led forces in Afghanistan to over 1,500.

More recent developments however have their roots in the Soviet Union. In 1941 Georgia became one of the most important Soviet weapon manufacturing countries during the [[Second World War]]. It was responsible for providing the Soviet Army with all types of aircraft and ammunition. [[Tbilisi Aircraft Manufacturing]]'s role didn't change after the war. Up until 1990 Georgia was producing various types of fighter aircraft, most notably the [[Su-25]] since it was produced almost exclusively in Georgia, unmanned areal vehicles, missiles, satellite components and orbital satellites. The company lost most of its functionality and production capability when the Soviet Union dissolved, yet was not abandoned. In the late 1990s Georgia's JSC RMP and later the newly established Ministry of Defence section [[STC DELTA|DELTA]] started to work on the development of ballistic equipment using their own ingredients. The advanced research unit had successfully developed a variety of personal protection gear, such as bomb disposal suits and level I-IV body armour using classified mixtures of domestic resource. These projects never went beyond some prototypes, mainly due to poor attention and financing from the government.\n\nWith foreign support primarily from the United States since 2005, Georgia became able to start building a solid industrial base for the military. From 2001 to 2007, Delta experimented with unmanned aerial vehicles and modified parts for helicopters and Su-25 aircraft until it got involved in the modification of Georgia's T-72 tank fleet. In 2009-10, with enough experience and expertise and the assistance of designer [[Zviad Tsikolia]], Delta created its first prototype of an armored personnel carrier, the [[Didgori Armoured Personnel Carrier|Didgori]]. Early tests were highly successful so that its first production line started already in 2011.  Two versions would initially serve in the armed forces in 2012, followed by different modifications from 2013 on. The [[Lazika]] is Delta's attempt to manufacture a suitable modular infantry fighting vehicle created for multiple tasks. While still under development, some Lazikas are already in active service. Delta considers the Lazika as one of the best vehicles of its class bearing armour technology similar to that of Israel. The remotely operated systems are locally produced as well. Due to \"misdirected financing\" and heavy interfering of former government officials, project Lazika was temporarily cancelled in late 2012, also due to \"sabotage\" and shortcomings in its armour research, but then later continued in early 2013 when a newly elected government took charge. \n\nAs of 2007 Georgia has been domestically producing uniforms for its military personnel. Early products were of poor quality, and such shortcomings were only corrected beginning in 2012. Since then only high quality fabrics are licensed for use. Other main production lines include various types of artillery systems such as [[MLRS]], mortars and corresponding ammunition, anti-tank weapons and devices, full uniform sets for ceremonies and for all service branches, including boots, hats, assault vests, pouches, and backpacks. New kind of ballistic vests and helmets have been developed and produced for military service since 2013. The Georgian production uses techniques based on know-how from aerospace research whose methods differ slightly yet significantly from foreign ones. Among the first units to use these new items is the peacekeeping contingent currently stationed in the Central African Republic.\n\n== Bases ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Location\n|-\n|Ministry of Defence Headquarters\n|[[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|[[Vaziani Military Base]]\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|[[Krtsanisi National Training Centre|Krtsanisi Military Base]]\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|Akhalkalaki Military Base\n|[[Akhalkalaki]]\n|-\n|Alekseevka Airbase\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|Marneuli Airbase\n|[[Marneuli]]\n|-\n|Bolnisi Airbase\n|near [[Tbilisi]]\n|-\n|Gori Military Base\n|[[Gori, Georgia|Gori]]\n|-\n|Senaki Military Base\n|[[Senaki]]\n|-\n|Poti naval base\n|[[Poti]]\n|-\n|Mukhrovani Military Base\n|[[Mukhrovani]]\n|-\n|Kutaisi Military Base\n|[[Kutaisi]]\n|-\n|Khelvachauri Military Base\n|[[Khelvachauri]]\n|-\n|Khoni Military Base\n|[[Khoni]]\n|-\n|Batumi naval base\n|[[Batumi]]\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Georgia and NATO]]\n*[[Modern equipment of the Georgian Army]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{StateDept}} 2005\n{{CIA World Factbook|year=2005}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Denise Hammick, Country Briefing: Georgia On the Cusp, [[Jane's Defence Weekly]], 2 January 2008\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Military of Georgia}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140808052953/http://www.geo-army.ge/ geo-army.ge, an information website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121207132407/http://www.mod.gov.ge/2007/downloads/The_Strategic_Defence_Review(www.mod.gov.ge).pdf Ministry of Defence of Georgia: The Strategic Defence Review 2007.] ''mod.gov.ge''.

Contemporary variants include the ''pashmina'' and ''shahtoosh'' shawls (often mononymously referred to simply as the pashmina and shahtoosh). In the late 20th century, they evolved to middle-class popularity through generic cashmere products (rather than the higher-grade ''pashmina)'', and ''raffal'', shawls woven in the Kashmiri style, but using thicker [[Merino wool]]. Originally designed as a covering for men in India, it has evolved in the popular cultures of India, Europe, and the United States as indicators of nobility and rank, heirlooms giving on a girl's coming-of-age and marriage, and subsequently, as artistic elements in interior design.\n\nValued for its warmth, light weight and characteristic [[Buta (ornament)|''buta'']] design, the Kashmir shawl trade inspired the global [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] industry. The shawl evolved into its high-grade, sartorial use in the 13th century, and was used in the 16th century by Mughal and Iranian emperors, both personally and for honouring members of their [[Durbar (court)|''durbar'']]. In the late 18th century, it arrived in Britain, and then in France, where its use by [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Empress Jos\u00e9phine]] popularised it as a symbol of exotic luxury and status. The Kashmir shawl has since become a toponym for the [[Kashmir]] region itself (cashmere, named after ''Kashmir''), inspiring mass-produced imitation industries in India and Europe, and popularising the ''buta'' motif, today known as the [[Paisley (design)|Paisley motif]] after the factories in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]], [[Scotland]] that sought to replicate it.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe principal aspects of the shawl are its distinctive Kashmiri weaving technique and fine wool.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the Kashmir shawl's definition has varied in time and place, influenced by factors such as price, finery, purpose of wear, the intended wearer, constituent raw material, weaving technique, patterning present, and dyeing technique.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Skarratt|first=Ben|date=August 2018|title=From India to Europe: The Production of the Kashmir Shawl and the Spread of the Paisley Motif|url=https://globalcapitalism.history.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/globalcapitalism/documents/media/case_04_-_the_paisley_0.pdf|journal=Global History of Capitalism Project|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Today, ''shahtoosh'' shawls are no longer made because of a ban on the trade of products made from the Tibetan antelope.\n\nThe definition of the Kashmir shawl has differed in India and in the West. In India, the shawl was worn by men, with the fineness of the shawl indicating nobility or royal favour. In the West, depending on the fashion of the movement, the Kashmir shawl represented different types of commodities, originally worn by men, but thereafter by women, and then as decorative items in interior design. The definition has also been confused through fakery and imitation. Scholars, vendors and journalists have sometimes mistakenly used the words [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] and ''[[pashmina]]'' synonymously,<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> or assumed that they are the same because they derive from the same animal. In reality, ''pashmina'' is a particularly fine form of cashmere, so all ''pashmina'' is cashmere, but not all cashmere is ''pashmina.''

Contemporary variants include the ''pashmina'' and ''shahtoosh'' shawls (often mononymously referred to simply as the pashmina and shahtoosh). In the late 20th century, they evolved to middle-class popularity through generic cashmere products (rather than the higher-grade ''pashmina)'', and ''raffal'', shawls woven in the Kashmiri style, but using thicker [[Merino wool]]. Originally designed as a covering for men in India, it has evolved in the popular cultures of India, Europe, and the United States as indicators of nobility and rank, heirlooms giving on a girl's coming-of-age and marriage, and subsequently, as artistic elements in interior design.\n\nValued for its warmth, light weight and characteristic [[Buta (ornament)|''buta'']] design, the Kashmir shawl trade inspired the global [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] industry. The shawl evolved into its high-grade, sartorial use in the 13th century, and was used in the 16th century by Mughal and Iranian emperors, both personally and for honouring members of their [[Durbar (court)|''durbar'']]. In the late 18th century, it arrived in Britain, and then in France, where its use by [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Empress Jos\u00e9phine]] popularised it as a symbol of exotic luxury and status. The Kashmir shawl has since become a toponym for the [[Kashmir]] region itself (cashmere, named after ''Kashmir''), inspiring mass-produced imitation industries in India and Europe, and popularising the ''buta'' motif, today known as the [[Paisley (design)|Paisley motif]] after the factories in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]], [[Scotland]] that sought to replicate it.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe principal aspects of the shawl are its distinctive Kashmiri weaving technique and fine wool.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the Kashmir shawl's definition has varied in time and place, influenced by factors such as price, finery, purpose of wear, the intended wearer, constituent raw material, weaving technique, patterning present, and dyeing technique.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Skarratt|first=Ben|date=August 2018|title=From India to Europe: The Production of the Kashmir Shawl and the Spread of the Paisley Motif|url=https://globalcapitalism.history.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/globalcapitalism/documents/media/case_04_-_the_paisley_0.pdf|journal=Global History of Capitalism Project|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Today, ''shahtoosh'' shawls are no longer made because of a ban on the trade of products made from the Tibetan antelope.\n\nThe definition of the Kashmir shawl has differed in India and in the West. In India, the shawl was worn by men, with the fineness of the shawl indicating nobility or royal favour. In the West, depending on the fashion of the movement, the Kashmir shawl represented different types of commodities, originally worn by men, but thereafter by women, and then as decorative items in interior design. The definition has also been confused through fakery and imitation. Scholars, vendors and journalists have sometimes mistakenly used the words [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] and ''[[pashmina]]'' synonymously,<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> or assumed that they are the same because they derive from the same animal. In reality, ''pashmina'' is a particularly fine form of cashmere, so all ''pashmina'' is cashmere, but not all cashmere is ''pashmina.''

Retrieved 21 March 2007.</ref>\n\n== Technical specification ==\n\nExternally, the VZ200 resembles a cross between the Commodore [[Vic 20]] (whose name it closely resembles) and the [[Sinclair Spectrum]].  The VZ200 features the one touch command keys of the Spectrum, but unlike the Sinclair machines, their use was not mandatory.\n\nInternally, the VZ200 is a workalike of the [[Tandy TRS-80]] Model I.  The micro uses the same basic architecture, but TRS-80 programs cannot be loaded and only simple TRS-80 BASIC programs can be entered as it has a different memory map and some commands in BASIC are absent and can only be substituted by significant alterations in program algorithms, so it cannot be considered a true clone.\n\nThe connections consist of a port for an unregulated DC power supply (the voltage regulator is on the PCB), a stereophonic earphone jack for a cassette recorder, an RF modulated video ouput, an edge connector which is a printer and disk drive port, an edge connector that is a joystick port, and a composite monitor output (NTSC 60 Hz output in north America, PAL 50 Hz output in the British Commonwealth and continental Europe).\n\nThe VZ200 uses a copy of a [[Zilog Z80]] processor (made under licence by [[NEC]]) running at 3.58 Mhz (3.54 Mhz on VZ300) and was initially sold with either 4 Kb (Europe) or 6 Kb (in USA), which was increased to 8 KB within weeks of its release.  A 16kB expansion unit was available, increasing RAM to 24kB. The VZ300 was initially sold with 18kB of RAM. \nAn 8 kB system consists of 6 kB of RAM, 16 kB of ROM, and 2 kB of video RAM.  The memory could be expanded to 24 kB (22 kB memory plus 2 kB video memory).  Like the TRS-80, both memory and i/o locations are mapped.\n\nMemory Map :\n\n;VZ200\n:8K - BASIC ROM\n:8K - BASIC extensions and firmware\n:10k - cartridge (empty)\n:2k - keyb (empty)\n:2k -  video\n:6k - ram\n:16k expansion ram\n\n;VZ300\n:16K - ROM, BASIC and firmware\n:10k - cartridge (empty)\n:2k - keyb (empty)\n:2k -  video\n:16k - ram\n:16k expansion ram\n\n10kB was reserved for ROM cartridges.  No memory was provided for this on the circuit board.  This memory could only be used exclusively so was not practically available for RAM.\n\nExtended RAM was available above top RAM using the remote offset addressing method available on the Z80 (also known as bank switching).\nBanks of system memory can be reassigned using an offset above the top RAM.  Those banks are then no longer available, so program algorithms cannot be used in extended memory (as the program would \"disappear\" when extended memory is accessed), so it can only be used for program data.\n\nVideo RAM can be increased to access the higher modes of the 6847 since there are video RAM chip select lines on the memory expansion.  Remote offset addressing must be used because the video processor cannot address system or internal expansion RAM, externally connected RAM must be used.\n\n==BASIC==\n\nLike most early micros, the VZ including a built-in BASIC interpreter in ROM, which is used not just for programming, but for accessing the OS, recording programs, and all other operations on the micro.\n\nThe VZ200 uses a version of Microsoft Basic II, similar but not identical to Level II Basic on the TRS-80, including useful commands like SET, PRINT@ and IF-THEN-ELSE.  Firmware machine code routines are available using the RSX command.  The firmware contains a large number of useful routines provided by [[Zilog]], via [[NEC]].\n\nSome TRS-80 BASIC commands, such as RANDOMIZE, ON and the really useful DEF commands (only subroutines can be used for formulae), are not available, so only simple TRS-80 programs can be entered without alteration.\n\nThe Basic can use integers, decimals and floating point numbers.  Double precision numbers are not available, but can be used by storing the different power position numbers in a string and concatenating the strings.\n\n==Video==\n\nThe VZ200 uses the Motorola 6847 video processor, which has a resolution of 256 \u00d7 192 pixels made from either 8 \u00d7 8 pixel character blocks in a 32 \u00d7 24 block screen, or a monochrome bitmapped mode.\n\nAs the VZ200 is limited to only 2 kB of video memory since only 4 kB of memory in total was initially available, the screen is limited to only 16 lines down, making the total number of pixels in text mode 256 \u00d7 128 pixels. The bitmapped mode is unavailable.\n\nThe VZ200 has nine colours, an eight colour palette plus black.\n\nThe VZ200 has 256 predefined character blocks. Text is only available in upper case. The character blocks cannot be redefined.\n\nThe screen can use green mode or black mode, the latter using inverse colours.\n\n;MODE 0\n\nIn mode 0, the background colour can be either dark green or orange.\n\n;Text\n\nIn mode 0, text uses a black foreground with either background colour.\nThe first 128 character blocks are 64 alpha-numeric characters and their inverses.\nText mode 0 is the only mode in which black is available.\n\n;Block graphics\n\nThe latter 128 character blocks consist of a 2\u00d72 pixel block in each possible combination (8), in every of the 8 colour palette for foreground, together with either background colour chosen. Black is not available.\n\n;MODE 1\n\nFor mode 1, two colour sets are used with each background colour :\n\nSET 1 -> background : light green - foreground : light green, yellow, blue or red.\n\nSET 2 -> background : buff [white] - foreground : buff, cyan, magenta or orange.\n\n;Text\n\nText is identical to Mode 0, using either colour set for foreground with each background colour. The difference is that all 2kB of video memory is used, whereas only 512 bytes of video memory is used for Mode 0, and the text cannot be black, which is unavailable in this mode.\n\n;Graphics\n\nThe graphics mode has 128\u00d764 addressable points. For each character block, the background colour can be either light green or buff (white), with the foreground any of the four colours in the set. The colours can be used in any combination on the screen, but only one colour set can be used per screen, so screens are limited to five colours at most.\nBlack is not available in this mode.\n\n==Sound output==\n\nAn internal latch is used for cassette output, to drive the piezoelectric loudspeaker attached to the casing, and to control two signals for the 6847 video processor.\n\nThe loudspeaker is driven using a push-pull method, alternating the outputs on bits 0 and 5 of the latch.\n\nA 2.5 octave range is available.\n\nSound can be produced from BASIC using the sound command with the syntax :\n\nSOUND {frequency}(0-31), {duration}(1-9)\n\neg SOUND 20,4\n\nSound can be produced from Assembler by using :  LD HL, <pitch> / LD BC, <duration> / CALL 345Ch\n\n==Laser 310 / VZ-300==\n\nThe Laser 310 was released in 1985 throughout parts of Europe, [[China|Mainland China]] and the United States. It was named and sold as the \"Dick Smith\" VZ 300 throughout Australia and New Zealand. Also based on a Zilog Z80A CPU with a slightly updated 16k ROM version, it was driven by a television colour burst (3.54 MHz) crystal. It came with 16k of RAM for programming, along with the same 2k of Video Ram as that of the Laser 200. \n\nThe VZ300 had a small number of physical upgrades, but is completely compatible with the VZ200.\n\nExternally, the rubber keys were replaced with hard plastic capped keys.  The case was made with a less brittle type of plastic.\n\nVideo Technology used higher capacity memory ICs for the VZ-300, having 18kb of memory (16kb CPU RAM + 2kb video RAM).  The system RAM capacity was increased to 16kB, which together with 16kB of expansion RAM, makes a total of 34kB RAM for the system.\n\nThe VZ200 16kb RAM expansion could be used, but because of the way the chip select pins were arranged, only 8kB would actually be available.\nETI magazine in Australia published an electronic circuit which would enable VZ300 owners to use all 16kB of the VZ200 expansion.\n\n\nRare 64k VZ300 unit - There is at least one VZ300 known to exist with 66k of memory (64K RAM + 2K Video), built on the motherboard, built by Video Technology. This unit uses 8x HM4864P-2 8K Static Ram chips instead of the usual 8x 2K memory chips.\n\n[[File:Disk smith vz200 front.jpg|thumb|The Dick Smith VZ-200 computer]]\n\n== Laser 100 / Laser 110 ==\n\nThe Laser 100 and 110 were released just prior to the Laser 210 / VZ200.\nThese computers were a near identical clone to that of the TRS-80 Model 1.\nBoth computers were released with the same orange coloured keyboard 'chicklet' style keyboard on a black background.\n\n[[File:laser110.jpg|thumb|The Video Technology Laser 110 computer.]]\n\nBoth computers also had the same BASIC in ROM, of which, there are at least three versions: 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.\nThe laser 100 was released with 2K RAM + 2K Video RAM, whilst the laser 110 was released with 4K RAM + 2K Video RAM.\nBoth computers supported colour within the internal language interpreters (BASIC, Assembler), however, the output video from the NTSC and PAL circuitry only supplied black and white signals.\n\nThe Laser 100 and 110 computers were never released as a re-badged 'VZ-100'.\n\n== Laser 305 ==\nThe Laser 305 is an extremely rare computer produced by Video Technology. Essentially it is the Laser 310 motherboard placed inside the Laser 200 keyboard, of which, anyone with these two computers could perform themselves. However, the original release and the reasoning behind VTech releasing this particular configuration, unfortunately, has been lost to history. At the time of writing, there are only two known Laser 305's in existence.\n\n== Seltron 200 ==\nThe Seltron 200 Color Computer is quite unique. It was only sold throughout the two countries of Hungary and Italy and is unique with its own configuration layout of the motherboard; quite different to that of the other family of computers.\n\nThe Seltron's motherboard contained the same custom VZ300/Laser310 single packaged GA003 and GA004 chipsets (which replaced discrete VZ200/Laser200-210 components), though the design eliminated the need for the GA008 (clock register and DRAM controller) that is used in the 16Kb VZ300/Laser310. Some speculate that it was Video Technology's attempt at cost reducing the manufacturing process. It was released with the usual 2Kb of video RAM, along with 2Kb of user RAM (Same as the Laser 200), however, the motherboard allowed for further expansion of another 2&nbsp;KB or 4Kb of RAM. By adding an additional 2x 2&nbsp;KB user RAM it would bring the Seltron up to the same spec as an \"8K\" VZ200/Laser210. The Seltron also had the standard 16k ROM, and the motherboard allowed for the option of either a single 16Kb ROM package or 2x 8Kb ROM chip packages.\n\nOnly one Seltron is known to still exist today.\n\n== Peripherals ==\nWithin a year of the Laser 310's release, an 80k disk drive unit was released on to the market, of which two could be connected to the computer at the same time. A plug-pack cartridge containing the DOS ROM was required to operate the drives. The DOS ROM and diskette drives were backwards compatible with the Laser 200.\nA number of other VTech designed plug-in peripherals were also available for both the Laser 200 and Laser 310 computers. Among them were joysticks, cassette drive, light pen, printer plotter, 75 baud MODEM, word processor cartridge, and the 16k and 64k extended RAM cartridges. As numbers of users grew, so did the number of home-made kits which were on offer, which included a Speech synthesizer, [[Texas Instruments SN76489AN]] [[programmable sound generator]] chip, EEPROM programmer, data logger, 300 baud MODEM, full 101 keyboard, and a RTTY Ham radio kit.\n[[File:Vz periph.png|thumb|The VZ200 and VZ300 datasettes along with the VZ200 Printer Plotter]]\n\n== Software ==\nWith both of their releases in Germany, England, USA, Italy, Australia, New Zealand and a few other countries, commercially based software titles grew and were distributed throughout various outlets in their home county syets store fronts throughout Australia and New Zealand sold many titles, including educational and graphical games, finance programs and various software utility tools, most of which have been found and transferred for the use in the various emulators.  Unfortunately, there are a number of known software packages that have simply been lost through the age of time.\n\nDick Smith Electronics ran a program buying software from local programmers and selling them through their stores for $12 a cassette.  Most VZ200 programs were written in Australia, it is the equivalent of the [[Sinclair ZX-81]] in Australia (which was never really available because of production problems in the UK), a system which many early programmers learnt on.  The lack of foreign competition tended to encourage local programmers, programmers having little success competing with foreign programs on the most popular system, the [[Commodore 64]].\n\n*

Retrieved 21 March 2007.</ref>\n\n== Technical specification ==\n\nExternally, the VZ200 resembles a cross between the Commodore [[Vic 20]] (whose name it closely resembles) and the [[Sinclair Spectrum]].  The VZ200 features the one touch command keys of the Spectrum, but unlike the Sinclair machines, their use was not mandatory.\n\nInternally, the VZ200 is a workalike of the [[Tandy TRS-80]] Model I.  The micro uses the same basic architecture, but TRS-80 programs cannot be loaded and only simple TRS-80 BASIC programs can be entered as it has a different memory map and some commands in BASIC are absent and can only be substituted by significant alterations in program algorithms, so it cannot be considered a true clone.\n\nThe connections consist of a port for an unregulated DC power supply (the voltage regulator is on the PCB), a stereophonic earphone jack for a cassette recorder, an RF modulated video ouput, an edge connector which is a printer and disk drive port, an edge connector that is a joystick port, and a composite monitor output (NTSC 60 Hz output in north America, PAL 50 Hz output in the British Commonwealth and continental Europe).\n\nThe VZ200 uses a copy of a [[Zilog Z80]] processor (made under licence by [[NEC]]) running at 3.58 Mhz (3.54 Mhz on VZ300) and was initially sold with either 4 Kb (Europe) or 6 Kb (in USA), which was increased to 8 KB within weeks of its release.  A 16kB expansion unit was available, increasing RAM to 24kB. The VZ300 was initially sold with 18kB of RAM. \nAn 8 kB system consists of 6 kB of RAM, 16 kB of ROM, and 2 kB of video RAM.  The memory could be expanded to 24 kB (22 kB memory plus 2 kB video memory).  Like the TRS-80, both memory and i/o locations are mapped.\n\nMemory Map :\n\n;VZ200\n:8K - BASIC ROM\n:8K - BASIC extensions and firmware\n:10k - cartridge (empty)\n:2k - keyb (empty)\n:2k -  video\n:6k - ram\n:16k expansion ram\n\n;VZ300\n:16K - ROM, BASIC and firmware\n:10k - cartridge (empty)\n:2k - keyb (empty)\n:2k -  video\n:16k - ram\n:16k expansion ram\n\n10kB was reserved for ROM cartridges.  No memory was provided for this on the circuit board.  This memory could only be used exclusively so was not practically available for RAM.\n\nExtended RAM was available above top RAM using the remote offset addressing method available on the Z80 (also known as bank switching).\nBanks of system memory can be reassigned using an offset above the top RAM.  Those banks are then no longer available, so program algorithms cannot be used in extended memory (as the program would \"disappear\" when extended memory is accessed), so it can only be used for program data.\n\nVideo RAM can be increased to access the higher modes of the 6847 since there are video RAM chip select lines on the memory expansion.  Remote offset addressing must be used because the video processor cannot address system or internal expansion RAM, externally connected RAM must be used.\n\n==BASIC==\n\nLike most early micros, the VZ including a built-in BASIC interpreter in ROM, which is used not just for programming, but for accessing the OS, recording programs, and all other operations on the micro.\n\nThe VZ200 uses a version of Microsoft Basic II, similar but not identical to Level II Basic on the TRS-80, including useful commands like SET, PRINT@ and IF-THEN-ELSE.  Firmware machine code routines are available using the RSX command.  The firmware contains a large number of useful routines provided by [[Zilog]], via [[NEC]].\n\nSome TRS-80 BASIC commands, such as RANDOMIZE, ON and the really useful DEF commands (only subroutines can be used for formulae), are not available, so only simple TRS-80 programs can be entered without alteration.\n\nThe Basic can use integers, decimals and floating point numbers.  Double precision numbers are not available, but can be used by storing the different power position numbers in a string and concatenating the strings.\n\n==Video==\n\nThe VZ200 uses the Motorola 6847 video processor, which has a resolution of 256 x 192 pixels made from either 8 x 8 pixel character blocks in a 32 x 24 block screen, or a monochrome bitmapped mode.\n\nAs the VZ200 is limited to only 2 kB of video memory since only 4 kB of memory in total was initially available, the screen is limited to only 16 lines down, making the total number of pixels in text mode 256 x 128 pixels.  The bitmapped mode is unavailable.\n\nThe VZ200 has nine colours, an eight colour palette plus black.\n\nThe VZ200 has 256 predefined character blocks.  Text is only available in upper case.  The character blocks cannot be redefined.\n\nThe screen can use green mode or black mode, the latter using inverse colours.\n\n'''MODE 0'''\n\nIn mode 0, the background colour can be either dark green or orange.\n\n'''Text'''\n\nIn mode 0, text uses a black foreground with either background colour.\nThe first 128 character blocks are 64 alpha-numeric characters and their inverses.\nText mode 0 is the only mode in which black is available.\n\n'''Block graphics'''\n\nThe latter 128 character blocks consist of a 2x2 pixel block in each possible combination (8), in every of the 8 colour palette for foreground, together with either background colour chosen.  Black is not available.\n\n'''MODE 1'''\n\nFor mode 1, two colour sets are used with each background colour :\n\nSET 1 -> background : light green - foreground : light green, yellow, blue or red.\n\nSET 2 -> background : buff [white] - foreground : buff, cyan, magenta or orange.\n\n'''Text'''\n\nText is identical to Mode 0, using either colour set for foreground with each background colour.  The difference is that all 2kB of video memory is used, whereas only 512 bytes of video memory is used for Mode 0, and the text cannot be black, which is unavailable in this mode.\n\n'''Graphics'''\n\nThe graphics mode has 128x64 addressable points.  For each character block, the background colour can be either light green or buff (white), with the foreground any of the four colours in the set.  The colours can be used in any combination on the screen, but only one colour set can be used per screen, so screens are limited to five colours at most.\nBlack is not available in this mode.\n\n==Sound output==\n\nAn internal latch is used for cassette output, to drive the piezoelectric loudspeaker attached to the casing, and to control two signals for the 6847 video processor.\n\nThe loudspeaker is driven using a push-pull method, alternating the outputs on bits 0 and 5 of the latch.\n\nA 2.5 octave range is available.\n\nSound can be produced from BASIC using the sound command with the syntax :\n\nSOUND {frequency}(0-31), {duration}(1-9)\n\neg SOUND 20,4\n\nSound can be produced from Assembler by using :  LD HL, <pitch> / LD BC, <duration> / CALL 345Ch\n\n==Laser 310 / VZ-300==\n\nThe Laser 310 was released in 1985 throughout parts of Europe, [[China|Mainland China]] and the United States. It was named and sold as the \"Dick Smith\" VZ 300 throughout Australia and New Zealand. Also based on a Zilog Z80A CPU with a slightly updated 16k ROM version, it was driven by a television colour burst (3.54 MHz) crystal. It came with 16k of RAM for programming, along with the same 2k of Video Ram as that of the Laser 200. \n\nThe VZ300 had a small number of physical upgrades, but is completely compatible with the VZ200.\n\nExternally, the rubber keys were replaced with hard plastic capped keys.  The case was made with a less brittle type of plastic.\n\nVideo Technology used higher capacity memory ICs for the VZ-300, having 18kb of memory (16kb CPU RAM + 2kb video RAM).  The system RAM capacity was increased to 16kB, which together with 16kB of expansion RAM, makes a total of 34kB RAM for the system.\n\nThe VZ200 16kb RAM expansion could be used, but because of the way the chip select pins were arranged, only 8kB would actually be available.\nETI magazine in Australia published an electronic circuit which would enable VZ300 owners to use all 16kB of the VZ200 expansion.\n\n\nRare 64k VZ300 unit - There is at least one VZ300 known to exist with 66k of memory (64K RAM + 2K Video), built on the motherboard, built by Video Technology. This unit uses 8x HM4864P-2 8K Static Ram chips instead of the usual 8x 2K memory chips.\n\n[[File:Disk smith vz200 front.jpg|thumb|The Dick Smith VZ-200 computer]]\n\n== Laser 100 / Laser 110 ==\n\nThe Laser 100 and 110 were released just prior to the Laser 210 / VZ200.\nThese computers were a near identical clone to that of the TRS-80 Model 1.\nBoth computers were released with the same orange coloured keyboard 'chicklet' style keyboard on a black background.\n\n[[File:laser110.jpg|thumb|The Video Technology Laser 110 computer.]]\n\nBoth computers also had the same BASIC in ROM, of which, there are at least three versions: 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.\nThe laser 100 was released with 2K RAM + 2K Video RAM, whilst the laser 110 was released with 4K RAM + 2K Video RAM.\nBoth computers supported colour within the internal language interpreters (BASIC, Assembler), however, the output video from the NTSC and PAL circuitry only supplied black and white signals.\n\nThe Laser 100 and 110 computers were never released as a re-badged 'VZ-100'.\n\n== Laser 305 ==\nThe Laser 305 is an extremely rare computer produced by Video Technology. Essentially it is the Laser 310 motherboard placed inside the Laser 200 keyboard, of which, anyone with these two computers could perform themselves. However, the original release and the reasoning behind VTech releasing this particular configuration, unfortunately, has been lost to history. At the time of writing, there are only two known Laser 305's in existence.\n\n== Seltron 200 ==\nThe Seltron 200 Color Computer is quite unique. It was only sold throughout the two countries of Hungary and Italy and is unique with its own configuration layout of the motherboard; quite different to that of the other family of computers.\n\nThe Seltron's motherboard contained the same custom VZ300/Laser310 single packaged GA003 and GA004 chipsets (which replaced discrete VZ200/Laser200-210 components), though the design eliminated the need for the GA008 (clock register and DRAM controller) that is used in the 16Kb VZ300/Laser310. Some speculate that it was Video Technology's attempt at cost reducing the manufacturing process. It was released with the usual 2Kb of video RAM, along with 2Kb of user RAM (Same as the Laser 200), however, the motherboard allowed for further expansion of another 2&nbsp;KB or 4Kb of RAM. By adding an additional 2x 2&nbsp;KB user RAM it would bring the Seltron up to the same spec as an \"8K\" VZ200/Laser210. The Seltron also had the standard 16k ROM, and the motherboard allowed for the option of either a single 16Kb ROM package or 2x 8Kb ROM chip packages.\n\nOnly one Seltron is known to still exist today.\n\n== Peripherals ==\nWithin a year of the Laser 310's release, an 80k disk drive unit was released on to the market, of which two could be connected to the computer at the same time. A plug-pack cartridge containing the DOS ROM was required to operate the drives. The DOS ROM and diskette drives were backwards compatible with the Laser 200.\nA number of other VTech designed plug-in peripherals were also available for both the Laser 200 and Laser 310 computers. Among them were joysticks, cassette drive, light pen, printer plotter, 75 baud MODEM, word processor cartridge, and the 16k and 64k extended RAM cartridges. As numbers of users grew, so did the number of home-made kits which were on offer, which included a Speech synthesizer, [[Texas Instruments SN76489AN]] [[programmable sound generator]] chip, EEPROM programmer, data logger, 300 baud MODEM, full 101 keyboard, and a RTTY Ham radio kit.\n[[File:Vz periph.png|thumb|The VZ200 and VZ300 datasettes along with the VZ200 Printer Plotter]]\n\n== Software ==\nWith both of their releases in Germany, England, USA, Italy, Australia, New Zealand and a few other countries, commercially based software titles grew and were distributed throughout various outlets in their home county syets store fronts throughout Australia and New Zealand sold many titles, including educational and graphical games, finance programs and various software utility tools, most of which have been found and transferred for the use in the various emulators.  Unfortunately, there are a number of known software packages that have simply been lost through the age of time.\n\nDick Smith Electronics ran a program buying software from local programmers and selling them through their stores for $12 a cassette.  Most VZ200 programs were written in Australia, it is the equivalent of the [[Sinclair ZX-81]] in Australia (which was never really available because of production problems in the UK), a system which many early programmers learnt on.  The lack of foreign competition tended to encourage local programmers, programmers having little success competing with foreign programs on the most popular system, the [[Commodore 64]].\n\n* [http://intertek00.customer.netspace.net.au/vz200/index_files/Page299.htm Intertek's] software download page\n* [http://www.vz200.org/downloads.php Andrew's] VZ wiki download page\n* [http://www.vz200.org/bushy/software.html Bushy's] VZ software download page.\n\n== Emulators ==\nA number of emulators have since been written for these models of computers:\n\n* MESS VZ/Laser emulation by Juergen Buchmueller and Dirk Best\n* JEMU (for [[Java (programming language)|Java]]) by Richard Wilson\n* JVZ200 (for Windows) by James Tamer\n* [http://intertek00.customer.netspace.net.au/vz200/index_files/Page316.htm VZEM] (Windows and DOS versions) by Guy Thomason\n* Pocket VZ (for the Pocket PC) by Guy Thomason\n* Android VZ (for the Android OS) by Guy Thomason\n* [http://vzalive.bluebilby.com/emulators/ Download] page to a number of them is here\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nDisk smith vz200 rear.jpg|The back panel of the VZ200\nDisk smith vz200 ram expansion.jpg|The optional 16&nbsp;kB RAM expansion\nDisk smith vz200 operating.jpg|A VZ200 in operation\nDisk smith vz200 inside.jpg|Inside the case of a VZ200\nDisk smith vz200 with ram expansion.jpg|VZ200 with additional RAM plugged in\nVTech Laser 310 Color Computer and cassette deck.jpg|VTech Laser 310 with keyboard template and cassette deck\nLaser 305.jpg|A rare Laser 305 computer\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|VTech Laser computer}}\n* [http://gstsoftware.co.nz/ DSVZ200] \u2013 VZ200 emulator\n* [http://intertek00.customer.netspace.net.au/vz200/ VZEM by Intertek] \u2013 The official homepage of the VZEM emulator\n* [http://jemu.winape.net/ JEMU] \u2013 Java based VZ200 & VZ300 Emulator\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040515203620/http://ds.dial.pipex.com/town/square/chriss/machines/reviews/texet.html A contemporary review] \u2013 from [[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer]], April 1983\n* [http://www.personalcomputernews.co.uk/pcna/html/024/personal_computer_news_024_hardware_laser_200.html Laser Beams in at Just \u00a370] \u2013 from [[Personal Computer News (British magazine)|Personal Computer News]], 18 August 1983\n* [http://vz200.tripod.com/ The VZ200] \u2013 Tutorials and Programming\n* [http://vz200.ajlaird.id.au/wiki A VZ200 Wiki] \u2013 Information\n* [http://users.on.net/~clockmeister/ Clockmeisters] VZ/Laser310 page\n* [http://www.wolkenkratzerhaus.de/VZ/Historie.htm German VZ] dedication page with 600+ German VZ software titles.\n* [http://www.vz200.org/bushy/index.html Bushy's] Absolute everything VZ page.\n* [http://www.utorec.com/dv-5-001/uwp-001/uwp-106.htm Steve's] VZ page.\n\n{{VTech products}}\n\n[[Category:Z80-based home computers]]\n[[Category:Home computers|Laser 200]]\n[[Category:VTech|Laser 200]]\n[[Category:TRS-80]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1983]]\n", "name_user": "Polluks", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVideo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTech_Laser_200"}

Saint Michael's was founded in 1904 by the [[Society of Saint Edmund]]. Saint Michael's College grants [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees in over 30 majors to their 1,600 undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smcvt.edu/academics/majors-minors-and-curriculum.aspx|title=Majors, Minors, & Programs|website=www.smcvt.edu}}</ref> Housing availability is guaranteed for all four years although about 10% of students, primarily upperclassmen, live off campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smcvt.edu/on-campus/housing-and-dining/living-at-st-mikes.aspx|title=Living at St Mike's|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1889, priests from the [[Society of Saint Edmund]] fled to the United States after [[Anti-clericalism#The Third Republic|widespread anticlericism seized France]]. In 1904, they opened Saint Michael's Institute with an initial investment of $5,000.  Thirty-four students aged 10 to 22 enrolled, with a tuition and board fee of $105. Slowly, the school discontinued its high school program. Gradually, the school transitioned from an academy to a traditional residential college. In 1939, graduate programs were offered for the first time.\n\nSaint Michael's Playhouse was opened in 1947, bringing professional summer theater to Vermont, giving students the chance to work behind the scenes.\n\nBefore the 1950s, classes at Saint Michael's were small, just a few dozen Michaelmen in any class. In the 1950s, the college expanded to hundreds of students per class. To manage the influx of [[GI Bill]] students after [[World War II]], Saint Michael's acquired temporary housing in the form of military barracks from [[Fort Ethan Allen]] in Colchester.<ref>\"Transformation,\" Rev. Ray Doherty, SSE, Celebrating a Century, page 24, 2003. {{ISBN|0-9718323-2-3}}</ref> In the 1950s, the college began a building program that established the red brick architectural style that permeates campus today.\n\nIn the 1950s, freshmen were required to wear a dress shirt, coat and tie to every class and for the evening meal. All dorm students said the rosary before retiring.<ref name=\"bfp090614\"/>\n\nSaint Michael's Applied Linguistics Department was started in 1954, focusing on teaching English to students from around the world.\n\nAbout 130 refugees from the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] came to the college. Most of them, already well-educated, came to learn English.<ref name=\"bfp090614\">Burlington Free Press, June 14, 2009, page 4C. \"Reunion:Class of '50 looks back\".

The Quad is anchored by Durick Library to the west and the Chapel of Saint Michael the Archangel to the east. The three academic halls, Cheray Hall, Jeanmarie Hall, and Saint Edmund's Hall, along with the McCarthy Arts Center line the Quad to the south. The Alliot Student Center and the four underclass residence halls wall the Quad on the north.\n\nAlso located on the main campus are the [[George Jacobs (basketball)|Doc Jacobs]] Athletic Fields, [[Ross Sports Center]] and Tarrant Recreation Center, Founder's Hall, which houses the administrative offices, and the Hoehl Welcome Center, which houses the Admissions office. Standing at the main gateway of the school, admission interviews with prospective students are held in Hoehl.\n\nNorth Campus, one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from Main Campus, features additional residence halls, some apartments, and the Sloane Art Center, which has studio arts facilities for drawing and painting, the photography darkroom, and some classrooms.  Sloane also contains the Knights of the Round Table, a dining hall.\n\nBeginning in 2015, the school began closing many of North Campus's residential areas and sold much of the undeveloped property to University of Vermont's Medical School. This decision reflected the high cost of maintaining the aging housing and high deficits the school was facing. As of Fall 2018 North Campus is partially occupied by small summer programs, but during the fall and spring semesters is used exclusively for parking and art classes.\n\n===Demographics===\nAs of spring 2018, there were approximately 1,600 undergraduate students, about 20% of the students are in-state; of the 80% out-of-state, 2% are international.

Saint Michael's College grants [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees in over 30 majors to their 1,600 undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smcvt.edu/academics/majors-minors-and-curriculum.aspx|title=Majors, Minors, & Programs|website=www.smcvt.edu}}</ref> Housing availability is guaranteed for all four years although about 10% of students, primarily upperclassmen, live off campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smcvt.edu/on-campus/housing-and-dining/living-at-st-mikes.aspx|title=Living at St Mike's|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1889, priests from the [[Society of Saint Edmund]] fled to the United States after [[Anti-clericalism#The Third Republic|widespread anticlericism seized France]]. In 1904, they opened Saint Michael's Institute with an initial investment of $5,000.  Thirty-four students aged 10 to 22 enrolled, with a tuition and board fee of $105. Slowly, the school discontinued its high school program. Gradually, the school transitioned from an academy to a traditional residential college. In 1939, graduate programs were offered for the first time.\n\nSaint Michael's Playhouse was opened in 1947, bringing professional summer theater to Vermont, giving students the chance to work behind the scenes.\n\nBefore the 1950s, classes at Saint Michael's were small, just a few dozen Michaelmen in any class. In the 1950s, the college expanded to hundreds of students per class. To manage the influx of [[GI Bill]] students after [[World War II]], Saint Michael's acquired temporary housing in the form of military barracks from [[Fort Ethan Allen]] in Colchester.<ref>\"Transformation,\" Rev.

The Quad is anchored by Durick Library to the west and the Chapel of Saint Michael the Archangel to the east. The three academic halls, Cheray Hall, Jeanmarie Hall, and Saint Edmund's Hall, along with the McCarthy Arts Center line the Quad to the south. The Alliot Student Center and the four underclass residence halls wall the Quad on the north.\n\nAlso located on the main campus are the [[George Jacobs (basketball)|Doc Jacobs]] Athletic Fields, [[Ross Sports Center]] and Tarrant Recreation Center, Founder's Hall, which houses the administrative offices, and the Hoehl Welcome Center, which houses the Admissions office. Standing at the main gateway of the school, admission interviews with prospective students are held in Hoehl.\n\nNorth Campus, one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from Main Campus, features additional residence halls, some apartments, and the Sloane Art Center, which has studio arts facilities for drawing and painting, the photography darkroom, and some classrooms.  Sloane also contains the Knights of the Round Table, a dining hall.\n\nBeginning in 2015, the school began closing many of North Campus's residential areas and sold much of the undeveloped property to University of Vermont's Medical School. This decision reflected the high cost of maintaining the aging housing and high deficits the school was facing. As of Fall 2018 North Campus is partially occupied by small summer programs, but during the fall and spring semesters is used exclusively for parking and art classes.\n\n===Demographics===\nAs of spring 2018, there were approximately 1,600 undergraduate students, about 20% of the students are in-state; of the 80% out-of-state, 2% are international.  Undergraduate students at the college come from 35 states and 17 countries. Saint Michael's has 155 full-time faculty members; creating a 12:1 student to faculty ratio on campus. There are 439 graduate students who attend the college; over 90 percent are from Vermont.\n\n===Sustainability===\n\nSaint Michael's has taken many steps towards sustainability over the years.  It was named the first fair trade school in Vermont.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vpr.net/news_detail/93498/saint-michaels-designated-fair-trade-college/|title=VPR: Saint Michael's College Designated Fair Trade College|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>  Along with the initiatives in the cafeteria, Saint Michael's has an organic garden<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smcvtfarm.blogspot.com/2013/06/organic-garden-seminar-series.html|title=SMC Organic Garden|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref> that started in 2008 and has grown into a huge project for students and faculty alike.  The garden utilizes student volunteers through the Mobilization of Volunteer Efforts (MOVE)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smcvt.edu:443/Experience/Service-and-Activism/Move-Program|title=MOVE|website=www.smcvt.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>{{clarify|date=November 2017}} program and also works with summer interns and crew members to prepare the vegetables for Farm Stands that run from mid-summer through the beginning of fall.  The school also provides a free CCTA{{clarify|date=November 2017}} commuter pass to all students, staff, and faculty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cctaride.org/programs/unlimited-access.html|title=CCTA: Unlimited Access Program|access-date=June 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824010255/http://cctaride.org/programs/unlimited-access.html|archive-date=August 24, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  To improve water conservation, dual-flush handles for toilets have begun to be installed in various buildings around campus. All campus showerheads and sink aerators are low flow.  Saint Michael's College also took the St. Francis Pledge, a promise and commitment by Catholic individuals, families, parishes, organizations, and institutions to live their faith by protecting the environment and advocating on behalf of people in poverty who face the harshest impacts of global climate change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catholicclimatecovenant.org/the-st-francis-pledge/|title=The St. Francis Pledge|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref>  As part of the college's ban on bottled water, the Office of Sustainability<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smcvt.edu/On-Campus/Green-Campus.aspx|title=Green Campus|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref> has installed several water bottle fill stations throughout campus, allowing students to more easily use their reusable water bottles.  Saint Michael's College has been recycling throughout the campus since 1989 and also takes steps toward improving energy such as the Light Bulb Exchange Program (switching out standard light bulbs for energy efficient light bulbs) and 3 Degree Challenge (lowering temperatures in residence halls and academic buildings) while working to increase the energy and electrical efficiency of campus buildings.  Two most recently constructed campus buildings, The Dion Family Center and Residence Hall Four use geothermal wells to meet the greater majority of their heating needs. Combined with many education programs on energy consumption run by the Office of Sustainability, the college has reduced its carbon footprint by 29% since 2003.  Saint Michael's also offers both [[Environmental Studies]] and [[Environmental Science]] majors and an [[Environmental Studies]] minor for those students interested in further focusing on the environment from the perspective of natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities.\n\n===Housing===\nStudents at Saint Michael's College live in a variety of different housing facilities.  All housing is single-sex by floor or wing.\n\n====Main campus====\n*Joyce Hall, Ryan Hall, and Lyons Hall are three of the four main quad dormitories.

Some wings are reserved for Honors Housing and GREAT Housing, the alcohol-free living option.\n*Alumni Hall is the fourth dormitory building on the main quad, and houses sophomores and juniors.\n*Cashman Hall, Pontigny Hall, and Canterbury Hall consist of four and eight person suites for sophomores, juniors, and some seniors.  Many suites are reserved for Honors Housing, GREAT Housing, and Ambassador Housing.\n*Hodson and the newest building on campus, Residence Hall 4, are apartment style housing for juniors and seniors.\n*The Townhouses, numbered in series; 100s, 200s, 300s,and 400s, house seniors in apartment-style living. In the summer of 2008, kitchens were added to the 400s in order to accommodate the senior housing initiative.\n\n====Major additions====\n\nThe Dion Family Student Center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smcvt.edu/On-Campus/dion-family-student-center.aspx|title=Dion Family Student Center|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}</ref> is a $30 million structure creating a new 40,000 square-foot student center and 43,000 square-foot residence hall on campus, completed in the fall of 2013.

[[Park Ave.]] bandmate [[Neely Jenkins]] also contributed vocals.

Oberst has referenced the song \"Padraic My Prince\" more than once in his music. The song \"An Attempt To Tip the Scales\" on the album ''[[Fevers and Mirrors]]'' has a faux-interview near the end of the track. Oberst is voiced by [[Todd Fink]], who was a label-mate and had played in other bands with Oberst.) The interviewer is [[Matt Silcock]], another labelmate on [[Saddle Creek Records]]. The interview was meant to be somewhat sarcastic and most of what the Oberst impersonator said was not true. At one point the interviewer asks the question: \"So some of these references like babies in bathtubs are not biographical?\" The Oberst impersonator replies: \"Well I did have a brother who died in a bathtub . . . he drowned. Well actually I had five brothers that drowned.\" \"No, I'm serious. My mother drowned one every year for five consecutive years. They were all named Padraic, and that's why they only got one song.

After \"An Attempt to Tip the Scales\", there is a mock radio interview that features [[Todd Fink]] of [[The Faint]] doing an impression of Oberst while reading a script that Oberst wrote. In this interview, the fake Oberst presents a strange, contradictory explanation of his attitude towards his [[music]]. It acknowledges criticisms of his [[lyrics]] as overblown and insincere, which had begun to appear as the popularity of the band increased, but responds by stating that the lyrics are meant for personal interpretation. Oberst later commented that \"It was a way to make fun of ourselves because the record is such a downer.

An extensive world tour followed the release of those albums. Part one of the tour was in support of ''I'm Wide Awake'' and the second part was in support of ''Digital Ash''. The first part was more similar to past tours with an intimate band setting.

Oberst has referenced the song \"Padraic My Prince\" more than once in his music. The song \"An Attempt To Tip the Scales\" on the album ''[[Fevers and Mirrors]]'' has a faux-interview near the end of the track. Oberst is voiced by [[Todd Fink]], who was a label-mate and had played in other bands with Oberst.) The interviewer is [[Matt Silcock]], another labelmate on [[Saddle Creek Records]]. The interview was meant to be somewhat sarcastic and most of what the Oberst impersonator said was not true.

It acknowledges criticisms of his [[lyrics]] as overblown and insincere, which had begun to appear as the popularity of the band increased, but responds by stating that the lyrics are meant for personal interpretation.

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\".
