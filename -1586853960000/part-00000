It was a simple bamboo chapel at Castilla Street in [[Jaro, Iloilo City|Jaro City]], [[Iloilo]].<ref name=\"Baptists in Panay\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Lund and Manikan corroborated by Placido Mata, Vicente Doronila and Pascual Araneta translated the Bible to [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] vernacular \u2013 Ang Bagong Katipan (New Testament) and Ang Daan nga Katipan (Old Testament).<ref name=\"Baptists in Panay\"/>\n\nIn 1904, Rev. Charles Briggs opened out stations in [[Pavia, Iloilo|Pavia]], [[La Paz, Iloilo City|La Paz]] and Hinaktakan. In 1905, Lund helped organized the Baptist Training School and the Jaro Industrial School (now [[Central Philippine University]]), spread to [[Capiz]] where they established a Home School (now [[Filamer Christian University]]).\n\nIn 1923, a new church was built at the Plaza Jaro (the present site). Lastly, in 1950, a newer church (the present one) was built on the same site under Rev. Elmer Fridell. In 1952, the church was finished and was dedicated with Dr. Peter Hugh Lerrigo, the former president of [[Central Philippine University]] where he delivered his dedication message.<ref name=\"Baptists in Panay\"/>\n\nDuring the [[World War II]], the church was used by the Japanese Imperial Army.
