It also has some male derivatives, such as Anthonio, Ant\u00f2, [[Antonis]], [[Anto\u00f1ito (name)|Anto\u00f1ito]], [[Antonino (name)|Antonino]], [[Antonello (name)|Antonello]], [[Tonio (name)|Tonio]], [[Tono (disambiguation)|Tono]], To\u00f1o, To\u00f1\u00edn, [[Tonino (disambiguation)|Tonino]], Nantonio, [[Ninni]], [[Toto (disambiguation)|Tot\u00f2]], [[T\u00f3]], Tonini, Tony, Toni, [[Toninho]], [[To\u00f1ito (name)|To\u00f1ito]], and [[T\u00f5nis]].\n\nThe name derives from [[Antonius]], a well-known Latin family name, probably of Etruscan origin. The Roman general [[Marcus Antonius]] held that the origin of the name was [[Anthon (given name)|Anthon]] (\u0391\u03bd\u03b8\u03ce\u03bd), son of Hercules. This myth, recorded by [[Plutarch]], was probably created by Marcus Antonius himself, in order to claim divine parentage. The name was in use throughout the Roman world which, at its height, comprised the whole of the Mediterranean and much of Europe as well as the Middle East. When the Roman Empire became Christian, the name continued in popularity because of the many great saints who bore the name. Later, the name was spread all around the world as Christianity was introduced to other locations (e.g. the Far East, the Americas, Australia, and Sub-Saharan Africa).\n\n==Famous male bearers==\n\n===Antonio===\n{{for|all articles beginning Antonio|Special:PrefixIndex/Antonio}}\n*[[Antonio Abetti]], Italian astronomer\n*[[Antonio Abondio]], Italian sculptor\n*[[Antonio Aguilar]], Mexican singer\n*[[Antonio Bamboccio]], Italian painter and sculptor\n*[[Antonio Banderas]], Spanish actor \n*[[Antonio Rafael Barcel\u00f3]], Puerto Rican politician\n*[[Antonio Bassolino]], Italian politician\n*[[Antonio Barolini]], Italian writer\n*[[Antonio Bazzini]], Italian violinist and composer\n*[[Antonio di Benedetto]], Argentine writer\n*[[Antonio Beretta]], first mayor of Milan under the Kingdom of Italy from 1860 to 1867\n*[[Antonio Bonazza]], Italian sculptor\n*[[Antonio Bosio]], Italian scholar\n*[[Antonio Broccoli Porto]], Puerto Rican artist\n*[[Antonio Brown]], American football player\n*[[Antonio Bartolomeo Bruni]], Italian violist, composer and conductor\n*[[Antonio Cab\u00e1n Vale]], Puerto Rican singer\n*[[Antonio Caldara]], Italian composer\n*[[Antonio Callaway]], American football player\n*[[Antonio Canaletto]], Italian painter\n*[[Antonio Candreva]], Italian footballer\n*[[Antonio Canova]], Italian sculptor\n*[[Antonio Benedetto Carpano]],  Italian distiller, famous for having invented the Vermouth and consequently the ap\u00e9ritif\n*[[Antonio Marziale Carracci]], Italian painter\n*[[Antonio Cassano]], Italian footballer\n*[[Antonio Cavallucci]], Italian painter\n*[[Antonio Cerme\u00f1o]], Venezuelan boxer\n*[[Antonio Cervantes]], Colombian boxer\n*[[Antonio Citterio]], Italian furniture designer\n*[[Antonio Conte]], Italian former footballer\n*[[Antonio Raul Corbo]] (born 2009), American child actor and voice actor\n*[[Antonio Corradini]], Italian sculptor\n*[[Antonio Correa Cotto]], Puerto Rican criminal\n*[[Antonio da Correggio]], Italian painter\n*[[Antonio Corti]], Argentine boxer\n*[[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], Portuguese Prime Minister.\n*[[Antonio Davis]], US Basketball player\n*[[Antonio Di Natale]], Italian footballer\n*[[Antonio Dixon]], American football player\n*[[Antonio Donnarumma]], Italian footballer\n*[[Antonio de La G\u00e1ndara]], painter\n*[[Antonio de la R\u00faa]], former first son of Argentina\n*[[Antonio de Nigris]] (1978\u20132009), Mexican footballer\n*[[Antonio Escobar (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Antonio Esparragoza]], Venezuelan boxer\n*[[Antonio Falzon]], Maltese military engineer\n*[[Antonio Ferreira de Oliveira Junior]], Brazilian soccer player\n*[[Antonio Floro Flores]], Italian footballer\n*[[Antonio Fogazzaro]], Italian novelist\n*[[Antonio Gamoneda]], Spanish poet\n*[[Antonio Garay]] (born 1979), American NFL football player\n*[[Antonio Garcia (American football)]], American football player\n*[[Antonio Gonzalez]], Spanish Roman Catholic martyr and saint\n*[[Antonio Gates]], American player of American football\n*[[Antonio Gherardi]], Italian painter, architect, and sculptor\n*[[Antonio Ghislieri]], better known as Pope Pius V\n*[[Antonio Gramsci]], Italian writer, politician and political theorist\n*[[Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco]], former Venezuelan president\n*[[Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez]], Spanish film director and screenwriter\n*[[Antonio Indjai]], [[Guinea-Bissau]]'s army chief of staff and one of the leaders who orchestrated a coup in the country on 1 April 2010\n*[[Antonio Inoki]], Japanese wrestler\n*[[Antonio Janigro]], Italian cellist and conductor\n*[[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]], Brazilian creator of the bossa nova\n*[[Antonio Langella]], Italian footballer\n*[[Antonio Latimer]], Puerto Rican basketball player\n*[[Antonino Lo Surdo]] (1880\u20131949), Italian physicist and co-discoverer of the Stark effect\n*[[Antonio Lombardo (sculptor)|Antonio Lombardo]], Italian sculptor\n*[[Antonio Lopez (illustrator)|Antonio Lopez]], United States illustrator who signed his work \"Antonio.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Schiro|first=Anne-Marie|title=Antonio Lopez is dead at 44;

This myth, recorded by [[Plutarch]], was probably created by Marcus Antonius himself, in order to claim divine parentage. The name was in use throughout the Roman world which, at its height, comprised the whole of the Mediterranean and much of Europe as well as the Middle East. When the Roman Empire became Christian, the name continued in popularity because of the many great saints who bore the name. Later, the name was spread all around the world as Christianity was introduced to other locations (e.g. the Far East, the Americas, Australia, and Sub-Saharan Africa).\n\n==Famous male bearers==\n\n===Antonio===\n{{for|all articles beginning Antonio|Special:PrefixIndex/Antonio}}\n*[[Antonio Abetti]], Italian astronomer\n*[[Antonio Abondio]], Italian sculptor\n*[[Antonio Aguilar]], Mexican singer\n*[[Antonio Bamboccio]], Italian painter and sculptor\n*[[Antonio Banderas]], Spanish actor \n*[[Antonio Rafael Barcel\u00f3]], Puerto Rican politician\n*[[Antonio Bassolino]], Italian politician\n*[[Antonio Barolini]], Italian writer\n*[[Antonio Bazzini]], Italian violinist and composer\n*[[Antonio di Benedetto]], Argentine writer\n*[[Antonio Beretta]], first mayor of Milan under the Kingdom of Italy from 1860 to 1867\n*[[Antonio Bonazza]], Italian sculptor\n*[[Antonio Bosio]], Italian scholar\n*[[Antonio Broccoli Porto]], Puerto Rican artist\n*[[Antonio Brown]], American football player\n*[[Antonio Bartolomeo Bruni]], Italian violist, composer and conductor\n*[[Antonio Cab\u00e1n Vale]], Puerto Rican singer\n*[[Antonio Caldara]], Italian composer\n*[[Antonio Callaway]], American football player\n*[[Antonio Canaletto]], Italian painter\n*[[Antonio Candreva]], Italian footballer\n*[[Antonio Canova]], Italian sculptor\n*[[Antonio Benedetto Carpano]],  Italian distiller, famous for having invented the Vermouth and consequently the ap\u00e9ritif\n*[[Antonio Marziale Carracci]], Italian painter\n*[[Antonio Cassano]], Italian footballer\n*[[Antonio Cavallucci]], Italian painter\n*[[Antonio Cerme\u00f1o]], Venezuelan boxer\n*[[Antonio Cervantes]], Colombian boxer\n*[[Antonio Citterio]], Italian furniture designer\n*[[Antonio Conte]], Italian former footballer\n*[[Antonio Raul Corbo]] (born 2009), American child actor and voice actor\n*[[Antonio Corradini]], Italian sculptor\n*[[Antonio Correa Cotto]], Puerto Rican criminal\n*[[Antonio da Correggio]], Italian painter\n*[[Antonio Corti]], Argentine boxer\n*[[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], Portuguese Prime Minister.\n*[[Antonio Davis]], US Basketball player\n*[[Antonio Di Natale]], Italian footballer\n*[[Antonio Dixon]], American football player\n*[[Antonio Donnarumma]], Italian footballer\n*[[Antonio de La G\u00e1ndara]], painter\n*[[Antonio de la R\u00faa]], former first son of Argentina\n*[[Antonio de Nigris]] (1978\u20132009), Mexican footballer\n*[[Antonio Escobar (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Antonio Esparragoza]], Venezuelan boxer\n*[[Antonio Falzon]], Maltese military engineer\n*[[Antonio Ferreira de Oliveira Junior]], Brazilian soccer player\n*[[Antonio Floro Flores]], Italian footballer\n*[[Antonio Fogazzaro]], Italian novelist\n*[[Antonio Gamoneda]], Spanish poet\n*[[Antonio Garay]] (born 1979), American NFL football player\n*[[Antonio Garcia (American football)]], American football player\n*[[Antonio Gonzalez]], Spanish Roman Catholic martyr and saint\n*[[Antonio Gates]], American player of American football\n*[[Antonio Gherardi]], Italian painter, architect, and sculptor\n*[[Antonio Ghislieri]], better known as Pope Pius V\n*[[Antonio Gramsci]], Italian writer, politician and political theorist\n*[[Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco]], former Venezuelan president\n*[[Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez]], Spanish film director and screenwriter\n*[[Antonio Indjai]], [[Guinea-Bissau]]'s army chief of staff and one of the leaders who orchestrated a coup in the country on 1 April 2010\n*[[Antonio Inoki]], Japanese wrestler\n*[[Antonio Janigro]], Italian cellist and conductor\n*[[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]], Brazilian creator of the bossa nova\n*[[Antonio Langella]], Italian footballer\n*[[Antonio Latimer]], Puerto Rican basketball player\n*[[Antonino Lo Surdo]] (1880\u20131949), Italian physicist and co-discoverer of the Stark effect\n*[[Antonio Lombardo (sculptor)|Antonio Lombardo]], Italian sculptor\n*[[Antonio Lopez (illustrator)|Antonio Lopez]], United States illustrator who signed his work \"Antonio.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Schiro|first=Anne-Marie|title=Antonio Lopez is dead at 44;

The wings had wooden box [[wing spar|spar]]s and spruce [[wing ribs]] in a [[Warren girder]] arrangement, and were braced to the fuselage by streamlined struts.<ref name=\"westp177\">{{Harvnb|James|1991|p=177}}</ref> \n\nThe Westland IV first flew on 21 February 1929 at which time it was powered by the 95&nbsp;hp (71&nbsp;Kw) [[Cirrus Aero-Engines|Cirrus]] engine. This prototype was registered as G-EBXK and was certified for a crew of two and four passengers. The second machine had [[ADC Cirrus|Hermes]] engines and a metal rear fuselage. The third machine, G-ABAJ, was modified to take the 105&nbsp;hp (78&nbsp;Kw) [[Armstrong Siddeley Genet Major]] engines as well as some other changes and became the prototype Westland Wessex. The two Westland IVs were subsequently converted to Wessexes giving 10 aircraft in total.\n\n==Cobham Air Routes Ltd==\nThe Wessex was noted for its reliability and ability to make short landing runs. This made it attractive to Sir [[Alan Cobham]] in 1935 when he was looking for a small airliner to use for a service between [[Guernsey]] and the British mainland. Previously, [[flying boat]]s had provided a service between [[Portsmouth]] and [[St Peter Port]] on the island. There was no public airfield at the time on Guernsey, only the private airfield at [[L'Eree]] run by the [[Guernsey Aero Club]], of which Cobham was a member. The Wessex was certified as the only commercial aircraft to use L'Eree. Cobham's airline, Cobham Air Routes Ltd, used the following Wessex aircraft:\n\n'''G-EBXK''' \u2013 Westland serial number 1771, granted its certificate of airworthiness on 21 March 1929. Originally the prototype Westland IV and retained as a demonstrator, later converted to a Wessex and sold to Cobham Air Routes Ltd in 1935 and withdrawn from use in 1936.\n\n'''G-ABAJ''' \u2013 Westland serial number 1897, granted its certificate of airworthiness on 27 May 1930. Built as a Westland IV and registered as G-AAJI, originally intended for service in Kenya with Wilson's Airways but the order was never taken up. Instead, G-AAJI was rebuilt as a Wessex and sold to Sabena with Belgian registration OO-AGC, before being in turn sold to Cobham in 1935. This aircraft was used by Trafalgar Advertising in 1936.\n\n'''G-ADEW''' \u2013 Westland serial number 1899, granted its certificate of airworthiness on 6 August 1930, sold to [[Sabena]] and registered as OO-AGF, then bought by Cobham in 1935. Unfortunately, this aircraft was lost in the Channel on 3 July 1935, 3 to 4 miles south off The Needles. The only passenger on board, a Mr C F Grainger, was picked up by the SS Stanmore and taken to Fowey. The pilot, W H Ogden, was presumed drowned within the aircraft and was never found. The blame was largely placed on Ogden, but was probably also due to the age of the Wessex airframes and their engines. This accident was the last straw for Sir Alan, who was struggling operationally, and he sold his airline to Olley Air Service.\n\n'''G-ADFZ''' \u2013 Westland serial number 1900, granted its certificate of airworthiness on 30 August 1930, sold to Sabena and registered as OO-AGF, and bought by Cobham in 1935. G-ADFZ went on to work for Trafalgar Advertising with G-ABAJ, and it was decided to take G-ADFZ to [[Blackpool]] for the air display in September 1935. On 7 September 1935 it was involved in a collision over Blackpool with an [[Avro 504|Avro 504N]] (G-ACOD), the Wessex crashing in [[Cedar Square]] with the crew safe but all three occupants of the Avro being killed. Repaired, G-ADFZ was finally withdrawn from service on 1 December 1946.\n\n== Operators ==\n;{{flag|Egypt|1922}}\n* [[Egyptian Air Force]]\n;{{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* AST Ltd, Hamble \u2013 taken on by RAF and used as navigation trainers from 1939\n* Great Western Railway Air Services Ltd \u2013 passenger air services between [[Cardiff Municipal Airport]] and Plymouth (1934\u20131939)\n* [[Cobham Air Routes]] \u2013 passenger air services between [[Christchurch Airfield]] and Guernsey L'Eree (1935)\n* Portsmouth, Southsea and Isle of Wight Aviation Co., Ltd \u2013 passenger services.\n* Imperial Airways \u2013 passenger services.\n* Trafalgar Advertising Co Ltd \u2013 night-time airborne illuminated advertising, including for [[Oxo (food)|Oxo]].\n;{{flag|Belgium}}\n*[[sabena|SABENA]] \u2013 passenger services, sold their aircraft to Cobham Air Routes Ltd in 1935.\n\n==Specifications Wessex (Genet Major 1A)==\n[[File:Westland_IV_3-view_NACA_Aircraft_Circular_No.95.jpg|thumb|Westland IV 3-view drawing from NACA Aircraft Circular No.95]]\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=British Civil Aircraft 1919\u20131972: Volume III<ref name=\"Jackson civil v3p246-7\">{{Harvnb|Jackson|1988|pp=246\u2013247}}</ref>\n|prime units?=imp\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|genhide= \n\n|crew=2 (pilot and mechanic)\n|capacity=4 passengers\n|length m=\n|length ft=38\n|length in=0\n|span m=\n|span ft=57\n|span in=6\n|height m=\n|height ft=9\n|height in=6\n|wing area sqm=\n|wing area sqft=490\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=3891\n|gross weight kg=\n|max takeoff weight lb=6300\n|fuel capacity=\n<!--\n        Powerplant\n-->\n|eng1 number=3\n|eng1 name=[[Armstrong Siddeley Genet Major]] 1A \n|eng1 type=seven-cylinder air-cooled [[radial engine]]\n|eng1 kw=<!-- prop engines -->\n|eng1 hp=140<!-- prop engines -->\n\n|prop blade number=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop name=\n|prop dia m=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia ft=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n|prop dia in=<!-- propeller aircraft -->\n\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|perfhide=\n\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=122\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed mach=<!-- supersonic aircraft -->\n|cruise speed kmh=<!-- if max speed unknown -->\n|cruise speed mph=100<!-- if max speed unknown -->\n|cruise speed kts=\n|range km=\n|range miles=420\n|range nmi=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=14900\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=680\n|more performance=\n\n|avionics=\n}}\n\n<!-- ==See also== -->\n{{aircontent\n<!-- designs which were developed into or from this aircraft: -->\n|related=\n\n<!-- aircraft similar in appearance or function to this design: -->\n|similar aircraft=\n\n<!-- any lists that are appropriate: -->\n|lists=\n\n<!-- other articles that could be useful to connect with: -->\n|see also=\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Jackson |first=A.

The character was also extensively featured in cinema, television, radio, comic strips and comic books for over 90 years and he has also become an [[archetype]] of the [[Supervillain|evil criminal genius]] and [[mad scientist]], while lending the name to the [[Fu Manchu moustache|Fu Manchu mustache]].\n\n== Background ==\nAccording to his own account, Sax Rohmer, without any prior knowledge and understanding of Chinese culture, decided to start the Dr. Fu Manchu series after his [[Ouija board]] spelled out C-H-I-N-A-M-A-N when he asked what would make his fortune.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/fu-manchu-and-china-was-the-yellow-peril-incarnate-really-appallingly-racist-a6701766.html|title=Fu Manchu and China: Was the 'yellow peril incarnate' really appallingly racist?|work=The Independent|access-date=2019-10-02|language=en}}</ref> During this time period, the notion of the \"[[Yellow Peril]]\" was spreading in North American society.

[[Fungus|fungi]] and my tiny allies, the [[Bacillus|bacilli]]&nbsp;... my black spiders\" and other peculiar animals or natural chemical weapons. He has a great respect for the truth (in fact, his word is his bond), and uses torture and other gruesome tactics to dispose of his enemies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1228548/racist-curse-fu-manchu-back-spotlight-after-chevrolet-ad|title=The racist curse of Fu Manchu back in spotlight after Chevrolet ad|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en}}</ref>\n\nDr. Fu Manchu is described as a mysterious villain because he seldom appears on the scene. He always sends his minions to commit crimes for him. In the novel ''The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu'', he sends a beautiful young girl to the crime scene to see the victim is dead. He also sends a dacoit to attack Sir Denis Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie.\n\nIn the novel ''Fu Manchu's Bride'' (1933), Dr. Fu Manchu claims to hold doctorates from four Western universities, while in ''Emperor Fu Manchu'' (1959), he states that he attended [[Heidelberg University]], the [[Sorbonne]], and the [[University of Edinburgh]] (in the film ''The Mask of Fu Manchu'', however, he states proudly that \"I am a doctor of philosophy from Edinburgh, a doctor of law from Christ's College, a doctor of medicine from Harvard. My friends, out of courtesy, call me 'Doctor' \".). At the time of their first encounter (1911), Dr. Petrie believed that Dr. Fu Manchu was more than 70 years old. This would mean he was studying for his first doctorate in the 1860s or 1870s.\n\nAccording to [[Cay Van Ash]], Rohmer's biographer and former assistant who became the first author to continue the series after Rohmer's death, \"Fu Manchu\" was a title of honor, which meant \"the warlike [[Manchu people|Manchu]]\". Van Ash speculates that Dr. Fu Manchu had been a member of the [[Qing dynasty|imperial family of China]], who had backed the losing side in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In the early books (1913\u20131917), Dr. Fu Manchu is an agent of the Chinese [[Tong (organization)|tong]] known as the Si-Fan and acts as the mastermind behind a wave of assassinations targeting Western imperialists. In the later books (1931\u20131959), he has gained control of the Si-Fan, which has been changed from a mere Chinese tong into an international criminal organization under his leadership which, in addition to attempting to take over the world and restore China to its ancient glory (Dr. Fu Manchu's main goals right from the beginning), also tries to rout [[Fascism|fascist]] dictators and then halt the spread of worldwide [[Communism]] both for its leader's own selfish reasons, Dr. Fu Manchu knowing them both to be major rivals in his plans for world domination. The Si-Fan is largely funded through criminal activities, particularly the drug trade and [[human trafficking]] (or \"white slavery\"). Dr. Fu Manchu has extended his already considerable lifespan by use of the [[elixir of life]], a formula that he had spent decades trying to perfect.\n\n====Dr. Fu Manchu's appearance/the Fu Manchu mustache====\nThe most representative part of Dr. Fu Manchu\u2019s appearance is his mustache. The mustache is also registered on dictionaries, and not only registered as Dr. Fu Manchu\u2019s mustache, but also just registered as a Fu Manchu, which shows that the mustache of Dr. Fu Manchu has become an iconic characteristic of him. The Fu Manchu/Fu Manchu mustache is described as a long, narrow mustache whose ends taper and droop down to the chin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fu_manchu|title=Fu Manchu {{!}} Definition of Fu Manchu in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n===Sir Denis Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie===\nOpposing Dr. Fu Manchu in the stories are Sir Denis Nayland Smith and, in the first three books, Dr. Petrie. They are in the [[Sherlock Holmes|Holmes]] and [[Dr. Watson|Watson]] tradition, with Petrie narrating the stories (after the third book, they would be narrated by various others allied with Smith right up to the end of the series) while Smith carries the fight, combating Dr. Fu Manchu more by sheer luck and dogged determination than intellectual brilliance (except ''in extremis''). Smith and Dr. Fu Manchu share a grudging respect for one another, as each believes that a man must keep his word, even to an enemy.\n\nIn the first three books, Smith is a colonial police commissioner in Burma granted a [[roving commission]], which allows him to exercise authority over any group that can help him in his mission. He resembles [[Sherlock Holmes]] in physical description and acerbic manner, but not in deductive genius. He has been criticized as being a racist and [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] character, especially in the early books in the series, and gives voice to anti-[[Asian people|Asian]] sentiments. When Rohmer revived the series in 1931, Smith (who has been knighted by this time for his efforts to defeat Dr. Fu Manchu, although he would always admit that the honor was not earned by superior intellect) is an ex-Assistant Commissioner of [[Scotland Yard]]. He later accepts a position with the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]]. Several books have him placed on special assignment with the [[FBI]].\n\nActors who played Dr. Fu Manchu:\n* [[Harry Agar Lyons]] in ''[[The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu]]'' (1923) and ''The Further Mysteries of Dr. Fu-Manchu'' (1924)\n* [[Warner Oland]] in ''[[The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1929), ''[[The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1930), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]'' (1931)\n* [[Boris Karloff]] in ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' (1932)\n* [[Lou Marcelle]] in ''[[The Shadow of Fu Manchu]]'' (1939\u20131940)\n* [[Henry Brandon (actor)|Henry Brandon]] in ''[[Drums of Fu Manchu]]'' (1940)\n* [[John Carradine]] in ''Fu Manchu: The Zayat Kiss'' (1952)\n* [[Glen Gordon]] in ''[[The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu]]''  (1956)\n* [[Christopher Lee]] in ''[[The Face of Fu Manchu]]'' (1965) , ''[[The Brides of Fu Manchu]]'' (1966) , ''[[The Vengeance of Fu Manchu]]'' (1967) , ''[[The Blood of Fu Manchu]]'' (1968) , and ''[[The Castle of Fu Manchu]]'' (1969)\n* [[Peter Sellers]] in ''[[The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1980)\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] in ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' (2007)\n\nActors who played Sir Denis Nayland Smith:\n* [[Fred Paul]] in ''[[The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu]]'' (1923) and ''The Further Mysteries of Dr. Fu-Manchu'' (1924)\n* [[O.

Her real name is unknown. She was sold to the Si-Fan by Egyptian slave traders while she was still a child. Karamaneh falls in love with the narrator of the first three books in the series, Dr. Petrie. She rescues Petrie and Nayland Smith many times. Eventually, the couple are united and she wins her freedom. They marry and have a daughter, Fleurette, who figures in two later novels (''Fu Manchu's Bride'' (1933) and its sequel, ''The Trail of Fu Manchu'' (1934)). Author [[Lin Carter]] later created a son for Dr. Petrie and Karamaneh, but this character is not considered canonical.\n\n=== Fah Lo Suee ===\nDr. Fu Manchu's daughter, Fah Lo Suee, is a devious mastermind in her own right, frequently plotting to usurp her father's position in the Si-Fan and aiding his enemies both within, and outside of, the organization. Her real name is unknown; Fah Lo Suee was a childhood term of endearment. She was introduced anonymously while still a teenager in the third book in the series and plays a larger role in several of the titles of the 1930s and 1940s. She was known for a time as Koreani after being brainwashed by her father, but her memory was later restored. She is infamous for taking on false identities like her father, among them Madame Ingomar, Queen Mamaloi and Mrs. van Roorden. In film, she has been portrayed by numerous actresses over the years.

[[BBC Radio]] and Broadway investors subsequently rejected Rohmer's proposals for an original Fu Manchu radio serial and stage show during the 1940s.\n\nThe re-release of ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' in 1972 was met with protest from the [[Japanese American Citizens League]], who stated that \"the movie was offensive and demeaning to [[Asian Americans]]\".<ref>Gregory William Mank, ''Hollywood Cauldron: 13 Horror Films from the Genres's Golden Age'', McFarland, 2001 (pp.53\u201389) {{ISBN|0-7864-1112-0}}</ref> Due to this protest, CBS television decided to cancel a showing of ''[[The Vengeance of Fu Manchu]]''.

[[Fungus|fungi]] and my tiny allies, the [[Bacillus|bacilli]]&nbsp;... my black spiders\" and other peculiar animals or natural chemical weapons. He has a great respect for the truth (in fact, his word is his bond), and uses torture and other gruesome tactics to dispose of his enemies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1228548/racist-curse-fu-manchu-back-spotlight-after-chevrolet-ad|title=The racist curse of Fu Manchu back in spotlight after Chevrolet ad|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en}}</ref>\n\nDr. Fu Manchu is described as a mysterious villain because he seldom appears on the scene. He always sends his minions to commit crimes for him. In the novel ''The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu'', he sends a beautiful young girl to the crime scene to see the victim is dead. He also sends a dacoit to attack Sir Denis Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie.\n\nIn the novel ''Fu Manchu's Bride'' (1933), Dr. Fu Manchu claims to hold doctorates from four Western universities, while in ''Emperor Fu Manchu'' (1959), he states that he attended [[Heidelberg University]], the [[Sorbonne]], and the [[University of Edinburgh]] (in the film ''The Mask of Fu Manchu'', however, he states proudly that \"I am a doctor of philosophy from Edinburgh, a doctor of law from Christ's College, a doctor of medicine from Harvard. My friends, out of courtesy, call me 'Doctor' \".). At the time of their first encounter (1911), Dr. Petrie believed that Dr. Fu Manchu was more than 70 years old. This would mean he was studying for his first doctorate in the 1860s or 1870s.\n\nAccording to [[Cay Van Ash]], Rohmer's biographer and former assistant who became the first author to continue the series after Rohmer's death, \"Fu Manchu\" was a title of honor, which meant \"the warlike [[Manchu people|Manchu]]\". Van Ash speculates that Dr. Fu Manchu had been a member of the [[Qing dynasty|imperial family of China]], who had backed the losing side in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In the early books (1913\u20131917), Dr. Fu Manchu is an agent of the Chinese [[Tong (organization)|tong]] known as the Si-Fan and acts as the mastermind behind a wave of assassinations targeting Western imperialists. In the later books (1931\u20131959), he has gained control of the Si-Fan, which has been changed from a mere Chinese tong into an international criminal organization under his leadership which, in addition to attempting to take over the world and restore China to its ancient glory (Dr. Fu Manchu's main goals right from the beginning), also tries to rout [[Fascism|fascist]] dictators and then halt the spread of worldwide [[Communism]] both for its leader's own selfish reasons, Dr. Fu Manchu knowing them both to be major rivals in his plans for world domination. The Si-Fan is largely funded through criminal activities, particularly the drug trade and [[human trafficking]] (or \"white slavery\"). Dr. Fu Manchu has extended his already considerable lifespan by use of the [[elixir of life]], a formula that he had spent decades trying to perfect.\n\n====Dr. Fu Manchu's appearance/the Fu Manchu mustache====\nThe most representative part of Dr. Fu Manchu\u2019s appearance is his mustache. The mustache is also registered on dictionaries, and not only registered as Dr. Fu Manchu\u2019s mustache, but also just registered as a Fu Manchu, which shows that the mustache of Dr. Fu Manchu has become an iconic characteristic of him. The Fu Manchu/Fu Manchu mustache is described as a long, narrow mustache whose ends taper and droop down to the chin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fu_manchu|title=Fu Manchu {{!}} Definition of Fu Manchu in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n===Sir Denis Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie===\nOpposing Dr. Fu Manchu in the stories are Sir Denis Nayland Smith and, in the first three books, Dr. Petrie. They are in the [[Sherlock Holmes|Holmes]] and [[Dr. Watson|Watson]] tradition, with Petrie narrating the stories (after the third book, they would be narrated by various others allied with Smith right up to the end of the series) while Smith carries the fight, combating Dr. Fu Manchu more by sheer luck and dogged determination than intellectual brilliance (except ''in extremis''). Smith and Dr. Fu Manchu share a grudging respect for one another, as each believes that a man must keep his word, even to an enemy.\n\nIn the first three books, Smith is a colonial police commissioner in Burma granted a [[roving commission]], which allows him to exercise authority over any group that can help him in his mission. He resembles [[Sherlock Holmes]] in physical description and acerbic manner, but not in deductive genius. He has been criticized as being a racist and [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] character, especially in the early books in the series, and gives voice to anti-[[Asian people|Asian]] sentiments. When Rohmer revived the series in 1931, Smith (who has been knighted by this time for his efforts to defeat Dr. Fu Manchu, although he would always admit that the honor was not earned by superior intellect) is an ex-Assistant Commissioner of [[Scotland Yard]]. He later accepts a position with the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]]. Several books have him placed on special assignment with the [[FBI]].\n\nActors who played Dr. Fu Manchu:\n* [[Harry Agar Lyons]] in ''[[The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu]]'' (1923) and ''The Further Mysteries of Dr. Fu-Manchu'' (1924)\n* [[Warner Oland]] in ''[[The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1929), ''[[The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1930), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]'' (1931)\n* [[Boris Karloff]] in ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' (1932)\n* [[Lou Marcelle]] in ''[[The Shadow of Fu Manchu]]'' (1939\u20131940)\n* [[Henry Brandon (actor)|Henry Brandon]] in ''[[Drums of Fu Manchu]]'' (1940)\n* [[John Carradine]] in ''Fu Manchu: The Zayat Kiss'' (1952)\n* [[Glen Gordon]] in ''[[The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu]]''  (1956)\n* [[Christopher Lee]] in ''[[The Face of Fu Manchu]]'' (1965) , ''[[The Brides of Fu Manchu]]'' (1966) , ''[[The Vengeance of Fu Manchu]]'' (1967) , ''[[The Blood of Fu Manchu]]'' (1968) , and ''[[The Castle of Fu Manchu]]'' (1969)\n* [[Peter Sellers]] in ''[[The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1980)\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] in ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' (2007)\n\nActors who played Sir Denis Nayland Smith:\n* [[Fred Paul]] in ''[[The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu]]'' (1923) and ''The Further Mysteries of Dr. Fu-Manchu'' (1924)\n* [[O.

Her real name is unknown. She was sold to the Si-Fan by Egyptian slave traders while she was still a child. Karamaneh falls in love with the narrator of the first three books in the series, Dr. Petrie. She rescues Petrie and Nayland Smith many times. Eventually, the couple are united and she wins her freedom. They marry and have a daughter, Fleurette, who figures in two later novels (''Fu Manchu's Bride'' (1933) and its sequel, ''The Trail of Fu Manchu'' (1934)). Author [[Lin Carter]] later created a son for Dr. Petrie and Karamaneh, but this character is not considered canonical.\n\n=== Fah Lo Suee ===\nDr. Fu Manchu's daughter, Fah Lo Suee, is a devious mastermind in her own right, frequently plotting to usurp her father's position in the Si-Fan and aiding his enemies both within, and outside of, the organization. Her real name is unknown; Fah Lo Suee was a childhood term of endearment. She was introduced anonymously while still a teenager in the third book in the series and plays a larger role in several of the titles of the 1930s and 1940s. She was known for a time as Koreani after being brainwashed by her father, but her memory was later restored. She is infamous for taking on false identities like her father, among them Madame Ingomar, Queen Mamaloi and Mrs. van Roorden. In film, she has been portrayed by numerous actresses over the years. Her character is usually renamed in film adaptations because of difficulties with the pronunciation of her name. [[Anna May Wong]] played Ling Moy in 1931's ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]''. [[Myrna Loy]] portrayed the similarly-named Fah Lo See in 1932's ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]''. Gloria Franklin had the role of Fah Lo Suee in 1940's ''[[Drums of Fu Manchu]]''. [[Laurette Luez]] played Karamaneh in 1956's ''[[The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'', but the character owed more to Fah Lo Suee than Rohmer's depiction of Karamaneh. [[Tsai Chin (actress)|Tsai Chin]] portrayed Dr. Fu Manchu's daughter, Lin Tang, in the five [[Christopher Lee]] films of the 1960s.\n\n==Controversy==\n\n{{POV|date=May 2019}}\n{{Unbalanced|date=May 2019}}\n\nAs an ethnic fictional criminal mastermind, Dr. Fu Manchu has sparked numerous controversies of racism and \"Orientalism\", from his fiendish design to his faux Chinese name.<ref name=\"Kinkley 832\u2013833\">{{Cite journal|last=Kinkley|first=Jeffrey C.|location=New York|date=2016-12-01|title=Book review: ''The Yellow Peril: Dr. Fu Manchu and the Rise of Chinaphobia'' by Christopher Frayling|journal=Historian|language=en|volume=78|issue=#4|pages=832\u2013833|doi=10.1111/hisn.12410|issn=1540-6563}}</ref> After the release of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s film adaptation of ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' (1932), which featured the Chinese villain telling an assembled group of \"Asians\" (consisting of caricatured Indians, Persians and Arabs) that they must \"kill the white man and take his women\", the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Chinese]] embassy in Washington, D.C. issued a formal complaint against the film.<ref>[[Christopher Frayling]], quoted in \"Fu Manchu\", in [[Kim Newman|Newman, Kim]] (ed.), ''The BFI Companion to Horror''.

Likewise, Rohmer's publisher, Doubleday, refused to publish further additions to the best-selling series for the duration of [[World War II]] once the United States entered the conflict. [[BBC Radio]] and Broadway investors subsequently rejected Rohmer's proposals for an original Fu Manchu radio serial and stage show during the 1940s.\n\nThe re-release of ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' in 1972 was met with protest from the [[Japanese American Citizens League]], who stated that \"the movie was offensive and demeaning to [[Asian Americans]]\".<ref>Gregory William Mank, ''Hollywood Cauldron: 13 Horror Films from the Genres's Golden Age'', McFarland, 2001 (pp.53\u201389) {{ISBN|0-7864-1112-0}}</ref> Due to this protest, CBS television decided to cancel a showing of ''[[The Vengeance of Fu Manchu]]''.

Fred Fu Manchu, a \"famous Chinese bamboo saxophonist\", was a recurring character on ''[[The Goon Show]]'', a 1950s British radio comedy program. He was featured in the episode \"The Terrible Revenge of Fred Fu Manchu\" in 1955 (announced as \"Fred Fu Manchu and his Bamboo Saxophone\"), and made minor appearances in other episodes (including \"China Story\", \"The Siege of Fort Night\", and in \"The Lost Emperor\" as \"Doctor Fred Fu Manchu, Oriental tattooist\"). The character was created and performed by [[Spike Milligan]], who used it to mock British xenophobia and self-satisfaction, the traits that summoned the original Fu Manchu into existence, and not as a slur against Asians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.braineater.com/fu.html |title=Blood of Fu Manchu |publisher=Braineater.com |date=}}</ref> The character was further parodied in a later radio comedy, ''[[Round the Horne]]'', as Dr Chu En Ginsberg MA (failed), portrayed by [[Kenneth Williams]].\n\nIn 1977, [[Cadbury#Brands|Trebor]] produced a \"Fu Munchews\" [[Confectionery|sweet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njedge.net/~knapp/candy.htm |title=FuMunChews |publisher=Njedge.net |date=16 September 1976}}</ref>\n\nDr. Fu Manchu was parodied in the character of the Fiendish Dr. Wu in the action-comedy film ''[[Black Dynamite]]'' (2009), in which the executor of an evil plan against African-Americans is an insidious, mustache-sporting [[kung fu]] master.<ref>{{Citation|last=James St. Clair|title=Fiendish Dr. Wu|date=2011-04-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuFL8Le1Pqk|accessdate=2018-02-09}}</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* ''The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu'' (1913) (U.K. title: ''[[The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu]]'').\n* ''The Return of Dr Fu-Manchu'' (1916) (U.K. title: ''The Devil Doctor'')\n* ''The Hand of Fu-Manchu'' (1917) (U.K. title: ''The Si-Fan Mysteries'')\n* ''Daughter of Fu Manchu'' (1931)\n* ''The Mask of Fu Manchu'' (1932)\n* ''Fu Manchu's Bride'' (1933) (U.K. title: ''The Bride of Fu Manchu'')\n* ''The Trail of Fu Manchu'' (1934)\n* ''President Fu Manchu'' (1936)\n* ''The Drums of Fu Manchu'' (1939)\n* ''The Island of Fu Manchu'' (1941)\n* ''Shadow of Fu Manchu'' (1948)\n* ''Re-Enter Fu Manchu'' (1957)  (U.K. title: ''Re-Enter Dr. Fu Manchu'')\n* ''Emperor Fu Manchu'' (1959)  This was Rohmer's last novel, published before his death.\n* ''The Wrath of Fu Manchu'' (1973) was a posthumous anthology containing the title novella, first published in 1952, and three later short stories: \"The Eyes of Fu Manchu\" (1957), \"The Word of Fu Manchu\" (1958), and \"The Mind of Fu Manchu\" (1959).\n* ''Ten Years Beyond Baker Street'' (1984).

This lost University adventure of Holmes is narrated by Conan Doyle's character [[Reginald Musgrave]].\n\nDr. Fu Manchu also made appearances in the following non-''Fu Manchu'' books:\n* \"Sex Slaves of the Dragon Tong\" and \"Part of the Game\" are a pair of related short stories by [[F. Paul Wilson]] appearing in his collection ''Aftershocks and Others: 19 Oddities'' (2009) and feature anonymous appearances by Dr. Fu Manchu and characters from ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]''.\n* Dr. Fu Manchu appears under the name \"the Doctor\" in several stories in [[August Derleth]]'s [[Solar Pons]] detective series. Derleth's successor, [[Basil Copper]], also made use of the character.\n* Dr. Fu Manchu is the name of the Chinese ambassador in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Slapstick (novel)|Slapstick]]'' (1976).\n* It is revealed that Chiun, the Master of [[Sinanju (martial art)|Sinanju]] has worked for the Devil Doctor, as have previous generations of Masters, in ''[[The Destroyer (novel series)|The Destroyer]]'' #83, ''Skull Duggery''.\n* Dr. Fu Manchu also appears in the background to [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s ''[[Rivers of London (novel)|Rivers of London]]'' series. In this depiction, Dr. Fu Manchu was a charlatan and con man rather than a supervillain and in fact he was a Canadian married to a Chinese wife and only pretending to be Chinese himself; the grand criminal schemes attributed to him were mere myths, concocted either by himself or by the sensationalist press and publicity-seeking police officers, the latter partly motivated by anti-Chinese prejudice.\n\n== In other media ==\n\n{{in popular culture|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Film ===\nDr. Fu Manchu first appeared on the big screen in the British silent film series ''The Mystery of Dr. Fu Manchu'' (1923) starring [[Harry Agar Lyons]] as Dr. Fu Manchu, a series of 15 short feature films, each running around 20 minutes. Lyons returned to the role in ''The Further Mysteries of Dr. Fu Manchu'' (1924), which comprised eight additional short feature films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/503748/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Mystery of Dr Fu Manchu, The (1923)|work=screenonline.org.uk}}</ref><ref>Workman, Christopher; Howarth, Troy (2016). \"Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era\".

Oland repeated the role in ''[[The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1930) and ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]'' (1931) as well as in the short film ''Murder Will Out'' (part of the omnibus film ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'') in which Dr. Fu Manchu confronts both [[Philo Vance]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe most controversial incarnation of the character was MGM's ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' (1932) starring [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Myrna Loy]]. At the time of its first release, the film was considered racist and offensive by representatives of the Chinese government. The film was suppressed for many years, but has been released on DVD uncut.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nDr. Fu Manchu returned to the serial format in Republic Pictures' ''[[Drums of Fu Manchu]]'' (1940), a 15-episode serial considered to be one of the best the studio ever made.

Towers and Lee would make five Dr. Fu Manchu films through to the end of the decade: ''[[The Face of Fu Manchu]]'' (1965), ''[[The Brides of Fu Manchu]]'' (1966), ''[[The Vengeance of Fu Manchu]]'' (1967), ''[[The Blood of Fu Manchu]]'' (1968), and ''[[The Castle of Fu Manchu]]'' (1969).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/503646/index.html|title=BFI Screenonline: Face of Fu Manchu, The (1965)|work=screenonline.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe character's last authorized film appearance was in the [[Peter Sellers]] spoof ''[[The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1980), with Sellers featured in a double role as both Dr. Fu Manchu and Nayland Smith. The film bore little resemblance to any prior film or the original books. In the film, Dr. Fu Manchu claims he was known as \"Fred\" at public school, a reference to the character of \"The Terrible Revenge of Fred Fu Manchu\" from a 1955 episode of ''[[The Goon Show]]'' which had co-starred Sellers.<ref>p. 210, Lewis, Roger, ''The Life and Death of Peter Sellers'', Random House 1995</ref>\n\n[[Jess Franco]], who had directed ''[[The Blood of Fu Manchu]]'' and ''[[The Castle of Fu Manchu]]'', also directed ''[[The Girl From Rio]]'', the second of three [[Harry Alan Towers]] films based on Rohmer's female Dr. Fu Manchu-like character, [[Sumuru (character)|Sumuru]].

NBC turned it down without broadcasting it, but it has been screened at special events.\n\nThe television arm of [[Republic Pictures]] produced a 13-episode syndicated series ''[[The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1956), starring [[Glen Gordon]] as Dr. Fu Manchu, [[Lester Matthews]] as Sir Denis Nayland Smith, and [[Clark Howat]] as Dr. John Petrie. The title sequence depicted Smith and Dr. Fu Manchu in a game of chess as the announcer stated that \"the devil is said to play for men's souls. So does Dr. Fu Manchu, evil incarnate.\" At the conclusion of each episode, after Nayland Smith and Petrie had foiled Dr. Fu Manchu's latest fiendish scheme, Dr. Fu Manchu would be seen breaking a black chess piece in a fit of frustration (black king's bishop, always the same scene, repeated) just before the closing credits rolled. It was directed by [[Franklin Adreon]], as well as [[William Witney]]. Dr. Fu Manchu was never allowed to succeed in this TV series. Unlike the Holmes/Watson type relationship of the films, the series featured Smith as a law enforcement officer and Petrie as a staff member for the [[Surgeon-General (United Kingdom)|Surgeon-General]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n=== Music ===\n* American stoner rock band [[Fu Manchu (band)|Fu Manchu]] was formed in Southern California in 1985.\n* [[Desmond Dekker]] had a 1969 reggae song titled \"Fu Man Chu\".\n* The [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] song \"Moustache\" from the 1982 album ''[[Angst in My Pants]]'' includes a lyric \"My Fu Manchu was real fine\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/8830275}}</ref>\n* [[The Rockin' Ramrods]] had a 1965 song titled \"Don't Fool With Fu Manchu\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2oUnuohuEE|date=10 April 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Quebec]] [[Rock music|rock]] singer [[Robert Charlebois]] included an epic three-part song titled \"Fu Man Chu\" on his 1972 album ''Charlebois''.\n* Russian hardbass artist XS Project has a song named \"Fu Manchu\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/xsproject/fu-manchu}}</ref>\n* American country music singer Tim McGraw published a song called \"Live Like You Were Dying\".

This destroyed their stored [[maize]] and other foods, added to their loss of life, and threatened their future, as they had no way to survive the winter. The attacks likely forced their emigration. The Iroquois League was known for adopting captives and refugees into their tribes. The surviving Erie are believed to have been largely absorbed by other Iroquoian tribes, particularly families of the [[Seneca people|Seneca]], the westernmost of the Five Nations.  [[Susquehannock]] families may also have adopted some Erie, as the tribes had shared the hunting grounds of the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and [[Kittanning Path|Amerindian paths]] that passed through the [[gaps of the Allegheny]]. The members of remnant tribes living among the Iroquois gradually assimilated to the majority cultures, losing their independent tribal identities.<ref>According to ''The American Heritage Book of Indians'' the [[Susquehannock]] were poised to wipe out the Iroquois after administering severe drubbings into 1668, only to be laid low by multi-year disease [[epidemics]] in 1669-1671. By 1672-1673 they were beset on all sides and, like the Erie, went extinct as a tribe because of their high mortality rate. Their small percentage of survivors had to disperse among kindred tribes. The Iroquois adopted their remnants under the terms of a formal treaty in 1678. Some of the Susquehannock fleeing during 1676 triggered [[Bacon's Rebellion]] in the south.<!-- How? --></ref>\n\nThe Erie were also called the ''Chat'' (\"Cat\" in French) or \"Long Tail\" (referring, possibly, to the raccoon tails worn on clothing or the Eastern Panther which played a role in Erie cosmology). Like all the Iroquoian stock, they lived in multi-family [[long house]]s in villages enclosed in [[palisade]]s. These defensive works often encompassed their fields for crops. They cultivated the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|\"Three Sisters\"]]: varieties of [[maize|corn]], [[beans]], and [[squash (fruit)|squash]], during the warm season. In winter, tribal members lived off the stored crops and animals taken in hunts.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Carte Nouvelle-france et 13 colonies en 1710.jpg|thumb|Elements of Erie shown in the general area of the Upper Ohio Valley.<br>Clip from John Senex map ca 1710 showing the people Captain Vielle passed (1692\u201394) by to arrive in Chaouenon's country, as the French Jesuit called the Shawnee]]\nWhile [[indigenous peoples]] lived along the [[Great Lakes]] for thousands of years in succeeding cultures, historic tribes known at the time of European encounter began to coalesce by the 15th and 16th centuries. The Erie were among the several [[Iroquois|Iroquoian peoples]] sharing a similar culture, tribal organization, and speaking an [[Iroquoian language]] which emerged around the Great Lakes, but with elements that may have originated in the south.{{efn\n |In Virginia, visiting Susquehannocks were described by an admiring Captain John Smith. Further, [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] and [[Cherokee]] lived in the south from before Jamestown was founded, and the powerful Susquehanna had a lock on the Susquehanna basin into the upper [[Chesapeake Bay]] shores, probably into the northern [[Shenandoah Valley]]. The editors of ''New American Heritage'' state the various confederacies of Iroquoian tribes migrated from south to the [[Great Lakes]] regions and in between well before pre-Columbian times. Conversely, others such as the editors of the 1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' suggest the tribes originated in what became Algonkian territories along the Saint Lawrence and moved west and south when the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes moved north up the coast and spread west. By the time of European encounter, Algonquian and Iroquoian tribes were competitive, although they were known to conduct trading and spent most years in uneasy peace. Separation between tribes living in wilderness ensured contacts were mainly small affairs before the use fire arms tipped the balance of warfare to enhance the killing ability of a people who could not out run a bullet, a limitation which existed before guns and the ability to kill at range.\n}} Traditional rivalries and habitual competition among Amerindian tribes for resources (especially [[fire arms]]) and power was escalated by the lucrative returns of the [[fur trade]] with French and Dutch colonists beginning settlements in the greater area before 1611.  Violence to control the fur-bearing territories, the beginnings of the long-running  [[Beaver Wars]], began early in the 17th century{{efn\n |Beaver Wars are usually blamed upon the Iroquois who were believed to have a joint population dwarfed by surrounding tribes.\n }} so the normal peace and trading activity decreased between the tribes, who had responded to demand for beaver and other furs by over-hunting some areas.\n\nThe Erie encroached on territory which other tribes considered theirs.<ref name=DS-com>[http://www.dickshovel.com/erie.html ERIE HISTORY], \"The Erie needed beaver for this trade and probably encroached on other tribal territories to get it. The result was a war with an unknown Algonquin enemy in 1635 that forced the Erie to abandon some of their western villages.\", 2016-0612.</ref> During 1651,<ref name=DS-com/> they'd angered their eastern neighbors, the Iroquois League, by accepting Huron [[refugee]]s from villages which had been destroyed by the Iroquois. Though reported as using poison-tipped arrows (''[[Jesuit Relations]]'' 41:43, 1655\u201358 chap. XI), the Erie were disadvantaged in armed conflict with the Iroquois because they had few [[firearm]]s.<ref name=DS-com/>{{efn \n |If the Erie tribe had used poison on their arrows, they would have been the only tribe in North America to do so.<ref>Tooker 1978 and Snyderman 1948, \"doubts poisoned arrows\". Anthony P. Schiavo, Claudio R. Salvucci, ''Iroquois Wars: Extracts from the Jesuit Relations and Primary Sources'', p.11 {{ISBN|1-889758-37-X}}</ref>\n}}  By the mid-1650s, the Erie became a broken tribe&mdash; beginning in 1653<ref name=\"AmHeritageBk\"/> the Erie launched a preemptive attack on western tribes of the Iroquois, and did well in the first year of a five-year war.<ref name=\"AmHeritageBk\"/>\n \nConsequently, in 1654 the whole Iroquois Confederacy went to war against the Erie and neighboring tribes such as the [[Neutral Nation|Neutral people]] along the northern shores of [[Lake Erie]] and across the [[Niagara River]], the [[Tabacco people]] between the Erie and Iroquois, neighbors to all three groups. As a result, over five years of war they destroyed the Erie confederacy, the Neutrals, the Tobacco, with the tribes surviving in remnants. Dispersed groups survived a few more decades before being absorbed into the Iroquois, especially the westernmost Seneca nation.\n\n[[Anthropologist]] Marvin T. Smith ([[#refSmith1987|1986:131\u201332]]) theorized that some Erie fled to [[Virginia]] and then [[South Carolina]], where they became known as the ''[[Westo]]''. Some were said to flee to [[Canada]]. Members of other tribes claimed later to be descended from refugees of this defunct culture, who intermarried with other peoples. Among those are members of the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] people in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Kansas]].\n\nBecause the Erie were located further from the coastal areas of early European exploration, they had little direct contact with Europeans. Only the [[New Netherlands|Dutch]] fur traders from [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]] (now [[Albany, New York]]) and Jesuit missionaries in Canada referred to them in historic records.

This destroyed their stored [[maize]] and other foods, added to their loss of life, and threatened their future, as they had no way to survive the winter. The attacks likely forced their emigration. The Iroquois League was known for adopting captives and refugees into their tribes. The surviving Erie are believed to have been largely absorbed by other Iroquoian tribes, particularly families of the [[Seneca people|Seneca]], the westernmost of the Five Nations.  [[Susquehannock]] families may also have adopted some Erie, as the tribes had shared the hunting grounds of the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and [[Kittanning Path|Amerindian paths]] that passed through the [[gaps of the Allegheny]]. The members of remnant tribes living among the Iroquois gradually assimilated to the majority cultures, losing their independent tribal identities.<ref>According to ''The American Heritage Book of Indians'' the [[Susquehannock]] were poised to wipe out the Iroquois after administering severe drubbings into 1668, only to be laid low by multi-year disease [[epidemics]] in 1669-1671. By 1672-1673 they were beset on all sides and, like the Erie, went extinct as a tribe because of their high mortality rate. Their small percentage of survivors had to disperse among kindred tribes. The Iroquois adopted their remnants under the terms of a formal treaty in 1678. Some of the Susquehannock fleeing during 1676 triggered [[Bacon's Rebellion]] in the south.<!-- How? --></ref>\n\nThe Erie were also called the ''Chat'' (\"Cat\" in French) or \"Long Tail\" (referring, possibly, to the raccoon tails worn on clothing or the Eastern Panther which played a role in Erie cosmology). Like all the Iroquoian stock, they lived in multi-family [[long house]]s in villages enclosed in [[palisade]]s. These defensive works often encompassed their fields for crops. They cultivated the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|\"Three Sisters\"]]: varieties of [[maize|corn]], [[beans]], and [[squash (fruit)|squash]], during the warm season. In winter, tribal members lived off the stored crops and animals taken in hunts.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Carte Nouvelle-france et 13 colonies en 1710.jpg|thumb|Elements of Erie shown in the general area of the Upper Ohio Valley.<br>Clip from John Senex map ca 1710 showing the people Captain Vielle passed (1692\u201394) by to arrive in Chaouenon's country, as the French Jesuit called the Shawnee]]\nWhile [[indigenous peoples]] lived along the [[Great Lakes]] for thousands of years in succeeding cultures, historic tribes known at the time of European encounter began to coalesce by the 15th and 16th centuries. The Erie were among the several [[Iroquois|Iroquoian peoples]] sharing a similar culture, tribal organization, and speaking an [[Iroquoian language]] which emerged around the Great Lakes, but with elements that may have originated in the south.{{efn\n |In Virginia, visiting Susquehannocks were described by an admiring Captain John Smith. Further, [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] and [[Cherokee]] lived in the south from before Jamestown was founded, and the powerful Susquehanna had a lock on the Susquehanna basin into the upper [[Chesapeake Bay]] shores, probably into the northern [[Shenandoah Valley]]. The editors of ''New American Heritage'' state the various confederacies of Iroquoian tribes migrated from south to the [[Great Lakes]] regions and in between well before pre-Columbian times. Conversely, others such as the editors of the 1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' suggest the tribes originated in what became Algonkian territories along the Saint Lawrence and moved west and south when the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes moved north up the coast and spread west. By the time of European encounter, Algonquian and Iroquoian tribes were competitive, although they were known to conduct trading and spent most years in uneasy peace. Separation between tribes living in wilderness ensured contacts were mainly small affairs before the use fire arms tipped the balance of warfare to enhance the killing ability of a people who could not out run a bullet, a limitation which existed before guns and the ability to kill at range.\n}} Traditional rivalries and habitual competition among Amerindian tribes for resources (especially [[fire arms]]) and power was escalated by the lucrative returns of the [[fur trade]] with French and Dutch colonists beginning settlements in the greater area before 1611.  Violence to control the fur-bearing territories, the beginnings of the long-running  [[Beaver Wars]], began early in the 17th century{{efn\n |Beaver Wars are usually blamed upon the Iroquois who were believed to have a joint population dwarfed by surrounding tribes.\n }} so the normal peace and trading activity decreased between the tribes, who had responded to demand for beaver and other furs by over-hunting some areas.\n\nThe Erie encroached on territory which other tribes considered theirs.<ref name=DS-com>[http://www.dickshovel.com/erie.html ERIE HISTORY], \"The Erie needed beaver for this trade and probably encroached on other tribal territories to get it.

Though reported as using poison-tipped arrows (''[[Jesuit Relations]]'' 41:43, 1655\u201358 chap. XI), the Erie were disadvantaged in armed conflict with the Iroquois because they had few [[firearm]]s.<ref name=DS-com/>{{efn \n |If the Erie tribe had used poison on their arrows, they would have been the only tribe in North America to do so.<ref>Tooker 1978 and Snyderman 1948, \"doubts poisoned arrows\".

As a result, over five years of war they destroyed the Erie confederacy, the Neutrals, the Tobacco, with the tribes surviving in remnants. Dispersed groups survived a few more decades before being absorbed into the Iroquois, especially the westernmost Seneca nation.\n\n[[Anthropologist]] Marvin T. Smith ([[#refSmith1987|1986:131\u201332]]) theorized that some Erie fled to [[Virginia]] and then [[South Carolina]], where they became known as the ''[[Westo]]''. Some were said to flee to [[Canada]]. Members of other tribes claimed later to be descended from refugees of this defunct culture, who intermarried with other peoples. Among those are members of the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] people in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Kansas]].\n\nBecause the Erie were located further from the coastal areas of early European exploration, they had little direct contact with Europeans. Only the [[New Netherlands|Dutch]] fur traders from [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]] (now [[Albany, New York]]) and Jesuit missionaries in Canada referred to them in historic records.
