{"title_page": "List of International Rules Series results", "text_new": "The '''[[International Rules Series]]''' is a senior men's competition played under the laws of [[international rules football]], a hybrid sport combining elements of [[Gaelic football]] and [[Australian rules football]]. The series is overseen by the two sports' governing bodies, the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] and [[Australian Football League]]. This page lists results of each test match in the series. Click on the a series year for a more detailed recording of results.\n\n==Results==\nThough the first [[Australian Football World Tour]] took place in 1967, it wasn't until 1984 that the first organised series sanctioned by the two governing bodies occurred. The four series that took place from 1984 to 1990 featured three test matches each, with the winning nation being the one to secure at least two victories. Since 1998 each series has been played over two matches, with the winning nation being the one to score the highest amount on aggregate over the two tests. This excludes the 2014 and 2015 series, which were both one-off matches.\n\nScores are given in the form [''goals''] [''overs''] [''behinds''] ([''points'']). A goal equals 6 points, an over 3, and a behind 1. So 2.9.7 (46) means 2 goals, 9 overs and 7 behinds; 2(6) + 9(3) + 7(1) = 12 + 27 + 7 = 46 points in total.\n \n{{S-start}}\n|- style=\";background:#ccf;font-size: 85%\" \n| {{Tooltip|'''#'''|Test match number}}\n| '''Series'''\n| '''Date'''\n| '''Home Nation'''\n| {{Tooltip|'''Score'''|Goals \u2013 Overs \u2013 Behinds (Total)}}\n| '''Away Nation'''\n| {{Tooltip|'''Score'''|Goals \u2013 Overs \u2013 Behinds (Total)}}\n| '''Ground'''\n| '''Crowd'''\n| {{Tooltip|'''Agg.'''|Winning aggregate margin}}\n| '''Series Winner'''\n|{{Tooltip|'''H2H'''|Head to head test match count}}\n|- style=\"background:#fff;font-size: 85%;\"\n| ''1''\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"|[[1984 International Rules Series|1984]]\n| 21/10\n| [[Ireland international rules football team|Ireland]]\n| 4.8.9 (57)\n| style=\"background:#cfc;\"| '''[[Australia international rules football team|Australia]]'''\n| style=\"background:#cfc;\"| '''2.15.13 (70)'''\n| [[P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh]]\n| 8,000\n| rowspan=\"3\"|+14\n| rowspan=\"3\"!div style=\"background:Navy;

The series is overseen by the two sports' governing bodies, the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] and [[Australian Football League]]. This page lists results of each test match in the series. Click on the a series year for a more detailed recording of results.\n\n==Results==\nThough the first [[Australian Football World Tour]] took place in 1967, it wasn't until 1984 that the first organised series sanctioned by the two governing bodies occurred. The four series that took place from 1984 to 1990 featured three test matches each, with the winning nation being the one to secure at least two victories. Since 1998 each series has been played over two matches, with the winning nation being the one to score the highest amount on aggregate over the two tests. This excludes the 2014 and 2015 series, which were both one-off matches.\n\nScores are given in the form [''goals''] [''overs''] [''behinds''] ([''points'']). A goal equals 6 points, an over 3, and a behind 1. So 2.9.7 (46) means 2 goals, 9 overs and 7 behinds; 2(6) + 9(3) + 7(1) = 12 + 27 + 7 = 46 points in total.\n \n{{S-start}}\n|- style=\";background:#ccf;font-size: 85%\" \n| {{Tooltip|'''#'''|Test match number}}\n| '''Series'''\n| '''Date'''\n| '''Home Nation'''\n| {{Tooltip|'''Score'''|Goals \u2013 Overs \u2013 Behinds (Total)}}\n| '''Away Nation'''\n| {{Tooltip|'''Score'''|Goals \u2013 Overs \u2013 Behinds (Total)}}\n| '''Ground'''\n| '''Crowd'''\n| {{Tooltip|'''Agg.'''|Winning aggregate margin}}\n| '''Series Winner'''\n|{{Tooltip|'''H2H'''|Head to head test match count}}\n|- style=\"background:#fff;font-size: 85%;\"\n| ''1''\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"|[[1984 International Rules Series|1984]]\n| 21/10\n| [[Ireland international rules football team|Ireland]]\n| 4.8.9 (57)\n| style=\"background:#cfc;\"| '''[[Australia international rules football team|Australia]]'''\n| style=\"background:#cfc;\"| '''2.15.13 (70)'''\n| [[P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh]]\n| 8,000\n| rowspan=\"3\"|+14\n| rowspan=\"3\"!div style=\"background:Navy;

Green was clerk of the Texas Supreme Court until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when he became a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] cavalry leader. After winning several victories, including the Battle of Valverde and the recapture of [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], he was promoted brigadier and assigned command of the cavalry division of the [[Trans-Mississippi Department]]. In the [[Red River Campaign]], he was mortally wounded while charging a fleet of Federal gunboats. The Union naval commander [[David Dixon Porter]] paid tribute to Green as a serious loss to the Confederacy.\n\n==Early life and career==\nGreen was born in [[Buckingham County, Virginia|Buckingham County]] in [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]] to Nathan and Mary (Field) Green. The family moved to [[Tennessee]] in 1817. He attended [[Jackson College (Tennessee)|Jackson College]] and [[Cumberland College (Princeton, Kentucky)]] before he received a degree from the [[University of Tennessee]] at [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] in 1834. He then studied law with his father, who was a judge on the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]].\n\nWhen the [[Texas Revolution]] began, Green left Tennessee to join the rebel volunteers. He arrived in [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]] in December 1835, and enlisted in Isaac N. Moreland's company on January 14, 1836. During the April 21 [[Battle of San Jacinto]], Green helped operate the famed \"[[Twin Sisters (cannons)|Twin Sisters]]\" [[cannon]]s, the only artillery present in [[Sam Houston]]'s army. A few days after the decisive victory, Houston rewarded Green with a commission as a lieutenant. In early May, he was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] and assigned as the ''[[aide-de-camp]] ''to General [[Thomas J. Rusk]]. With hostilities over, Green resigned on May 30 and returned to Tennessee to resume studying law.\n\nIn 1837, the legislature of the new [[Republic of Texas]] granted large tracts of land to leading veterans of the Revolution, including Green. After relocating to [[Fayette County, Texas|Fayette County]], Green became a county surveyor at [[La Grange, Texas|La Grange]]. That same year, fellow San Jacinto veteran William W. Gant nominated Green for the position of engrossing clerk for the [[Texas House of Representatives]]. He was subsequently elected and held the office until 1839 when he represented Fayette County in the House of Representatives in the Fourth Texas Congress. After a single term, he chose not to run again and resumed his clerkship. During the Sixth and Eighth Texas Congresses, he served as secretary of the Senate. From 1841 to 1861, he was clerk of the Texas Supreme Court, in both the republic and the subsequent U.S. state.\n\nDuring his legislative career, Green continued his involvement with Texas's military.  He participated in [[John Henry Moore (Texas)|John H. Moore's]] 1840 campaign against the [[Comanche]]s up the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]]. When Mexican general [[R\u00e1fael V\u00e1squez (Mexican general)|R\u00e1fael V\u00e1squez]] briefly occupied San Antonio in March 1842, Green recruited the Travis County Volunteers and stood as their captain; the unit was not involved in combat.

This kind of respirator is reusable, with the filters being replaced periodically.]]\n\nA '''respirator''' is a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous atmospheres, including [[particulate matter]] such as dusts and airborne microorganisms, as well as hazardous fumes, vapours and gases. There are two main categories: the ''air-purifying respirator'' in which respirable air is obtained by filtering a contaminated atmosphere, and the ''air-supplied respirator'' in which an alternate supply of breathable air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contaminants.\n\nAir-purifying respirators range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable face masks sometimes referred to as a [[dust mask]] to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges often called a [[gas mask]].\n\n==Physical form==\n[[File:NIOSH P95 cross section.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Cross-section of [[NIOSH air filtration rating|NIOSH-approved]] P95 filters used in [[metalworking]] operations. Even \"clean\" industrial processes often generate large amounts of harmful particulate matter and require breathing protection.]]\nAll respirators have some type of facepiece held to the wearer's head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method.  Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes, to accommodate all types of face shapes. The differences in respirator design impact the [[respirator assigned protection factors]], i.e. the resulting degree of protection which kind of hazard.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThere are three categories of particulate respirators: particulate filtering facepiece respirators are discarded when they become unsuitable for further use due to considerations of hygiene, excessive resistance, or physical damage; Elastomeric respirators are reusable because the facepiece is cleaned and reused, but the filter cartridges are discarded and replaced when they become unsuitable for further use; and [[Powered air-purifying respirator|powered air-purifying respirators]] have a battery-powered blower that moves the airflow through the filters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource1quest1.html|title=Respirator Trusted-Source Information: What are they?|last=|first=|date=2018-01-29|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nRespirators can also have half-face forms that covers the bottom half of the face including the nose and mouth, and full-face forms that cover the entire face. Half-face respirators can only be worn in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area. For example, someone who is painting an object with spray paint could wear a half-face respirator, but someone who works with [[chlorine]] gas would have to wear a full-face respirator.\n\n== Types of filtration ==\n\n=== Air-purifying ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Personal protective equipment]] -->\n[[File:Police officer wearing half-mask respirator.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Protective P100 filter mask worn by NYPD officer]]\nAir-purifying respirators are used against particulates, gases, and vapors that are at atmospheric concentrations less than immediately dangerous to life and health. This includes:\n\n*[[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative-pressure]] respirators using mechanical filters and chemical media\n*[[positive pressure|positive-pressure]] units such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)\n*Escape Only respirators or hoods such as Air-Purifying Escape Respirators for use by the general public for [[chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear]]  (CBRN) terrorism incidents.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFull hood, half- or full-facepiece designs are marketed in many varieties depending on the hazard of concern using an [[air filter]] which acts passively on air inhaled by the wearer. Two common examples of this type of respirator are single-use escape hoods and filter masks. The latter are typically simple, light, single-piece, half-face masks and employ the first three mechanical filter mechanisms in the list below to remove particulates from the air stream.  The most common of these is the disposable white N95 variety. It is discarded after single use or some extended period depending on the contaminant. Filter masks also come in replaceable-cartridge, multiple-use models. Typically one or two cartridges attach securely to a mask which has built into it a corresponding number of valves for inhalation and one for exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) and the [[International Safety Equipment Association]] (ISEA) established the American National Standard for Air-Purifying Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices to define both test criteria and approval methods for fire/smoke escape hoods. ANSI/ISEA Standard 110 provides design guidance to manufacturers of Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices (RPED) in the form of performance requirements and testing procedures. The standard covers certification, ISO registration for the manufacturer, associated test methods, labeling, conditioning requirements, independent process and quality control audits, and follow-up inspection programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://safetyequipment.org/c/std110-2009.cfm |title=International Safety Equipment Association |publisher=Safetyequipment.org |accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> ANSI/ISEA 110 was prepared by members of the ISEA RPED group, in consultation with testing laboratories and was reviewed by a consensus panel representing users, health and safety professionals and government representatives.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission uses ANSI/ISEA 110 as the benchmark in their testing of fire escape masks.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n====Mechanical filter====\nMechanical filter respirators retain particulate matter such as dust created during [[woodwork]]ing or metal processing, when contaminated air is passed through the filter material. Wool is still used today as a filter, along with plastic, glass, cellulose, and combinations of two or more of these materials. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[File:Atemluftfilter Einwegmaske.jpg|thumb|Filtering half mask with exhalation valve (class: FFP3)]]\n\nMechanical filters remove contaminants from air in the following ways:\n\n# by ''interception'' when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it;\n# by ''impaction'', when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity\n# by an enhancing mechanism called ''diffusion'', where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100&nbsp;nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter; this effect is similar to [[Brownian motion]] and increases the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the two mechanisms above; it becomes dominant at lower air flow velocities\n# by using certain resins, waxes, and plastics as coatings on the filter material to attract particles with an [[electrostatic charge]] that holds them on the filter surface;\n# by using gravity and allowing particles to settle into the filter material (this effect is typically negligible); and\n# by using the particles themselves, after the filter has been used, to act as a filter medium for other particles.\n\t\nConsidering only particulates carried on an air stream and a fiber mesh filter, diffusion predominates below the 0.1 \u03bcm diameter particle size. Impaction and interception predominate above 0.4 \u03bcm. In between, near the 0.3 \u03bcm most penetrating particle size, diffusion and interception predominate.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFor maximum efficiency of particle removal and to decrease resistance to airflow through the filter, particulate filters are designed to keep the velocity of air flow through the filter as low as possible. This is achieved by manipulating the slope and shape of the filter to provide larger surface area.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nA substantial advance in mechanical filter technology was{{when|date=March 2017}} the [[HEPA]] filter. A HEPA filter can remove as much as 99.97% of all airborne particulates with aerodynamic diameter of 0.3 \u03bcm, particles both smaller and larger are removed with an efficiency >99.97%.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-136/pdfs/2003-136.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2003136|title=Guidance for Filtration and Air-Cleaning Systems to Protect Building Environments from Airborne Chemical, Biological, or Radiological Attacks|publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|date=April 2003|isbn=|location=Cincinnati, OH|pages=8\u201312|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2003136|access-date=February 9, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] defines the following categories of particulate filters according to their [[NIOSH air filtration rating]] as of 2011:<ref name=\"fact sheet\">{{cite journal| last1 = Metzler | first1 = R| last2 = Szalajda | first2 = J | title = NIOSH Fact Sheet: NIOSH Approval Labels - Key Information to Protect Yourself | journal = DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2011-179 | year = 2011 | url =https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-179/pdfs/2011-179.pdf | issn =0343-6993}}</ref>\n\n[[File:What it Means to be NIOSH-Approved - A look into N95 Certification Testing.webm|thumb|right|300px|A video describing N95 certification testing]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There are different units for different environments. The units consist of a powered [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] which forces incoming air through one or more [[filter (air)|filter]]s to the user for breathing. The fan and filters may be carried by the user or they may be remotely mounted and the user breathes the air through tubing.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe filter type must be matched to the contaminants that need to be removed. Some PAPR's are designed to remove fine particulate matter, while others are suitable for working with [[volatile organic compound]]s as those in [[spray paint]]s. These must have their filter elements replaced more often than a particulate filter.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)===\n{{Main|Self-contained breathing apparatus}}\n\nA self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) typically has three main components: a high-pressure air cylinder (e.g., 2200 psi to 4500 psi), a pressure gauge and regulator, and an inhalation connection (mouthpiece, mouth mask or full face mask), connected together and mounted to a carrying frame or a harness with adjustable shoulder straps and belt so it can be worn on the back. There are two kinds of SCBA: open circuit and closed circuit. Most modern SCBAs are open-circuit. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOpen-circuit industrial breathing sets are filled with filtered, compressed air. The compressed air passes through a regulator, is inhaled and exhaled out of the circuit, quickly depleting the supply of air. Air cylinders are made of aluminum, steel, or of a composite construction like fiberglass-wrapped aluminum. The \"positive pressure\" type is common, which supplies a steady stream of air to stop fumes or smoke from leaking into the mask. Other SCBA's are of the \"demand\" type, which only supply air when the regulator senses the user inhaling. All fire departments and those working in toxic environments use the positive pressure SCBA for safety reasons.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe closed-circuit type SCBA filters, supplements, and recirculates exhaled gas like a [[rebreather]]. It is used when a longer-duration supply of breathing gas is needed, such as in mine rescue and in long tunnels, and going through passages too narrow for a large open-circuit air cylinder.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Industries using respirators==\nA wide range of industries use respirators including healthcare & pharmaceuticals, defense & public safety services (defense, firefighting & law enforcement), oil and gas industries, manufacturing (automotive, chemical, metal fabrication, food and beverage, wood working, paper and pulp), mining, construction, agriculture and forestry, cement production, power generation, shipbuilding and the textile industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/osh/os/osnr0014.txt|title=Respirator use and practices|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Correct usage ==\n[[File:Protection Factors of filtering facepiece, measured in real time during work.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Workplace protection factor (PF)]] of filtering facepiece, measured in real time with two optical dust meters.

Quantitative fit testing typically uses a specially prepared respirator with an inserted probe. The respirator is donned, and aerosol concentrations inside and outside of the mask are compared and used to determine a numerical fit factor. Typical room atmosphere contains sufficient particulates to perform the test, but aerosol generators can be used to improve the test accuracy\n\n=== Contrast with surgical mask ===\n[[File:Understanding_the_difference_between_surgical_masks_and_N95_respirators.pdf|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Understanding_the_difference_between_surgical_masks_and_N95_respirators.pdf|alt=A table listing the attributes of surgical masks and N95 respirators in eight categories|thumb|An infographic on the difference between [[Surgical mask|surgical masks]] and [[NIOSH air filtration rating|N95]] respirators]]\n\nA [[surgical mask]] is a loose-fitting, disposable device that creates a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment.

This kind of respirator is reusable, with the filters being replaced periodically.]]\n\nA '''respirator''' is a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous atmospheres, including [[particulate matter]] such as dusts and airborne microorganisms, as well as hazardous fumes, vapours and gases. There are two main categories: the ''air-purifying respirator'' in which respirable air is obtained by filtering a contaminated atmosphere, and the ''air-supplied respirator'' in which an alternate supply of breathable air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contaminants.\n\nAir-purifying respirators range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable face masks sometimes referred to as a [[dust mask]] to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges often called a [[gas mask]].\n\n==Physical form==\n[[File:NIOSH P95 cross section.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Cross-section of [[NIOSH air filtration rating|NIOSH-approved]] P95 filters used in [[metalworking]] operations. Even \"clean\" industrial processes often generate large amounts of harmful particulate matter and require breathing protection.]]\nAll respirators have some type of facepiece held to the wearer's head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method.  Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes, to accommodate all types of face shapes. The differences in respirator design impact the [[respirator assigned protection factors]], i.e. the resulting degree of protection which kind of hazard.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThere are three categories of particulate respirators: particulate filtering facepiece respirators are discarded when they become unsuitable for further use due to considerations of hygiene, excessive resistance, or physical damage; Elastomeric respirators are reusable because the facepiece is cleaned and reused, but the filter cartridges are discarded and replaced when they become unsuitable for further use; and [[Powered air-purifying respirator|powered air-purifying respirators]] have a battery-powered blower that moves the airflow through the filters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource1quest1.html|title=Respirator Trusted-Source Information: What are they?|last=|first=|date=2018-01-29|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nRespirators can also have half-face forms that covers the bottom half of the face including the nose and mouth, and full-face forms that cover the entire face. Half-face respirators can only be worn in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area. For example, someone who is painting an object with spray paint could wear a half-face respirator, but someone who works with [[chlorine]] gas would have to wear a full-face respirator.\n\n== Types of filtration ==\n\n=== Air-purifying ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Personal protective equipment]] -->\n[[File:Police officer wearing half-mask respirator.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Protective P100 filter mask worn by NYPD officer]]\nAir-purifying respirators are used against particulates, gases, and vapors that are at atmospheric concentrations less than immediately dangerous to life and health. This includes:\n\n*[[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative-pressure]] respirators using mechanical filters and chemical media\n*[[positive pressure|positive-pressure]] units such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs)\n*Escape Only respirators or hoods such as Air-Purifying Escape Respirators for use by the general public for [[chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear]]  (CBRN) terrorism incidents.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nFull hood, half- or full-facepiece designs are marketed in many varieties depending on the hazard of concern using an [[air filter]] which acts passively on air inhaled by the wearer. Two common examples of this type of respirator are single-use escape hoods and filter masks. The latter are typically simple, light, single-piece, half-face masks and employ the first three mechanical filter mechanisms in the list below to remove particulates from the air stream.  The most common of these is the disposable white N95 variety. It is discarded after single use or some extended period depending on the contaminant. Filter masks also come in replaceable-cartridge, multiple-use models. Typically one or two cartridges attach securely to a mask which has built into it a corresponding number of valves for inhalation and one for exhalation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) and the [[International Safety Equipment Association]] (ISEA) established the American National Standard for Air-Purifying Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices to define both test criteria and approval methods for fire/smoke escape hoods. ANSI/ISEA Standard 110 provides design guidance to manufacturers of Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices (RPED) in the form of performance requirements and testing procedures. The standard covers certification, ISO registration for the manufacturer, associated test methods, labeling, conditioning requirements, independent process and quality control audits, and follow-up inspection programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://safetyequipment.org/c/std110-2009.cfm |title=International Safety Equipment Association |publisher=Safetyequipment.org |accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> ANSI/ISEA 110 was prepared by members of the ISEA RPED group, in consultation with testing laboratories and was reviewed by a consensus panel representing users, health and safety professionals and government representatives.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission uses ANSI/ISEA 110 as the benchmark in their testing of fire escape masks.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n====Mechanical filter====\nMechanical filter respirators retain particulate matter such as dust created during [[woodwork]]ing or metal processing, when contaminated air is passed through the filter material. Wool is still used today as a filter, along with plastic, glass, cellulose, and combinations of two or more of these materials. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[File:Atemluftfilter Einwegmaske.jpg|thumb|Filtering half mask with exhalation valve (class: FFP3)]]\n\nMechanical filters remove contaminants from air in the following ways:\n\n# by ''interception'' when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it;\n# by ''impaction'', when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity\n# by an enhancing mechanism called ''diffusion'', where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100&nbsp;nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter; this effect is similar to [[Brownian motion]] and increases the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the two mechanisms above; it becomes dominant at lower air flow velocities\n# by using certain resins, waxes, and plastics as coatings on the filter material to attract particles with an [[electrostatic charge]] that holds them on the filter surface;\n# by using gravity and allowing particles to settle into the filter material (this effect is typically negligible); and\n# by using the particles themselves, after the filter has been used, to act as a filter medium for other particles.\n\t\nConsidering only particulates carried on an air stream and a fiber mesh filter, diffusion predominates below the 0.1 \u03bcm diameter particle size.

A typical [[organic compound|organic]] vapor respirator cartridge is a metal or plastic case containing from 25 to 40&nbsp;grams of sorption media such as [[activated charcoal]] or certain [[resin]]s.  The service life of the cartridge varies based, among other variables, on the carbon weight and molecular weight of the vapor and the cartridge media, the concentration of vapor in the atmosphere, the relative humidity of the atmosphere, and the breathing rate of the respirator wearer.

There are different units for different environments. The units consist of a powered [[fan (mechanical)|fan]] which forces incoming air through one or more [[filter (air)|filter]]s to the user for breathing. The fan and filters may be carried by the user or they may be remotely mounted and the user breathes the air through tubing.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe filter type must be matched to the contaminants that need to be removed. Some PAPR's are designed to remove fine particulate matter, while others are suitable for working with [[volatile organic compound]]s as those in [[spray paint]]s. These must have their filter elements replaced more often than a particulate filter.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)===\n{{Main|Self-contained breathing apparatus}}\n\nA self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) typically has three main components: a high-pressure air cylinder (e.g., 2200 psi to 4500 psi), a pressure gauge and regulator, and an inhalation connection (mouthpiece, mouth mask or full face mask), connected together and mounted to a carrying frame or a harness with adjustable shoulder straps and belt so it can be worn on the back. There are two kinds of SCBA: open circuit and closed circuit. Most modern SCBAs are open-circuit. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOpen-circuit industrial breathing sets are filled with filtered, compressed air. The compressed air passes through a regulator, is inhaled and exhaled out of the circuit, quickly depleting the supply of air. Air cylinders are made of aluminum, steel, or of a composite construction like fiberglass-wrapped aluminum. The \"positive pressure\" type is common, which supplies a steady stream of air to stop fumes or smoke from leaking into the mask. Other SCBA's are of the \"demand\" type, which only supply air when the regulator senses the user inhaling. All fire departments and those working in toxic environments use the positive pressure SCBA for safety reasons.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe closed-circuit type SCBA filters, supplements, and recirculates exhaled gas like a [[rebreather]]. It is used when a longer-duration supply of breathing gas is needed, such as in mine rescue and in long tunnels, and going through passages too narrow for a large open-circuit air cylinder.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n== Industries using respirators==\nA wide range of industries use respirators including healthcare & pharmaceuticals, defense & public safety services (defense, firefighting & law enforcement), oil and gas industries, manufacturing (automotive, chemical, metal fabrication, food and beverage, wood working, paper and pulp), mining, construction, agriculture and forestry, cement production, power generation, shipbuilding and the textile industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/osh/os/osnr0014.txt|title=Respirator use and practices|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Correct usage ==\n[[File:Protection Factors of filtering facepiece, measured in real time during work.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Respirators testing in the workplaces|Workplace protection factor (PF)]] of filtering facepiece, measured in real time with two optical dust meters.

It was the first time Germany used [[chemical weapon]]s on a large scale releasing 168 tons of [[chlorine gas]] over a four-mile (6&nbsp;km) front killing around 6,000 troops within ten minutes through [[asphyxiation]]. The gas being denser than air flowed downwards forcing troops to climb out of their [[trenches]]. Reserve Canadian troops, who were away from the attack, used [[urine]]-soaked cloths as primitive respirators. A Canadian soldier realized that the [[ammonia]] in urine would react with the chlorine, neutralizing it, and that the water would dissolve the chlorine, allowing soldiers to breathe through the gas.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== 21st century ===\nChina normally makes 10 million masks<!-- or [[dust mask]] or [[surgical mask]]--> per day, about half of the world production.

Its legacy is largely intertwined with that of its founder, [[Herb Abrams]].\n\nA Season 2 episode of ''[[Dark Side of the Ring]]'' focused on the promotion will air in May 2020.<ref>https://www.tvinsider.com/927543/dark-side-of-the-ring-season-2-premiere-chris-benoit/</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Herb Abrams]] founded the UWF in 1990 to try and and challenge [[Vince McMahon]]'s [[World Wrestling Federation]] on a national level. Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''. The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Paul Orndorff]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Ivan Koloff]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.184)</ref> The top homegrown talent included \"Wild Thing\" Steve Ray and \"Cutie Pie\" [[Louie Spicolli]]. [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Albano]] were hired as commentators.\n\nThe promotion held a taping in [[New York City]] at the [[New York Penta]] in January 1991 that was plagued with legal issues. The World Wrestling Federation sent cease and desist orders after [[The Honky Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]] and [[Rick Rude]] appeared on-camera.<ref name=02041991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/feb-4-1991-observer-newsletter-pivotal-week-life-dave-meltzer-89881|title=February 4, 1991 Observer Newsletter: Pivotal week in the life of Dave Meltzer|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=February 4, 1991|accessdate=September 7, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Both had recently walked out of the WWF but were still under contract to the company. Honky Tonk Man would later explain that the check he received from Abrams for this taping bounced, and he filed a formal complaint with the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] to get reimbursed.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r6kIfzFSSM</ref>\n\nAbrams hired Howard Brody, the owner of [[Ladies Major League Wrestling]], to help him expand UWF into the Florida market in mid-1991. Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]]. The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992, a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|starring =\n|country = United States\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]]\n| first_aired = {{Start date|1990}}\n| last_aired = {{End date|1993}}\n| num_episodes = 69 (SportsChannel America)<br>24 (ESPN2)\n| opentheme = \n| website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a deal with national cable network [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990 and ran until 1993. The program also featured matches from the [[Ladies Major League Wrestling|Wild Women of Wrestling]] promotion.\n\nIn 1991, Herb Abrams was owed money by Steve Ray and wrongly suspected that Ray was sleeping with his wife. On May 10, 1991 during a television taping at the [[New York Penta]], Abrams paid [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]] an extra $100 for the night to break Ray's nose during their match. Ray would years later claim this was a Worked Shoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nIn 1995, existing episodes were repackaged to a half-hour format and aired on [[ESPN2]].

Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.184)</ref> The top homegrown talent included \"Wild Thing\" Steve Ray and \"Cutie Pie\" [[Louie Spicolli]]. [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Albano]] were hired as commentators.\n\nThe promotion held a taping in [[New York City]] at the [[New York Penta]] in January 1991 that was plagued with legal issues. The World Wrestling Federation sent cease and desist orders after [[The Honky Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]] and [[Rick Rude]] appeared on-camera.<ref name=02041991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/feb-4-1991-observer-newsletter-pivotal-week-life-dave-meltzer-89881|title=February 4, 1991 Observer Newsletter: Pivotal week in the life of Dave Meltzer|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=February 4, 1991|accessdate=September 7, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Both had recently walked out of the WWF but were still under contract to the company. Honky Tonk Man would later explain that the check he received from Abrams for this taping bounced, and he filed a formal complaint with the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] to get reimbursed.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r6kIfzFSSM</ref>\n\nAbrams hired Howard Brody, the owner of [[Ladies Major League Wrestling]], to help him expand UWF into the Florida market in mid-1991. Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]]. The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992, a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|starring =\n|country = United States\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]]\n| first_aired = {{Start date|1990}}\n| last_aired = {{End date|1993}}\n| num_episodes = 69 (SportsChannel America)<br>24 (ESPN2)\n| opentheme = \n| website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a deal with national cable network [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990 and ran until 1993. The program also featured matches from the [[Ladies Major League Wrestling|Wild Women of Wrestling]] promotion.\n\nIn 1991, Herb Abrams was owed money by Steve Ray and wrongly suspected that Ray was sleeping with his wife. On May 10, 1991 during a television taping at the [[New York Penta]], Abrams paid [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]] an extra $100 for the night to break Ray's nose during their match. Ray would years later claim this was a Worked Shoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nIn 1995, existing episodes were repackaged to a half-hour format and aired on [[ESPN2]].
