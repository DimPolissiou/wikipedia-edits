By 1546 it had become Ardry and by 1587 it was known as Ardrie. In 1630 it finally appeared in the Register as Airdrie. Given the topography of the area, the most likely interpretation is that the name derives from the Gaelic ''An \u00c0rd Ruigh'' meaning a level height or high pasture land. Another possibility is that it is from the Gaelic ''An \u00c0rd \u00c0irighe'' meaning a [[sheiling]], a summer pasture/shepherd's hut. A third possibility is the Gaelic ''Ard Reidh'' meaning a high plain.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Drummond|first1=Peter, John|title=An analysis of toponyms and toponymic  patterns in eight parishes of the upper Kelvin basin|date=2014|publisher=Glasgow University|location=Glasgow|page=322|url=http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5270/1/2014DrummondPhD.pdf#page=323|accessdate=3 July 2017}}</ref> A further, non-Gaelic alternative is the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]], i.e. [[Cumbric]] or North [[Welsh language|Welsh]], ''ard tref'' (becoming ardre by process of assimilation), meaning a high steading or farmstead, which would date back to the times of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], before the expansion of Gaelic or English speech into the region.

Five years later a daughter house was founded at [[Newbattle Abbey]] in Lothian. In 1160 Malcolm granted to the monks of Newbattle lands in central Scotland which became known as the \"Munklands\" (Register of the Great Seal 1323).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=James, Sir|title=Airdrie, a historical sketch|date=1921|publisher=Baird & Hamilton|location=Airdrie|page=3|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074854087;view=1up;seq=15|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nMalcolm's Charter constitutes the oldest documentary record of place-names in the Monklands. The area of land granted by the Charter is clearly defined by direct reference to geographical and topographical features thus: ''Dunpeldre by its right boundaries, namely with Metheraugh and Mayeuth and Clarnephin as far as Dunduffes in the east.'' The name ''Dunpeldre'' is found in the modern name Drumpellier; ''Metheraugh'' is now Medrox; ''Mayeuth'' is now Myvot; ''Clarnephin'' refers to the [[North Calder Water]] in the east of the parish (from old Brittonic name ''claur n afon'' meaning plain of the river); and, finally, ''Dunduffes'' has become directly translated into the modern [[Black Hill transmitting station|Black Hill]] which, as the Charter states, lies at the eastern extremity of the parish. The one thing this Charter does not make any reference to is anything resembling Airdrie yet this is where Airdrie is located.\n[[File:Blaeu - Atlas of Scotland 1654 - GLOTTIANA PR\u00c6FECTVRA INFERIOR - Lower Clydesdale.png|thumb|right|[[Joan Blaeu|Blaeu]]'s map<ref>{{cite web|last1=Blaeu|first1=Joan|url=http://maps.nls.uk/geo/find/#zoom=15&lat=55.8640&lon=-3.9798&layers=17&b=1&point=55.8635,-3.9820|title=Glottiana Praefectura Inferior|website=National Library of Scotland|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref> based on [[Timothy Pont|Pont's]] original<ref>{{cite web|title=Glasgow and the county of Lanark - Pont 34|url=http://maps.nls.uk/rec/297|website=Maps of Scotland|publisher=Timothy Pont (16th century)|accessdate=31 December 2017}}</ref> \"Glasgow and the county of Lanark\" map c.1596 depicting Ardry (Airdrie), Burnsyd (Burnfoot), Carnhil (Cairnhill), Gartly (Gartlea), and Ruchsols (Rochsoles) amongst others.]]\nAirdrie owes its existence to its location on the 'Hogs Back' \u2013 a ridge of land running from east to west.<ref>{{cite web|title=Airdrie|url=http://www.monklands.co.uk/airdrie/|website=Monklands Memories|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> One very important aspect of the town's history was the [[Cistercian]] monks of [[Newbattle Abbey]], which is why the area is called the  Monklands. The monks were farmers and some of their place names survive, e.g., Ryefield and Whifflet (the wheat flats). Much of the land they used is known today as 'The Four Isles' (a housing estate named after four Scottish islands): [[Isle of Mull|Mull]], [[Islay]], [[Iona]] and [[Luing]] in the Petersburn area of modern Airdrie.  The [[monk]]s of Newbattle had numerous establishments throughout the area including a [[farm]] grange at Drumpellier, Coatbridge, a court house at [[Kipps]], a [[chapel]] in the area of Chapelhall and a number of corn [[Mill (grinding)|mills]]. The Monks were also expert in the construction of roads. In the 12th century, they established the original Glasgow to [[Edinburgh]] road via Airdrie and [[Bathgate]], to link up with their lands in Newbattle in [[East Lothian]].\n[[File:The Robert Hamilton Memorial - geograph.org.uk - 1315490.jpg|thumb|right|The Robert Hamilton Memorial]]\nIn those days travelling was often dangerous. Horses were still uncommon and could only be afforded by the rich. Low-lying ground was usually extremely difficult to navigate because of the numerous [[bog]]s, forests and [[Burn (topography)|burns]] \u2013 not to mention the possibility of [[ambush]] by a [[footpad]] or robber. Hence, it became much more practical to travel on the high ground (the 'High Way') where one could avoid the mud and the robbers. These roads (or rather tracks) became known as the King's Highway.\n\nDefinitive evidence of the existence of Airdrie as a tenantry was only made clear in 1503. The old monks' road was via Cliftonhill (an area now in neighbouring Coatbridge), Airdrie House (now the site of [[Monklands Hospital]]), Aitchison Street, High Street, Hallcraig Street, Flowerhill Street and Colliertree Road.  It was along this road that the first houses in Airdrie were built.  Development was slow and it was only around 1650 that evidence of the number of [[population|inhabitants]] was known at around 500 for the Airdrie area. A large contingent of Airdrieonians fought at the [[Battle of Bothwell Brig]] during the Covenanter Rebellion of 1679; their banner can still be viewed at the local library.\n\n[[File:Arms of Airdrie.jpg|thumb|right|Arms of Airdrie - The town's motto is the Latin word Vigilantibus (Being Watchful).

This helped develop Airdrie from a 'farm town' into a thriving 'market town'.<ref>{{cite web|title=1986 AIRDRIE AN OPEN AIR MARKET|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-276000-663000/page/8|website=Domesday Reloaded|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 January 2018|ref=D-block GB-276000-663000}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Airdrie really came to prominence through its [[weaving]] industry. Airdrie Weavers Society was founded in 1781 and [[flax]] was being grown in sixteen farms in and around the [[burgh]]. In the last decade of the eighteenth century, [[coal mining]] was in progress and around thirty [[Coal mining|colliers]] were employed. Weaving continued to flourish making up a substantial part of the population of over 2,500 around the turn of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=James, Sir|title=Airdrie, a historical sketch|date=1921|publisher=Baird & Hamilton|location=Airdrie|pages=73\u201385|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074854087;view=1up;seq=95;size=150|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nGiven its large number of weavers, its geographic location, and a large number of unemployed soldiers following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Airdrie became a major centre of support for the [[Radical War]] of 1820. The rapid pace of population growth continued and by 1821 there were 4,862 inhabitants.  At this time the number of houses being built increased dramatically and in 1821, by a private [[Act of Parliament]], Airdrie became a free and independent [[Burgh of Barony]]. Due to the fact it was 'independent', it had all the powers of a [[Royal burgh|Royal Burgh]].\n\n[[Voting]] in the early part of the nineteenth century was rather hit or miss as not only locals but residents outside the burgh were allowed to vote. In 1821 the first election of a town council took place and by August it had appointed an assessor, [[Procurator Fiscal|procurator fiscal]], master of police and a [[town crier]]. Anyone who had paid their 3 [[guineas]] was allowed to vote; there is even a record of a John Mackay voting despite being under 10 years old.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=James, Sir|title=Airdrie, a historical sketch|date=1921|publisher=Baird & Hamilton|location=Airdrie|page=63|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074854087;view=1up;seq=79;size=150|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1824 it was decided to build the Town House, which was originally designed by Alexander Baird and is now a local landmark known as the 'town clock'. In 1832 the Town House was used as a hospital due to the [[cholera]] outbreak of this year.\n\nBy 1850, the population had grown to 12,418.\n\n===1850 to 1920===\nThe enormous growth in population was not due to high birthrate, but instead due to an influx of residents from the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and predominantly Ireland. This followed the [[Highland Potato Famine|Highland potato famine]] of the mid-1840s and also reflected the change from cottage industry to [[heavy industry]] in the area. Most of the Irish immigrant population were involved with [[mining]] and labouring.\nThis led to an increase in ironwork [[Foundry|foundries]] around the area. Because of this explosion in industry, [[Rail transport|railway]] links were established starting in 1826.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=James, Sir|title=Airdrie, a historical sketch|date=1921|publisher=Baird & Hamilton|location=Airdrie|page=72|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074854087;view=1up;seq=94;size=150|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> By 1862, the Airdrie and Bathgate Junction Railway provided a direct link to Edinburgh with Airdrie South Station providing the starting point for trains to Glasgow.<ref>{{cite web|title=O.S.

Until the mid-1800s, various wells were put in place feeding from surrounding streams in the area. These served to provide many houses with private wells. By 1846 Airdrie and Coatbridge Water Company was founded to construct (along with Forth and Clyde Canal Company) the reservoir at Roughrigg.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=James, Sir|title=Airdrie, a historical sketch|date=1921|publisher=Baird & Hamilton|location=Airdrie|pages=110\u2013112|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074854087;view=1up;seq=132;size=150|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nJournalism in Airdrie began with \"The Airdrie Literary Album\" in 1828. Several local newspapers began appearing around this time notably the [[Airdrie & Coatbridge Advertiser]] in 1855, which is still the most popular local paper today.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=James, Sir|title=Airdrie, a historical sketch|date=1921|publisher=Baird & Hamilton|location=Airdrie|pages=125\u2013129|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074854087;view=1up;seq=155;size=150|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> The prison was legalised in 1859 and had 51 cells.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Groome|first1=Francis Hindes|title=Ordnance gazetteer of Scotland : a survey of Scottish topography, statistical, biographical, and historical|date=1882|publisher=T.C.

Following the codification of association football rules a local team called Excelsior was formed in 1878 which would later be renamed [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]]. Horse race meetings were also held in the town (1851\u20131870) but this land became the golf course for the newly formed Airdrie Golf Club in 1877.\n\n[[Education]] posed a major problem with severe overcrowding in the few schools available, therefore three new school boards were established. In the early 1830s there were about 800 pupils while the town had about 7000 residents.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Begg|first1=James|title=The new statistical account of Scotland.|date=1845|publisher=William Blackwood and Sons|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=244\u2013245|edition=Vol 6|url=https://archive.org/stream/b21365805_0006#page/n261/mode/2up/search/airdrie|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref> Fees were routinely charged within the schools with the belief they should be self-supporting until a parliamentary act of 1889 relieved some of the infant classes in schools of this burden. [[Airdrie Academy]] was built in 1849 and by 1919 all school boards were dissolved and Lanarkshire Education Authority took over responsibility for education throughout [[Lanarkshire]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=James, Sir|title=Airdrie, a historical sketch|date=1921|publisher=Baird & Hamilton|location=Airdrie|pages=112\u2013116|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074854087;view=1up;seq=134;size=150|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Airdrie Public Observatory]], one of only four public observatories in the UK (Second Oldest and Smallest)- all in Scotland, was founded in the first library building in 1896, and is still operated in the present building by the Airdrie Astronomical Association a Scottish [[space exploration|astronautic]] and [[astronomy]] society and registered charity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=James, Sir|title=Airdrie, a historical sketch|date=1921|publisher=Baird & Hamilton|location=Airdrie|pages=120\u2013121|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074854087;view=1up;seq=150;size=150|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the century [[variety show]]s were becoming popular in the area and by 1911 the Pavilion in Graham Street was built which after initially being used as a music hall started showing cinematographic pictures. Unfortunately it was destroyed by fire in 1917 but was rebuilt in 1919 and finally closed in 1970. The New Cinema was opened in 1920 in Broomknoll Street but it too has since closed. The town had no suitable venue for larger functions so in 1912 the Sir John Wilson Town Hall was opened (following a generous offer from Sir John Wilson covering the total cost of \u00a313,500). This still stands and is used for major events in the town.\n\nOn 9 July 1918 nineteen miners died in the Stanrigg Pit Disaster. The pit was situated in boggy land and collapsed after being saturated by heavy rainfall.<ref name=\"SMW\">{{cite web|title=Stanrigg 9th July 1918|url=http://www.scottishmining.co.uk/45.html|website=Scottish Mining Website|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===1920 onwards===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Airdrie War Memorial - geograph.org.uk - 222475.jpg|thumb|right|Airdrie War Memorial]]\nAt the end of the [[World War I|First World War]], Airdrie was hard hit with many casualties from the war. Many inhabitants also chose to emigrate around this time. Consequently, the population only rose by 3% to around 26,000 by 1931. The [[Great Depression|depression]] years had made a great impact on the town and several well-known manufacturers ceased to exist and few replaced them. It was reported that 50% of the registered population were [[Unemployment|unemployed]]. Church groups tried to provide some comfort for the poor folk in the area and set up educational and work experience projects to help and by 1936 the Airdrie Churches Council had attracted national interest through their work culminating in a building in Graham Street being provided for them (the Mutual Service Club). This is now Airdrie Community Centre.\n\nThe current Airdrie Public Library building was eventually constructed on its present site in 1925 after years of moving from one site to another.  [[File:ASTRA - Airdrie Library Building Anderson Street.JPG|thumb| The first Airdrie Public Library building, a [[Carnegie library]] opened 1894.]]\n\nConditions in the town did not really improve until well after the [[World War II|Second World War]] but in 1949 the [[Boots Group|Boots]] [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical company]] and Banner Textiles Ltd were attracted to the town (between them employing 1200). With this impetus, new companies began to consider Airdrie as a viable option for business and in 1958 [[Pye Ltd.|Pye]] opened employing over 1000 people. The emergence of industrial estates was also prevalent around this time (Newhouse, Chapelhall, and Brownsburn). The Airdrie Arts Centre opened in 1967 in the former Airdrie Library building, and was a popular venue for concerts and plays, but was closed in 2012 by North Lanarkshire Council.<ref>https://database.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/2795-airdrie-arts-centre</ref>\n\nThe 1970s saw the opening of [[Monklands Hospital]], which replaced an older hospital on the Airdrie House estate that had been closed in 1962 and demolished in 1964.\n\n===Modern Airdrie===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:The Holehills Flats - geograph.org.uk - 1742668.jpg|thumb|right|The Holehills Flats]]\nAirdrie town centre has changed much in the last ten years with a new road scheme and a shift in emphasis with the type of shopping it offers. Graham Street, the main [[pedestrianised]] street, has recently been refurbished and has had the pedestrian precinct area upgraded. New housing developments are being built around this suitably situated [[commuter town]], notably in Chapelhall, Rochsoles and Glenmavis, the former Boots factory site in Rawyards and the former Imperial Tube Works in Cairnhill.\n\nAirdrie also has signage in the Scots Gaelic language around the town centre, (alongside English) this was first introduced for the 1993 [[Royal National M\u00f2d]].

They were formed as a replacement for the original [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]], who folded in May 2002; in the immediate aftermath of the liquidation of Airdrieonians, a local consortium quickly formed to establish a new club named Airdrie United. Its application to join the Scottish Football League, playing in the traditional Airdrieonians colours at the Excelsior Stadium (now also known as New Broomfield after the club's former home from 1892\u20131994), was rejected in favour of Gretna. The owning consortium swiftly devised a Plan B, and bought Clydebank FC from its administrators. Clydebank's sole asset of any value was its place in the third tier of Scottish professional football. The new owners gained permission to move that club to Airdrie and change the name to Airdrie United, which latter club formally inherited the short life history of Clydebank rather than Airdrieonians.  The United part of the name was dropped informally in July 2012, but the club was still officially known as Airdrie United F.C., until a move back to the Airdrieonians name was finally achieved in June 2013.\n\nThe award-winning Gartcairn Football Academy fields a number of teams, including a junior team, [[Gartcairn F.

In 2005, changes to the constituency boundaries saw part of its area transferred to [[Motherwell and Wishaw (UK Parliament constituency)|Motherwell and Wishaw]], offset by the addition of part of [[Hamilton North and Bellshill (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton North and Bellshill]].\n\n[[Pamela Nash]] was MP for Airdrie and Shotts, elected at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] and was the youngest member of the House of Commons at that time. The location has been represented by several prominent Labour MPs in recent years:\n*[[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for North Lanarkshire 1970\u20131983 and Monklands East 1983\u20131994 (Eastern Coatbridge and Airdrie area).

Between 1975 and 1996, Airdrie came under [[Monklands (district)|Monklands District Council]] operating in conjunction with [[Strathclyde|Strathclyde Regional Council]]. Monklands District Council was headquartered in the Coatbridge Municipal Building. Many Airdrieonians felt short-changed by MDC's actions and a significant political scandal known as [[Monklandsgate]] greatly tarnished the Council's reputation. After 1996, it came under the authority of the unitary [[North Lanarkshire|North Lanarkshire Council]]. North Lanarkshire has many councillors; currently, the council is in control of the Labour group and the leader of the council is [[Jim Logue]], councillor for Airdrie Central.<ref>{{cite web|title=Member and Committee Information|url=https://mars.northlanarkshire.gov.uk/egenda/public/main.pl?op=ListCurrentMembers|publisher=North Lanarkshire Council|accessdate=6 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Law==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Airdriesheriffcourt.jpg|thumb|right|Airdrie Sheriff Court|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 17 October 2009|date=March 2012}}]] -->\n\n===Police===\n[[File:Airdrie Police Badge.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Burgh of Airdrie Police helmet badge (Victorian Crown) pre 1902]]\nPolicing in Airdrie is undertaken by [[Police Scotland]].

Whilst the [[Glenflagler]] Distillery is now closed the town still retains a strong involvement in the [[whisky]] industry. Airdrie was also home to a [[Crimpy]] Crisps factory. It is fair to say that, given its location near to Glasgow and other commercial or industrial areas, Airdrie might now be considered something of a commuter town. In fact housing construction in Airdrie has been very prominent in recent years with builders developing a number of [[brownfield]] sites following the closure of various factories such as Boots who closed their factory in 2004.

By 1546 it had become Ardry and by 1587 it was known as Ardrie. In 1630 it finally appeared in the Register as Airdrie. Given the topography of the area, the most likely interpretation is that the name derives from the Gaelic ''An \u00c0rd Ruigh'' meaning a level height or high pasture land. Another possibility is that it is from the Gaelic ''An \u00c0rd \u00c0irighe'' meaning a [[sheiling]], a summer pasture/shepherd's hut. A third possibility is the Gaelic ''Ard Reidh'' meaning a high plain.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Drummond|first1=Peter, John|title=An analysis of toponyms and toponymic  patterns in eight parishes of the upper Kelvin basin|date=2014|publisher=Glasgow University|location=Glasgow|page=322|url=http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5270/1/2014DrummondPhD.pdf#page=323|accessdate=3 July 2017}}</ref> A further, non-Gaelic alternative is the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]], i.e. [[Cumbric]] or North [[Welsh language|Welsh]], ''ard tref'' (becoming ardre by process of assimilation), meaning a high steading or farmstead, which would date back to the times of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], before the expansion of Gaelic or English speech into the region.

Five years later a daughter house was founded at [[Newbattle Abbey]] in Lothian. In 1160 Malcolm granted to the monks of Newbattle lands in central Scotland which became known as the \"Munklands\" (Register of the Great Seal 1323).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=James, Sir|title=Airdrie, a historical sketch|date=1921|publisher=Baird & Hamilton|location=Airdrie|page=3|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074854087;view=1up;seq=15|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nMalcolm's Charter constitutes the oldest documentary record of place-names in the Monklands. The area of land granted by the Charter is clearly defined by direct reference to geographical and topographical features thus: ''Dunpeldre by its right boundaries, namely with Metheraugh and Mayeuth and Clarnephin as far as Dunduffes in the east.'' The name ''Dunpeldre'' is found in the modern name Drumpellier; ''Metheraugh'' is now Medrox; ''Mayeuth'' is now Myvot; ''Clarnephin'' refers to the [[North Calder Water]] in the east of the parish (from old Brittonic name ''claur n afon'' meaning plain of the river); and, finally, ''Dunduffes'' has become directly translated into the modern [[Black Hill transmitting station|Black Hill]] which, as the Charter states, lies at the eastern extremity of the parish. The one thing this Charter does not make any reference to is anything resembling Airdrie yet this is where Airdrie is located.\n[[File:Blaeu - Atlas of Scotland 1654 - GLOTTIANA PR\u00c6FECTVRA INFERIOR - Lower Clydesdale.png|thumb|right|[[Joan Blaeu|Blaeu]]'s map<ref>{{cite web|last1=Blaeu|first1=Joan|url=http://maps.nls.uk/geo/find/#zoom=15&lat=55.8640&lon=-3.9798&layers=17&b=1&point=55.8635,-3.9820|title=Glottiana Praefectura Inferior|website=National Library of Scotland|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref> based on [[Timothy Pont|Pont's]] original<ref>{{cite web|title=Glasgow and the county of Lanark - Pont 34|url=http://maps.nls.uk/rec/297|website=Maps of Scotland|publisher=Timothy Pont (16th century)|accessdate=31 December 2017}}</ref> \"Glasgow and the county of Lanark\" map c.1596 depicting Ardry (Airdrie), Burnsyd (Burnfoot), Carnhil (Cairnhill), Gartly (Gartlea), and Ruchsols (Rochsoles) amongst others.]]\nAirdrie owes its existence to its location on the 'Hogs Back' \u2013 a ridge of land running from east to west.<ref>{{cite web|title=Airdrie|url=http://www.monklands.co.uk/airdrie/|website=Monklands Memories|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> One very important aspect of the town's history was the [[Cistercian]] monks of [[Newbattle Abbey]], which is why the area is called the  Monklands. The monks were farmers and some of their place names survive, e.g., Ryefield and Whifflet (the wheat flats). Much of the land they used is known today as 'The Four Isles' (a housing estate named after four Scottish islands): [[Isle of Mull|Mull]], [[Islay]], [[Iona]] and [[Luing]] in the Petersburn area of modern Airdrie.  The [[monk]]s of Newbattle had numerous establishments throughout the area including a [[farm]] grange at Drumpellier, Coatbridge, a court house at [[Kipps]], a [[chapel]] in the area of Chapelhall and a number of corn [[Mill (grinding)|mills]]. The Monks were also expert in the construction of roads. In the 12th century, they established the original Glasgow to [[Edinburgh]] road via Airdrie and [[Bathgate]], to link up with their lands in Newbattle in [[East Lothian]].\n[[File:The Robert Hamilton Memorial - geograph.org.uk - 1315490.jpg|thumb|right|The Robert Hamilton Memorial]]\nIn those days travelling was often dangerous. Horses were still uncommon and could only be afforded by the rich. Low-lying ground was usually extremely difficult to navigate because of the numerous [[bog]]s, forests and [[Burn (topography)|burns]] \u2013 not to mention the possibility of [[ambush]] by a [[footpad]] or robber. Hence, it became much more practical to travel on the high ground (the 'High Way') where one could avoid the mud and the robbers. These roads (or rather tracks) became known as the King's Highway.\n\nDefinitive evidence of the existence of Airdrie as a tenantry was only made clear in 1503. The old monks' road was via Cliftonhill (an area now in neighbouring Coatbridge), Airdrie House (now the site of [[Monklands Hospital]]), Aitchison Street, High Street, Hallcraig Street, Flowerhill Street and Colliertree Road.  It was along this road that the first houses in Airdrie were built.  Development was slow and it was only around 1650 that evidence of the number of [[population|inhabitants]] was known at around 500 for the Airdrie area. A large contingent of Airdrieonians fought at the [[Battle of Bothwell Brig]] during the Covenanter Rebellion of 1679; their banner can still be viewed at the local library.\n\n[[File:Arms of Airdrie.jpg|thumb|right|Arms of Airdrie - The town's motto is the Latin word Vigilantibus (Being Watchful).

This helped develop Airdrie from a 'farm town' into a thriving 'market town'.<ref>{{cite web|title=1986 AIRDRIE AN OPEN AIR MARKET|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-276000-663000/page/8|website=Domesday Reloaded|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 January 2018|ref=D-block GB-276000-663000}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Airdrie really came to prominence through its [[weaving]] industry. Airdrie Weavers Society was founded in 1781 and [[flax]] was being grown in sixteen farms in and around the [[burgh]]. In the last decade of the eighteenth century, [[coal mining]] was in progress and around thirty [[Coal mining|colliers]] were employed. Weaving continued to flourish making up a substantial part of the population of over 2,500 around the turn of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=James, Sir|title=Airdrie, a historical sketch|date=1921|publisher=Baird & Hamilton|location=Airdrie|pages=73\u201385|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074854087;view=1up;seq=95;size=150|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nGiven its large number of weavers, its geographic location, and a large number of unemployed soldiers following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Airdrie became a major centre of support for the [[Radical War]] of 1820. The rapid pace of population growth continued and by 1821 there were 4,862 inhabitants.  At this time the number of houses being built increased dramatically and in 1821, by a private [[Act of Parliament]], Airdrie became a free and independent [[Burgh of Barony]]. Due to the fact it was 'independent', it had all the powers of a [[Royal burgh|Royal Burgh]].\n\n[[Voting]] in the early part of the nineteenth century was rather hit or miss as not only locals but residents outside the burgh were allowed to vote. In 1821 the first election of a town council took place and by August it had appointed an assessor, [[Procurator Fiscal|procurator fiscal]], master of police and a [[town crier]]. Anyone who had paid their 3 [[guineas]] was allowed to vote; there is even a record of a John Mackay voting despite being under 10 years old.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=James, Sir|title=Airdrie, a historical sketch|date=1921|publisher=Baird & Hamilton|location=Airdrie|page=63|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074854087;view=1up;seq=79;size=150|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1824 it was decided to build the Town House, which was originally designed by Alexander Baird and is now a local landmark known as the 'town clock'. In 1832 the Town House was used as a hospital due to the [[cholera]] outbreak of this year.\n\nBy 1850, the population had grown to 12,418.\n\n===1850 to 1920===\nThe enormous growth in population was not due to high birthrate, but instead due to an influx of residents from the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and predominantly Ireland. This followed the [[Highland Potato Famine|Highland potato famine]] of the mid-1840s and also reflected the change from cottage industry to [[heavy industry]] in the area. Most of the Irish immigrant population were involved with [[mining]] and labouring.\nThis led to an increase in ironwork [[Foundry|foundries]] around the area. Because of this explosion in industry, [[Rail transport|railway]] links were established starting in 1826.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=James, Sir|title=Airdrie, a historical sketch|date=1921|publisher=Baird & Hamilton|location=Airdrie|page=72|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074854087;view=1up;seq=94;size=150|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> By 1862, the Airdrie and Bathgate Junction Railway provided a direct link to Edinburgh with Airdrie South Station providing the starting point for trains to Glasgow.<ref>{{cite web|title=O.S.

Until the mid-1800s, various wells were put in place feeding from surrounding streams in the area. These served to provide many houses with private wells. By 1846 Airdrie and Coatbridge Water Company was founded to construct (along with Forth and Clyde Canal Company) the reservoir at Roughrigg.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=James, Sir|title=Airdrie, a historical sketch|date=1921|publisher=Baird & Hamilton|location=Airdrie|pages=110\u2013112|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015074854087;view=1up;seq=132;size=150|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nJournalism in Airdrie began with \"The Airdrie Literary Album\" in 1828.

Following the codification of association football rules a local team called Excelsior was formed in 1878 which would later be renamed [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]]. Horse race meetings were also held in the town (1851\u20131870) but this land became the golf course for the newly formed Airdrie Golf Club in 1877.\n\n[[Education]] posed a major problem with severe overcrowding in the few schools available, therefore three new school boards were established. In the early 1830s there were about 800 pupils while the town had about 7000 residents.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Begg|first1=James|title=The new statistical account of Scotland.|date=1845|publisher=William Blackwood and Sons|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=244\u2013245|edition=Vol 6|url=https://archive.org/stream/b21365805_0006#page/n261/mode/2up/search/airdrie|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref> Fees were routinely charged within the schools with the belief they should be self-supporting until a parliamentary act of 1889 relieved some of the infant classes in schools of this burden.

Unfortunately it was destroyed by fire in 1917 but was rebuilt in 1919 and finally closed in 1970. The New Cinema was opened in 1920 in Broomknoll Street but it too has since closed. The town had no suitable venue for larger functions so in 1912 the Sir John Wilson Town Hall was opened (following a generous offer from Sir John Wilson covering the total cost of \u00a313,500). This still stands and is used for major events in the town.\n\nOn 9 July 1918 nineteen miners died in the Stanrigg Pit Disaster.

Many inhabitants also chose to emigrate around this time. Consequently, the population only rose by 3% to around 26,000 by 1931. The [[Great Depression|depression]] years had made a great impact on the town and several well-known manufacturers ceased to exist and few replaced them. It was reported that 50% of the registered population were [[Unemployment|unemployed]]. Church groups tried to provide some comfort for the poor folk in the area and set up educational and work experience projects to help and by 1936 the Airdrie Churches Council had attracted national interest through their work culminating in a building in Graham Street being provided for them (the Mutual Service Club). This is now Airdrie Community Centre.\n\nThe current Airdrie Public Library building was eventually constructed on its present site in 1925 after years of moving from one site to another.  [[File:ASTRA - Airdrie Library Building Anderson Street.JPG|thumb| The first Airdrie Public Library building, a [[Carnegie library]] opened 1894.]]\n\nConditions in the town did not really improve until well after the [[World War II|Second World War]] but in 1949 the [[Boots Group|Boots]] [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical company]] and Banner Textiles Ltd were attracted to the town (between them employing 1200). With this impetus, new companies began to consider Airdrie as a viable option for business and in 1958 [[Pye Ltd.|Pye]] opened employing over 1000 people. The emergence of industrial estates was also prevalent around this time (Newhouse, Chapelhall, and Brownsburn). The Airdrie Arts Centre opened in 1967 in the former Airdrie Library building and remained a popular venue for concerts and plays till it was closed in 2012 by North Lanarkshire Council but has recently been revenaved and modernised by the Council and has now been opened up again.\n\nThe 1970s saw the opening of [[Monklands Hospital]], which replaced an older hospital on the Airdrie House estate that had been closed in 1962 and demolished in 1964.\n\n===Modern Airdrie===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:The Holehills Flats - geograph.org.uk - 1742668.jpg|thumb|right|The Holehills Flats]]\nAirdrie town centre has changed much in the last ten years with a new road scheme and a shift in emphasis with the type of shopping it offers. Graham Street, the main [[pedestrianised]] street, has recently been refurbished and has had the pedestrian precinct area upgraded. New housing developments are being built around this suitably situated [[commuter town]], notably in Chapelhall, Rochsoles and Glenmavis, the former Boots factory site in Rawyards and the former Imperial Tube Works in Cairnhill.\n\nAirdrie also has signage in the Scots Gaelic language around the town centre, (alongside English) this was first introduced for the 1993 [[Royal National M\u00f2d]].

They were formed as a replacement for the original [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]], who folded in May 2002; in the immediate aftermath of the liquidation of Airdrieonians, a local consortium quickly formed to establish a new club named Airdrie United. Its application to join the Scottish Football League, playing in the traditional Airdrieonians colours at the Excelsior Stadium (now also known as New Broomfield after the club's former home from 1892\u20131994), was rejected in favour of Gretna. The owning consortium swiftly devised a Plan B, and bought Clydebank FC from its administrators. Clydebank's sole asset of any value was its place in the third tier of Scottish professional football. The new owners gained permission to move that club to Airdrie and change the name to Airdrie United, which latter club formally inherited the short life history of Clydebank rather than Airdrieonians.  The United part of the name was dropped informally in July 2012, but the club was still officially known as Airdrie United F.C., until a move back to the Airdrieonians name was finally achieved in June 2013.\n\nThe award-winning Gartcairn Football Academy fields a number of teams, including a junior team, [[Gartcairn F.

It would be four decades before the United States would make another appearance at the World Cup.\n\n==1950s\u20131970s==\nDespite the United States' relative success in early international tournaments, soccer remained a niche sport in the U.S. for many years. In the three decades after the 1950 World Cup, the only victories for the United States came against [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]], [[Bermuda national football team|Bermuda]], [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]], [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]], and [[China national football team|China]].\n\n==1980s==\nAfter the enthusiasm caused by the creation and rise of the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|North American Soccer League]] in the 1960s and 1970s, it seemed as though the U.S. men's national team would soon become a powerful force in world soccer. These hopes were not realized, however. The United States played only two international matches from 1981\u20131983.\n\nTo provide a more stable national team program and renew interest in the NASL, U.S. Soccer entered the national team into the league for the 1983 season as [[Team America (NASL)|Team America]]. This team lacked the continuity and regularity of training that conventional clubs enjoy, and many players were unwilling to play for the team instead of their own clubs. Embarrassingly, Team America finished the season at the bottom of the league.  U.S Soccer cancelled this experiment, and the national team was withdrawn from the NASL.\n\nU.S. Soccer targeted the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles, California and the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] as means of rebuilding the national team and their fan base. The [[International Olympic Committee]] declared that teams from outside Europe and South America could field full senior teams, including professionals (until then, the [[amateur]]-only rule had heavily favored [[Eastern Bloc|socialist countries]] from [[Eastern Europe]] whose players were professionals in all but name). The U.S. had a very strong showing at the tournament, beating Costa Rica, tying Egypt, losing only to favorite Italy and [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics|finishing 1\u20131\u20131]] but didn't make the second round, losing to Egypt on a tiebreaker (both had three points).\n\nThe United States bid to host the 1986 World Cup, after [[Colombia]] withdrew from hosting due to economic concerns. However, Mexico beat the U.S. and Canada to host the tournament, despite concerns that the tournament would have to be moved again because of a major earthquake that hit Mexico shortly before the tournament.\n\nBy the end of 1984, the NASL had folded and there was no senior outdoor soccer league operating in the United States.<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00C1EFA355C0C718EDDAD0894DD484D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fS%2fSoccer U.S. Soccer Team Hindered]</ref> As a result, many top American players, such as [[John Kerr, Jr. (soccer)|John Kerr]], [[Paul Caligiuri]], [[Eric Eichmann]], and [[Bruce Murray (soccer)|Bruce Murray]], moved overseas, primarily to Europe.\n\nIn the last game of the qualifying tournament for the 1986 World Cup, the U.S. needed only a draw against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], whom the U.S. had beaten 3\u20130 in the [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] the year before, to reach the final qualification group against Honduras and Canada. U.S. Soccer scheduled the game to be played at [[El Camino College]] in [[Torrance, California|Torrance]], California, an area with many Costa Rican expatriates, and marketed the game almost exclusively to the Costa Rican community, even providing Costa Rican folk dances as halftime entertainment.<sup>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/michael_lewis/news/2000/11/10/lewis_history/]</sup> A 35th-minute goal by [[Evaristo Coronado]] won the match for Costa Rica and kept the United States from reaching its first World Cup since 1950.<sup>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090629040213/http://us-soccer.com/secured/articles/viewArticle.jsp_3063.html]</sup>\n\nIn 1988, U.S. Soccer attempted to reimplement its national-team-as-club concept, offering contracts to national team players, to build an international team with something of a club ethos, while loaning them out to their club teams, saving U.S. Soccer the expense of their salaries. This brought many key veterans back to the team, while the success of the NASL a decade earlier had created an influx of talent from burgeoning grass-roots level clubs and youth programs. Thus U.S. Soccer sought to establish a more stable foundation for participation in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] than had existed for previous tournaments.\n\n==1990s: Rebirth for American soccer==\n===1990 World Cup===\nIn 1988, FIFA named the United States hosts of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], but it did so under significant international criticism because of the perceived weakness of the national team and the lack of a professional outdoor league. This criticism diminished somewhat when a 1\u20130 win against Trinidad and Tobago, the U.S.'s first away win in nearly two years, in the last match of the [[1989 CONCACAF Championship]], earned the United States their first World Cup appearance in 40 years.\n\nFor the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] in Italy, two of the team's more experienced players, [[Rick Davis]] and [[Hugo P\u00e9rez (soccer)|Hugo Perez]], were recovering from serious injuries and unavailable for selection, and manager [[Bob Gansler]] selected many inexperienced players and recent college graduates. The U.S. went on to lose all three of their games to [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]].\n\n===CONCACAF success===\nIn March 1991, the United States won the North America Cup, tying Mexico 2\u20132 and beating Canada 2\u20130. This was followed in May by a 1\u20130 victory over [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in the [[World Series of Soccer]]. The national team then went undefeated in the [[1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1991 Gold Cup]], beating Mexico 2\u20130 in the semifinals and [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] 4\u20133 on [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s after a 0\u20130 draw in the final. In 1992, the U.S. continued its run of success, taking the [[1992 U.S. Cup|U.S. Cup]] with victories over [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] and Portugal, followed by a draw with Italy.\n\n===Hosting the 1994 World Cup===\nHaving qualified automatically as host, the U.S. opened their tournament schedule with a 1\u20131 draw against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] in the suburbs of Detroit, the first World Cup game played indoors.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In its second game, the U.S. faced [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], then ranked fourth in the world, at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], and the United States won 2\u20131.<ref>Lewis, Michael.

Sports Illustrated and Soccer Digest have called the game the \"Miracle on Grass.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0906/soccer.biggest.us.wins.in.history/content.10.html | work=CNN | title=1950 World Cup vs. England | accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref> A 5\u20132 defeat by [[Chile national football team|Chile]] in the third group match saw the U.S. eliminated from the tournament. It would be four decades before the United States would make another appearance at the World Cup.\n\n==1950s\u20131970s==\nDespite the United States' relative success in early international tournaments, soccer remained a niche sport in the U.S. for many years. In the three decades after the 1950 World Cup, the only victories for the United States came against [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]], [[Bermuda national football team|Bermuda]], [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]], [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]], and [[China national football team|China]].\n\n==1980s==\nAfter the enthusiasm caused by the creation and rise of the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|North American Soccer League]] in the 1960s and 1970s, it seemed as though the U.S. men's national team would soon become a powerful force in world soccer. These hopes were not realized, however. The United States played only two international matches from 1981\u20131983.\n\nTo provide a more stable national team program and renew interest in the NASL, U.S. Soccer entered the national team into the league for the 1983 season as [[Team America (NASL)|Team America]]. This team lacked the continuity and regularity of training that conventional clubs enjoy, and many players were unwilling to play for the team instead of their own clubs. Embarrassingly, Team America finished the season at the bottom of the league.  U.S Soccer cancelled this experiment, and the national team was withdrawn from the NASL.\n\nU.S. Soccer targeted the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles, California and the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] as means of rebuilding the national team and their fan base. The [[International Olympic Committee]] declared that teams from outside Europe and South America could field full senior teams, including professionals (until then, the [[amateur]]-only rule had heavily favored [[Eastern Bloc|socialist countries]] from [[Eastern Europe]] whose players were professionals in all but name). The U.S. had a very strong showing at the tournament, beating Costa Rica, tying Egypt, losing only to favorite Italy and [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics|finishing 1\u20131\u20131]] but didn't make the second round, losing to Egypt on a tiebreaker (both had three points).\n\nThe United States bid to host the 1986 World Cup, after [[Colombia]] withdrew from hosting due to economic concerns. However, Mexico beat the U.S. and Canada to host the tournament, despite concerns that the tournament would have to be moved again because of a major earthquake that hit Mexico shortly before the tournament.\n\nBy the end of 1984, the NASL had folded and there was no senior outdoor soccer league operating in the United States.<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00C1EFA355C0C718EDDAD0894DD484D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fS%2fSoccer U.S. Soccer Team Hindered]</ref> As a result, many top American players, such as [[John Kerr, Jr. (soccer)|John Kerr]], [[Paul Caligiuri]], [[Eric Eichmann]], and [[Bruce Murray (soccer)|Bruce Murray]], moved overseas, primarily to Europe.\n\nIn the last game of the qualifying tournament for the 1986 World Cup, the U.S. needed only a draw against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], whom the U.S. had beaten 3\u20130 in the [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] the year before, to reach the final qualification group against Honduras and Canada. U.S. Soccer scheduled the game to be played at [[El Camino College]] in [[Torrance, California|Torrance]], California, an area with many Costa Rican expatriates, and marketed the game almost exclusively to the Costa Rican community, even providing Costa Rican folk dances as halftime entertainment.<sup>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/michael_lewis/news/2000/11/10/lewis_history/]</sup> A 35th-minute goal by [[Evaristo Coronado]] won the match for Costa Rica and kept the United States from reaching its first World Cup since 1950.<sup>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090629040213/http://us-soccer.com/secured/articles/viewArticle.jsp_3063.html]</sup>\n\nIn 1988, U.S. Soccer attempted to reimplement its national-team-as-club concept, offering contracts to national team players, to build an international team with something of a club ethos, while loaning them out to their club teams, saving U.S. Soccer the expense of their salaries. This brought many key veterans back to the team, while the success of the NASL a decade earlier had created an influx of talent from burgeoning grass-roots level clubs and youth programs. Thus U.S. Soccer sought to establish a more stable foundation for participation in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] than had existed for previous tournaments.\n\n==1990s: Rebirth for American soccer==\n===1990 World Cup===\nIn 1988, FIFA named the United States hosts of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], but it did so under significant international criticism because of the perceived weakness of the national team and the lack of a professional outdoor league. This criticism diminished somewhat when a 1\u20130 win against Trinidad and Tobago, the U.S.'s first away win in nearly two years, in the last match of the [[1989 CONCACAF Championship]], earned the United States their first World Cup appearance in 40 years.\n\nFor the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] in Italy, two of the team's more experienced players, [[Rick Davis]] and [[Hugo P\u00e9rez (soccer)|Hugo Perez]], were recovering from serious injuries and unavailable for selection, and manager [[Bob Gansler]] selected many inexperienced players and recent college graduates. The U.S. went on to lose all three of their games to [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]].\n\n===CONCACAF success===\nIn March 1991, the United States won the North America Cup, tying Mexico 2\u20132 and beating Canada 2\u20130. This was followed in May by a 1\u20130 victory over [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in the [[World Series of Soccer]]. The national team then went undefeated in the [[1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1991 Gold Cup]], beating Mexico 2\u20130 in the semifinals and [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] 4\u20133 on [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s after a 0\u20130 draw in the final. In 1992, the U.S. continued its run of success, taking the [[1992 U.S. Cup|U.S. Cup]] with victories over [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] and Portugal, followed by a draw with Italy.\n\n===Hosting the 1994 World Cup===\nHaving qualified automatically as host, the U.S. opened their tournament schedule with a 1\u20131 draw against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] in the suburbs of Detroit, the first World Cup game played indoors.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In its second game, the U.S. faced [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], then ranked fourth in the world, at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], and the United States won 2\u20131.<ref>Lewis, Michael.

The knockout stage was reached through a 3\u20132 win over [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and a 1\u20131 tie with co-host and eventual fourth-place finisher, [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]], rendering a 3-0 loss to [[Poland national football team|Poland]] in the final game irrelevant.\n\nThis set the stage for a Round 2 face-off with familiar continental rivals [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. The U.S. emerged victorious in the first World Cup showdown between the two old adversaries, 2\u20130.

The United States has continuously had a fluctuating [[public debt]] since then, except for about a year during 1835\u20131836. To allow comparisons over the years, public debt is often expressed as a ratio to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Historically, the United States public debt as a share of GDP has increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined.\n\nThe United States public debt as a percentage of GDP reached its highest level during [[Harry Truman]]'s first presidential term, during and after [[World War II]]. Public debt as a percentage of GDP fell rapidly in the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion|post-World War II period]], and reached a low in 1973 under President [[Richard Nixon]]. Debt as a share of GDP has consistently increased since then, except during the terms of presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Bill Clinton]]. Public debt rose during the 1980s, as [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] cut tax rates and increased military spending. It fell during the 1990s, due to decreased military spending, increased taxes and the [[1990s United States boom|1990s boom]]. Public debt rose sharply in the wake of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2007\u201308 financial crisis]] and the resulting significant tax revenue declines and spending increases.\n\n==Early history==\n[[File:P13 3Large.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]]'s ''First Report on the Public Credit'', January 9, 1790]]\n\n===1790s===\nExcept for about a year during 1835\u20131836, the United States has continuously had a fluctuating public debt since its Constitution went into effect on March 4, 1789.

The Southern states, which had lower or no debts, whose citizens would effectively pay a portion of this debt if the federal government assumed it, were disinclined to accept the proposal. Some states, including Virginia, had already paid off almost half of their debts, and felt that their taxpayers should not be assessed again to bail out the less provident, and further argued that the plan was beyond the constitutional power of the new government. [[James Madison]], then a representative from Virginia, led a group of legislators from the South in blocking the provision and prevent the plan from gaining approval. Jefferson supported Madison<ref name=\"Ellis-p48\">{{Harvnb|Ellis|2002|pp=48\u201352}}</ref> The plan was finally adopted as part of the [[Compromise of 1790]], as the [[Funding Act of 1790]].  The compromise meant that the state debts were all picked up by the federal Treasury, and the permanent national capital would be located in the South, along the Virginia-Maryland border in what became the District of Columbia.\n\n===The assumption issue===\nHistorian Max M. Edling has explained how assumption worked.  It was the critical issue; the location of the capital was a bargaining ploy.  Hamilton proposed that the federal Treasury take over and pay off all the debt that states had incurred to pay for the American Revolution. The Treasury would issue bonds that rich people would buy, thereby giving the rich a tangible stake in the success of the national government.  Hamilton proposed to pay off the new bonds with revenue from a new tariff on imports. Jefferson originally approved the scheme, but Madison had turned him around by arguing that federal control of debt would consolidate too much power in the national government. Edling points out that after its passage in 1790, the assumption was accepted. Madison did try to pay speculators below 100%, but they were paid the face value of the state debts they held regardless of how little they paid for them.  When Jefferson became president he continued the system.  The credit of the U.S. was solidly established at home and abroad, and Hamilton was successful in signing up many of the bondholders in his new Federalist Party. Good credit allowed Jefferson's Treasury Secretary [[Albert Gallatin]] to borrow in Europe to finance the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, as well as to borrow to finance the War of 1812.<ref>Max M.

The federal government was able to avoid competing in interest with the States.\n\nThe debts of the federal government on January 1, 1791 amounted to $75,463,476.52, of which about $40 million was [[domestic debt]], $12 million was [[foreign debt]], and $18.3 million were state debts assumed by the federal government, of the $21.5 million that had been authorized.<ref name=Trescott>{{cite journal|last=Trescott|first=Paul|title=Federal-State Financial Relations, 1790\u20131860|jstor=2114655|volume=15|pages=227\u201345}}</ref>\n\n===1790s to 1834===\nTo reduce the debt, from 1796 to 1811 there were 14 budget surpluses and 2 deficits.

of the United States public debt''' started with [[National debt of the United States|federal government debt]] incurred during the [[American Revolutionary War]] by the first U.S treasurer, [[Michael Hillegas]], after its formation in 1789. The United States has continuously had a fluctuating [[public debt]] since then, except for about a year during 1835\u20131836. To allow comparisons over the years, public debt is often expressed as a ratio to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Historically, the United States public debt as a share of GDP has increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined.\n\nThe United States public debt as a percentage of GDP reached its highest level during [[Harry Truman]]'s first presidential term, during and after [[World War II]]. Public debt as a percentage of GDP fell rapidly in the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion|post-World War II period]], and reached a low in 1973 under President [[Richard Nixon]]. Debt as a share of GDP has consistently increased since then, except during the terms of presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Bill Clinton]]. Public debt rose during the 1980s, as [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] cut tax rates and increased military spending. It fell during the 1990s, due to decreased military spending, increased taxes and the [[1990s United States boom|1990s boom]].

The Southern states, which had lower or no debts, whose citizens would effectively pay a portion of this debt if the federal government assumed it, were disinclined to accept the proposal. Some states, including Virginia, had already paid off almost half of their debts, and felt that their taxpayers should not be assessed again to bail out the less provident, and further argued that the plan was beyond the constitutional power of the new government. [[James Madison]], then a representative from Virginia, led a group of legislators from the South in blocking the provision and prevent the plan from gaining approval. Jefferson supported Madison<ref name=\"Ellis-p48\">{{Harvnb|Ellis|2002|pp=48\u201352}}</ref> The plan was finally adopted as part of the [[Compromise of 1790]], as the [[Funding Act of 1790]].  The compromise meant that the state debts were all picked up by the federal Treasury, and the permanent national capital would be located in the South, along the Virginia-Maryland border in what became the District of Columbia.\n\n===The assumption issue===\nHistorian Max M. Edling has explained how assumption worked.  It was the critical issue; the location of the capital was a bargaining ploy.  Hamilton proposed that the federal Treasury take over and pay off all the debt that states had incurred to pay for the American Revolution. The Treasury would issue bonds that rich people would buy, thereby giving the rich a tangible stake in the success of the national government.  Hamilton proposed to pay off the new bonds with revenue from a new tariff on imports. Jefferson originally approved the scheme, but Madison had turned him around by arguing that federal control of debt would consolidate too much power in the national government. Edling points out that after its passage in 1790, the assumption was accepted. Madison did try to pay speculators below 100%, but they were paid the face value of the state debts they held regardless of how little they paid for them.  When Jefferson became president he continued the system.  The credit of the U.S. was solidly established at home and abroad, and Hamilton was successful in signing up many of the bondholders in his new Federalist Party. Good credit allowed Jefferson's Treasury Secretary [[Albert Gallatin]] to borrow in Europe to finance the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, as well as to borrow to finance the War of 1812.<ref>Max M.

After the forces of [[Hanno the Great]] were defeated at [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], and failed to engage the mercenaries afterwards despite favorable conditions, Carthage raised a new army under [[Hamilcar Barca]] in Carthage. Hamilcar managed to leave Carthage despite the rebel blockade of the city and cross the Bagradas River (the ancient name of the [[Medjerda River|Medjerda]]). Rebel armies from besieging Utica and the camp guarded the bridge on the Bagradas River. Hamilcar Barca, by brilliant maneuvering, defeated the combined rebel army. This was the first major Carthaginian victory of the war. A description of the battle forms one of the grandiose set-piece scenes of [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s novel, Salammbo.\n\n== Background ==\n{{further|Mercenary War}}\nThe [[First Punic War]] ended with the Roman victory in the [[Battle of Aegates Islands|Battle of the Aegates Islands]] in March 241 BC and Carthage authorizing [[Hamilcar Barca]] to start peace negotiations with Rome. The eventual settlement between [[Roman republic|Rome]] and Carthage included evacuation of Sicily by Carthage and payment of 3,200 silver talents to Rome as war reparations: 1,000 (21 tons of silver) immediately and 2,200 (56 ton of silver) in ten yearly installments. After paying Rome the indemnity which was part of the treaty,<ref>Polybius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#62 1:62.8-63.3].</ref> it could not easily pay the army of some 20,000 [[mercenaries]] it had employed to fight against Rome.<ref name=\"PAY\">Polybius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#66 66.5], and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#68 1:68.12]</ref>\n\nDelays in dealing with the mercenaries eventually led to the gathering of the entire army and their families in Sicca Veneria (modern [[El Kef]]), where they demanded payment from the Carthaginian negotiator [[Hanno the Great]].<ref>Polybius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#66 1:66.6-66.12].</ref> The exact amount owned the mercenaries can only be guessed, but given the back pay, ration money and any other rewards promised, it probably was a substantial amount,<ref name=\"Hoyos Dexter pp27-31\">Hoyos Dexter, The Truceless War, p. 27\u201331</ref> which the mercenaries inflated after they reached Sicca. When Hanno refused their demands, as Carthage actually hoped to reduce the payment amount, and mercenaries were unsympathetic about the financial difficulties of Carthage, the negotiations broke down and the mercenaries seized [[Tunis]].<ref>Po0lybius 1.66.1-1.6712</ref> Carthage then sent provisions to Tunis and agreed to all the demands of the mercenaries, and sent Gisco to pay off the demanded amount.<ref>Appian, [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_sicily.html#%A74 2.7]; Polybius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#67 1:67.1-68.13].</ref>\n\nGisco began to pay off the mercenaries nationality by nationality,<ref>Polybius 1.68.1, 1.69.3</ref> and events might have ended there, but two mercenary leaders, Spendius and Mathos, fomented revolt among the Libyan troops, for their own personal reasons, and were eventually able to persuade the entire mercenary army to revolt. The mercenaries seized the Carthaginian negotiators and the money. Matho used the funds to pay off the amount due to the mercenaries and fund the war effort.<ref>Polybius 1.69.4, 1.70.6</ref> After settling the mercenary payments, the rebels called upon the Libyan towns and cities under Carthaginian control to join the revolt. Several Libyan cities joined the revolt, providing men and funds (Libyan women donated personal possessions and jewels)<ref>Polybius 1.72.5-6</ref> to gather a force of 70,000.<ref>Polybius 1.70.8-9</ref> These events probably took place in the autumn-winter of 241 BC.\n\n==Opening moves==\nMatho divided the rebel army into several detachments. Matho took two armies to cut off the cities of [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and Hippacritae, while an army took up position along the only bridge over the River Macar linking Carthage and Utica. Spendius cut off Carthage from the mainland<ref>Polybius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#68 1:68.4-68.13].</ref> while rebels made Tunis their main base. The rebels had no siege weapons and decided not to assault the besieged towns, but they would from time to time advance on Carthage to terrorize the city.<ref>Polybius 1.73.7</ref>\n\nWith their navy shattered in the [[First Punic War]] and their mercenaries in revolt, Carthage could do little but man the walls as an immediate response to the revolt. Carthage raised an army from citizens and mercenaries,<ref>Polybius 1.73.1-2</ref> trained their cavalry, and refitted their navy,<ref>Polybius 1.73</ref> which probably took until the spring of 240&nbsp;BC. [[Hanno the Great]] was put in command of the army, which included 110 elephants,<ref>Polybius 1.74.3-4</ref> but the exact number of troops is unknown. Hanno chose to relieve Utica,<ref name=\"Polybius 1.74\">Polybius 1.74</ref> since rebels had cut off Carthage from the mainland; Hanno and his army were probably ferried to Utica by the Punic fleet,<ref>{{cite book| last = Lancel| first = Serge| title = Hannibal| year = 1998| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| isbn = 978-0-631-20631-6| url = https://archive.org/details/hannibal00lanc}}</ref> which was also under siege by the rebel army under Spendius. The exact size of the rebel force is not known. Hanno initially defeated the rebels encamped near Utica and captured the rebel camp, but his negligence and the lax discipline of the Carthaginian army enabled the rebels to regroup, launch a surprise attack, capture the Carthaginian camp, and drive the Carthaginian survivors into Utica.<ref name=\"Polybius 1.74\"/> Hanno\u2019s army later left Utica but failed several times to engage the rebels under favorable conditions. Carthage decided to raise a new army and recalled Hamilcar Barca to command. The rebels continued their blockade of Carthage, Utica, and Hippo Acra.\n\n==Hamilcar Barca given a command==\nWhile Hanno the Great was campaigning against the rebels, Carthage had cobbled together another army raised from citizens, rebel deserters, and newly hired mercenaries, numbering 8,000 foot, 2,000 horse and 70 elephants.<ref>Polybius 1.73.1, 1.75.2</ref> Hamilcar Barca was given command of this force, and he spent some time training his soldiers. Carthage made no fresh move against the rebels. Hanno and his army continued watching the two rebel camps at Hippo Acra. The rebel army under Spendius, numbering 15,000, was blockading Utica. Another 10,000 strong rebel army was encamped near the only bridge across the River Bagradas,<ref>Polybius 1.75.5</ref> the exact location is not known.<ref name=\"Lancel, Serge, Hannibal, pp17\">Lancel, Serge, Hannibal, p. 17.</ref> Note that the course of the Bagradas river changed numerous times since the 3<sup>rd</sup> century BC<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Delile |first1=Hugo |last2=Abichou |first2=Abdelhakim |last3=Gadhoum |first3=Ahmed |last4=Goiran |first4=Jean-Philippe |last5=Pleuger |first5=Elisa |last6=Monchambert |first6=Jean-Yves |last7=Wilson |first7=Andrew |last8=Fentress |first8=Elizabeth |last9=Quinn |first9=Josephine |last10=Ben Jerbania |first10=Imed |last11=Ghozzi |first11=Faouzi |title=The Geoarchaeology of Utica, Tunisia: The Paleogeography of the Mejerda Delta and Hypotheses Concerning the Location of the Ancient Harbor |journal=Geoarchaeology |date=July 2015 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=291\u2013306 |doi=https://doi.org/10.1002/gea.21514}}</ref>, therefore the battle likely took place south of the current mouth of the river. \n\nOnce his army was properly trained, Hamilcar did not attack the rebels blockading Carthage head on. Instead, he sought to gain the freedom to maneuver and fight the rebels on his own terms. The rebel base at Tunis and rebel dispositions, which probably barricaded the passes on the hills between Djebdl Ammar and Djebel Nahli, cut Carthage off from the mainland.<ref name=\"Lancel, Serge, Hannibal, pp17\"/> Hamilcar had observed that, when the wind blew from a certain direction, a sandbar was uncovered on the river mouth, which made the Bagradas River fordable.\n\nHamilcar marched his army out of Carthage at night along the north shore of the isthmus towards the mouth of the Bagradas River. His movement was not detected by the rebels and at the first opportunity he crossed the Bagradas River along the sandbar. Hamilcar\u2019s army was free to manoeuvre in the African countryside.\n\n===Composition of Forces===\nCarthaginian citizens normally wore armor, greaves, and Greek style helmets, carried a round shield, long spear, and sword, and fought in phalanx formation. Carthaginian citizens and the Libyo-Phoenicians provided disciplined, well-trained cavalry equipped with thrusting spears and round shields. Any mercenaries in Hanno the Great\u2019s army may have resembled the rebels they were facing. Carthage also used elephants, probably African Forest and Indian elephants as shock troops. The elephants were ridden by specially trained riders, some of whom may have come from ancient India or Syria.\n\nThe rebel army had Libyans, Iberians, Gauls, Greeks, and probably Thracians and Scythians present, along with Campanians and Roman deserters.<ref name=\"Polybius 1.67.7\">Polybius 1.67.7</ref> The Libyan heavy infantry fought in close formation, armed with long spears and round shields, wearing helmets and linen cuirasses. The light Libyan infantry carried javelins and a small shield, same as Iberian light infantry. The Iberian infantry wore purple bordered white tunics and leather headgear. The heavy Iberian infantry fought in a dense phalanx, armed with heavy throwing spears, long body shields, and short thrusting swords.<ref>{{cite book| author = Paul Bentley Kern| title = Ancient Siege Warfare| year = 1999| publisher = Indiana University Press| isbn = 978-0-253-33546-3| page = 32 }}</ref> Campanian, Sardinian, Sicel, and Gallic infantry fought in their native gear,<ref>{{cite book| last = Markoe| first = Glenn| title = Phoenicians| year = 2000| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-22614-2| pages = 84\u201386 }}</ref> but often were equipped by Carthage. Sicels, Sardinians, and other Sicilians were equipped like Greek [[Hoplites]], as were the Sicilian Greek mercenaries. Balearic Slingers fought in their native gear.\n\nNumidians provided superb light cavalry armed with bundles of javelins and riding without bridle or saddle, and light infantry armed with javelins. Iberians and Gauls also provided cavalry, which relied on the all out charge.\n\n==The battle==\nHamilcar\u2019s army completed the river crossing unmolested and undetected by the rebels, and then moved towards the rebel camp near the bridge. Spendius led 15,000 troops from Utica to confront Hamilcar, while 10,000 rebels from the camp near the bridge also advanced towards Hamilcar\u2019s position.<ref name=\"Polybius 1.67.7\"/> Caught in a pincer movement, Hamilcar started to march north. The two rebels forces joined up and began to march north on a parallel course. The army of Spendius outnumbered Hamilcar\u2019s army two to one, so he could afford to form his army in two lines, although the rebels had no elephants and nothing is known of their cavalry. Spendius extended his left flank to the north in an attempt to outflank the Carthaginians. His intention was to have his right flank stop the Carthaginian movement north while his main force attacked and pushed the Carthaginain army towards the river.<ref>Polybius 1.76.1-5</ref>\n\n===Hamilcar\u2019s maneuver===\nSpendius' plan was foiled by Himalcar Barca\u2019s brilliant counter-maneuver, which enabled his outnumbered and seemingly outmaneuvered army to emerge victorious in the ensuing battle. Exactly what Hamilcar did is not clearly known and the issue has been much discussed.<ref name=\"Lancel, Serge, Hannibal, pp17\"/><ref>Hoyos Dexter, The Truceless War, p. 115\u2013124.</ref> It is known that Hamilcar pretended to retreat, which caused the rebels to launch a disorderly attack, while Hamilcar got his soldiers in battle formation to crush the rebels.\n\n====About turn====\n[[Image:Macar1.PNG|150px|right|thumb|Battle of Macar 240 BC. A generic representation, giving one possible scenario, not to exact scale and path of troop movement are inexact because of lack of primary source data]]\n\nAccording to one line of thought,<ref>Bagnall, Nigel, The Punic Wars, p. 116\u2013117.</ref> the Carthaginian army's order of march had the [[War Elephant]]s leading the column, with the light troops and cavalry behind the elephants. Heavy infantry formed the rearguard, and the whole army marched in a single file in battle formation.\n\nWhen Hamilcar observed Spendius extending his battle line to outflank the Carthaginian right flank and cut off the Carthaginian army\u2019s line of advance, he ordered his elephants to turn right, away from the rebel army. The cavalry and light infantry did the same after the elephants, while the heavy infantry continued to move forward. The rebels mistook this for a withdrawal and rushed forward to engage. This wild charge disordered their battle line, some rebel units moving ahead of others.<ref>Polybius 1.76.5</ref>\n\nThe elephants then again turned right, followed by the Carthaginian light infantry and cavalry, so they were now moving south. Parallel to the heavy infantry in the opposite direction The Carthaginian infantry, moving northwards, stopped, turned left and formed a battle line, facing the onrushing rebels. The elephants, light infantry and cavalry are now positioned behind the Carthaginian heavy infantry battle line.\n\nThe Carthaginian elephants, light infantry and cavalry again turned right, divided into two divisions, and took their position on both flanks of the Carthaginian heavy infantry. The rebel formations no longer outflanked the Carthaginian army, and a solid battle line now confronted a disorderly rebel army.\n\n====Triple column====\n[[Image:Macar2.PNG|150px|right|thumb|Battle of Macar 240 BC. A generic representation, giving one possible scenario, not to exact scale and path of troop movement are inexact because of lack of primary source data]]\n\nAccording to another line of thought,<ref>Dodge, T.A, Hannibal, pp 135</ref> Hamilcar\u2019s army marched in three separate columns, The war elephants were placed nearest the rebel army. The cavalry and light infantry was in the middle, while the heavy infantry was posted furthest from the rebel army.\n\nAs the three Carthaginian columns moved north, Spendius extended his left flank to overlap the Carthaginian formation and outflank and cut off the Carthaginians. Hamilcar\u2019s army halted its march seeing this development. The cavalry and light infantry, and the elephants turned right, then moved through gaps in the heavy infantry formation. The rebels mistook this as a Carthaginian withdrawal and rushed forward to attack.\n\nThe Carthaginian heavy infantry next turns right, close gaps and form a battle line to face the rebels. The elephants, cavalry and light infantry split into two divisions, and move into position on the flanks of the Carthaginian heavy infantry. The rebel formations no longer outflanked the Carthaginian army, and a solid battle line confronted a disorderly rebel formation.\n\n===Punic Victory===\nAs the numerically superior but outgeneraled rebels closed and confronted the solid Carthaginian battle line, pandemonium ensued. Instead of hitting the Carthaginians with an orderly formation of infantry en masse, some rebel units engaged the Carthaginians before other units could arrive in support, while others stopped to regroup. As a result, some rebel units were thrown back by the Carthaginians, or as some of the units stopped their charge, the units following them ploughed straight into their back. Battle cohesion was lost and, before the rebels could reorder and regroup, Carthaginian cavalry and infantry charged the entangled rebel units. Scores of rebels were killed, and as the Carthaginian infantry followed up the cavalry and elephant charge, the rebel army broke and scattered, having lost 6,000 of their number. Carthaginian pursuit secured 2,000 prisoners.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe surviving rebels fled either to Utica or to their camp beside the bridge. Hamilcar, after mopping up the battle field, advanced on the rebel camp, forcing the rebels to flee to Tunes, where they were reunited with their commander Spendius. Hamilcar then moved towards Utica, forcing the rebels to flee to Hippo Acra. The rebel blockade of Utica was broken.

After the forces of [[Hanno the Great]] were defeated at [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], and failed to engage the mercenaries afterwards despite favorable conditions, Carthage raised a new army under [[Hamilcar Barca]] in Carthage. Hamilcar managed to leave Carthage despite the rebel blockade of the city and cross the Bagradas River (the ancient name of the [[Medjerda River|Medjerda]]). Rebel armies from besieging Utica and the camp guarded the bridge on the Bagradas River. Hamilcar Barca, by brilliant maneuvering, defeated the combined rebel army. This was the first major Carthaginian victory of the war. A description of the battle forms one of the grandiose set-piece scenes of [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s novel, Salammbo.\n\n== Background ==\n{{further|Mercenary War}}\nThe [[First Punic War]] ended with the Roman victory in the [[Battle of Aegates Islands|Battle of the Aegates Islands]] in March 241 BC and Carthage authorizing [[Hamilcar Barca]] to start peace negotiations with Rome. The eventual settlement between [[Roman republic|Rome]] and Carthage included evacuation of Sicily by Carthage and payment of 3,200 silver talents to Rome as war reparations: 1,000 (21 tons of silver) immediately and 2,200 (56 ton of silver) in ten yearly installments. After paying Rome the indemnity which was part of the treaty,<ref>Polybius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#62 1:62.8-63.3].</ref> it could not easily pay the army of some 20,000 [[mercenaries]] it had employed to fight against Rome.<ref name=\"PAY\">Polybius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#66 66.5], and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#68 1:68.12]</ref>\n\nDelays in dealing with the mercenaries eventually led to the gathering of the entire army and their families in Sicca Veneria (modern [[El Kef]]), where they demanded payment from the Carthaginian negotiator [[Hanno the Great]].<ref>Polybius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#66 1:66.6-66.12].</ref> The exact amount owned the mercenaries can only be guessed, but given the back pay, ration money and any other rewards promised, it probably was a substantial amount,<ref name=\"Hoyos Dexter pp27-31\">Hoyos Dexter, The Truceless War, p. 27\u201331</ref> which the mercenaries inflated after they reached Sicca. When Hanno refused their demands, as Carthage actually hoped to reduce the payment amount, and mercenaries were unsympathetic about the financial difficulties of Carthage, the negotiations broke down and the mercenaries seized [[Tunis]].<ref>Po0lybius 1.66.1-1.6712</ref> Carthage then sent provisions to Tunis and agreed to all the demands of the mercenaries, and sent Gisco to pay off the demanded amount.<ref>Appian, [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_sicily.html#%A74 2.7]; Polybius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#67 1:67.1-68.13].</ref>\n\nGisco began to pay off the mercenaries nationality by nationality,<ref>Polybius 1.68.1, 1.69.3</ref> and events might have ended there, but two mercenary leaders, Spendius and Mathos, fomented revolt among the Libyan troops, for their own personal reasons, and were eventually able to persuade the entire mercenary army to revolt. The mercenaries seized the Carthaginian negotiators and the money. Matho used the funds to pay off the amount due to the mercenaries and fund the war effort.<ref>Polybius 1.69.4, 1.70.6</ref> After settling the mercenary payments, the rebels called upon the Libyan towns and cities under Carthaginian control to join the revolt. Several Libyan cities joined the revolt, providing men and funds (Libyan women donated personal possessions and jewels)<ref>Polybius 1.72.5-6</ref> to gather a force of 70,000.<ref>Polybius 1.70.8-9</ref> These events probably took place in the autumn-winter of 241 BC.\n\n==Opening moves==\nMatho divided the rebel army into several detachments. Matho took two armies to cut off the cities of [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and Hippacritae, while an army took up position along the only bridge over the River Macar linking Carthage and Utica. Spendius cut off Carthage from the mainland<ref>Polybius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#68 1:68.4-68.13].</ref> while rebels made Tunis their main base. The rebels had no siege weapons and decided not to assault the besieged towns, but they would from time to time advance on Carthage to terrorize the city.<ref>Polybius 1.73.7</ref>\n\nWith their navy shattered in the [[First Punic War]] and their mercenaries in revolt, Carthage could do little but man the walls as an immediate response to the revolt. Carthage raised an army from citizens and mercenaries,<ref>Polybius 1.73.1-2</ref> trained their cavalry, and refitted their navy,<ref>Polybius 1.73</ref> which probably took until the spring of 240&nbsp;BC. [[Hanno the Great]] was put in command of the army, which included 110 elephants,<ref>Polybius 1.74.3-4</ref> but the exact number of troops is unknown. Hanno chose to relieve Utica,<ref name=\"Polybius 1.74\">Polybius 1.74</ref> since rebels had cut off Carthage from the mainland; Hanno and his army were probably ferried to Utica by the Punic fleet,<ref>{{cite book| last = Lancel| first = Serge| title = Hannibal| year = 1998| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell| isbn = 978-0-631-20631-6| url = https://archive.org/details/hannibal00lanc}}</ref> which was also under siege by the rebel army under Spendius. The exact size of the rebel force is not known. Hanno initially defeated the rebels encamped near Utica and captured the rebel camp, but his negligence and the lax discipline of the Carthaginian army enabled the rebels to regroup, launch a surprise attack, capture the Carthaginian camp, and drive the Carthaginian survivors into Utica.<ref name=\"Polybius 1.74\"/> Hanno\u2019s army later left Utica but failed several times to engage the rebels under favorable conditions. Carthage decided to raise a new army and recalled Hamilcar Barca to command. The rebels continued their blockade of Carthage, Utica, and Hippo Acra.\n\n==Hamilcar Barca given a command==\nWhile Hanno the Great was campaigning against the rebels, Carthage had cobbled together another army raised from citizens, rebel deserters, and newly hired mercenaries, numbering 8,000 foot, 2,000 horse and 70 elephants.<ref>Polybius 1.73.1, 1.75.2</ref> Hamilcar Barca was given command of this force, and he spent some time training his soldiers. Carthage made no fresh move against the rebels. Hanno and his army continued watching the two rebel camps at Hippo Acra. The rebel army under Spendius, numbering 15,000, was blockading Utica. Another 10,000 strong rebel army was encamped near the only bridge across the River Bagradas,<ref>Polybius 1.75.5</ref> the exact location is not known.<ref name=\"Lancel, Serge, Hannibal, pp17\">Lancel, Serge, Hannibal, p. 17.</ref> Note that the course of the Bagradas river changed numerous times since the 3<sup>rd</sup> century BC,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Delile |first1=Hugo |last2=Abichou |first2=Abdelhakim |last3=Gadhoum |first3=Ahmed |last4=Goiran |first4=Jean-Philippe |last5=Pleuger |first5=Elisa |last6=Monchambert |first6=Jean-Yves |last7=Wilson |first7=Andrew |last8=Fentress |first8=Elizabeth |last9=Quinn |first9=Josephine |last10=Ben Jerbania |first10=Imed |last11=Ghozzi |first11=Faouzi |title=The Geoarchaeology of Utica, Tunisia: The Paleogeography of the Mejerda Delta and Hypotheses Concerning the Location of the Ancient Harbor |journal=Geoarchaeology |date=July 2015 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=291\u2013306 |doi=https://doi.org/10.1002/gea.21514}}</ref>, therefore the battle likely took place south of the current mouth of the river. \n\nOnce his army was properly trained, Hamilcar did not attack the rebels blockading Carthage head on. Instead, he sought to gain the freedom to maneuver and fight the rebels on his own terms. The rebel base at Tunis and rebel dispositions, which probably barricaded the passes on the hills between Djebdl Ammar and Djebel Nahli, cut Carthage off from the mainland.<ref name=\"Lancel, Serge, Hannibal, pp17\"/> Hamilcar had observed that, when the wind blew from a certain direction, a sandbar was uncovered on the river mouth, which made the Bagradas River fordable.\n\nHamilcar marched his army out of Carthage at night along the north shore of the isthmus towards the mouth of the Bagradas River. His movement was not detected by the rebels and at the first opportunity he crossed the Bagradas River along the sandbar. Hamilcar\u2019s army was free to manoeuvre in the African countryside.\n\n===Composition of Forces===\nCarthaginian citizens normally wore armor, greaves, and Greek style helmets, carried a round shield, long spear, and sword, and fought in phalanx formation. Carthaginian citizens and the Libyo-Phoenicians provided disciplined, well-trained cavalry equipped with thrusting spears and round shields. Any mercenaries in Hanno the Great\u2019s army may have resembled the rebels they were facing. Carthage also used elephants, probably African Forest and Indian elephants as shock troops. The elephants were ridden by specially trained riders, some of whom may have come from ancient India or Syria.\n\nThe rebel army had Libyans, Iberians, Gauls, Greeks, and probably Thracians and Scythians present, along with Campanians and Roman deserters.<ref name=\"Polybius 1.67.7\">Polybius 1.67.7</ref> The Libyan heavy infantry fought in close formation, armed with long spears and round shields, wearing helmets and linen cuirasses. The light Libyan infantry carried javelins and a small shield, same as Iberian light infantry. The Iberian infantry wore purple bordered white tunics and leather headgear. The heavy Iberian infantry fought in a dense phalanx, armed with heavy throwing spears, long body shields, and short thrusting swords.<ref>{{cite book| author = Paul Bentley Kern| title = Ancient Siege Warfare| year = 1999| publisher = Indiana University Press| isbn = 978-0-253-33546-3| page = 32 }}</ref> Campanian, Sardinian, Sicel, and Gallic infantry fought in their native gear,<ref>{{cite book| last = Markoe| first = Glenn| title = Phoenicians| year = 2000| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-22614-2| pages = 84\u201386 }}</ref> but often were equipped by Carthage. Sicels, Sardinians, and other Sicilians were equipped like Greek [[Hoplites]], as were the Sicilian Greek mercenaries. Balearic Slingers fought in their native gear.\n\nNumidians provided superb light cavalry armed with bundles of javelins and riding without bridle or saddle, and light infantry armed with javelins. Iberians and Gauls also provided cavalry, which relied on the all out charge.\n\n==The battle==\nHamilcar\u2019s army completed the river crossing unmolested and undetected by the rebels, and then moved towards the rebel camp near the bridge. Spendius led 15,000 troops from Utica to confront Hamilcar, while 10,000 rebels from the camp near the bridge also advanced towards Hamilcar\u2019s position.<ref name=\"Polybius 1.67.7\"/> Caught in a pincer movement, Hamilcar started to march north. The two rebels forces joined up and began to march north on a parallel course. The army of Spendius outnumbered Hamilcar\u2019s army two to one, so he could afford to form his army in two lines, although the rebels had no elephants and nothing is known of their cavalry. Spendius extended his left flank to the north in an attempt to outflank the Carthaginians. His intention was to have his right flank stop the Carthaginian movement north while his main force attacked and pushed the Carthaginain army towards the river.<ref>Polybius 1.76.1-5</ref>\n\n===Hamilcar\u2019s maneuver===\nSpendius' plan was foiled by Himalcar Barca\u2019s brilliant counter-maneuver, which enabled his outnumbered and seemingly outmaneuvered army to emerge victorious in the ensuing battle. Exactly what Hamilcar did is not clearly known and the issue has been much discussed.<ref name=\"Lancel, Serge, Hannibal, pp17\"/><ref>Hoyos Dexter, The Truceless War, p. 115\u2013124.</ref> It is known that Hamilcar pretended to retreat, which caused the rebels to launch a disorderly attack, while Hamilcar got his soldiers in battle formation to crush the rebels.\n\n====About turn====\n[[Image:Macar1.PNG|150px|right|thumb|Battle of Macar 240 BC. A generic representation, giving one possible scenario, not to exact scale and path of troop movement are inexact because of lack of primary source data]]\n\nAccording to one line of thought,<ref>Bagnall, Nigel, The Punic Wars, p. 116\u2013117.</ref> the Carthaginian army's order of march had the [[War Elephant]]s leading the column, with the light troops and cavalry behind the elephants. Heavy infantry formed the rearguard, and the whole army marched in a single file in battle formation.\n\nWhen Hamilcar observed Spendius extending his battle line to outflank the Carthaginian right flank and cut off the Carthaginian army\u2019s line of advance, he ordered his elephants to turn right, away from the rebel army. The cavalry and light infantry did the same after the elephants, while the heavy infantry continued to move forward. The rebels mistook this for a withdrawal and rushed forward to engage. This wild charge disordered their battle line, some rebel units moving ahead of others.<ref>Polybius 1.76.5</ref>\n\nThe elephants then again turned right, followed by the Carthaginian light infantry and cavalry, so they were now moving south. Parallel to the heavy infantry in the opposite direction The Carthaginian infantry, moving northwards, stopped, turned left and formed a battle line, facing the onrushing rebels. The elephants, light infantry and cavalry are now positioned behind the Carthaginian heavy infantry battle line.\n\nThe Carthaginian elephants, light infantry and cavalry again turned right, divided into two divisions, and took their position on both flanks of the Carthaginian heavy infantry. The rebel formations no longer outflanked the Carthaginian army, and a solid battle line now confronted a disorderly rebel army.\n\n====Triple column====\n[[Image:Macar2.PNG|150px|right|thumb|Battle of Macar 240 BC. A generic representation, giving one possible scenario, not to exact scale and path of troop movement are inexact because of lack of primary source data]]\n\nAccording to another line of thought,<ref>Dodge, T.A, Hannibal, pp 135</ref> Hamilcar\u2019s army marched in three separate columns, The war elephants were placed nearest the rebel army. The cavalry and light infantry was in the middle, while the heavy infantry was posted furthest from the rebel army.\n\nAs the three Carthaginian columns moved north, Spendius extended his left flank to overlap the Carthaginian formation and outflank and cut off the Carthaginians. Hamilcar\u2019s army halted its march seeing this development. The cavalry and light infantry, and the elephants turned right, then moved through gaps in the heavy infantry formation. The rebels mistook this as a Carthaginian withdrawal and rushed forward to attack.\n\nThe Carthaginian heavy infantry next turns right, close gaps and form a battle line to face the rebels. The elephants, cavalry and light infantry split into two divisions, and move into position on the flanks of the Carthaginian heavy infantry. The rebel formations no longer outflanked the Carthaginian army, and a solid battle line confronted a disorderly rebel formation.\n\n===Punic Victory===\nAs the numerically superior but outgeneraled rebels closed and confronted the solid Carthaginian battle line, pandemonium ensued. Instead of hitting the Carthaginians with an orderly formation of infantry en masse, some rebel units engaged the Carthaginians before other units could arrive in support, while others stopped to regroup. As a result, some rebel units were thrown back by the Carthaginians, or as some of the units stopped their charge, the units following them ploughed straight into their back. Battle cohesion was lost and, before the rebels could reorder and regroup, Carthaginian cavalry and infantry charged the entangled rebel units. Scores of rebels were killed, and as the Carthaginian infantry followed up the cavalry and elephant charge, the rebel army broke and scattered, having lost 6,000 of their number. Carthaginian pursuit secured 2,000 prisoners.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe surviving rebels fled either to Utica or to their camp beside the bridge. Hamilcar, after mopping up the battle field, advanced on the rebel camp, forcing the rebels to flee to Tunes, where they were reunited with their commander Spendius. Hamilcar then moved towards Utica, forcing the rebels to flee to Hippo Acra. The rebel blockade of Utica was broken. Hamilcar had the choice to join up with Hanno and try to lift the rebel blockade of Hippo Acra as well. Instead he began to mop up the lands beside the Bagradas River, by force or diplomacy asserting Carthaginian authority over the rebel Libyan towns, thus cutting off the rebels from sources funds, recruits and provisions and ensuring Carthage can tap the same resources.\n\n== References ==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n=== Bibliography ===\nThe main source for information about ''The Mercenary War'' comes from [[Polybius]], a Greek historian writing many years after the events portrayed here, because no Punic [[primary source]]s survived into modern times.

At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the Chief Officer of the steamer ''Clan McIntyre''. By about 06:00 ''Waratah'' was abeam of ''Clan McIntyre'' and approximately 2\u20133 miles away, at which point both vessels exchanged signals.

Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under.

This passenger, physicist Professor [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]]. When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite.

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Drifting===\nAs the ''Waratah'' was considered unsinkable, a theory which was initially popular was that she had broken down and was adrift on the sea currents. Optimism that she was still afloat were bolstered by the experience of the steamer [[SS Waikato|SS ''Waikato'']] which had in 1899 broken down off the Cape, and had drifted eastwards for 100 days covering 3,000 miles, before being discovered and towed to Australia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article190075528 |title=The Waikato's Experience. |newspaper=[[Gympie Times And Mary River Mining Gazette]] |volume=XLI |issue=5412 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=21 August 1909 |accessdate=15 July 2019 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> As ''Waratah'' lacked any radio equipment, she would have been unable to communicate with any ships beyond visual range. However despite extensive searches, no trace of ''Waratah'' was found.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=51\u201353|ps=}}\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n===Paranormal===\nSeveral supernatural theories were also put forward to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah''. Claude Sawyer reported to the London inquiry that he had during the voyage seen on three occasions in dreams the vision of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" He decided that this vision was a warning, and was one of the reasons why he decided not to continue the voyage on the ''Waratah'' and to get off the ship at Durban.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

In July 1909, on only her second voyage, the ship, en route from [[Durban]] to [[Cape Town]], disappeared with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Design and construction==\nIn September 1907 W. Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. ''Waratah'' had a cellular [[double bottom]] built along her entire length, and the hull was divided into eight [[watertight compartment]]s, which it was claimed rendered her \"practically immune from any danger of sinking.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article69965453 |title=S.S.

In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day.

The fire was largely brought under control by noon on the same day but continued reigniting until 10 December. The fire was apparently caused by the heat emitted by several reducing and steam valves located on the starboard side of the engine room. While the roof of the engine room was insulated, the starboard side was evidently not. The repairs were performed at Sydney to the chief engineer's satisfaction.\n\nDuring her maiden trip the steamer was scrutinized by the Captain and the crew, as one of the criteria used in acceptance trials was the ship's handling and stability. Captain Ilbery was not completely satisfied and, considering he was previously in charge of ''Geelong'', presumably reported to the owners that the ship did not have the same stability as his old vessel.

Sawyer, an engineer and experienced sea traveller, left the ship and sent the following [[Telegram|cable]] to his wife in London: \"Thought Waratah top-heavy, landed Durban\".\n\nThe ''Waratah'' left Durban at approximately 20:15 on 26 July with 211 passengers and crew. At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the Chief Officer of the steamer ''Clan McIntyre''. By about 06:00 ''Waratah'' was abeam of ''Clan McIntyre'' and approximately 2\u20133 miles away, at which point both vessels exchanged signals. ''Waratah'' then sped up, going approximately 13 knots, crossed ''Clan McIntyre''{{'}}s bow, and disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a gale sprang up in the area, so bad that ''Clan McIntyre'' could make only 32 miles in the 24 hours to noon on 29 July, with wind gusting to {{convert|50|kn|mph km/h}} combined against the tide and ocean swell to build waves up to {{convert|30|ft|m}}, forcing the vessel to pitch heavily. That evening the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"\n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nThe same evening, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw a large steamer coming up astern of her, working hard in the heavy seas and making a great deal of smoke, enough to make her captain wonder if the steamer was on fire.

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously.

It quickly came to focus on the supposed instability of the ''Waratah''.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=129|ps=}} Evidence was greatly hampered by the lack of any survivors from the ship's final voyage (other than the small number, including Claude Sawyer, who had disembarked in [[Durban]]). Most evidence came from passengers and crew from ''Waratah's'' maiden voyage, her builders and those who had handled her in port.\n\nThe expert witnesses all agreed that the ''Waratah'' was designed and built properly and sailed in good condition.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=130|ps=}} She had passed numerous inspections, including those by her builders, her owners, the Board of Trade and two by [[Lloyd's of London]], who gave her the classification \"+100 A1\"&nbsp;\u2013 their top rating,{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=118, 130|ps=}} granted only to ships Lloyds had inspected and assessed throughout the design, construction, fitting out and [[sea trial]]s, on top of the two valuations and inspections Lloyds had made of the completed ''Waratah''.\n\nHowever many witnesses who had travelled on the ship testified that the ''Waratah'' felt unstable, frequently [[Angle of list|listed]] to one side even in calm conditions, [[Ship motions|rolled]] excessively and was very slow to come upright after leaning into a swell, and had a tendency for her [[bow (ship)|bow]] to dip into oncoming waves rather than ride over them.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\"/><ref name=\"NLAInqreport\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5235069 |title=THE WARATAH.

This passenger, physicist Professor [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]]. When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite. Both former passengers and crew members (ranking from stokers to a deck officer) said the ''Waratah'' was perfectly stable, with a comfortable, easy roll.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=133|ps=}} Many said they felt she was especially stable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5153599 |title=THE S.S.

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Drifting===\nAs the ''Waratah'' was considered unsinkable, a theory which was initially popular was that she had broken down and was adrift on the sea currents. Optimism that she was still afloat were bolstered by the experience of the steamer [[SS Waikato|SS ''Waikato'']] which had in 1899 broken down off the Cape, and had drifted eastwards for 100 days covering 3,000 miles, before being discovered and towed to Australia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article190075528 |title=The Waikato's Experience. |newspaper=[[Gympie Times And Mary River Mining Gazette]] |volume=XLI |issue=5412 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=21 August 1909 |accessdate=15 July 2019 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> As ''Waratah'' lacked any radio equipment, she would have been unable to communicate with any ships beyond visual range. However despite extensive searches, no trace of ''Waratah'' was found.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=51\u201353|ps=}}\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n===Paranormal===\nSeveral supernatural theories were also put forward to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah''. Claude Sawyer reported to the London inquiry that he had during the voyage seen on three occasions in dreams the vision of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" He decided that this vision was a warning, and was one of the reasons why he decided not to continue the voyage on the ''Waratah'' and to get off the ship at Durban.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.
