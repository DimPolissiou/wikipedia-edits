A year later, her best friend [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] gets her out during a prison break and tries to convince her that he does not love her. Despite Ivy's support, Harley's attempt to break up with Joker fails after he sweet-talks her into staying with him. The [[Riddler]], who also escaped Arkham, provokes Joker into sending Harley to kill him. Riddler captures her and [[Batman]] before giving Joker the choice to save one while the other dies. When Joker ultimately chooses Batman, Harley finally realizes she never meant anything to him. It's also revealed the death trap was devised by Ivy and Riddler to drive that point home and she was never really in any danger.

However, they accidentally crash a Bar Mitzvah for [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]'s nephew, Joshua. When Joker gets wind of Harley's presence and arrives at the party, Harley struggles to dissociate herself from him and prove to the attending villains, [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and [[Two-Face]], how much better she is doing without him. This is exacerbated by her attempt to pull off a heist nearby, only to learn it was a staged heist with actors for Joshua to experience. Meanwhile, Ivy is relentlessly hit on by [[Kite Man]], who inadvertently infects a group of boys with her pheromones; not realizing it will kill them by turning them into plants. They rush to her apartment to retrieve the antidote and return in time to help Harley fight off the other villains. Using her psychology background, Harley convinces them to stop taking abuse from Joker, forcing the clown prince to leave.

However, she struggles to recruit others to her cause due to her gender and her past association with Joker. After talking with the [[Queen of Fables]], Harley decides she needs other downtrodden villains like her. She starts by recruiting disgraced [[Wonder Woman]] villain [[Doctor Psycho]], who was kicked out of the Legion of Doom by [[Lex Luthor]] for calling her and [[Giganta]] the \"[[Cunt|C word]]\" on national television instead of the \"[[Bitch (slang)|B word]].\" They next recruit Gotham City's shapeshifting thespian extraordinaire [[Clayface]] after meeting him in a bar. For their first heist, Harley decides to rob [[Maxie Zeus]]' Olympic Gold Medals as revenge for insults he made against her during her quest. Despite their initial struggles, they ultimately succeed after brutally beating up Zeus before Harley sells the medals to purchase a nuclear warhead and force the city into naming a highway after her.

After a failed attempt to get [[Superman]] to be her nemesis by kidnapping [[Lois Lane]], Harley recruits [[King Shark]] into her crew, captures Robin, threatens him into confessing he lied, then reveals the talk show audience behind a curtain to publicly humiliate him. When King Shark goes berserk after smelling blood, Batman arrives and subdues him before getting into a three-way brawl with the arriving Joker, Harley, and Ivy. Joker ends the fight by kidnapping Robin and forcing Batman to pursue them. Much to Ivy's dismay, she and Harley's crew are evicted from their apartment by their cybernetic landlord [[Sy Borgman]].

While trying to find the \"Emergency Exit\" in her subconscious, Harley discovers her indecision comes from the belief her \"origin story\" was not her decision and that she altered her memory to believe that her becoming a villain was Joker's doing. Choosing the moment she broke up with him as her true \"origin story,\" Harley cures herself somewhat. Meanwhile, Borgman finds Harley and her crew's comatose bodies and believes they committed suicide, so he takes them to an abandoned mall to cremate them.

While Harley, Clayface, and King Shark try to recover the hand, Ivy and Psycho seek revenge on an online personality called the Cowled Critic, who slandered them. King Shark is beaten by police officers and sent to prison while Ivy and Psycho learn the Cowled Critic is the latter's estranged son Herman, and makes amends with him. While in a shoot-out with Gordon, Harley discovers the device is a teleporter when it sends her to the [[Batcave]]. Once Harley realizes she had been selfish and ignoring her teammates, she encourages Batman to help stop Gordon after he starts obsessively defending the hand.

Amidst said chase, Ivy tells Harley her fear is being abandoned by someone she trusted and that she resents her for being with the Joker instead of helping her. Harley attempts to make amends by blowing off the head of her statue to stop Scarecrow, but he succeeds in poisoning the Gotham Reservoir and infecting the city's water supply with Ivy's pheromones; turning most of Gotham's trees into violent monsters.\n| LineColor       = B30205\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n| Title           = Devil's Snare\n| DirectedBy      = Juan Meza-Leon\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Becker\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|14}}\n| ShortSummary    = Scarecrow starts crop-dusting fear toxin around Gotham's perimeters to force thousands of civilians towards the park with the murderous trees. As Batman tracks him down, the [[Justice League]] arrives to stop the trees. They assume Harley's crew is behind the attacks and attempt to send them to the [[Phantom Zone]], but Ivy uses Wonder Woman's lasso to prove them wrong. Suddenly, the Queen of Fables traps the League in her fairy tale book before using a beanstalk to send Harley and her crew to be attacked by a giant [[cyclops]]. With Kite Man's help, they are able to return to the ground safely. Just then, Joker appears with a large tower and destroys the Hall of Doom as he enacts his plans to take over Gotham City and orders the Queen to kill Harley and her team. Ivy uses the contaminated water to grow into a giant to fight the trees while Harley defeats the Queen, beheading her in the process.

However, Clayface inadvertently ruins the plan and gets the crew and Batman captured while Harley is forced into hiding. His takeover largely complete, Joker spends the next week subjugating Gotham and brutally torturing Batman and the crew, only to get bored. Hoping to help, Scarecrow unmasks Batman, but Joker kills him for ruining the \"mystery\". Meanwhile, Harley revisits Ivy's grave, where Frank and Kite Man tell her the crew's going to be publicly executed, so she surrenders herself in exchange for their lives. Once her crew's safe, Harley tries to kill Joker, but he gets the upper hand. Instead of killing her, Joker decides to drop her in acid that will render her \"normal.\" At the last minute, a resurrected Ivy saves Harley and drops Joker in the acid, though not before he destroys his tower and Gotham. Batman saves Harley and Ivy before disappearing in the debris. Reunited, the crew reflect on everything that has happened amidst Gotham's ruins while a \"normal\" Joker emerges from the rubble.\n| LineColor       = B30205\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2 (2020)===\n{{Episode table |background=#000000 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=25 |director=17 |writer=32 |airdate=16 |released=y |titleR=<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dcuniverse.com/videos/harley-quinn/193/season-2 |title=Watch ''Harley '' Season 2 on DC Universe |website=DC Universe |accessdate=April 10, 2020 |url-access=limited}}</ref> |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url= http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/harley-quinn/listings/|title=Shows A-Z - harley quinn on dc|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 14\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = New Gotham\n| DirectedBy      = Vinton Heuck\n| WrittenBy       = Adam Stein\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3}}\n| ShortSummary    = Weeks after Joker's defeat and Batman's disappearance, the President has declared the destroyed Gotham a no man's land while Harley and her crew revel in the resulting anarchy and Robin tries to take up the mantle of Batman.

Harley disapproves of their control, especially after they give her a small amount of territory, and attempts to rebel against them; only to get herself captured. Months later, Ivy and the rest of the crew manage to break her out, giving her the chance to murder the Penguin and see that the rest of the Injustice League have taken over the rest of Gotham. Seeing as how she was the one who defeated the Joker, Harley believes she deserves to rule the city and vows to take out all of her rivals.

Harley and Ivy steal the invitations for themselves and Clayface and successfully enter the party, where they learn that the kidnapped students are being used as human batteries before Riddler captures them. Meanwhile, dissatisfied with doing nothing, Barbara becomes inspired by her father, Commissioner Gordon, to stop Riddler herself.

The [[Riddler]], who also escaped Arkham, provokes Joker into sending Harley to kill him. Riddler captures her and [[Batman]] before giving Joker the choice to save one while the other dies. When Joker ultimately chooses Batman, Harley finally realizes she never meant anything to him. It's also revealed the death trap was devised by Ivy and Riddler to drive that point home and she was never really in any danger.

When Joker gets wind of Harley's presence and arrives at the party, Harley struggles to dissociate herself from him and prove to the attending villains, [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], and [[Two-Face]], how much better she is doing without him. This is exacerbated by her attempt to pull off a heist nearby, only to learn it was a staged heist with actors for Joshua to experience. Meanwhile, Ivy is relentlessly hit on by [[Kite Man]], who inadvertently infects a group of boys with her pheromones; not realizing it will kill them by turning them into plants. They rush to her apartment to retrieve the antidote and return in time to help Harley fight off the other villains.

King Shark is beaten by police officers and sent to prison while Ivy and Psycho learn the Cowled Critic is the latter's estranged son Herman, and makes amends with him.

Harley reconciles with Ivy and promises to help her attack an environmentally unfriendly company called Planetwide Pavers. Unlike Harley however, her crew are treated as lowly henchmen and Bane hires them to help him get revenge on a clerk for always getting his name wrong. Harley attends a dinner date with Joker to try to persuade him to convince Luthor to elevate her crew's status, but she has so much fun with him, she forgets to tell him. While planting a bomb for Bane, King Shark ends up being hospitalized after the former loses patience and detonates it early. When Batman pursues them, Joker kisses Harley before shoving her out of his helicopter to slow the dark knight down. While the crew and Ivy stand vigil over King Shark in the hospital, they see an out-of-context image of Joker and Harley kissing on the news. When Harley arrives, they accuse her of taking advantage of them and cut ties with her.

Her father claims he owes a loan shark money, so Harley beats him and his goons to force them to leave her father alone. Meanwhile, Ivy finds herself trapped in a laboratory, but manages to use a dandelion to tell her sentient plant Frank to get Harley's help. She's later shocked to find that Scarecrow's her captor. Another assassin attacks and kills Harley's grandfather before she defeats her. Her parents suddenly attack her, explaining that someone put a bounty on her and they aim to collect.

Psycho brings the crew into Ivy's head while Borgman protects their bodies. Inside her head, Frank informs them the only way to save Ivy is to destroy the thing she fears the most, which appears in the form of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]. Harley defeats the Reaper, but sees her face under the hood before they wake up. Scarecrow tries to escape on the Harley Quinn Highway, but Borgman transforms into a car so the crew can give chase. Amidst said chase, Ivy tells Harley her fear is being abandoned by someone she trusted and that she resents her for being with the Joker instead of helping her. Harley attempts to make amends by blowing off the head of her statue to stop Scarecrow, but he succeeds in poisoning the Gotham Reservoir and infecting the city's water supply with Ivy's pheromones; turning most of Gotham's trees into violent monsters.\n| LineColor       = B30205\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n| Title           = Devil's Snare\n| DirectedBy      = Juan Meza-Leon\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Becker\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|14}}\n| ShortSummary    = Scarecrow starts crop-dusting fear toxin around Gotham's perimeters to force thousands of civilians towards the park with the murderous trees.

Harley disapproves of their control, especially after they give her a small amount of territory, and attempts to rebel against them; only to get herself captured. Months later, Ivy and the rest of the crew manage to break her out, giving her the chance to murder the Penguin and see that the rest of the Injustice League have taken over the rest of Gotham. Seeing as how she was the one who defeated the Joker, Harley believes she deserves to rule the city and vows to take out all of her rivals.

Harley and Ivy track down Barbara to kill her before she can warn Riddler, but she tells them she wants to stop him after deducing he was responsible for kidnapping students ever since he took over and that she procured invitations for a party at a fraternity house where the disappearances are happening. Harley and Ivy steal the invitations for themselves and Clayface and successfully enter the party, where they learn that the kidnapped students are being used as human batteries before Riddler captures them. Meanwhile, dissatisfied with doing nothing, Barbara becomes inspired by her father, Commissioner Gordon, to stop Riddler herself.

This play was successful and Amrapurkar was noticed by director [[Govind Nihalani]], who was searching for an actor to play the central negative character in his movie ''[[Ardh Satya]]''. The movie went on to be a hit and Amrapurkar's acting was appreciated. His style of dialog delivery was considered unique as compared to the popular Hindi movie villains in those days.

He played the role of a tough, upright cop who reprimands his children for leaving an elderly widow to fend for herself on the streets. The film touched on the problems old people face with the breakdown of the joint family system. It was a subject close to Sadashiv's heart and he did the role for free.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/He-requested-me-to-let-him-wear-a-sari/articleshow/45031596.cms |title='He requested me to let him wear a sari' |work=The Times of India |date=4 November 2014 |accessdate=2018-03-13}}</ref>\n\nAmrapurkar was a philanthropist, social activist, and was engaged in a number of social organizations such as Samajik Krutadnyata Nidhi, Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti, Snehalaya, Lokshahi Prabodhan Vyaspeeth, Ahmednagar Aitihasik Vastu Sangrahalaya, and many others.

This play was successful and Amrapurkar was noticed by director [[Govind Nihalani]], who was searching for an actor to play the central negative character in his movie ''[[Ardh Satya]]''. The movie went on to be a hit and Amrapurkar's acting was appreciated. His style of dialog delivery was considered unique as compared to the popular Hindi movie villains in those days.

He played the role of a tough, upright cop who reprimands his children for leaving an elderly widow to fend for herself on the streets.

During the 1976 tournament he also logged Arizona's first and only tournament wins until Lute Olson's hiring, beating [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson's]] [[1975\u201376 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]] team 83\u201376.

In 1978, Coach Snowden helped transition the basketball program over to the newly formed Pac-10. Snowden could not sustain success in the Pac-10, however, finishing no higher than 4th place in the conference. His 9\u201318 final season led UA to look for a replacement.<ref name=\"Barker\" />\n\nKnown for his high-octane offense and remembered as a trailblazer, Fred \"The Fox\" Snowden brought excitement to Arizona basketball during his 10-year tenure as the program's head coach. Snowden, who led the Wildcats from 1972\u201382, was the first African-American head basketball coach at an NCAA Division I institution, amassing a 167\u2013108 mark. The 1973 Western Athletic Conference Coach of the Year, his career winning percentage of .607 has been topped by only three UA coaches since 1924. Nicknamed \"The Fox\" due to his cool demeanor, Snowden led Arizona to three postseason berths, including the 1975 National Commissioners\u2019 Invitational Tournament and the 1976 and 1977 NCAA Tournaments. His best season came in 1976, when the Wildcats went 24\u20139, won the Western Athletic Conference championship and advanced to the NCAA West Regional Final. The Brewton, Ala., native was the head coach who led Arizona into the Pac-10 in the 1978\u201379 season, guiding the program for its first four seasons in the Conference. Snowden also oversaw the transition into the McKale Center after its opening in 1973. He was inducted into the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame in 1988. Prior to his role at Arizona, Snowden was an assistant coach at Michigan. He also served on the coaching staff of his high school, Northwestern High School in Detroit, Mich., where he coached for five years after attending Wayne State University from 1954\u201358. Snowden died in 1994 at the age of 57.\n\nAthletic Director Dave Strack brought in [[Ben Lindsey (basketball)|Ben Lindsey]] to replace Fred Snowden in 1983, and on the surface, it seemed like a reasonable move. Lindsey had junior college expertise, having had a successful career at [[Grand Canyon University]], where he won two national titles.  What resulted, however, was nothing short of disaster. The 1983 team finished with the worst season in school history at 4\u201324, with only one Pac-10 win.<ref name=\"Barker\" />\n\n=== Lute Olson era ===\n\n==== Early years ====\nNewly hired UA Athletic director [[Cedric Dempsey]] fired Lindsey after only one season and hired [[Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball|University of Iowa]] coach Lute Olson as his successor.  UA needed a coach with a history of quickly turning around programs, which Olson had done previously at Iowa.  \"I knew we had a tremendous amount of work to do\", Olson recalled in a recent interview with Tucson Lifestyle.  \"The program was in shambles at that point, after the terrible year before...\"<ref name=\"Barker\" />\n\n[[File:Sean Elliott 1988 Arizona Basketball.JPG|thumb|right|300px|All-American Sean Elliott won several national college basketball awards and set the school's scoring record while helping lead the Wildcats to the Final Four in 1988.]]\nUnder Olson, Arizona quickly rose to national prominence. Arizona won its first Pac-10 title in 1986, only three years after his arrival.<ref name=\"Barker\" />  That season set up an amazing 1987\u201388 season, which included taking the [[Great Alaska Shootout]] championship, the Valley Bank Fiesta Bowl Classic championship and the Pac-10 championship.<ref name=\"Barker\" />  Under players [[Steve Kerr]], [[Kenny Lofton]] and [[Sean Elliott]], Arizona spent much of the season ranked No. 1 and made their first (and Olson's second) Final Four.<ref name=\"Barker\" />  While Arizona lost in the Final Four round, their play put the program on the map and launched Arizona's reign as a perennial Pac-10 and NCAA tournament contender. Sean Elliott was awarded the John R. Wooden Award on the season and would set the PAC-10 scoring record.<ref name=\"Barker\" />\n\nIn 1997, Arizona defeated the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|University of Kentucky]], the defending national champions, to win the NCAA National Championship. Prior to winning the championship in 1997, Arizona stormed back from 10-point deficits in the Southeast Regional First Round and Second Round against #13 [[South Alabama Jaguars men's basketball|South Alabama]] and #12 [[College of Charleston Cougars men's basketball|College of Charleston]], respectively winning 65\u201357 and 73\u201369. The Southeast Regional Semifinal pitted against overall #1 Kansas (34\u20131) which had defeated Arizona the year before in the 1996 West Regional Semifinal. However, Arizona came out fast and stunned the [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Jayhawks]] 85\u201382, then prevailed in overtime against [[Providence Friars men's basketball|Providence]] 96\u201392 in the Elite Eight to clinch a berth in the Final Four. Arizona then beat #1 seed [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] 66\u201358 in the Final Four, which turned out to be [[Dean Smith]]'s last game as a coach. Arizona also accomplished the unprecedented feat of beating three number one seeds in the 1997 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. This feat has never been accomplished by another team.\n\nThe year following the Championship season, 1998, Arizona returned all 5 starters ([[Mike Bibby]], [[Michael Dickerson]], [[Miles Simon]], [[Bennett Davison]], and [[A.

Lute Olson's wife Bobbi, well known to players and fans alike as a steadfast presence on the sidelines, lost her battle with cancer. The team, which had been a preseason pick by many to win the national title had to play without Olson for three weeks while Olson was on bereavement leave. The Cats vowed to dedicate their season to Bobbi. With guard [[Jason Gardner]], center [[Loren Woods]] and forward [[Michael Wright (basketball)|Michael Wright]] \u2014 each an All-American \u2014 leading the way, the Cats trounced their opponents, beating Oregon 104\u201365, devastating USC 105\u201361, and charging through the [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Final Four]]. They took down Eastern Illinois, [[Butler Bulldogs men's basketball|Butler]], Mississippi, [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]], and [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]], only to be stopped by [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] in the title game. While being considered the favorite to win the title, which would have been Coach Olsen's 2nd and tied him with Coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]], his opponent, the Blue Devils claimed a ten-point victory in the game. This is the last game Coach Olsen ever coached in the Final Four and is considered by fans of the program to be his most bitter defeat. A championship would have vaulted him into hallowed ground among coaches, being one of few with multiple titles. Instead he remains tied with many coaches who have a single championship ring to their name. Meanwhile, his opponent in that game now is in second place among college coaches with five championship rings, behind only John Wooden's ten. All five of Krzyzewski's titles came in the 64 team field era; Wooden none. Still Coach Olsen earned the respect of his contemporary, Coach K said in the post game interview that \"Arizona had a great team and an amazing season and was worthy of winning the championship, lets give a hand to Coach Olsen and his team.\" The comment drew rousing applause from the audience in attendance and made Coach Olsen proud, even in defeat, to be honored as an equal by Coach Krzyzewski who many claim is the best coach in college history.\n\nIn his later years at UA, Olson fielded competitive teams with extremely talented point guards. Continuing the reputation and nickname \"Point Guard U,\"<ref name=\"Point Guard U\" /> recent standouts include [[Jason Gardner]], [[Salim Stoudamire]], [[Mustafa Shakur]], [[Jerryd Bayless]] and [[Nic Wise]]. Arizona would win Olson's last Pac-10 title during the 2004\u20132005 season under the spectacular play of seniors Salim Stoudamire and center [[Channing Frye]]. That team also made it to the Elite 8 and the verge of the Final Four before blowing a 15-point lead with four minutes to play and losing in overtime, 90\u201389, to the No. 1 seed and eventual national runner-up, [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|University of Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=254000061 | title=Arizona 89, Illinois 90 | publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2008-03-30 }}</ref>\n\nOlson took an unexplained leave of absence at the beginning of the 2007\u20132008 season.

[[The Pride of Arizona]] pep band and the [[Zona Zoo]].\n* Before every game, the band splits into four sections in the four sides of McKale Center. They play [[Bear Down]] Arizona in sequence before the band runs back to the student section in the north stands and plays all of Bear Down. The band also yells \"Hi fans!\" to the fans, who respond by yelling \"Hi band!\" and \"Hi Sean!\" to head coach [[Sean Miller]], who responds by waving to the band. The band also yells \"Hi Adia!\" to Arizona women's basketball coach [[Adia Barnes]].\n* While the opposing team's players are being introduced, the student section turns their backs to the court. As each player's name is announced, they will yell \"Sucks!\" In the interest of sportsmanship, though, the Athletic Department is attempting to phase this tradition out.\n* At the start of each half, the entire crowd will stand until the other team scores a point. The fans will also clap rhythmically with the band as it plays a four-note refrain repeatedly until the ball is tipped or inbounded.\n* During the first four minutes of each half, or until the first media timeout, the band and students have several chants.\n** Every time an opposing player dribbles, the yell is \"Boing!\"\n** Every time they pass, the yell is \"Pass!\"\n** Every time they try to shoot, the yell is \"Brick!\"\n* When an opposing player fouls an Arizona player, the band and students chant, while pointing at the opposing player, \"You! You! You! You! You! You! You! You! You! On you, that's who!\" If the foul occurs during a shot and the player makes the shot, the chant is instead \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! No no no no! No no no no! No no no no! No no no no! Don't touch me!\"\n* If an opposing player accrues four fouls during the game, they will chant \"Four!\" four times while waving four fingers. If a player fouls out, the band plays the beat from \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\", concluding with the band and students yelling \"Hey! We're gonna get you too!\"\n* When opposing players are attempting foul shots, besides attempting to distract the player, the band and students have several chants, but the only constant one is yelled if the player misses their first shot of a two-shot foul, in which case they yell \"Nice shot, buddy!\"\n* If Arizona is beating an opponent by a comfortable margin late in the game, the band and students will chant \"Go start the bus!\" repeatedly. If an opponent makes a big play, they will chant \"It just doesn't matter!\"\n* Since the 1980s, the \"Ooh Aah Man\" Joe Cavaleri has made appearances at McKale to pump up the crowd. He starts by spelling out \"A-R-I-Z-O-N-A!\" with his body as the crowd chants along. He then directs the crowd in chanting \"U of A!\", first by each side of the arena, then by the north and south sides and east and west sides simultaneously then by the whole arena. His routine usually involves pulling off his shirt and pants to reveal another Arizona shirt and shorts underneath. Unfortunately, Cavaleri was recently diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] and has only made a few appearances during the 2010\u20132011 season.<ref>{{cite news |title=UCLA game thread |author=Pascoe, Bruce |url=http://azstarnet.com/sports/blogs/pascoe/article_bd03b9b2-2a80-11e0-a8c2-001cc4c03286.html |newspaper=Arizona Daily Star |date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=UA's top fan sidelined |author=Hansen, Greg |url=http://azstarnet.com/sports/basketball/college/wildcats/article_27582e03-9aab-5a35-9155-99e3b30b07d9.html |newspaper=Arizona Daily Star |date=23 December 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=y9atqBD-89M|title=Ooh Aah Man at McKale vs ASU 1/15/11}}</ref>\n* At the end of every home game (and every Arizona athletics event the band is present at) the band plays Arizona's alma mater, \"All Hail, Arizona!\" Students and fans link arms, sway as they sing and jump up and down while singing the last part of the song.\n* The team hosts an annual \"White Out\" game.

In 1978, Coach Snowden helped transition the basketball program over to the newly formed Pac-10. Snowden could not sustain success in the Pac-10, however, finishing no higher than 4th place in the conference. His 9\u201318 final season led UA to look for a replacement.<ref name=\"Barker\" />\n\nKnown for his high-octane offense and remembered as a trailblazer, Fred \"The Fox\" Snowden brought excitement to Arizona basketball during his 10-year tenure as the program's head coach. Snowden, who led the Wildcats from 1972\u201382, was the first African-American head basketball coach at an NCAA Division I institution, amassing a 167\u2013108 mark. The 1973 Western Athletic Conference Coach of the Year, his career winning percentage of .607 has been topped by only three UA coaches since 1924. Nicknamed \"The Fox\" due to his cool demeanor, Snowden led Arizona to three postseason berths, including the 1975 National Commissioners\u2019 Invitational Tournament and the 1976 and 1977 NCAA Tournaments. His best season came in 1976, when the Wildcats went 24\u20139, won the Western Athletic Conference championship and advanced to the NCAA West Regional Final. The Brewton, Ala., native was the head coach who led Arizona into the Pac-10 in the 1978\u201379 season, guiding the program for its first four seasons in the Conference. Snowden also oversaw the transition into the McKale Center after its opening in 1973. He was inducted into the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame in 1988. Prior to his role at Arizona, Snowden was an assistant coach at Michigan. He also served on the coaching staff of his high school, Northwestern High School in Detroit, Mich., where he coached for five years after attending Wayne State University from 1954\u201358. Snowden died in 1994 at the age of 57.\n\nAthletic Director Dave Strack brought in [[Ben Lindsey (basketball)|Ben Lindsey]] to replace Fred Snowden in 1983, and on the surface, it seemed like a reasonable move. Lindsey had junior college expertise, having had a successful career at [[Grand Canyon University]], where he won two national titles.  What resulted, however, was nothing short of disaster.

Sean Elliott was awarded the John R. Wooden Award on the season and would set the PAC-10 scoring record.<ref name=\"Barker\" />\n\nIn 1997, Arizona defeated the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|University of Kentucky]], the defending national champions, to win the NCAA National Championship. Prior to winning the championship in 1997, Arizona stormed back from 10-point deficits in the Southeast Regional First Round and Second Round against #13 [[South Alabama Jaguars men's basketball|South Alabama]] and #12 [[College of Charleston Cougars men's basketball|College of Charleston]], respectively winning 65\u201357 and 73\u201369. The Southeast Regional Semifinal pitted against overall #1 Kansas (34\u20131) which had defeated Arizona the year before in the 1996 West Regional Semifinal. However, Arizona came out fast and stunned the [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Jayhawks]] 85\u201382, then prevailed in overtime against [[Providence Friars men's basketball|Providence]] 96\u201392 in the Elite Eight to clinch a berth in the Final Four. Arizona then beat #1 seed [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] 66\u201358 in the Final Four, which turned out to be [[Dean Smith]]'s last game as a coach. Arizona also accomplished the unprecedented feat of beating three number one seeds in the 1997 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.

Lute Olson's wife Bobbi, well known to players and fans alike as a steadfast presence on the sidelines, lost her battle with cancer. The team, which had been a preseason pick by many to win the national title had to play without Olson for three weeks while Olson was on bereavement leave. The Cats vowed to dedicate their season to Bobbi. With guard [[Jason Gardner]], center [[Loren Woods]] and forward [[Michael Wright (basketball)|Michael Wright]] \u2014 each an All-American \u2014 leading the way, the Cats trounced their opponents, beating Oregon 104\u201365, devastating USC 105\u201361, and charging through the [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Final Four]]. They took down Eastern Illinois, [[Butler Bulldogs men's basketball|Butler]], Mississippi, [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]], and [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]], only to be stopped by [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] in the title game. While being considered the favorite to win the title, which would have been Coach Olsen's 2nd and tied him with Coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]], his opponent, the Blue Devils claimed a ten-point victory in the game. This is the last game Coach Olsen ever coached in the Final Four and is considered by fans of the program to be his most bitter defeat. A championship would have vaulted him into hallowed ground among coaches, being one of few with multiple titles. Instead he remains tied with many coaches who have a single championship ring to their name. Meanwhile, his opponent in that game now is in second place among college coaches with five championship rings, behind only John Wooden's ten. All five of Krzyzewski's titles came in the 64 team field era; Wooden none. Still Coach Olsen earned the respect of his contemporary, Coach K said in the post game interview that \"Arizona had a great team and an amazing season and was worthy of winning the championship, lets give a hand to Coach Olsen and his team.\" The comment drew rousing applause from the audience in attendance and made Coach Olsen proud, even in defeat, to be honored as an equal by Coach Krzyzewski who many claim is the best coach in college history.\n\nIn his later years at UA, Olson fielded competitive teams with extremely talented point guards. Continuing the reputation and nickname \"Point Guard U,\"<ref name=\"Point Guard U\" /> recent standouts include [[Jason Gardner]], [[Salim Stoudamire]], [[Mustafa Shakur]], [[Jerryd Bayless]] and [[Nic Wise]]. Arizona would win Olson's last Pac-10 title during the 2004\u20132005 season under the spectacular play of seniors Salim Stoudamire and center [[Channing Frye]]. That team also made it to the Elite 8 and the verge of the Final Four before blowing a 15-point lead with four minutes to play and losing in overtime, 90\u201389, to the No. 1 seed and eventual national runner-up, [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|University of Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=254000061 | title=Arizona 89, Illinois 90 | publisher=ESPN |date= |accessdate=2008-03-30 }}</ref>\n\nOlson took an unexplained leave of absence at the beginning of the 2007\u20132008 season.

[[The Pride of Arizona]] pep band and the [[Zona Zoo]].\n* Before every game, the band splits into four sections in the four sides of McKale Center. They play [[Bear Down]] Arizona in sequence before the band runs back to the student section in the north stands and plays all of Bear Down. The band also yells \"Hi fans!\" to the fans, who respond by yelling \"Hi band!\" and \"Hi Sean!\" to head coach [[Sean Miller]], who responds by waving to the band. The band also yells \"Hi Adia!\" to Arizona women's basketball coach [[Adia Barnes]].\n* While the opposing team's players are being introduced, the student section turns their backs to the court. As each player's name is announced, they will yell \"Sucks!\" In the interest of sportsmanship, though, the Athletic Department is attempting to phase this tradition out.\n* At the start of each half, the entire crowd will stand until the other team scores a point. The fans will also clap rhythmically with the band as it plays a four-note refrain repeatedly until the ball is tipped or inbounded.\n* During the first four minutes of each half, or until the first media timeout, the band and students have several chants.\n** Every time an opposing player dribbles, the yell is \"Boing!\"\n** Every time they pass, the yell is \"Pass!\"\n** Every time they try to shoot, the yell is \"Brick!\"\n* When an opposing player fouls an Arizona player, the band and students chant, while pointing at the opposing player, \"You! You! You! You! You! You! You! You! You! On you, that's who!\" If the foul occurs during a shot and the player makes the shot, the chant is instead \"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! No no no no! No no no no! No no no no! No no no no! Don't touch me!\"\n* If an opposing player accrues four fouls during the game, they will chant \"Four!\" four times while waving four fingers. If a player fouls out, the band plays the beat from \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\", concluding with the band and students yelling \"Hey! We're gonna get you too!\"\n* When opposing players are attempting foul shots, besides attempting to distract the player, the band and students have several chants, but the only constant one is yelled if the player misses their first shot of a two-shot foul, in which case they yell \"Nice shot, buddy!\"\n* If Arizona is beating an opponent by a comfortable margin late in the game, the band and students will chant \"Go start the bus!\" repeatedly. If an opponent makes a big play, they will chant \"It just doesn't matter!\"\n* Since the 1980s, the \"Ooh Aah Man\" Joe Cavaleri has made appearances at McKale to pump up the crowd. He starts by spelling out \"A-R-I-Z-O-N-A!\" with his body as the crowd chants along. He then directs the crowd in chanting \"U of A!\", first by each side of the arena, then by the north and south sides and east and west sides simultaneously then by the whole arena. His routine usually involves pulling off his shirt and pants to reveal another Arizona shirt and shorts underneath. Unfortunately, Cavaleri was recently diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] and has only made a few appearances during the 2010\u20132011 season.<ref>{{cite news |title=UCLA game thread |author=Pascoe, Bruce |url=http://azstarnet.com/sports/blogs/pascoe/article_bd03b9b2-2a80-11e0-a8c2-001cc4c03286.html |newspaper=Arizona Daily Star |date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=UA's top fan sidelined |author=Hansen, Greg |url=http://azstarnet.com/sports/basketball/college/wildcats/article_27582e03-9aab-5a35-9155-99e3b30b07d9.html |newspaper=Arizona Daily Star |date=23 December 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=y9atqBD-89M|title=Ooh Aah Man at McKale vs ASU 1/15/11}}</ref>\n* At the end of every home game (and every Arizona athletics event the band is present at) the band plays Arizona's alma mater, \"All Hail, Arizona!\" Students and fans link arms, sway as they sing and jump up and down while singing the last part of the song.\n* The team hosts an annual \"White Out\" game. All fans are encouraged to wear white T-shirts. The most recent white out game was on December 7, 2013, versus UNLV.
