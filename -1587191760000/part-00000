limit}}\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Deaf videoconference.jpg|thumb|A deaf person using a camera-equipped smartphone to communicate in sign language.]]\n*Hearing loss exists when there is diminished acuity to sounds normally heard.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> The terms hearing impaired or hard of hearing are usually reserved for people who have relative inability to hear sound in the speech frequencies. The severity of a hearing loss is categorized according to the increase in intensity of sound above the usual level necessary before the listener can detect it.\n*Deafness is defined as a degree of loss such that a person is unable to understand speech even in the presence of amplification.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> In profound deafness, even the highest intensity sounds produced by an [[audiometer]] (an instrument used to measure hearing by producing pure tone sounds through a range of frequencies) may not be detected. In total deafness, no sounds at all, regardless of amplification or method of production, are heard.\n*[[Speech perception]] \u2013 Another aspect of hearing involves the perceived clarity of a word rather than the intensity of sound made by the word. In humans, that aspect is usually measured by tests of speech discrimination. These tests measure one's ability to understand speech, not to merely detect sound. There are very rare types of hearing loss which affect speech discrimination alone.  One example is [[auditory neuropathy]], a variety of hearing loss in which the outer hair cells of the cochlea are intact and functioning, but sound information is not faithfully transmitted to the auditory nerve and brain properly.<ref name=\"eBook1\">eBook: ''Current Diagnosis & Treatment in Otolaryngology: Head & Neck Surgery'', Lalwani, Anil K.

Sound is generally uncomfortably loud above 90&nbsp;dB and 115&nbsp;dB represents the [[threshold of pain]]. The ear does not hear all frequencies equally well; hearing sensitivity peaks around 3000&nbsp;Hz.  There are many qualities of human hearing besides frequency range and intensity that cannot easily be measured quantitatively. But for many practical purposes, normal hearing is defined by a frequency versus intensity graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity thresholds of hearing at defined frequencies.  Because of the cumulative impact of age and exposure to noise and other acoustic insults, 'typical' hearing may not be normal.<ref>ANSI 7029:2000/BS 6951 Acoustics - Statistical distribution of hearing thresholds as a function of age</ref><ref>ANSI S3.5-1997 Speech Intelligibility Index (SII)</ref>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n*difficulty using the [[telephone]]\n*loss of [[Sound localization|directionality of sound]]\n*difficulty [[Speech perception|understanding speech]], especially of children and women whose voices are of a [[Voice frequency#Fundamental frequency|higher frequency]].\n*difficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise ([[cocktail party effect]])\n*sounds or speech becoming dull, muffled or attenuated\n*need for increased volume on television, radio, music and other audio sources\n\nHearing loss is sensory, but may have accompanying symptoms:\n*pain or pressure in the ears\n*a blocked feeling\n\nThere may also be accompanying secondary symptoms:\n*[[hyperacusis]], heightened sensitivity with accompanying auditory pain to certain intensities and frequencies of sound, sometimes defined as \"[[auditory recruitment]]\"\n*[[tinnitus]], ringing, buzzing, hissing or other sounds in the ear when no external sound is present\n*[[vertigo]] and disequilibrium\n*[[Autophony|tympanophonia]], also known as autophonia, abnormal hearing of one's own voice and respiratory sounds, usually as a result of a patulous (a constantly open) eustachian tube or dehiscent superior semicircular canals\n*disturbances of facial movement (indicating a possible tumour or stroke) or in persons with [[Bell's palsy|Bell's Palsy]]\n\n=== Complications ===\nHearing loss is associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[dementia]].

As ageing and other effects contribute to higher frequency loss (6\u20138&nbsp;kHz on an audiogram), this notch may be obscured and entirely disappear.\n\nVarious governmental, industry and standards organizations set noise standards.<ref>In the United States, [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]], and numerous state government agencies among others, set noise standards.</ref>\n\nThe [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has identified the level of 70&nbsp;dB(A) (40% louder to twice as loud as normal conversation; typical level of TV, radio, stereo; city street noise) for 24\u2011hour exposure as the level necessary to protect the public from hearing loss and other disruptive effects from noise, such as sleep disturbance, stress-related problems, learning detriment, etc.<ref>Information on Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety.

Estimation of a \"safe\" duration of exposure is possible using an ''exchange rate'' of 3&nbsp;dB. As 3&nbsp;dB represents a doubling of the intensity of sound, duration of exposure must be cut in half to maintain the same energy dose. For workplace noise regulation, the \"safe\" daily exposure amount at 85&nbsp;dB A, known as an [[exposure action value]], is 8 hours, while the \"safe\" exposure at 91&nbsp;dB(A) is only 2 hours.<ref>Occupational Noise Exposure, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 98-126</ref>\nDifferent standards use exposure action values between 80dBA and 90dBA. Note that for some people, sound may be damaging at even lower levels than 85&nbsp;dB A. Exposures to other ototoxins (such as pesticides, some medications including chemotherapy agents, solvents, etc.) can lead to greater susceptibility to noise damage, as well as causing its own damage. This is called a ''synergistic'' interaction.  Since noise damage is cumulative over long periods of time, persons who are exposed to non-workplace noise, like recreational activities or environmental noise, may have compounding damage from all sources.\n\nSome national and international organizations and agencies use an exchange rate of 4&nbsp;dB or 5&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| title=Compliance Guide to MSHA's Occupational Noise Exposure Standard, APPENDIX B \u2013 GLOSSARY OF TERMS| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112204458/http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| archive-date=2013-11-12| access-date=2013-11-12}}</ref> While these exchange rates may indicate a wider zone of comfort or safety, they can significantly underestimate the damage caused by loud noise. For example, at 100&nbsp;dB (nightclub music level), a 3&nbsp;dB exchange rate would limit exposure to 15 minutes; the 5&nbsp;dB exchange rate allows an hour.\n\nMany people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels, or of the level at which sound becomes harmful. Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children's toys, motor vehicles, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, musical instruments, and even hair dryers. Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk. If one is exposed to loud sound (including music) at high levels or for extended durations (85&nbsp;dB A or greater), then hearing loss will occur. Sound intensity (sound energy, or propensity to cause damage to the ears) increases dramatically with proximity according to an inverse square law: halving the distance to the sound quadruples the sound intensity.\n\nIn the US, 12.5% of children aged 6\u201319 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure.<ref name=\"kid\">{{cite web| url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss: Promoting Hearing Health Among Youth| work=CDC Healthy Youth!| publisher=CDC| date=2009-07-01| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221020243/http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| archive-date=2009-12-21}}</ref>  The World Health Organization estimates that half of those between 12 and 35 are at risk from using [[personal audio devices]] that are too loud.<ref name=WHO2015Aud/>\n\nHearing loss due to noise has been described as primarily a condition of modern society.<ref name=Go2007>{{cite journal| last1=Goines| first1=Lisa| last2=Hagler| first2=Louis| name-list-format = vanc | title=Noise Pollution: A Modern Plague| journal=Southern Medical Journal| date=March 2007| volume=100| issue=3| pages=287\u2013294 | citeseerx=10.1.1.504.8717| doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e3180318be5| pmid=17396733}}</ref> In preindustrial times, humans had far less exposure to loud sounds.

Diagnosis of the cause of a hearing loss is carried out by a specialist physician (audiovestibular physician) or [[otorhinolaryngologist]].\n\n===Case history===\nA case history (usually a written form, with questionnaire) can provide valuable information about the context of the hearing loss, and indicate what kind of diagnostic procedures to employ.

Hearing sensitivity varies according to the [[frequency]] of sounds. To take this into account, hearing sensitivity can be measured for a range of frequencies and plotted on an [[audiogram]].\n\nOther method for quantifying hearing loss is a [[hearing test]] using a mobile application or [[hearing aid application]], which includes a [[hearing test]].<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shojaeemend H, Ayatollahi H | title = Automated Audiometry: A Review of the Implementation and Evaluation Methods | journal = Healthcare Informatics Research | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 263\u2013275 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30443414 | pmc = 6230538 | doi = 10.4258/hir.2018.24.4.263 }}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Keidser G, Convery E | title = Self-Fitting Hearing Aids: Status Quo and Future Predictions | journal = Trends in Hearing | volume = 20 | pages = 233121651664328 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27072929 | pmc = 4871211 | doi = 10.1177/2331216516643284 }}</ref> Hearing diagnosis using mobile application is similar to the [[audiometry]] procedure.

As the name implies, a speech-in-noise test gives an indication of how well one can understand speech in a noisy environment. A person with a hearing loss will often be less able to understand speech, especially in noisy conditions. This is especially true for people who have a sensorineural loss \u2013 which is by far the most common type of hearing loss. As such, speech-in-noise tests can provide valuable information about a person's hearing ability, and can be used to detect the presence of a sensorineural hearing loss. A recently developed digit-triple speech-in-noise test may be a more efficient screening test.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jansen S, Luts H, Dejonckere P, van Wieringen A, Wouters J | title = Efficient hearing screening in noise-exposed listeners using the digit triplet test | journal = Ear and Hearing | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 773\u20138 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23782715 | doi = 10.1097/AUD.0b013e318297920b | url = https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/398543/2/Jansen_Ear%26Hearing_2013.pdf }}</ref>\n\nOtoacoustic emissions test is an objective hearing test that may be administered to toddlers and children too young to cooperate in a conventional hearing test. The test is also useful in older children and adults and is an important measure in diagnosing auditory neuropathy described above.\n\nAuditory brainstem response testing is an electrophysiological test used to test for hearing deficits caused by pathology within the ear, the cochlear nerve and also within the brainstem. This test can be used to identify delay in the conduction of neural impulses due to tumours or inflammation but can also be an objective test of hearing thresholds. Other electrophysiological tests, such as cortical evoked responses, can look at the hearing pathway up to the level of the auditory cortex.\n\n===Scans===\n{{contradictory|date=August 2019}}\nMRI and CT scans can be useful to identify the pathology of many causes of hearing loss. They are only needed in selected cases.{{vague|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Classification===\nHearing loss is categorized by type, severity, and configuration. Furthermore, a hearing loss may exist in only one ear (unilateral) or in both ears (bilateral).  Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent, sudden or progressive.\n\n====Severity====\nThe severity of a hearing loss is ranked according to ranges of nominal thresholds in which a sound must be so it can be detected by an individual. It is measured in [[decibel]]s of hearing loss, or dB HL. The measurement of hearing loss in an individual is conducted over several [[frequency|frequencies]], mostly 500&nbsp;Hz, 1000&nbsp;Hz, 2000&nbsp;Hz and 4000&nbsp;Hz. The hearing loss of the individual is the average of the hearing loss values over the different frequencies. Hearing loss can be ranked differently according to different organisations; and so, in different countries different systems are in use.\n\nHearing loss may be ranked as slight, mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound as defined below:{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n* Slight: between 16 and 25&nbsp;dB HL\n* Mild:\n** for adults: between 26 and 40&nbsp;dB HL\n** for children: between 20 and 40&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Moderate: between 41 and 54&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Moderately severe: between 55 and 70&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Severe: between 71 and 90&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Profound: 91&nbsp;dB HL or greater<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Totally deaf: Have no hearing at all.  This is called ''anacusis''.\n\nThe 'Audiometric Classifications of Hearing Impairment' according to the International Bureau Audiophonology (BIAP) in Belgium is as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=BIAP Recommendation 02/1 bis - AUDIOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF HEARING IMPAIRMENTS|url=https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|website=biap.org|publisher=International Bureau Audiophonology|access-date=18 June 2017|date=26 October 1996|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908010426/https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref>\n* Normal or subnormal hearing: average tone loss is equal or below 20&nbsp;dB HL\n* Mild hearing loss: average tone loss between 21 and 40&nbsp;dB HL\n* Moderate hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 41 and 55&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 56 and 70&nbsp;dB HL\n* Severe hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 71 and 80&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 81 and 90&nbsp;dB HL\n* Very severe hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 91 and 100&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 101 and 110&nbsp;dB HL\n** Third degree: average tone loss between 111 and 119&nbsp;dB HL\n* Total hearing loss or Cophosis: average tone loss is equal or more than 120&nbsp;dB HL\n\nHearing loss may affect one or both ears. If both ears are affected, then one ear may be more affected than the other.  Thus it is possible, for example, to have normal hearing in one ear and none at all in the other, or to have mild hearing loss in one ear and moderate hearing loss in the other.\n\nFor certain legal purposes such as insurance claims, hearing loss is described in terms of percentages. Given that hearing loss can vary by frequency and that audiograms are plotted with a logarithmic scale, the idea of a percentage of hearing loss is somewhat arbitrary, but where decibels of loss are converted via a legally recognized formula, it is possible to calculate a standardized \"percentage of hearing loss\", which is suitable for legal purposes only.\n\n====Type====\nThere are three main types of hearing loss, [[conductive hearing loss]], [[sensorineural hearing loss]]. Combinations of conductive and sensorineural hearing losses are called a mixed hearing loss.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is [[auditory processing disorder]] which is not a hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound.\n\n*Conductive hearing loss\nConductive hearing loss is present when the sound is not reaching the inner ear, the [[cochlea]]. This can be due to external ear canal malformation, dysfunction of the eardrum or malfunction of the bones of the middle ear. The eardrum may show defects from small to total resulting in hearing loss of different degree. [[Granulation tissue|Scar tissue]] after ear infections may also make the eardrum dysfunction as well as when it is retracted and adherent to the medial part of the middle ear.\n\nDysfunction of the three small bones of the [[middle ear]] \u2013 malleus, incus, and stapes \u2013 may cause conductive hearing loss. The mobility of the [[ossicles]] may be impaired for different reasons including a boney disorder of the ossicles called [[otosclerosis]] and disruption of the ossicular chain due to trauma, infection or [[ankylosis]] may also cause hearing loss.\n\n*Sensorineural hearing loss\nSensorineural hearing loss is one caused by dysfunction of the inner ear, the cochlea or the nerve that transmits the impulses from the cochlea to the hearing centre in the brain. The most common reason for sensorineural hearing loss is damage to the [[hair cells]] in the cochlea. Depending on the definition it could be estimated that more than 50% of the population over the age of 70 has impaired hearing.<ref name=\"RussellPineYoung2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell JL, Pine HS, Young DL | title = Pediatric cochlear implantation: expanding applications and outcomes | journal = Pediatric Clinics of North America | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 841\u201363 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23905823 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2013.04.008 }}</ref>\n\n*Central deafness\nDamage to the brain can lead to a central deafness. The peripheral ear and the auditory nerve may function well but the central connections are damaged by tumour, trauma or other disease and the patient is unable to process speech information.\n\n*Mixed hearing loss\nMixed hearing loss is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Chronic ear infection (a fairly common diagnosis) can cause a defective [[ear drum]] or middle-ear ossicle damages, or both.  In addition to the conductive loss, a sensory component may be present.\n\n*Central [[auditory processing disorder]]\n\nThis is not an actual hearing loss but gives rise to significant difficulties in hearing. One kind of auditory processing disorder is [[King-Kopetzky syndrome]], which is characterized by an inability to process out background noise in noisy environments despite normal performance on traditional hearing tests. An [[auditory processing disorder]]s is sometimes linked to language disorders in persons of all ages.\n\n====Configuration====\nThe shape of an audiogram shows the relative configuration of the hearing loss, such as a [[Carhart notch]] for otosclerosis, 'noise' notch for noise-induced damage, high frequency rolloff for presbycusis, or a flat audiogram for conductive hearing loss. In conjunction with speech audiometry, it may indicate central auditory processing disorder, or the presence of a [[schwannoma]] or other tumor.\nThere are four general configurations of hearing loss:\n\n1. Flat: thresholds essentially equal across test frequencies.\n\n2. Sloping: lower (better) thresholds in low-frequency regions and higher (poorer) thresholds in high-frequency regions.\n\n3. Rising: higher (poorer) thresholds in low-frequency regions and lower (better) thresholds in higher-frequency regions.\n\n4. Trough-shaped (\"cookie-bite\" or \"U\" shaped): greatest hearing loss in the mid-frequency range, with lower (better) thresholds in low- and high-frequency regions.\n\n====Unilateral and bilateral====\nPeople with [[unilateral hearing loss]] or single-sided deafness (SSD) have difficulty in:\n\n*hearing conversation on their impaired side\n*localizing sound\n*understanding speech in the presence of background noise.\n\nIn quiet conditions, speech discrimination is approximately the same for normal hearing and those with unilateral deafness; however, in noisy environments speech discrimination varies individually and ranges from mild to severe.\n\nOne reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the [[head shadow effect]]. Newborn children with no hearing on one side but one normal ear could still have problems.<ref name=\"pmid15148171\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lieu JE | title = Speech-language and educational consequences of unilateral hearing loss in children | journal = Archives of Otolaryngology\u2013Head & Neck Surgery | volume = 130 | issue = 5 | pages = 524\u201330 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15148171 | doi = 10.1001/archotol.130.5.524 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Speech development could be delayed and difficulties to concentrate in school are common.

Ear protection, if used correctly, can reduce noise to safer levels, but often, providing them is not sufficient to prevent hearing loss. Engineering noise out and other solutions such as proper maintenance of equipment can lead to noise reduction, but further field studies on resulting noise exposures following such interventions are needed. Other possible solutions include improved enforcement of existing legislation and better implementation of well-designed prevention programmes, which have not yet been proven conclusively to be effective.

For the most part, there is little objection to those who lost their hearing later in life, or culturally deaf adults choosing to be fitted with a cochlear implant.<ref name=Spa2005/>\n\nMany in the deaf community strongly object to a deaf child being fitted with a cochlear implant (often on the advice of an audiologist); new parents may not have sufficient information on raising deaf children and placed in an oral-only program that emphasizes the ability to speak and listen over other forms of communication such as [[sign language]] or [[total communication]]. Many deaf people view cochlear implants and other hearing devices as confusing to one's identity. They feel a deaf person will never be a hearing person and therefore would be trying to fit into a way of living that is not their own. Other concerns include loss of [[deaf culture]] and identity and limitations on hearing restoration.<ref name=Spa2005/>\n\nJack Gannon, a professor at [[Gallaudet University]], said this about [[Deaf culture]]: \"Deaf culture is a set of learned behaviors and perceptions that shape the values and norms of deaf people based on their shared or common experiences.\" Some doctors believe that being deaf makes a person more social. Bill Vicar, from ASL University, shared his experiences as a deaf person, \"[deaf people] tend to congregate around the kitchen table rather than the living room sofa... our good-byes take nearly forever, and our hellos often consist of serious hugs. When two of us meet for the first time we tend to exchange detailed biographies.\"<ref>Deaf Heritage: A Narrative History of Deaf America by Jack Gannon (National Association of the Deaf, 1981)</ref> Deaf culture is not about contemplating what deaf people cannot do and how to fix their problems, an approach known as the \"pathological view of the deaf.\"<ref name=pathological>{{cite web|title=American Deaf Culture|url=http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|work=Sign Media, Incorporated|publisher=Sign Media, Inc|access-date=14 May 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522030209/http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|archive-date=22 May 2013}}</ref> Instead deaf people celebrate what they can do. There is a strong sense of unity between deaf people as they share their experiences of suffering through a similar struggle. This celebration creates a unity between even deaf strangers.

Much of the negative reaction to cochlear implants stems from the medical viewpoint that deafness is a condition that needs to be \"cured,\" while the Deaf community instead regards deafness a defining cultural characteristic.\n\nMany other assistive devices are more acceptable to the Deaf community, including but not limited to, hearing aids, [[closed captioning]], email and the Internet, text telephones, and video relay services.\n\n==Sign language==\n{{Main|Sign language}}\n[[File:Drawing (sign language friend), 2008.jpg|thumb|The sign language for \"friend\".]]\nSign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns.

An argument supporting inclusion, on the other hand, exposes the student to people who are not just like them, preparing them for adult life. Through interacting, children with hearing disabilities can expose themselves to other cultures which in the future may be beneficial for them when it comes to finding jobs and living on their own in a society where their disability may put them in the minority. These are some reasons why a person may or may not want to put their child in an inclusion classroom.<ref name=\"SmithDD2010\" />\n\n====Family====\nThe communication limitations between people who are deaf and their hearing family members can often cause difficulties in family relationships, and affect the strength of relationships among individual family members. It was found that most people who are deaf have hearing parents, which means that the channel that the child and parents communicate through can be very different, often affecting their relationship in a negative way. If a parent communicates best verbally, and their child communicates best using sign language, this could result in ineffective communication between parents and children. Ineffective communication can potentially lead to fights caused by misunderstanding, less willingness to talk about life events and issues, and an overall weaker relationship. Even if individuals in the family made an effort to learn deaf communication techniques such as sign language, a deaf family member often will feel excluded from casual banter; such as the exchange of daily events and news at the dinner table. It is often difficult for people who are deaf to follow these conversations due to the fast-paced and overlapping nature of these exchanges. This can cause a deaf individual to become frustrated and take part in less family conversations. This can potentially result in weaker relationships between the hearing individual and their immediate family members. This communication barrier can have a particularly negative effect on relationships with extended family members as well. Communication between a deaf individual and their extended family members can be very difficult due to the gap in verbal and non-verbal communication. This can cause the individuals to feel frustrated and unwilling to put effort into communicating effectively. The lack of effort put into communicating can result in anger, miscommunication, and unwillingness to build a strong relationship.<ref name=\"FOSTER\">{{cite book | vauthors = Foster S | date = 1996 | chapter = Communication experiences of deaf people: An ethnographic account. | veditors = Parasnis I | title = Cultural and language diversity of the deaf experience | pages = 117\u2013136 | location = New York | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}</ref>\n\n====Community====\n[[File:Alexander Graham Bell and his Scott Circle School.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Graham Bell]] with teachers and students of the Scott Circle School for deaf children, Washington, D.C., 1883]]\nPeople who have hearing loss can often experience many difficulties as a result of communication barriers among them and other hearing individuals in the community. Some major areas that can be impacted by this are involvement in extracurricular activities and social relationships. For young people, extracurricular activities are vehicles for physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development. However, it is often the case that communication barriers between people who are deaf and their hearing peers and coaches/club advisors limit them from getting involved. These communication barriers make it difficult for someone with a hearing loss to understand directions, take advice, collaborate, and form bonding relationships with other team or club members. As a result, extracurricular activities such as sports teams, clubs, and volunteering are often not as enjoyable and beneficial for individuals who have hearing loss, and they may engage in them less often. A lack of community involvement through extracurricular activities may also limit the individual's social network. In general, it can be difficult for someone who is deaf to develop and maintain friendships with their hearing peers due to the communication gap that they experience. They can often miss the jokes, informal banter, and \"messing around\" that is associated with the formation of many friendships among young people. Conversations between people who are deaf and their hearing peers can often be limited and short due to their differences in communication methods and lack of knowledge on how to overcome these differences. Deaf individuals can often experience rejection by hearing peers who are not willing to make an effort to find their way around communication difficulties. Patience and motivation to overcome such communication barriers is required by both the deaf or hard of hearing and hearing individuals in order to establish and maintain good friendships.<ref name=\"FOSTER\" />\n\nMany people tend to forget about the difficulties that deaf children encounter, as they view the deaf child differently from a deaf adult. Deaf children grow up being unable to fully communicate with their parents, siblings and other family members. Examples include being unable to tell their family what they have learned, what they did, asking for help, or even simply being unable to interact in daily conversation. Deaf children have to learn sign language and to read lips at a young age, however they cannot communicate with others using it unless the others are educated in sign language as well. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing are faced with many complications while growing up, for example some children have to wear hearing aids and others require assistance from sign language (ASL) interpreters. The interpreters help them to communicate with other individuals until they develop the skills they need to efficiently communicate on their own. Although growing up for deaf children may entitle more difficulties than for other children, there are many support groups that allow deaf children to interact with other children. This is where they develop friendships. There are also classes for young children to learn sign language in an environment that has other children in their same situation and around their same age. These groups and classes can be very beneficial in providing the child with the proper knowledge and not to mention the societal interactions that they need in order to live a healthy, young, playful and carefree life that any child deserves.\n\nThere are three typical adjustment patterns adopted by adults with hearing loss. The first one is to remain withdrawn into your own self. This provides a sense of safety and familiarity which can be a comforting way to lead your life. The second is to act \"as if\" one does not even have hearing loss. A positive attitude will help people to live a life with no barriers and thus, engage in optimal interaction. The final and third pattern is for the person to accept their hearing loss as a part of them without undervaluing oneself. This means understanding that one is forced to live life with this disability, however it is not the only thing that constitutes life's meaning. Furthermore, many feel as if their inability to hear others during conversation is their fault. It's important that these individuals learn how to become more assertive individuals who do not lack fear when it comes to asking someone to repeat something or to speak a little louder. Although there is much fatigue and frustration that is produced from one's inability to hear, it is important to learn from personal experiences in order to improve on one's communication skills. In essence, these patterns will help adults with hearing loss deal with the communication barriers that are present.<ref name=\"SCHERER\">{{cite book | vauthors = Scherer MJ | date = 2004 | chapter = The Personal Meaning of Hearing or Vision Loss. | title = Connecting To Learn Educational and Assistive Technology for People With Disabilities | pages = 41\u201355 | location = Washington, DC | publisher = American Psychological Association }}</ref>\n\n====Workplace====\nIn most instances, people who are deaf find themselves working with hearing colleagues, where they can often be cut off from the communication going on around them. Interpreters can be provided for meetings and workshops, however are seldom provided for everyday work interactions. Communication of important information needed for jobs typically comes in the form of written or verbal summaries, which do not convey subtle meanings such as tone of voice, side conversations during group discussions, and body language. This can result in confusion and misunderstanding for the worker who is deaf, therefore making it harder to do their job effectively. Additionally, deaf workers can be unintentionally left out of professional networks, informal gatherings, and casual conversations among their collogues. Information about informal rules and organizational culture in the workplace is often communicated though these types of interactions, which puts the worker who is deaf at a professional and personal disadvantage. This could sever their [[job performance]] due to lack of access to information and therefore, reduce their opportunity to form relationships with their co-workers. Additionally, these communication barriers can all affect a deaf person's career development. Since being able to effectively communicate with one's co-workers and other people relevant to one's job is essential to managerial positions, people with hearing loss can often be denied such opportunities.<ref name=\"FOSTER\" />\n\nTo avoid these situations in the workplace, individuals can take full-time or part-time sign language courses. In this way, they can become better able to communicate with the deaf and hard of hearing. Such courses teach the American Sign Language (ASL) language as most North Americans use this particular language to communicate. It is a visual language made up of specific gestures (signs), hand shapes, and facial expressions that contain their own unique grammatical rules and sentence structures<ref>Sign Language Classes for Individuals. (2013, January 1). Retrieved November 5, 2014.</ref> By completing sign language courses, it ensures that deaf individuals feel a part of the workplace and have the ability to communicate with their co-workers and employer in the manner as other hearing employees do.\n\n====Health care====\nNot only can communication barriers between deaf and hearing people affect family relationships, work, and school, but they can also have a very significant effect on a deaf individual's physical and [[Deaf mental health care|mental health care]]. As a result of poor communication between the health care professional and the deaf or hard of hearing patient, many patients report that they are not properly informed about their disease and prognosis.<ref name=\"Medicina\">Medicina Oral, Patolog\u00eda Oral y Cirug\u00eda Bucal. (2007, January 1).

Poor communication in this setting is often the result of health care providers having the misconception that all people who are deaf or hard of hearing have the same type of hearing loss, and require the same type of communication methods. In reality, there are many different types and range of hearing loss, and in order to communicate effectively a health care provider needs to understand that each individual with hearing loss has unique needs. This affects how individuals have been educated to communicate, as some communication methods work better depending on an individual's severity of hearing loss. For example, assuming every deaf or hard of hearing patient knows American Sign Language would be incorrect because there are different types of sign language, each varying in signs and meanings. A patient could have been educated to use cued speech which is entirely different from ASL.<ref name=\"Medicina\" /> Therefore, in order to communicate effectively, a health care provider needs to understand that each individual has unique needs when communicating.\n\nAlthough there are specific laws and rules to govern communication between health care professionals and people who are deaf, they are not always followed due to the health care professional's insufficient knowledge of communication techniques. This lack of knowledge can lead them to make assumptions about communicating with someone who is deaf, which can in turn cause them to use an unsuitable form of communication.\nActs in countries such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) state that all health care providers are required to provide reasonable communication accommodations when caring for patients who are deaf. These accommodations could include qualified sign language interpreters, CDIs, and technology such as Internet interpretation services. A qualified sign language interpreter will enhance communication between a deaf individual and a health care professional by interpreting not only a health professional's verbal communication, but also their non-verbal such as expressions, perceptions, and body language. A Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI) is a sign language interpreter who is also a member of the Deaf community.<ref>Ramstead, A. (2014, January 15). The Role of the Certified Deaf Interpreter. Retrieved November 2, 2014, from {{cite web |url=http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |title=The Role of the Deaf Interpreter |access-date=2014-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141105190523/http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |archive-date=2014-11-05 }}</ref> They accompany a sign language interpreter and are useful for communication with deaf individuals who also have language or cognitive deficits. A CDI will transform what the health care professional communicates into basic, simple language. This method takes much longer, however it can also be more effective than other techniques. Internet interpretation services are convenient and less costly, but can potentially pose significant risks. They involve the use of a sign language interpreter over a video device rather than directly in the room. This can often be an inaccurate form of communication because the interpreter may not be licensed, is often unfamiliar with the patient and their signs, and can lack knowledge of medical terminology.<ref>Schuler, G., Mistler, L., Torrey, K., & Depukat, R. (2013). Bridging Communication Gaps with the Deaf. Nursing, 43(11), 24-30.</ref>\n\nAside from utilizing interpreters, healthcare professionals can improve their communication with deaf or hard of hearing patients by educating themselves on common misconceptions and proper practices depending on the patient's needs. For example, a common misconception is that exaggerating words and speaking loudly will help the patient understand more clearly. However, many individuals with hearing loss depend on lip-reading to identify words. Exaggerated pronunciation and a raised voice can distort the lips, making it even more difficult to understand. Another common mistake health care professionals make are the use of single words rather than full sentences. Although language should be kept simple and short, keeping context is important because certain homophonous words are difficult to distinguish by lip-reading. Health care professionals can further improve their own communication with their patients by eliminating any background noise and positioning themselves in a way where their face is clearly visible to the patient, and suitably lit. The healthcare professional should know how to use body language and facial expressions to properly communicate different feelings.<ref name=\"Medicina\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n===Stem cell transplant and gene therapy===\nA 2005 study achieved successful [[regrowth of cochlea cells]] in guinea pigs.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | title=Gene therapy is first deafness 'cure' | work=NewScientist.com News Service | first=Andy | last=Coghlan | name-list-format = vanc | date=2005-02-14 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914114532/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | archive-date=2008-09-14 }}</ref> However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain.

They discovered further evidence for rate coding of pitch, a system that codes for information for frequencies by the rate that neurons fire in the auditory system, especially for lower frequencies as they are coded by the frequencies that neurons fire from the basilar membrane in a synchronous manner. Their results showed that the subjects could identify different pitches that were proportional to the frequency stimulated by a single electrode. The lower frequencies were detected when the basilar membrane was stimulated, providing even further evidence for rate coding.<ref name=\"Carlson, N.

limit}}\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Deaf videoconference.jpg|thumb|A deaf person using a camera-equipped smartphone to communicate in sign language.]]\n*Hearing loss exists when there is diminished acuity to sounds normally heard.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> The terms hearing impaired or hard of hearing are usually reserved for people who have relative inability to hear sound in the speech frequencies. The severity of a hearing loss is categorized according to the increase in intensity of sound above the usual level necessary before the listener can detect it.\n*Deafness is defined as a degree of loss such that a person is unable to understand speech even in the presence of amplification.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> In profound deafness, even the highest intensity sounds produced by an [[audiometer]] (an instrument used to measure hearing by producing pure tone sounds through a range of frequencies) may not be detected. In total deafness, no sounds at all, regardless of amplification or method of production, are heard.\n*[[Speech perception]] \u2013 Another aspect of hearing involves the perceived clarity of a word rather than the intensity of sound made by the word. In humans, that aspect is usually measured by tests of speech discrimination. These tests measure one's ability to understand speech, not to merely detect sound. There are very rare types of hearing loss which affect speech discrimination alone.  One example is [[auditory neuropathy]], a variety of hearing loss in which the outer hair cells of the cochlea are intact and functioning, but sound information is not faithfully transmitted to the auditory nerve and brain properly.<ref name=\"eBook1\">eBook: ''Current Diagnosis & Treatment in Otolaryngology: Head & Neck Surgery'', Lalwani, Anil K. (Ed.) Chapter 44: Audiologic Testing by Brady M. Klaves, PhD, Jennifer McKee Bold, AuD, Access Medicine</ref>\n\nUse of the terms \"hearing impaired\", \"deaf-mute\", or \"deaf and dumb\" to describe deaf and hard of hearing people is discouraged by many in the deaf community as well as advocacy organizations as they are offensive to many deaf and hard of hearing people.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bennett |first1=ReBecca |title=Time for Change |journal=The Hearing Journal |date=May 2019 |volume=72 |issue=5 |page=16 |doi=10.1097/01.HJ.0000559500.67179.7d }}</ref><ref name=NAD2016>{{cite web| title=Community and Culture - Frequently Asked Questions| url=http://nad.org/issues/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-faq| website=nad.org| publisher=National Association of the Deaf| access-date=27 Jan 2016| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227171131/http://nad.org/issues/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-faq| archive-date=2015-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===Hearing standards===\n\n{{See also| Absolute threshold of hearing| Hearing range}}\n\n{{further| Equal-loudness contour| A-weighting}}\n\nHuman hearing extends in frequency from 20\u201320,000&nbsp;Hz, and in intensity from 0&nbsp;dB to 120&nbsp;dB HL or more. 0&nbsp;dB does not represent absence of sound, but rather the softest sound an average unimpaired human ear can hear; some people can hear down to \u22125 or even \u221210&nbsp;dB.  Sound is generally uncomfortably loud above 90&nbsp;dB and 115&nbsp;dB represents the [[threshold of pain]]. The ear does not hear all frequencies equally well; hearing sensitivity peaks around 3000&nbsp;Hz.  There are many qualities of human hearing besides frequency range and intensity that cannot easily be measured quantitatively. But for many practical purposes, normal hearing is defined by a frequency versus intensity graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity thresholds of hearing at defined frequencies.  Because of the cumulative impact of age and exposure to noise and other acoustic insults, 'typical' hearing may not be normal.<ref>ANSI 7029:2000/BS 6951 Acoustics - Statistical distribution of hearing thresholds as a function of age</ref><ref>ANSI S3.5-1997 Speech Intelligibility Index (SII)</ref>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n*difficulty using the [[telephone]]\n*loss of [[Sound localization|directionality of sound]]\n*difficulty [[Speech perception|understanding speech]], especially of children and women whose voices are of a [[Voice frequency#Fundamental frequency|higher frequency]].\n*difficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise ([[cocktail party effect]])\n*sounds or speech becoming dull, muffled or attenuated\n*need for increased volume on television, radio, music and other audio sources\n\nHearing loss is sensory, but may have accompanying symptoms:\n*pain or pressure in the ears\n*a blocked feeling\n\nThere may also be accompanying secondary symptoms:\n*[[hyperacusis]], heightened sensitivity with accompanying auditory pain to certain intensities and frequencies of sound, sometimes defined as \"[[auditory recruitment]]\"\n*[[tinnitus]], ringing, buzzing, hissing or other sounds in the ear when no external sound is present\n*[[vertigo]] and disequilibrium\n*[[Autophony|tympanophonia]], also known as autophonia, abnormal hearing of one's own voice and respiratory sounds, usually as a result of a patulous (a constantly open) eustachian tube or dehiscent superior semicircular canals\n*disturbances of facial movement (indicating a possible tumour or stroke) or in persons with [[Bell's palsy|Bell's Palsy]]\n\n=== Complications ===\nHearing loss is associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[dementia]].

Estimation of a \"safe\" duration of exposure is possible using an ''exchange rate'' of 3&nbsp;dB. As 3&nbsp;dB represents a doubling of the intensity of sound, duration of exposure must be cut in half to maintain the same energy dose. For workplace noise regulation, the \"safe\" daily exposure amount at 85&nbsp;dB A, known as an [[exposure action value]], is 8 hours, while the \"safe\" exposure at 91&nbsp;dB(A) is only 2 hours.<ref>Occupational Noise Exposure, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 98-126</ref>\nDifferent standards use exposure action values between 80dBA and 90dBA. Note that for some people, sound may be damaging at even lower levels than 85&nbsp;dB A. Exposures to other ototoxins (such as pesticides, some medications including chemotherapy agents, solvents, etc.) can lead to greater susceptibility to noise damage, as well as causing its own damage. This is called a ''synergistic'' interaction.  Since noise damage is cumulative over long periods of time, persons who are exposed to non-workplace noise, like recreational activities or environmental noise, may have compounding damage from all sources.\n\nSome national and international organizations and agencies use an exchange rate of 4&nbsp;dB or 5&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| title=Compliance Guide to MSHA's Occupational Noise Exposure Standard, APPENDIX B \u2013 GLOSSARY OF TERMS| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112204458/http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| archive-date=2013-11-12| access-date=2013-11-12}}</ref> While these exchange rates may indicate a wider zone of comfort or safety, they can significantly underestimate the damage caused by loud noise. For example, at 100&nbsp;dB (nightclub music level), a 3&nbsp;dB exchange rate would limit exposure to 15 minutes; the 5&nbsp;dB exchange rate allows an hour.\n\nMany people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels, or of the level at which sound becomes harmful. Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children's toys, motor vehicles, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, musical instruments, and even hair dryers. Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk. If one is exposed to loud sound (including music) at high levels or for extended durations (85&nbsp;dB A or greater), then hearing loss will occur. Sound intensity (sound energy, or propensity to cause damage to the ears) increases dramatically with proximity according to an inverse square law: halving the distance to the sound quadruples the sound intensity.\n\nIn the US, 12.5% of children aged 6\u201319 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure.<ref name=\"kid\">{{cite web| url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss: Promoting Hearing Health Among Youth| work=CDC Healthy Youth!| publisher=CDC| date=2009-07-01| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221020243/http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| archive-date=2009-12-21}}</ref>  The World Health Organization estimates that half of those between 12 and 35 are at risk from using [[personal audio devices]] that are too loud.<ref name=WHO2015Aud/>\n\nHearing loss due to noise has been described as primarily a condition of modern society.<ref name=Go2007>{{cite journal| last1=Goines| first1=Lisa| last2=Hagler| first2=Louis| name-list-format = vanc | title=Noise Pollution: A Modern Plague| journal=Southern Medical Journal| date=March 2007| volume=100| issue=3| pages=287\u2013294 | citeseerx=10.1.1.504.8717| doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e3180318be5| pmid=17396733}}</ref> In preindustrial times, humans had far less exposure to loud sounds.

From a genetic standpoint, this accounts for the other 70% of cases, and represents the majority of hereditary hearing loss.<ref name=Harvard /> Syndromic cases occur with disorders such as [[Usher syndrome]], [[Stickler syndrome]], [[Waardenburg syndrome]], [[Alport's syndrome]], and [[neurofibromatosis type 2]]. These are diseases that have deafness as one of the symptoms or as a common feature associated with it. Many of the genetic mutations giving rise to syndromic deafness have been identified. In nonsyndromic cases, where deafness is the only finding, it is more difficult to identify the genetic mutation although some have been discovered.\n\n* Gene mapping has identified the genetic locations for several nonsyndromic dominant (DFNA#) and recessive (DFNB#) forms of deafness. The first gene mapped for non-syndromic deafness, DFNA1, involves a splice site mutation in the formin related homolog diaphanous 1 (DIAPH1). A single base change in a large [[Costa Rica]]n family was identified as causative in a rare form of low frequency onset progressive hearing loss with autosomal dominant inheritance exhibiting variable age of onset and complete penetrance by age 30.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lynch ED, Lee MK, Morrow JE, Welcsh PL, Le\u00f3n PE, King MC | title = Nonsyndromic deafness DFNA1 associated with mutation of a human homolog of the Drosophila gene diaphanous | journal = Science | volume = 278 | issue = 5341 | pages = 1315\u20138 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9360932 | doi = 10.1126/science.278.5341.1315 | bibcode = 1997Sci...278.1315L | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d51fd6fc618b2769b79b82df451e5aace6f1f993 }}</ref> The most common type of congenital hearing loss in developed countries is DFNB1, also known as connexin 26 deafness or [[GJB2]]-related deafness.\n* The most common dominant syndromic forms of hearing loss include [[Stickler syndrome]] and [[Waardenburg syndrome]].\n* The most common recessive syndromic forms of hearing loss are [[Pendred syndrome]] and [[Usher syndrome]].\n* The congenital defect [[microtia]], deformed or unformed outer ear, can be associated with partial or complete conductive deafness, depending upon the severity of the deformity and whether the middle ear is also affected.

The test is also useful in older children and adults and is an important measure in diagnosing auditory neuropathy described above.\n\nAuditory brainstem response testing is an electrophysiological test used to test for hearing deficits caused by pathology within the ear, the cochlear nerve and also within the brainstem. This test can be used to identify delay in the conduction of neural impulses due to tumours or inflammation but can also be an objective test of hearing thresholds. Other electrophysiological tests, such as cortical evoked responses, can look at the hearing pathway up to the level of the auditory cortex.\n\n===Scans===\n{{contradictory|date=August 2019}}\nMRI and CT scans can be useful to identify the pathology of many causes of hearing loss. They are only needed in selected cases.{{vague|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Classification===\nHearing loss is categorized by type, severity, and configuration. Furthermore, a hearing loss may exist in only one ear (unilateral) or in both ears (bilateral).  Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent, sudden or progressive.\n\n====Severity====\nThe severity of a hearing loss is ranked according to ranges of nominal thresholds in which a sound must be so it can be detected by an individual. It is measured in [[decibel]]s of hearing loss, or dB HL. The measurement of hearing loss in an individual is conducted over several [[frequency|frequencies]], mostly 500&nbsp;Hz, 1000&nbsp;Hz, 2000&nbsp;Hz and 4000&nbsp;Hz. The hearing loss of the individual is the average of the hearing loss values over the different frequencies. Hearing loss can be ranked differently according to different organisations; and so, in different countries different systems are in use.\n\nHearing loss may be ranked as slight, mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound as defined below:{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n* Slight: between 16 and 25&nbsp;dB HL\n* Mild:\n** for adults: between 26 and 40&nbsp;dB HL\n** for children: between 20 and 40&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Moderate: between 41 and 54&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Moderately severe: between 55 and 70&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Severe: between 71 and 90&nbsp;dB HL<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Profound: 91&nbsp;dB HL or greater<ref name=\"Peads2011\" />\n* Totally deaf: Have no hearing at all.  This is called ''anacusis''.\n\nThe 'Audiometric Classifications of Hearing Impairment' according to the International Bureau Audiophonology (BIAP) in Belgium is as follows:<ref>{{cite web|title=BIAP Recommendation 02/1 bis - AUDIOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF HEARING IMPAIRMENTS|url=https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|website=biap.org|publisher=International Bureau Audiophonology|access-date=18 June 2017|date=26 October 1996|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908010426/https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|archive-date=8 September 2017}}</ref>\n* Normal or subnormal hearing: average tone loss is equal or below 20&nbsp;dB HL\n* Mild hearing loss: average tone loss between 21 and 40&nbsp;dB HL\n* Moderate hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 41 and 55&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 56 and 70&nbsp;dB HL\n* Severe hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 71 and 80&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 81 and 90&nbsp;dB HL\n* Very severe hearing loss\n** First degree: average tone loss between 91 and 100&nbsp;dB HL\n** Second degree: average tone loss between 101 and 110&nbsp;dB HL\n** Third degree: average tone loss between 111 and 119&nbsp;dB HL\n* Total hearing loss or Cophosis: average tone loss is equal or more than 120&nbsp;dB HL\n\nHearing loss may affect one or both ears. If both ears are affected, then one ear may be more affected than the other.  Thus it is possible, for example, to have normal hearing in one ear and none at all in the other, or to have mild hearing loss in one ear and moderate hearing loss in the other.\n\nFor certain legal purposes such as insurance claims, hearing loss is described in terms of percentages. Given that hearing loss can vary by frequency and that audiograms are plotted with a logarithmic scale, the idea of a percentage of hearing loss is somewhat arbitrary, but where decibels of loss are converted via a legally recognized formula, it is possible to calculate a standardized \"percentage of hearing loss\", which is suitable for legal purposes only.\n\n====Type====\nThere are three main types of hearing loss, [[conductive hearing loss]], [[sensorineural hearing loss]]. Combinations of conductive and sensorineural hearing losses are called a mixed hearing loss.<ref name=\"Peads2011\" /> An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is [[auditory processing disorder]] which is not a hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound.\n\n*Conductive hearing loss\nConductive hearing loss is present when the sound is not reaching the inner ear, the [[cochlea]]. This can be due to external ear canal malformation, dysfunction of the eardrum or malfunction of the bones of the middle ear. The eardrum may show defects from small to total resulting in hearing loss of different degree. [[Granulation tissue|Scar tissue]] after ear infections may also make the eardrum dysfunction as well as when it is retracted and adherent to the medial part of the middle ear.\n\nDysfunction of the three small bones of the [[middle ear]] \u2013 malleus, incus, and stapes \u2013 may cause conductive hearing loss. The mobility of the [[ossicles]] may be impaired for different reasons including a boney disorder of the ossicles called [[otosclerosis]] and disruption of the ossicular chain due to trauma, infection or [[ankylosis]] may also cause hearing loss.\n\n*Sensorineural hearing loss\nSensorineural hearing loss is one caused by dysfunction of the inner ear, the cochlea or the nerve that transmits the impulses from the cochlea to the hearing centre in the brain. The most common reason for sensorineural hearing loss is damage to the [[hair cells]] in the cochlea. Depending on the definition it could be estimated that more than 50% of the population over the age of 70 has impaired hearing.<ref name=\"RussellPineYoung2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell JL, Pine HS, Young DL | title = Pediatric cochlear implantation: expanding applications and outcomes | journal = Pediatric Clinics of North America | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 841\u201363 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23905823 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2013.04.008 }}</ref>\n\n*Central deafness\nDamage to the brain can lead to a central deafness. The peripheral ear and the auditory nerve may function well but the central connections are damaged by tumour, trauma or other disease and the patient is unable to process speech information.\n\n*Mixed hearing loss\nMixed hearing loss is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Chronic ear infection (a fairly common diagnosis) can cause a defective [[ear drum]] or middle-ear ossicle damages, or both.  In addition to the conductive loss, a sensory component may be present.\n\n*Central [[auditory processing disorder]]\n\nThis is not an actual hearing loss but gives rise to significant difficulties in hearing. One kind of auditory processing disorder is [[King-Kopetzky syndrome]], which is characterized by an inability to process out background noise in noisy environments despite normal performance on traditional hearing tests. An [[auditory processing disorder]]s is sometimes linked to language disorders in persons of all ages.\n\n====Configuration====\nThe shape of an audiogram shows the relative configuration of the hearing loss, such as a [[Carhart notch]] for otosclerosis, 'noise' notch for noise-induced damage, high frequency rolloff for presbycusis, or a flat audiogram for conductive hearing loss. In conjunction with speech audiometry, it may indicate central auditory processing disorder, or the presence of a [[schwannoma]] or other tumor.\nThere are four general configurations of hearing loss:\n\n1. Flat: thresholds essentially equal across test frequencies.\n\n2. Sloping: lower (better) thresholds in low-frequency regions and higher (poorer) thresholds in high-frequency regions.\n\n3. Rising: higher (poorer) thresholds in low-frequency regions and lower (better) thresholds in higher-frequency regions.\n\n4. Trough-shaped (\"cookie-bite\" or \"U\" shaped): greatest hearing loss in the mid-frequency range, with lower (better) thresholds in low- and high-frequency regions.\n\n====Unilateral and bilateral====\nPeople with [[unilateral hearing loss]] or single-sided deafness (SSD) have difficulty in:\n\n*hearing conversation on their impaired side\n*localizing sound\n*understanding speech in the presence of background noise.\n\nIn quiet conditions, speech discrimination is approximately the same for normal hearing and those with unilateral deafness; however, in noisy environments speech discrimination varies individually and ranges from mild to severe.\n\nOne reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the [[head shadow effect]]. Newborn children with no hearing on one side but one normal ear could still have problems.<ref name=\"pmid15148171\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lieu JE | title = Speech-language and educational consequences of unilateral hearing loss in children | journal = Archives of Otolaryngology\u2013Head & Neck Surgery | volume = 130 | issue = 5 | pages = 524\u201330 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15148171 | doi = 10.1001/archotol.130.5.524 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Speech development could be delayed and difficulties to concentrate in school are common.

For the most part, there is little objection to those who lost their hearing later in life, or culturally deaf adults choosing to be fitted with a cochlear implant.<ref name=Spa2005/>\n\nMany in the deaf community strongly object to a deaf child being fitted with a cochlear implant (often on the advice of an audiologist); new parents may not have sufficient information on raising deaf children and placed in an oral-only program that emphasizes the ability to speak and listen over other forms of communication such as [[sign language]] or [[total communication]]. Many deaf people view cochlear implants and other hearing devices as confusing to one's identity. They feel a deaf person will never be a hearing person and therefore would be trying to fit into a way of living that is not their own. Other concerns include loss of [[deaf culture]] and identity and limitations on hearing restoration.<ref name=Spa2005/>\n\nJack Gannon, a professor at [[Gallaudet University]], said this about [[Deaf culture]]: \"Deaf culture is a set of learned behaviors and perceptions that shape the values and norms of deaf people based on their shared or common experiences.\" Some doctors believe that being deaf makes a person more social. Bill Vicar, from ASL University, shared his experiences as a deaf person, \"[deaf people] tend to congregate around the kitchen table rather than the living room sofa... our good-byes take nearly forever, and our hellos often consist of serious hugs. When two of us meet for the first time we tend to exchange detailed biographies.\"<ref>Deaf Heritage: A Narrative History of Deaf America by Jack Gannon (National Association of the Deaf, 1981)</ref> Deaf culture is not about contemplating what deaf people cannot do and how to fix their problems, an approach known as the \"pathological view of the deaf.\"<ref name=pathological>{{cite web|title=American Deaf Culture|url=http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|work=Sign Media, Incorporated|publisher=Sign Media, Inc|access-date=14 May 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522030209/http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|archive-date=22 May 2013}}</ref> Instead deaf people celebrate what they can do. There is a strong sense of unity between deaf people as they share their experiences of suffering through a similar struggle. This celebration creates a unity between even deaf strangers.

Much of the negative reaction to cochlear implants stems from the medical viewpoint that deafness is a condition that needs to be \"cured,\" while the Deaf community instead regards deafness a defining cultural characteristic.\n\nMany other assistive devices are more acceptable to the Deaf community, including but not limited to, hearing aids, [[closed captioning]], email and the Internet, text telephones, and video relay services.\n\n==Sign language==\n{{Main|Sign language}}\n[[File:Drawing (sign language friend), 2008.jpg|thumb|The sign language for \"friend\".]]\nSign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns.

An argument supporting inclusion, on the other hand, exposes the student to people who are not just like them, preparing them for adult life. Through interacting, children with hearing disabilities can expose themselves to other cultures which in the future may be beneficial for them when it comes to finding jobs and living on their own in a society where their disability may put them in the minority. These are some reasons why a person may or may not want to put their child in an inclusion classroom.<ref name=\"SmithDD2010\" />\n\n====Family====\nThe communication limitations between people who are deaf and their hearing family members can often cause difficulties in family relationships, and affect the strength of relationships among individual family members. It was found that most people who are deaf have hearing parents, which means that the channel that the child and parents communicate through can be very different, often affecting their relationship in a negative way. If a parent communicates best verbally, and their child communicates best using sign language, this could result in ineffective communication between parents and children. Ineffective communication can potentially lead to fights caused by misunderstanding, less willingness to talk about life events and issues, and an overall weaker relationship. Even if individuals in the family made an effort to learn deaf communication techniques such as sign language, a deaf family member often will feel excluded from casual banter; such as the exchange of daily events and news at the dinner table. It is often difficult for people who are deaf to follow these conversations due to the fast-paced and overlapping nature of these exchanges. This can cause a deaf individual to become frustrated and take part in less family conversations. This can potentially result in weaker relationships between the hearing individual and their immediate family members. This communication barrier can have a particularly negative effect on relationships with extended family members as well. Communication between a deaf individual and their extended family members can be very difficult due to the gap in verbal and non-verbal communication. This can cause the individuals to feel frustrated and unwilling to put effort into communicating effectively. The lack of effort put into communicating can result in anger, miscommunication, and unwillingness to build a strong relationship.<ref name=\"FOSTER\">{{cite book | vauthors = Foster S | date = 1996 | chapter = Communication experiences of deaf people: An ethnographic account. | veditors = Parasnis I | title = Cultural and language diversity of the deaf experience | pages = 117\u2013136 | location = New York | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}</ref>\n\n====Community====\n[[File:Alexander Graham Bell and his Scott Circle School.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Graham Bell]] with teachers and students of the Scott Circle School for deaf children, Washington, D.C., 1883]]\nPeople who have hearing loss can often experience many difficulties as a result of communication barriers among them and other hearing individuals in the community. Some major areas that can be impacted by this are involvement in extracurricular activities and social relationships. For young people, extracurricular activities are vehicles for physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development. However, it is often the case that communication barriers between people who are deaf and their hearing peers and coaches/club advisors limit them from getting involved. These communication barriers make it difficult for someone with a hearing loss to understand directions, take advice, collaborate, and form bonding relationships with other team or club members. As a result, extracurricular activities such as sports teams, clubs, and volunteering are often not as enjoyable and beneficial for individuals who have hearing loss, and they may engage in them less often. A lack of community involvement through extracurricular activities may also limit the individual's social network. In general, it can be difficult for someone who is deaf to develop and maintain friendships with their hearing peers due to the communication gap that they experience. They can often miss the jokes, informal banter, and \"messing around\" that is associated with the formation of many friendships among young people. Conversations between people who are deaf and their hearing peers can often be limited and short due to their differences in communication methods and lack of knowledge on how to overcome these differences. Deaf individuals can often experience rejection by hearing peers who are not willing to make an effort to find their way around communication difficulties. Patience and motivation to overcome such communication barriers is required by both the deaf or hard of hearing and hearing individuals in order to establish and maintain good friendships.<ref name=\"FOSTER\" />\n\nMany people tend to forget about the difficulties that deaf children encounter, as they view the deaf child differently from a deaf adult. Deaf children grow up being unable to fully communicate with their parents, siblings and other family members. Examples include being unable to tell their family what they have learned, what they did, asking for help, or even simply being unable to interact in daily conversation. Deaf children have to learn sign language and to read lips at a young age, however they cannot communicate with others using it unless the others are educated in sign language as well. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing are faced with many complications while growing up, for example some children have to wear hearing aids and others require assistance from sign language (ASL) interpreters. The interpreters help them to communicate with other individuals until they develop the skills they need to efficiently communicate on their own. Although growing up for deaf children may entitle more difficulties than for other children, there are many support groups that allow deaf children to interact with other children. This is where they develop friendships. There are also classes for young children to learn sign language in an environment that has other children in their same situation and around their same age. These groups and classes can be very beneficial in providing the child with the proper knowledge and not to mention the societal interactions that they need in order to live a healthy, young, playful and carefree life that any child deserves.\n\nThere are three typical adjustment patterns adopted by adults with hearing loss. The first one is to remain withdrawn into your own self. This provides a sense of safety and familiarity which can be a comforting way to lead your life. The second is to act \"as if\" one does not even have hearing loss. A positive attitude will help people to live a life with no barriers and thus, engage in optimal interaction. The final and third pattern is for the person to accept their hearing loss as a part of them without undervaluing oneself. This means understanding that one is forced to live life with this disability, however it is not the only thing that constitutes life's meaning. Furthermore, many feel as if their inability to hear others during conversation is their fault. It's important that these individuals learn how to become more assertive individuals who do not lack fear when it comes to asking someone to repeat something or to speak a little louder. Although there is much fatigue and frustration that is produced from one's inability to hear, it is important to learn from personal experiences in order to improve on one's communication skills. In essence, these patterns will help adults with hearing loss deal with the communication barriers that are present.<ref name=\"SCHERER\">{{cite book | vauthors = Scherer MJ | date = 2004 | chapter = The Personal Meaning of Hearing or Vision Loss. | title = Connecting To Learn Educational and Assistive Technology for People With Disabilities | pages = 41\u201355 | location = Washington, DC | publisher = American Psychological Association }}</ref>\n\n====Workplace====\nIn most instances, people who are deaf find themselves working with hearing colleagues, where they can often be cut off from the communication going on around them. Interpreters can be provided for meetings and workshops, however are seldom provided for everyday work interactions. Communication of important information needed for jobs typically comes in the form of written or verbal summaries, which do not convey subtle meanings such as tone of voice, side conversations during group discussions, and body language. This can result in confusion and misunderstanding for the worker who is deaf, therefore making it harder to do their job effectively. Additionally, deaf workers can be unintentionally left out of professional networks, informal gatherings, and casual conversations among their collogues. Information about informal rules and organizational culture in the workplace is often communicated though these types of interactions, which puts the worker who is deaf at a professional and personal disadvantage. This could sever their [[job performance]] due to lack of access to information and therefore, reduce their opportunity to form relationships with their co-workers. Additionally, these communication barriers can all affect a deaf person's career development. Since being able to effectively communicate with one's co-workers and other people relevant to one's job is essential to managerial positions, people with hearing loss can often be denied such opportunities.<ref name=\"FOSTER\" />\n\nTo avoid these situations in the workplace, individuals can take full-time or part-time sign language courses. In this way, they can become better able to communicate with the deaf and hard of hearing. Such courses teach the American Sign Language (ASL) language as most North Americans use this particular language to communicate. It is a visual language made up of specific gestures (signs), hand shapes, and facial expressions that contain their own unique grammatical rules and sentence structures<ref>Sign Language Classes for Individuals. (2013, January 1). Retrieved November 5, 2014.</ref> By completing sign language courses, it ensures that deaf individuals feel a part of the workplace and have the ability to communicate with their co-workers and employer in the manner as other hearing employees do.\n\n====Health care====\nNot only can communication barriers between deaf and hearing people affect family relationships, work, and school, but they can also have a very significant effect on a deaf individual's physical and [[Deaf mental health care|mental health care]]. As a result of poor communication between the health care professional and the deaf or hard of hearing patient, many patients report that they are not properly informed about their disease and prognosis.<ref name=\"Medicina\">Medicina Oral, Patolog\u00eda Oral y Cirug\u00eda Bucal.

Poor communication in this setting is often the result of health care providers having the misconception that all people who are deaf or hard of hearing have the same type of hearing loss, and require the same type of communication methods. In reality, there are many different types and range of hearing loss, and in order to communicate effectively a health care provider needs to understand that each individual with hearing loss has unique needs. This affects how individuals have been educated to communicate, as some communication methods work better depending on an individual's severity of hearing loss. For example, assuming every deaf or hard of hearing patient knows American Sign Language would be incorrect because there are different types of sign language, each varying in signs and meanings. A patient could have been educated to use cued speech which is entirely different from ASL.<ref name=\"Medicina\" /> Therefore, in order to communicate effectively, a health care provider needs to understand that each individual has unique needs when communicating.\n\nAlthough there are specific laws and rules to govern communication between health care professionals and people who are deaf, they are not always followed due to the health care professional's insufficient knowledge of communication techniques. This lack of knowledge can lead them to make assumptions about communicating with someone who is deaf, which can in turn cause them to use an unsuitable form of communication.\nActs in countries such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) state that all health care providers are required to provide reasonable communication accommodations when caring for patients who are deaf. These accommodations could include qualified sign language interpreters, CDIs, and technology such as Internet interpretation services. A qualified sign language interpreter will enhance communication between a deaf individual and a health care professional by interpreting not only a health professional's verbal communication, but also their non-verbal such as expressions, perceptions, and body language. A Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI) is a sign language interpreter who is also a member of the Deaf community.<ref>Ramstead, A. (2014, January 15). The Role of the Certified Deaf Interpreter. Retrieved November 2, 2014, from {{cite web |url=http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |title=The Role of the Deaf Interpreter |access-date=2014-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141105190523/http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |archive-date=2014-11-05 }}</ref> They accompany a sign language interpreter and are useful for communication with deaf individuals who also have language or cognitive deficits. A CDI will transform what the health care professional communicates into basic, simple language. This method takes much longer, however it can also be more effective than other techniques. Internet interpretation services are convenient and less costly, but can potentially pose significant risks. They involve the use of a sign language interpreter over a video device rather than directly in the room. This can often be an inaccurate form of communication because the interpreter may not be licensed, is often unfamiliar with the patient and their signs, and can lack knowledge of medical terminology.<ref>Schuler, G., Mistler, L., Torrey, K., & Depukat, R. (2013). Bridging Communication Gaps with the Deaf. Nursing, 43(11), 24-30.</ref>\n\nAside from utilizing interpreters, healthcare professionals can improve their communication with deaf or hard of hearing patients by educating themselves on common misconceptions and proper practices depending on the patient's needs. For example, a common misconception is that exaggerating words and speaking loudly will help the patient understand more clearly. However, many individuals with hearing loss depend on lip-reading to identify words. Exaggerated pronunciation and a raised voice can distort the lips, making it even more difficult to understand. Another common mistake health care professionals make are the use of single words rather than full sentences. Although language should be kept simple and short, keeping context is important because certain homophonous words are difficult to distinguish by lip-reading. Health care professionals can further improve their own communication with their patients by eliminating any background noise and positioning themselves in a way where their face is clearly visible to the patient, and suitably lit. The healthcare professional should know how to use body language and facial expressions to properly communicate different feelings.<ref name=\"Medicina\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n===Stem cell transplant and gene therapy===\nA 2005 study achieved successful [[regrowth of cochlea cells]] in guinea pigs.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | title=Gene therapy is first deafness 'cure' | work=NewScientist.com News Service | first=Andy | last=Coghlan | name-list-format = vanc | date=2005-02-14 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914114532/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | archive-date=2008-09-14 }}</ref> However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain.

They discovered further evidence for rate coding of pitch, a system that codes for information for frequencies by the rate that neurons fire in the auditory system, especially for lower frequencies as they are coded by the frequencies that neurons fire from the basilar membrane in a synchronous manner. Their results showed that the subjects could identify different pitches that were proportional to the frequency stimulated by a single electrode. The lower frequencies were detected when the basilar membrane was stimulated, providing even further evidence for rate coding.<ref name=\"Carlson, N.

Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].  Murray State defeated a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] team coached by [[Digger Phelps]] 56-54.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/sports/murray-state-56-notre-dame-54.html | work=The New York Times | title=Murray State 56 Notre Dame 54 | date=8 December 1981}}</ref>\n\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119-78.

Martin did not make the team but impressed many with his performance.\n\nThe best-known player in the Newton era is [[Popeye Jones]].  While at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''. March 28, 1998. p 3B.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1015130/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Rookie Of The Year | date=22 February 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn Anderson's second year as head coach, the Racers finished the 1999\u20132000 season with a 23-9 record. The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times.

This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament since [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders|Middle Tennessee]] advanced in 1989. The Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].

Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].

Martin did not make the team but impressed many with his performance.\n\nThe best-known player in the Newton era is [[Popeye Jones]].  While at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''.

The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times.

This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament since [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders|Middle Tennessee]] advanced in 1989. The Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].

He was a major [[Calvinist]] opponent of [[John Wesley]].  He is best remembered as the author of the hymn [[Rock of Ages (Christian hymn)|\"Rock of Ages\"]].  Three of his other hymns \u2013 \"A Debtor to Mercy Alone\", \"Deathless Principle, Arise\" and \"Object of My First Desire\" \u2013 are still occasionally sung today.\n\n==Background and early life, 1740\u201355==\nAugustus Toplady was born in [[Farnham]], Surrey, England in November 1740. His father, Richard Toplady, was probably from [[Enniscorthy]], [[County Wexford]] in Ireland.  Richard Toplady became a [[commissioned officer]] in the [[Royal Marines]] in 1739; by the time of his death, he had reached the rank of major.  In May 1741, shortly after Augustus' birth, Richard participated in the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]] (1741), the most significant battle of the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739\u201342), during the course of which he died, most likely of [[yellow fever]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheltering in the Rock |publisher=Banner of Truth |url=http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |accessdate=28 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822223800/http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |archivedate=22 August 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> leaving Augustus' mother to raise the boy alone.\n\nToplady's mother, Catherine, was the daughter of Richard Bate, who was the [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] of [[Chilham]] from 1711 until his death in 1736.  Catherine and her son moved from Farnham to [[Westminster]]. He attended [[Westminster School]] from 1750 to 1755.\n\n==Trinity College, Dublin: 1755\u201360==\nIn 1755, Catherine and Augustus moved to Ireland, and Augustus was enrolled in [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nShortly thereafter, in August 1755, the 15-year-old Toplady attended a sermon preached by James Morris, a follower of [[John Wesley]], in a barn in Codymain, co. Wexford (though in his ''Dying Avowal'', Toplady denies that the preacher was directly connected to Wesley, with whom he had developed a bitter relationship). He would remember this sermon as the time at which he received his [[effectual calling]] from God.\n\nHaving undergone his religious conversion under the preaching of a [[Methodist]], Toplady initially followed Wesley in supporting [[Arminianism]]. In 1758, however, the 18-year-old Toplady read [[Thomas Manton]]'s seventeenth-century sermon on [[Gospel of John|John]]&nbsp;17 and [[Girolamo Zanchi|Jerome Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562). These works convinced Toplady that [[Calvinism]], not Arminianism, was correct.\n\nIn 1759, Toplady published his first book, ''Poems on Sacred Subjects''.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Trinity College in 1760, Toplady and his mother returned to Westminster. There, Toplady met and was influenced by several prominent Calvinist ministers, including [[George Whitefield]], [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]], and [[William Romaine]]. It was John Gill who in 1760 urged Toplady to publish his translation of Zanchius's work on predestination, Toplady commenting that \"I was not then, however, sufficiently delivered from the fear of man.\"<ref>{{Citation | volume = 1 | last = Toplady | title = Works | page = 189}}, at {{Citation | page = 34 | first = T | last = Wrights | year = 1911 | type = biography | title = Toplady}}.</ref>\n\n==Church ministry: 1762\u201378==\nIn 1762, [[Edward Willes (priest)|Edward Willes]], the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]], ordained Toplady as an Anglican [[Anglican ministry#Deacons|deacon]], appointing him [[curate]] of [[Blagdon]], located in the [[Mendip Hills]] of [[Somerset]].\n\nToplady wrote his famous hymn ''Rock of Ages'' in 1763.  A local tradition \u2013 discounted by most historians \u2013 holds that he wrote the hymn after seeking shelter under a large rock at [[Burrington Combe]], a magnificent ravine close to Blagdon, during a [[thunderstorm]].\n\nUpon being ordained [[Anglican ministry#Priests|priest]] in 1764, Toplady returned to London briefly, and then served as curate of [[Farleigh Hungerford]] for a little over a year (1764\u201365). He then returned to stay with friends in London for 1765\u201366.\n\nIn May 1766, he became incumbent of [[Harpford]] and [[Venn Ottery]], two villages in [[Devon]].  In 1768, however, he learned that he had been named to this incumbency because it had been purchased for him; seeing this as [[simony]], he chose to exchange the incumbency for the post of [[Vicar#Anglican|vicar]] of [[Broadhembury]], another Devon village.  He would serve as vicar of Broadhembury until his death, although he received leave to be absent from Broadhembury from 1775 on.\n\nToplady never married, though he did have relationships with two women.  The first was [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], the founder of the [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion]], a Calvinist Methodist series of congregations.  Toplady first met Huntingdon in 1763, and preached in her chapels several times in 1775 during his absence from Broadhembury.  The second was [[Catharine Macaulay]], whom he first met in 1773, and with whom he spent a large amount of time in the years 1773\u201377.\n\n===Animals and Natural World===\nToplady was a prolific essayist and letter correspondent and wrote on a wide range of topics. He was interested in the natural world and in animals. He composed a short work ''Sketch of Natural History, with a few particulars on Birds, Meteors, Sagacity of Brutes, and the solar system'', wherein he set down his observations about the marvels of nature, including the behaviour of birds, and illustrations of wise actions on the part of various animals. Toplady also considered the problem of evil as it relates to the sufferings of animals in ''A Short Essay on Original Sin'', and in a public debate delivered a speech on ''Whether unnecessary cruelty to the brute creation is not criminal?''. In this speech he repudiated brutality towards animals and also affirmed his belief that the Scriptures point to the resurrection of animals.<ref>{{Citation | first = Augustus | last = Toplady | title = The Works | place = London | publisher = J Chidley | year = 1837 | origyear = 1794 | pages = 409\u201316, 443\u201346, 518\u201339}}.</ref> Toplady's position about animal brutality and the resurrection were echoed by his contemporaries [[Joseph Butler]], [[Richard Dean (curate)|Richard Dean]], [[Humphry Primatt]] and [[John Wesley]], and throughout the nineteenth century other Christian writers such as Joseph Hamilton, [[G. H. Pember|George Hawkins Pember]], [[George N. H.

Six students had been expelled from [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]] because of their Calvinist views, which [[Thomas Nowell]] criticised as inconsistent with the views of the Church of England. Toplady then criticised Nowell's position in his book ''The Church of England Vindicated from the Charge of Arminianism'', which argued that Calvinism, not Arminianism, was the position historically held by the Church of England.\n\n1769 also saw Toplady publish his translation of [[Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562), one of the works which had convinced Toplady to become a Calvinist in 1758.  Toplady entitled his translation ''The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted''.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uJEPAAAAIAAJPPA8,M1 | title = The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted | first = Girolamo | last = Zanchi}}, translated by Toplady, with a letter to John Wesley appended.</ref> This work drew a vehement response from John Wesley, thus initiating a protracted pamphlet debate between Toplady and Wesley about whether the Church of England was historically Calvinist or Arminian.  This debate peaked in 1774, when Toplady published his 700-page ''The Historic Proof of the Doctrinal Calvinism of the Church of England'', a massive study which traced the doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] from the period of the [[Early Church]] through to [[William Laud]]. The section about the [[Synod of Dort]] contained a footnote identifying five basic propositions of the Calvinist faith, arguably the first appearance in print of the summary of Calvinism known as the [[five points of Calvinism]].\n\nThe relationship between Toplady and Wesley that had initially been cordial, involving exchanges of letters in Toplady's Arminian days, became increasingly bitter and reached its nadir with the \"Zanchy affair\".<ref>{{Citation | chapter = 8 | first = George | last = Ella | year = 2000 | type = biography | title = A Debtor to Mercy Alone}}.</ref> Wesley took exception to the publication of Toplady's translation of Zanchius's work on predestination in 1769 and published, in turn, an abridgment of that work titled ''The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted'', adding his own comment that \"The sum of all is this: One in twenty (suppose) of mankind are elected; nineteen in twenty are reprobated. The elect shall be saved, do what they will; the reprobate will be damned, do what they can. Reader believe this, or be damned. Witness my hand.\" Toplady viewed the abridgment and comments as a distortion of his and Zanchius's views and was particularly enraged that the authorship of these additions were attributed to him, as though he approved of the content.\n\nToplady published a response in the form of \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\".<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206024136/http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm |date=6 December 2007 }} (26 March 1770).</ref>  Wesley never publicly accepted any wrongdoing on his part and seemingly denied his authorship of the comments contained in his abridgement when, in his 1771 work \"The Consequenses Proved\" that responded to Toplady's letter, he ascribed his additions to Toplady.{{Efn | The abridgement was not included in Wesley's \"Collected Works\" until 1872.}}  Subsequently, Wesley avoided direct correspondence with Toplady, famously stating in a letter of 24 June 1770 that \"I do not fight with chimney-sweepers.

His father, Richard Toplady, was probably from [[Enniscorthy]], [[County Wexford]] in Ireland.  Richard Toplady became a [[commissioned officer]] in the [[Royal Marines]] in 1739; by the time of his death, he had reached the rank of major.  In May 1741, shortly after Augustus' birth, Richard participated in the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]] (1741), the most significant battle of the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739\u201342), during the course of which he died, most likely of [[yellow fever]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheltering in the Rock |publisher=Banner of Truth |url=http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |accessdate=28 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822223800/http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |archivedate=22 August 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> leaving Augustus' mother to raise the boy alone.\n\nToplady's mother, Catherine, was the daughter of Richard Bate, who was the [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] of [[Chilham]] from 1711 until his death in 1736.  Catherine and her son moved from Farnham to [[Westminster]]. He attended [[Westminster School]] from 1750 to 1755.\n\n==Trinity College, Dublin: 1755\u201360==\nIn 1755, Catherine and Augustus moved to Ireland, and Augustus was enrolled in [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nShortly thereafter, in August 1755, the 15-year-old Toplady attended a sermon preached by James Morris, a follower of [[John Wesley]], in a barn in Codymain, co. Wexford (though in his ''Dying Avowal'', Toplady denies that the preacher was directly connected to Wesley, with whom he had developed a bitter relationship). He would remember this sermon as the time at which he received his [[effectual calling]] from God.\n\nHaving undergone his religious conversion under the preaching of a [[Methodist]], Toplady initially followed Wesley in supporting [[Arminianism]]. In 1758, however, the 18-year-old Toplady read [[Thomas Manton]]'s seventeenth-century sermon on [[Gospel of John|John]]&nbsp;17 and [[Girolamo Zanchi|Jerome Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562). These works convinced Toplady that [[Calvinism]], not Arminianism, was correct.\n\nIn 1759, Toplady published his first book, ''Poems on Sacred Subjects''.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Trinity College in 1760, Toplady and his mother returned to Westminster. There, Toplady met and was influenced by several prominent Calvinist ministers, including [[George Whitefield]], [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]], and [[William Romaine]]. It was John Gill who in 1760 urged Toplady to publish his translation of Zanchius's work on predestination, Toplady commenting that \"I was not then, however, sufficiently delivered from the fear of man.\"<ref>{{Citation | volume = 1 | last = Toplady | title = Works | page = 189}}, at {{Citation | page = 34 | first = T | last = Wrights | year = 1911 | type = biography | title = Toplady}}.</ref>\n\n==Church ministry: 1762\u201378==\nIn 1762, [[Edward Willes (priest)|Edward Willes]], the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]], ordained Toplady as an Anglican [[Anglican ministry#Deacons|deacon]], appointing him [[curate]] of [[Blagdon]], located in the [[Mendip Hills]] of [[Somerset]].\n\nToplady wrote his famous hymn ''Rock of Ages'' in 1763.  A local tradition \u2013 discounted by most historians \u2013 holds that he wrote the hymn after seeking shelter under a large rock at [[Burrington Combe]], a magnificent ravine close to Blagdon, during a [[thunderstorm]].\n\nUpon being ordained [[Anglican ministry#Priests|priest]] in 1764, Toplady returned to London briefly, and then served as curate of [[Farleigh Hungerford]] for a little over a year (1764\u201365). He then returned to stay with friends in London for 1765\u201366.\n\nIn May 1766, he became incumbent of [[Harpford]] and [[Venn Ottery]], two villages in [[Devon]].  In 1768, however, he learned that he had been named to this incumbency because it had been purchased for him; seeing this as [[simony]], he chose to exchange the incumbency for the post of [[Vicar#Anglican|vicar]] of [[Broadhembury]], another Devon village.  He would serve as vicar of Broadhembury until his death, although he received leave to be absent from Broadhembury from 1775 on.\n\nToplady never married, though he did have relationships with two women.  The first was [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], the founder of the [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion]], a Calvinist Methodist series of congregations.  Toplady first met Huntingdon in 1763, and preached in her chapels several times in 1775 during his absence from Broadhembury.  The second was [[Catharine Macaulay]], whom he first met in 1773, and with whom he spent a large amount of time in the years 1773\u201377.\n\n===Animals and Natural World===\nToplady was a prolific essayist and letter correspondent and wrote on a wide range of topics. He was interested in the natural world and in animals. He composed a short work ''Sketch of Natural History, with a few particulars on Birds, Meteors, Sagacity of Brutes, and the solar system'', wherein he set down his observations about the marvels of nature, including the behaviour of birds, and illustrations of wise actions on the part of various animals. Toplady also considered the problem of evil as it relates to the sufferings of animals in ''A Short Essay on Original Sin'', and in a public debate delivered a speech on ''Whether unnecessary cruelty to the brute creation is not criminal?''. In this speech he repudiated brutality towards animals and also affirmed his belief that the Scriptures point to the resurrection of animals.<ref>{{Citation | first = Augustus | last = Toplady | title = The Works | place = London | publisher = J Chidley | year = 1837 | origyear = 1794 | pages = 409\u201316, 443\u201346, 518\u201339}}.</ref> Toplady's position about animal brutality and the resurrection were echoed by his contemporaries [[Joseph Butler]], [[Richard Dean (curate)|Richard Dean]], [[Humphry Primatt]] and [[John Wesley]], and throughout the nineteenth century other Christian writers such as Joseph Hamilton, [[G.

The large rafts where also proabaly essential to distribute animals along the Early Jurassic Seas.<ref>Hunter, A. W., Mitchell, E. G., Casenove, D., & Mayers, C. (2019).

It is also scheduled to host [[WrestleMania 37]] in March 2021, [[Super Bowl LVI]] in February 2022 and the [[College Football Playoff National Championship]] in January 2023.

The casino remained open, containing a [[poker]] [[cardroom|card room]]. Most of the complex was demolished in 2014 to make way for new construction with the rest demolished in late 2016 after the new Hollywood Park Casino was opened. The current stadium project was not the first stadium proposed for the site. The site was almost home to an NFL stadium two decades earlier. In May 1995 after the departure of the Rams for [[St. Louis]], the National Football League team owners approved, by a 27-1 vote with two abstentions, a resolution supporting a plan to build a $200 million, privately funded stadium on property owned by Hollywood Park for the [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]].

The casino remained open, containing a [[poker]] [[cardroom|card room]]. Most of the complex was demolished in 2014 to make way for new construction with the rest demolished in late 2016 after the new Hollywood Park Casino was opened. The current stadium project was not the first stadium proposed for the site. The site was almost home to an NFL stadium two decades earlier. In May 1995 after the departure of the Rams for [[St. Louis]], the National Football League team owners approved, by a 27-1 vote with two abstentions, a resolution supporting a plan to build a $200 million, privately funded stadium on property owned by Hollywood Park for the [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]].
