On 30 March [[Auckland Rugby League]] held its fifteenth annual meeting with 200 in attendance. The strong financial position of the league was commented on. It was also decided that if possible the Senior Grade would be split into A and B divisions owing to the increasing number of teams who wished to enter but also the gap in standard between the best teams and the worst.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Most Successful Year/Sound Financial Position/The Election of Officers\n| page =12\n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=18981 \n| date = 1925-03-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250331.2.155\n| accessdate = 2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=17th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1925}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1926 Auckland Rugby League season|1926]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Trophy Winners===\n[[City Rovers]] won the First Grade Championship for the 7th time in just 15 seasons. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the 4th time in the 11 seasons it had been competed for. Ponsonby also won the Stormont Shield after defeating City in the final in its inaugural season.\n\nWhile in the B division [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won the inaugural title and were awarded the Norton Cup. At the end of the season these teams competed for their own knockout trophy which was named the Stallard Cup. It was won by [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] who defeated [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] in the final.\n\nIn the lower grades [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] dominated like they were to come to do for many seasons. They won the 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and both sections of the 6th grade. They were a very powerful club at the junior level and this would ultimately lead to great success at the senior grade level.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland team played in 5 matches with a number of other Auckland B and Auckland C team matches. They played against the New Zealand team twice and the touring Queensland side who they drew with 18 all. The Auckland side claimed the Northern Union Challenege Cup off the holders, South Auckland and they retained it against the same opponents in a later match. In addition the Auckland Provincial team played Queensland but were soundly beaten 54-14.\n\n===Death of Bill Stormont and inauguration of the Stormont Shield===\nOn June 4 [[William Stormont]] (known better as Bill Stormont) died, succumbing to rheumatic heart disease. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths - Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1925-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.5\n| accessdate = 2019-11-10}}</ref> Stormont had played for the [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] senior team from 1920 to 1924 scoring 24 tries and kicking 31 goals.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side.

On 30 March [[Auckland Rugby League]] held its fifteenth annual meeting with 200 in attendance. The strong financial position of the league was commented on. It was also decided that if possible the Senior Grade would be split into A and B divisions owing to the increasing number of teams who wished to enter but also the gap in standard between the best teams and the worst.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Most Successful Year/Sound Financial Position/The Election of Officers\n| page =12\n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=18981 \n| date = 1925-03-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250331.2.155\n| accessdate = 2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=17th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=1925}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1926 Auckland Rugby League season|1926]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Trophy Winners===\n[[City Rovers]] won the First Grade Championship for the 7th time in just 15 seasons. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the 4th time in the 11 seasons it had been competed for. Ponsonby also won the Stormont Shield after defeating City in the final in its inaugural season.\n\nWhile in the B division [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] won the inaugural title and were awarded the Norton Cup. At the end of the season these teams competed for their own knockout trophy which was named the Stallard Cup. It was won by [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]] who defeated [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] in the final.\n\nIn the lower grades [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] dominated like they were to come to do for many seasons. They won the 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and both sections of the 6th grade. They were a very powerful club at the junior level and this would ultimately lead to great success at the senior grade level.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland team played in 5 matches with a number of other Auckland B and Auckland C team matches. They played against the New Zealand team twice and the touring Queensland side who they drew with 18 all. The Auckland side claimed the Northern Union Challenege Cup off the holders, South Auckland and they retained it against the same opponents in a later match. In addition the Auckland Provincial team played Queensland but were soundly beaten 54-14.\n\n===Death of Bill Stormont and inauguration of the Stormont Shield===\nOn June 4 [[William Stormont]] (known better as Bill Stormont) died, succumbing to rheumatic heart disease. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths - Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1925-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.5\n| accessdate = 2019-11-10}}</ref> Stormont had played for the [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] senior team from 1920 to 1924 scoring 24 tries and kicking 31 goals.

He had been ill for quite some time and had not played for Marist since the end of the 1924 season. The funeral was on the Sunday leaving his parents residence in Epsom and progressing to Purewa Cemetery where he was buried. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Deaths-Stormont\n| page = 1\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII, Issue 19037\n| date = 1925-06-06\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250606.2.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-20}}</ref> The match between Marist and [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]] on Saturday was originally postponed but was never played. <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 131\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250605.2.126\n| accessdate = 2020-04-20}}</ref> The matches at [[Carlaw Park]] saw one minutes silence before kickoff.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side.
