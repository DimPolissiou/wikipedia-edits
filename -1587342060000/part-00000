It has become a national symbol and as such is taught (for educational purposes) in the nation's schools. Many families celebrate a traditional \"[[All Saints' Day]]\" associated with the Catholic Church.\n\nOriginally, the Day of the Dead as such was not celebrated in northern Mexico, where it was unknown until the 20th century because its indigenous people had different traditions. The people and the church rejected it as a day related to [[Syncretism|syncretizing]] pagan elements with Catholic Christianity. They held the traditional \"All Saints' Day\" in the same way as other Christians in the world. There was limited [[Mesoamerican]] influence in this region, and relatively few indigenous inhabitants from the regions of Southern Mexico, where the holiday was celebrated. In the early 21st century in northern Mexico, D\u00eda de Muertos is observed because the Mexican government made it a national holiday based on educational policies from the 1960s; it has introduced this holiday as a unifying national tradition based on indigenous traditions.<ref>{{cite book|first=Stacy|last=Lee|title=Mexico and the United States|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|date=2002|isbn=978-0761474029}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diariocultura.mx/2012/11/dia-de-muertos-en-nuevo-leon/|title=D\u00eda de Muertos en Nuevo Le\u00f3n|work=Diario Cultura|first=Eduardo|last=Cazares|date=November 2, 2015|publisher=Diario Cultura.mx|access-date=November 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101013136/http://www.diariocultura.mx/2012/11/dia-de-muertos-en-nuevo-leon/#|archive-date=November 1, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milenio.com/monterrey/velorio-penas-pan_0_182981745.html|title=Hasta en el velorio, las penas con pan son menos|first=Gustavo|last=Mendoza|work=Milenio|access-date=November 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025091235/http://www.milenio.com/monterrey/velorio-penas-pan_0_182981745.html#|archive-date=October 25, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Observance in Mexico==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Mixquic M\u00e1gico 17.jpg|thumb|Woman lighting [[copal]] incense at the cemetery during the \"Alumbrada\" vigil in [[San Andr\u00e9s Mixquic]] ]]\n[[File:Calvario de Metepec.jpg|thumb|250px|Day of the Dead altars in [[Metepec]]]]\nThe Day of the Dead celebrations in [[Mexico]] developed from ancient traditions among its pre-Columbian cultures.

For example, in the town of [[P\u00e1tzcuaro]] on the [[Lago de P\u00e1tzcuaro]] in [[Michoac\u00e1n]], the tradition is very different if the deceased is a child rather than an adult. On November 1 of the year after a child's death, the [[godparents]] set a table in the parents' home with sweets, fruits, ''<span lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">pan de muerto</span>'', a cross, a rosary (used to ask the Virgin Mary to pray for them) and candles. This is meant to celebrate the child's life, in respect and appreciation for the parents. There is also dancing with colorful costumes, often with skull-shaped masks and devil masks in the plaza or garden of the town. At midnight on November 2, the people light candles and ride winged boats called ''mariposas'' (butterflies) to Janitzio, an island in the middle of the lake where there is a cemetery, to honor and celebrate the lives of the dead there.\n\nIn contrast, the town of [[Ocotepec, Cuernavaca, Morelos|Ocotepec]], north of [[Cuernavaca]] in the State of [[Morelos]], opens its doors to visitors in exchange for ''<span lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">veladoras</span>'' (small wax candles) to show respect for the recently deceased. In return the visitors receive [[tamales]] and ''atole''. This is done only by the owners of the house where someone in the household has died in the previous year. Many people of the surrounding areas arrive early to eat for free and enjoy the elaborate altars set up to receive the visitors.\n\nIn some parts of the country (especially the cities, where in recent years other customs have been displaced) children in costumes roam the streets, knocking on people's doors for a ''<span lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">calaverita</span>'', a small gift of candies or money; they also ask passersby for it. This relatively recent custom is similar to that of [[Halloween|Halloween's]] [[trick-or-treating]] in the United States. Another peculiar tradition involving children is La Danza de los Viejitos (the dance of the old men) when boys and young men dressed like grandfathers crouch and jump in an energetic dance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rove.me/to/mexico/dia-de-los-muertos-or-day-of-the-dead|title=D\u00eda de los Muertos or Day of the Dead|access-date=August 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829175333/https://rove.me/to/mexico/dia-de-los-muertos-or-day-of-the-dead#|archive-date=August 29, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Observances outside of Mexico==\n{{See also|Festival of the Dead}}\n\n===Americas===\n====Belize====\nIn [[Belize]], Day of the Dead is practiced by people of the [[Yucatec Maya]] ethnicity.

In [[pre-Columbian]] times indigenous Andeans had a tradition of sharing a day with the bones of their ancestors on the third year after burial. Today families keep only the skulls for such rituals. Traditionally, the skulls of family members are kept at home to watch over the family and protect them during the year. On November 9, the family crowns the skulls with fresh flowers, sometimes also dressing them in various garments, and making offerings of cigarettes, coca leaves, alcohol, and various other items in thanks for the year's protection. The skulls are also sometimes taken to the central cemetery in La Paz for a special Mass and blessing.<ref>{{cite news |last=Guidi |first=Ruxandra |title=Las Natitas |publisher=BBC |date=November 9, 2007 |url=http://www.theworld.org/?q=node/13922&answer=true |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206010457/http://www.theworld.org/?q=node%2F13922&answer=true |archivedate=December 6, 2008 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Fiona | title = Bolivians Honor Skull-Toting Tradition | agency = Associated Press | date = November 8, 2005 | url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/bolivia/skulls.htm | accessdate = December 30, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080218053817/http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/bolivia/skulls.htm# | archive-date = February 18, 2008 | url-status=live | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher = Bolivia Line (May 2005) | title = All Saints day in Bolivia&nbsp;\u2013 \"The skull festival\" | accessdate = December 20, 2007 | url = http://www.bolivialine.com/bolivia/newsletter/Newsletter200511.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081023143422/http://www.bolivialine.com/bolivia/newsletter/Newsletter200511.htm# | archive-date = October 23, 2008 | url-status=dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Brazil====\nThe [[Brazil]]ian public holiday of ''Finados'' (Day of the Dead) is celebrated on November 2. Similar to other Day of the Dead celebrations, people go to cemeteries and churches with flowers and candles and offer prayers. The celebration is intended as a positive honoring of the dead. Memorializing the dead draws from indigenous, African and European Catholic origins.\n\n====Ecuador====\nIn [[Ecuador]] the Day of the Dead is observed to some extent by all parts of society, though it is especially important to the indigenous [[Kichwa]] peoples, who make up an estimated quarter of the population. ''Indigena'' families gather together in the community cemetery with offerings of food for a day-long remembrance of their ancestors and lost loved ones. Ceremonial foods include ''[[colada morada]]'', a spiced fruit porridge that derives its deep purple color from the [[Rubus|Andean blackberry]] and purple maize. This is typically consumed with ''[[wawa de pan]]'', a bread shaped like a swaddled infant, though variations include many pigs\u2014the latter being traditional to the city of [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]]. The bread, which is wheat flour-based today, but was made with [[masa]] in the [[pre-Columbian]] era, can be made savory with cheese inside or sweet with a filling of [[guava paste]]. These traditions have permeated mainstream society, as well, where food establishments add both ''colada morada'' and ''gaugua de pan'' to their menus for the season. Many non-indigenous Ecuadorians visit the graves of the deceased, cleaning and bringing flowers, or preparing the traditional foods, too.<ref>{{cite web |first=Gonzalo |last=Ortiz |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=53407 |title=Diversity in Remembering the Dead |publisher=InterPress Service News Agency |date=October 30, 2010 |accessdate=October 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104043236/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=53407 |archivedate=November 4, 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====Guatemala====\n[[Guatemala]]n celebrations of the Day of the Dead, on November 1, are highlighted by the construction and flying of giant kites.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Betsy |last1=Burlingame |first2=Joshua |last2=Wood |url=http://www.expatexchange.com/lib.cfm?networkID=159&articleID=1793 |title=Visit to cemetery in Guatemala |publisher=Expatexchange.com |accessdate=August 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014090440/http://expatexchange.com/lib.cfm?networkID=159&articleID=1793# |archive-date=October 14, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Guatemalans fly kites in the belief{{dubious|reason=traditions often persist even when the belief is gone|date=August 2019}} that the kites help the spirits find their way back to Earth.

It has become a national symbol and as such is taught (for educational purposes) in the nation's schools. Many families celebrate a traditional \"[[All Saints' Day]]\" associated with the Catholic Church.\n\nOriginally, the Day of the Dead as such was not celebrated in northern Mexico, where it was unknown until the 20th century because its indigenous people had different traditions. The people and the church rejected it as a day related to [[Syncretism|syncretizing]] pagan elements with Catholic Christianity. They held the traditional \"All Saints' Day\" in the same way as other Christians in the world. There was limited [[Mesoamerican]] influence in this region, and relatively few indigenous inhabitants from the regions of Southern Mexico, where the holiday was celebrated. In the early 21st century in northern Mexico, D\u00eda de Muertos is observed because the Mexican government made it a national holiday based on educational policies from the 1960s; it has introduced this holiday as a unifying national tradition based on indigenous traditions.<ref>{{cite book|first=Stacy|last=Lee|title=Mexico and the United States|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|date=2002|isbn=978-0761474029}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diariocultura.mx/2012/11/dia-de-muertos-en-nuevo-leon/|title=D\u00eda de Muertos en Nuevo Le\u00f3n|work=Diario Cultura|first=Eduardo|last=Cazares|date=November 2, 2015|publisher=Diario Cultura.mx|access-date=November 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101013136/http://www.diariocultura.mx/2012/11/dia-de-muertos-en-nuevo-leon/#|archive-date=November 1, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milenio.com/monterrey/velorio-penas-pan_0_182981745.html|title=Hasta en el velorio, las penas con pan son menos|first=Gustavo|last=Mendoza|work=Milenio|access-date=November 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025091235/http://www.milenio.com/monterrey/velorio-penas-pan_0_182981745.html#|archive-date=October 25, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Observance in Mexico==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Mixquic M\u00e1gico 17.jpg|thumb|Woman lighting [[copal]] incense at the cemetery during the \"Alumbrada\" vigil in [[San Andr\u00e9s Mixquic]] ]]\n[[File:Calvario de Metepec.jpg|thumb|250px|Day of the Dead altars in [[Metepec]]]]\nThe Day of the Dead celebrations in [[Mexico]] developed from ancient traditions among its pre-Columbian cultures.

For example, in the town of [[P\u00e1tzcuaro]] on the [[Lago de P\u00e1tzcuaro]] in [[Michoac\u00e1n]], the tradition is very different if the deceased is a child rather than an adult. On November 1 of the year after a child's death, the [[godparents]] set a table in the parents' home with sweets, fruits, ''<span lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">pan de muerto</span>'', a cross, a rosary (used to ask the Virgin Mary to pray for them) and candles. This is meant to celebrate the child's life, in respect and appreciation for the parents. There is also dancing with colorful costumes, often with skull-shaped masks and devil masks in the plaza or garden of the town. At midnight on November 2, the people light candles and ride winged boats called ''mariposas'' (butterflies) to Janitzio, an island in the middle of the lake where there is a cemetery, to honor and celebrate the lives of the dead there.\n\nIn contrast, the town of [[Ocotepec, Cuernavaca, Morelos|Ocotepec]], north of [[Cuernavaca]] in the State of [[Morelos]], opens its doors to visitors in exchange for ''<span lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">veladoras</span>'' (small wax candles) to show respect for the recently deceased. In return the visitors receive [[tamales]] and ''atole''. This is done only by the owners of the house where someone in the household has died in the previous year. Many people of the surrounding areas arrive early to eat for free and enjoy the elaborate altars set up to receive the visitors.\n\nIn some parts of the country (especially the cities, where in recent years other customs have been displaced) children in costumes roam the streets, knocking on people's doors for a ''<span lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">calaverita</span>'', a small gift of candies or money; they also ask passersby for it. This relatively recent custom is similar to that of [[Halloween|Halloween's]] [[trick-or-treating]] in the United States. Another peculiar tradition involving children is La Danza de los Viejitos (the dance of the old men) when boys and young men dressed like grandfathers crouch and jump in an energetic dance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rove.me/to/mexico/dia-de-los-muertos-or-day-of-the-dead|title=D\u00eda de los Muertos or Day of the Dead|access-date=August 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829175333/https://rove.me/to/mexico/dia-de-los-muertos-or-day-of-the-dead#|archive-date=August 29, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Observances outside of Mexico==\n{{See also|Festival of the Dead}}\n\n===Americas===\n====Belize====\nIn [[Belize]], Day of the Dead is practiced by people of the [[Yucatec Maya]] ethnicity.

In [[pre-Columbian]] times indigenous Andeans had a tradition of sharing a day with the bones of their ancestors on the third year after burial. Today families keep only the skulls for such rituals. Traditionally, the skulls of family members are kept at home to watch over the family and protect them during the year. On November 9, the family crowns the skulls with fresh flowers, sometimes also dressing them in various garments, and making offerings of cigarettes, coca leaves, alcohol, and various other items in thanks for the year's protection. The skulls are also sometimes taken to the central cemetery in La Paz for a special Mass and blessing.<ref>{{cite news |last=Guidi |first=Ruxandra |title=Las Natitas |publisher=BBC |date=November 9, 2007 |url=http://www.theworld.org/?q=node/13922&answer=true |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206010457/http://www.theworld.org/?q=node%2F13922&answer=true |archivedate=December 6, 2008 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Fiona | title = Bolivians Honor Skull-Toting Tradition | agency = Associated Press | date = November 8, 2005 | url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/bolivia/skulls.htm | accessdate = December 30, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080218053817/http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/bolivia/skulls.htm# | archive-date = February 18, 2008 | url-status=live | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher = Bolivia Line (May 2005) | title = All Saints day in Bolivia&nbsp;\u2013 \"The skull festival\" | accessdate = December 20, 2007 | url = http://www.bolivialine.com/bolivia/newsletter/Newsletter200511.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081023143422/http://www.bolivialine.com/bolivia/newsletter/Newsletter200511.htm# | archive-date = October 23, 2008 | url-status=dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Brazil====\nThe [[Brazil]]ian public holiday of ''Finados'' (Day of the Dead) is celebrated on November 2. Similar to other Day of the Dead celebrations, people go to cemeteries and churches with flowers and candles and offer prayers. The celebration is intended as a positive honoring of the dead. Memorializing the dead draws from indigenous, African and European Catholic origins.\n\n====Ecuador====\nIn [[Ecuador]] the Day of the Dead is observed to some extent by all parts of society, though it is especially important to the indigenous [[Kichwa]] peoples, who make up an estimated quarter of the population. ''Indigena'' families gather together in the community cemetery with offerings of food for a day-long remembrance of their ancestors and lost loved ones. Ceremonial foods include ''[[colada morada]]'', a spiced fruit porridge that derives its deep purple color from the [[Rubus|Andean blackberry]] and purple maize. This is typically consumed with ''[[wawa de pan]]'', a bread shaped like a swaddled infant, though variations include many pigs\u2014the latter being traditional to the city of [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]]. The bread, which is wheat flour-based today, but was made with [[masa]] in the [[pre-Columbian]] era, can be made savory with cheese inside or sweet with a filling of [[guava paste]]. These traditions have permeated mainstream society, as well, where food establishments add both ''colada morada'' and ''gaugua de pan'' to their menus for the season. Many non-indigenous Ecuadorians visit the graves of the deceased, cleaning and bringing flowers, or preparing the traditional foods, too.<ref>{{cite web |first=Gonzalo |last=Ortiz |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=53407 |title=Diversity in Remembering the Dead |publisher=InterPress Service News Agency |date=October 30, 2010 |accessdate=October 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104043236/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=53407 |archivedate=November 4, 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====Guatemala====\n[[Guatemala]]n celebrations of the Day of the Dead, on November 1, are highlighted by the construction and flying of giant kites.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Betsy |last1=Burlingame |first2=Joshua |last2=Wood |url=http://www.expatexchange.com/lib.cfm?networkID=159&articleID=1793 |title=Visit to cemetery in Guatemala |publisher=Expatexchange.com |accessdate=August 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014090440/http://expatexchange.com/lib.cfm?networkID=159&articleID=1793# |archive-date=October 14, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Guatemalans fly kites in the belief{{dubious|reason=traditions often persist even when the belief is gone|date=August 2019}} that the kites help the spirits find their way back to Earth.

In [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]], [[Thomas Higgins (Irish politician)|Thomas Higgins]] was declared elected for the seat of [[North Galway (UK Parliament constituency)|North Galway]], even though he had died earlier that morning, after polling day. More recently, in 1945 Sir [[Edward Taswell Campbell]] at [[Bromley (UK Parliament constituency)|Bromley]] and [[Leslie Pym]] at [[Monmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouth]] died after polling, but nine days before the declaration of the results. Both were declared elected posthumously, and both had been MPs for a number of years. [[Noel Skelton]] is another example in 1935.\n\nThe shortest non-posthumous service was that of [[Alfred Dobbs]], who was declared elected [[Smethwick (UK Parliament constituency)|MP for Smethwick]] on 26 July 1945 and was killed the following day in a car accident on the way to take his seat.<ref>{{cite book |last=Buchanan |first=Tom |date=1991 |title=The Spanish Civil War and the British Labour Movement |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=98 |isbn=0521393337}}</ref>\n\nThe shortest service for women MPs has been 97 days in the case of [[Jane Dodds]], who was MP for [[Brecon and Radnorshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Brecon and Radnorshire]] from a [[2019 Brecon and Radnorshire by-election|by-election on 1 August 2019]] to dissolution of Parliament on 6 November 2019 prior to [[2019 United Kingdom general election|the following month's general election]]. The previous record was 112 days in the case of both [[Ruth Dalton]], who was MP for [[Bishop Auckland (UK Parliament constituency)|Bishop Auckland]] from a [[1929 Bishop Auckland by-election|by-election on 7 February 1929]] to dissolution of Parliament on 10 May 1929 prior to [[1929 United Kingdom general election|that year's general election]], and [[Margo MacDonald]], who was MP for [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] from a [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election on 8 November 1973]] until the dissolution of Parliament on 8 February 1974 prior to the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|coming general election]].\n\n====Shortest total service since 1900====\nFor a comprehensive list of MPs since 1900 with less than 365 days total service see\n* [[List of United Kingdom MPs with the shortest service]]\n\n===Members who never took their seats===\n* [[John Finucane (Sinn F\u00e9in politician)|John Finucane]] <sup>a</sup>, 2019\u2013\n* [[\u00d3rfhlaith Begley]] <sup>a</sup>, 2018\u2013\n* [[Chris Hazzard]] <sup>a</sup>, 2017\u2013\n* [[Elisha McCallion]] <sup>a</sup>, 2017\u20132019\n* [[Barry McElduff]] <sup>a</sup>, 2017\u20132018\n* [[Mickey Brady]] <sup>a</sup>, 2015\u2013\n* [[Francie Molloy]] <sup>a</sup>, 2013\u2013\n* [[Paul Maskey]] <sup>a</sup>, 2011\u2013\n* [[Michelle Gildernew]] <sup>a</sup>, 2001\u20132015, 2017\u2013\n* [[Pat Doherty]] <sup>a</sup>, 2001\u20132017\n* [[Conor Murphy]]  <sup>a</sup>, 2005\u20132015\n* [[Martin McGuinness]] <sup>a</sup>, 1997\u20132013\n* [[Gerry Adams]] <sup>a</sup>, 1983\u201392, 1997\u20132011\n* [[Owen Carron]] <sup>a</sup>, 1981\u201383\n* [[Bobby Sands]] <sup>bc</sup>, 1981\n* [[Philip Clarke (politician)|Philip Clarke]] <sup>abd</sup>, 1955\n* [[Tom Mitchell (Irish politician)|Tom Mitchell]] <sup>abd</sup>, 1955\n* [[Alfred Dobbs]] <sup>c</sup>, 1945\n* [[Joseph Nicholas Bell|Joseph Bell]] <sup>c</sup>, 1922\n* [[Harry Wrightson]] <sup>c</sup>, 1918\u201319\n* [[Members of the 1st D\u00e1il#Members by constituency|69 Sinn F\u00e9in Members elected at the 1918 general election]] (including 6 first elected in by-elections 1917\u201318) <sup>a</sup>\n* [[James Annand]] <sup>c</sup>, 1906\n* [[Thomas Higgins (Irish politician)|Thomas Higgins]] <sup>e</sup>, 1906\n* [[Henry Francis Compton|Henry Compton]] <sup>f</sup>, 1905\u201306 (shortest serving MP \u2013 46 days \u2013 whose tenure was not ended by his death)\n* [[Joseph Andrews (British politician)|Joseph Andrews]] <sup>f</sup>, 1905\u201306\n\nNotes:\n:<sup>a</sup> Abstentionist\n:<sup>b</sup> In prison at time of election\n:<sup>c</sup> Died before taking seat\n:<sup>d</sup> Ruled ineligible\n:<sup>e</sup> Elected posthumously\n:<sup>f</sup> By-election win was superseded by subsequent general election, without Parliament sitting in the meantime\n\n==MPs who never won an election==\nOn rare occasions the election winner may be disqualified, either by an [[election court]] or by the House of Commons, and the seat awarded to the runner-up.\n:[[Malcolm St. Clair (UK politician)|Malcolm St. Clair]]: Bristol South-East, 1961\u201363\n:[[Charles Beattie]]: Mid-Ulster, 1955\u201356\n\n==MPs elected to two or more constituencies simultaneously==\n* [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]: elected in 1880 General election for three separate seats \u2013 [[Cork City]], [[Mayo (UK Parliament constituency)|Mayo]] and [[Meath (UK Parliament constituency)|Meath]].\n* [[Richard Hazleton]]: from 9 December 1910 until 23 February 1911, when he was unseated on a petition from the second seat, he was MP for [[North Galway (UK Parliament constituency)|North Galway]] and [[North Louth (UK Parliament constituency)|North Louth]].\n* At the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 election]], 4 [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] candidates were each elected to two seats: [[Arthur Griffith]] (Cavan East and Tyrone North West), [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] (Clare East and Mayo East), [[Liam Mellows]] (Galway East and Meath North) and [[Eoin MacNeill]] (Londonderry City and National University of Ireland).

All began serving in the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 126 years.\n* [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Henry Paget, Lord Paget (later 1st Marquess of Anglesey)]] served 1790\u20131804 and 1806\u201310; [[Arthur Paget (diplomat)|Arthur Paget]] 1794\u20131807; [[Berkeley Paget]] 1807\u201326; [[Charles Paget (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Charles Paget]] 1804\u201326 and 1831\u201333 and 1833\u201334; [[Edward Paget|Sir Edward Paget]], 1796\u20131806 and 1810\u201320; and [[William Paget (MP)|William Paget]] 1790 to his death in 1794. Four of the brothers began serving under the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 79 years.\n\n===Longest span of service in the Commons by brothers===\nProbably the longest (though not continuous) all time span of service by brothers in the Commons, in the Parliament of England, was 85 years from 1562, when [[Henry Knollys (privateer)|Sir Henry Knollys]] was elected MP for [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]], until the death in 1648 of his brother [[Francis Knollys (admiral)|Sir Francis Knollys]] (above, aged reputedly 97) also representing Reading, although there were intervals of years when parliament did not meet. They were part of another set of six brothers who all sat at various times.\n\nSince regular parliamentary government was established by the start of the UK Parliament, contenders for longest span of continuous service include the four brothers [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] (also twice Prime Minister), [[William Yates Peel]], [[Jonathan Peel]] and [[Edmund Peel]], with a span of 59 years from Robert's by-election return on 15 April 1809 as MP for [[Cashel (UK Parliament constituency)|Cashel]], to the retirement of Jonathan at the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. Their collective service totalled 115 years and all four were simultaneously in Parliament when Edmund was sitting in 1831\u201332 and 1835\u201337 for [[Newcastle-under-Lyme (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle-under-Lyme]]. Another 59 year service span was enjoyed by two brothers, [[William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale]] (when Viscount Lowther before entering the House of Lords in 1841) and [[Henry Cecil Lowther]], from the former's election as MP for [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth]] in 1808 until the death of the latter as MP for [[Westmorland (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland]] (which he had represented since 1812) and [[Father of the House]] on 4 December 1867.\n\n[[Thomas Hyde Villiers]] and his brother [[Charles Pelham Villiers]] (above) had a span of nearly 72 years service from the former's first election as MP in 1826 to the latter's death as a serving MP and Father of the House in 1898, but this was broken by an interval when the former was out of parliament in 1831, and the gap between Thomas' death on 3 December 1832 and Charles' first election in [[1835 United Kingdom general election|1835]]. Their consecutive service thus totalled 69 years.\n\n===Representation of same constituency by brothers===\nWhere seats were in the patronage of territorial magnates, it was commonplace into the 19th century for brothers in (usually landowning) families to hold seats successively or (before the advent of single member seats) even concurrently, before the system of choosing candidates by local party associations became organised on a competitive selection basis.\nTwo brothers successively represented [[North Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Derbyshire]] for a total span of nearly 48 years.

All began serving in the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 126 years.\n* [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Henry Paget, Lord Paget (later 1st Marquess of Anglesey)]] served 1790\u20131804 and 1806\u201310; [[Arthur Paget (diplomat)|Arthur Paget]] 1794\u20131807; [[Berkeley Paget]] 1807\u201326; [[Charles Paget (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Charles Paget]] 1804\u201326 and 1831\u201333 and 1833\u201334; [[Edward Paget|Sir Edward Paget]], 1796\u20131806 and 1810\u201320; and [[William Paget (MP)|William Paget]] 1790 to his death in 1794. Four of the brothers began serving under the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 79 years.\n\n===Longest span of service in the Commons by brothers===\nProbably the longest (though not continuous) all time span of service by brothers in the Commons, in the Parliament of England, was 85 years from 1562, when [[Henry Knollys (privateer)|Sir Henry Knollys]] was elected MP for [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]], until the death in 1648 of his brother [[Francis Knollys (admiral)|Sir Francis Knollys]] (above, aged reputedly 97) also representing Reading, although there were intervals of years when parliament did not meet. They were part of another set of six brothers who all sat at various times.\n\nSince regular parliamentary government was established by the start of the UK Parliament, contenders for longest span of continuous service include the four brothers [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] (also twice Prime Minister), [[William Yates Peel]], [[Jonathan Peel]] and [[Edmund Peel]], with a span of 59 years from Robert's by-election return on 15 April 1809 as MP for [[Cashel (UK Parliament constituency)|Cashel]], to the retirement of Jonathan at the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. Their collective service totalled 115 years and all four were simultaneously in Parliament when Edmund was sitting in 1831\u201332 and 1835\u201337 for [[Newcastle-under-Lyme (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle-under-Lyme]]. Another 59 year service span was enjoyed by two brothers, [[William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale]] (when Viscount Lowther before entering the House of Lords in 1841) and [[Henry Cecil Lowther]], from the former's election as MP for [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth]] in 1808 until the death of the latter as MP for [[Westmorland (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland]] (which he had represented since 1812) and [[Father of the House]] on 4 December 1867.\n\n[[Thomas Hyde Villiers]] and his brother [[Charles Pelham Villiers]] (above) had a span of nearly 72 years service from the former's first election as MP in 1826 to the latter's death as a serving MP and Father of the House in 1898, but this was broken by an interval when the former was out of parliament in 1831, and the gap between Thomas' death on 3 December 1832 and Charles' first election in [[1835 United Kingdom general election|1835]]. Their consecutive service thus totalled 69 years.\n\n===Representation of same constituency by brothers===\nWhere seats were in the patronage of territorial magnates, it was commonplace into the 19th century for brothers in (usually landowning) families to hold seats successively or (before the advent of single member seats) even concurrently, before the system of choosing candidates by local party associations became organised on a competitive selection basis.\nTwo brothers successively represented [[North Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Derbyshire]] for a total span of nearly 48 years.

The film stars [[Christina Ricci]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], [[Eric Idle]], and [[Amy Brenneman]], and also features the voices of [[Malachi Pearson]] in the [[title role]] as well as Joe Nipote, [[Joe Alaskey]], and [[Brad Garrett]].\n\nThe film makes extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the ghosts, and it is the first feature film to have a fully CGI character in the lead role. It goes for a much darker interpretation of the Friendly Ghost in comparison to the comics, cartoons, and films of the previous years, especially with its theme of death, most notably providing the character a tragic backstory that addresses his death.\n\n''Casper'' was released in cinemas on May 26, 1995 by [[Universal Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and earned $287.9 million<ref name=\"box office\" /> on a $55 million<ref name=\"box office\"/> budget. It went on to spawn [[direct-to-video]] follow-up films and an animated television spin-off, ''[[The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Friendship, Maine]], young boys Nicky and Andreas enter Whipstaff Manor on a dare, but are scared away by a ghost named [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]].\n\nMeanwhile, following the death of her father, neurotic and spoiled heiress Carrigan Crittenden discovers she has only been left Whipstaff Manor in his will while his vast wealth has gone to several charities. Carrigan and her assistant, Dibs, find a map within the will's papers that tell of an alleged treasure hidden inside the manor, but find the property haunted by Casper and his [[poltergeist]] uncles, the [[Ghostly Trio]], and unsuccessfully attempt to force the ghosts out by way of paranormal experts and a demolitions team. A lonely Casper watches a news report about paranormal therapist James Harvey and is instantly smitten with his teenage daughter, Kat, prompting Casper to inspire Carrigan in summoning Dr. Harvey to Whipstaff. Harvey and Kat are estranged due to his reputation and obsession with contacting the ghost of his late wife, Amelia. The Harveys move into Whipstaff, but Casper's attempt to befriend them fails when his uncles try to torment and scare them away, which eventually fails.\n\nCasper gains the Harveys' trust when he serves them breakfast, and follows Kat to school, where she becomes popular when her class learns she is living in Whipstaff, and agrees to host their Halloween party. Her envious classmate Amber plots with her boyfriend, Vic, to humiliate Kat during the party. Harvey attempts therapy sessions with the Ghostly Trio, who not only try to avoid them, but also reveal they know Amelia; in exchange for convincing Carrigan to leave them alone, they promise to go through the \"red tape\" involved to get Harvey a meeting with his wife.\n\nKat learns Casper has no memory of his life, and restores his old playroom to remind him. Casper recognizes an old wooden [[sled]] his father bought him, and remembers playing outside until he caught a severe cold and died of [[pneumonia]], becoming a ghost to keep his father company. A newspaper article reveals that Casper's father was declared legally insane after he built a machine, the Lazarus, which he claimed could bring the dead back to life. Casper and Kat venture to the basement and find the Lazarus. Carrigan and Dibs sneak inside, steal the formula that powers the Lazarus, and plot to use the machine, believing it could grant them immortality. However, they attempt to kill each other to test the theory and retrieve the treasure they think is in the basement's locked vault; Carrigan falls off a cliff to her death, and rises as a ghost.\n\nDr. Harvey becomes despondent after the trio prank him, prompting them to take him out on the town. They plan on killing him to make themselves a quartet, but have a change of heart after a drunken Harvey declares he will tell Carrigan off so they can stay in their home. However, Harvey accidentally falls to his death down a manhole.\n\nIn the laboratory, Carrigan confronts Casper and Kat, stealing what she believes to be the treasure from the vault and launching Dibs out a window when he tries to double-cross her. Casper and Kat trick Carrigan into saying that she has no unfinished business on Earth, causing her to eject herself into the [[afterlife]]. The treasure is revealed to be Casper's prized baseball, signed by [[Duke Snider]]; the so-called map was part of a game Casper played with his father (thus, Carrigan would've been furious to know that she went through all that trouble for nothing). Dr. Harvey, now a ghost, returns with Casper's uncles, and Kat's despair over this prompts Casper to sacrifice his one chance to return to life, restoring her father instead.\n\nThe Halloween party kicks off upstairs, and Amber and Vic's prank is thwarted by the Ghostly Trio, and they flee in terror. A boy dances with Kat revealing it was Casper who had his wish granted by Amelia, now an angel, who meets with Harvey and tells him that she was so content with her family while alive that she has no unfinished business, and encourages him to move on, explaining that the Ghostly Trio kept their promise to find her for Harvey. Amelia departs as the clock chimes ten and, after kissing Kat, Casper transforms back into a ghost, scaring off the guests. Kat is impressed with the party, which Harvey says is not over, cueing the Ghostly Trio to play their nephew's theme for them to dance to.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Malachi Pearson]] as the voice of [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper McFadden]], a lonely ghost, who was originally a 12-year-old boy who died of pneumonia.

The film stars [[Christina Ricci]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], [[Eric Idle]], and [[Amy Brenneman]], and also features the voices of [[Malachi Pearson]] in the [[title role]] as well as Joe Nipote, [[Joe Alaskey]], and [[Brad Garrett]].\n\nThe film makes extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the ghosts, and it is the first feature film to have a fully CGI character in the lead role. It goes for a much darker interpretation of the Friendly Ghost in comparison to the comics, cartoons, and films of the previous years, especially with its theme of death, most notably providing the character a tragic backstory that addresses his death.\n\n''Casper'' was released in cinemas on May 26, 1995 by [[Universal Pictures]]. It received mixed reviews from critics and earned $287.9 million<ref name=\"box office\" /> on a $55 million<ref name=\"box office\"/> budget. It went on to spawn [[direct-to-video]] follow-up films and an animated television spin-off, ''[[The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Friendship, Maine]], young boys Nicky and Andreas enter Whipstaff Manor on a dare, but are scared away by a ghost named [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]].\n\nMeanwhile, following the death of her father, neurotic and spoiled heiress Carrigan Crittenden discovers she has only been left Whipstaff Manor in his will while his vast wealth has gone to several charities. Carrigan and her assistant, Dibs, find a map within the will's papers that tell of an alleged treasure hidden inside the manor, but find the property haunted by Casper and his [[poltergeist]] uncles, the [[Ghostly Trio]], and unsuccessfully attempt to force the ghosts out by way of paranormal experts and a demolitions team. A lonely Casper watches a news report about paranormal therapist James Harvey and is instantly smitten with his teenage daughter, Kat, prompting Casper to inspire Carrigan in summoning Dr. Harvey to Whipstaff. Harvey and Kat are estranged due to his reputation and obsession with contacting the ghost of his late wife, Amelia. The Harveys move into Whipstaff, but Casper's attempt to befriend them fails when his uncles try to torment and scare them away, which eventually fails.\n\nCasper gains the Harveys' trust when he serves them breakfast, and follows Kat to school, where she becomes popular when her class learns she is living in Whipstaff, and agrees to host their Halloween party. Her envious classmate Amber plots with her boyfriend, Vic, to humiliate Kat during the party. Harvey attempts therapy sessions with the Ghostly Trio, who not only try to avoid them, but also reveal they know Amelia; in exchange for convincing Carrigan to leave them alone, they promise to go through the \"red tape\" involved to get Harvey a meeting with his wife.\n\nKat learns Casper has no memory of his life, and restores his old playroom to remind him. Casper recognizes an old wooden [[sled]] his father bought him, and remembers playing outside until he caught a severe cold and died of [[pneumonia]], becoming a ghost to keep his father company. A newspaper article reveals that Casper's father was declared legally insane after he built a machine, the Lazarus, which he claimed could bring the dead back to life. Casper and Kat venture to the basement and find the Lazarus. Carrigan and Dibs sneak inside, steal the formula that powers the Lazarus, and plot to use the machine, believing it could grant them immortality. However, they attempt to kill each other to test the theory and retrieve the treasure they think is in the basement's locked vault; Carrigan falls off a cliff to her death, and rises as a ghost.\n\nDr. Harvey becomes despondent after the trio prank him, prompting them to take him out on the town. They plan on killing him to make themselves a quartet, but have a change of heart after a drunken Harvey declares he will tell Carrigan off so they can stay in their home. However, Harvey accidentally falls to his death down a manhole.\n\nIn the laboratory, Carrigan confronts Casper and Kat, stealing what she believes to be the treasure from the vault and launching Dibs out a window when he tries to double-cross her. Casper and Kat trick Carrigan into saying that she has no unfinished business on Earth, causing her to eject herself into the [[afterlife]]. The treasure is revealed to be Casper's prized baseball, signed by [[Duke Snider]]; the so-called map was part of a game Casper played with his father (thus, Carrigan would've been furious to know that she went through all that trouble for nothing). Dr. Harvey, now a ghost, returns with Casper's uncles, and Kat's despair over this prompts Casper to sacrifice his one chance to return to life, restoring her father instead.\n\nThe Halloween party kicks off upstairs, and Amber and Vic's prank is thwarted by the Ghostly Trio, and they flee in terror. A boy dances with Kat revealing it was Casper who had his wish granted by Amelia, now an angel, who meets with Harvey and tells him that she was so content with her family while alive that she has no unfinished business, and encourages him to move on, explaining that the Ghostly Trio kept their promise to find her for Harvey. Amelia departs as the clock chimes ten and, after kissing Kat, Casper transforms back into a ghost, scaring off the guests. Kat is impressed with the party, which Harvey says is not over, cueing the Ghostly Trio to play their nephew's theme for them to dance to.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Malachi Pearson]] as the voice of [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper McFadden]], a lonely ghost, who was originally a 12-year-old boy who died of pneumonia.

{"title_page": "Ten Mile Road Race", "text_new": "{{short description|Annual road running race held in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada}}\n{{refimprove|date=December 2018}}\nThe '''Fire Fighters Ten Mile Road Race''' is an annual [[road running]] race held in [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].  It originated in 1910, and follows a route linking [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]] and [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]]. The race draws about 700 runners, and is held annually on [[Victoria Day (Canada)|Victoria Day]], a Canadian national holiday. This holiday occurs on the 3rd Monday in May.\n\n== History ==\n \nThe Ten Mile Road Race in Thunder Bay has a history that dates back to 1910. It is the oldest 10 mile road race in Canada, predating the [[Tely 10|Tely 10 mile road race]] held in [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] since 1922. The Fort William Daily Times-Journal, a local newspaper, announced in April 1910 that it would sponsor an annual road race with the purpose of promoting \"healthy and clean sport at the head of the lakes\". The streets were lined with spectators along the entire route. The inaugural race was won by J.E. Edwards of Port Arthur in a time of 57 minutes.\n\nThe Times-Journal went on to provide sponsorship for the race until 1915 when World War I forced the cancellation of the event. It was reinstated in 1920. During the 1930s the race continually drew a great deal of public interest. The number of entrants was consistently higher than in previous years (an average of 30 runners in 1930s vs. an average of 12 runners in the 1920s).\n\n[[World War II]] caused the race to end for 10 years. On Victoria Day 1949, one decade after the last race, the Ten Mile Road race was revived and organized by Branch 6 of the [[Royal Canadian Legion]].  A  mere seven runners toed the line in that race, the lowest turnout ever. In the 1950s the race was not held as interest waned.\n\nIn 1963, Branch 6 revived the Ten Mile Road Race one more time. Competitors and the public demonstrated that there was renewed interest in the race. \nIn 1966 Gary Young entered the ten mile race for the first time, even through he did not finish that first year he has surpassed the saying if you do not first succeed, try, try, try again.\nIn 1967 Gary Young finished his first 10-mile race at the age of 15, placing 10th overall in a time of 67:42. The following year at the age of 16, Gary came 4th overall in a time of 58:53. In 1969 at the age of 17 he won in a time of 56:15. Since then Gary has won more awards in the annual road race than any other runner. In 1976 finishing second overall Gary ran his fastest time in 51:36. Gary has finished second twice and third twice. Gary Young has finished the ten mile race forty eight times plus in 1978 the 10 mile race committee added the Canadian 20 kilometer championship in which Gary finished 3rd overall in a time of 67:24, making 49 times finishing the ten mile route. Gary has finished the ten mile race under one hour thirty-one times. In 2004, Gary Young became the oldest Thunder Bay runner to finish the race under one hour at the age of 52, (3 days short of his 53rd birthday), Gary ran 59:18. Gary now holds the world record for most annual 10 mile races completed. Gary is still competing as of 2016. The world record for most annual road races is 58 held by marathon runner John Kelley (deceased). The world record for most annual races (cross country) completed is 67 by Jack Kirk (deceased). \nIn 1968, the first female competitor ran in the Ten Mile Road Race: Frances Blanche of [[Marathon, Ontario]]. Awards and separate categories for female runners were not initiated until the late 1970s. The fastest time to date for a local female athlete is Sue Kainulainen (58:30 in 1984). She went on to win the women's division seven times. \nIn 1970, the event took on a higher profile as it became the National 10 Mile Championship won by Robert Moore. In 1973 Thunder Bay`s Bill Britten ran the 10 mile in 49:13 while living and training in the city of Thunder Bay. In 1975 Jim Trapp also a native of Thunder Bay came back to Thunder Bay after attending Northern Arizona University and ran in a winning time of 49:04. Bill Britton came 2nd in 1975 in a time of 49:26. In 1978 the 10 mile race committee added a second race,the Canadian 20 Kilometre Championship. This race started before the 10 mile. Bill Britten won in 63:47,Jim Fethers was second in 66:04 and Gary Young placed third in 67:24. Only one woman ran the 20&nbsp;km. race, Marilyn Fraser ran 93:23. Unfortuntely most runners in Thunder Bay raced the 10 mile, and the 20&nbsp;km. race was a big disappointment to the 10 mile road race committee. Since the 1978 race all 10 mile race committees and race directors up to 2016 have failed to recognize the Canadian 20 kilometre event on the Thunder Bay Fire Fighters 10 mile web site. In the 1970s many of the country's top runners traveled to Thunder Bay and provided some of the fastest and most competitive racing the event has ever seen. Some of these runners were Dan Shaughnessy, Brian Armstrong, Robert Moore, and Jerome Drayton (a past winner of Boston Marathon).\n\nThe nature of the race gradually began to expand, from a highly competitive elite event to one encompassing runners of all ability levels. This took place with the beginning of the running boom in the 1970s. Up until this time, the largest number of participants was about 80. Into the 1980s, the numbers of participants increased to 300 or so runners taking on the 10 mile distance. \nIn 1989 [[Lakehead University]] sponsored the race with the help of Branch 6 of the Royal Canadian Legion and other supporters. They continued their sponsorship for the next five years. Bell Canada came on board in 1992 and 1993. The torch was then passed to Shoppers Drug Mart who contributed financial and volunteer support for the next 10 years. In 2004, the 71st running of the 10 Mile Road Race welcomed the Thunder Bay Professional Firefighters Association as the next title sponsor. In 2009, Half Way Motors stepped forward to become a presenting sponsor with the Firefighters continuing as the title sponsors.\n\nIn 1981, a pre-race pasta dinner was added to the venue. It has continued to attract runners, organizers, volunteers along with their families and friends to come together to dine and share stories of past races.\nIn 2009 the race had 714 individual runners and 150 more for relays.\n\n== Course ==\n\nThe current race route is an out and back course and has runners running up and down an overpass bridge twice, making the course more difficult than necessary. Although there have been minor modifications in the course over the years, it continues the tradition of offering a route that connects the two former cities of Fort William and Port Arthur. The course is not a fast course and has never been certified.\n\nThe race starts on Simpson Street near the intersection with Donald Street and follows Simpson Street as it turns into Fort William Road and then into Water Street. At this point the route turns onto Marina Park Drive and the runners experience a clear view from the top of the overpass of Lake Superior and the [[Sleeping Giant (Ontario)|Sleeping Giant]]. The route goes a short distance into Marina Park where it reaches the mid way turning point.  The roads along the course are closed to all vehicular traffic with barricades and volunteers at each intersection. Spectators have easy of access to all sectors of the route with sight lines of the runners on the outward leg and homeward leg of the race.\n\nThe Columbus Centre at the corner of May and Arthur Streets serves as the race centre. It provides the venue for the race registrations, the pre-race pasta dinner, and change rooms and the awards event after the race.\n\nThe race has and continues to be held on the [[Victoria Day (Canada)|Victoria Day]] holiday which occurs on the last Monday on or before May 24. It begins at 9:00 AM to ensure that the runners have a comfortable temperature for the run and the roads can be reopened to traffic before the busier part of the day. \nThe Thunder Bay 10 Mile Road Race celebrated its 75th running in 2008.\n\n==Records==\n\n*Male Open - Pekka P\u00e4iv\u00e4rinta, Finland 47:09 1975\n*Female Open - Erja Ervonen, Finland 57:16 1994\n\nFour Thunder Bay athletes have excelled in this race. Sue Kainulainen has the record for the most victories (7) in the women's division. Jonathon Balabuck has posted 5 consecutive victories in the men's division. Gary Young has the most annual races competed with 48 and has won more awards than any other runner. Bill Britten has run four sub 50 minute ten mile races,1973,1974,1975,1976 and has the highest age graded performance of all Thunder Bay runners at 91.62 percent. In all previous races only one other Thunder Bay runner  has raced under 50 minutes.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\nTimes News Newspaper, Brodie Street Library 1973 tape 360.

It originated in 1910, and follows a route linking [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]] and [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]]. The race draws about 700 runners, and is held annually on [[Victoria Day (Canada)|Victoria Day]], a Canadian national holiday. This holiday occurs on the 3rd Monday in May.\n\n== History ==\n \nThe Ten Mile Road Race in Thunder Bay has a history that dates back to 1910. It is the oldest 10 mile road race in Canada, predating the [[Tely 10|Tely 10 mile road race]] held in [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] since 1922. The Fort William Daily Times-Journal, a local newspaper, announced in April 1910 that it would sponsor an annual road race with the purpose of promoting \"healthy and clean sport at the head of the lakes\". The streets were lined with spectators along the entire route. The inaugural race was won by J.E. Edwards of Port Arthur in a time of 57 minutes.\n\nThe Times-Journal went on to provide sponsorship for the race until 1915 when World War I forced the cancellation of the event. It was reinstated in 1920. During the 1930s the race continually drew a great deal of public interest. The number of entrants was consistently higher than in previous years (an average of 30 runners in 1930s vs. an average of 12 runners in the 1920s).\n\n[[World War II]] caused the race to end for 10 years. On Victoria Day 1949, one decade after the last race, the Ten Mile Road race was revived and organized by Branch 6 of the [[Royal Canadian Legion]].  A  mere seven runners toed the line in that race, the lowest turnout ever. In the 1950s the race was not held as interest waned.\n\nIn 1963, Branch 6 revived the Ten Mile Road Race one more time. Competitors and the public demonstrated that there was renewed interest in the race. \nIn 1966 Gary Young entered the ten mile race for the first time, even through he did not finish that first year he has surpassed the saying if you do not first succeed, try, try, try again.\nIn 1967 Gary Young finished his first 10-mile race at the age of 15, placing 10th overall in a time of 67:42. The following year at the age of 16, Gary came 4th overall in a time of 58:53. In 1969 at the age of 17 he won in a time of 56:15. Since then Gary has won more awards in the annual road race than any other runner. In 1976 finishing second overall Gary ran his fastest time in 51:36. Gary has finished second twice and third twice. Gary Young has finished the ten mile race forty eight times plus in 1978 the 10 mile race committee added the Canadian 20 kilometer championship in which Gary finished 3rd overall in a time of 67:24, making 49 times finishing the ten mile route. Gary has finished the ten mile race under one hour thirty-one times. In 2004, Gary Young became the oldest Thunder Bay runner to finish the race under one hour at the age of 52, (3 days short of his 53rd birthday), Gary ran 59:18. Gary now holds the world record for most annual 10 mile races completed. Gary is still competing as of 2016. The world record for most annual road races is 58 held by marathon runner John Kelley (deceased). The world record for most annual races (cross country) completed is 67 by Jack Kirk (deceased). \nIn 1968, the first female competitor ran in the Ten Mile Road Race: Frances Blanche of [[Marathon, Ontario]].
