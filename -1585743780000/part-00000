A compositor's form is made of wood, strips of bamboo are used to mark the lines and a block is engraved with characters. The block is then cut into squares with a small fine saw till each character forms a separate piece. These separate characters are finished off with a knife on all four sides, and compared and tested till they are exactly the same height and size. Then the types are placed in the columns [of the form] and bamboo strips which have been prepared are pressed in between them. After the types have all been set in the form, the spaces are filled in with wooden plugs, so that the type is perfectly firm and will not move.

In 1541, two different significant publications using wooden movable type were made under the sponsorship of two different princes; the Prince of Shu printing the large literary collection of the earlier Song Dynasty poet Su Che, and the Prince of Yi printing a book written as a rebuttal against superstitions written by a Yuan Dynasty era author.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 1 208 209\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644\u20131911), wooden movable type was used on a much wider scale than even the previous Ming period.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 1 209\"/> It was officially sponsored by the imperial court at Beijing, yet was widespread amongst private printing companies.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 1 209\"/> The creation of movable type writing fonts became a wise enterprise of investment, since they were commonly pawned, sold, or presented as gifts during the Qing period.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 1 209\"/> In the sphere of the imperial court, the official Jin Jian (d. 1794) was placed in charge of printing at the Wuying Palace, where the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] had 253,000 wooden movable type characters crafted in the year of 1733.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 1 209\"/> Jin Jian, the official in charge of this project, provided elaborate detail on the printing process in his ''Wu Ying Tian Ju Zhen Ban Cheng Shi'' (Imperial Printing Office Manual for Movable Type).<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 1 209\"/> In nineteen different sections, he provided detailed description for:\n\n*type body\n*cutting the type\n*making type cases\n*form trays\n*strips in variable thickness\n*blanks\n*center columns\n*sorting trays\n*page and column rule forms\n*setting the text\n*proofing\n*printing\n*distribution of the type\n*and a schedule for rotation<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 1 209\"/>\n\nThere are notable differences between Wang's movable type process and Jin Jian's.

His book listed and described an enormous catalogue of agricultural tools and implements used in the past and in his own day.<ref name=\"needham volume 6 part 2 75\">Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 75.</ref> Furthermore, Wang incorporated a systematic usage of illustrated pictures in his book to accompany every piece of farming equipment described.<ref name=\"needham volume 6 part 2 92\">Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 92.</ref> Wang also created an agricultural [[calendar|calendrical]] diagram in the form of a circle, which included the [[Heavenly Stems]], the [[Earthly Branches]], the four seasons, twelve months, twenty-four solar terms, seventy-two five-day periods, with each sequence of agricultural tasks and the natural phenomena which signal for their necessity, stellar configurations, phenology, and the sequence of agricultural production.<ref name=\"needham volume 6 part 2 53 55\">Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 53-55.</ref>\n\nAmongst the various contemporary agricultural practices mentioned in the Nong Shu, Wang listed and described the use of ploughing, sowing, irrigation, [[Sericulture|cultivation of mulberries]], etc.<ref name=\"needham volume 6 part 2 60\"/> It listed and described many of the various foodstuffs and products of the many regions of China.<ref name=\"needham volume 6 part 2 60\"/> The book outlined the use of not only agricultural tools, but food-processing, irrigation equipment, different types of fields, ceremonial vessels, various types of grain storage, carts, boats, mechanical devices, and textile machinery used in many applications.<ref name=\"needham volume 6 part 2 60\"/>  For example, one of the many devices described and illustrated in drawing is a large [[milling machine|mechanical milling plant]] operated by the motive power of [[ox]]en, with an enormous rotating geared wheel engaging the toothed gears of eight different mills surrounding it.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 195 196\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 195-196.</ref> Of great interest to [[sinologist]] historians, Wang also outlined the difference between the agricultural technology of Northern China and that of Southern China.<ref name=\"needham volume 6 part 2 61\"/> The main characteristic of agricultural technology of the north was technical applications fit for predominantly dryland cultivation, while intensified irrigation cultivation was more suitable for southern China.<ref name=\"needham volume 6 part 2 61\"/> Furthermore, Wang used his treatise as a means to spread knowledge in support of certain agricultural practices or technologies found exclusively in either South or North that could benefit the other, if only they were more widely known, such as the southern hand-[[harrow (tool)|harrow]] used for weeding in the south, yet virtually unknown in the north.<ref name=\"needham volume 6 part 2 61 62\">Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 61-62.</ref>\n\n====''Nong Shu'' chapters====\n\nChapters 1\u20136<ref name=\"needham volume 6 part 2 61\">Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 61.</ref>\n*Comprehensive prescriptions for agriculture and sericulture\n\nChapters 7\u201310<ref name=\"needham volume 6 part 2 61\"/>\n*Treatise on the Hundred Grains\n**Cereals (including legumes, hemp, and sesame)\n**Cucurbits and green vegetables\n**Fruits\n**Bamboos and miscellaneous (including ramie, cotton, tea, dye plants, etc.)\n\nChapters 11\u201322<ref name=\"needham volume 6 part 2 61\"/>\n*Illustrated Treatise on Agricultural Implements\n**Field systems\n**Agricultural tools\n**Wicker and basket ware\n**Food-processing equipment and grain storage\n**Ceremonial vessels, transport\n**Irrigation equipment, water-powered mills, etc.\n**Special implements for wheat\n**Sericulture and textile production\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of typography in East Asia]]\n*[[Woodblock printing]]\n*[[Hua Sui]]\n*[[History of western typography]]\n*[[Printing Press]]\n*[[Johannes Gutenberg]]\n*[[Xu Guangqi]]\n*[[History of Agriculture]]\n*[[Agriculture in China]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Needham, Joseph (1986).

[[District (Taiwan)|district]] on the rocky seacoast in northeastern [[New Taipei City]] in northern [[Taiwan]]. Wanli is a popular tourist destination and the site of the Cape Yeliu [[Miocene]] Formation which features distinctive [[Hoodoo (geology)|hoodoo]] outcrops. The \"Queen's Head\" outcrop is a Taiwanese icon and serves as an informal trademark for the township. Kataw in the adjacent [[Jinshan District, New Taipei|Jinshan District]] features the Wanli [[Taiwanese hot springs]] area, which is connected with the Jinshan Hot Springs (\u91d1\u5c71\u6eab\u6cc9).\n\n==History==\nThe village of '''Masu''' (\u746a\u92c9) was inhabited by [[Taiwanese aborigines]] before the era of European colonization. The area first came under the control of the [[Spanish Formosa|Spanish]], who were then ousted by the [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch]]. The area began to develop when [[Hoklo people]] came to set up fishing operations.\n\nThe [[Ming dynasty]] loyalist [[Koxinga]] landed his troops at Wanli in 1661 to expel the Dutch from their northern strongholds while their [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|principal fortress]] in [[Tainan]] was under siege.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wanli.tpc.gov.tw/_file/1918/SG/39025/D.html|title=\u6b77\u53f2\u6cbf\u9769 (Historical development)|publisher=Wanli District Government|language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nIn 1683, following the [[Qing dynasty]] conquest of Taiwan, the area was incorporated into [[Zhuluo County]].<ref name=\"history\"/> In 1875, it was a member of Kimpauli (\u91d1\u5305\u91cc\u5821), Kelung Sub-Subprefecture (\u57fa\u9686\u652f\u5ef3).\n\nIn 1891, during [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing dynasty rule]], the village was destroyed by military force as punishment for engaging in raids against Chinese camphor men and soldiers near Tokoham (modern-day [[Daxi District|Daxi]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=James W. |authorlink=James W.

In 1901, a reorganisation split ''Taihoku Ken'' up into smaller prefectures, with Banri becoming part of Kinpori (Kimpauli) Subprefecture, {{nihongo|K\u012brun Prefecture|\u57fa\u9686\u5ef3}}.<ref name=\"history\"/> In 1909, K\u012brun Prefecture was amalgamated into the larger {{nihongo|Taihoku Prefecture|\u81fa\u5317\u5ef3}}. This situation remained in place until the [[China]] took over administration of Taiwan at the end of [[World War II]]: Taihoku Prefecture became [[Taipei County]], and Banri Village became Wanli Township.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nWanli is bordered to the northwest by [[Jinshan District]], to the northeast by the [[Pacific Ocean]], to the east by the [[Anle District, Keelung|Anle]] and [[Qidu District]]s of [[Keelung]]. To the south is a short border with [[Xizhi District]] of [[New Taipei City]], and to the southwest is [[Taipei City]]'s [[Shilin District]]. The topography of the area is marked by the rocky Pacific coastline and the forested, mountainous interior.\n\n==Administration==\nSince 25 December 2010 Wanli has been administered as the Wanli District of [[New Taipei City]]. Prior to this date it had been the Wanli Township of Taipei County. Wanli is further subdivided into ten villages; Wanli ({{linktext|lang=zh-tw|\u842c\u91cc|\u91cc}}), Beiji ({{linktext|lang=zh-tw|\u5317\u57fa|\u91cc}}), Guihou ({{linktext|lang=zh-tw|\u9f9c\u543c|\u91cc}}), [[Yehliu]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-tw|\u91ce\u67f3|\u91cc}}), Dapeng ({{linktext|lang=zh-tw|\u5927\u9d6c|\u91cc}}), Huangtan ({{linktext|lang=zh-tw|\u78fa\u6f6d|\u91cc}}), Shuangxing ({{linktext|lang=zh-tw|\u96d9\u8208|\u91cc}}), Xidi ({{linktext|lang=zh-tw|\u6eaa\u5e95|\u91cc}}), Kanjiao ({{linktext|lang=zh-tw|\u5d01\u8173|\u91cc}}), and Zhongfu ({{linktext|lang=zh-tw|\u4e2d\u5e45|\u91cc}}).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Wanli District Government|url=http://www.wanli.tpc.gov.tw/_file/1918/SG/39029/D.html|title=\u91cc\u9577\u901a\u8a0a\u9304 (Village Leader Contact List)|language=Chinese}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.wanli.ntpc.gov.tw/content/?parent_id=10030&type_id=10006|script-title=zh:\u842c\u91cc\u5340\u5168\u5716|website=\u842c\u91cc\u5340\u516c\u6240|quote=\u5927\u9d6c\u91cc \u78fa\u6f6d\u91cc \u91ce\u67f3\u91cc \u9f9c\u543c\u91cc \u5317\u57fa\u91cc \u96d9\u8208\u91cc \u842c\u91cc\u91cc \u4e2d\u5e45\u91cc \u5d01\u8173\u91cc \u6eaa\u5e95\u91cc|language=zh-tw|accessdate=28 June 2019|date=5 November 2018}}</ref> Prior to the 2010 reorganisation Wanli elected its own mayor, but now as a district of New Taipei City the District Chief is appointed by the mayor of New Taipei City.\n\n==Economy==\nThe crabbing industry is important, and in 2012 the government established the [[Wanli Crab]] brand name to boost sales.<ref name=\"Taiwan Panorama Magazine\">{{cite web|last1=Chang|first1=Chiung-fang|title=Wanli Crabs Make a Splash|url=http://www.taiwan-panorama.com/en/show_issue.php?id=2013110211095E.TXT&table=2&h1=RWNvbG9neSBhbmQgRW52aXJvbm1lbnQ%3D&h2=QWdyaWN1bHR1cmU%3D|website=taiwan-panorama.com|publisher=Taiwan Panorama|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n* [[Kuosheng Nuclear Power Plant]]\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n[[File:Taiwan wanli queenshead altonthompson.jpg|right|thumb|The Queen's Head (\u5973\u738b\u982d)]]\n* [[Yehliu]]\n* [[Yehliu Ocean World]]\n* Feicui Bay (\u7fe1\u7fe0\u7063)\n* Wanli UFO village, a large collection of prefabricated [[Futuro]] and [[Venturo]] homes\n\n==Notable natives==\n* [[Huang Yee-ling]], singer\n* [[William Lai]], [[Premier of the Republic of China]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Wanli District, New Taipei}}\n* [[New Taipei]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Wikivoyage|Wanli}}\n{{Districts in Taiwan}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[Category:Districts of New Taipei]]\n", "name_user": "Rich Farmbrough", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:Update date format tag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanli_District,_New_Taipei"}

Sexual relations between persons of the same gender (variously described as \"sodomy\", \"buggery\" or \"sins of carnal nature\") was illegal for most of the history of New York from its days as a Dutch colony through its colonization and independence from British rule as a state in the Union, until such relations were legalized by judicial action in 1981. Activism for the rights of LGBT people in the state began with the rise of protest actions by the first \"[[homophile]]\" organizations in the 1950s and 1960s, although LGBT activism was propelled into a watershed moment in the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]] and the later protests against the apathy of civil and political institutions to the AIDS/HIV crisis. Various organizations were established for LGBT people to advocate for rights and provide human services, the impact of which was increasingly felt at state level.\n\nThe most recent culminations of LGBT rights in New York include the passage of the [[Marriage Equality Act (New York)|Marriage Equality Act]] in June 2011, granting the legalization of [[same-sex marriage in New York|same-sex marriage]] to New York residents, and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the New York-originated landmark case ''United States v. Windsor'' to strike down key federal prohibitions against the recognition of lawful same-sex marriages throughout the United States.\n\nAs of 2017, plans were advancing by the State of New York to host the largest international [[New York City Pride March|LGBT pride celebration]] in 2019, known as [[Stonewall 50 \u2013 WorldPride NYC 2019]], to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.<ref name=\"governor1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-commemoration-50th-anniversary-stonewall-rebellion-2019|title=Governor Cuomo Announces Commemoration of 50th Anniversary of Stonewall Rebellion in 2019|publisher=State of New York|date=June 25, 2017|accessdate=February 3, 2019}}</ref> In New York City, the Stonewall 50 - WorldPride NYC 2019 events produced by [[Heritage of Pride]] will be enhanced through a partnership made with the [[I Love New York|I LOVE NY]] program's LGBT division and shall include a welcome center during the weeks surrounding the Stonewall 50 / WorldPride events that is open to all.

The [[New Netherland]] colony did not retain Dutch criminal law, but the [[Dutch West India Company|West India Company]], which was given legislative powers, gave the rulers of the colony powers to punish capital offenses, which may have included sodomy due to recorded punishments for the crime.\n\nIn 1646, the first sodomy trial in the territory of New Netherland convicted [[Jan Creoli]] on a second offense of sodomy and sentenced him to death by strangulation; his body was then \"burned to ashes\". A second accused, [[Nicolas Hillebrant]] (or Hillebrantsen), was scheduled for a trial in 1658, but no further records indicate progress in the trial or an outcome; a third conviction in 1660, that of [[Jan Quisthout van der Linde]] (or Linden), who was accused of having had sex with his male servant, resulted in his being tied in a sack and dunked into a river to drown, while the servant was flogged.<ref>Shorto, Russell, ''The Island at the Center of the World: The Epic Story of Dutch Manhattan and the Forgotten Colony that Shaped America'' {{ISBN|0-385-50349-0}} (New York, Doubleday, 2004). [http://www.randomhouse.com/features/island/]</ref>\n\nThis status quo of the death penalty for sodomy would remain unchanged after New Netherland was taken by the [[Duke of York]] in 1664, and \"[[buggery]]\" was retained as a capital offense. However, a portion of modern New York fell from 1674 to 1702 within the northern portion of Quaker-ruled [[West Jersey]], whose criminal code was silent on sodomy.\n\nIn 1796, the state's punishment for sodomy was reduced from death to a maximum of 14 years at either solitude or hard labor.\n\n==19th century==\nNew York, as America's largest city, almost doubled population during the first half of the 19th century (from 1800 to 1820 and again by 1840 to 300 000). The city saw the beginnings of a homosexual subculture concomitantly growing with the population.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall. Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152. 2003.</ref>\n\n===Sodomy laws===\nNew York's sodomy laws remained in flux, when an 1801 law raised the punishment to compulsory life imprisonment, with hard labor or solitary confinement as additional attachments; the law was reduced in 1828 to a maximum of 10 years and an expunging of the hard labor and solitude options. The law was again changed in 1881, with sodomy now limited to a maximum of 5\u201320 years. A revision in 1892 eliminated the 5-year minimum.\n\nThe first reported sodomy case in the state's history, ''Lambertson v. People'' (1861), resulted in a conviction for buggery. An 1898 case was prosecuted by the [[New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]], involving a man to allegedly assist another teenage boy to engage in sodomy with another teenage minor. [[Young Griffo]], an Australian featherweight champion boxer, was accused in 1895 for \"Oscar Wildeism\" with a boy; he pleaded \"not guilty\" to the accusation, but no further information exists regarding the outcome of the trial.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Columbus Press-Post|date=May 25, 1895|page=Page 1}}</ref>\n\n===Poetic descriptions===\nContinuing the theme of loving male friendship, the American poet, [[Walt Whitman]] arrived in New York in 1841.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He is widely believed to have been bisexual or gay, and was immediately drawn to young working class men found in certain parks, public baths, the docks, and some bars and dance halls.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He kept records of the men and boys, usually noting age, physical characteristics, job, and origins.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Dispersed in his praise of the city are moments of male admiration, such as in ''Calamus''\u2014 \u201cfrequent and swift flash of eyes offering me robust, athletic love\u201d or in poem Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, where he writes:\n\n\"Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me / approaching or passing, / Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as / I sat, / Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a / word, / Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, / Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, / The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, / Or as small as we like, or both great and small.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nSometimes Whitman's writing verged on explicit, such as in his poem, Native Moments\u2014 \u201cI share the midnight orgies of young men / I pick out some low person for my dearest friend. He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate.\u201d<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Poems like these and Calamus (inspired by Whitman's treasured friends and possible lover, Fred Vaughan who lived with the Whitman family in the 1850s) and the general theme of manly love, functioned as a pseudonym for homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  The developing sub-community had a coded voice to draw more gay and bisexual men to New York and other growing American urban centers. Whitman did, however, in 1890 denounce any sexuality in the comradeship of his works and historians still debate whether he was a practicing homosexual, bisexual, etc.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> But this denouncement shows that homosexuality had become a public question by the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nTwenty years after Whitman came to New York, [[Horatio Alger]] continued the theme of manly love in his stories of the young Victorian [[self-made man]].<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  He came to New York fleeing from a public scandal with a young man in Cape Cod that forced him to leave the ministry, in 1866.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\n===Other developments===\nIn 1888, the [[Everard Baths]], a [[Turkish bath]], was opened, and would gain a growth in reputation among homosexual men.\n\nIn 1895 a group of self-described androgynes in New York organized a club called the [[Cercle Hermaphroditos]], based on their wish \"to unite for defense against the world's bitter persecution\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Pareene |first=Alex |url=http://www.salon.com/2007/10/11/transgender_2/ |title=Why the T in LGBT is here to stay - LGBT |publisher=Salon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref> The group included Jennie June (born in 1874 as [[Earl Lind]]), who described herself as a \"fairie\" or \"androgyne\", which to her meant an individual, as she said, \"with male genitals\", but whose \"psychical constitution\" and sexual life \"approach the female type\".<ref name=\"outhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.outhistory.org/wiki/Earl_Lind_(Ralph_Werther-Jennie_June):_The_Riddle_of_the_Underworld,_1921 |title=Earl Lind (Ralph Werther-Jennie June): The Riddle of the Underworld, 1921 |publisher=OutHistory |accessdate=2012-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729040021/http://www.outhistory.org/wiki/Earl_Lind_%28Ralph_Werther-Jennie_June%29%3A_The_Riddle_of_the_Underworld%2C_1921 |archivedate=2012-07-29 }}</ref>\n\n==20th century==\n\n===1900\u20131949===\n\n====Bathhouses in the early 1900s====\nOn February 21, 1903, [[New York City Police|New York police]] conducted the first recorded [[Vice squad|vice raid]] on a [[gay bathhouse]], the [[Ariston Bathhouse raid|''Ariston Hotel Baths'']]. 26 men were arrested and 12 brought to trial on sodomy charges; 7 men received sentences ranging from 4 to 20 years in prison.<ref name=Chauncey>{{harv|Chauncey|1995}}</ref>\n\nThe Everard Baths was patronized largely by homosexuals by the 1920s and became the community's preeminent social venue from the 1930s onward.<ref name=Stein2004>{{harv|Stein|2004|p=90}}</ref> It was patronized by gay men before the 1920s and by the 1930s had a reputation as ''\"classiest, safest, and best known of the baths,\"'' eventually picking up the nickname, ''Everhard''.<ref name=neilmiller>{{harv|Miller|1995|p=143}}</ref>  On January 5, 1919 the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]] encouraged a police raid on the Everard Baths in which the manager and nine customers were arrested for lewd behavior.

P. Dutton]] in New York. It was the first post-World War II novel whose openly gay and well-adjusted protagonist is not killed off at the end of the story for defying social norms. It is also recognized as one of the \"definitive war-influenced gay novels\", being one of the few books of its period dealing directly with male homosexuality. The book's publication caused a major literary scandal, with the ''[[New York Times]]'' refusing to publish it and Vidal's books being blacklisted from most major critical publications for the next six years, forcing Vidal to write and publish under pseudonyms until his reputation recovered.\n\n===1950\u20131969===\nIn 1950, New York made legal history when it became the first state in the Union to reduce sodomy to a misdemeanor, with a maximum penalty of six months in prison. Nevertheless, anti-LGBT policies continued unabated, and residents in the [[gay village]]s of New York City began to increasingly become disenchanted with silent acceptance of police raids. The New York chapter of the [[Mattachine Society]] was established in 1955 (incorporated in 1961), and [[Barbara Gittings]] established the New York chapter of the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] September 20, 1958.\n\nThe election of Mayor [[John Lindsay]] in 1965 signaled a major shift in city politics, and a new attitude toward sexual mores began changing the social atmosphere of New York. On April 21, 1966, [[Dick Leitsch]], president of the New York [[Mattachine Society]] and two other members staged the Sip-in at the [[Julius (New York City)|Julius]] bar on West 10th Street in Greenwich Village. This resulted in the [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] accommodation rules of the [[New York State Liquor Authority|NY State Liquor Authority]] being overturned in subsequent court actions. These SLA provisions declared that it was illegal for homosexuals to congregate and be served alcoholic beverages in bars. An example of when these laws had been upheld is in 1940 when Gloria's, a bar that had been closed for such violations, fought the case in court and lost. Prior to this change in the law, the business of running a gay bar had to involve paying bribes to the police and Mafia. As soon as the law was altered, the SLA ceased closing legally licensed gay bars and such bars could no longer be prosecuted for serving gays and lesbians. Mattachine pressed this advantage very quickly and Mayor Lindsay was confronted with the issue of police entrapment in gay bars, resulting in this practice being stopped. On the heels of this victory, the mayor cooperated in getting questions about homosexuality removed from NYC hiring practices. The police and fire departments resisted the new policy, however, and refused to cooperate. The result of these changes in the law, combined with the open social- and sexual-attitudes of the late Sixties, led to the increased visibility of gay life in New York. Several licensed gay bars were in operation in [[Greenwich Village]] and the [[Upper West Side]], as well as illegal, unlicensed places serving alcohol, such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] and the Snakepit, both in Greenwich Village. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of violent conflicts between gay men, drag queens and lesbians against a police officer raid in New York City. The first night of rioting began on Friday, June 28, 1969 at about 1:20&nbsp;am, when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar operating without a state license in Greenwich Village. ''Stonewall'' is considered a turning point for the modern [[gay rights]] movement worldwide. Newspaper coverage of the events was minor in the city, since, in the Sixties, huge marches and mass rioting had become commonplace and the Stonewall disturbances were relatively small.\n\nIt was also after 1959 that former male model [[John B. Whyte]] bought the Pines Hotel (renamed the [[Fire Island Pines]] Botel) on [[Fire Island]], helping to build up a significant LGBT tourist presence in the resort and adjacent hamlet [[Cherry Grove, New York]] in the decades afterward.\n\nIn 1966 bisexual activist [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A. Martin (aka Donny the Punk)]] founded the Student Homophile League at Columbia University and New York University. In 1967 Columbia University officially recognized this group, thus making them the first college in the United States to officially recognize a gay student group.<ref name=\"binetusa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.binetusa.org/bihealth.html|title=TIMELINE: THE BISEXUAL HEALTH MOVEMENT IN THE US|publisher=BiNetUSA|access-date=2013-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207185405/http://www.binetusa.org/bihealth.html|archive-date=2019-02-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1966, the first case to consider transsexualism in the US was heard, ''Mtr. of Anonymous v. Weiner, 50 Misc. 2d 380, 270 N.Y.S.2d 319 (1966)''. The case concerned a transsexual person from New York City who had undergone sex reassignment surgery and wanted a change of name and sex on their birth certificate. The New York City Health Department refused to grant the request, and the court ruled that the New York City and New Jersey Health Code only permitted a change of sex on the birth certificate if an error was made recording it at birth, so the Health Department acted correctly. The decision of the court in ''Weiner'' was affirmed in ''Mtr. of Hartin v. Dir. of Bur. of Recs., 75 Misc. 2d 229, 232, 347 N.Y.S.2d 515 (1973)'' and ''Anonymous v.

A new period of liberalism in the late 1960s began a new era of more social acceptance for homosexuality which lasted until the late 1970s. In the 1970s, the popularity of [[disco]] music and its culture in many ways made society more accepting of gays and lesbians. In 1971, the first version of the [[Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act]] was introduced into both houses of the state legislature. In 1974, the Village of [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred]] (pop. 1,000) became the first municipality in the state to pass a gay rights ordinance which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\nIn 1972 bisexual activist Don Fass founded the [[National Bisexual Liberation Group]] in New York City, which issued ''The Bisexual Expression'', most likely the earliest bisexual newsletter.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nThe [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]] were created in 1974.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=8mJN7pcpERAC&pg=PA7&dq=San+Francisco+summer+of+love+gays#v=onepage&q=San%20Francisco%20summer%20of%20love%20gays&f=false |title = My Desire for History: Essays in Gay, Community, and Labor History|isbn = 9780807877982|last1 = B\u00e9rub\u00e9|first1 = Allan|date = June 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Conditions (magazine)|Conditions]], a feminist magazine emphasizing writing by lesbians, was created in 1976, and continued until 1990, featuring writing by [[Audre Lorde]], [[Jewelle Gomez]], [[Paula Gunn Allen]], and others.<ref name=\"bsmith\">Smith, Barbara.

At the time, it was only one of three weekly LGBT publications in the world, and the first to be owned by an African-American.\n\nLate in 1979, a new [[Revivalism|religious revival]] ushered in the conservatism that would reign in the United States during the 1980s and made life hard once again for LGBT people.\n\n===1980\u20131989===\nThe [[New York Court of Appeals]] case ''[[New York v.

In 1983, the [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center]] was established in [[New York City]].\n\nIn 1985, the [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] was formed by a group of gay and lesbian artisans in New York City.\n\nIn 1981, [[AIDS/HIV]] was discovered and announced, leading to several more cases of the disease from around the world in the decades ahead. Among other LGBT communities, the New York LGBT community was hit especially hard by the epidemic, with many dying due to transmission. It galvanized local playwright and novelist [[Larry Kramer]] into activism, first helping to establish the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] organization in 1982 before being kicked out of the organization for his militancy. Kramer then established the [[direct action]]-oriented organization [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]] in 1987, a national organization which would target several prominent organizations, the government and businesses for their apathy to AIDS/HIV victims.\n\nOn December 10, 1989, ACT UP and WHAM led a protest of at least 4,500 protesters, known as \"[[Stop the Church]]\", which managed to infiltrate the [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (New York)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] before some 150 protesters were arrested. It was the largest demonstration against a religious organization in U.S. history.\n\nAn October 1989 Cosmopolitan magazine article that stereotyped bisexual men as dishonest spreaders of AIDS led to a letter-writing campaign by the New York Area Bisexual Network (NYABN). Cosmopolitan has printed no articles defaming bisexuals since the campaign.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\n===1990\u20131999===\nIn 1990, [[Deborah Glick]], who is lesbian, became the first openly LGBT member of the State House of Representatives.\n\nNew York City Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] signed recognition of a municipal [[domestic partnership]]s registry into law in 1997.\n\n==21st century==\n\n===2000\u20132010===\nIn 2002, the [[Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act]] was passed by the Legislature.

Still in existence today, SRLP was named after transgender activist [[Sylvia Rivera]] with the mission \"to guarantee that all people are free to self-determine gender identity and expression, regardless of income or race, and without facing harassment, discrimination or violence\".\n\nIn 2005, bisexual scholars and activists mobilized with The Task Force, GLAAD and [[BiNet USA]] to meet with New York Times science section editor and researcher Brian Dodge to respond to misinformation the paper had published on a study about bisexual men.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> The study, entitled ''Sexual Arousal Patterns of Bisexual Men,'' by the controversial researcher [[J.

This resulted in all legally married same-sex couples in the United States qualifying for federal marriage benefits, and was decided on the same day as the Supreme Court's decision to deny standing for appeal in ''[[Hollingsworth v.

Sexual relations between persons of the same gender (variously described as \"sodomy\", \"buggery\" or \"sins of carnal nature\") was illegal for most of the history of New York from its days as a Dutch colony through its colonization and independence from British rule as a state in the Union, until such relations were legalized by judicial action in 1981. Activism for the rights of LGBT people in the state began with the rise of protest actions by the first \"[[homophile]]\" organizations in the 1950s and 1960s, although LGBT activism was propelled into a watershed moment in the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]] and the later protests against the apathy of civil and political institutions to the AIDS/HIV crisis. Various organizations were established for LGBT people to advocate for rights and provide human services, the impact of which was increasingly felt at state level.\n\nThe most recent culminations of LGBT rights in New York include the passage of the [[Marriage Equality Act (New York)|Marriage Equality Act]] in June 2011, granting the legalization of [[same-sex marriage in New York|same-sex marriage]] to New York residents, and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the New York-originated landmark case ''United States v.

The [[New Netherland]] colony did not retain Dutch criminal law, but the [[Dutch West India Company|West India Company]], which was given legislative powers, gave the rulers of the colony powers to punish capital offenses, which may have included sodomy due to recorded punishments for the crime.\n\nIn 1646, the first sodomy trial in the territory of New Netherland convicted [[Jan Creoli]] on a second offense of sodomy and sentenced him to death by strangulation; his body was then \"burned to ashes\". A second accused, [[Nicolas Hillebrant]] (or Hillebrantsen), was scheduled for a trial in 1658, but no further records indicate progress in the trial or an outcome; a third conviction in 1660, that of [[Jan Quisthout van der Linde]] (or Linden), who was accused of having had sex with his male servant, resulted in his being tied in a sack and dunked into a river to drown, while the servant was flogged.<ref>Shorto, Russell, ''The Island at the Center of the World: The Epic Story of Dutch Manhattan and the Forgotten Colony that Shaped America'' {{ISBN|0-385-50349-0}} (New York, Doubleday, 2004). [http://www.randomhouse.com/features/island/]</ref>\n\nThis status quo of the death penalty for sodomy would remain unchanged after New Netherland was taken by the [[Duke of York]] in 1664, and \"[[buggery]]\" was retained as a capital offense. However, a portion of modern New York fell from 1674 to 1702 within the northern portion of Quaker-ruled [[West Jersey]], whose criminal code was silent on sodomy.\n\nIn 1796, the state's punishment for sodomy was reduced from death to a maximum of 14 years at either solitude or hard labor.\n\n==19th century==\nNew York, as America's largest city, almost doubled population during the first half of the 19th century (from 1800 to 1820 and again by 1840 to 300 000). The city saw the beginnings of a homosexual subculture concomitantly growing with the population.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\">Edsall, Nicholas C., Towards Stonewall. Virginia UP. Pg. 127\u2013152. 2003.</ref>\n\n===Sodomy laws===\nNew York's sodomy laws remained in flux, when an 1801 law raised the punishment to compulsory life imprisonment, with hard labor or solitary confinement as additional attachments; the law was reduced in 1828 to a maximum of 10 years and an expunging of the hard labor and solitude options. The law was again changed in 1881, with sodomy now limited to a maximum of 5\u201320 years. A revision in 1892 eliminated the 5-year minimum.\n\nThe first reported sodomy case in the state's history, ''Lambertson v. People'' (1861), resulted in a conviction for buggery. An 1898 case was prosecuted by the [[New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]], involving a man to allegedly assist another teenage boy to engage in sodomy with another teenage minor. [[Young Griffo]], an Australian featherweight champion boxer, was accused in 1895 for \"Oscar Wildeism\" with a boy; he pleaded \"not guilty\" to the accusation, but no further information exists regarding the outcome of the trial.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Columbus Press-Post|date=May 25, 1895|page=Page 1}}</ref>\n\n===Poetic descriptions===\nContinuing the theme of loving male friendship, the American poet, [[Walt Whitman]] arrived in New York in 1841.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He is widely believed to have been bisexual or gay, and was immediately drawn to young working class men found in certain parks, public baths, the docks, and some bars and dance halls.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> He kept records of the men and boys, usually noting age, physical characteristics, job, and origins.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  Dispersed in his praise of the city are moments of male admiration, such as in ''Calamus''\u2014 \u201cfrequent and swift flash of eyes offering me robust, athletic love\u201d or in poem Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, where he writes:\n\n\"Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me / approaching or passing, / Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as / I sat, / Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a / word, / Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, / Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, / The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, / Or as small as we like, or both great and small.\"<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nSometimes Whitman's writing verged on explicit, such as in his poem, Native Moments\u2014 \u201cI share the midnight orgies of young men / I pick out some low person for my dearest friend. He shall be lawless, rude, illiterate.\u201d<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> Poems like these and Calamus (inspired by Whitman's treasured friends and possible lover, Fred Vaughan who lived with the Whitman family in the 1850s) and the general theme of manly love, functioned as a pseudonym for homosexuality.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  The developing sub-community had a coded voice to draw more gay and bisexual men to New York and other growing American urban centers. Whitman did, however, in 1890 denounce any sexuality in the comradeship of his works and historians still debate whether he was a practicing homosexual, bisexual, etc.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/> But this denouncement shows that homosexuality had become a public question by the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>\n\nTwenty years after Whitman came to New York, [[Horatio Alger]] continued the theme of manly love in his stories of the young Victorian [[self-made man]].<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C. Pg. 69-84\"/>  He came to New York fleeing from a public scandal with a young man in Cape Cod that forced him to leave the ministry, in 1866.<ref name=\"Edsall, Nicholas C.

P. Dutton]] in New York. It was the first post-World War II novel whose openly gay and well-adjusted protagonist is not killed off at the end of the story for defying social norms. It is also recognized as one of the \"definitive war-influenced gay novels\", being one of the few books of its period dealing directly with male homosexuality. The book's publication caused a major literary scandal, with the ''[[New York Times]]'' refusing to publish it and Vidal's books being blacklisted from most major critical publications for the next six years, forcing Vidal to write and publish under pseudonyms until his reputation recovered.\n\n===1950\u20131969===\nIn 1950, New York made legal history when it became the first state in the Union to reduce sodomy to a misdemeanor, with a maximum penalty of six months in prison. Nevertheless, anti-LGBT policies continued unabated, and residents in the [[gay village]]s of New York City began to increasingly become disenchanted with silent acceptance of police raids. The New York chapter of the [[Mattachine Society]] was established in 1955 (incorporated in 1961), and [[Barbara Gittings]] established the New York chapter of the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] September 20, 1958.\n\nThe election of Mayor [[John Lindsay]] in 1965 signaled a major shift in city politics, and a new attitude toward sexual mores began changing the social atmosphere of New York. On April 21, 1966, [[Dick Leitsch]], president of the New York [[Mattachine Society]] and two other members staged the Sip-in at the [[Julius (New York City)|Julius]] bar on West 10th Street in Greenwich Village. This resulted in the [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] accommodation rules of the [[New York State Liquor Authority|NY State Liquor Authority]] being overturned in subsequent court actions. These SLA provisions declared that it was illegal for homosexuals to congregate and be served alcoholic beverages in bars. An example of when these laws had been upheld is in 1940 when Gloria's, a bar that had been closed for such violations, fought the case in court and lost. Prior to this change in the law, the business of running a gay bar had to involve paying bribes to the police and Mafia. As soon as the law was altered, the SLA ceased closing legally licensed gay bars and such bars could no longer be prosecuted for serving gays and lesbians. Mattachine pressed this advantage very quickly and Mayor Lindsay was confronted with the issue of police entrapment in gay bars, resulting in this practice being stopped. On the heels of this victory, the mayor cooperated in getting questions about homosexuality removed from NYC hiring practices. The police and fire departments resisted the new policy, however, and refused to cooperate. The result of these changes in the law, combined with the open social- and sexual-attitudes of the late Sixties, led to the increased visibility of gay life in New York. Several licensed gay bars were in operation in [[Greenwich Village]] and the [[Upper West Side]], as well as illegal, unlicensed places serving alcohol, such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] and the Snakepit, both in Greenwich Village. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of violent conflicts between gay men, drag queens and lesbians against a police officer raid in New York City. The first night of rioting began on Friday, June 28, 1969 at about 1:20&nbsp;am, when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar operating without a state license in Greenwich Village. ''Stonewall'' is considered a turning point for the modern [[gay rights]] movement worldwide. Newspaper coverage of the events was minor in the city, since, in the Sixties, huge marches and mass rioting had become commonplace and the Stonewall disturbances were relatively small.\n\nIt was also after 1959 that former male model [[John B. Whyte]] bought the Pines Hotel (renamed the [[Fire Island Pines]] Botel) on [[Fire Island]], helping to build up a significant LGBT tourist presence in the resort and adjacent hamlet [[Cherry Grove, New York]] in the decades afterward.\n\nIn 1966 bisexual activist [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A. Martin (aka Donny the Punk)]] founded the Student Homophile League at Columbia University and New York University. In 1967 Columbia University officially recognized this group, thus making them the first college in the United States to officially recognize a gay student group.<ref name=\"binetusa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.binetusa.org/bihealth.html|title=TIMELINE: THE BISEXUAL HEALTH MOVEMENT IN THE US|publisher=BiNetUSA|access-date=2013-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207185405/http://www.binetusa.org/bihealth.html|archive-date=2019-02-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1966, the first case to consider transsexualism in the US was heard, ''Mtr. of Anonymous v. Weiner, 50 Misc. 2d 380, 270 N.Y.S.2d 319 (1966)''. The case concerned a transsexual person from New York City who had undergone sex reassignment surgery and wanted a change of name and sex on their birth certificate. The New York City Health Department refused to grant the request, and the court ruled that the New York City and New Jersey Health Code only permitted a change of sex on the birth certificate if an error was made recording it at birth, so the Health Department acted correctly. The decision of the court in ''Weiner'' was affirmed in ''Mtr. of Hartin v. Dir. of Bur. of Recs., 75 Misc. 2d 229, 232, 347 N.Y.S.2d 515 (1973)'' and ''Anonymous v.

A new period of liberalism in the late 1960s began a new era of more social acceptance for homosexuality which lasted until the late 1970s. In the 1970s, the popularity of [[disco]] music and its culture in many ways made society more accepting of gays and lesbians. In 1971, the first version of the [[Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act]] was introduced into both houses of the state legislature. In 1974, the Village of [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred]] (pop. 1,000) became the first municipality in the state to pass a gay rights ordinance which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\nIn 1972 bisexual activist Don Fass founded the [[National Bisexual Liberation Group]] in New York City, which issued ''The Bisexual Expression'', most likely the earliest bisexual newsletter.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nThe [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]] were created in 1974.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=8mJN7pcpERAC&pg=PA7&dq=San+Francisco+summer+of+love+gays#v=onepage&q=San%20Francisco%20summer%20of%20love%20gays&f=false |title = My Desire for History: Essays in Gay, Community, and Labor History|isbn = 9780807877982|last1 = B\u00e9rub\u00e9|first1 = Allan|date = June 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Conditions (magazine)|Conditions]], a feminist magazine emphasizing writing by lesbians, was created in 1976, and continued until 1990, featuring writing by [[Audre Lorde]], [[Jewelle Gomez]], [[Paula Gunn Allen]], and others.<ref name=\"bsmith\">Smith, Barbara.

At the time, it was only one of three weekly LGBT publications in the world, and the first to be owned by an African-American.\n\nLate in 1979, a new [[Revivalism|religious revival]] ushered in the conservatism that would reign in the United States during the 1980s and made life hard once again for LGBT people.\n\n===1980\u20131989===\nThe [[New York Court of Appeals]] case ''[[New York v. Onofre]]'' abolished most remaining laws regarding sodomy in New York. In 1983, the [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center]] was established in [[New York City]].\n\nIn 1985, the [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] was formed by a group of gay and lesbian artisans in New York City.\n\nIn 1981, [[AIDS/HIV]] was discovered and announced, leading to several more cases of the disease from around the world in the decades ahead. Among other LGBT communities, the New York LGBT community was hit especially hard by the epidemic, with many dying due to transmission. It galvanized local playwright and novelist [[Larry Kramer]] into activism, first helping to establish the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] organization in 1982 before being kicked out of the organization for his militancy. Kramer then established the [[direct action]]-oriented organization [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]] in 1987, a national organization which would target several prominent organizations, the government and businesses for their apathy to AIDS/HIV victims.\n\nOn December 10, 1989, ACT UP and WHAM led a protest of at least 4,500 protesters, known as \"[[Stop the Church]]\", which managed to infiltrate the [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (New York)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] before some 150 protesters were arrested. It was the largest demonstration against a religious organization in U.S. history.\n\nAn October 1989 Cosmopolitan magazine article that stereotyped bisexual men as dishonest spreaders of AIDS led to a letter-writing campaign by the New York Area Bisexual Network (NYABN). Cosmopolitan has printed no articles defaming bisexuals since the campaign.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\n===1990\u20131999===\nIn 1990, [[Deborah Glick]], who is lesbian, became the first openly LGBT member of the State House of Representatives.\n\nNew York City Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] signed recognition of a municipal [[domestic partnership]]s registry into law in 1997.\n\n==21st century==\n\n===2000\u20132010===\nIn 2002, the [[Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act]] was passed by the Legislature.

Still in existence today, SRLP was named after transgender activist [[Sylvia Rivera]] with the mission \"to guarantee that all people are free to self-determine gender identity and expression, regardless of income or race, and without facing harassment, discrimination or violence\".\n\nIn 2005, bisexual scholars and activists mobilized with The Task Force, GLAAD and [[BiNet USA]] to meet with New York Times science section editor and researcher Brian Dodge to respond to misinformation the paper had published on a study about bisexual men.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> The study, entitled ''Sexual Arousal Patterns of Bisexual Men,'' by the controversial researcher [[J.

This resulted in all legally married same-sex couples in the United States qualifying for federal marriage benefits, and was decided on the same day as the Supreme Court's decision to deny standing for appeal in ''[[Hollingsworth v.
