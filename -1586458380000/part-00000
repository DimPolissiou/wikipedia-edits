Most church murals in Sweden are from this time, and Albertus Pictor the most well-known artist of the time.]]\n\n'''Church murals''' or '''church wall paintings''' are decorative paintings, mostly [[Middle Ages|medieval]], found in several Swedish [[Church (building)|churches]] where they adorn the [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] or walls of the buildings. In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] they are sometimes referred to as ''kalkm\u00e5lningar'', literally \"lime paintings\", since they were often painted using [[Lime (material)|lime]] as binding medium for the paint. The earliest church murals in Sweden date from the first decades of the 12th century and are [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] in style. The majority of these are found in the southern part of Sweden, where they were commissioned by members of the royalty and nobility of the time. They all have certain iconogprahic similarities, and for the most part show stylistic influences from contemporary art in present-day Germany. While it has been assumed that the artists making these murals were well-educated, and the first of them foreigners, virtually nothing is known about their identity. Around 1250, there is a stylistic shift towards [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style. The composition of the murals becomes lighter and more airy, and some iconographic changes also take place. [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Marian]] themes and [[Christian mysticism]] become more popular. Early and High Gothic murals are preserved particularly on [[Gotland]], where many new churches were built at this time, and in [[Scania]], where many old churches were equipped with new [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] which were then decorated. The earliest known names of the artists making church murals date from this time.\n\nThe majority of the murals however date from the 15th and early 16th centuries, when many churches were built or rebuilt in particular in the provinces around Lake [[M\u00e4laren]]. These Late Gothic murals are more variegated than the earlier Gothic murals, and the decoration more profuse. These murals tend to cover the entire painted surface. There is also a shift towards more narrative painting, and [[Didacticism|didactic]] and moralising subjects become more common. The iconography on the whole is more fragmented and the paintings often done with much less of an overarching principle than before. A number of artists and workshops from the late Middle Ages are known by name, the most well-known of which is [[Albertus Pictor]]. The workshops typically consisted of three people, including the master, and worked with paintings church murals only during the summer months. They used a variety of [[pigment]]s, and the palette of the artists expanded as the Middle Ages progressed.  After the [[Reformation in Sweden|Reformation]], new church murals were occasionally still made, but during the late 17th century and in particular during the 18th and early 19th centuries, most murals were covered with [[whitewash]]. Many of them have later been uncovered again and restored, in particular during the 20th century. Today there is a large number of church murals in Sweden, compared to other European countries, and the [[Swedish History Museum]] describes them as a \"unique treasure\".\n\n==History==\n===Romanesque murals===\n[[File:Bj\u00e4resj\u00f6 kyrka 7.jpg|thumb|right|Romanesque murals in [[Bj\u00e4resj\u00f6 Church]], some of the oldest in Sweden (early 13th century).

Their style is Italo-Byzantine, similar to other European murals from the first half of the 12th century, and particularly the murals in {{ill|Sigwardskirche|de|Sigwardskirche (Idensen)}} close to [[Hanover]] in north western Germany.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=310\u2013311}} For the most part, for example in the well-preserved murals in [[Bj\u00e4resj\u00f6 Church]], stylistic influences came from present-day Germany.{{sfn|Nilsson|2015|p=139}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=328}} In some cases, stylistic influences may be discernible from France ([[Knislinge Church]] and {{ill|H\u00f6\u00f6r Church|sv|H\u00f6\u00f6rs kyrka}}){{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=328}} as well as (possibly) [[Lombardy]] ({{ill|Vinsl\u00f6v Church|sv|Vinsl\u00f6vs kyrka}}).{{sfn|Lindgren|1971|p=117}} A few early murals in churches on [[Gotland]] are of a Russo-Byzantine style; of these the paintings in [[Garde Church]] ({{circa}} 1200) are the most well-preserved.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=296}}{{sfn|Cutler|1969|p=259}}\n\n===Early and High Gothic murals===\nA stylistic change from what is generally known as Romanesque art to [[Gothic art]] took place {{circa}} 1250 in Sweden.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=309}} The time span between approximately 1250 and 1300 is sometimes referred to as Early Gothic and the time {{circa}} 1300-1380 as High Gothic.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=309}} In broad terms, the [[iconography]] of the murals remained similar. Some changes did however take place in the choice of subject matter. There were also stylistic changes.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=317}} \n\nDuring the 13th century, the [[Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church|veneration of Mary]] grew stronger, and Marian themes therefore became more popular subjects. For example, the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] appears more commonly.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=318}} During the 14th century, a greater interest in [[Christian mysticism]] can also be seen among the choice of subject matter for the paintings (e.g. the [[Mass of Saint Gregory]]), paired with a shift in focus from representing Christ as triumphant to representations of Christ as suffering during the Passion. Purely decorative paintings also appear during this time period.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=318\u2013319}} \n\nStylistically, the Early and High Gothic period marks a shift towards a lighter scale of colours. The paintings no longer cover entire surfaces, as during the Romaneqsue period, but instead stand out against the white background of the walls.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=323}} New opportunities for decorations were provided when wooden church ceilings and [[barrel vault]]s began to be replaced by [[groin vault]]s.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=323}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=92}} The earliest of these are purely decorative, with no figurative representations.{{sfn|Nilsson|2015|p=139}} The stylistic influences came, by and large, from [[Westphalia]] and [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], often transmitted via [[L\u00fcbeck]].{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=93}} A large amount of both Early and High Gothic church murals can be found in the churches on Gotland, which experienced a period of economic growth in the period {{circa}} 1250\u20131350, and in Scania, where many older churches were rebuilt and equipped with [[brick]] vaults during the 14th century.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=309}} In many murals on Gotland, e.g. those in [[Vamlingbo Church]], a particularly strong influence from Westphalian contemporary art, Byzantinesque in style, has been noted.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=334\u2013335}} Although both Early and High Gothic murals in Scania remained conservative and stylistically close to Romanesque art, some new subjects, such as the [[Rota Fortunae|Wheel of Fortune]], were introduced. Humans are represented as elongated and swaying, with gently flowing folds in their dress, in contrast to the earlier, more hieratic Romanesque figures.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=352}}{{sfn|Nilsson|2015|p=139\u201340}} The style of High Gothic murals are generally similar to Early Gothic, but coarser and heavier in their execution, exemplified e.g. by the murals in [[Gothem Church]] on Gotland.{{sfn|Lindgren|2015|p=338\u2013339}}\n\n===Late Gothic murals===\n[[File:Rasbokils kyrka int02.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The interior of [[Rasbokil Church]]. Like many other churches in the region around Lake M\u00e4laren, the entire church interior was decorated with murals during the late Middle Ages; these date from {{circa}} 1520. They have been covered with whitewash and were uncovered in the 20th century.]]\nThe vast majority, perhaps as much as 75 percent, of the medieval church murals of Sweden date from the 15th and early 16th centuries.{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=40}} Some of the earliest examples of this Late Gothic style can be found in the [[chapter house]] of [[Vadstena Abbey]]. These murals were probably made during the last decades of the 14th century and display a both stylistic and iconographic influence from northern Germany, particularly [[Master Bertram]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=359}} It is however mainly the area around Lake M\u00e4laren, particularly [[Uppland]] and [[V\u00e4stmanland]], which sees a dramatic increase in production of church murals between {{circa}} 1435 and 1500.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=385}} Economic development meant that new churches could be built and old ones refurbished; almost all the churches in the region were equipped with brick vaults which were then decorated.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=385}} Archbishop [[Jakob Ulvsson]] (1430s \u2013 1521) also encouraged the development and his [[coat of arms]] is painted in several of the churches from this time.{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=178\u2013180}} The rate at which churches in the vicinity of Stockholm during the 15th century were decorated with paintings has been described as \"epidemic\".{{sfn|Cornell|Wallin|1917|p=10}} A substantial number of murals dating from this time can also be found in [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland|V\u00e4ster-]] and [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]], as well as in Scania. Late Gothic murals which are similar to those from the M\u00e4laren region can also be found in [[Dalarna]], [[Norrland]], and also in Finland.{{efn|Finland was a part of Sweden until the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] in 1809.}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=41}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=386\u2013387}} The northernmost church with Late Gothic murals is [[Nederlule\u00e5 Church]] in [[Norrbotten]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=399}}\n\nDuring this time, Marian themes became more popular than ever before, and also more varied (representations include the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] and the Hunt for the [[Unicorn]]). There was an increase in paintings of [[saint]]s and their [[Legendary material in Christian hagiography|legends]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=321}} The pictorial programme of the church became more fragmented, and subjects and motifs were more often than before mixed without a strong overarching principle.{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=206}} Still, some general tendencies can be observed, at least in the churches in Uppland. The [[choir (architecture)|choir]] would often contain scenes from the life of Christ, or Marian subjects. The [[nave]] often contained illustrations from the [[Old Testament]], and the often spacious [[church porch]]es usually contained more profane subjects.{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=178}} [[Didacticism|Didactic art]] became more prevalent, as well as moralising subjects \u2014 including the many depcitions of devils in mural art from this time.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=322}}{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=176}} \n\nOn the whole, Late Gothic paintings are more narrative and less decorative than earlier Gothic murals. Humans are depicted more linearly, with sharper contours and more solid volumes, and the ornamentation is more varied, detailed and richer.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=378}}{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=176}} The murals tend to cover all or most of the painted surface, and the entire church interior was typically decorated, i.e. both the walls and the vaults.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=378}}{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=176}} The palette of colours is extended and there is a tendency towards exuberance or gaudiness.{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=207\u2013208}} [[Woodcut]]s and [[Biblia pauperum|Paupers' Bibles]] were used as examples by the artists (though pure copies were rare).{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=206\u2013207}} During this time, influences from [[Early Netherlandish painting]], including attempts at [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], can be seen in a few of the murals; again probably via German transposition (some of the artists such as [[Albertus Pictor]] and {{ill|Johannes Rosenrod|sv}} were themselves German).{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=41}} On the whole, however, church murals continued to be made in a vernacular, decorative style and incorporated few elements of the nascent Renaissance from the rest of Europe.{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=208}}\n\n===Later decorations, maltreatment and restorations===\nUnlike in some other countries, the [[Reformation in Sweden]] during the 16th century was not accompanied by any widespread [[iconoclasm]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=322}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=14}} Most church murals remained unspoiled, and were occasionally even restored, after the Reformation. The lack of any major wars on Swedish soil since the Middle Ages has furthermore contributed to preserving many of the murals.<ref name=historiska2>{{cite web |url= http://medeltidbild.historiska.se/medeltidbild/typforemal/kalkmalning/default.asp|title= Kalkm\u00e5lningar|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= Medeltidens bildv\u00e4rld|language=Swedish|publisher= [[Swedish History Museum]]|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref> Some completely new church murals were also made during the 17th and 18th centuries, often conservative, almost medieval, in style.{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=15\u201318}} During the end of the 17th century however, church murals began to be covered with [[whitewash]] in several churches. It has been suggested that a growing emphasis on Protetant Orthodoxy within the [[Church of Sweden]] led to a less tolerant attitude towards the murals.{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=19}} In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a more systematic covering of murals took place, on stylistic rather than theological grounds: the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] ideals of the time valued un-decorated, white church interiors more highly than the historical murals.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=322}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=21}} Only a fragmentary amount of the church murals in Sweden have survived untouched until today; most of them were at some point covered with whitewash.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=322}} From the late 19th century, and in particular during the 20th century, murals began to be restored and uncovered again. Sometimes these \"restorations\" in turn led to further deterioration and destruction of the murals.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=323}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=21\u201333}} In general terms, however, there exists today an unusually large number of murals in Sweden, compared to in other European countries, and the [[Swedish History Museum]] describes them as a \"unique treasure\".<ref name=historiska2/>{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=309}}\n\n==Technique==\nDuring the Middle Ages paintings were made both on wood and stone, but most are found in stone churches.<ref name=historiska2/> The oldest church murals, from the Romanesque period, were painted using a combination of ''[[Fresco|affresco]]'' and ''[[Fresco-secco|a secco]]'' techniques.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=300\u2013303}} The bare wall was first covered with a thick layer of coarse [[plaster]] which was then covered with whitewash and pierced, as a foundation for a fine layer of smooth plaster. While still moist, contours were painted on this layer using [[ochre|red ochre]]. Colours based on [[earth pigment]]s, [[carbon black]] and [[white lead]] were also applied ''al fresco''.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=301}} Some colours were however based on pigments which were ruined if applied on a wet surface, and were thus applied in a second stage on the dry wall, or ''a secco''. Paints thus applied included shades of green (pigments based on [[copper]] or [[malachite]]), [[ultramarine]] (pigments made from [[lapis lazuli]], used rarely in Swedish church murals) and red (pigments based on [[cinnabar]]).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=301\u2013302}} Other pigments found in church murals from the 12th and 13th centuries are [[green earth]], [[atacamite]], [[Lead(II,IV) oxide|minium]], [[massicot]] and [[azurite]],{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2010|p=51}}{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=336}} though common and simple pigments dominate.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=340}} Decorating a Romanesque church with murals was nonetheless a costly undertaking due to the expensive materials used as pigments.{{sfn|Nilsson|2015|p=139}} In addition, Romanesque murals were sometimes augmented by lightly sculpted elements: [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] of saints could be sculpted in [[stucco]] and [[gilding|gilded]], or decorated with small balls of white paint intended to mimic [[pearl]]s. Sometimes gilded copper plates were also attached to highlight certain elements. It's also possible that some murals were decorated with [[rock crystal]]s.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=302}} Throughout the Middle Ages, lime was used as binding medium for the paint, but occasionally [[casein]], [[erucic acid]] and [[drying oil]]s were used.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=56\u201357}}\n\nFrom {{circa}} 1200 the technique partially changed. Instead of working on a smooth layer of plaster, the painters now painted directly on a rougher, more uneven layer of plaster. Some elements were still painted ''affresco'' but painting ''a secco'' dominated.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=316}} Contours were carved into the wet surface instead of painted, as before. Towards the end of the Middle Ages, the technique changed again: now the contours were typically drawn using charcoal or sometimes a pigment based on [[iron oxide]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=317}} After the outlines had been made, the paints were applied, and lastly text (in the form of [[speech scroll]]s) and [[stencil]]ed details and patterns put in place.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=338}} The palette of pigments expanded and changed as the Middle Ages progressed.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=336}} [[Albertus Pictor]], working at the end of the 15th and early 16th century, for example used [[lead-tin-yellow]], [[orpiment]] and [[Naples yellow]] in addition to pigments already mentioned.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2018|p=95}} His workshop furthermore imported several pigments, probably from Germany.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2018|p=98}} Albertus Pictor also used [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazes]] on some details.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=338}}\n\nMany of these colours have faded or changed over time.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=317}}{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=338\u2013339}} Some light, lead-based pigments tend to oxidize into darker [[plattnerite]] when painted, as was the rule, on lime background (but not when painted on wood).{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=338}} Similarly, cinnabar red has occasionally turned into [[metacinnabar]]. In addition, organic pigments such as [[brazilin]] have faded by exposure to sunlight.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=338}} In the Romanesque murals, the pigments used in painting ''a secco'' \u2013 typically details, such as eyes, and the most vibrant colours \u2013 have not been absorbed by the underlying material as well, and thus have a tendency to come off more easily, leaving only the ''affresco'' layer of the mural visible. This is particularly true in cases where the paintings have been covered with whitewash at a later date. If and when the whitewash is removed, the ''a secco'' layer often also falls off.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=303}}\n\n==Artists==\n[[File:Albertus Pictor selfportrait cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Self-portrait by Albertus Pictor in Lid Church]]\nThe technical execution as well as the iconography indicate that the artists who made the Romanesque murals were well educated.{{sfn|Nilsson|2015|p=139}} Overall, however, very little is known about the artists and workshops who made the earliest murals in Swedish churches.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=310}} A few murals from the 13th century are signed, two in [[rune]]s ({{ill|D\u00e4desj\u00f6 Old Church|sv|D\u00e4desj\u00f6 gamla kyrka}}, by Sigmund, and [[Anga Church, Gotland|Anga Church]], by Halvard) and one in [[Letter_case#Majuscule|majuscles]] ({{ill|Veta Church|sv|Veta kyrka}} by Magnus).{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=331}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=46}} Nothing further is however known about these artist.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=310}} More detailed records about artists and workshops exist in some cases from the middle of the 15th century and onward. The names of several of these artists have been preserved, either by signatures and inscriptions in the churches, or preserved in city [[archive]]s such as those in [[Stockholm]] and [[Arboga]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=310}} [[Albertus Pictor]] is the most well-known of these Late Gothic artists, who acquired fame and a following already in his lifetime.{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=182}} His signature is known from six churches, and {{ill|Lid Church|sv|Lids kyrka}} also contains a self-portrait by him.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=313}} His name is also mentioned in the city archives of Stockholm.{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=183}} In other cases, where no written sources exist, art historians have assigned [[notname]]s to groups of works either assumed to have been made by the same workshop or more loosely, works showing certain stylistic relations with each other.{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=180}}\n\nThe artists who were active during the late Middle Ages typically worked in workshops consisting of a master and one or two [[journeyman|journeymen]] and/or [[apprentice]]s. They often operated from a city and decorated the churches in the vicinity. Apart from murals, their work probably also encompassed the painting of [[altarpiece]]s, textiles and other religious objects. Many of the artists seem to have done other kinds of artistic work as well; some are noted as [[glazier]] and carpenters, in addition to painters, in the archives.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=310}}\n\nThe murals were painted during the warm months of the year, typically between early April and mid-August. If the work couldn't be finished during the summer months, they were resumed the following spring.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=310}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of church murals in Sweden]]\n*[[Church frescos in Denmark]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n*{{cite book |last1= Anund|first1= Johan|last2=Qvistr\u00f6m|first2=Linda|date= 2012|title= Det medeltida Uppland: en arkeologisk guidebok|trans-title= Medieval Uppland: an acrhaeological guide book|url= http://libris.kb.se/bib/12345707rn/mode/1up/|language= Swedish|location= Lund|publisher= Historiska Media|isbn=978-91-85873-74-6|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Augustsson|editor1-first=Jan-Erik|last= Lindgren|first= Mereth|date= 1996|title=Signums svenska konsthistoria.

Most church murals in Sweden are from this time, and Albertus Pictor the most well-known artist of the time.]]\n\n'''Church murals''' or '''church wall paintings''' are decorative paintings, mostly [[Middle Ages|medieval]], found in several Swedish [[Church (building)|churches]] where they adorn the [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] or walls of the buildings. In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] they are sometimes referred to as ''kalkm\u00e5lningar'', literally \"lime paintings\", since they were often painted using [[Lime (material)|lime]] as binding medium for the paint. The earliest church murals in Sweden date from the first decades of the 12th century and are [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] in style. The majority of these are found in the southern part of Sweden, where they were commissioned by members of the royalty and nobility of the time. They all have certain iconogprahic similarities, and for the most part show stylistic influences from contemporary art in present-day Germany. While it has been assumed that the artists making these murals were well-educated, and the first of them foreigners, virtually nothing is known about their identity. Around 1250, there is a stylistic shift towards [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style. The composition of the murals becomes lighter and more airy, and some iconographic changes also take place. [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Marian]] themes and [[Christian mysticism]] become more popular. Early and High Gothic murals are preserved particularly on [[Gotland]], where many new churches were built at this time, and in [[Scania]], where many old churches were equipped with new [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] which were then decorated. The earliest known names of the artists making church murals date from this time.\n\nThe majority of the murals however date from the 15th and early 16th centuries, when many churches were built or rebuilt in particular in the provinces around Lake [[M\u00e4laren]]. These Late Gothic murals are more variegated than the earlier Gothic murals, and the decoration more profuse. These murals tend to cover the entire painted surface. There is also a shift towards more narrative painting, and [[Didacticism|didactic]] and moralising subjects become more common. The iconography on the whole is more fragmented and the paintings often done with much less of an overarching principle than before. A number of artists and workshops from the late Middle Ages are known by name, the most well-known of which is [[Albertus Pictor]]. The workshops typically consisted of three people, including the master, and worked with paintings church murals only during the summer months. They used a variety of [[pigment]]s, and the palette of the artists expanded as the Middle Ages progressed.  After the [[Reformation in Sweden|Reformation]], new church murals were occasionally still made, but during the late 17th century and in particular during the 18th and early 19th centuries, most murals were covered with [[whitewash]].

Some changes did however take place in the choice of subject matter. There were also stylistic changes.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=317}} \n\nDuring the 13th century, the [[Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church|veneration of Mary]] grew stronger, and Marian themes therefore became more popular subjects. For example, the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] appears more commonly.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=318}} During the 14th century, a greater interest in [[Christian mysticism]] can also be seen among the choice of subject matter for the paintings (e.g. the [[Mass of Saint Gregory]]), paired with a shift in focus from representing Christ as triumphant to representations of Christ as suffering during the Passion. Purely decorative paintings also appear during this time period.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=318\u2013319}} \n\nStylistically, the Early and High Gothic period marks a shift towards a lighter scale of colours. The paintings no longer cover entire surfaces, as during the Romaneqsue period, but instead stand out against the white background of the walls.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=323}} New opportunities for decorations were provided when wooden church ceilings and [[barrel vault]]s began to be replaced by [[groin vault]]s.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=323}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=92}} The earliest of these are purely decorative, with no figurative representations.{{sfn|Nilsson|2015|p=139}} The stylistic influences came, by and large, from [[Westphalia]] and [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], often transmitted via [[L\u00fcbeck]].{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=93}} A large amount of both Early and High Gothic church murals can be found in the churches on Gotland, which experienced a period of economic growth in the period {{circa}} 1250\u20131350, and in Scania, where many older churches were rebuilt and equipped with [[brick]] vaults during the 14th century.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=309}} In many murals on Gotland, e.g. those in [[Vamlingbo Church]], a particularly strong influence from Westphalian contemporary art, Byzantinesque in style, has been noted.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=334\u2013335}} Although both Early and High Gothic murals in Scania remained conservative and stylistically close to Romanesque art, some new subjects, such as the [[Wheel of Fortune]], were introduced. Humans are represented as elongated and swaying, with gently flowing folds in their dress, in contrast to the earlier, more hieratic Romanesque figures.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=352}}{{sfn|Nilsson|2015|p=139\u201340}} The style of High Gothic murals are generally similar to Early Gothic, but coarser and heavier in their execution, exemplified e.g. by the murals in [[Gothem Church]] on Gotland.{{sfn|Lindgren|2015|p=338\u2013339}}\n\n===Late Gothic murals===\n[[File:Rasbokils kyrka int02.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The interior of [[Rasbokil Church]]. Like many other churches in the region around Lake M\u00e4laren, the entire church interior was decorated with murals during the late Middle Ages; these date from {{circa}} 1520. They have been covered with whitewash and were uncovered in the 20th century.]]\nThe vast majority, perhaps as much as 75 percent, of the medieval church murals of Sweden date from the 15th and early 16th centuries.{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=40}} Some of the earliest examples of this Late Gothic style can be found in the [[chapter house]] of [[Vadstena Abbey]]. These murals were probably made during the last decades of the 14th century and display a both stylistic and iconographic influence from northern Germany, particularly [[Master Bertram]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=359}} It is however mainly the area around Lake M\u00e4laren, particularly [[Uppland]] and [[V\u00e4stmanland]], which sees a dramatic increase in production of church murals between {{circa}} 1435 and 1500.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=385}} Economic development meant that new churches could be built and old ones refurbished; almost all the churches in the region were equipped with brick vaults which were then decorated.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=385}} Archbishop [[Jakob Ulvsson]] (1430s \u2013 1521) also encouraged the development and his [[coat of arms]] is painted in several of the churches from this time.{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=178\u2013180}} The rate at which churches in the vicinity of Stockholm during the 15th century were decorated with paintings has been described as \"epidemic\".{{sfn|Cornell|Wallin|1917|p=10}} A substantial number of murals dating from this time can also be found in [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland|V\u00e4ster-]] and [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]], as well as in Scania. Late Gothic murals which are similar to those from the M\u00e4laren region can also be found in [[Dalarna]], [[Norrland]], and also in Finland.{{efn|Finland was a part of Sweden until the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] in 1809.}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=41}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=386\u2013387}} The northernmost church with Late Gothic murals is [[Nederlule\u00e5 Church]] in [[Norrbotten]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=399}}\n\nDuring this time, Marian themes became more popular than ever before, and also more varied (representations include the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] and the Hunt for the [[Unicorn]]). There was an increase in paintings of [[saint]]s and their [[Legendary material in Christian hagiography|legends]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=321}} The pictorial programme of the church became more fragmented, and subjects and motifs were more often than before mixed without a strong overarching principle.{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=206}} Still, some general tendencies can be observed, at least in the churches in Uppland. The [[choir (architecture)|choir]] would often contain scenes from the life of Christ, or Marian subjects. The [[nave]] often contained illustrations from the [[Old Testament]], and the often spacious [[church porch]]es usually contained more profane subjects.{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=178}} [[Didacticism|Didactic art]] became more prevalent, as well as moralising subjects \u2014 including the many depcitions of devils in mural art from this time.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=322}}{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=176}} \n\nOn the whole, Late Gothic paintings are more narrative and less decorative than earlier Gothic murals. Humans are depicted more linearly, with sharper contours and more solid volumes, and the ornamentation is more varied, detailed and richer.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=378}}{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=176}} The murals tend to cover all or most of the painted surface, and the entire church interior was typically decorated, i.e. both the walls and the vaults.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=378}}{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=176}} The palette of colours is extended and there is a tendency towards exuberance or gaudiness.{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=207\u2013208}} [[Woodcut]]s and [[Biblia pauperum|Paupers' Bibles]] were used as examples by the artists (though pure copies were rare).{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=206\u2013207}} During this time, influences from [[Early Netherlandish painting]], including attempts at [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], can be seen in a few of the murals; again probably via German transposition (some of the artists such as [[Albertus Pictor]] and {{ill|Johannes Rosenrod|sv}} were themselves German).{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=41}} On the whole, however, church murals continued to be made in a vernacular, decorative style and incorporated few elements of the nascent Renaissance from the rest of Europe.{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=208}}\n\n===Later decorations, maltreatment and restorations===\nUnlike in some other countries, the [[Reformation in Sweden]] during the 16th century was not accompanied by any widespread [[iconoclasm]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=322}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=14}} Most church murals remained unspoiled, and were occasionally even restored, after the Reformation.

It has been suggested that a growing emphasis on Protetant Orthodoxy within the [[Church of Sweden]] led to a less tolerant attitude towards the murals.{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=19}} In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a more systematic covering of murals took place, on stylistic rather than theological grounds: the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] ideals of the time valued un-decorated, white church interiors more highly than the historical murals.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=322}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=21}} Only a fragmentary amount of the church murals in Sweden have survived untouched until today; most of them were at some point covered with whitewash.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=322}} From the late 19th century, and in particular during the 20th century, murals began to be restored and uncovered again. Sometimes these \"restorations\" in turn led to further deterioration and destruction of the murals.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=323}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=21\u201333}} In general terms, however, there exists today an unusually large number of murals in Sweden, compared to in other European countries, and the [[Swedish History Museum]] describes them as a \"unique treasure\".<ref name=historiska2/>{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=309}}\n\n==Technique==\nDuring the Middle Ages paintings were made both on wood and stone, but most are found in stone churches.<ref name=historiska2/> The oldest church murals, from the Romanesque period, were painted using a combination of ''[[Fresco|affresco]]'' and ''[[Fresco-secco|a secco]]'' techniques.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=300\u2013303}} The bare wall was first covered with a thick layer of coarse [[plaster]] which was then covered with whitewash and pierced, as a foundation for a fine layer of smooth plaster. While still moist, contours were painted on this layer using [[ochre|red ochre]]. Colours based on [[earth pigment]]s, [[carbon black]] and [[white lead]] were also applied ''al fresco''.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=301}} Some colours were however based on pigments which were ruined if applied on a wet surface, and were thus applied in a second stage on the dry wall, or ''a secco''. Paints thus applied included shades of green (pigments based on [[copper]] or [[malachite]]), [[ultramarine]] (pigments made from [[lapis lazuli]], used rarely in Swedish church murals) and red (pigments based on [[cinnabar]]).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=301\u2013302}} Other pigments found in church murals from the 12th and 13th centuries are [[green earth]], [[atacamite]], [[Lead(II,IV) oxide|minium]], [[massicot]] and [[azurite]],{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2010|p=51}}{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=336}} though common and simple pigments dominate.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=340}} Decorating a Romanesque church with murals was nonetheless a costly undertaking due to the expensive materials used as pigments.{{sfn|Nilsson|2015|p=139}} In addition, Romanesque murals were sometimes augmented by lightly sculpted elements: [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] of saints could be sculpted in [[stucco]] and [[gilding|gilded]], or decorated with small balls of white paint intended to mimic [[pearl]]s. Sometimes gilded copper plates were also attached to highlight certain elements. It's also possible that some murals were decorated with [[rock crystal]]s.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=302}} Throughout the Middle Ages, lime was used as binding medium for the paint, but occasionally [[casein]], [[erucic acid]] and [[drying oil]]s were used.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=56\u201357}}\n\nFrom {{circa}} 1200 the technique partially changed. Instead of working on a smooth layer of plaster, the painters now painted directly on a rougher, more uneven layer of plaster. Some elements were still painted ''affresco'' but painting ''a secco'' dominated.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=316}} Contours were carved into the wet surface instead of painted, as before. Towards the end of the Middle Ages, the technique changed again: now the contours were typically drawn using charcoal or sometimes a pigment based on [[iron oxide]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=317}} After the outlines had been made, the paints were applied, and lastly text (in the form of [[speech scroll]]s) and [[stencil]]ed details and patterns put in place.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=338}} The palette of pigments expanded and changed as the Middle Ages progressed.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=336}} [[Albertus Pictor]], working at the end of the 15th and early 16th century, for example used [[lead-tin-yellow]], [[orpiment]] and [[Naples yellow]] in addition to pigments already mentioned.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2018|p=95}} His workshop furthermore imported several pigments, probably from Germany.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2018|p=98}} Albertus Pictor also used [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazes]] on some details.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=338}}\n\nMany of these colours have faded or changed over time.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=317}}{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=338\u2013339}} Some light, lead-based pigments tend to oxidize into darker [[plattnerite]] when painted, as was the rule, on lime background (but not when painted on wood).{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=338}} Similarly, cinnabar red has occasionally turned into [[metacinnabar]]. In addition, organic pigments such as [[brazilin]] have faded by exposure to sunlight.{{sfn|Nord|Tronner|2011|p=338}} In the Romanesque murals, the pigments used in painting ''a secco'' \u2013 typically details, such as eyes, and the most vibrant colours \u2013 have not been absorbed by the underlying material as well, and thus have a tendency to come off more easily, leaving only the ''affresco'' layer of the mural visible. This is particularly true in cases where the paintings have been covered with whitewash at a later date. If and when the whitewash is removed, the ''a secco'' layer often also falls off.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=303}}\n\n==Artists==\n[[File:Albertus Pictor selfportrait cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Self-portrait by Albertus Pictor in Lid Church]]\nThe technical execution as well as the iconography indicate that the artists who made the Romanesque murals were well educated.{{sfn|Nilsson|2015|p=139}} Overall, however, very little is known about the artists and workshops who made the earliest murals in Swedish churches.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=310}} A few murals from the 13th century are signed, two in [[rune]]s ({{ill|D\u00e4desj\u00f6 Old Church|sv|D\u00e4desj\u00f6 gamla kyrka}}, by Sigmund, and [[Anga Church, Gotland|Anga Church]], by Halvard) and one in [[Letter_case#Majuscule|majuscles]] ({{ill|Veta Church|sv|Veta kyrka}} by Magnus).{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=331}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1951|p=46}} Nothing further is however known about these artist.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=310}} More detailed records about artists and workshops exist in some cases from the middle of the 15th century and onward. The names of several of these artists have been preserved, either by signatures and inscriptions in the churches, or preserved in city [[archive]]s such as those in [[Stockholm]] and [[Arboga]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=310}} [[Albertus Pictor]] is the most well-known of these Late Gothic artists, who acquired fame and a following already in his lifetime.{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=182}} His signature is known from six churches, and {{ill|Lid Church|sv|Lids kyrka}} also contains a self-portrait by him.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=313}} His name is also mentioned in the city archives of Stockholm.{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=183}} In other cases, where no written sources exist, art historians have assigned [[notname]]s to groups of works either assumed to have been made by the same workshop or more loosely, works showing certain stylistic relations with each other.{{sfn|Anund|Qvistr\u00f6m|2012|p=180}}\n\nThe artists who were active during the late Middle Ages typically worked in workshops consisting of a master and one or two [[journeyman|journeymen]] and/or [[apprentice]]s. They often operated from a city and decorated the churches in the vicinity. Apart from murals, their work probably also encompassed the painting of [[altarpiece]]s, textiles and other religious objects. Many of the artists seem to have done other kinds of artistic work as well; some are noted as [[glazier]] and carpenters, in addition to painters, in the archives.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=310}}\n\nThe murals were painted during the warm months of the year, typically between early April and mid-August. If the work couldn't be finished during the summer months, they were resumed the following spring.{{sfn|Lindgren|1996|p=310}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of church murals in Sweden]]\n*[[Church frescos in Denmark]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n*{{cite book |last1= Anund|first1= Johan|last2=Qvistr\u00f6m|first2=Linda|date= 2012|title= Det medeltida Uppland: en arkeologisk guidebok|trans-title= Medieval Uppland: an acrhaeological guide book|url= http://libris.kb.se/bib/12345707rn/mode/1up/|language= Swedish|location= Lund|publisher= Historiska Media|isbn=978-91-85873-74-6|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Augustsson|editor1-first=Jan-Erik|last= Lindgren|first= Mereth|date= 1996|title=Signums svenska konsthistoria.

The island of Taiwan has an area of {{convert|35808|km2|sp=us}}, with mountain ranges dominating the eastern two-thirds and plains in the western third, where its highly urbanised population is concentrated. [[Taipei]] is the capital and largest metropolitan area. Other major cities include [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taichung]], [[Tainan]] and [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]]. With 23.7&nbsp;million inhabitants, Taiwan is among the most densely populated states, and is the most populous state and largest [[gross domestic product|economy]] that is not a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN).\n\n[[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] settled the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] around 6,000 years ago. In the 17th century, [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]] opened the island to mass [[Han people|Han]] immigration. After the brief [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in parts of the southern and western areas of the island, the island [[Taiwan under Qing rule|was annexed in 1683]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895. Following the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], which had [[Xinhai Revolution|overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911]], [[Retrocession Day|took control of Taiwan]] on behalf of the [[World War II Allies]]. The resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]] led to the loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|flight of the ROC government to Taiwan]] in 1949. Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the [[Two Chinas|legitimate representative of China]], since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to [[free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and numerous smaller islands]]. In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation called the \"[[Taiwan Miracle]]\". In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the ROC transitioned from a one-party military dictatorship to a multi-party democracy with a [[semi-presidential system]].\n\nTaiwan's export-oriented industrial economy is the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)|21st-largest]] in the world, with major contributions from steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals manufacturing.

Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s transformed into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>\n[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]\nThe [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president.

Local governments are responsible or partially responsible for social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport and public safety.\n\nThere are three types of subnational divisions: special municipalities, cities and counties. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities which have government offices with elected leaders and local councils, which share responsibilities with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones. In addition, districts, cities and townships are further divided into villages and neighbourhoods.\n\n==Military==\n{{Main|Republic of China Armed Forces}}\n{{See also|Republic of China Military Academy}}\n\n[[File:Thunderbolt 2000 MLRS Side View 20111105a.jpg|thumb|[[Republic of China Army]] [[Thunderbolt-2000]]]]\nThe [[Republic of China Army]] takes its roots in the [[National Revolutionary Army]], which was established by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925 in [[Guangdong]] with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. When the [[People's Liberation Army]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]], much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nToday, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as a defence to the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] using the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] as a pretext. This law authorizes the use of military force when certain conditions are met, such as a danger to mainlanders.<ref name=2004NatDefRpt />\n\nFrom 1949 to the 1970s, the primary mission of the Taiwanese military was to \"retake mainland China\" through [[Project National Glory]].

[[Taipei]] is the capital and largest metropolitan area. Other major cities include [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taichung]], [[Tainan]] and [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]]. With 23.7&nbsp;million inhabitants, Taiwan is among the most densely populated states, and is the most populous state and largest [[gross domestic product|economy]] that is not a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN).\n\n[[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] settled the island of Taiwan around 6,000 years ago. In the 17th century, [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch rule]] opened the island to mass [[Han people|Han]] immigration. After the brief [[Kingdom of Tungning]] in parts of the southern and western areas of the island, the island [[Taiwan under Qing rule|was annexed in 1683]] by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and [[Treaty of Shimonoseki|ceded]] to the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1895. Following the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], which had [[Xinhai Revolution|overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911]], [[Retrocession Day|took control of Taiwan]] on behalf of the [[World War II Allies]]. The resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]] led to the loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|flight of the ROC government to Taiwan]] in 1949. Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the [[Two Chinas|legitimate representative of China]], since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to [[free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and numerous smaller islands]]. In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation called the \"[[Taiwan Miracle]]\".

[[List of islands of Taiwan|Smaller islands]] include a number in the Taiwan Strait including the [[Penghu]] archipelago, the [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] near the Chinese coast, and some of the [[South China Sea Islands]].\n\nThe main island is a tilted [[fault block]], characterized by the contrast between the eastern two-thirds, consisting mostly of five rugged mountain ranges parallel to the east coast, and the flat to gently rolling plains of the western third, where the majority of Taiwan's population reside. There are several peaks over 3,500&nbsp;m, the highest being [[Yu Shan]] at {{cvt|3952|m|ft}}, making Taiwan the world's [[List of islands by highest point|fourth-highest island]]. The tectonic boundary that formed these ranges is still active, and the island experiences many earthquakes, a few of them highly destructive.

The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]].

This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>\n[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]\nThe [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president.

The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratic reforms and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.<ref name=\"power-shift\">{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179\u2013183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}</ref> The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.<ref name=\"panblue-reunif-chineseid\" /> The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

Local governments are responsible or partially responsible for social services, education, urban planning, public construction, water management, environmental protection, transport and public safety.\n\nThere are three types of subnational divisions: special municipalities, cities and counties. Special municipalities and cities are further divided into districts for local administration. Counties are further divided into townships and county-administered cities which have government offices with elected leaders and local councils, which share responsibilities with the county. Some divisions are indigenous divisions which have different degrees of autonomy to standard ones. In addition, districts, cities and townships are further divided into villages and neighbourhoods.\n\n==Military==\n{{Main|Republic of China Armed Forces}}\n{{See also|Republic of China Military Academy}}\n\n[[File:Thunderbolt 2000 MLRS Side View 20111105a.jpg|thumb|[[Republic of China Army]] [[Thunderbolt-2000]]]]\nThe [[Republic of China Army]] takes its roots in the [[National Revolutionary Army]], which was established by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925 in [[Guangdong]] with a goal of reunifying China under the Kuomintang. When the [[People's Liberation Army]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]], much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nToday, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as a defence to the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] using the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] as a pretext. This law authorizes the use of military force when certain conditions are met, such as a danger to mainlanders.<ref name=2004NatDefRpt />\n\nFrom 1949 to the 1970s, the primary mission of the Taiwanese military was to \"retake mainland China\" through [[Project National Glory]].

In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese [[multiculturalism]] has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan.<ref>{{harvnb|Hsiau|2005|pp=125\u2013129}}; {{harvnb|Winckler|1994|pp=23\u201341}}</ref> [[Identity politics]], along with the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has led to distinct traditions in many areas, including [[Taiwanese cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Music of Taiwan|music]].\n\n[[File:2008TIBE Day1 Hall1 Opening TouhWang.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Wang Tuoh]], a Taiwanese writer, literary critic and politician]]\nOne of Taiwan's greatest attractions is the [[National Palace Museum]], which houses more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and porcelain and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art and objects in the world.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557357_9/Museum.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028163715/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557357_9/Museum.html|title=Museum|archivedate=28 October 2009|work=archive.org}}</ref> The KMT moved this collection from the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War.

[[Karaoke]], drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms according to the number of guests in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to form all-encompassing and elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV's, equipped not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.\n\nTaiwan has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government agencies such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation fines, and credit card payments.<ref>{{cite journal|author=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |authorlink=American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei |title=Convenience Stores Aim at Differentiation |journal=Taiwan Business Topics |volume=34 |issue=11 |url=http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&vol_num=11&topics_id=558 |format=\u2013 <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AConvenience+Stores+Aim+at+Differentiation&as_publication=Taiwan+Business+TOPICS&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |ref=harv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516161020/http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&vol_num=11&topics_id=558 |archivedate=16 May 2008 }}</ref> They also provide a service for mailing packages.\n\nTaiwanese culture has also influenced other cultures.
