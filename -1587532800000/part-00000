Released on 20 October [[Bollywood films of 1995|1995]], the film stars [[Shah Rukh Khan]] and [[Kajol]]. The plot revolves around Raj and Simran, two young [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|non-resident Indians]], who fall in love during a vacation through Europe with their friends. Raj tries to win over Simran's family so the couple can marry, but Simran's father has long since promised her hand to his friend's son.

It won 10 [[Filmfare Awards]]\u2014the most for a single film at that time\u2014and the [[National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment]]. Its soundtrack album became one of the most popular of the 1990s.\n\nMany critics praised the film, which connected with different segments of society by simultaneously promoting strong family values and the following of one's own heart. Its success led other film makers to target the non-resident Indian audience, which was deemed more lucrative for them. It spawned many imitations of its story and style, and homages to specific scenes. ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' was one of only three Hindi films in the reference book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]'', and was placed twelfth on the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of top Indian films of all time. It is the longest-running film in the history of [[Indian cinema]]. As of 2019, over 20 years after its first release, it is still being shown at the [[Maratha Mandir]] theatre in [[Mumbai]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/25/asia/india-bollywood-ddlj/index.html |title=Bollywood's longest-running movie gets big screen reprieve |last=Shah |first=Khushbu |date=25 February 2015 |website=[[CNN]] |access-date=20 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please do not expand the plot, it must be under 700 words -->\nRaj Malhotra ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) and Simran Singh ([[Kajol]]) are non-resident Indians (NRI) living in [[London]]. Simran was raised by her strict and conservative father, Baldev Singh ([[Amrish Puri]]), while Raj's father Dharamvir Malhotra ([[Anupam Kher]]) is very liberal. Simran always dreams of meeting her ideal man; her mother Lajjo ([[Farida Jalal]]) warns her against this, saying dreams are good, but one should not blindly believe they come true. One day, Baldev receives a letter from his friend Ajit ([[Satish Shah]]), who lives in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[India]]. Ajit wants to keep a promise he and Baldev made to each other 20 years ago\u2014to have Simran marry his son Kuljeet ([[Parmeet Sethi]]). Simran is disappointed, as she does not want to marry someone whom she has never met.\n\nOne evening, Raj enters Baldev's shop after closing time to buy beer. Baldev refuses, but Raj grabs a case of beer, throws money on the counter, and runs away. An infuriated Baldev calls Raj a disgrace to India. Meanwhile, Raj's father agrees to his request to go on a train trip across Europe with his friends, and Simran's friends have invited her to go on the same trip. Simran asks her father to let her see the world before her marriage, and he reluctantly agrees.\n\nOn the trip, Raj and Simran meet. Raj constantly flirts with Simran, much to her irritation. The two miss their train to [[Zurich]] and are separated from their friends, but start to travel together and become friends. Raj falls in love with Simran on the journey, and when they part ways in London, Simran realises she is in love with him as well. At home, Simran tells her mother about the boy she met on her trip; Baldev overhears the conversation and becomes enraged with his daughter. He says the family will move to India the next day. Meanwhile, Raj tells his father about Simran and that she will soon get married. When Raj says he believes Simran loves him too, his father encourages him to go after her.\n\nIn India, Baldev is reunited with his relatives and his friend, Ajit. A miserable Simran and her younger sister Chutki ([[Pooja Ruparel]]) take an instant dislike to Simran's fianc\u00e9 Kuljeet because of his arrogance. Simran pines for Raj, but her mother tells her to forget him because she knows Baldev will never accept their relationship. The next morning, Raj arrives outside of the house where Simran is staying and the two reunite. She begs him to elope with her, but Raj refuses and says he will only marry her with her father's consent. Raj befriends Kuljeet and is quickly accepted by both families. Later, his father arrives in India and also becomes friends with Simran's and Kuljeet's families. Eventually, Lajjo and Chutki discover that Raj is the boy Simran fell in love with in Europe. Lajjo also tells Raj and Simran to run away, but he still refuses. Baldev recognises Raj from the beer incident but eventually accepts him. However, after he discovers a photograph of Raj and Simran together in Europe, he slaps and humiliates Raj and tells him to leave.\n\nAs Raj and his father wait at the railway station, Kuljeet, who is angry to learn of Raj's love for Simran, arrives with his friends and attack them. Eventually, Baldev and Ajit arrive and stop the fight, and Raj boards the departing train with his father. Simran then arrives with her mother and sister; she tries to join Raj on the train, but Baldev stops her. Simran begs him to let her go, saying she cannot live without Raj. Baldev, realising nobody loves his daughter more than Raj does, lets her go, and she runs and catches the train as it departs.\n\n== Cast ==\nCredits adapted from [[British Film Institute]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7e63fe2b |title=Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) BFI |year=2002 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601000634/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b7e63fe2b |archive-date=1 June 2015 |access-date=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n<!-- ORDERING AS PER THE OPENING CREDITS OF THE FILM -->\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Raj Malhotra\n* [[Kajol]] as Simran Singh\n* [[Amrish Puri]] as Chaudhary Baldev Singh, Simran's father\n* [[Farida Jalal]] as Lajwanti \"Lajjo\" Singh, Simran's mother\n* [[Satish Shah]] as Ajit Singh, Baldev's friend in India\n* [[Achala Sachdev]] as Simran's grandmother\n* [[Himani Shivpuri]] as Kammo Kaur, Simran's aunt\n* [[Pooja Ruparel]] as Rajeshwari \"Chutki\" Singh, Simran's sister\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Dharamvir Malhotra, Raj's father\n* [[Parmeet Sethi]] as Kuljeet Singh, Ajit's son\n* [[Mandira Bedi]] as Preeti Singh, Ajit's daughter\n* [[Anaita Shroff Adajania]] as Sheena, Simran's friend\n* [[Karan Johar]] and Arjun Sablok as Raj's friends Rocky and Robbie\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Origin and scripting ===\n[[Aditya Chopra]] assisted his father, director and producer [[Yash Chopra]], during the making of ''[[Chandni]]'' (1989), ''[[Lamhe]]'' (1991) and ''[[Darr]]'' (1993).<ref name=adi /> During this time, Aditya wrote several of his own scripts, including one he assumed would be his first film, but eventually became his second, ''[[Mohabbatein]]'' (2000).<ref name=Shahrukh /> For three years, he worked on the story that would become ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' before approaching his father to direct it.

Composers Jatin and Lalit Pandit were given only 10 days to complete the background score, and the first copies were printed on 30 September.{{sfn|Chopra|2002|pp=46\u201348}} After filming was complete, Aditya decided to make a Hollywood-style documentary of the film-making process, which had not been done before in India. Karan Johar and Uday were put in charge because they had already been recording some of the process. On 18 October, two days before the film's release, the 30-minute special ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, The Making'' was broadcast on television by [[Doordarshan]].<ref name=\"Bookmyshow\" />{{sfn|Chopra|2002|pp=46\u201348}}\n\n== Themes ==\n''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' repeats the usual conservative agenda of family, courtship and marriage, but it proposes that Indian family values are portable assets that can be upheld regardless of country of residence.{{sfn|Uberoi|1997|pp=305, 333}} To prove this, Raj, an NRI who was brought up in London, is portrayed as the story's \"good guy\", whereas Kuljeet, raised in India, is portrayed as the villain. This is a reversal of the roles in typical Indian films, which usually portray Indians as being morally superior to Westerners.{{sfn|Ganti|2004|p=42}} Here, NRIs are validated as potential model Indian citizens.{{sfn|Mehta|2011|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nThe story aims to capture the struggle between traditional family values and the modern value of individualism.{{sfn|Virdi|2003|p=208}} Although Raj and Simran want to be together regardless of her father's plans for her, Raj tries to win over his girlfriend's father rather than simply eloping with her. In this and other Indian stories, family values are ultimately considered more important than the romantic plot. Moral values and rules of conduct take precedence over individual desires.{{sfn|Dengel-Janic|Eckstein|2008|p=51}} The film implies that \"Indianness\" can be defined by the importance of family life; whether at home or abroad, it is the Indian family system that is recognised as the social institution that most defines Indian identity.{{sfn|Punathambekar|2005|p=160}}\n\nIn ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'', the purity/sanctity of women is being related to that of the nation. In the scene after Raj and Simran spend the night together, and Simran is concerned that something happened, Raj tells her: \"You think I am beyond values, but I am a Hindustani, and I know what a Hindustani girl's ''[[Izzat (honour)|izzat]]'' (honour) is worth. Trust me, nothing happened last night.\" This speaks to the Indian diaspora and their need to try and sustain their value system,{{sfn|Punathambekar|2005|p=158}} and the man's responsibility to protect the Indian woman's sexual purity.{{sfn|Virdi|2003|p=197}} In ''The Routledge Encyclopedia of Films'', Ranjani Mazumdar says the film has a running theme of unfulfilled desires, which is exemplified by Raj's father telling him to enjoy life because his own was a struggle, and Simran's mother telling her to run away with Raj because she was unable to live her own dreams.{{sfn|Mazumdar|2014|p=207}}\n\nScott Jordan Harris, writing for [[Roger Ebert]]'s website, says the film's popularity lies in its ability to effectively convey two opposing themes appealing to different portions of society. He said, \"It argues that we should follow our hearts and chase happiness wherever it leads, regardless of the obstacles in our paths, while simultaneously suggesting we should respect the ways of our elders, particularly our parents, and do nothing that challenges their will\".<ref name=ebert /> Rachel Dwyer said the film was important for presenting marriage as an understanding between parents and children. While fighting the old tradition of the arranged marriage, it still encouraged the importance of seeking parental consent, even for a love marriage.{{sfn|Dwyer|2014|p=160}} According to Patricia Uberoi, ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' reiterates the theme of ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!]]'' (1994){{efn|Uberoi states the theme to be that the lovers were willing to sacrifice their own feelings for their families.{{sfn|Uberoi|1997|p=309}}}} in a self-conscious manner while also linking it explicitly to the fact that the protagonists tend to remind themselves and each other of what it means to be an Indian.{{sfn|Uberoi|1997|p=309}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Jatin Lalit]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = 1995\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = {{flatlist|\n*[[Bollywood music]]\n*[[Soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n}}\n| length       = 38:46\n| label        = [[HMV]]\n| producer     = [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]]\n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n}}\n\nThe ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' soundtrack features seven songs composed by [[Jatin Lalit]], a duo consisting of the brothers Jatin and Lalit Pandit.

Released on 20 October [[Bollywood films of 1995|1995]], the film stars [[Shah Rukh Khan]] and [[Kajol]]. The plot revolves around Raj and Simran, two young [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|non-resident Indians]], who fall in love during a vacation through Europe with their friends. Raj tries to win over Simran's family so the couple can marry, but Simran's father has long since promised her hand to his friend's son.

It won 10 [[Filmfare Awards]]\u2014the most for a single film at that time\u2014and the [[National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment]]. Its soundtrack album became one of the most popular of the 1990s.\n\nMany critics praised the film, which connected with different segments of society by simultaneously promoting strong family values and the following of one's own heart. Its success led other film makers to target the non-resident Indian audience, which was deemed more lucrative for them. It spawned many imitations of its story and style, and homages to specific scenes. ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' was one of only three Hindi films in the reference book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]'', and was placed twelfth on the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of top Indian films of all time. It is the longest-running film in the history of [[Indian cinema]]. As of 2019, over 20 years after its first release, it is still being shown at the [[Maratha Mandir]] theatre in [[Mumbai]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/25/asia/india-bollywood-ddlj/index.html |title=Bollywood's longest-running movie gets big screen reprieve |last=Shah |first=Khushbu |date=25 February 2015 |website=[[CNN]] |access-date=20 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Please do not expand the plot, it must be under 700 words -->\nRaj Malhotra ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) and Simran Singh ([[Kajol]]) are non-resident Indians (NRI) living in [[London]]. Simran was raised by her strict and conservative father, Baldev Singh ([[Amrish Puri]]), while Raj's father Dharamvir Malhotra ([[Anupam Kher]]) is very liberal. Simran always dreams of meeting her ideal man; her mother Lajjo ([[Farida Jalal]]) warns her against this, saying dreams are good, but one should not blindly believe they come true. One day, Baldev receives a letter from his friend Ajit ([[Satish Shah]]), who lives in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[India]]. Ajit wants to keep a promise he and Baldev made to each other 20 years ago\u2014to have Simran marry his son Kuljeet ([[Parmeet Sethi]]). Simran is disappointed, as she does not want to marry someone whom she has never met.\n\nOne evening, Raj enters Baldev's shop after closing time to buy beer. Baldev refuses, but Raj grabs a case of beer, throws money on the counter, and runs away. An infuriated Baldev calls Raj a disgrace to India. Meanwhile, Raj's father agrees to his request to go on a train trip across Europe with his friends, and Simran's friends have invited her to go on the same trip. Simran asks her father to let her see the world before her marriage, and he reluctantly agrees.\n\nOn the trip, Raj and Simran meet. Raj constantly flirts with Simran, much to her irritation. The two miss their train to [[Zurich]] and are separated from their friends, but start to travel together and become friends. Raj falls in love with Simran on the journey, and when they part ways in London, Simran realises she is in love with him as well. At home, Simran tells her mother about the boy she met on her trip; Baldev overhears the conversation and becomes enraged with his daughter. He says the family will move to India the next day. Meanwhile, Raj tells his father about Simran and that she will soon get married. When Raj says he believes Simran loves him too, his father encourages him to go after her.\n\nIn India, Baldev is reunited with his relatives and his friend, Ajit. A miserable Simran and her younger sister Chutki ([[Pooja Ruparel]]) take an instant dislike to Simran's fianc\u00e9 Kuljeet because of his arrogance. Simran pines for Raj, but her mother tells her to forget him because she knows Baldev will never accept their relationship. The next morning, Raj arrives outside of the house where Simran is staying and the two reunite. She begs him to elope with her, but Raj refuses and says he will only marry her with her father's consent. Raj befriends Kuljeet and is quickly accepted by both families. Later, his father arrives in India and also becomes friends with Simran's and Kuljeet's families. Eventually, Lajjo and Chutki discover that Raj is the boy Simran fell in love with in Europe. Lajjo also tells Raj and Simran to run away, but he still refuses. Baldev recognises Raj from the beer incident but eventually accepts him. However, after he discovers a photograph of Raj and Simran together in Europe, he slaps and humiliates Raj and tells him to leave.\n\nAs Raj and his father wait at the railway station, Kuljeet, who is angry to learn of Raj's love for Simran, arrives with his friends and attack them. Eventually, Baldev and Ajit arrive and stop the fight, and Raj boards the departing train with his father. Simran then arrives with her mother and sister; she tries to join Raj on the train, but Baldev stops her. Simran begs him to let her go, saying she cannot live without Raj. Baldev, realising nobody loves his daughter more than Raj does, lets her go, and she runs and catches the train as it departs.\n\n== Cast ==\nCredits adapted from [[British Film Institute]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7e63fe2b |title=Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) BFI |year=2002 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601000634/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b7e63fe2b |archive-date=1 June 2015 |access-date=25 June 2015}}</ref>\n<!-- ORDERING AS PER THE OPENING CREDITS OF THE FILM -->\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Raj Malhotra\n* [[Kajol]] as Simran Singh\n* [[Amrish Puri]] as Chaudhary Baldev Singh, Simran's father\n* [[Farida Jalal]] as Lajwanti \"Lajjo\" Singh, Simran's mother\n* [[Satish Shah]] as Ajit Singh, Baldev's friend in India\n* [[Achala Sachdev]] as Simran's grandmother\n* [[Himani Shivpuri]] as Kammo Kaur, Simran's aunt\n* [[Pooja Ruparel]] as Rajeshwari \"Chutki\" Singh, Simran's sister\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Dharamvir Malhotra, Raj's father\n* [[Parmeet Sethi]] as Kuljeet Singh, Ajit's son\n* [[Mandira Bedi]] as Preeti Singh, Ajit's daughter\n* [[Anaita Shroff Adajania]] as Sheena, Simran's friend\n* [[Karan Johar]] and Arjun Sablok as Raj's friends Rocky and Robbie\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Origin and scripting ===\n[[Aditya Chopra]] assisted his father, director and producer [[Yash Chopra]], during the making of ''[[Chandni]]'' (1989), ''[[Lamhe]]'' (1991) and ''[[Darr]]'' (1993).<ref name=adi /> During this time, Aditya wrote several of his own scripts, including one he assumed would be his first film, but eventually became his second, ''[[Mohabbatein]]'' (2000).<ref name=Shahrukh /> For three years, he worked on the story that would become ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' before approaching his father to direct it.

He then became excited about the possibility of directing the film himself. After his mother, the playback singer [[Pamela Chopra]], agreed that the idea was sound, he decided to make this his directorial debut.{{sfn|Chopra|2002|pp=31\u201332}} Aditya wanted to make a wholesome film that people could watch repeatedly. He wanted to diverge from the typical plot line of the time, in which lovers run away when their parents object, and show that if their love was strong enough, the parents would eventually understand.<ref name=filmf />\n\nIn May 1994, Aditya read the first draft of the script to several members of the [[Yash Raj Films]] production team assigned to work with him, including a cinematographer, an art director and a dialogue writer.

Composers Jatin and Lalit Pandit were given only 10 days to complete the background score, and the first copies were printed on 30 September.{{sfn|Chopra|2002|pp=46\u201348}} After filming was complete, Aditya decided to make a Hollywood-style documentary of the film-making process, which had not been done before in India. Karan Johar and Uday were put in charge because they had already been recording some of the process. On 18 October, two days before the film's release, the 30-minute special ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, The Making'' was broadcast on television by [[Doordarshan]].<ref name=\"Bookmyshow\" />{{sfn|Chopra|2002|pp=46\u201348}}\n\n== Themes ==\n''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' repeats the usual conservative agenda of family, courtship and marriage, but it proposes that Indian family values are portable assets that can be upheld regardless of country of residence.{{sfn|Uberoi|1997|pp=305, 333}} To prove this, Raj, an NRI who was brought up in London, is portrayed as the story's \"good guy\", whereas Kuljeet, raised in India, is portrayed as the villain. This is a reversal of the roles in typical Indian films, which usually portray Indians as being morally superior to Westerners.{{sfn|Ganti|2004|p=42}} Here, NRIs are validated as potential model Indian citizens.{{sfn|Mehta|2011|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nThe story aims to capture the struggle between traditional family values and the modern value of individualism.{{sfn|Virdi|2003|p=208}} Although Raj and Simran want to be together regardless of her father's plans for her, Raj tries to win over his girlfriend's father rather than simply eloping with her. In this and other Indian stories, family values are ultimately considered more important than the romantic plot. Moral values and rules of conduct take precedence over individual desires.{{sfn|Dengel-Janic|Eckstein|2008|p=51}} The film implies that \"Indianness\" can be defined by the importance of family life; whether at home or abroad, it is the Indian family system that is recognised as the social institution that most defines Indian identity.{{sfn|Punathambekar|2005|p=160}}\n\nIn ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'', the purity/sanctity of women is being related to that of the nation. In the scene after Raj and Simran spend the night together, and Simran is concerned that something happened, Raj tells her: \"You think I am beyond values, but I am a Hindustani, and I know what a Hindustani girl's ''[[Izzat (honour)|izzat]]'' (honour) is worth. Trust me, nothing happened last night.\" This speaks to the Indian diaspora and their need to try and sustain their value system,{{sfn|Punathambekar|2005|p=158}} and the man's responsibility to protect the Indian woman's sexual purity.{{sfn|Virdi|2003|p=197}} In ''The Routledge Encyclopedia of Films'', Ranjani Mazumdar says the film has a running theme of unfulfilled desires, which is exemplified by Raj's father telling him to enjoy life because his own was a struggle, and Simran's mother telling her to run away with Raj because she was unable to live her own dreams.{{sfn|Mazumdar|2014|p=207}}\n\nScott Jordan Harris, writing for [[Roger Ebert]]'s website, says the film's popularity lies in its ability to effectively convey two opposing themes appealing to different portions of society. He said, \"It argues that we should follow our hearts and chase happiness wherever it leads, regardless of the obstacles in our paths, while simultaneously suggesting we should respect the ways of our elders, particularly our parents, and do nothing that challenges their will\".<ref name=ebert /> Rachel Dwyer said the film was important for presenting marriage as an understanding between parents and children. While fighting the old tradition of the arranged marriage, it still encouraged the importance of seeking parental consent, even for a love marriage.{{sfn|Dwyer|2014|p=160}} According to Patricia Uberoi, ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' reiterates the theme of ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!]]'' (1994){{efn|Uberoi states the theme to be that the lovers were willing to sacrifice their own feelings for their families.{{sfn|Uberoi|1997|p=309}}}} in a self-conscious manner while also linking it explicitly to the fact that the protagonists tend to remind themselves and each other of what it means to be an Indian.{{sfn|Uberoi|1997|p=309}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Jatin Lalit]]\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = 1995\n| recorded     = \n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = {{flatlist|\n*[[Bollywood music]]\n*[[Soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n}}\n| length       = 38:46\n| label        = [[HMV]]\n| producer     = [[Jatin\u2013Lalit]]\n| prev_title   = \n| prev_year    = \n| next_title   = \n| next_year    = \n}}\n\nThe ''Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'' soundtrack features seven songs composed by [[Jatin Lalit]], a duo consisting of the brothers Jatin and Lalit Pandit.

He guided the plane until he was over an empty field and finally ejected at an altitude of only 500 feet. The plane glided down and landed nearly intact. An inspection revealed the issue to be a weak fuel pump component which explained the failure and previous crashes of 7 IAF and 16 French Mirages.

He did not want to eject and risk killing people in a village below, but he remembered the warning from the French manufacturers that should he attempt to land without power, the nose of the plane would slam against the ground, killing the pilot. He guided the plane until he was over an empty field and finally ejected at an altitude of only 500 feet. The plane glided down and landed nearly intact. An inspection revealed the issue to be a weak fuel pump component which explained the failure and previous crashes of 7 IAF and 16 French Mirages.

Since 1982 Campbell has worked with the specific physical and contextual properties of a given site, be it art gallery, museum, atrium, tower, radio airwaves or on the World Wide Web, in developing and presenting her works. Campbell studied film under Alan Cholodenko, Rex Butler and Keith Broadfoot at Power Dept of Art History, [[University of Sydney]] 1987.

Campbell also recognises the influence of French film semioticians Metz, Baudry, Bazin, [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]] and Bellour. In 1987 Campbell took a course in Super 8 at the [https://www.sydney.edu.au/architecture/about/tin-sheds-gallery.html Tin Sheds]Architecture Faculty, University of Sydney and conducted numerous workshops organised by Sydney Intermedia Network with artists/peers such as Andrew Frost<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrew-frost|title=Andrew Frost {{!}} The Guardian|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>, Anthony Foot, Nick Meyers.\n\n== Art mediums ==\nCampbell progressed from working in Super 8 medium and later discovered that video was a way of integrating other image sources into the performance frame. She used video to set up live video feedback so that the camera and the monitor could be used to create a dialogue between performer and audience. Campbell explored mediums that became domesticated and therefore accessible to the amateur artist.  She was particularly interested in organisations or artist-run initiatives using experimental media.\n\n== Early art performance installation ==\nCampbell used text as the starting point for her large-scale installation ''Conradania'', based on [[Joseph Conrad]]\u2019s acclaimed 1899 novel ''[[Heart of Darkness|The Heart of Darkness]]'' set on the Congo River in Africa.  [[Francis Ford Coppola]] based the film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' on Conrad's novel.\n\nWhen Campbell read ''Notes (1979)'' written by [[Eleanor Coppola]], the wife of Francis Ford Coppola, which records her observations of the making of the film, she noted that her daughter's reaction to the film set in the Philippines was like Jungle Cruise Disneyland.  \n\nIt is from this point of juxtaposition between the real and the unreal culture to another that Campbell began the solitary performative work of ''Conradania.'' \n\nCampbell spent eight weeks typing out ''The Heart of Darkness'' word for word on twenty 15&nbsp; ft lengths of Chinese rice paper. She then filmed the Jungle Cruise ride at Disneyland, which is played on a small screen in front of the hanging rice paper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://art.uts.edu.au/index.php/barbara-campbell/|title=Barbara Campbell \u00b7 UTS ART|website=art.uts.edu.au|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref> \n\n== Recent work ==\nCampbell incorporated video into her performances in galleries, museums, and festivals.

She was particularly interested in organisations or artist-run initiatives using experimental media.\n\n== Early art performance installation ==\nCampbell used text as the starting point for her large-scale installation ''Conradania'', based on [[Joseph Conrad]]\u2019s acclaimed 1899 novel ''[[Heart of Darkness|The Heart of Darkness]]'' set on the Congo River in Africa.  [[Francis Ford Coppola]] based the film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' on Conrad's novel.\n\nWhen Campbell read ''Notes (1979)'' written by [[Eleanor Coppola]], the wife of Francis Ford Coppola, which records her observations of the making of the film, she noted that her daughter's reaction to the film set in the Philippines was like Jungle Cruise Disneyland.  \n\nIt is from this point of juxtaposition between the real and the unreal culture to another that Campbell began the solitary performative work of ''Conradania.'' \n\nCampbell spent eight weeks typing out ''The Heart of Darkness'' word for word on twenty 15&nbsp; ft lengths of Chinese rice paper. She then filmed the Jungle Cruise ride at Disneyland, which is played on a small screen in front of the hanging rice paper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://art.uts.edu.au/index.php/barbara-campbell/|title=Barbara Campbell \u00b7 UTS ART|website=art.uts.edu.au|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref> ''(''[[Griffith University Art Collection]])\n\n== Recent work ==\nCampbell incorporated video into her performances in galleries, museums, and festivals.

One of the oldest records of what may have been an encounter with smallpox in Africa is associated with the [[Year of the Elephant|elephant war]] circa AD 568, when after fighting a siege in Mecca, Ethiopian troops contracted the disease which they carried with them back to Africa. Arab ports in Coastal towns in Africa likely contributed to the importation of smallpox into Africa, as early as the 13th century, though no records exist until the 16th century. Upon invasion of these towns by tribes in the interior of Africa, a severe epidemic affected all African inhabitants while sparing the Portuguese. Densely populated areas of Africa connected to the Mediterranean, Nubia and Ethiopia by caravan route likely were affected by smallpox since the 11th century, though written records do not appear until the introduction of the slave trade in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Fenner1\"/>\n\nThe [[enslavement]] of Africans continued to spread smallpox to the entire continent, with raiders pushing farther inland along caravan routes in search of people to enslave. The effects of smallpox could be seen along caravan routes, and those who were not affected along the routes were still likely to become infected either waiting to be put onboard or on board ships.<ref name=\"Fenner1\" />\n\nSmallpox in Angola was likely introduced shortly after Portuguese settlement of the area in 1484. The 1864 epidemic killed 25,000 inhabitants, one third of the total population in that same area. In 1713, an outbreak occurred in South Africa after a ship from India docked at Cape Town, bringing infected laundry ashore. Many of the settler [[Demographics of Europe|European]] population suffered, and whole clans of the [[Khoisan]] people were wiped out. A second outbreak occurred in 1755, again affecting both the [[white]] population and the Khoisan. The disease spread further, completely eradicating several Khosian clans, all the way to the Kalahari desert. A third outbreak in 1767 similarly affected the Khoisan and Bantu peoples. But the European [[Colony|colonial]] [[settlers]] were not affected nearly to the extent that they were in the first two outbreaks, it has been speculated this is because of [[variolation]]. Continued [[enslavement]] operations brought smallpox to Cape Town again in 1840, taking the lives of 2500 people, and then to Uganda in the 1840s. It is estimated that up to eighty percent of the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] tribe was exterminated by smallpox in 1831, and whole tribes were being wiped out in Kenya up until 1899. Along the Zaire river basin were areas where no one survived the epidemics, leaving the land devoid of human life. In Ethiopia and the Sudan, six epidemics are recorded for the 19th century: 1811\u20131813, 1838\u20131839, 1865\u20131866, 1878\u20131879, 1885\u20131887, and 1889\u20131890.<ref name=\"who\">Fenner, Frank, Donald A.

In populations of railroad and migrant workers who traveled from city to city the disease had reached an endemic low boil.  This fact did not bother the government at the time, nor did it spur them to action.  Despite the general acceptance of the [[germ theory of disease]], pioneered by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] in 1849, smallpox was still thought to be mostly a malady that followed the less-distinct guidelines of a \"filth\" disease, and therefore would only affect the \"lower classes\".<ref>Willrich, Michael (2011).

London, England: The Penguin Press p. 15-30</ref>\n\nThe last major smallpox epidemic in the United States occurred in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] throughout a three-year period, between 1901-1903. During this three-year period, 1596 cases of the disease occurred throughout the city. Of those cases, nearly 300 people died.

These quarantine facilities, or pesthouses, were mostly located on Southampton Street. As the outbreak worsened, men were also moved to hospitals on [[Gallops Island|Gallop\u2019s Island]]. Women and children were primarily sent to Southampton Street.

In response to this belief, the city instructed teams of physicians to vaccinate anyone living in inexpensive housing.\n\nIn an effort to control the outbreak, the [[Boston Public Health Commission|Boston Board of Health]] began voluntary vaccination programs. Individuals could receive free vaccines at their\nwork places or at different stations set up throughout the city. By the end 1901, some 40,000 of the city\u2019s residents had received a smallpox vaccine. However, despite the city's efforts, the epidemic continued to grow. In January 1902, a door-to-door vaccination program was initiated. Health officials were instructed to compel individuals to receive vaccination, pay a $5 fine, or be faced with 15 days in prison. This door-to-door program was met by some resistance as some individuals feared the vaccines to be unsafe and ineffective. Others felt compulsory vaccination in itself was a problem that violated an individual's civil liberties.\n\nThis program of compulsory vaccination eventually led to the famous [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]] case. The case was the result of a [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] resident's refusal to be vaccinated. Henning Jacobsen, a Swedish immigrant, refused vaccination out of fear it would cause him illness. He claimed a previous smallpox vaccine had made him sick as a child. Rather than pay the five dollar fine, he challenged the state's authority on forcing people to receive vaccination. His case was lost at the state level, but Jacobson appealed the ruling, and so, the case was taken up by the Supreme Court. In 1905 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld the Massachusetts law: it was ruled Jacobson could not refuse the mandatory vaccination.<ref name=\"nejm.org\"/>\n\nIn Canada, between 1702 and 1703, nearly a quarter of the population of Quebec city died due to a smallpox epidemic.<ref name=\"who\" />\n\n==Pacific epidemics==\n\n===Island South East Asia===\nThere is evidence that smallpox reached the [[Philippine islands]] from the 4th century onwards \u2013 linked possibly to [[History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia|contact between South East Asians and Indian traders]].<ref name=\"king\">Victor T.

Campbell also noted that there was no evidence of Aborigines ever having been exposed to the variolous matter, merely speculation that they may have been.

Thought to have been discovered by accident, it became known that those who contracted smallpox through a break in the skin in which smallpox matter was inserted received a less severe reaction than those who contracted it naturally. This realization led to the practice of purposely infecting people with matter from smallpox scabs in order to protect them later from a more severe reaction. This practice, known today as [[variolation]], was first practiced in China in the 10th century.<ref name=\"who\" /> Methods of carrying out the procedure varied depending upon location. Variolation was the sole method of protection against smallpox other than quarantine until Jenner's discovery of the inoculating abilities of [[cowpox]] against the smallpox virus in 1796. Efforts to protect populations against smallpox by way of vaccination followed for centuries after Jenner's discovery. Smallpox has since been completely eradicated since 1979, because of the mass vaccination efforts of the World Health Organization.\n\n===Variolation===\n{{Main|Variolation}}\nThe word variolation is synonymous with inoculation, insertion, en-grafting, or transplantation.

Scabs from smallpox victims who had the disease in its mild form would be selected, and the powder was kept close to body temperature by means of keeping it close to the chest, killing the majority of the virus and resulting in a more mild case of smallpox.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> Scabs were generally used when a month old, but could be used more quickly in hot weather (15\u201320 days), and slower in winter (50 days). The process was carried out by taking eight smallpox scabs and crushing them in a mortar with two grains of ''[[Uvularia grandiflora]]'' in a mortar.<ref name=\"who\" /> The powder was administered nasally through a silver tube that was curved at its point, through the right nostril for boys and the left nostril for girls.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> A week after the procedure, those variolated would start to produce symptoms of smallpox, and recovery was guaranteed. In India, where the European colonizers came across variolation in the 17th century, a large, sharp needle was dipped into the pus collected from mature smallpox sores. Several punctures with this needle were made either below the deltoid muscle or in the forehead, and then were covered with a paste made from boiled rice.<ref name=\"glynn\" />  Variolation spread farther from India to other countries in south west Asia, and then to the Balkans.<ref name=\"who\" />\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:Lady Mary Wortley Montagu with her son Edward by Jean Baptiste Vanmour.jpg|thumb|[[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] with her son, Edward Wortley Montagu, who was variolated in March, 1718 by Dr. Charles Maitland<ref name=\"killer\" />]]\n\nIn 1713, [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]]'s brother died of smallpox; she too contracted the virus two years later at the age of twenty-six, leaving her badly scarred.<ref name=\"montagu\">{{cite journal |author1=Case Christine L |author2=Chung King Thom | year = 1997 | title = Montagu and Jenner: The Campaign Against Smallpox | url = | journal = SIM News | volume = 47 | issue = 2| pages = 58\u201360 }}</ref> When her husband was made ambassador to [[Ottoman Empire]], she accompanied him to Constantinople.

Several royal families had themselves variolated by English physicians claiming to be specialists. Recipients include the family of [[Louis XV]] following his own death of smallpox, and [[Catherine the Great]], whose husband had been horribly disfigured by the disease.<ref name=\"fire\" /><ref name=\"macnalty\" /> Catherine the Great was variolated by Thomas Dimsdale, who followed Sutton's method of inoculation.<ref name=\"glynn\" />\nIn France, the practice was sanctioned until an epidemic was traced back to an [[inoculation]].

The procedure involved scratching the arm with the tip of a knife, placing several [[smallpox]] scabs in the cuts and then bandaging the arm. After receiving the procedure, the children stayed in the barn for several weeks to recover. First symptoms occurred after one week and usually cleared up three days later. On average, it took a month to fully recover from the encounter with smallpox combined with weakness from the preceding starvation.<ref name=\"fire\" />\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Jenner was sent to study medicine in [[Chipping Sodbury]] with [[Daniel Ludlow]], a surgeon and apothecary, from 1762 to 1770<ref name=\"montagu\" /><ref name=\"country doctor\" /><ref name=\"UCLA\">The UCLA Louise M.

During his apprenticeship, Jenner heard that upon contracting [[cowpox]], the recipient became immune to smallpox for the remainder of their life.<ref name=\"montagu\" /><ref name=\"macnalty\" /> However, this theory was dismissed because of several cases proving that the opposite was true.\n\nAfter learning all he could from Ludlow, Jenner apprenticed with [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] in London from 1770\u20131773.<ref name=\"montagu\" /><ref name=\"UCLA\" /> Hunter was a correspondent of Ludlow\u2019s, and it is likely that Ludlow recommended Jenner to apprentice with Hunter. Hunter believed in deviating from the accepted treatment and trying new methods if the traditional methods failed. This was considered unconventional medicine for the time period and had a pivotal role in Jenner's development as a scientist.<ref name=\"fire\" /><ref name=\"allan\">{{cite journal | author = Wells Lloyd Allan | year = 1999 | title = Why Not Try the Experiment?\" The Scientific Education of Edward Jenner | url = | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 108\u2013110 | pmid = 11615678 }}</ref>\n\nAfter two years of apprenticeship, Jenner moved back to his hometown of [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]] in Gloucestershire,<ref name=\"UCLA\" /> where he quickly gained the respect of both his patients and other medical professionals for his work as a physician.<ref name=\"fire\" /> It was during this time that Jenner revisited the connection between cowpox and smallpox.<ref name=\"montagu\" /> He began investigating dairy farms in the Gloucestershire area looking for cowpox. This research was slow going as Jenner often had to wait months or even years before cases of cowpox would again return to the Gloucestershire area.<ref name=\"fire\" /> During his study, he found that cowpox was actually several diseases that were similar in nature but were distinguishable through slight differences, and that not all versions had the capacity to make one immune from smallpox upon contraction.<ref name=\"montagu\" />\n\nThrough his study, he incorrectly deduced that smallpox and cowpox were all the same disease, simply manifesting themselves differently in different animals, eventually setting back his research and making it difficult to publish his findings. Though Jenner had seen cases of people becoming immune to smallpox after having cowpox, too many exceptions of people still contracting smallpox after having had cowpox were arising. Jenner was missing crucial information which he later discovered in 1796.<ref name=\"fire\" /> Jenner hypothesized that in order to become immune to smallpox using cowpox, the matter from the cowpox pustules must be administered at maximum potency; else it was too weak to be effective in creating immunity to smallpox. He deduced that cowpox was most likely to transfer immunity from smallpox if administered at the eighth day of the disease.<ref name=\"montagu\" />\n\nOn May 14, 1796, he performed an experiment in which he took pus from a sore of a cowpox-infected milkmaid named Sarah Nelmes, and applied it to a few small scratches on the arm of an eight-year-old boy who had never before contracted either smallpox or cowpox, named [[James Phipps]]. Phipps recovered as expected.<ref name=\"montagu\" /> Two months later, Jenner repeated the procedure using matter from smallpox, observing no effect. Phipps became the first person to become immune to smallpox without ever actually having the disease. He was variolated many more times over the course of his life to prove his immunity.<ref name=\"fire\" />\n\nWhen the next cowpox epidemic broke out in 1798, Jenner conducted a series of inoculations using cowpox, all of them successful<ref name=\"montagu\" /> except on his own son Robert.<ref name=\"fire\" /> Because his findings were revolutionary and lacked in evidence, the [[Royal Society]] (of which Jenner was a member) refused to publish his findings.<ref name=\"fire\" /> Jenner then rode to London and had his book ''An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variol\u00e6 Vaccin\u00e6'' published by Sampson Low\u2019s firm<ref name=\"country doctor\" /> in June 1798.<ref name=\"french\">{{cite journal | author = Meynell Elinor | year = 1995 | title = French Reactions to Jenner's Discovery of Smallpox Vaccination: The Primary Sources | doi = 10.1093/shm/8.2.285 | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 285\u2013303| pmid=11639810}}</ref> The book was an instant bestseller among the elite in London salons, in the medical establishment and among the ladies and gentlemen of the enlightenment.<ref name=\"fire\" />\n\nKnowledge of the ability of cowpox to provide immunity from smallpox was present in England before Jenner's discovery. In 1774, a cattle dealer named [[Benjamin Jesty]] had successfully inoculated his wife and three sons using cowpox. This was before Jenner discovered the immunization capabilities of cowpox.<ref name=\"macnalty\" /> However, Jesty simply performed the procedure; he did not take the discovery any further by inoculating his family with smallpox matter to see if there would be a reaction or perform any other trials.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> Jenner was the first to prove the effectiveness of vaccination with cowpox using scientific experimentation.<ref name=\"fire\" />\n\n====United States of America====\n[[Benjamin Franklin]], who had lost his own son to smallpox in 1736, made the suggestion to create a pamphlet to distribute to families explaining how to inoculate their children themselves, so as to eliminate cost as the factor in the decision to choose to inoculate children. [[William Heberden]], a friend of Franklin's and an English physician, followed through with Franklin's idea, printing 2000 pamphlets in 1759 which were distributed by Franklin in America.<ref name=\"glynn\" />\n\nAn American physician, [[John Kirkpatrick (physician)|John Kirkpatrick]], upon his visit to London in 1743, told of an instance where variolation stopped an epidemic in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in 1738,<ref name=\"kirkpatrick\">McCandless, Peter. ''Slavery, Disease, and Suffering in the Southern Lowcountry.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011</ref> where 800 people were inoculated and only eight deaths occurred.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> His account of the success of variolation in Charleston helped to play a role in the revival of its practice in London. Kirkpatrick also advocated inoculating patients with matter from the sores of another inoculated person, instead of using matter from the sore of a smallpox victim, a procedure that Maitland had been using since 1722.<ref name=\"killer\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n\n* {{cite book |author=Clendening, Logan|chapter=Chapter XXVII.

One of the oldest records of what may have been an encounter with smallpox in Africa is associated with the [[Year of the Elephant|elephant war]] circa AD 568, when after fighting a siege in Mecca, Ethiopian troops contracted the disease which they carried with them back to Africa. Arab ports in Coastal towns in Africa likely contributed to the importation of smallpox into Africa, as early as the 13th century, though no records exist until the 16th century. Upon invasion of these towns by tribes in the interior of Africa, a severe epidemic affected all African inhabitants while sparing the Portuguese. Densely populated areas of Africa connected to the Mediterranean, Nubia and Ethiopia by caravan route likely were affected by smallpox since the 11th century, though written records do not appear until the introduction of the slave trade in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Fenner1\"/>\n\nThe [[enslavement]] of Africans continued to spread smallpox to the entire continent, with raiders pushing farther inland along caravan routes in search of people to enslave. The effects of smallpox could be seen along caravan routes, and those who were not affected along the routes were still likely to become infected either waiting to be put onboard or on board ships.<ref name=\"Fenner1\" />\n\nSmallpox in Angola was likely introduced shortly after Portuguese settlement of the area in 1484. The 1864 epidemic killed 25,000 inhabitants, one third of the total population in that same area. In 1713, an outbreak occurred in South Africa after a ship from India docked at Cape Town, bringing infected laundry ashore. Many of the settler [[Demographics of Europe|European]] population suffered, and whole clans of the [[Khoisan]] people were wiped out. A second outbreak occurred in 1755, again affecting both the [[white]] population and the Khoisan. The disease spread further, completely eradicating several Khosian clans, all the way to the Kalahari desert. A third outbreak in 1767 similarly affected the Khoisan and Bantu peoples. But the European [[Colony|colonial]] [[settlers]] were not affected nearly to the extent that they were in the first two outbreaks, it has been speculated this is because of [[variolation]]. Continued [[enslavement]] operations brought smallpox to Cape Town again in 1840, taking the lives of 2500 people, and then to Uganda in the 1840s. It is estimated that up to eighty percent of the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] tribe was exterminated by smallpox in 1831, and whole tribes were being wiped out in Kenya up until 1899. Along the Zaire river basin were areas where no one survived the epidemics, leaving the land devoid of human life. In Ethiopia and the Sudan, six epidemics are recorded for the 19th century: 1811\u20131813, 1838\u20131839, 1865\u20131866, 1878\u20131879, 1885\u20131887, and 1889\u20131890.<ref name=\"who\">Fenner, Frank, Donald A.

In populations of railroad and migrant workers who traveled from city to city the disease had reached an endemic low boil.  This fact did not bother the government at the time, nor did it spur them to action.  Despite the general acceptance of the [[germ theory of disease]], pioneered by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] in 1849, smallpox was still thought to be mostly a malady that followed the less-distinct guidelines of a \"filth\" disease, and therefore would only affect the \"lower classes\".<ref>Willrich, Michael (2011).

London, England: The Penguin Press p. 15-30</ref>\n\nThe last major smallpox epidemic in the United States occurred in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] throughout a three-year period, between 1901-1903. During this three-year period, 1596 cases of the disease occurred throughout the city. Of those cases, nearly 300 people died. As a whole, the epidemic had a 17% fatality rate.<ref name=\"nejm.org\">{{cite journal|last1=Albert|first1=Michael R.|last2=Ostheimer|first2=Kristen G.|last3=Breman|first3=Joel G.|title=The Last Smallpox Epidemic in Boston and the Vaccination Controversy, 1901\u20131903|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=February 1, 2001|volume=344|issue=5|doi=10.1056/NEJM200102013440511|pages=375\u2013379|pmid=11172172}}</ref>\n\nThose who were infected with the disease were detained in quarantine facilities in the hopes of protecting others from getting sick. These quarantine facilities, or pesthouses, were mostly located on Southampton Street. As the outbreak worsened, men were also moved to hospitals on [[Gallops Island|Gallop\u2019s Island]]. Women and children were primarily sent to Southampton Street. Smallpox patients were not allowed in regular hospital facilities throughout the city, for fear the sickness would spread among the already sick.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Albert|first1=Michael R.|last2=Ostheimer|first2=Kristen G.|last3=Liewehr|first3=David J.|last4=Steinberg|first4=Seth M.|last5=Breman|first5=Joel G.|title=Smallpox Manifestations and Survival during the Boston Epidemic of 1901 to 1903|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=December 17, 2002|volume=137|issue=12|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-137-12-200212170-00013|pmid=12484715|pages=993\u20131000|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nA reflection of the previous outbreak that occurred in New York, the poor and homeless were blamed for the sickness's spread. In response to this belief, the city instructed teams of physicians to vaccinate anyone living in inexpensive housing.\n\nIn an effort to control the outbreak, the [[Boston Public Health Commission|Boston Board of Health]] began voluntary vaccination programs. Individuals could receive free vaccines at their\nwork places or at different stations set up throughout the city. By the end 1901, some 40,000 of the city\u2019s residents had received a smallpox vaccine. However, despite the city's efforts, the epidemic continued to grow. In January 1902, a door-to-door vaccination program was initiated. Health officials were instructed to compel individuals to receive vaccination, pay a $5 fine, or be faced with 15 days in prison. This door-to-door program was met by some resistance as some individuals feared the vaccines to be unsafe and ineffective. Others felt compulsory vaccination in itself was a problem that violated an individual's civil liberties.\n\nThis program of compulsory vaccination eventually led to the famous [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]] case. The case was the result of a [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] resident's refusal to be vaccinated. Henning Jacobsen, a Swedish immigrant, refused vaccination out of fear it would cause him illness. He claimed a previous smallpox vaccine had made him sick as a child. Rather than pay the five dollar fine, he challenged the state's authority on forcing people to receive vaccination. His case was lost at the state level, but Jacobson appealed the ruling, and so, the case was taken up by the Supreme Court. In 1905 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld the Massachusetts law: it was ruled Jacobson could not refuse the mandatory vaccination.<ref name=\"nejm.org\"/>\n\nIn Canada, between 1702 and 1703, nearly a quarter of the population of Quebec city died due to a smallpox epidemic.<ref name=\"who\" />\n\n==Pacific epidemics==\n\n===Island South East Asia===\nThere is evidence that smallpox reached the [[Philippine islands]] from the 4th century onwards \u2013 linked possibly to [[History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia|contact between South East Asians and Indian traders]].<ref name=\"king\">Victor T.

Thought to have been discovered by accident, it became known that those who contracted smallpox through a break in the skin in which smallpox matter was inserted received a less severe reaction than those who contracted it naturally. This realization led to the practice of purposely infecting people with matter from smallpox scabs in order to protect them later from a more severe reaction. This practice, known today as [[variolation]], was first practiced in China in the 10th century.<ref name=\"who\" /> Methods of carrying out the procedure varied depending upon location. Variolation was the sole method of protection against smallpox other than quarantine until Jenner's discovery of the inoculating abilities of [[cowpox]] against the smallpox virus in 1796. Efforts to protect populations against smallpox by way of vaccination followed for centuries after Jenner's discovery. Smallpox has since been completely eradicated since 1979, because of the mass vaccination efforts of the World Health Organization.\n\n===Variolation===\n{{Main|Variolation}}\nThe word variolation is synonymous with inoculation, insertion, en-grafting, or transplantation.

Scabs from smallpox victims who had the disease in its mild form would be selected, and the powder was kept close to body temperature by means of keeping it close to the chest, killing the majority of the virus and resulting in a more mild case of smallpox.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> Scabs were generally used when a month old, but could be used more quickly in hot weather (15\u201320 days), and slower in winter (50 days).

In India, where the European colonizers came across variolation in the 17th century, a large, sharp needle was dipped into the pus collected from mature smallpox sores.

This greatly weakened the children before the actual procedure was given.<ref name=\"glynn\" /><ref name=\"country doctor\">{{cite journal | author = Bailey Ian | year = 1996 | title = Edward Jenner (1749\u20131823): Naturalist, Scientist, Country Doctor, Benefactor to Mankind | url = | journal = Journal of Medical Biography | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 63\u201370 | pmid = 11616266 | doi = 10.1177/096777209600400201 }}</ref> Jenner's own inoculation was administered by a Mr. Holbrow, an apothecary. The procedure involved scratching the arm with the tip of a knife, placing several [[smallpox]] scabs in the cuts and then bandaging the arm. After receiving the procedure, the children stayed in the barn for several weeks to recover. First symptoms occurred after one week and usually cleared up three days later. On average, it took a month to fully recover from the encounter with smallpox combined with weakness from the preceding starvation.<ref name=\"fire\" />\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Jenner was sent to study medicine in [[Chipping Sodbury]] with [[Daniel Ludlow]], a surgeon and apothecary, from 1762 to 1770<ref name=\"montagu\" /><ref name=\"country doctor\" /><ref name=\"UCLA\">The UCLA Louise M.

During his apprenticeship, Jenner heard that upon contracting [[cowpox]], the recipient became immune to smallpox for the remainder of their life.<ref name=\"montagu\" /><ref name=\"macnalty\" /> However, this theory was dismissed because of several cases proving that the opposite was true.\n\nAfter learning all he could from Ludlow, Jenner apprenticed with [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] in London from 1770\u20131773.<ref name=\"montagu\" /><ref name=\"UCLA\" /> Hunter was a correspondent of Ludlow\u2019s, and it is likely that Ludlow recommended Jenner to apprentice with Hunter. Hunter believed in deviating from the accepted treatment and trying new methods if the traditional methods failed. This was considered unconventional medicine for the time period and had a pivotal role in Jenner's development as a scientist.<ref name=\"fire\" /><ref name=\"allan\">{{cite journal | author = Wells Lloyd Allan | year = 1999 | title = Why Not Try the Experiment?\" The Scientific Education of Edward Jenner | url = | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 108\u2013110 | pmid = 11615678 }}</ref>\n\nAfter two years of apprenticeship, Jenner moved back to his hometown of [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]] in Gloucestershire,<ref name=\"UCLA\" /> where he quickly gained the respect of both his patients and other medical professionals for his work as a physician.<ref name=\"fire\" /> It was during this time that Jenner revisited the connection between cowpox and smallpox.<ref name=\"montagu\" /> He began investigating dairy farms in the Gloucestershire area looking for cowpox. This research was slow going as Jenner often had to wait months or even years before cases of cowpox would again return to the Gloucestershire area.<ref name=\"fire\" /> During his study, he found that cowpox was actually several diseases that were similar in nature but were distinguishable through slight differences, and that not all versions had the capacity to make one immune from smallpox upon contraction.<ref name=\"montagu\" />\n\nThrough his study, he incorrectly deduced that smallpox and cowpox were all the same disease, simply manifesting themselves differently in different animals, eventually setting back his research and making it difficult to publish his findings. Though Jenner had seen cases of people becoming immune to smallpox after having cowpox, too many exceptions of people still contracting smallpox after having had cowpox were arising. Jenner was missing crucial information which he later discovered in 1796.<ref name=\"fire\" /> Jenner hypothesized that in order to become immune to smallpox using cowpox, the matter from the cowpox pustules must be administered at maximum potency; else it was too weak to be effective in creating immunity to smallpox. He deduced that cowpox was most likely to transfer immunity from smallpox if administered at the eighth day of the disease.<ref name=\"montagu\" />\n\nOn May 14, 1796, he performed an experiment in which he took pus from a sore of a cowpox-infected milkmaid named Sarah Nelmes, and applied it to a few small scratches on the arm of an eight-year-old boy who had never before contracted either smallpox or cowpox, named [[James Phipps]]. Phipps recovered as expected.<ref name=\"montagu\" /> Two months later, Jenner repeated the procedure using matter from smallpox, observing no effect. Phipps became the first person to become immune to smallpox without ever actually having the disease. He was variolated many more times over the course of his life to prove his immunity.<ref name=\"fire\" />\n\nWhen the next cowpox epidemic broke out in 1798, Jenner conducted a series of inoculations using cowpox, all of them successful<ref name=\"montagu\" /> except on his own son Robert.<ref name=\"fire\" /> Because his findings were revolutionary and lacked in evidence, the [[Royal Society]] (of which Jenner was a member) refused to publish his findings.<ref name=\"fire\" /> Jenner then rode to London and had his book ''An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variol\u00e6 Vaccin\u00e6'' published by Sampson Low\u2019s firm<ref name=\"country doctor\" /> in June 1798.<ref name=\"french\">{{cite journal | author = Meynell Elinor | year = 1995 | title = French Reactions to Jenner's Discovery of Smallpox Vaccination: The Primary Sources | doi = 10.1093/shm/8.2.285 | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 285\u2013303| pmid=11639810}}</ref> The book was an instant bestseller among the elite in London salons, in the medical establishment and among the ladies and gentlemen of the enlightenment.<ref name=\"fire\" />\n\nKnowledge of the ability of cowpox to provide immunity from smallpox was present in England before Jenner's discovery. In 1774, a cattle dealer named [[Benjamin Jesty]] had successfully inoculated his wife and three sons using cowpox. This was before Jenner discovered the immunization capabilities of cowpox.<ref name=\"macnalty\" /> However, Jesty simply performed the procedure; he did not take the discovery any further by inoculating his family with smallpox matter to see if there would be a reaction or perform any other trials.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> Jenner was the first to prove the effectiveness of vaccination with cowpox using scientific experimentation.<ref name=\"fire\" />\n\n====United States of America====\n[[Benjamin Franklin]], who had lost his own son to smallpox in 1736, made the suggestion to create a pamphlet to distribute to families explaining how to inoculate their children themselves, so as to eliminate cost as the factor in the decision to choose to inoculate children. [[William Heberden]], a friend of Franklin's and an English physician, followed through with Franklin's idea, printing 2000 pamphlets in 1759 which were distributed by Franklin in America.<ref name=\"glynn\" />\n\nAn American physician, [[John Kirkpatrick (physician)|John Kirkpatrick]], upon his visit to London in 1743, told of an instance where variolation stopped an epidemic in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in 1738,<ref name=\"kirkpatrick\">McCandless, Peter. ''Slavery, Disease, and Suffering in the Southern Lowcountry.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011</ref> where 800 people were inoculated and only eight deaths occurred.<ref name=\"glynn\" /> His account of the success of variolation in Charleston helped to play a role in the revival of its practice in London. Kirkpatrick also advocated inoculating patients with matter from the sores of another inoculated person, instead of using matter from the sore of a smallpox victim, a procedure that Maitland had been using since 1722.<ref name=\"killer\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n\n* {{cite book |author=Clendening, Logan|chapter=Chapter XXVII.

The sexes are very similar in color and size. Corvids have strong, stout bills and large wingspans. The family includes the largest members of the [[passerine]] order.\n\nThe smallest corvid is the [[dwarf jay]] (''Aphelocoma nana''), at {{convert|41|g|oz|abbr=on}} and {{convert|21.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The largest corvids are the [[common raven]] (''Corvus corax'') and the [[thick-billed raven]] (''Corvus crassirostris''), both of which regularly exceed {{convert|1400|g|lb|abbr=off}} and {{convert|65|cm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nSpecies can be identified based on size, shape, and geography; however, some, especially the [[Australian crow]]s, are best identified by their raucous calls.<ref name = robertson2000 />\n\n==Ecology==\nCorvids occur in most climatic zones. Most are sedentary and do not [[bird migration|migrate]] significantly. However, during a shortage of food, irruptive migration can occur.<ref name = robertson2000 /> When species are migratory, they will form large flocks in the fall (around August in the Northern Hemisphere) and travel south.<ref name = shadesfonight />\n\nOne reason for the success of crows, compared to ravens, is their ability to overlap breeding territory. During breeding season, crows were shown to overlap breeding territory six times as much as ravens. This invasion of breeding ranges allowed a related increase in local population density.<ref name = m&n2006 />\n\nSince crows and magpies have benefited and even increased in numbers due to human development, it was suggested that this might cause increased rates of nest predation of smaller bird species, leading to declines. Several studies have shown this concern to be unfounded. One study examined [[American crow]]s, which had increased in numbers, were a suspect in nest predation of threatened [[marbled murrelet]]s. However, Steller's jays, which are successful independently of human development, are more efficient in plundering small birds' nests than [[American crow]]s and [[common raven]]s. Therefore, the human relationship with crows and ravens did not significantly increase nest predation, compared to other factors such as [[habitat destruction]].<ref name = m&n2006 /> Similarly a study examining the decline of British songbirds found no link between [[Eurasian magpie]] numbers and population changes of 23 songbird species.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=D.

Jackdaws, for example, have a strong social hierarchy, and are facultatively colonial during breeding.<ref name = v&s2004/> Providing mutual aid has also been recorded within many of the corvid species.\n\nYoung corvids have been known to [[Play (activity)|play]] and take part in elaborate social [[game]]s. Documented group games follow \"king of the mountain\", or \"follow the leader\", patterns. Other play involves the manipulation, passing, and balancing of sticks. Corvids also take part in other activities, such as sliding down smooth surfaces. These games are understood to play a large role in the adaptive and survival ability of the birds.<ref name=Gill/>\n\nMate selection is quite complex and accompanied with much social play in the Corvidae. Youngsters of social corvid species undergo a series of tests, including aerobatic feats, before being accepted as a mate by the opposite sex.<ref name = shadesfonight />\n\nSome corvids can be aggressive. [[Blue jay]]s, for example, are well known to attack anything that threatens their nest. Crows have been known to attack dogs, cats, ravens, and birds of prey. Most of the time these assaults take place as a distraction long enough to allow an opportunity for stealing food.<ref name = shadesfonight />\n\n===Food and feeding===\n[[File:Raven scavenging on a dead shark.jpg|thumb|right|Corvids are highly opportunistic foragers. Here a [[jungle crow]] feeds on a shark carcass.]]\nThe natural diet of many corvid species is omnivorous, consisting of [[invertebrate]]s, nestlings, small mammals, berries, fruits, seeds, and [[carrion]]. However, some corvids, especially the crows, have adapted well to human conditions and have come to rely on anthropogenic foods. In a US study of [[American crow]]s, [[common raven]]s and [[Steller's jay]]s around campgrounds and human settlements, the crows appeared to have the most diverse diet of all, taking [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] foods such as bread, spaghetti, fried potatoes, dog food, sandwiches, and livestock feed. The increase in available [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] food sources is contributing to population increase in some corvid species.<ref name = m&n2006/>\n\nSome corvids are predators of other birds. During the wintering months, corvids typically form foraging flocks.<ref name = robertson2000 /> However, some crows also eat many agricultural pests including cutworms, wireworms, grasshoppers, and harmful weeds.<ref name = shadesfonight>Shades of Night: [http://www.shades-of-night.com/aviary/ The Aviary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415190544/http://www.shades-of-night.com/aviary/ |date=15 April 2006 }}. Version of 2004-JUL-21. Retrieved 2007-NOV-10.</ref> Some corvids will eat carrion, and since they lack a specialized beak for tearing into flesh, they must wait until animals are opened, whether by other predators or as roadkill.\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Perisoreus canadensis feeding at nest.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Canada jay]] pair feeding their chicks. ]]\nMany species of corvid are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]], protecting territories throughout the year or simply during the breeding season. In some cases territories may only be guarded during the day, with the pair joining off-territory roosts at night. Some corvids are well-known communal roosters. Some groups of roosting corvids can be very large, with a roost of 65,000 [[Rook (bird)|rooks]] counted in Scotland.<ref name=Patterson/> Some, including the rook and the [[jackdaw]], are also communal nesters.\n\nThe partner bond in corvids is extremely strong and even lifelong in some species. This monogamous lifestyle, however, can still contain extra-pair copulations.<ref name=Li/> Males and females build large nests together in trees or on ledges; jackdaws are known to breed in buildings and in rabbit warrens.<ref name=\"v&s2004\" /> The male will also feed the female during incubation.<ref>[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]: [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026450 Corvidae]. Free subscription required.</ref> The nests are constructed of a mass of bulky twigs lined with grass and bark. Corvids can lay between 3 and 10 eggs, typically ranging between 4 and 7. The eggs are usually greenish in colour with brown blotches. Once hatched, the young remain in the nests for up to 6\u201310 weeks depending on the species.\n\nCorvids use several different forms of parental care, including biparental care and cooperative breeding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cockburn|first=Andrew|date=2006-06-07|title=Prevalence of different modes of parental care in birds|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=273|issue=1592|pages=1375\u20131383|doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3458|pmc=1560291|pmid=16777726}}</ref> [[Cooperative breeding]] takes place when parents are helped in raising their offspring, usually by relatives but also sometimes by non-related adults.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bourke|first=Andrew F.

By remaining with the parents, the young have more opportunities to learn necessary skills.\n\nWhen compared to dogs and cats in an experiment testing the ability to seek out food according to three-dimensional clues, corvids out-performed the mammals.<ref name=Krushinskii/> A [[meta-analysis]] testing how often birds invented new ways to acquire food in the wild found corvids to be the most innovative birds.<ref>Rincon, Paul (22 February 2005) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4286965.stm Crows and jays top bird IQ scale]. BBC.</ref> A 2004 review suggests that their cognitive abilities are on par with those of great apes.<ref name=Emery/> Despite structural differences, the brains of corvids and great apes both evolved the ability to make geometrical measurements.\n\nCorvid ingenuity is represented through their feeding skills, memorization abilities, use of tools, and group behaviour. Living in large social groups has long been connected with high cognitive ability. To live in a large group, a member must be able to recognize individuals and track the social position and foraging of other members over time. Members must also be able to distinguish between sex, age, reproductive status, and dominance, and to update this information constantly. It might be that social complexity corresponds to their high cognition.<ref name=Bond/>\n\nThe [[Eurasian magpie]] is the only non-mammal species known to be able to recognize itself in a [[mirror test]].<ref name=prior2008/> Magpies have been observed taking part in elaborate grieving rituals, which have been likened to human [[funeral]]s, including laying grass wreaths.<ref name=\"74.220.204.222\">[http://74.220.204.222/Puplando/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/EMOSPA47.pdf Animal emotions, wild justice and why they matter: Grieving magpies, a pissy baboon, and empathic elephants] Emotion, Space and Society xxx (2009) 1\u20134, Marc Bekoff</ref> Marc Bekoff, at the University of Colorado, argues that it shows that they are capable of feeling complex emotions, including [[grief]].<ref name=\"74.220.204.222\"/>\n\nThere are also specific examples of corvid cleverness.

Corvids have been recorded to recall their food's hiding place up to nine months later. It is suggested that vertical landmarks (like trees) are used to remember locations. There has also been evidence that [[California scrub jay]]s, which store perishable foods, not only remember where they stored their food, but for how long. This has been compared to [[episodic memory]], previously thought unique to humans.<ref name = claytonemery2005 />\n\n[[New Caledonian crow]]s (''Corvus moneduloides'') are notable for their highly developed tool fabrication. They make angling tools of twigs and leaves trimmed into hooks, then use the hooks to pull insect larvae from tree holes. Tools are engineered according to task and apparently also to learned preference.

Some Native Americans, such as the [[Haida people|Haida]], believed that a raven created the earth and despite being a trickster spirit, ravens were popular on totems, credited with creating man, and considered responsible for placing the Sun in the sky. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nDue to their [[carrion]] diet, the [[Celts|Celtic]] peoples strongly associated corvids with war, death and the battlefield \u2013 their great intelligence meant that they were often considered messengers, or manifestations of the gods such [[Bendigeidfran]] ''Blessed raven'' or the Irish [[Morrigan]], [[otherworld|underworld deities]] that may be related to the later Arthurian [[Fisher King]]. The Welsh ''[[Dream of Rhonabwy]]'' illustrates well the association of ravens with war. In many parts of Britain, gatherings of crows, or more often magpies, are counted using the [[augury|divination rhyme]]: ''one for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told.'' Another rhyme is: ''one for sorrow, two for mirth, three for a funeral, four for a birth, five for heaven, six for hell, and seven for the Devil, his own sel'.'' Cornish superstition holds that when a lone magpie is encountered, it must be loudly greeted with respect.\n\nVarious [[Germanic peoples]] highly revered the raven. The major deity [[Odin]] was so associated with ravens throughout history that he gained the [[kenning]] \"raven god\"{{efn|e.g. [[Icelandic (language)|Icelandic]]: ''hrafnagu\u00f0'', as per the ''[[Gylfaginning]]''.}} and the [[raven banner]] was the flag of various [[Viking Age]] Scandinavian chieftains. He was also attended by [[Hugin and Munin]], two [[Common raven|ravens]] who whispered news into his ears.<ref name=Chappell/> The [[Valravn]] sometimes appears in modern Scandinavian folklore. The [[Sutton Hoo]] treasure features stylised corvids with scrolled beaks in the decorative enamel work on the shield and purse lid reflecting their common [[totemic]] status to the Anglo-Saxons, whose pre-Christian [[Woden|indigenous beliefs]] were of the same origin as that of the aforementioned Vikings.\n\nThe 6th century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] scribe [[Aesop]] featured corvids as intelligent antagonists in many fables. Later, in western literature, popularized by American poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s work \"[[The Raven]]\", the [[common raven]] becomes a symbol of the main character's descent into madness.\n\nThe book ''[[Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH]]'' and its film adaptation features a crow named Jeremy.\n\n[[File:Corvus hawaiiensis FWS.jpg|thumb|The [[Hawaiian crow]] is [[extinct in the wild]] as a result of [[habitat loss]] and other factors.]]\n\n===Status and conservation===\nUnlike many other bird [[family (biology)|families]], corvid [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] and reproduction, especially with many crows, has increased due to human development. The survival and reproductive success of certain crows and ravens is assisted by their close relationship with humans.<ref name = m&n2006 />\n\nHuman development provides additional resources by clearing land, creating shrublands rich in berries and insects. When the cleared land naturally replenishes, jays and crows use the young dense trees for nesting sites. Ravens typically use larger trees in denser forest.<ref name = m&n2006 />\n\nDespite the fact that most corvids are not threatened (many even increasing due to human activity) a few species are in danger. For example, the destruction of the Southeast Asian rainforest is endangering [[mixed-species feeding flock]]s with members from the family Corvidae.<ref name=Lee/> Also, since its [[semiarid]] scrubland [[habitat]] is an endangered [[ecosystem]], the [[Florida scrub jay]] has a small and declining population.<ref name=BLI/><ref name=Breininger/> A number of island species, which are more vulnerable to [[introduced species]] and habitat loss, have been driven to extinction, such as the [[New Zealand raven]], or are threatened, like the [[Mariana crow]].\n\nThe [[American crow]] population of the United States has grown over the years.

In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy|Sibley and Ahlquist]] united the corvids with other taxa in the [[Corvida]], based on [[DNA\u2013DNA hybridization]]. The presumed corvid relatives included [[currawong]]s, [[birds of paradise]], [[whipbird]]s, [[quail-thrush]]es, [[Pachycephalidae|whistlers]], [[monarch flycatcher]]s and [[drongo]]s, [[shrike]]s, [[vireo]]s, and [[vanga]]s,<ref name = robertson2000/> but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial. The corvids constitute the core group of the [[Corvoidea]], together with their closest relatives (the birds of paradise, [[Australian mud-nesters]], and shrikes).

The sexes are very similar in color and size. Corvids have strong, stout bills and large wingspans. The family includes the largest members of the [[passerine]] order.\n\nThe smallest corvid is the [[dwarf jay]] (''Aphelocoma nana''), at {{convert|41|g|oz|abbr=on}} and {{convert|21.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The largest corvids are the [[common raven]] (''Corvus corax'') and the [[thick-billed raven]] (''Corvus crassirostris''), both of which regularly exceed {{convert|1400|g|lb|abbr=off}} and {{convert|65|cm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nSpecies can be identified based on size, shape, and geography; however, some, especially the [[Australian crow]]s, are best identified by their raucous calls.<ref name = robertson2000 />\n\n==Ecology==\nCorvids occur in most climatic zones. Most are sedentary and do not [[bird migration|migrate]] significantly. However, during a shortage of food, irruptive migration can occur.<ref name = robertson2000 /> When species are migratory, they will form large flocks in the fall (around August in the Northern Hemisphere) and travel south.<ref name = shadesfonight />\n\nOne reason for the success of crows, compared to ravens, is their ability to overlap breeding territory. During breeding season, crows were shown to overlap breeding territory six times as much as ravens. This invasion of breeding ranges allowed a related increase in local population density.<ref name = m&n2006 />\n\nSince crows and magpies have benefited and even increased in numbers due to human development, it was suggested that this might cause increased rates of nest predation of smaller bird species, leading to declines. Several studies have shown this concern to be unfounded. One study examined [[American crow]]s, which had increased in numbers, were a suspect in nest predation of threatened [[marbled murrelet]]s. However, Steller's jays, which are successful independently of human development, are more efficient in plundering small birds' nests than [[American crow]]s and [[common raven]]s. Therefore, the human relationship with crows and ravens did not significantly increase nest predation, compared to other factors such as [[habitat destruction]].<ref name = m&n2006 /> Similarly a study examining the decline of British songbirds found no link between [[Eurasian magpie]] numbers and population changes of 23 songbird species.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=D.

Jackdaws, for example, have a strong social hierarchy, and are facultatively colonial during breeding.<ref name = v&s2004/> Providing mutual aid has also been recorded within many of the corvid species.\n\nYoung corvids have been known to [[Play (activity)|play]] and take part in elaborate social [[game]]s. Documented group games follow \"king of the mountain\", or \"follow the leader\", patterns. Other play involves the manipulation, passing, and balancing of sticks. Corvids also take part in other activities, such as sliding down smooth surfaces. These games are understood to play a large role in the adaptive and survival ability of the birds.<ref name=Gill/>\n\nMate selection is quite complex and accompanied with much social play in the Corvidae. Youngsters of social corvid species undergo a series of tests, including aerobatic feats, before being accepted as a mate by the opposite sex.<ref name = shadesfonight />\n\nSome corvids can be aggressive. [[Blue jay]]s, for example, are well known to attack anything that threatens their nest. Crows have been known to attack dogs, cats, ravens, and birds of prey. Most of the time these assaults take place as a distraction long enough to allow an opportunity for stealing food.<ref name = shadesfonight />\n\n===Food and feeding===\n[[File:Raven scavenging on a dead shark.jpg|thumb|right|Corvids are highly opportunistic foragers. Here a [[jungle crow]] feeds on a shark carcass.]]\nThe natural diet of many corvid species is omnivorous, consisting of [[invertebrate]]s, nestlings, small mammals, berries, fruits, seeds, and [[carrion]]. However, some corvids, especially the crows, have adapted well to human conditions and have come to rely on anthropogenic foods. In a US study of [[American crow]]s, [[common raven]]s and [[Steller's jay]]s around campgrounds and human settlements, the crows appeared to have the most diverse diet of all, taking [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] foods such as bread, spaghetti, fried potatoes, dog food, sandwiches, and livestock feed. The increase in available [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] food sources is contributing to population increase in some corvid species.<ref name = m&n2006/>\n\nSome corvids are predators of other birds. During the wintering months, corvids typically form foraging flocks.<ref name = robertson2000 /> However, some crows also eat many agricultural pests including cutworms, wireworms, grasshoppers, and harmful weeds.<ref name = shadesfonight>Shades of Night: [http://www.shades-of-night.com/aviary/ The Aviary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415190544/http://www.shades-of-night.com/aviary/ |date=15 April 2006 }}. Version of 2004-JUL-21.

In some cases territories may only be guarded during the day, with the pair joining off-territory roosts at night. Some corvids are well-known communal roosters. Some groups of roosting corvids can be very large, with a roost of 65,000 [[Rook (bird)|rooks]] counted in Scotland.<ref name=Patterson/> Some, including the rook and the [[jackdaw]], are also communal nesters.\n\nThe partner bond in corvids is extremely strong and even lifelong in some species. This monogamous lifestyle, however, can still contain extra-pair copulations.<ref name=Li/> Males and females build large nests together in trees or on ledges; jackdaws are known to breed in buildings and in rabbit warrens.<ref name=\"v&s2004\" /> The male will also feed the female during incubation.<ref>[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]: [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026450 Corvidae]. Free subscription required.</ref> The nests are constructed of a mass of bulky twigs lined with grass and bark. Corvids can lay between 3 and 10 eggs, typically ranging between 4 and 7. The eggs are usually greenish in colour with brown blotches. Once hatched, the young remain in the nests for up to 6\u201310 weeks depending on the species.\n\nCorvids use several different forms of parental care, including biparental care and cooperative breeding.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cockburn|first=Andrew|date=2006-06-07|title=Prevalence of different modes of parental care in birds|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=273|issue=1592|pages=1375\u20131383|doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3458|pmc=1560291|pmid=16777726}}</ref> [[Cooperative breeding]] takes place when parents are helped in raising their offspring, usually by relatives but also sometimes by non-related adults.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bourke|first=Andrew F.

Living in large social groups has long been connected with high cognitive ability. To live in a large group, a member must be able to recognize individuals and track the social position and foraging of other members over time. Members must also be able to distinguish between sex, age, reproductive status, and dominance, and to update this information constantly. It might be that social complexity corresponds to their high cognition.<ref name=Bond/>\n\nThe [[Eurasian magpie]] is the only non-mammal species known to be able to recognize itself in a [[mirror test]].<ref name=prior2008/> Magpies have been observed taking part in elaborate grieving rituals, which have been likened to human [[funeral]]s, including laying grass wreaths.<ref name=\"74.220.204.222\">[http://74.220.204.222/Puplando/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/EMOSPA47.pdf Animal emotions, wild justice and why they matter: Grieving magpies, a pissy baboon, and empathic elephants] Emotion, Space and Society xxx (2009) 1\u20134, Marc Bekoff</ref> Marc Bekoff, at the University of Colorado, argues that it shows that they are capable of feeling complex emotions, including [[grief]].<ref name=\"74.220.204.222\"/>\n\nThere are also specific examples of corvid cleverness.

Corvids have been recorded to recall their food's hiding place up to nine months later. It is suggested that vertical landmarks (like trees) are used to remember locations. There has also been evidence that [[California scrub jay]]s, which store perishable foods, not only remember where they stored their food, but for how long. This has been compared to [[episodic memory]], previously thought unique to humans.<ref name = claytonemery2005 />\n\n[[New Caledonian crow]]s (''Corvus moneduloides'') are notable for their highly developed tool fabrication. They make angling tools of twigs and leaves trimmed into hooks, then use the hooks to pull insect larvae from tree holes.

One of the first signs that West Nile virus first arrived in the US in 1999 was the death of crows in New York.<ref name = Eidsonetal>{{cite journal |pmid=11585521 |year=2001 |last1=Eidson |first1=M |last2=Komar |first2=N |last3=Sorhage |first3=F |last4=Nelson |first4=R |last5=Talbot |first5=T |last6=Mostashari |first6=F |last7=McLean |first7=R |author8=West Nile Virus Avian Mortality Surveillance Group |title=Crow deaths as a sentinel surveillance system for West Nile virus in the northeastern United States, 1999 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=615\u201320 |pmc=2631775 |doi=10.3201/eid0704.010402 |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with humans==\nSeveral different corvids, particularly [[raven]]s, have occasionally served as [[pets]], although they are not able to speak as readily as [[parrot]]s and do not like being caged.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Role in myth and culture===\n{{See also|Cultural depictions of ravens}}\nFolklore often represents corvids as clever, and even mystical, animals. Some Native Americans, such as the [[Haida people|Haida]], believed that a raven created the earth and despite being a trickster spirit, ravens were popular on totems, credited with creating man, and considered responsible for placing the Sun in the sky. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nDue to their [[carrion]] diet, the [[Celts|Celtic]] peoples strongly associated corvids with war, death and the battlefield \u2013 their great intelligence meant that they were often considered messengers, or manifestations of the gods such [[Bendigeidfran]] ''Blessed raven'' or the Irish [[Morrigan]], [[otherworld|underworld deities]] that may be related to the later Arthurian [[Fisher King]]. The Welsh ''[[Dream of Rhonabwy]]'' illustrates well the association of ravens with war. In many parts of Britain, gatherings of crows, or more often magpies, are counted using the [[augury|divination rhyme]]: ''one for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told.'' Another rhyme is: ''one for sorrow, two for mirth, three for a funeral, four for a birth, five for heaven, six for hell, and seven for the Devil, his own sel'.'' Cornish superstition holds that when a lone magpie is encountered, it must be loudly greeted with respect.\n\nVarious [[Germanic peoples]] highly revered the raven. The major deity [[Odin]] was so associated with ravens throughout history that he gained the [[kenning]] \"raven god\"{{efn|e.g. [[Icelandic (language)|Icelandic]]: ''hrafnagu\u00f0'', as per the ''[[Gylfaginning]]''.}} and the [[raven banner]] was the flag of various [[Viking Age]] Scandinavian chieftains. He was also attended by [[Hugin and Munin]], two [[Common raven|ravens]] who whispered news into his ears.<ref name=Chappell/> The [[Valravn]] sometimes appears in modern Scandinavian folklore. The [[Sutton Hoo]] treasure features stylised corvids with scrolled beaks in the decorative enamel work on the shield and purse lid reflecting their common [[totemic]] status to the Anglo-Saxons, whose pre-Christian [[Woden|indigenous beliefs]] were of the same origin as that of the aforementioned Vikings.\n\nThe 6th century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] scribe [[Aesop]] featured corvids as intelligent antagonists in many fables. Later, in western literature, popularized by American poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s work \"[[The Raven]]\", the [[common raven]] becomes a symbol of the main character's descent into madness.\n\nThe book ''[[Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH]]'' and its film adaptation features a crow named Jeremy.\n\n[[File:Corvus hawaiiensis FWS.jpg|thumb|The [[Hawaiian crow]] is [[extinct in the wild]] as a result of [[habitat loss]] and other factors.]]\n\n===Status and conservation===\nUnlike many other bird [[family (biology)|families]], corvid [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] and reproduction, especially with many crows, has increased due to human development. The survival and reproductive success of certain crows and ravens is assisted by their close relationship with humans.<ref name = m&n2006 />\n\nHuman development provides additional resources by clearing land, creating shrublands rich in berries and insects. When the cleared land naturally replenishes, jays and crows use the young dense trees for nesting sites. Ravens typically use larger trees in denser forests.<ref name = m&n2006 />\n\nDespite the fact that most corvids are not threatened (many even increasing due to human activity) a few species are in danger. For example, the destruction of the Southeast Asian rainforests is endangering [[mixed-species feeding flock]]s with members from the family Corvidae.<ref name=Lee/> Also, since its [[semiarid]] scrubland [[habitat]] is an endangered [[ecosystem]], the [[Florida scrub jay]] has a small and declining population.<ref name=BLI/><ref name=Breininger/> A number of island species, which are more vulnerable to [[introduced species]] and habitat loss, have been driven to extinction, such as the [[New Zealand raven]], or are threatened, like the [[Mariana crow]].\n\nThe [[American crow]] population of the United States has grown over the years. It is possible that the American crow, due to humans increasing suitable habitat, will cause [[Northwestern crow]]s and [[fish crow]]s to decline.<ref name=Marzluff/>\n\n==Species==\n\n'''FAMILY

It follows the [[surreal humor|surreal]] adventures of two [[funny animal]] siblings, Cow and Chicken. They are often antagonized by the Red Guy, a cartoon [[Satan|Devil]] who poses as various characters to scam them.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=138-139 }}</ref>\n\nThe original pilot appeared as an episode of the animation showcase series ''[[What a Cartoon!]]''. The popularity of the original short allowed [[Hanna-Barbera]] to give it the green light for a full series, which premiered on July 15, 1997. Originally, ''Cow and Chicken'' was attached to another segment called ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', which was later spun-off into [[I Am Weasel|its own half-hour series]] on June 10, 1999. The series was produced by Hanna-Barbera Cartoons. It was nominated for two [[Emmy Award]]s.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Cow and Chicken No Smoking Poster.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Poster for the series' pilot, featuring the Red Guy (''left''), Cow (''center''), and Chicken (''right'').]]\nThe series focuses on the misadventures of two unlikely yet somehow biological siblings: the sweet-natured, dim, ecstatic, [[anthropomorphic]] Cow Steer and her cynical older brother Chicken Steer (both voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]). The two are often caught in escapades with their flamboyant enemy, the Red Guy (Adler), who disguises himself under various personas to attempt to scam them.\n\nSupporting characters include Chicken and Cow's [[wikt:delirious|delirious]] human parents Dad and Mom ([[Dee Bradley Baker]] and [[Candi Milo]], respectively), only seen from the waist down; Chicken's best friends Flem ([[Howard Morris]]) and Earl ([[Dan Castellaneta]]); and his [[cousin]], Boneless Chicken (Adler).\n\nThe series draws on eccentric, surreal, grotesque, and repulsive humor. For example, Cow and Chicken always order \"pork butts and taters\" in the cafeteria, the Red Guy always shows his butt, and characters often pepper their speech with malapropisms and sarcasm. The humor and storylines depicted are often based on traditional childhood worries, anxieties, or phobias such as [[cooties]] or venturing into the girls' restroom, but enhanced comically.\n\nMany of the slapstick antics involve Cow getting physically abused. Because [[Hinduism]] considers the cow a sacred animal, the series was largely ignored in India.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tickling the Global Funny Bone: Cartoon Network Tweaks Shows to Click with Humor Around the World|first=Matt|last=Kempner|date=March 6, 2002|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|department=Atlanta & the World|page=4E}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nDavid Feiss first created ''Cow and Chicken'' as a story for his daughter.<ref name=\"creation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonnetworkla.com/english/watch/creator/dfeiss.html|title=Animator Profile: David Feiss|work=cartoonnetworkla.com|publisher=Cartoon Network|access-date=2007-07-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516002446/http://www.cartoonnetworkla.com/english/watch/creator/dfeiss.html|archivedate=2006-05-16}}</ref> Feiss was an animator who had worked with [[Hanna-Barbera]] and related projects since 1978.<ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nYears later, Feiss was called to submit ideas for ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'', a series of various animated shorts from numerous creators and writers.

As a supporting segment, the show included a cartoon called ''I Am Weasel''; this segment was spun off as an independent series late in the show's run. Typically, an episode would consist of two seven-minute ''Cow and Chicken'' shorts playing back-to-back, then followed by a seven-minute ''I Am Weasel'' short before the end credits.<ref name=\"gallo\"/> The exception to this structure was episode 105 (\"The Ugliest Weenie\"), which had the ''Weasel'' short (\"I Are Big Star\") play in-between the two ''Cow and Chicken'' shorts, possibly because said shorts were one storyline.\n\nReruns continued to be shown on Cartoon Network from 1999 to 2003, and again from 2005 to 2008 as part of the network's blocks titled ''[[The Cartoon Cartoon Show]]'' and ''Top 5''.\n\n===Controversial episode===\nThe second season segment \"Buffalo Gals\", first paired with \"Cow and Chicken Reclining\", was banned by Cartoon Network after receiving one letter of complaint from a parent about the episode's liberal visual and verbal innuendo about the titular biker group being lesbians. In the segment, the Buffalo Gals break into people's homes to chew on the carpet, a biker named Munch Kelly has a carpet swatch for a calling card, and when Dad freaks out over the Buffalo Gals in the house, Mom says, \"They're not after you.\"<ref name=\"buffalo1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_18672_the-6-creepiest-things-ever-slipped-into-childrens-cartoons.html|title=The 6 Creepiest Things Ever Slipped Into Children's Cartoons|author=Anthony Scibelli|date=August 6, 2010|publisher=[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]|access-date=January 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511114141/http://www.cracked.com/article_18672_the-6-creepiest-things-ever-slipped-into-childrens-cartoons.html|archive-date=May 11, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition, the Buffalo Gals play softball and talk about pitching and catching.

The episode was also discussed on an installment of [[Rob Paulsen]]'s ''Talkin' Toons'' special featuring ''Cow and Chicken'' creator David Feiss and voice actor [[Charlie Adler]] when an audience member asked why \"Buffalo Gals\" only aired once.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It follows the [[surreal humor|surreal]] adventures of two [[funny animal]] siblings, Cow and Chicken. They are often antagonized by the Red Guy, a cartoon [[Satan|Devil]] who poses as various characters to scam them.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=138-139 }}</ref>\n\nThe original pilot appeared as an episode of the animation showcase series ''[[What a Cartoon!]]''. The popularity of the original short allowed [[Hanna-Barbera]] to give it the green light for a full series, which premiered on July 15, 1997. Originally, ''Cow and Chicken'' was attached to another segment called ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', which was later spun-off into [[I Am Weasel|its own half-hour series]] on June 10, 1999. The series was produced by Hanna-Barbera Cartoons. It was nominated for two [[Emmy Award]]s.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Cow and Chicken No Smoking Poster.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Poster for the series' pilot, featuring the Red Guy (''left''), Cow (''center''), and Chicken (''right'').]]\nThe series focuses on the misadventures of two unlikely yet somehow biological siblings: the sweet-natured, dim, ecstatic, [[anthropomorphic]] Cow Steer and her cynical older brother Chicken Steer (both voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]). The two are often caught in escapades with their flamboyant enemy, the Red Guy (Adler), who disguises himself under various personas to attempt to scam them.\n\nSupporting characters include Chicken and Cow's [[wikt:delirious|delirious]] human parents Dad and Mom ([[Dee Bradley Baker]] and [[Candi Milo]]), only seen from the waist down; Chicken's best friends Flem ([[Howard Morris]]) and Earl ([[Dan Castellaneta]]); and his [[cousin]], Boneless Chicken (Adler).\n\nThe series draws on eccentric, surreal, grotesque, and repulsive humor. For example, Cow and Chicken always order \"pork butts and taters\" in the cafeteria, the Red Guy always shows his butt, and characters often pepper their speech with malapropisms and sarcasm. The humor and storylines depicted are often based on traditional childhood worries, anxieties, or phobias such as [[cooties]] or venturing into the girls' restroom, but enhanced comically.\n\nMany of the slapstick antics involve Cow getting physically abused. Because [[Hinduism]] considers the cow a sacred animal, the series was largely ignored in India.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tickling the Global Funny Bone: Cartoon Network Tweaks Shows to Click with Humor Around the World|first=Matt|last=Kempner|date=March 6, 2002|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|department=Atlanta & the World|page=4E}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nDavid Feiss first created ''Cow and Chicken'' as a story for his daughter.<ref name=\"creation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonnetworkla.com/english/watch/creator/dfeiss.html|title=Animator Profile: David Feiss|work=cartoonnetworkla.com|publisher=Cartoon Network|access-date=2007-07-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516002446/http://www.cartoonnetworkla.com/english/watch/creator/dfeiss.html|archivedate=2006-05-16}}</ref> Feiss was an animator who had worked with [[Hanna-Barbera]] and related projects since 1978.<ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nYears later, Feiss was called to submit ideas for ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'', a series of various animated shorts from numerous creators and writers.
