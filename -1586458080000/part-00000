For example, compared with V70, the V80 had a 32-bit hardware multiplier to reduce integer multiplication cycles to 9 from 23. (For more detailed differences, see hardware architecture section below.) The V80 was manufactured in 0.8-micrometer CMOS process with a die area of {{nowrap|14.49 \u00d7 15.47 mm<sup>2</sup>}} consisting of 980,000 transistors. It was packaged in a 280-pin [[Pin grid array|PGA]], and operated at 25 and 33&nbsp;MHz with claimed peak performance of 12.5 and 16.5 MIPS, respectively. V80 had separated 1&nbsp;KB on-die cache both for instructions and for data, and had 64-entry [[branch predictor]]; the performance gain, attributed to the latter, was about 5%.

The V60/V70/V80 themselves can perform floating point arithmetic, but they are very slow because of microcode operations without dedicated hardware. In 1989, to compensate V60/V70/V80 for their fairly weak floating point performance, NEC launched the 80-bit floating point co-processor; for 32-bit [[Single-precision floating-point format|single precision]], for 64-bit [[Double-precision floating-point format|double precision]], and for 80-bit [[extended precision]] [[IEEE 754]] format operations.<ref name=\"coproc\"/><ref name=\"overview\"/> This chip claimed 6.7 [[MFLOPS]] in the vector-[[matrix multiplication]], operating at 20&nbsp;MHz.

On the V60/V70 four registers (ATBR0 to ATBR3) store section pointers on the processor, but the area tables entries (ATE) and [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|page tables entries (PTE)]] are stored into off-chip RAM. The V80 merged the ATE and ATBR registers, which are both on-chip with only the [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|PTE]] entries stored into external RAM, allowing for a faster execution of [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] misses by eliminating one memory read.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nThe TLBs on the V60/70 are 16-entry [[CPU cache#Associativity|fully associative]] with replacement done by [[microcode]]. The V80 in contrast has a 64-entry 2-way [[set associative]] [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] with replacement done in hardware. [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] replacement took 58 cycles in the V70 and also disrupted the pipelined execution of other instructions. On the V80 a TLB replacement took only 6/11 cycles depending if the page was in the same area or not; pipeline disruption no longer occurred in V80 because of the separate TLB replacement hardware unit which operated in parallel to the rest of the processor.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three processors used the same protection mechanism with 4 execution levels (set via a [[program status word]]), with [[ring 0]] being the privileged level that could access a special set of privileged registers on the processors.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three models supported a triple-mode redundancy configuration with three CPUs used in a [[byzantine fault tolerance]] scheme with bus freeze, instruction retry, and chip replacement signals.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"compcon1988\"/> The V80 also added parity signals to its data and address buses.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nString operations were implemented in [[microcode]] in the V60/V70, but aided by hardware Data Control Unit in the V80, running at full bus speed. This made string operations about five times faster in the V80.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll floating point operations are largely implemented in microcode across the family and thus and are fairly slow. On the V60/V70 the 32-bit floating point operations took 120/116/137 cycles for addition/multiplication/division, while the corresponding 64-bit floating point operations took 178/270/590 cycles. The V80 had some limited hardware assist for parts of the floating point operations, e.g. decomposition into sign, exponent and mantissa, thus its floating point unit was claimed up to 3 times as effective as the one of the V70, with 32-bit operations taking 36/44/74 cycles while 64-bit floating point operations taking 75/110/533 cycles on the V80 (again, for addition/multiplication/division).<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|PC-UX/V Rel 2.0 (V60)|Real-time UNIX RX-UX 832|RX-UX 832|RX-UX832|MUSTARD|RX616|NEC RX116|RX116|}}Operating Systems ==\n\n=== Unix (non-real-time and real-time) ===\n\nNEC ported several variants of [[Unix]] to its V60/V70/V80 processors for user-application-oriented systems, including real-time ones.

The internal execution for each instruction of the V80 needed at least 2 cycles, while that of i486 was 1. The internal pipeline of the V80 seemed [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, asynchronous pipelines|buffered A-synchronous]], but that of i486 was [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, synchronous pipelines|synchronous]]. In other words, the internal [[microarchitecture]] of V80 was [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]], but that of i486 was [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]. Both of their [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]] had long non-uniform [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] instructions, so i486 adopted wider 128-bit internal [[cache memory]], while that of V80 was 32-bit width. This difference can be seen on their die photos.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\"/><ref name=\"micro1990\"/><ref name=\"i486-ICCD89\"/>\nThis strategic failure was fatal from the performance point of view, but NEC did not change its design. NEC might be able to throw away its [[Physical design (electronics)|physical design]], and to reconsider in [[register-transfer level]] as soon as possible, but it did not.\n\n=== Fading ===\nThe V60-V80 architecture did not enjoy much commercial success.<ref name=\"Meth\u00e91991\"/>\n\nThe V60, V70, and V80 were listed in 1989 and 1990 NEC catalogs in their [[Pin grid array|PGA]] packaging.<ref name=\"cat89\"/><ref name=\"cat90\"/> A NEC catalog from 1995 still listed the V60 and V70 (not only in their [[Pin grid array|PGA]] version but also in a [[Quad Flat Package|QFP]] packaging, and also included a low-cost variant of the V60 named \u03bcPD70615, which eliminated V20/V30 emulation and FRM function), alongside their assorted chipset, but the V80 is not offered in this catalog.<ref name=\"cat95\"/> The 1999 edition of the same catalog no longer has any V60-V80 products.<ref name=\"cat99\"/>\n\n=== {{anchor|NEC V810|NEC V820|NEC V830|\u03bcPD70732|\u03bcPD70742}}The V800&nbsp;Series ===\n\nIn 1992, NEC launched new model, the V800&nbsp;Series 32-bit [[microcontroller]], but it did not have [[Memory management unit|MMU (Memory Management Unit)]].<ref name=\"1992-ARC-06\"/> It had [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]-based architecture, inspired by the [[Intel i960]], [[MIPS architecture]], and other [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] processor instructions, such as JARL (Jump and Register Link), and [[load/store architecture]].\n\nAt this moment, all the huge software assets of the V60/V70, like real-time Unix, were lost and never returned to their successors.

The [[:ja:\u30b7\u30d0\u30f3\u30e0\u30b7|#4]] seems to be skipped (see page 58 <ref name=\"cat95\"/>), probably because of Japanese [[tetraphobia]].

The CAD system supports three design methodologies--symbolic layout mixed with mask level layout, compaction as an optimizer, and fully automated verification. For the area optimization, the symbolic layout and compactor subsystem supports a flexible description of orthogonal layout patterns with arbitrary dimensions in a loose placement manner. The layout patterns include path data, polygonal data, and symbolic cells. For power and delay optimization, the compactor compacts layout data, decreasing both resistance and capacitance for wires and ion-implanted layers. This feature is pioneering the new generation compactor. Emphasis should be put on the fact that it can compact layout data to a format 10-15 percent smaller than that accomplished manually. The verification subsystem can detect all kinds of errors, more than 30 items. A novel feature of the electrical rule check is that it investigates complementary logic errors for CMOS circuits. The synergy of those three design methodologies has brought about several significant advantages. One is manpower reduction by more than half, in the most complicated design process for unique random logic. The other is a 1600-transistors compaction output, smaller by 365 mils/sup 2/ than that manually compacted. The circuit implementation on a chip works at more than a 15&nbsp;MHz clock rate. Another is the first silicon success. It has been accomplished in a full-custom VLSI microcomputer chip consisting of more than 100 000 transistors.}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- JOURNAL, V800 ----->\n\n<ref name=\"1992-ARC-06\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Harigai|first1=Hisao|last2=Kusuda|first2=Masaori|last3=Kojima|first3=Shingo|last4=Moriyama|first4=Masatoshi|last5=Ienaga|first5=Takashi|last6=Yano|first6=Yoichi|title=\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u30fb\u4f4e\u96fb\u5727\u52d5\u4f5c\u306e32\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5V810|journal=SIG Technical Reports, Information Processing Society of Japan|date=1992-10-22|volume=1992|issue=82 (1992-ARC-096)|pages=41\u201348|url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/170000021173|trans-title=A low power consumption and low voltage operation 32-bit RISC Microprocessor|quote=<br/>Abstract:<br/>An advanced 32-bit RISC microprocessor for embedded control; V810 is introduced in this paper.

A variety of techniques previously associated only with RISC (reduced-instruction-set computer) processors are used to execute the average instruction in 1.8 clocks. This represents a 2.5* reduction from its predecessor, the 386 microprocessor. The pipeline and clock count comparisons are described in detail. In addition, an onchip floating-point unit is included which yields a 4* clock count reduction from the 387 numeric coprocessor. The microarchitecture enhancements and optimizations used to achieve this goal, most of which are non-silicon-intensive, are discussed. All instructions of the 386 microprocessor and the 387 numeric coprocessor are implemented in a completely compatible fashion.}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=J.H.|title=The i486 CPU: executing instructions in one clock cycle|journal=IEEE Micro|date=February 1990|volume=10|issue=1|pages=27\u201336|doi=10.1109/40.46766|issn=0272-1732|citeseerx=10.1.1.126.4216}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"pj\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Hardenbergh |first1=Hal W | title=RISCs CISCs and Fabs|journal=Programmer's Journal|year=1988|publisher=Avant-Garde Creations|volume=6|issue=2|page=15|quote=<br/>So far we haven't mentioned two 32-bit CISC chips, the NEC V60/70 and the AT&T WE32 family.

Such trends called for a processor with both improved performance; by doubling the bus's width to 32 bits, and with flexibility; having large numbers of general-purpose registers.<ref name=\"maruzen\"/><ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/> These were common features of [[Reduced instruction set computer|''Reduced Instruction Set Computer'']].<ref name=\"Computer-Architecture-4thEd\"/> At the time, this transition from [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] to [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] seemed to bring many benefits for emerging markets.\n\nToday, [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] chips are common, although the[[x86|Intel's x86]] CISC designs have been mainstream for several decades, the[[x86]] [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]], [[Intel 80486|80486]] internally adopts [[RISC]] features.<ref name=\"i486-ICCD89\"/><ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\"/>\nAccording to [[Pat Gelsinger]], binary backward compatibility for legacy software is much important than changing the ISA.<ref name=\"CNET-2007\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|V60|D70616|\u03bcPD70616|.mu.PD70616}}Overview ==\n\n=== Instruction set ===\n\nThe V60 (\u03bcPD70616) /.mu.PD70616/ retained a [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] architecture.<ref name=\"Wade, 1996\"/> Its manual describes them as being[[Mainframe computer|mainframe-computer]]-based, with a fully [[orthogonal instruction set]], comprising; non-uniform length instructions, memory-to-memory operations including string manipulation, and fairly complex operand addressing schemes.<ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/><ref name=\"maruzen\"/><ref name=\"Computer-Architecture-4thEd\"/>\n\n=== Family ===\n\nThe V60 operates as a 32 bit processor internally, whilst externally providing 16 bit data and 24 bits address buses. In addition, the V60 has 32 (32-bit) general-purpose registers.<ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/>{{rp|\u00a71}}\nIts basic [[Computer architecture|architecture]] is used in several variants. The V70 (\u03bcPD70632), released in 1987, provides 32 bit external buses. Launched in 1989, the V80 (\u03bcPD70832)<ref name=\"overview\"/> is the culmination of the series; having on-chip caches, a branch predictor and less reliance on [[microcode]] for complex operations.<ref name=\"micro1990\"/>\n\n=== Software ===\n\nThe [[operating system]] developed for the V60-V80 series, are generally oriented toward [[Real-time operating system|real-time operation]]s.

It requires multiple devices of the same model,  one of which then becomes the \"master mode,\" while the other devices listen to the master device in the \"checker mode.\" If two or more devices output different result via their \"fault output\" pins simultaneously, a majority voting decision can be made by external circuits.

By incorporating on-chip caches and a [[branch predictor]], it was declared NEC's [[Intel 486|486]] by ''[[Computer Business Review]]''.<ref name=\"CBR-1\"/><ref name=\"CBR-2\"/> The performance of V80 was two to four times than that of V70, depending on application. For example, compared with V70, the V80 had a 32-bit hardware multiplier to reduce integer multiplication cycles to 9 from 23. (For more detailed differences, see hardware architecture section below.) The V80 was manufactured in 0.8-micrometer CMOS process with a die area of {{nowrap|14.49 \u00d7 15.47 mm<sup>2</sup>}} consisting of 980,000 transistors. It was packaged in a 280-pin [[Pin grid array|PGA]], and operated at 25 and 33&nbsp;MHz with claimed peak performance of 12.5 and 16.5 MIPS, respectively. V80 had separated 1&nbsp;KB on-die cache both for instructions and for data, and had 64-entry [[branch predictor]]; the performance gain, attributed to the latter, was about 5%. The launch prices of V80 were cited as equivalent to $1200 for the 33&nbsp;MHz model and $960 for the 25&nbsp;MHz model. Supposedly a 45&nbsp;MHz model was scheduled for 1990,<ref name=\"CBR-2\"/> but did not materialize.\n\nThe V80, associated with \u03bcPD72691 co-FPP and \u03bcPD71101 simple [[peripheral]] chips, was used for [[Industrial PC|industrial computer]] with the [[RX-UX832]] real-time UNIX and a [[X Window System|X11-R4]] based window system.<ref name=\"Meiden-Jiho-Jul92\"/><ref name=\"Meiden-Jiho-May93\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|\u03bcPD72691|.mu.PD72691|D72691|AFPP}}AFPP (co&#8209;FPP) ==\n\nThe AFPP (\u03bcPD72691) /.mu.PD72691/ is a co-processor for floating point arithmetic operations.<ref name=\"Majithi, 1987\"/> The name stands for Advanced Floating Point Processor as is described in NEC's data sheet. The V60/V70/V80 themselves can perform floating point arithmetic, but they are very slow because of microcode operations without dedicated hardware. In 1989, to compensate V60/V70/V80 for their fairly weak floating point performance, NEC launched the 80-bit floating point co-processor; for 32-bit [[Single-precision floating-point format|single precision]], for 64-bit [[Double-precision floating-point format|double precision]], and for 80-bit [[extended precision]] [[IEEE 754]] format operations.<ref name=\"coproc\"/><ref name=\"overview\"/> This chip claimed 6.7 [[MFLOPS]] in the vector-[[matrix multiplication]], operating at 20&nbsp;MHz. It was [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] in 1.2-micrometer double-metal layer CMOS process containing 433,000 transistors on an {{nowrap|11.6 \u00d7 14.9 mm<sup>2</sup>}} die.<ref name=\"coproc\"/> It was packaged in a 68-pin [[Pin grid array|PGA]]. This co-processor connected to V80 via the dedicated bus. But in case of connecting to V60 and V70, it shared their main buses, which scenario diminished their peak performance.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|arch}}Hardware Architecture ==\nV60/V70/V80 shared the basic architecture. They had thirty-two 32-bit [[general-purpose register]]s, although the last three of them were commonly used as [[stack pointer]], [[frame pointer]], and [[argument pointer]], those were well matched with [[High-level programming language|high level language]] [[compiler]]s' [[calling convention]]s.<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/><ref name=\"GCC-Internal\"/> The V60 and V70 had a 119-instruction set,<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-069\"/> slightly extended to 123 instructions for the V80. The instructions have [[Complex instruction set computing|non-uniform length]] between one and 22 bytes,<ref name=\"V60-Prog-Ref-Man\"/> and they take two operands, both of which can be memory locations.<ref name=\"overview\"/> After studying the V60's reference manual, [[Paul Vixie]] described it as \"a very [[VAX]]-ish arch, with a V20/V30 emulation mode (which, if you recall, means it can run Intel 8086/8088 software)\".<ref name=\"google-groups\"/>\n\nV60-V80 had a built-in [[Memory management unit|MMU]]<ref name=\"SIG-ARC-043\"/><ref name=\"Majithi, 1987\"/> that divide the 4 GB [[Virtual memory|virtual address space]] into in four 1-GB sections, each section further divided in 1,024 1-MB areas, each area composed of 256 4-KB pages. On the V60/V70 four registers (ATBR0 to ATBR3) store section pointers on the processor, but the area tables entries (ATE) and [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|page tables entries (PTE)]] are stored into off-chip RAM. The V80 merged the ATE and ATBR registers, which are both on-chip with only the [[Memory management unit#Page table entries|PTE]] entries stored into external RAM, allowing for a faster execution of [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] misses by eliminating one memory read.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nThe TLBs on the V60/70 are 16-entry [[CPU cache#Associativity|fully associative]] with replacement done by [[microcode]]. The V80 in contrast has a 64-entry 2-way [[set associative]] [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] with replacement done in hardware. [[Translation lookaside buffer|TLB]] replacement took 58 cycles in the V70 and also disrupted the pipelined execution of other instructions. On the V80 a TLB replacement took only 6/11 cycles depending if the page was in the same area or not; pipeline disruption no longer occurred in V80 because of the separate TLB replacement hardware unit which operated in parallel to the rest of the processor.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three processors used the same protection mechanism with 4 execution levels (set via a [[program status word]]), with [[ring 0]] being the privileged level that could access a special set of privileged registers on the processors.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll three models supported a triple-mode redundancy configuration with three CPUs used in a [[byzantine fault tolerance]] scheme with bus freeze, instruction retry, and chip replacement signals.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"compcon1988\"/> The V80 also added parity signals to its data and address buses.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nString operations were implemented in [[microcode]] in the V60/V70, but aided by hardware Data Control Unit in the V80, running at full bus speed. This made string operations about five times faster in the V80.<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\nAll floating point operations are largely implemented in microcode across the family and thus and are fairly slow. On the V60/V70 the 32-bit floating point operations took 120/116/137 cycles for addition/multiplication/division, while the corresponding 64-bit floating point operations took 178/270/590 cycles. The V80 had some limited hardware assist for parts of the floating point operations, e.g. decomposition into sign, exponent and mantissa, thus its floating point unit was claimed up to 3 times as effective as the one of the V70, with 32-bit operations taking 36/44/74 cycles while 64-bit floating point operations taking 75/110/533 cycles on the V80 (again, for addition/multiplication/division).<ref name=\"overview\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|PC-UX/V Rel 2.0 (V60)|Real-time UNIX RX-UX 832|RX-UX 832|RX-UX832|MUSTARD|RX616|NEC RX116|RX116|}}Operating Systems ==\n\n=== Unix (non-real-time and real-time) ===\n\nNEC ported several variants of [[Unix]] to its V60/V70/V80 processors for user-application-oriented systems, including real-time ones.

What developer need is a [[C (programming language)|C]] [[compiler]], self as well as [[Cross compiler|cross]], and the [[Debugger#Debugger front-ends|screen debugger]], working with the target device, such as [[GNU Debugger#Graphical user interface|GDB-Tk]].\n\n=== IE-V60 ===\n\nThe IE-V60 was the first ''in-circuit emulator'' for V60 manufactured by NEC.

The internal execution for each instruction of the V80 needed at least 2 cycles, while that of i486 was 1. The internal pipeline of the V80 seemed [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, asynchronous pipelines|buffered A-synchronous]], but that of i486 was [[Pipeline (computing)#Buffered, synchronous pipelines|synchronous]]. In other words, the internal [[microarchitecture]] of V80 was [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]], but that of i486 was [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]. Both of their [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]] had long non-uniform [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] instructions, so i486 adopted wider 128-bit internal [[cache memory]], while that of V80 was 32-bit width. This difference can be seen on their die photos.<ref name=\"overview\"/><ref name=\"i486-Micro-1990\"/><ref name=\"micro1990\"/><ref name=\"i486-ICCD89\"/>\nThis strategic failure was fatal from the performance point of view, but NEC did not change its design. NEC might be able to throw away its [[Physical design (electronics)|physical design]], and to reconsider in [[register-transfer level]] as soon as possible, but it did not.\n\n=== Fading ===\nThe V60-V80 architecture did not enjoy much commercial success.<ref name=\"Meth\u00e91991\"/>\n\nThe V60, V70, and V80 were listed in 1989 and 1990 NEC catalogs in their [[Pin grid array|PGA]] packaging.<ref name=\"cat89\"/><ref name=\"cat90\"/> A NEC catalog from 1995 still listed the V60 and V70 (not only in their [[Pin grid array|PGA]] version but also in a [[Quad Flat Package|QFP]] packaging, and also included a low-cost variant of the V60 named \u03bcPD70615, which eliminated V20/V30 emulation and FRM function), alongside their assorted chipset, but the V80 is not offered in this catalog.<ref name=\"cat95\"/> The 1999 edition of the same catalog no longer has any V60-V80 products.<ref name=\"cat99\"/>\n\n=== {{anchor|NEC V810|NEC V820|NEC V830|\u03bcPD70732|\u03bcPD70742}}The V800&nbsp;Series ===\n\nIn 1992, NEC launched new model, the V800&nbsp;Series 32-bit [[microcontroller]], but it did not have [[Memory management unit|MMU (Memory Management Unit)]].<ref name=\"1992-ARC-06\"/> It had [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]]-based architecture, inspired by the [[Intel i960]], [[MIPS architecture]], and other [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] processor instructions, such as JARL (Jump and Register Link), and [[load/store architecture]].\n\nAt this moment, all the huge software assets of the V60/V70, like real-time Unix, were lost and never returned to their successors. The scenario Intel circumvents.\n\nThe V800&nbsp;Series had 3 product line variants, the V810&nbsp;Family, the V830&nbsp;Family, and the [[V850|V850&nbsp;Family]].<ref name=\"EDN\"/><ref name=\"IEIEC-1995\"/><ref name=\"IEEE-1998\"/>\n\nV820 (\u03bcPD70742) was a simple variant of V810 (\u03bcPD70732) with peripherals. The [[:ja:\u30b7\u30d0\u30f3\u30e0\u30b7|#4]] seems to be skipped (see page 58 <ref name=\"cat95\"/>), probably because of Japanese [[tetraphobia]].  One [[Japanese pronunciation]] of \"4\" means \"death.\" So the successors well avoid the [[Deathwatch beetle|Death-watch]]; Shi-ban (#4; Shi-ban) ''[[Software bug|Bug]]'' ({{nihongo2|[[:ja:\u30b7\u30d0\u30f3\u30e0\u30b7|\u6b7b\u756a\u866b]]}}, precisely ''[[deathwatch beetle]]''). As of 2005, it was already the [[V850]] era, and the [[V850]]&nbsp;Family has been enjoying great success.<ref name=\"cat05\"/> As of 2018, it is called Renesas V850&nbsp;Family and RH850&nbsp;Family with V850/V850E1/V850E2 and V850E2/V850E3 CPU cores, respectively. Those CPU cores have extended [[Instruction set architecture|ISA]] of original V810 CPU core;<ref name=\"V810-GCC\"/> running with V850 compiler.<ref name=\"GHS-V850\"/>\n\n== {{anchor|sw-emulator|ISS|MEME}}Emulator (CPU Simulator) Software ==\n\n=== MAME ===\n\nBecause the V60/V70 had been used for many Japanese [[game arcade]]s, their [[instruction set architecture]] has still survived as [[Emulator#CPU simulator|CPU simulator]] for this niche market. It is called [[MAME|MAME (''Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator'')]], which emulates multiple old [[game arcade]]s for enthusiasts.<ref name=\"v60-cemu\"/> It is a kind of an [[instruction set simulator]], not for developers but for users.\n\nNowadays, it has been kept providing by the [http://www.mamedev.org/ ''MAME development team''].

The CAD system supports three design methodologies--symbolic layout mixed with mask level layout, compaction as an optimizer, and fully automated verification. For the area optimization, the symbolic layout and compactor subsystem supports a flexible description of orthogonal layout patterns with arbitrary dimensions in a loose placement manner. The layout patterns include path data, polygonal data, and symbolic cells. For power and delay optimization, the compactor compacts layout data, decreasing both resistance and capacitance for wires and ion-implanted layers. This feature is pioneering the new generation compactor. Emphasis should be put on the fact that it can compact layout data to a format 10-15 percent smaller than that accomplished manually. The verification subsystem can detect all kinds of errors, more than 30 items. A novel feature of the electrical rule check is that it investigates complementary logic errors for CMOS circuits. The synergy of those three design methodologies has brought about several significant advantages. One is manpower reduction by more than half, in the most complicated design process for unique random logic. The other is a 1600-transistors compaction output, smaller by 365 mils/sup 2/ than that manually compacted. The circuit implementation on a chip works at more than a 15&nbsp;MHz clock rate. Another is the first silicon success. It has been accomplished in a full-custom VLSI microcomputer chip consisting of more than 100 000 transistors.}}\n</ref>\n\n<!----- JOURNAL, V800 ----->\n\n<ref name=\"1992-ARC-06\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Harigai|first1=Hisao|last2=Kusuda|first2=Masaori|last3=Kojima|first3=Shingo|last4=Moriyama|first4=Masatoshi|last5=Ienaga|first5=Takashi|last6=Yano|first6=Yoichi|title=\u4f4e\u6d88\u8cbb\u96fb\u529b\u30fb\u4f4e\u96fb\u5727\u52d5\u4f5c\u306e32\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30c3\u30b5V810|journal=SIG Technical Reports, Information Processing Society of Japan|date=1992-10-22|volume=1992|issue=82 (1992-ARC-096)|pages=41\u201348|url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/170000021173|trans-title=A low power consumption and low voltage operation 32-bit RISC Microprocessor|quote=<br/>Abstract:<br/>An advanced 32-bit RISC microprocessor for embedded control; V810 is introduced in this paper.

This frustration mixed with a desire of luxury makes Paul anxious to make a perfect way of living. This causes him to purposely separate himself from everyone else leading to feelings of isolation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sirridge|first1=Marjorie|title=Paul's Case|url=http://medhum.med.nyu.edu/view/1227|website=NYU School of Medicine|accessdate=December 3, 2017}}</ref> While his appreciation of the arts is more social and superficial than aesthetic, he dreams of another life in which he would attend concerts and theater.

At the start of the story, Paul is suspended from his high school in Pittsburgh for a week. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado, which is later shown to be of importance. He then goes to work at [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Hall]] in Pittsburgh. Here he works as an usher and can be himself by serving those in his section with grand enthusiasm. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of abuse, so much so that while in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake all night imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four lovely children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, he lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards, a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing over $2000 from his new job at Denny & Carson's to finance a new life. He buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public.

Note that on his way back from New York, he gazes out of the train window to see nothing of the sort besides the snow that has already fallen - A depressing representation that Paul's fantasy has come to an end.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Czernicki |first1=Martha |title=Fantasy and Reality in Willa Cather's PAUL'S CASE |journal=The Explicator |date=2017 |volume=75 |issue=4 |page=242|doi=10.1080/00144940.2017.1379466 }}</ref>\n\n'''Paul's Smile''' - There are several instances where Paul's smile is brought up in the story and a few different interpretations of what his smile symbolizes. When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors. Paul's smile in this circumstance displays his cocky attitude and shows that he doesn't care about what the authorities have to say to him.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://englishivbl2b.pbworks.com/w/page/19070348/%22Paul%27s%20Case%22%20--%20Cork%20Terborg,%20Payton%20Laczynski,%20Katie%20Erickson|title=English / \"Paul's Case\" -- Cork Terborg, Payton Laczynski, Katie Erickson|website=englishivbl2b.pbworks.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> A different interpretation of Paul's smile arises from the detail where Paul's drawing master claimed there was, \"something sort of haunted about [his smile],\" which is a detail that is often used to support the idea that Paul's smile refers to him having a disability.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Foreshadowing==\nThe foreshadowing demonstrated in \"Paul's Case\" is seen in the carnations that Paul wears.
