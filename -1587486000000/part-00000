It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]]. The series is produced by [[Marvel Studios]], with Waldron serving as [[head writer]] and Kate Herron directing.\n\n[[Tom Hiddleston]] reprises his role as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] from the film series. [[Sophia Di Martino]], [[Owen Wilson]], and [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] also star. With Marvel Studios developing a number of limited series for Disney+ centered on supporting characters from the MCU films, the series was officially confirmed in November 2018, along with Hiddleston's involvement. Waldron was hired in February 2019, and Herron had joined by that August. Filming of the series began in January 2020.\n\n''Loki'' is expected to be released in early 2021, and will consist of six episodes. It will be part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU.\n\n==Premise==\nAfter the events of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), Loki uses the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]] to travel through time and alter human history.<ref name=\"Logline\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]:<br />[[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]'s adoptive brother and god of mischief based on the Norse mythological deity of the [[Loki|same name]].<ref name=\"HiddlestonConfirmed\" /> This version of Loki created a new timeline in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) beginning in 2012, so he has not gone through the events of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013) or ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017) which \"reformed\" the previously villainous character.<ref name=\"Logline\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Sophia Di Martino]],<ref name=\"Martino\" /> [[Owen Wilson]],<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> and [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] have been cast in undisclosed roles.<ref name=\"Mbatha-Raw\" />\n\n===Guest===\n* [[Richard E.

The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each and have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios, rather than [[Marvel Television]] who produced [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|previous television series in the MCU]]. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\" /> focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" /> Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] confirmed in November that a series centered on Loki was in development and that [[Tom Hiddleston]] was expected to reprise his role from the film series.<ref name=\"Disney+Loki\" />\n\nMichael Waldron was hired as [[head writer]] and executive producer of the series in February 2019. He was also set to write the pilot episode. The series was expected to follow Loki as he \"pops up throughout human history as an unlikely influencer on historical events\".<ref name=\"Waldron\" /> A month later, Feige stated that Loki is over a thousand years old in the MCU films, so the series would be exploring what he has done throughout his long life. He added that the interest for Marvel Studios in making the series was to work with Hiddleston more and explore the character of Loki beyond him being a supporting character in the films.<ref name=\"FeigeConnectedMar2019\" /> Hiddleston explained in August 2019 that he had known about his cameo role in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) when he filmed Loki's death for ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), but he considered the latter to be the emotional end of his character arc. He then learned about the plans for a Loki series around six weeks before ''Infinity War'' was released, and kept the series a secret until its official announcement later that year. He expressed excitement about being able to change Loki in different ways by taking an earlier version of the character and \"seeing him come up against more formidable opponents, the like of which he has never seen\".<ref name=\"HiddlestonMTVAug2019Yahoo\" /> Also that month, Kate Herron was revealed to be directing and executive producing the miniseries, which was confirmed to run for six episodes.<ref name=\"Herron\" /><ref name=\"EpisodesRuntime\" /><ref name=\"Durald\" />\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Tom Hiddleston (48468962561) cropped.jpg|thumb|Hiddleston promoting the series at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nThe series takes place after ''Avengers: Endgame'', which saw Loki steal the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]] during the 2012 events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012),<ref name=\"DigitalSpySDCC\" /> which created an alternate timeline from the main MCU films.<ref name=\"AltTimeline\" /> In the series, Loki uses the Tesseract to travel through time and alter human history.<ref name=\"Logline\" /> In August 2019, Herron stated that the series would be \"taking Loki to an entirely new part of the MCU\" while Waldron said it would \"explore the questions we all have: where did Loki go after he picked up the Tesseract? Could Loki ever make a friend? And will the sun ever shine on him again?\"<ref name=\"Herron\" /> Executive producer Stephen Broussard stated that in addition to the time travel element, the series would have a \"man-on-the-run quality to it\".<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" /> Waldron also felt the series would explore the character's \"struggle with identity\", adding \"over the first 10 years of movies, he's out of control at pivotal parts of his life, he was adopted and everything and that manifest itself through anger and spite towards his family.\"<ref name=\"WaldronMar2020\" /> According to Feige, the series will tie-into the 2021 film ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]''.<ref name=\"Strange\" />\n\n===Casting===\nWith the November 2018 announcement of the series, Hiddleston was expected to reprise his role as Loki,<ref name=\"Disney+Loki\" /> with his involvement confirmed in February 2019 by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] chairman [[Alan F. Horn]].<ref name=\"HiddlestonConfirmed\" /> In November 2019, [[Sophia Di Martino]] was cast in a \"highly contested\" unspecified role,<ref name=\"Martino\" /> reported to be a female incarnation of Loki.<ref name=\"Martino2\" /> In January 2020, [[Owen Wilson]] joined the cast as \"a prominent character\",<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> followed the next month with the casting of [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] as the female lead, also said to be \"a prominent character\".<ref name=\"Mbatha-Raw\"/>\n\nIn March 2020, [[Richard E.

[[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Coronavirus\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nA commercial for the series, ''[[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]]'', and ''[[WandaVision]]'' was shown during [[Super Bowl LIV]].<ref name=\"SuperBowlSpot\" /> Julia Alexander of ''[[The Verge]]'' said the footage \"wasn't much\" but offered \"enough glimpses to tease fans\".<ref name=\"VergeSuperBowlSpot\"

With Marvel Studios developing a number of limited series for Disney+ centered on supporting characters from the MCU films, the series was officially confirmed in November 2018, along with Hiddleston's involvement. Waldron was hired in February 2019, and Herron had joined by that August. Filming of the series began in January 2020.\n\n''Loki'' is expected to be released in early 2021, and will consist of six episodes.

The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each and have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios, rather than [[Marvel Television]] who produced [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|previous television series in the MCU]]. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\" /> focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" /> Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] confirmed in November that a series centered on Loki was in development and that [[Tom Hiddleston]] was expected to reprise his role from the film series.<ref name=\"Disney+Loki\" />\n\nMichael Waldron was hired as [[head writer]] and executive producer of the series in February 2019. He was also set to write the pilot episode. The series was expected to follow Loki as he \"pops up throughout human history as an unlikely influencer on historical events\".<ref name=\"Waldron\" /> A month later, Feige stated that Loki is over a thousand years old in the MCU films, so the series would be exploring what he has done throughout his long life. He added that the interest for Marvel Studios in making the series was to work with Hiddleston more and explore the character of Loki beyond him being a supporting character in the films.<ref name=\"FeigeConnectedMar2019\" /> Hiddleston explained in August 2019 that he had known about his cameo role in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) when he filmed Loki's death for ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), but he considered the latter to be the emotional end of his character arc. He then learned about the plans for a Loki series around six weeks before ''Infinity War'' was released, and kept the series a secret until its official announcement later that year. He expressed excitement about being able to change Loki in different ways by taking an earlier version of the character and \"seeing him come up against more formidable opponents, the like of which he has never seen\".<ref name=\"HiddlestonMTVAug2019Yahoo\" /> Also that month, Kate Herron was revealed to be directing and executive producing the miniseries, which was confirmed to run for six episodes.<ref name=\"Herron\" /><ref name=\"EpisodesRuntime\" /><ref name=\"Durald\" />\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Tom Hiddleston (48468962561) cropped.jpg|thumb|Hiddleston promoting the series at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nThe series takes place after ''Avengers: Endgame'', which saw Loki steal the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]] during the 2012 events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012),<ref name=\"DigitalSpySDCC\" /> which created an alternate timeline from the main MCU films.<ref name=\"AltTimeline\" /> In the series, Loki uses the Tesseract to travel through time and alter human history.<ref name=\"Logline\" /> In August 2019, Herron stated that the series would be \"taking Loki to an entirely new part of the MCU\" while Waldron said it would \"explore the questions we all have: where did Loki go after he picked up the Tesseract? Could Loki ever make a friend? And will the sun ever shine on him again?\"<ref name=\"Herron\" /> Executive producer Stephen Broussard stated that in addition to the time travel element, the series would have a \"man-on-the-run quality to it\".<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" /> Waldron also felt the series would explore the character's \"struggle with identity\", adding \"over the first 10 years of movies, he's out of control at pivotal parts of his life, he was adopted and everything and that manifest itself through anger and spite towards his family.\"<ref name=\"WaldronMar2020\" /> According to Feige, the series will tie-into the 2021 film ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]''.<ref name=\"Strange\" />\n\n===Casting===\nWith the November 2018 announcement of the series, Hiddleston was expected to reprise his role as Loki,<ref name=\"Disney+Loki\" /> with his involvement confirmed in February 2019 by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] chairman [[Alan F. Horn]].<ref name=\"HiddlestonConfirmed\" /> In November 2019, [[Sophia Di Martino]] was cast in a \"highly contested\" unspecified role,<ref name=\"Martino\" /> reported to be a female incarnation of Loki.<ref name=\"Martino2\" /> In January 2020, [[Owen Wilson]] joined the cast as \"a prominent character\",<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> followed the next month with the casting of [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] as the female lead, also said to be \"a prominent character\".<ref name=\"Mbatha-Raw\"/>\n\nIn March 2020, [[Richard E. Grant]] was cast in an undisclosed role for a single episode of the series.<ref name=\"Grant\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began in January 2020,<ref name=\"FilmingEW\" /><ref name=\"Wilson\" /> under the [[working title]] ''River Cruise'',<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> with Herron directing.<ref name=\"Herron\" /> [[Autumn Durald]] serves as cinematographer for the series.<ref name=\"Durald\" /> Location shooting took place in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] throughout the month of February.<ref name=\"Atlanta\" /> On March 14, production on the series was halted due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Coronavirus\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nA commercial for the series, ''[[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier]]'', and ''[[WandaVision]]'' was shown during [[Super Bowl LIV]].<ref name=\"SuperBowlSpot\" /> Julia Alexander of ''[[The Verge]]'' said the footage \"wasn't much\" but offered \"enough glimpses to tease fans\".<ref name=\"VergeSuperBowlSpot\" /> Haleigh Foutch at ''[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'' felt of all the Super Bowl commercials, Marvel's teasers \"stole the whole show\" and had \"a lot to get excited about\".<ref

Actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the limited series, including [[Elizabeth Olsen]] as Scarlet Witch. The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each, have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\", and be produced by Marvel Studios rather than [[Marvel Television]], who produced [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|previous television series in the MCU]]. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\" /> focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" /> By the end of October, [[Paul Bettany]]'s [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] was expected to play a significant role in the series, which would focus on the relationship between Scarlet Witch and Vision.<ref name=\"ScarletWitchVision\" /> In the following months, the titles ''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' and ''The Vision and Scarlet Witch'' were both reported.<ref name=\"DeadlineTitle\" /><ref name=\"Schaeffer\" /><ref name=\"SchaefferDeadline\" />\n\n[[Jac Schaeffer]] was hired as [[head writer]] of the series in January 2019 after previously working as a writer on the films ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019) and ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020) for Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"Schaeffer\" /><ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" /> Schaeffer was set to write the pilot episode and executive produce the series.<ref name=\"Schaeffer\" /> That April, Disney and Marvel officially announced the series with the title ''WandaVision''.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> Later in the month, Olsen indicated parts of the series would be set in the 1950s.<ref name=\"OlsenApril2019\" /> In August, [[Matt Shakman]] was hired to direct the miniseries, which consists of six episodes.<ref name=\"Shakman\" /> Budgets for each episode were reported to be as much as $25 million.<ref name=\"Budgets\" /> At Disney's biennial convention [[D23 Expo|D23]], Feige described the series as part \"classic [[sitcom]]\", part \"Marvel epic\", and showed a teaser for the series that combined footage from previous MCU films featuring Maximoff and Vision with images from ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' and ''[[Father Knows Best]]''.<ref name=\"D232019\" /><ref name=\"YahooRoundUp\" /> Bettany called the series \"super avant-garde and weird\", while Olsen added that there were \"plenty of comic books that support\" the characters appearing in a sitcom setting.<ref name=\"IGND232019\" /> Olsen also indicated that there were ongoing discussions regarding whether the series would use a [[laugh track]].<ref name=\"YahooRoundUp\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe series takes place after ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'',<ref name=\"Parris\" /> and its events tie-into the 2021 MCU film ''[[Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'', which includes Maximoff.<ref name=\"DoctorStrange2\" /> Schaeffer hired eight writers for the series' writers room, including four women and several people of color because of her belief that \"stories are better the more perspectives you have\".<ref name=\"SchaefferInverseJul2019\" /> Megan McDonnell served as a staff writer on the series, before being promoted to story editor.<ref name=\"McDonnell\" /> Comparing her work on the series to the film ''Black Widow'', Schaeffer said ''WandaVision'' would be \"the polar opposite\" to the film's style of aggressive, visceral action.<ref name=\"SchaefferInverseJul2019\" /> Comic book writer [[Tom King (writer)|Tom King]] indicated in October 2019 that his run on ''The Vision'' would be an inspiration for ''WandaVision''.<ref name=\"KingInfluence\" /> In December 2019, Feige described the series as an opportunity to tell the story of Maximoff and Vision, show more of what Wanda can do, further explore who Vision is, and introduce the comic book name \"Scarlet Witch\" to the MCU \"in ways that are entirely fun, entirely funny, somewhat scary, and will have repercussions for the entire future of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase 4]] of the MCU\".<ref name=\"CCXP2019Feige\"/>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Elizabeth Olsen & Paul Bettany (48469160767).jpg|thumb|Olsen and Bettany at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con|San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\nWith the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Olsen and Bettany would reprise their roles of Maximoff and Vision, respectively, in the series.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> [[Teyonah Parris]] was announced as cast in the role of [[Monica Rambeau]] in July 2019;
