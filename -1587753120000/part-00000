The [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] found on the iPhone 8 has been replaced with Haptic Touch on the iPhone SE. It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera, similar to the single camera system of the [[iPhone 8]] and the [[iPhone XR]]. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash.

The phone can also take panoramas up to 63&nbsp;MP, and is capable of shooting photos in burst mode. Compared to the iPhone 8, the new processor of the SE adds support for extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps, stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization. The SE's camera interface adopts \"QuickTake\" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" />\n\nThe front camera is 7&nbsp;MP with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> \n\nBoth the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting. Smart HDR is featured on the rear camera, but not the front camera.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> Unlike the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, the iPhone SE does not support Night Mode, possibly because its camera is based on the iPhone 8 and iPhone XR single-camera systems.\n\n===Software===\nThe iPhone SE ships with [[iOS 13]].<!-- Apple Card is implicit with Apple Pay. --><ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\"/>\n\n== Timeline of iPhone models ==\n{{Timeline of iPhone models}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|IPhone SE (2nd generation)}}\n* {{Official site|https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/}}\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{Apple hardware since 1998}}\n{{Apple Inc. hardware}}\n{{Apple}}\n[[Category:IPhone|*]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:iOS]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the 2nd generation iPhone SE|its predecessor|iPhone SE (1st generation)|the general use of the term ''iPhone SE''|iPhone SE (disambiguation)}}\n<noinclude>\n{{User:RMCD bot/subject notice|1=iPhone SE (2020)|2=Talk:IPhone SE (2nd generation)#Requested move 16 April 2020}}\n</noinclude>\n{{pp-move|small=yes}}\n{{short description|thirteenth-generation Apple smartphone}}\n{{lowercase title}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox mobile phone\n| name         = iPhone SE\n| codename     = \n| logo         = IPhone SE (2nd generation) wordmark.svg\n| logosize     = <!-- include \"px\" - Uses users default image size if omitted -->\n| image        = IPhone SE (2nd generation) white vector.svg\n| imagesize    = \n| alt          = \n| caption      = iPhone SE in white, with black bezels\n| brand        = [[Apple Inc.]]\n| manufacturer = \n| slogan       = ''Lots to love.

It has the same top and bottom bezels on the front and a home button integrated with second-generation [[Touch ID]] as the iPhone 8.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/ |title = iPhone SE 2020: Everything We Know |website = MacRumors |language = en |access-date = April 15, 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180805112853/https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/ |archive-date = August 5, 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe iPhone SE is available in three colors \u2014 white, black,<!-- colors are not proper nouns --> and a [[Product Red|(Product) Red]] edition.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\"/> Where the SE deviates from the iPhone 8's design is with respect to the white model. Unlike the silver iPhone 8 (and all prior silver or white iPhones since the [[iPhone 4]]), the white iPhone SE features black bezels like the black model and red model, in line with the color schemes of the [[iPhone 11]] and [[iPhone XR|XR]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Color !!Name      <!-- hex codes from product selection page -->\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#1F2020\"| ||Black \n|-\n|bgcolor=\"F9F6EF\" |  ||White \n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#BA0C2E\"  |  ||Product Red\n|}\n\n== Specifications ==\n=== Size ===\nWith a screen diagonal of {{cvt|4.7|in}}, the second generation of the iPhone SE was among the smallest major in-production smartphones at the time of its release.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Axon|first=Samuel|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/04/why-apple-has-stopped-making-small-phones-and-why-it-should-start-again/|title=Why Apple has stopped making small phones\u2014and why it should start again|date=18 April 2020|work=Ars Technica|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> However, it was still thirty percent larger than the SE's first generation, whose screen diagonal measured in at {{cvt|4|in}}. This led to one journalist declaring that the SE was the \"nail in the coffin\" for small phones after rapid increases in size in smartphones of all models in recent years.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Seifert|first=Dan|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222642/iphone-se-2-size-comparison-small-phone-trend-galaxy-oneplus|title=Even \u2018small\u2019 phones are big now|date=15 April 2020|work=The Verge|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware===\nThe iPhone SE incorporates the Apple A13 Bionic system-on-chip (SoC) with an [[Apple motion coprocessors|M13 motion coprocessor]] and a third-generation neural engine. It is available in three internal storage configurations; 64&nbsp;GB, 128&nbsp;GB and 256&nbsp;GB.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> The SE has the same [[IP Code|IP67]] (dust-tight/30 minutes at 1m depth) rating for dust and water resistance as the iPhone 8.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> The phone lacks the [[ultra-wideband]] hardware (Apple U1 chip) found in the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/04/15/apples-new-iphone-se-doesnt-have-a-u1-ultra-wideband-chip|title=Apple's new iPhone SE doesn't have a U1 Ultra Wideband chip|website=appleinsider|last=Peterson|first=Mike|date=April 15, 2020|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n==== Display ====\nThe iPhone SE features the same Retina HD display found on the iPhone 8, with True Tone and wide color gamut ([[DCI-P3#Display P3|Display P3]]). The [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] found on the iPhone 8, has been replaced with Haptic Touch on the iPhone SE. It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera, similar to the single camera system of the [[iPhone 8]] and the [[iPhone XR]]. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash. It is capable of recording 4K video at 24&nbsp;fps, 30&nbsp;fps, or 60&nbsp;fps, 1080p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps or 60&nbsp;fps, or 720p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps. The phone can also take panoramas up to 63&nbsp;MP, and is capable of shooting photos in burst mode. Compared to the iPhone 8, the new processor of the SE adds support for extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps, stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization. The SE's camera interface adopts \"QuickTake\" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" />\n\nThe front camera is 7&nbsp;MP with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> \n\nBoth the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting. Smart HDR is featured on the rear camera, but not the front camera.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> Unlike the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, the iPhone SE does not support Night Mode, possibly because its camera is based on the iPhone 8 and iPhone XR single-camera systems.\n\n===Software===\nThe iPhone SE ships with [[iOS 13]].<!-- Apple Card is implicit with Apple Pay. --><ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\"/>\n\n== Timeline of iPhone models ==\n{{Timeline of iPhone models}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|IPhone SE (2nd generation)}}\n* {{Official site|https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/}}\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{Apple hardware since 1998}}\n{{Apple Inc. hardware}}\n{{Apple}}\n[[Category:IPhone|*]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:iOS]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n", "name_user": "Prahlad balaji", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDisplay:Minor grammar fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_SE_(2nd_generation)"}

Ehrman (a scholar of the Greek New Testament and Early Christianity) says that the question people ask him most often is whether Mary Magdalene and Jesus of Nazareth married each other (after the claim was popularized in ''The Da Vinci Code''): <blockquote>It is not true that the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] contained Gospels that discussed Mary and Jesus. (...) Nor is it true that the marriage of Mary and Jesus is repeatedly discussed in the Gospels that didn't make it into the New Testament. In fact, it is never discussed at all\u2014never even mentioned, not even once. (...) It is not true that the Gospel of Philip calls Mary Jesus' spouse.<ref>B. D.

In the text, this ''beloved disciple'' is present at the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], with [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Jesus' mother, Mary]].\n\nThe ''disciple whom Jesus loved'' may be a self-reference by the author of the Gospel (John 21:24), traditionally regarded as [[John the Apostle]]. Rollan McCleary, author of ''Signs for a Messiah'', thinks this identification would make the phrase highly significant.<ref>Crosswalk: ''[http://www.crosswalk.com/1202502 Gay Jesus' Claim Draws Fire]'' by Patrick Goodenough, Pacific Rim Bureau Chief, CNSNews.com.</ref>\n\n[[File:Valentin de boulogne, John and Jesus.jpg|thumb|''Jesus and John at the Last Supper'', by [[Valentin de Boulogne]]]]\n\nIn subsequent centuries the reference was used by those who implied a [[homosocial]] or [[homoerotic]] reading of the relationship. For example, LGBT scholar [[Louis Crompton]] says Saint [[Aelred of Rievaulx]], in his work ''De spiritali amicitia'' (\"Spiritual Friendship\"), referred to the relationship of Jesus and John the Apostle as a \"marriage\" and held it out as an example sanctioning friendships between clerics.<ref>Louis Crompton, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', p. 180</ref>\n\n[[James I of England]] may have been relying on a pre-existing tradition when he defended his relationship with the young [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]]: \"I wish to speak in my own behalf and not to have it thought to be a defect, for Jesus Christ did the same, and therefore I cannot be blamed.

Originally designed in response to very large Italian sex toy along the lines of the French {{sclass-|Amiral Baudin|ironclad|4}}, by the time work on ''Hoche'' began, changes in French design philosophy led to a radical re-design that provided the basis for a generation of French [[capital ship]]s. Her armament was reduced in size compared to the ''Amiral Baudin''s, and was placed in the [[lozenge]] arrangement that would be used for most French capital ships into the 1890s. ''Hoche'' suffered from serious stability problems that resulted from her large [[superstructure]] and low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], which required extensive work later in her career to correct. The ship incorporated new technologies for the French Navy, including [[gun turret]]s for some of her [[main battery]] guns and [[compound armor]] plate.\n\n''Hoche'' initially served with the Northern Squadron after entering service in 1890, but was sent to the Mediterranean Squadron the following year. She remained there for the next four years, during which time she accidentally rammed and sank a merchant vessel outside [[Marseilles]]. In 1895, she was moved back to the Northern Squadron, and that year she visited Germany for the opening of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]]. The ship remained in the unit until 1898, when she was [[ship commissioning|decommissioned]] to be thoroughly reconstructed. Work was completed in 1901, and she served briefly with the Northern Squadron that year before being transferred to the Reserve Division of the Mediterranean Squadron in 1902. She spent the next several years in a state with reduced crews, being activated to take part in training exercises with the rest of the fleet. She remained assigned to the Reserve Division through 1908, but saw no further service; she was ultimately sunk as a [[target ship]] in 1913.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Warship, Algiers, Algeria-LCCN2001697826.jpg|thumb|left|The {{sclass-|Amiral Baudin|ironclad|1}} {{ship|French ironclad|Formidable||2}}; its very large 76-ton gun can be seen under the awning]]\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u20131871, the [[French Navy]] embarked on a construction program to strengthen the fleet in 1872. By that time, the Italian {{lang|it|[[Regia Marina]]}} (Royal Navy) had begun its own expansion program under the direction of [[Benedetto Brin]], which included the construction of several very large [[ironclad warship]]s of the {{sclass-|Caio Duilio|ironclad|5}} and {{sclass-|Italia|ironclad|4}}es, armed with {{cvt|450|mm|1}} 100-ton guns. The French initially viewed the ships as not worthy of concern, though by 1877, public pressure over the new Italian vessels prompted the Navy's {{lang|fr|Conseil des Travaux}} (Board of Construction) to design a response, beginning with the [[barbette ship]] {{ship|French ironclad|Amiral Duperr\u00e9||2}} and following with six vessels carrying 100-ton guns of French design. The first of these were the two {{sclass-|Amiral Baudin|ironclad|1}}s, which carried their guns in open [[barbette]]s, all on the [[centerline (nautical)|centerline]], with one forward and two aft.{{sfn|Ropp|pp=92\u201396}}\n\nProblems aboard other vessels with new 76-ton guns prompted the naval command to abandon the as-yet untested 100-ton weapons. A modified version of the 76-ton gun with a longer barrel and that had been adapted to use new [[propellant]] charges was developed; these changes gave it higher [[muzzle velocity]], which allowed its shells to penetrate as well as the 100-ton gun had been expected to perform. The ''Amiral Baudin''s were too advanced in their construction to allow their design to be revised, but the other four vessels of the program, which became ''Hoche'' and the three {{sclass-|Marceau|ironclad|1}}s, had not yet begun building. Their design, which was prepared by the naval engineer [[Charles Ernest Huin]], was radically altered from the ''Amiral Baudin'' arrangement to what would become the standard for future French [[capital ship]]s for the next two decades. The large caliber guns were increased to four, one forward, one aft, and a [[wing turret|wing mount]] on either side [[amidships]] to maximize end-on fire (which was emphasized by those who favored [[naval ram|ramming]] attacks).{{sfn|Ropp|pp=99\u2013101}}{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=18}}\n\nBy the time the design for these new ships was being finalized in early 1880, very large guns had fallen out of favor in the French Navy, so new 52-ton guns were substituted. The Navy had intended to build all four vessels to the same design, but after work began on ''Hoche'' in June 1880, the shipyard realized that Huin's design was unworkable; the proposed [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] dimensions were insufficient for the weight of armament to be carried. The shipyard engineers proposed widening the [[beam (nautical)|beam]] and increasing [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] to correct the problem, but ''Hoche'' was too far advanced in construction to allow the necessary changes without breaking up the existing hull structure. The other three ships, which became the ''Marceau''s, had not been [[keel laying|laid down]] and could be modified, and they retained the barbettes of the earlier ships. Since it was deemed cost prohibitive to rework ''Hoche''{{'}}s hull, other changes would have to be made. Her revised design was approved on 31 January 1881, with a slightly longer hull and a revised armament. Lighter 28-ton guns were substituted for her wing barbettes. Later, on 17 August 1882, the Navy requested that fully-armored [[gun turret]]s be used for her centerline guns; this made ''Hoche'' the first French capital ship to use armored turrets. Huin accepted this change, but the additional weight of the turrets forced the hull to be lowered by a deck to retain sufficient stability.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=18}}{{sfn|Ropp|p=100}}\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[File:French ironclad Hoche original configuration drawing.jpg|thumb|left|Top and profile drawing of ''Hoche'']]\n\n''Hoche'' was {{cvt|102.59|m|ftin}} [[long at the waterline]], with a beam of {{cvt|20.22|m|ftin}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{cvt|8.31|m|ftin}}. She displaced {{cvt|10820|LT|t|lk=in}}. The ship had a low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] and a very large [[superstructure]] that rendered her very top-heavy and as a result unstable.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}} Her superstructure was so large that she was nicknamed \"{{lang|fr|le Grand H\u00f4tel}}\".{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=18}} The problem was compounded by the fact that she was overweight on completion, which further reduced her freeboard.{{sfn|Leyland 1901a|p=35}} Her forward and aft [[conning tower]]s included [[bridge (nautical)|bridges]] that were [[cantilever]]ed over the main battery turrets. The hull featured a pronounced ram bow. She was fitted with a pair of heavy [[military mast]]s equipped with [[fighting top]]s that carried some of her light guns and were also used to spot for her [[main battery]] guns. Steering was controlled by a single large [[rudder]]. The crew consisted of 611&nbsp;officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}}{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=17}}\n\nHer propulsion machinery consisted of two vertical [[compound steam engine]]s that each drove a single [[screw propeller]]. Steam for the engines was provided by eight coal-burning [[fire-tube boiler]]s that were ducted into a single wide [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] that were placed directly astern of the conning tower. Her engines were rated to produce {{convert|12000|ihp|lk=on}} for a top speed of {{convert|16.5|kn|lk=in}}. Coal storage amounted to {{cvt|590|to|740|LT|t}}.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}}{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=16}} Her cruising radius was {{convert|610|nmi|lk=in}}, though the speed that enabled that range is unknown.{{sfn|Leyland 1901a|p=35}}\n\nHer main armament consisted of two [[340mm/28 Mod\u00e8le 1881 gun|{{cvt|340|mm}} Mod\u00e8le 1881 guns]] and [[274mm/28 Mod\u00e8le 1881 gun|{{cvt|274|mm}} Mod\u00e8le 1881 guns]], both of which were 28-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] weapons. They were all mounted in individual barbette mounts, with the 340&nbsp;mm guns on the centerline, forward and aft, and the 274&nbsp;mm guns in wing mounts amidships.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}} The 340&nbsp;mm guns fired {{cvt|350|kg}} [[high-explosive]] shells filled with [[Picric acid|melinite]] with a muzzle velocity of {{cvt|555|m/s}}. The 274&nbsp;mm guns fired {{cvt|216|kg}} shells at a velocity of {{cvt|600|m/s}}.{{sfn|Friedman|pp=206\u2013207, 216}}\n\nThese guns were supported by a [[battleship secondary armament|secondary battery]] of eighteen {{cvt|138|mm}} guns, all carried in individual pivot mounts. Fourteen of the guns were placed in a gun battery in the hull, seven guns per [[broadside]], and the remaining four were located at the four corners of the superstructure. For defense against [[torpedo boat]]s, she carried ten [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|{{cvt|47|mm}} 3-pounder guns]] and ten {{cvt|37|mm}} 1-pounder Hotchkiss revolvers, all in individual mounts. These were placed in a variety of locations, including in the fighting tops, in a small battery directly above the wing barbettes, and elsewhere in the superstructure. Her armament was rounded out with five {{cvt|380|mm|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s in above-water mounts. Two were placed on each broadside and the last was in the stern.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}}{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=17}}\n\n''Hoche'' was protected with [[compound armor]]; she was the first French capital ship to use the new type of armor.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=18}} Her [[belt armor|armor belt]] covered the entire length of the hull, and the central portion that protected her vitals\u2014the propulsion machinery spaces and ammunition [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]]\u2014was {{cvt|18|in|order=flip|0}}. The central portion was {{cvt|2|ft|order=flip}} above the [[waterline]] and {{cvt|5.5|ft|order=flip}} below, though it tapered to {{cvt|356|mm|0}} at the bottom edge.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}} But because of her overloaded condition, her belt was almost entirely submerged, significantly reducing its effectiveness.{{sfn|Leyland 1901a|p=35}} The bow section was {{cvt|254|mm|0}}, while the stern section of the hull was {{cvt|305|mm|0}} thick. Above the belt was a [[strake]] of {{cvt|3.2|in|order=flip}}. She had an armor [[deck (ship)|deck]] that consisted of {{cvt|3.1|in|order=flip}} of [[wrought iron]] on a layer of {{cvt|0.8|in|order=flip}} of [[mild steel]]; the armor deck was connected to the main belt armor just below the top edge. The main battery turrets and barbettes were {{cvt|406|mm|0}} thick, while the supporting tubes that connected them to their magazines consisted of {{cvt|240|mm|0}} of wrought iron. The conning tower had {{cvt|2.5|in|order=flip}} sides.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}}\n\n===Modifications===\n[[File:French ironclad Hoche post refit drawing.jpg|thumb|''Hoche'' after her 1898 reconstruction]]\n\nThe ship was modified several times over the course of her career to correct her stability deficiencies. Six of her 138&nbsp;mm guns were removed by 1895 in an effort to lighten her superstructure.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}}{{sfn|Brassey 1896b|p=137}} In 1898, ''Hoche'' underwent a more thorough reconstruction to remedy her instability and upgrade her armament and propulsion system. Her superstructure was reduced significantly to lower her [[center of mass]]. The old compound engines were replaced with vertical [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s and sixteen coal-fired, [[water-tube boiler|water-tube]] [[Belleville boiler]]s were installed in place of her original fire-tube boilers. Her original 138&nbsp;mm guns were removed and twelve [[Canon de 138 mm Mod\u00e8le 1893 naval gun|138&nbsp;mm Mod\u00e8le 1893 guns]] were added. Eight of these were placed in the battery, four per broadside, and the other four were placed in the upper deck mounts above the wing barbettes. Four 9-pounder guns were added to supplement the anti-torpedo boat defense. Two of her torpedo tubes were also removed. These alterations reduced her displacement to {{cvt|10580|LT|t}} at [[full load]].{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}} The reduction in weight restored her intended waterline and kept the side armor above the water. Her cruising range was increased to {{cvt|1292|nmi}}.{{sfn|Leyland 1901a|p=35}}\n\n==Service history==\n===Construction \u2013 1901===\n[[File:Lancement du Hoche mg 9695.jpg|thumb|left|Painting of ''Hoche'' at her launching ceremony]]\n\nThe [[keel]] for ''Hoche'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] in June 1881 in [[Lorient]], and she was [[ship launching|launched]] on 29 September 1886. [[Fitting-out]] work was completed in 1890.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}}{{sfn|Brassey 1888|p=331}} After [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] that year, she was assigned to the Northern Squadron, based in the [[English Channel]]. She served as the [[flagship]] of the unit, at that time commanded by Admiral [[Alfred Gervais]].{{sfn|Brassey 1890|pp=64\u201365}} In 1891, she was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron, where she conducted [[sea trials]].{{sfn|Weyl 1892|p=12}} During the fleet maneuvers of 1891, which began on 23 June, ''Hoche'' was assigned to the 2nd Division, 1st Squadron along with the ironclads {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}} and {{ship|French ironclad|Amiral Baudin||2}}. The maneuvers lasted until 11 July.{{sfn|Thursfield 1892|pp=61\u201367}} On 7 July 1892, ''Hoche'' accidentally collided with the mail steamer {{SS|Mar\u00e9chal Canrobert}} as the two vessels were passing through the [[roadstead]] outside [[Marseilles]], striking her with her ram amidships and nearly cutting the steamer in half. The latter's captain tied ''Mar\u00e9chal Canrobert'' to ''Hoche'' to allow his passengers and crew to come aboard ''Hoche''. After they were successfully evacuated, he cut the line connecting the ships and ''Mar\u00e9chal Canrobert'' quickly foundered.{{sfn|Chronicle of Events in 1892|p=42}}\n\nThe ship remained in service with the Mediterranean Squadron in 1892, which by that time had been joined by the three ''Marceau''-class ironclads.{{sfn|Brassey 1893|p=70}} She participated in the 1893 maneuvers, again as part of the 2nd Division in company with the ironclad ''Amiral Duperr\u00e9'' and ''Amiral Baudin''; that year, she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Le Bourgeois.

The exercises were held from 6 to 26 July, beginning with drills for the crews and concluding with a simulated battle between a squadron led by ''Hoche'' against an \"enemy\" unit that was to raid the French coast and escape, which it succeeded in doing.{{sfn|Thursfield 1897|pp=167\u2013168, 173\u2013174}}\n\n''Hoche'' again participated in the large-scale maneuvers of 1897, which were held in July. ''Hoche'' and the bulk of the squadron were tasked with intercepting ''Bouvines'', which was to steam from [[Cherbourg]] to [[Brest, France|Brest]] between 15 and 16 July. As with the previous year's maneuvers, the defending squadron was unable to intercept ''Bouvines'' before she reached Brest. The squadron then moved to [[Quiberon Bay]] for another round of maneuvers from 18 to 21 July. This scenario saw the [[protected cruiser]]s {{ship|French cruiser|Sfax||2}} and {{ship|French cruiser|Tage||2}} simulate a hostile fleet steaming from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to attack France's Atlantic coast. Unlike previous exercises, ''Hoche'' and the rest of the Northern Squadron successfully intercepted the cruisers and \"defeated\" them.{{sfn|Thursfield 1898|pp=140\u2013143}} After the new [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{ship|French battleship|Mass\u00e9na||2}} entered service in June 1898, she took ''Hoche''{{'}}s place as the flagship of the Northern Squadron.

The Northern Squadron ships formed part of the hostile force, and as it was entering the Mediterranean from the Atlantic, represented a German squadron attempting to meet its Italian allies. The exercises began on 3 July and concluded on 28 July. In August and September, the Northern Squadron conducted [[amphibious assault]] exercises. On 28 August, they escorted a group of [[troop ship]]s from Brest to [[La Rochelle]].

Originally designed in response to very large Italian ironclads along the lines of the French {{sclass-|Amiral Baudin|ironclad|4}}, by the time work on ''Hoche'' began, changes in French design philosophy led to a radical re-design that provided the basis for a generation of French [[capital ship]]s. Her armament was reduced in size compared to the ''Amiral Baudin''s, and was placed in the [[lozenge]] arrangement that would be used for most French capital ships into the 1890s. ''Hoche'' suffered from serious stability problems that resulted from her large [[superstructure]] and low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], which required extensive work later in her career to correct. The ship incorporated new technologies for the French Navy, including [[gun turret]]s for some of her [[main battery]] guns and [[compound armor]] plate.\n\n''Hoche'' initially served with the Northern Squadron after entering service in 1890, but was sent to the Mediterranean Squadron the following year. She remained there for the next four years, during which time she accidentally rammed and sank a merchant vessel outside [[Marseilles]]. In 1895, she was moved back to the Northern Squadron, and that year she visited Germany for the opening of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]]. The ship remained in the unit until 1898, when she was [[ship commissioning|decommissioned]] to be thoroughly reconstructed. Work was completed in 1901, and she served briefly with the Northern Squadron that year before being transferred to the Reserve Division of the Mediterranean Squadron in 1902. She spent the next several years in a state with reduced crews, being activated to take part in training exercises with the rest of the fleet. She remained assigned to the Reserve Division through 1908, but saw no further service; she was ultimately sunk as a [[target ship]] in 1913.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Warship, Algiers, Algeria-LCCN2001697826.jpg|thumb|left|The {{sclass-|Amiral Baudin|ironclad|1}} {{ship|French ironclad|Formidable||2}}; its very large 76-ton gun can be seen under the awning]]\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u20131871, the [[French Navy]] embarked on a construction program to strengthen the fleet in 1872. By that time, the Italian {{lang|it|[[Regia Marina]]}} (Royal Navy) had begun its own expansion program under the direction of [[Benedetto Brin]], which included the construction of several very large [[ironclad warship]]s of the {{sclass-|Caio Duilio|ironclad|5}} and {{sclass-|Italia|ironclad|4}}es, armed with {{cvt|450|mm|1}} 100-ton guns. The French initially viewed the ships as not worthy of concern, though by 1877, public pressure over the new Italian vessels prompted the Navy's {{lang|fr|Conseil des Travaux}} (Board of Construction) to design a response, beginning with the [[barbette ship]] {{ship|French ironclad|Amiral Duperr\u00e9||2}} and following with six vessels carrying 100-ton guns of French design. The first of these were the two {{sclass-|Amiral Baudin|ironclad|1}}s, which carried their guns in open [[barbette]]s, all on the [[centerline (nautical)|centerline]], with one forward and two aft.{{sfn|Ropp|pp=92\u201396}}\n\nProblems aboard other vessels with new 76-ton guns prompted the naval command to abandon the as-yet untested 100-ton weapons. A modified version of the 76-ton gun with a longer barrel and that had been adapted to use new [[propellant]] charges was developed; these changes gave it higher [[muzzle velocity]], which allowed its shells to penetrate as well as the 100-ton gun had been expected to perform. The ''Amiral Baudin''s were too advanced in their construction to allow their design to be revised, but the other four vessels of the program, which became ''Hoche'' and the three {{sclass-|Marceau|ironclad|1}}s, had not yet begun building. Their design, which was prepared by the naval engineer [[Charles Ernest Huin]], was radically altered from the ''Amiral Baudin'' arrangement to what would become the standard for future French [[capital ship]]s for the next two decades. The large caliber guns were increased to four, one forward, one aft, and a [[wing turret|wing mount]] on either side [[amidships]] to maximize end-on fire (which was emphasized by those who favored [[naval ram|ramming]] attacks).{{sfn|Ropp|pp=99\u2013101}}{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=18}}\n\nBy the time the design for these new ships was being finalized in early 1880, very large guns had fallen out of favor in the French Navy, so new 52-ton guns were substituted. The Navy had intended to build all four vessels to the same design, but after work began on ''Hoche'' in June 1880, the shipyard realized that Huin's design was unworkable; the proposed [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] dimensions were insufficient for the weight of armament to be carried. The shipyard engineers proposed widening the [[beam (nautical)|beam]] and increasing [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] to correct the problem, but ''Hoche'' was too far advanced in construction to allow the necessary changes without breaking up the existing hull structure. The other three ships, which became the ''Marceau''s, had not been [[keel laying|laid down]] and could be modified, and they retained the barbettes of the earlier ships. Since it was deemed cost prohibitive to rework ''Hoche''{{'}}s hull, other changes would have to be made. Her revised design was approved on 31 January 1881, with a slightly longer hull and a revised armament. Lighter 28-ton guns were substituted for her wing barbettes. Later, on 17 August 1882, the Navy requested that fully-armored [[gun turret]]s be used for her centerline guns; this made ''Hoche'' the first French capital ship to use armored turrets. Huin accepted this change, but the additional weight of the turrets forced the hull to be lowered by a deck to retain sufficient stability.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=18}}{{sfn|Ropp|p=100}}\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[File:French ironclad Hoche original configuration drawing.jpg|thumb|left|Top and profile drawing of ''Hoche'']]\n\n''Hoche'' was {{cvt|102.59|m|ftin}} [[long at the waterline]], with a beam of {{cvt|20.22|m|ftin}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{cvt|8.31|m|ftin}}. She displaced {{cvt|10820|LT|t|lk=in}}. The ship had a low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] and a very large [[superstructure]] that rendered her very top-heavy and as a result unstable.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}} Her superstructure was so large that she was nicknamed \"{{lang|fr|le Grand H\u00f4tel}}\".{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=18}} The problem was compounded by the fact that she was overweight on completion, which further reduced her freeboard.{{sfn|Leyland 1901a|p=35}} Her forward and aft [[conning tower]]s included [[bridge (nautical)|bridges]] that were [[cantilever]]ed over the main battery turrets. The hull featured a pronounced ram bow. She was fitted with a pair of heavy [[military mast]]s equipped with [[fighting top]]s that carried some of her light guns and were also used to spot for her [[main battery]] guns. Steering was controlled by a single large [[rudder]]. The crew consisted of 611&nbsp;officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}}{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=17}}\n\nHer propulsion machinery consisted of two vertical [[compound steam engine]]s that each drove a single [[screw propeller]]. Steam for the engines was provided by eight coal-burning [[fire-tube boiler]]s that were ducted into a single wide [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] that were placed directly astern of the conning tower. Her engines were rated to produce {{convert|12000|ihp|lk=on}} for a top speed of {{convert|16.5|kn|lk=in}}. Coal storage amounted to {{cvt|590|to|740|LT|t}}.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}}{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=16}} Her cruising radius was {{convert|610|nmi|lk=in}}, though the speed that enabled that range is unknown.{{sfn|Leyland 1901a|p=35}}\n\nHer main armament consisted of two [[340mm/28 Mod\u00e8le 1881 gun|{{cvt|340|mm}} Mod\u00e8le 1881 guns]] and [[274mm/28 Mod\u00e8le 1881 gun|{{cvt|274|mm}} Mod\u00e8le 1881 guns]], both of which were 28-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] weapons. They were all mounted in individual barbette mounts, with the 340&nbsp;mm guns on the centerline, forward and aft, and the 274&nbsp;mm guns in wing mounts amidships.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}} The 340&nbsp;mm guns fired {{cvt|350|kg}} [[high-explosive]] shells filled with [[Picric acid|melinite]] with a muzzle velocity of {{cvt|555|m/s}}. The 274&nbsp;mm guns fired {{cvt|216|kg}} shells at a velocity of {{cvt|600|m/s}}.{{sfn|Friedman|pp=206\u2013207, 216}}\n\nThese guns were supported by a [[battleship secondary armament|secondary battery]] of eighteen {{cvt|138|mm}} guns, all carried in individual pivot mounts. Fourteen of the guns were placed in a gun battery in the hull, seven guns per [[broadside]], and the remaining four were located at the four corners of the superstructure. For defense against [[torpedo boat]]s, she carried ten [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|{{cvt|47|mm}} 3-pounder guns]] and ten {{cvt|37|mm}} 1-pounder Hotchkiss revolvers, all in individual mounts. These were placed in a variety of locations, including in the fighting tops, in a small battery directly above the wing barbettes, and elsewhere in the superstructure. Her armament was rounded out with five {{cvt|380|mm|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s in above-water mounts. Two were placed on each broadside and the last was in the stern.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}}{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=17}}\n\n''Hoche'' was protected with [[compound armor]]; she was the first French capital ship to use the new type of armor.{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=18}} Her [[belt armor|armor belt]] covered the entire length of the hull, and the central portion that protected her vitals\u2014the propulsion machinery spaces and ammunition [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]]\u2014was {{cvt|18|in|order=flip|0}}. The central portion was {{cvt|2|ft|order=flip}} above the [[waterline]] and {{cvt|5.5|ft|order=flip}} below, though it tapered to {{cvt|356|mm|0}} at the bottom edge.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}} But because of her overloaded condition, her belt was almost entirely submerged, significantly reducing its effectiveness.{{sfn|Leyland 1901a|p=35}} The bow section was {{cvt|254|mm|0}}, while the stern section of the hull was {{cvt|305|mm|0}} thick. Above the belt was a [[strake]] of {{cvt|3.2|in|order=flip}}. She had an armor [[deck (ship)|deck]] that consisted of {{cvt|3.1|in|order=flip}} of [[wrought iron]] on a layer of {{cvt|0.8|in|order=flip}} of [[mild steel]]; the armor deck was connected to the main belt armor just below the top edge. The main battery turrets and barbettes were {{cvt|406|mm|0}} thick, while the supporting tubes that connected them to their magazines consisted of {{cvt|240|mm|0}} of wrought iron. The conning tower had {{cvt|2.5|in|order=flip}} sides.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}}\n\n===Modifications===\n[[File:French ironclad Hoche post refit drawing.jpg|thumb|''Hoche'' after her 1898 reconstruction]]\n\nThe ship was modified several times over the course of her career to correct her stability deficiencies. Six of her 138&nbsp;mm guns were removed by 1895 in an effort to lighten her superstructure.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}}{{sfn|Brassey 1896b|p=137}} In 1898, ''Hoche'' underwent a more thorough reconstruction to remedy her instability and upgrade her armament and propulsion system. Her superstructure was reduced significantly to lower her [[center of mass]]. The old compound engines were replaced with vertical [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s and sixteen coal-fired, [[water-tube boiler|water-tube]] [[Belleville boiler]]s were installed in place of her original fire-tube boilers. Her original 138&nbsp;mm guns were removed and twelve [[Canon de 138 mm Mod\u00e8le 1893 naval gun|138&nbsp;mm Mod\u00e8le 1893 guns]] were added. Eight of these were placed in the battery, four per broadside, and the other four were placed in the upper deck mounts above the wing barbettes. Four 9-pounder guns were added to supplement the anti-torpedo boat defense. Two of her torpedo tubes were also removed. These alterations reduced her displacement to {{cvt|10580|LT|t}} at [[full load]].{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}} The reduction in weight restored her intended waterline and kept the side armor above the water. Her cruising range was increased to {{cvt|1292|nmi}}.{{sfn|Leyland 1901a|p=35}}\n\n==Service history==\n===Construction \u2013 1901===\n[[File:Lancement du Hoche mg 9695.jpg|thumb|left|Painting of ''Hoche'' at her launching ceremony]]\n\nThe [[keel]] for ''Hoche'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] in June 1881 in [[Lorient]], and she was [[ship launching|launched]] on 29 September 1886. [[Fitting-out]] work was completed in 1890.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=292}}{{sfn|Brassey 1888|p=331}} After [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] that year, she was assigned to the Northern Squadron, based in the [[English Channel]]. She served as the [[flagship]] of the unit, at that time commanded by Admiral [[Alfred Gervais]].{{sfn|Brassey 1890|pp=64\u201365}} In 1891, she was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron, where she conducted [[sea trials]].{{sfn|Weyl 1892|p=12}} During the fleet maneuvers of 1891, which began on 23 June, ''Hoche'' was assigned to the 2nd Division, 1st Squadron along with the ironclads {{ship|French ironclad|Redoutable||2}} and {{ship|French ironclad|Amiral Baudin||2}}. The maneuvers lasted until 11 July.{{sfn|Thursfield 1892|pp=61\u201367}} On 7 July 1892, ''Hoche'' accidentally collided with the mail steamer {{SS|Mar\u00e9chal Canrobert}} as the two vessels were passing through the [[roadstead]] outside [[Marseilles]], striking her with her ram amidships and nearly cutting the steamer in half. The latter's captain tied ''Mar\u00e9chal Canrobert'' to ''Hoche'' to allow his passengers and crew to come aboard ''Hoche''. After they were successfully evacuated, he cut the line connecting the ships and ''Mar\u00e9chal Canrobert'' quickly foundered.{{sfn|Chronicle of Events in 1892|p=42}}\n\nThe ship remained in service with the Mediterranean Squadron in 1892, which by that time had been joined by the three ''Marceau''-class ironclads.{{sfn|Brassey 1893|p=70}} She participated in the 1893 maneuvers, again as part of the 2nd Division in company with the ironclad ''Amiral Duperr\u00e9'' and ''Amiral Baudin''; that year, she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Le Bourgeois. The maneuvers included an initial period of exercises from 1 to 10 July and then larger-scale maneuvers from 17 to 28 July.{{sfn|Thursfield 1894|pp=71\u201377, 79\u201380}} ''Hoche'' was transferred back to the Northern Squadron in 1895, by which time the coastal defense ironclads {{ship|French ironclad|Bouvines||2}}, {{ship|French ironclad|Amiral-Tr\u00e9houart||2}}, {{ship|French ironclad|Jemmapes||2}}, and {{ship|French ironclad|Valmy||2}}, along with the [[armored cruiser]] {{ship|French cruiser|Dupuy de L\u00f4me||2}}.{{sfn|Brassey 1895|p=52}} That year, she and ''Dupuy de L\u00f4me'' traveled to [[Kiel]], Germany, to represent France at the opening ceremonies for the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]] on 20 June.{{sfn|Brassey 1896b|p=136}} She remained in the Northern Squadron through the following year.{{sfn|Brassey 1896a|p=64}} During the maneuvers held in 1896, ''Hoche'' served as the flagship of Vice Admiral [[Rognault de Premesnil]]. The exercises were held from 6 to 26 July, beginning with drills for the crews and concluding with a simulated battle between a squadron led by ''Hoche'' against an \"enemy\" unit that was to raid the French coast and escape, which it succeeded in doing.{{sfn|Thursfield 1897|pp=167\u2013168, 173\u2013174}}\n\n''Hoche'' again participated in the large-scale maneuvers of 1897, which were held in July. ''Hoche'' and the bulk of the squadron were tasked with intercepting ''Bouvines'', which was to steam from [[Cherbourg]] to [[Brest, France|Brest]] between 15 and 16 July. As with the previous year's maneuvers, the defending squadron was unable to intercept ''Bouvines'' before she reached Brest. The squadron then moved to [[Quiberon Bay]] for another round of maneuvers from 18 to 21 July. This scenario saw the [[protected cruiser]]s {{ship|French cruiser|Sfax||2}} and {{ship|French cruiser|Tage||2}} simulate a hostile fleet steaming from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to attack France's Atlantic coast. Unlike previous exercises, ''Hoche'' and the rest of the Northern Squadron successfully intercepted the cruisers and \"defeated\" them.{{sfn|Thursfield 1898|pp=140\u2013143}} After the new [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{ship|French battleship|Mass\u00e9na||2}} entered service in June 1898, she took ''Hoche''{{'}}s place as the flagship of the Northern Squadron. The latter was then decommissioned to be reconstructed, along with several other ironclads built in the 1880s.{{sfn|Weyl 1898|pp=28\u201330}}{{sfn|Gardiner|pp=292, 294}} Work was completed by August 1901, when ''Hoche'' conducted sea trials before returning to service.{{sfn|Leyland 1901a|p=35}}\n\n===1901\u20131913===\n[[File:French ironclad Hoche post refit NH 88816.jpg|thumb|''Hoche'' after her initial 1895 refit]]\nAfter returning to active duty in 1901, ''Hoche'' once again joined the Northern Squadron.

The Northern Squadron ships formed part of the hostile force, and as it was entering the Mediterranean from the Atlantic, represented a German squadron attempting to meet its Italian allies. The exercises began on 3 July and concluded on 28 July. In August and September, the Northern Squadron conducted [[amphibious assault]] exercises. On 28 August, they escorted a group of [[troop ship]]s from Brest to [[La Rochelle]]. The ships conducted a simulated bombardment of the port, neutralized the coastal defenses, and put some 6,000&nbsp;men ashore.{{sfn|Leyland 1902|pp=119\u2013125}} The next year, ''Hoche'', ''Carnot'', and ''Amiral Baudin'' were transferred to the Reserve Division in the Mediterranean Squadron.{{sfn|Brassey 1902|p=47}} The ships in the Reserve Division were kept in a state of readiness with reduced crews that could be completed with naval reservists for the annual fleet exercises (or in the event of war).{{sfn|Jordan & Caresse|p=223}} ''Hoche'' and the rest of the Reserve Division participated in the 1902 fleet maneuvers, which occurred in three phases.

Much of her work includes community-based research, such as carbon or plastic audits, as well as collaborative art creation. \n\nIn 2013, Longobardi was awarded The Hudgens Prize <ref>https://thehudgens.org/hudgens-prize/</ref> and in 2014, she earned the title Distinguished University Professor of Art at [[Georgia State]], and was named  Artist-in-Residence of the [[Oceanic Society]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |title=Drifters Project |url=http://www.oceanicsociety.org/projects/drifters-project |website=The Oceanic Society}}</ref> In 2019, she was appointed Regents\u2019 Professor by the Board of Regents for the State of Georgia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pam Longobardi Awarded Regents' Professorship |url=https://news.gsu.edu/2019/06/28/pam-longobardi-awarded-regents-professorship/ |website=gsu.edu News Hub |publisher=Georgia State University |accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nPam Longobardi grew up in New Jersey,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://globaljournalist.org/2019/04/turning-ocean-garbage-into-advocacy-art/ |title = Turning ocean garbage into advocacy art|date = 2019-04-25}}</ref> the child of an ocean lifeguard and a Delaware state diving champion, and credits her parents' relationship to the water with her own scientific and artistic interests.

They promote themselves as having a larger and more varied playlist than most other commercial radio stations. It is not unusual for a Jack FM station to have a playlist of 700 to 2000 songs, while other FM radio stations may have playlists of fewer than 500 songs. Jack FM stations do not accept song requests from listeners. The format has also been likened to an [[MP3 player]] set on shuffle mode.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2006/07/71362 \"'Imitation iPod' Invades Radio\"]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901082621/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2006/07/71362|date=2010-09-01}}, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', July 13, 2006.</ref>  The stations that have the Jack FM format are in most cases officially classified as \"[[adult hits]]\" or \"variety hits\" by radio research companies.\n\n==Format characteristics==\nStations using the \"Jack\" name are very strictly licensed by SparkNet Communications. There are several terms that the station must agree to, one of them being the fact that [[disc jockeys]] are not to be used for at least the first few months of the format, among other things. SparkNet has also been very protective of its format, unsuccessfully filing [[trademark infringement]] suits against [[Bonneville International]] for its use of the Jack FM \"Playing What We Want\" trademark and other similar phrases. For this reason, many stations using a Jack-like format use slightly different slogans to avoid infringing on SparkNet's service marks: [[WBEN-FM]] in [[Philadelphia]] uses the tagline \"Playing anything we feel like\", for instance. On [[WLKO]] \"102.9 The Lake\" in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], the tagline is \"We Play Anything\". During its run as \"Doug FM\", [[WDRQ]] in [[Detroit]] used the line \"93.1 DOUG FM - We Play...EVERYTHING!\" \n\nJack FM stations in the [[United States]] and Canada use Howard Cogan and Andrew Anthony as the voice of Jack,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howardcogan.com/aboutnew|title=About Howard Cogan|website=howardcogan.com}}</ref> while all Jack FM stations in the [[United Kingdom]] use former [[Blake's 7]] actor [[Paul Darrow]] as the voice of Jack.\n\n==History==\n\n===2000\u20132003: Origins===\nOne of the early originators of the Jack FM format was radio programmer Bob Perry, on a United States-based [[Internet radio]] [[streaming audio|stream]] in 2000. Perry named the station after a fictitious persona, \"Cadillac Jack\" Garrett, \"a hard-living radio cowboy\". The back story created by Perry for the original webstream was that Garrett, a disc jockey who had worked many \"big sticks\", finally got his own radio station and after years of being told what he was to play on-air was creating a station where the motto was \"playing what we want\".  However, according to [[Rogers Communications]], the only thing taken, without permission, for the first Jack FM radio station, in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, was the name and the tagline. Pat Cardinal, one of the first Jack program directors, says that he was unaware of the type of music on the American website and that \"Jack\" was one of several names that were considered for the format. Rogers Communications came to an agreement with Perry for the use of the Jack FM name in Canada soon after the launch. The original webstream is still live to this day.\n\nJack was also inspired by the success of [[CHUM Limited]]'s \"[[Bob FM]]\" brand on [[CFWM]] radio in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba. Program director Howard Kroeger was inspired to create Bob FM after hearing a mix tape at a friend's 40th birthday party. Other Canadian broadcasters copied the concept as well, adopting such brands as [[Corus Entertainment]]'s \"[[CJDV-FM|Dave FM]]\" and \"[[CKNG-FM|Joe FM]]\". In 2003, an [[Ottawa]] station launched \"Frank FM\" as a one-day [[Halloween]] [[prank]]. (The prank's name was possibly also inspired by the Canadian satirical magazine ''[[Frank Magazine|Frank]]'', and probably the [[New England]] station [[Frank FM]].)\n\n[[File:Jackfmcrownlogo.png|thumb|Secondary Jack FM logo, often used on [[Entercom]] stations.]]\nBeginning in late 2002, the format was adopted on Canadian [[radio station]]s owned by [[Rogers Communications]]. The first Jack station was Vancouver's [[CJAX-FM|CKLG-FM]], which quickly shot to the top of the city's [[Bureau of Broadcast Measurement|BBM]] radio ratings. The format was consequently adopted on other Rogers stations in 2002 and 2003. The format proved popular in many markets where it was introduced, although its success was not always as dramatic as it had been in Vancouver.\n\n===2004\u20132005: Introduction to United States and controversies===\nIn 2004, SparkNet Communications, the owner of the Jack FM and \"Playing What We Want\" trademarks outside of Canada, started to license the Jack FM trademark in the United States. NRC Broadcasting's [[KJAC]] in [[Denver]] was the first US station to adopted the \"Jack FM\" format on April 14, 2004. The success of Jack caused a cloning effect, with some stations using the names of famous local figures, landmarks, or symbols to promote their version of the format. These variations have included [[WQQL|WABZ]] \"Abe FM\" in [[Springfield, Illinois]], named for [[Abraham Lincoln]]; [[WBEN-FM]] \"Ben FM\" in [[Philadelphia]], named for [[Benjamin Franklin]]; \"100.5 FM Louie\" in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; \"Doug-FM 93.1\" [[WDRQ]] in [[Detroit]]; \"96.7 Steve FM\" [[WLTY]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], named after [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|University of South Carolina football]] coach [[Steve Spurrier]]; [[WREE|WCFF]] \"The Chief 92.5 FM\" in [[Champaign, Illinois]], named for the controversial symbol of the [[University of Illinois]], [[Chief Illiniwek]]; [[WARH]] in [[St. Louis]], known as \"106.5 [[Gateway Arch|The Arch]]\", or even a body of water like \"106-5 The Lake\" [[WHLK]] in [[Cleveland]], named for [[Lake Erie]].\n\nOn July 29, 2005, [[Rawlco Communications|Rawlco]]'s [[CKCK-FM]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] became the first non-Rogers station in Canada to directly license the Jack FM brand rather than adopting an alternate name.\n\nOn May 4, 2005 at 11 a.m., [[WQSR]], an oldies station in [[Towson, Maryland]] which targeted [[Baltimore]] area listeners, changed its format from oldies to Jack FM. Listeners and staffers alike were surprised by the sudden change because many long-time DJs and on-air personalities were considered a Baltimore institution. WQSR received a large amount of negative publicity regarding the format change. Popular former WQSR personality Steve Rouse has since resurfaced as the new morning show host at sister station, the [[soft adult contemporary]]-formatted [[WLIF]].\n\n[[File:Jack SMALL.png|Logo used on Cumulus and iHeartMedia owned stations.|thumb|right]]\n\nBy far the introduction of Jack FM in [[New York City]] generated the most negative publicity of any market that switched a station to the format. On June 3, 2005 at 5:00&nbsp;p.m., [[WCBS-FM]], an oldies station in New York City, switched to Jack FM without any prior warning. The switch to a more generic format has been termed ''The Day the Music Died'' by some New Yorkers and has drawn criticism even from non-listeners of the station,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/opinion/nyregionopinions/19LIgoldman.html|title=The Day the Music Died|first=Kevin|last=Goldman|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 19, 2005|publisher=}}</ref> particularly due to the sudden firing of DJs of historic renown such as [[Cousin Brucie]]. In a partial nod to this controversy, on June 14, 2005, the station announced that it would tweak the format to include 1950s and early 1960s songs as well as performers such as [[Frank Sinatra]] \u2014 elements not typical of the Jack format. However, a later update retracted this and songs from before the late 1960s were no longer played.\n\nOne prominent reaction to the format change came in the form of a derogatory comment from the city's mayor. According to the ''New York Post'', mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] responded to the change by declaring he would \"never listen to that fucking CBS radio ever again\" (the quote was censored in the newspaper). The new Jack station quickly picked up on this, using its trademark sarcasm: \"Hey, Mayor Bloomberg. I heard you took a shot at us in the ''Post''. What's with all the swearin' like a sailor? [[Fleet Week]] is over. It's just music.\" Initially, [[Arbitron]] ratings showed a sharp decline and while ratings did recover, they never surpassed the levels that WCBS-FM had before the format switch.\n\nAs a result, on July 6, 2007, WCBS-FM announced it would drop Jack FM and restore the station's old format on July 12 with an updated [[classic hits]] approach, a move attributed mostly to the newly appointed CBS Radio CEO Dan Mason.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction%3DArticles.san%26s%3D63620%26Nid%3D32050%26p%3D407397 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-07-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227064523/http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san |archive-date=2007-02-27 }}, Retrieved on 2008/06/12</ref> Three of the fired DJs and staff (Dan Taylor, Bob Shannon, and Mr. G) returned to the station, along with newsman Al Meredith (who had stayed at the station during Jack FM doing his Sunday morning public affairs show), as well as DJ [[Pat St. John]] who had previously left CBS-FM for Q104.3 about a year before the flip to Jack. Steve O'Brien, a weekend and fill-in DJ at the time of the format change, would also return in a similar capacity in 2008. However, the Jack FM format now renamed ToNY is still available through WCBS-FM's HD2 subchannel, and via an internet stream at [http://www.1011hd2.com/ www.1011hd2.com].\n\nOn the same day that WCBS-FM made the switch, another station owned by CBS, [[WBMX (FM)|WJMK]], an oldies station in [[Chicago]], changed formats to Jack FM as well. The change at [[WBMX (FM)|WJMK]] didn't attract as much attention as the change to WCBS, but it still drew the ire of its listeners. The oldies format has since returned to the Chicago airwaves with the introduction of [[WLS-FM|WZZN]] (94.7 FM), in addition to WJMK reverting to [[classic hits]] in 2011.\n\nOn July 5, 2005, it was announced that Bohn & Associates Media and Wall Media formed SparkNet Communications L.P. as the exclusive international licensor and owner of the Jack FM format. SparkNet has, in turn, licensed the format to [[Dial Global]] for satellite-based syndication to stations in U.S. markets outside the 40 largest. This satellite-fed Jack became active in October 2005, and now serves many of the smaller Jack stations, such as those in [[Evansville, Indiana]] and [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].\n\nIn late September 2005, [[CKIS-FM|CJAQ-FM]] in [[Toronto]], announced that it would become the first DJ-free station in Canada. Pat Cardinal, general manager and program director of the station, announced that \"The move came as a result of listener feedback.\" \"The audience has been telling us that they want no DJs on Jack. They want more music.\" When it first launched, 92.5 Jack FM operated without disc jockeys in an effort to establish the \"Playing What We Want\" concept which was new to Toronto. DJs were introduced within weeks. In November 2005, Cardinal defended his decision in an interview with [[Michael Hainsworth]] of [[Report on Business Television]] and stated why he doesn't see commercial-free iPods and satellite radio as a threat to a non-DJ format.<ref>[http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Jack_FM_-_History/id/5173186 History Of Jack FM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408090751/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Jack_FM_-_History/id/5173186 |date=2009-04-08 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2005, [[Entravision Radio]] launched a [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] version of the Jack format dubbed \"Jos\u00e9\" with the \"We Play What We Want\" tagline translated into Spanish as \"Toca lo que Quiere\". \"Jos\u00e9\" went live on six FM and AM stations in [[KRCX-FM|Sacramento]], [[KCVR (AM)|Stockton]], and [[KCVR-FM|Modesto, California]]; [[KRZY (AM)|Albuquerque, New Mexico]]; and [[KMXA (AM)|Denver, Colorado]].<ref>Leila Cobo, \"Jos\u00e9 Is The Latin Jack,\" ''Billboard'', 11/12/2005, Vol. 117 Issue 46, p. 32.</ref> The \"Jos\u00e9\" stations have no affiliation with Jack, SparkNet Communications, or Bob Perry.\n\nOn October 25, 2005, Infinity Broadcasting announced that it would be replacing [[Howard Stern]] with Jack FM on some of its stations. Stern left terrestrial radio for [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] in late 2005.\n\n===2006\u2013present: North American format changes, international expansion===\nFollowing the format's explosive mid-2000s growth throughout North America, Jack FM continued to expand into smaller markets across the continent. However, in many cities the novelty wore off, and in the late 2000s a number of Jack stations modified their playlists drastically or flipped to other formats outright.\n\nIn May 2006, the playlist of [[CKIS-FM|CJAQ-FM]] in [[Toronto]] evolved into a [[mainstream rock]] format. The 1980s [[Top 40 (radio format)|top-40]] acts such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Kim Wilde]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], and [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] were dropped in favor of an all-rock playlist, and the station's slogan changed to \"Toronto's Best Rock Variety. However, In June 2009, the station flipped back to CHR and returned to its former \"Kiss\" branding as well as adopted its current call letters.\"<ref>[http://www.925jackfm.com/ 92.5 JackFM] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410044828/http://www.925jackfm.com/ |date=April 10, 2005 }}</ref> Similarly, Rawlco-owned CKCK-FM (the only non-Rogers operated Jack FM station) in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] adopted a classic rock direction in September, changing its slogan from the traditional \"Playing What We Want\" to \"The Greatest Rock Of All Time\" and adding announcers to its afternoon drive show. In 2010, the tagline was changed again to \"Regina's Greatest Hits\".\n\nIn October 2006, the UK's first Jack FM format station won a broadcast licence for the [[Oxford]] area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2006/10/nr_20061012 |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 13, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930041556/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2006/10/nr_20061012 |archive-date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> 106 Jack FM Oxford started broadcasting at 1:06 PM [[British Summer Time|BST]] on October 18, 2007.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} On December 2, 2009, Bristol radio station Original FM changed to Jack FM after requesting a format change with OFCOM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.5428 |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204202439/http://radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.5428 |archive-date=December 4, 2009 }}</ref> Two further Jack FM stations were planned on DAB digital radio from 2008 for Northamptonshire and Northeast Wales and West Cheshire{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} but by August 2009 were a year late with no indication of an [[Estimated time of arrival|ETA]].

In March 2011, WJMK dropped the Jack format in favor of [[classic hits]] as \"K-Hits\", featuring 1960s\u20131980s music. Eddie & Jobo (Ed Volkman and Joe Bohannon, former morning hosts at [[WBBM-FM]]) took over the morning show.\n\nOn June 29, 2012, it was announced that [[KSQN|KJQN]] in Salt Lake City would drop the \"Jack FM\" format on July 16, 2012 and begin to simulcast the talk radio format of [[KLO (AM)|KLO]].<ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/salt-lake-city-standalone-klo-1430-buys-kjqn-fm-1031]{{deadlink|date=March 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2013, [[KFBG (FM)|KFMB-FM]], the Jack FM station in San Diego, began restricting access to its online stream to listeners within the city of San Diego proper.<ref name=\"RI 2013-08-08 KFMB-FM\">{{cite news |url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/84544/local-radio-behind-a-paywall/ |last=Venta |first=Lance |title=Local Radio Behind A Paywall |website=RadioInsight |publisher=RadioBB Networks |date=August 8, 2013 |access-date=April 22, 2020 }}</ref> This move by program director Mike O'Reilly drew the ire of fans who live outside the city limits, including the large [[Economy of San Diego#Defense and military|U.S. military community]] stationed locally and overseas.

I understand your frustration and I can assure you this decision to restrict our streaming efforts to San Diego was based on multiple factors including the licensing issues outlined on our website. In addition, radio stations that do not 100% simulcast their signals online are essentially competing with themselves.

They promote themselves as having a larger and more varied playlist than most other commercial radio stations. It is not unusual for a Jack FM station to have a playlist of 700 to 2000 songs, while other FM radio stations may have playlists of fewer than 500 songs. Jack FM stations do not accept song requests from listeners. The format has also been likened to an [[MP3 player]] set on shuffle mode.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2006/07/71362 \"'Imitation iPod' Invades Radio\"]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901082621/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2006/07/71362|date=2010-09-01}}, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', July 13, 2006.</ref>  The stations that have the Jack FM format are in most cases officially classified as \"[[adult hits]]\" or \"variety hits\" by radio research companies.\n\n==Format characteristics==\nStations using the \"Jack\" name are very strictly licensed by SparkNet Communications. There are several terms that the station must agree to, one of them being the fact that [[disc jockeys]] are not to be used for at least the first few months of the format, among other things. SparkNet has also been very protective of its format, unsuccessfully filing [[trademark infringement]] suits against [[Bonneville International]] for its use of the Jack FM \"Playing What We Want\" trademark and other similar phrases. For this reason, many stations using a Jack-like format use slightly different slogans to avoid infringing on SparkNet's service marks: [[WBEN-FM]] in [[Philadelphia]] uses the tagline \"Playing anything we feel like\", for instance. On [[WLKO]] \"102.9 The Lake\" in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], the tagline is \"We Play Anything\". During its run as \"Doug FM\", [[WDRQ]] in [[Detroit]] used the line \"93.1 DOUG FM - We Play...EVERYTHING!\" \n\nJack FM stations in the [[United States]] and Canada use Howard Cogan and Andrew Anthony as the voice of Jack,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howardcogan.com/aboutnew|title=About Howard Cogan|website=howardcogan.com}}</ref> while all Jack FM stations in the [[United Kingdom]] use former [[Blake's 7]] actor [[Paul Darrow]] as the voice of Jack.\n\n==History==\n\n===2000\u20132003: Origins===\nOne of the early originators of the Jack FM format was radio programmer Bob Perry, on a United States-based [[Internet radio]] [[streaming audio|stream]] in 2000. Perry named the station after a fictitious persona, \"Cadillac Jack\" Garrett, \"a hard-living radio cowboy\". The back story created by Perry for the original webstream was that Garrett, a disc jockey who had worked many \"big sticks\", finally got his own radio station and after years of being told what he was to play on-air was creating a station where the motto was \"playing what we want\".  However, according to [[Rogers Communications]], the only thing taken, without permission, for the first Jack FM radio station, in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, was the name and the tagline. Pat Cardinal, one of the first Jack program directors, says that he was unaware of the type of music on the American website and that \"Jack\" was one of several names that were considered for the format. Rogers Communications came to an agreement with Perry for the use of the Jack FM name in Canada soon after the launch. The original webstream is still live to this day.\n\nJack was also inspired by the success of [[CHUM Limited]]'s \"[[Bob FM]]\" brand on [[CFWM]] radio in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba. Program director Howard Kroeger was inspired to create Bob FM after hearing a mix tape at a friend's 40th birthday party. Other Canadian broadcasters copied the concept as well, adopting such brands as [[Corus Entertainment]]'s \"[[CJDV-FM|Dave FM]]\" and \"[[CKNG-FM|Joe FM]]\". In 2003, an [[Ottawa]] station launched \"Frank FM\" as a one-day [[Halloween]] [[prank]]. (The prank's name was possibly also inspired by the Canadian satirical magazine ''[[Frank Magazine|Frank]]'', and probably the [[New England]] station [[Frank FM]].)\n\n[[File:Jackfmcrownlogo.png|thumb|Secondary Jack FM logo, often used on [[Entercom]] stations.]]\nBeginning in late 2002, the format was adopted on Canadian [[radio station]]s owned by [[Rogers Communications]]. The first Jack station was Vancouver's [[CJAX-FM|CKLG-FM]], which quickly shot to the top of the city's [[Bureau of Broadcast Measurement|BBM]] radio ratings. The format was consequently adopted on other Rogers stations in 2002 and 2003. The format proved popular in many markets where it was introduced, although its success was not always as dramatic as it had been in Vancouver.\n\n===2004\u20132005: Introduction to United States and controversies===\nIn 2004, SparkNet Communications, the owner of the Jack FM and \"Playing What We Want\" trademarks outside of Canada, started to license the Jack FM trademark in the United States. NRC Broadcasting's [[KJAC]] in [[Denver]] was the first US station to adopted the \"Jack FM\" format on April 14, 2004. The success of Jack caused a cloning effect, with some stations using the names of famous local figures, landmarks, or symbols to promote their version of the format. These variations have included [[WQQL|WABZ]] \"Abe FM\" in [[Springfield, Illinois]], named for [[Abraham Lincoln]]; [[WBEN-FM]] \"Ben FM\" in [[Philadelphia]], named for [[Benjamin Franklin]]; \"100.5 FM Louie\" in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; \"Doug-FM 93.1\" [[WDRQ]] in [[Detroit]]; \"96.7 Steve FM\" [[WLTY]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], named after [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|University of South Carolina football]] coach [[Steve Spurrier]]; [[WREE|WCFF]] \"The Chief 92.5 FM\" in [[Champaign, Illinois]], named for the controversial symbol of the [[University of Illinois]], [[Chief Illiniwek]]; [[WARH]] in [[St. Louis]], known as \"106.5 [[Gateway Arch|The Arch]]\", or even a body of water like \"106-5 The Lake\" [[WHLK]] in [[Cleveland]], named for [[Lake Erie]].\n\nOn July 29, 2005, [[Rawlco Communications|Rawlco]]'s [[CKCK-FM]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] became the first non-Rogers station in Canada to directly license the Jack FM brand rather than adopting an alternate name.\n\nOn May 4, 2005 at 11 a.m., [[WQSR]], an oldies station in [[Towson, Maryland]] which targeted [[Baltimore]] area listeners, changed its format from oldies to Jack FM. Listeners and staffers alike were surprised by the sudden change because many long-time DJs and on-air personalities were considered a Baltimore institution. WQSR received a large amount of negative publicity regarding the format change. Popular former WQSR personality Steve Rouse has since resurfaced as the new morning show host at sister station, the [[soft adult contemporary]]-formatted [[WLIF]].\n\n[[File:Jack SMALL.png|Logo used on Cumulus and iHeartMedia owned stations.|thumb|right]]\n\nBy far the introduction of Jack FM in [[New York City]] generated the most negative publicity of any market that switched a station to the format. On June 3, 2005 at 5:00&nbsp;p.m., [[WCBS-FM]], an oldies station in New York City, switched to Jack FM without any prior warning. The switch to a more generic format has been termed ''The Day the Music Died'' by some New Yorkers and has drawn criticism even from non-listeners of the station,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/opinion/nyregionopinions/19LIgoldman.html|title=The Day the Music Died|first=Kevin|last=Goldman|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 19, 2005|publisher=}}</ref> particularly due to the sudden firing of DJs of historic renown such as [[Cousin Brucie]]. In a partial nod to this controversy, on June 14, 2005, the station announced that it would tweak the format to include 1950s and early 1960s songs as well as performers such as [[Frank Sinatra]] \u2014 elements not typical of the Jack format. However, a later update retracted this and songs from before the late 1960s were no longer played.\n\nOne prominent reaction to the format change came in the form of a derogatory comment from the city's mayor. According to the ''New York Post'', mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] responded to the change by declaring he would \"never listen to that fucking CBS radio ever again\" (the quote was censored in the newspaper). The new Jack station quickly picked up on this, using its trademark sarcasm: \"Hey, Mayor Bloomberg. I heard you took a shot at us in the ''Post''. What's with all the swearin' like a sailor? [[Fleet Week]] is over. It's just music.\" Initially, [[Arbitron]] ratings showed a sharp decline and while ratings did recover, they never surpassed the levels that WCBS-FM had before the format switch.\n\nAs a result, on July 6, 2007, WCBS-FM announced it would drop Jack FM and restore the station's old format on July 12 with an updated [[classic hits]] approach, a move attributed mostly to the newly appointed CBS Radio CEO Dan Mason.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction%3DArticles.san%26s%3D63620%26Nid%3D32050%26p%3D407397 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-07-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227064523/http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san |archive-date=2007-02-27 }}, Retrieved on 2008/06/12</ref> Three of the fired DJs and staff (Dan Taylor, Bob Shannon, and Mr. G) returned to the station, along with newsman Al Meredith (who had stayed at the station during Jack FM doing his Sunday morning public affairs show), as well as DJ [[Pat St. John]] who had previously left CBS-FM for Q104.3 about a year before the flip to Jack. Steve O'Brien, a weekend and fill-in DJ at the time of the format change, would also return in a similar capacity in 2008. However, the Jack FM format now renamed ToNY is still available through WCBS-FM's HD2 subchannel, and via an internet stream at [http://www.1011hd2.com/ www.1011hd2.com].\n\nOn the same day that WCBS-FM made the switch, another station owned by CBS, [[WBMX (FM)|WJMK]], an oldies station in [[Chicago]], changed formats to Jack FM as well. The change at [[WBMX (FM)|WJMK]] didn't attract as much attention as the change to WCBS, but it still drew the ire of its listeners. The oldies format has since returned to the Chicago airwaves with the introduction of [[WLS-FM|WZZN]] (94.7 FM), in addition to WJMK reverting to [[classic hits]] in 2011.\n\nOn July 5, 2005, it was announced that Bohn & Associates Media and Wall Media formed SparkNet Communications L.P. as the exclusive international licensor and owner of the Jack FM format. SparkNet has, in turn, licensed the format to [[Dial Global]] for satellite-based syndication to stations in U.S. markets outside the 40 largest. This satellite-fed Jack became active in October 2005, and now serves many of the smaller Jack stations, such as those in [[Evansville, Indiana]] and [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].\n\nIn late September 2005, [[CKIS-FM|CJAQ-FM]] in [[Toronto]], announced that it would become the first DJ-free station in Canada. Pat Cardinal, general manager and program director of the station, announced that \"The move came as a result of listener feedback.\" \"The audience has been telling us that they want no DJs on Jack. They want more music.\" When it first launched, 92.5 Jack FM operated without disc jockeys in an effort to establish the \"Playing What We Want\" concept which was new to Toronto. DJs were introduced within weeks. In November 2005, Cardinal defended his decision in an interview with [[Michael Hainsworth]] of [[Report on Business Television]] and stated why he doesn't see commercial-free iPods and satellite radio as a threat to a non-DJ format.<ref>[http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Jack_FM_-_History/id/5173186 History Of Jack FM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408090751/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Jack_FM_-_History/id/5173186 |date=2009-04-08 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2005, [[Entravision Radio]] launched a [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] version of the Jack format dubbed \"Jos\u00e9\" with the \"We Play What We Want\" tagline translated into Spanish as \"Toca lo que Quiere\". \"Jos\u00e9\" went live on six FM and AM stations in [[KRCX-FM|Sacramento]], [[KCVR (AM)|Stockton]], and [[KCVR-FM|Modesto, California]]; [[KRZY (AM)|Albuquerque, New Mexico]]; and [[KMXA (AM)|Denver, Colorado]].<ref>Leila Cobo, \"Jos\u00e9 Is The Latin Jack,\" ''Billboard'', 11/12/2005, Vol. 117 Issue 46, p. 32.</ref> The \"Jos\u00e9\" stations have no affiliation with Jack, SparkNet Communications, or Bob Perry.\n\nOn October 25, 2005, Infinity Broadcasting announced that it would be replacing [[Howard Stern]] with Jack FM on some of its stations. Stern left terrestrial radio for [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] in late 2005.\n\n===2006\u2013present: North American format changes, international expansion===\nFollowing the format's explosive mid-2000s growth throughout North America, Jack FM continued to expand into smaller markets across the continent. However, in many cities the novelty wore off, and in the late 2000s a number of Jack stations modified their playlists drastically or flipped to other formats outright.\n\nIn May 2006, the playlist of [[CKIS-FM|CJAQ-FM]] in [[Toronto]] evolved into a [[mainstream rock]] format. The 1980s [[Top 40 (radio format)|top-40]] acts such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Kim Wilde]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], and [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] were dropped in favor of an all-rock playlist, and the station's slogan changed to \"Toronto's Best Rock Variety. However, In June 2009, the station flipped back to CHR and returned to its former \"Kiss\" branding as well as adopted its current call letters.\"<ref>[http://www.925jackfm.com/ 92.5 JackFM] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410044828/http://www.925jackfm.com/ |date=April 10, 2005 }}</ref> Similarly, Rawlco-owned CKCK-FM (the only non-Rogers operated Jack FM station) in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] adopted a classic rock direction in September, changing its slogan from the traditional \"Playing What We Want\" to \"The Greatest Rock Of All Time\" and adding announcers to its afternoon drive show. In 2010, the tagline was changed again to \"Regina's Greatest Hits\".\n\nIn October 2006, the UK's first Jack FM format station won a broadcast licence for the [[Oxford]] area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2006/10/nr_20061012 |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 13, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930041556/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/media/news/2006/10/nr_20061012 |archive-date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> 106 Jack FM Oxford started broadcasting at 1:06 PM [[British Summer Time|BST]] on October 18, 2007.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} On December 2, 2009, Bristol radio station Original FM changed to Jack FM after requesting a format change with OFCOM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.5428 |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204202439/http://radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.5428 |archive-date=December 4, 2009 }}</ref> Two further Jack FM stations were planned on DAB digital radio from 2008 for Northamptonshire and Northeast Wales and West Cheshire{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} but by August 2009 were a year late with no indication of an [[Estimated time of arrival|ETA]].

In March 2011, WJMK dropped the Jack format in favor of [[classic hits]] as \"K-Hits\", featuring 1960s\u20131980s music. Eddie & Jobo (Ed Volkman and Joe Bohannon, former morning hosts at [[WBBM-FM]]) took over the morning show.\n\nOn June 29, 2012, it was announced that [[KSQN|KJQN]] in Salt Lake City would drop the \"Jack FM\" format on July 16, 2012 and begin to simulcast the talk radio format of [[KLO (AM)|KLO]].<ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/salt-lake-city-standalone-klo-1430-buys-kjqn-fm-1031]{{deadlink|date=March 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2013, [[KFMB-FM]], the Jack FM station in San Diego, began restricting access to its online stream to listeners within the city of San Diego proper.<ref name=\"RI 2013-08-08 KFMB-FM\">{{cite news |url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/84544/local-radio-behind-a-paywall/ |last=Venta |first=Lance |title=Local Radio Behind A Paywall |website=RadioInsight |publisher=RadioBB Networks |date=August 8, 2013 |access-date=April 22, 2020 }}</ref> This move by program director Mike O'Reilly drew the ire of fans who live outside the city limits, including the large [[Economy of San Diego#Defense and military|U.S. military community]] stationed locally and overseas. O'Reilly explained his rationale, citing a new [[Arbitron]] policy on how online listening is measured:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Our radio industry is continually adapting to changing metrics, which are sometimes out of our control within our competitive landscape. I understand your frustration and I can assure you this decision to restrict our streaming efforts to San Diego was based on multiple factors including the licensing issues outlined on our website. In addition, radio stations that do not 100% simulcast their signals online are essentially competing with themselves. Technically they are considered two separate radio stations in the way they are rated. By restricting our signal to San Diego only, our online stream and our air signal at 100.7FM will be considered one unified station.\n|author=Mike O'Reilly, KFMB-FM program director\n}}\n\nKFMB-FM achieved this effect by restricting the signal based on the IP address of the device on which a listener streamed the station. However, fans within the city of San Diego were prevented from hearing the station as well. In addition, the station charged for access to its local morning radio show on podcast in September 2013.<ref name=\"RI 2013-08-08 KFMB-FM\" /> On November 17, 2015, KFMB-FM dropped its regular Jack FM programming and began [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with all-Christmas music as \"Jack Frost\"; the station launched a [[mainstream rock]] format on January 4, 2016.<ref name=\"RI 2016-01-04 KFMB-FM\">{{cite news |url=https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/95651/wheel-of-formats-kills-off-jack-fm-san-diego/ |last=Venta |first=Lance |title=Wheel of Formats Kills Off Jack-FM San Diego |website=RadioInsight |publisher=RadioBB Networks |date=January 4, 2016 |access-date=October 28, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nOn February 28, 2014, [[CFLT-FM]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] flipped formats to Jack FM becoming the latest Rogers radio station to adopt the Jack branding.

That station, however, returned to Jack FM programming on August 15, 2019.\n\nOn December 26, 2017 at midnight, [[KSAJ-FM]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]] flipped formats from oldies to Jack FM.\n\nThe Jack FM format is distributed via satellite in the United States and internationally.

Nina is being sexually harassed in a job she had no choice but to take after having failed a college interview. Lulu, Jip's best female friend and \"dropping partner\", has suffered infidelity in her last 3 relationships. Moff, the newest member of the group having met Jip at a warehouse party after moving from [[London]] to Cardiff, is an unemployed [[slacker]] who scrapes a living as a small-time dealer, despite his father being a senior policeman. The five friends become very close, take drugs such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] and [[cocaine]], and \"live for the weekend\".\n\nThe film follows the exploits of the five friends as well as various characters they meet along the way. They go to pubs and clubs on Friday, taking along Nina's 17-year-old brother Lee whose waning enthusiasm for his first drugs experience is played out in a cameo debate between Jip and a doctor. Jip gives up his ticket to Lulu, whom he has talked into coming out and is forced to talk his way into the club as the group are a ticket short. The club scene is then examined through a series of cameos including two attempts by older journalists to understand the club scene. The ensemble then joins a [[house party]], where Lulu and Jip finally kiss and attempt unsuccessfully to make love; whereas the established couple, Koop and Nina, argue over Koop's perceptions about her behaviour. Later, as expected by the group, \"what goes up must come down\" sets in as the effects of their drug use begin to hit home leaving them coping with feelings of illness and paranoia. They recover Lee from a group of younger partygoers he has spent the night with and make their way home.\n\nOn returning home, some of the group's issues are resolved whilst some are thrown into sharper relief. Jip makes love to Lulu, overcoming his sexual paranoia. Koop and Nina's issues are set aside. Lee has made it through the weekend without any of his concerns being realised.  Moff, however, is still caught up in the paranoia caused by his extensive drug use. He argues with his parents again and is seen walking alone around Cardiff looking disheartened. However, Moff joins his friends for an end of the weekend drink and having raged about his difficulties with drugs is soon joking about his excesses with his friends. The film finishes with Jip and Lulu kissing in the street in the manner of classic Hollywood films.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Simm]] as Jip\n* [[Lorraine Pilkington]] as Lulu\n* [[Shaun Parkes]] as Koop\n* [[Danny Dyer]] as Moff\n* [[Nicola Reynolds]] as Nina\n* [[Andrew Lincoln]] as Felix\n* Dean Davies as Lee\n* [[Richard Coyle]] as Andy\n\n==Cameo appearances==\n*When Jip first picks up Koop in his car, the DJ heard on the radio is [[Pete Tong]], the film's musical adviser,<ref name=\"BBC\"/> who has a weekly Friday night radio show on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref name=\"Pete Tong\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v|title=BBC Official Website \u2013 Pete Tong|accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref>\n*\"Pablo Hassan\", manager of the Asylum club, is played by prominent DJ [[Carl Cox]].<ref name=\"DVD\"/><ref name=\"CarlCox\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.carlcox.com/|title=Carl Cox Official Website|accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref>\n*Director Kerrigan appears in several scenes as \"Ziggy Marlon\",<ref name=\"IMDB1\"/> the [[Jungle music|Junglist dancer]] in Koop's record shop who asks, \"Any jungle in, guy?\", as an early aficianado of 'TomToms', the precursor to the Asylum club, (the main club venue for the film), and in a later scene driving with Nina's brother on their way to the house party, as well as several other brief appearances throughout the film.

Kerrigan based much of the film on his own exploits,<ref name=\"GuardianReview\"/> and eventually took over in a director capacity. In an edition of UK [[gay]] lifestyle magazine ''[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]'', actor [[Danny Dyer]] spoke about the film being partly inspired by the 1995 [[BBC]] [[television drama]] ''[[Loved Up]]'' (which also featured an early appearance from [[Lena Headey]]), and which had similar themes to the film.\n\n===Locations===\nMuch of the film was shot in [[Cardiff]], where the film also takes place. Nina's workplace, a fictionalised [[McDonald's]], was filmed at UCI 12 Cinemas (Now an Odeon Cinema), Atlantic Wharf Leisure Village, Hemingway Road. The public house during the Friday night scene was shot at the Firedrake & Firkin Pub, 39-41 Salisbury Road, Cathays, Cardiff. The Emporium nightclub on Cardiff High Street was used as the exterior of the fictional \"Asylum\" club, and the former Club X, Charles Street stood in as the interior. The Philharmonic public house on St Mary's Street is where the Sunday pub scene was filmed, and Jip and Lulu's Sunday night walk home was also filmed in St Mary's Street.<ref name=\"CardiffLocations\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188674/locations|title=Human Traffic (1999)|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Alienation===\nInter-generation alienation is a significant theme of the film including being directly referenced in a pub scene in which the main, minor and bit players sing a revised version of the [[United Kingdom]] national anthem 38 minutes into the film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> Many of the characters have family troubles which cause conflict with family members. Jip's mother is a prostitute; Koop's father lives in a fantasy world under residential psychiatric care since his wife left him. Moff still lives at home and is shown as being in continual tension with his father and embarrassed when he is caught masturbating by his mother. The family relationships of the female leads are explored in less detail, although one scene portrays Lulu giving only limited details of her weekend to an uncle and aunt who are dressed as clergy. At least one contemporary review suggests that these relationships are not adequately explored in the film.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\n===Work and unemployment===\nThe film is also indifferent to the work ethic. Jip works at a clothing retail outlet and is comedically represented as a '[[wage slavery|wage slave]]'; particularly in a scene where he is shown being anally raped by his boss, who has a barcode on his forehead and forcibly covers Jip's mouth with a \u00a320 note. Nina has similar misgivings about her job at a fast-food restaurant where all the employees are shown bodypopping robotically and she quits her work following sexual harassment. Moff argues with his father about preferring to be unemployed whilst Lulu is shown not enjoying her college experience.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Drugs and the counter culture===\nAll the characters identify strongly with the 1990s counter-culture: all are drug users to a greater or lesser extent; Jip idolises [[Bill Hicks]]; Koop dreams of being a DJ; Moff's bedroom is festooned with anti-establishment posters. Lulu gives an extended speech about her individuality whilst Nina revels in becoming unemployed.\n\nJip concludes his narration by saying \"We're all fucked up in our own way, y'know, but we're all doing it together. We're freestylin' on the buckle wheel of life, trapped in a world of internal dialogue. Like Bill Hicks said: 'It's an insane world, but I'm proud to be part of it.'\"\n\nAlthough there is significant dialogue about drug use contained in the film (specifically [[MDMA]] (ecstasy), [[marijuana]], and one sarcastic discussion about [[heroin]] and [[crack cocaine]]), the only drug use by main characters is a scene where Jip and Koop are having an intimate conversation at a house party and they are seen cutting up a line of white powder. They are never actually shown snorting it, but nonchalantly rub it into their gums during a discussion. Later at the same party Nina and Lulu are seen sharing a spliff on a balcony and Ernie, one of the protagonist's in Howard Marks' monologue 'Spliff Politics' is also seen smoking a large spliff.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film generated mixed reviews, garnering 59% positive reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/human_traffic|title=Human Traffic (2000)|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> Film critic Colm Keaveny proclaimed this film to be Danny Dyer's \"finest hour\", and [[Irish people|Irish]] critic James Murphy called Dyer's performance \"truly remarkable\". The film garnered 11 international awards and was nominated for a BAFTA.<ref name=\"Guardian2\"/> [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film two and a half stars, describing it as \"a writer\u2019s film if there ever was one\".<ref>{{cite book | last=Maltin | first=Leonard | year=2009 | page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780451227645/page/511 511] | title=Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide | url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780451227645 | url-access=registration | isbn=978-1-101-10660-0 | publisher=Signet Books }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Human Traffic (soundtrack)}}\nAn important part of this film is the soundtrack; which includes some of the most famous contemporary dance music producers of the time. These include [[Armand Van Helden]], [[CJ Bolland]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Jacknife Lee]], [[Pete Heller]], [[Ferry Corsten]], [[Carl Cox]], [[Dillinja]], [[Felix Da Housecat]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], [[Aphrodite (artist)|Aphrodite]], [[Death in Vegas]], [[Primal Scream]], [[Liquid Child]], [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]], [[Age of Love (song)|The Age Of Love]], [[Energy 52]], [[Brainbug]] and [[Lucid (band)|Lucid]]. The incidental music and scratching from the scene 'Puffin' the Herb' was by [[Mad Doctor X]]\n\n==American version==\nThe version of the film released in the United States was heavily edited to remove certain British cultural references and terminology that it was presumably felt American audiences would be unable to identify with or understand. These are mostly in the form of re-dubbed dialogue, such as Jip saying that he and Lulu \"recently became dropping partners\" being changed to \"clubbing partners\"; Nina's speech to the journalists in which she says she is looking forward to getting into some \"hardcore [[This Morning (TV series)|Richard and Judy]]\" becoming \"hardcore ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]''\"; and Jip's allusion to ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' with \"he who dares, Rodders,\" being rendered as \"he [[Who Dares Wins|who dares wins]]\".\n\nOther material was simply cut, including Lulu dumping her boyfriend; most of Koop's conversation with his father in the [[psychiatric hospital]]; and the 1991 \"Summer of Love\" flashback sequence. As a result of various cuts, the US version runs to 84m 14s, compared to the original 99m 21s, losing just over 15 minutes of footage, in addition to the numerous re-dubs. Certain scenes also feature different music from the original UK version.\n\n==''Human Traffic Remixed''==\nOn 21 October 2002, distributors [[2 Entertain|VCI]] announced the DVD release of ''Human Traffic Remixed'', promising a \"modernised\" soundtrack with new contemporary (2002) tracks, previously cut scenes, and \"state-of-the-art [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects.\" On 18 October ''The Guardian'' revealed that rather than being a \"[[director's cut]]\", it was the work of producer [[Allan Niblo]], Kerrigan's tutor and \"mentor\" at film school. Niblo removed from the titles all shots of the 1994 anti-[[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice and Public Order Act]] demonstration and subsequent riot, thus eliminating the implicit political element of the original. He also cut the more anti-royalist second verse of the spoof national anthem, and all references to Moff, played by Dyer, being a casual drug dealer. Dyer went on to star in other Niblo produced films, notably ''[[The Football Factory (film)|The Football Factory]]''. He added scenes about Jip's internal struggles over his mother's prostitution, and another where the female leads play aliens, creating a film slightly less concerned with the politics and active promulgation of the Class-A Ecstasy & MDMA drug culture endemic in the 1990s, and more about coming of age struggles informed by a passive participation in it.\n\nKerrigan only learnt about the project two weeks before the release was due.<ref name=\"Kamera\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kamera.co.uk/reviews_extra/human_traffic.php|title=Kamera Review \u2013 Human Traffic|accessdate=2010-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504064656/http://www.kamera.co.uk/reviews_extra/human_traffic.php|archive-date=4 May 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> He explained: \"I joke about it. How I signed over the copyright (to Niblo) for a pound and then never even saw the pound. When I finished I was \u00a325,000 in debt. I've never made a penny from the film. Legally I don't have a leg to stand on, but I signed the contract because I was very naive and very broke. Now I'm just broke.\" No longer able to afford living in London, where he had moved after the film's release, Kerrigan was preparing to return to his native Cardiff. Although shot on a budget of \u00a3340,000 and UK box office taking of \u00a32.5 million, Niblo maintained that the film had not made a profit, stating: \"the investment is still unrecouped.\" John Simm was highly critical of the new release, describing it as \"cynical exploitation\" and complained of Niblo's attempts to get him to appear in a [[sequel]] when he had only been paid a nominal fee for the first film. Simm said that he only appeared in ''Human Traffic'' because of Kerrigan's involvement.<ref name=\"Guardian2\"/> While the original 99m 21s cinema version runs to 95m 21s on video<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/human-traffic-2|title=HUMAN TRAFFIC &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=www.bbfc.co.uk}}</ref> due to [[576i#PAL speed-up|PAL speed-up]], the ''Remixed'' version runs to 95m 30s<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/human-traffic-remixed-2002-0|title=HUMAN TRAFFIC REMIXED &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=www.bbfc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Loved Up|Loved Up (1995 film)]]'', a BBC TV drama exploring clubbing and drug culture\n*''[[Go (1999 film)|Go]]'', a US film about rave culture released the same year\n*''[[Groove (film)]]'', a US film about rave culture released a year later\n*''[[Sorted (film)]]'', a UK film about trance culture released a year later\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.miramax.com/movie/human-traffic}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0188674}}\n* {{Amg movie|180287|Human Traffic}}\n\n{{Media in Cardiff}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1990s comedy films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British comedy films]]\n[[Category:Cool Cymru]]\n[[Category:Films about drugs]]\n[[Category:Films set in Cardiff]]\n[[Category:Films set in Wales]]\n[[Category:Irish comedy films]]\n[[Category:Irish films]]\n[[Category:Vertigo Films films]]\n[[Category:Stoner films]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the film|The [[Page 44]] song|Human Traffic (song)|The human rights issue|human trafficking}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2012}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = Human Traffic\n| image = Human Traffic poster.JPG\n| caption = US release poster\n| director = [[Justin Kerrigan]]\n| producer = [[Allan Niblo]]<br />Emer McCourt<br />Renata S.

Jip is suffering from sexual anxiety brought on by a series of unsuccessful liaisons.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/03/16/human_traffic_1999_review.shtml|title=BBC (UK TV Station) Film Reviews: March 2001|accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref><ref name=\"IMDBQuotes\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188674/quotes|title=IMDB Film Database \u2013 Human Traffic Memorable Quotes|accessdate=2010-01-11}}</ref> Koop, Jip's best friend, is jealous of his girlfriend Nina's popular and happy-go-lucky nature. Nina is being sexually harassed in a job she had no choice but to take after having failed a college interview. Lulu, Jip's best female friend and \"dropping partner\", has suffered infidelity in her last 3 relationships. Moff, the newest member of the group having met Jip at a warehouse party after moving from [[London]] to Cardiff, is an unemployed [[slacker]] who scrapes a living as a small-time dealer, despite his father being a senior policeman. The five friends become very close, take drugs such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] and [[cocaine]], and \"live for the weekend\".\n\nThe film follows the exploits of the five friends as well as various characters they meet along the way. They go to pubs and clubs on Friday, taking along Nina's 17-year-old brother Lee whose waning enthusiasm for his first drugs experience is played out in a cameo debate between Jip and a doctor. Jip gives up his ticket to Lulu, whom he has talked into coming out and is forced to talk his way into the club as the group are a ticket short. The club scene is then examined through a series of cameos including two attempts by older journalists to understand the club scene. The ensemble then joins a [[house party]], where Lulu and Jip finally kiss and attempt unsuccessfully to make love; whereas the established couple, Koop and Nina, argue over Koop's perceptions about her behaviour. Later, as expected by the group, \"what goes up must come down\" sets in as the effects of their drug use begin to hit home leaving them coping with feelings of illness and paranoia. They recover Lee from a group of younger partygoers he has spent the night with and make their way home.\n\nOn returning home, some of the group's issues are resolved whilst some are thrown into sharper relief. Jip makes love to Lulu, overcoming his sexual paranoia. Koop and Nina's issues are set aside. Lee has made it through the weekend without any of his concerns being realised.  Moff, however, is still caught up in the paranoia caused by his extensive drug use. He argues with his parents again and is seen walking alone around Cardiff looking disheartened. However, Moff joins his friends for an end of the weekend drink and having raged about his difficulties with drugs is soon joking about his excesses with his friends. The film finishes with Jip and Lulu kissing in the street in the manner of classic Hollywood films.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Simm]] as Jip\n* [[Lorraine Pilkington]] as Lulu\n* [[Shaun Parkes]] as Koop\n* [[Danny Dyer]] as Moff\n* [[Nicola Reynolds]] as Nina\n* [[Andrew Lincoln]] as Felix\n* Dean Davies as Lee\n* [[Richard Coyle]] as Andy\n\n==Cameo appearances==\n*When Jip first picks up Koop in his car, the DJ heard on the radio is [[Pete Tong]], the film's musical adviser,<ref name=\"BBC\"/> who has a weekly Friday night radio show on [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref name=\"Pete Tong\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v|title=BBC Official Website \u2013 Pete Tong|accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref>\n*\"Pablo Hassan\", manager of the Asylum club, is played by prominent DJ [[Carl Cox]].<ref name=\"DVD\"/><ref name=\"CarlCox\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.carlcox.com/|title=Carl Cox Official Website|accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref>\n*Director Kerrigan appears in several scenes as \"Ziggy Marlon\",<ref name=\"IMDB1\"/> the [[Jungle music|Junglist dancer]] in Koop's record shop who asks, \"Any jungle in, guy?\", as an early aficianado of 'TomToms', the precursor to the Asylum club, (the main club venue for the film), and in a later scene driving with Nina's brother on their way to the house party, as well as several other brief appearances throughout the film.

Kerrigan based much of the film on his own exploits,<ref name=\"GuardianReview\"/> and eventually took over in a director capacity. In an edition of UK [[gay]] lifestyle magazine ''[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]'', actor [[Danny Dyer]] spoke about the film being partly inspired by the 1995 [[BBC]] [[television drama]] ''[[Loved Up]]'' (which also featured an early appearance from [[Lena Headey]]), and which had similar themes to the film.\n\n===Locations===\nMuch of the film was shot in [[Cardiff]], where the film also takes place. Nina's workplace, a fictionalised [[McDonald's]], was filmed at UCI 12 Cinemas (Now an Odeon Cinema), Atlantic Wharf Leisure Village, Hemingway Road. The public house during the Friday night scene was shot at the Firedrake & Firkin Pub, 39-41 Salisbury Road, Cathays, Cardiff. The Emporium nightclub on Cardiff High Street was used as the exterior of the fictional \"Asylum\" club, and the former Club X, Charles Street stood in as the interior. The Philharmonic public house on St Mary's Street is where the Sunday pub scene was filmed, and Jip and Lulu's Sunday night walk home was also filmed in St Mary's Street.<ref name=\"CardiffLocations\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188674/locations|title=Human Traffic (1999)|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Alienation===\nInter-generation alienation is a significant theme of the film including being directly referenced in a pub scene in which the main, minor and bit players sing a revised version of the [[United Kingdom]] national anthem 38 minutes into the film.<ref name=\"DVD\"/> Many of the characters have family troubles which cause conflict with family members. Jip's mother is a prostitute; Koop's father lives in a fantasy world under residential psychiatric care since his wife left him. Moff still lives at home and is shown as being in continual tension with his father and embarrassed when he is caught masturbating by his mother. The family relationships of the female leads are explored in less detail, although one scene portrays Lulu giving only limited details of her weekend to an uncle and aunt who are dressed as clergy. At least one contemporary review suggests that these relationships are not adequately explored in the film.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\n===Work and unemployment===\nThe film is also indifferent to the work ethic. Jip works at a clothing retail outlet and is comedically represented as a '[[wage slavery|wage slave]]'; particularly in a scene where he is shown being anally raped by his boss, who has a barcode on his forehead and forcibly covers Jip's mouth with a \u00a320 note. Nina has similar misgivings about her job at a fast-food restaurant where all the employees are shown bodypopping robotically and she quits her work following sexual harassment. Moff argues with his father about preferring to be unemployed whilst Lulu is shown not enjoying her college experience.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n===Drugs and the counter culture===\nAll the characters identify strongly with the 1990s counter-culture: all are drug users to a greater or lesser extent; Jip idolises [[Bill Hicks]]; Koop dreams of being a DJ; Moff's bedroom is festooned with anti-establishment posters. Lulu gives an extended speech about her individuality whilst Nina revels in becoming unemployed.\n\nJip concludes his narration by saying \"We're all fucked up in our own way, y'know, but we're all doing it together. We're freestylin' on the buckle wheel of life, trapped in a world of internal dialogue. Like Bill Hicks said: 'It's an insane world, but I'm proud to be part of it.'\"\n\nAlthough there is significant dialogue about drug use contained in the film (specifically [[MDMA]] (ecstasy), [[marijuana]], and one sarcastic discussion about [[heroin]] and [[crack cocaine]]), the only drug use by main characters is a scene where Jip and Koop are having an intimate conversation at a house party and they are seen cutting up a line of white powder. They are never actually shown snorting it, but nonchalantly rub it into their gums during a discussion. Later at the same party Nina and Lulu are seen sharing a spliff on a balcony and Ernie, one of the protagonist's in Howard Marks' monologue 'Spliff Politics' is also seen smoking a large spliff.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film generated mixed reviews, garnering 59% positive reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/human_traffic|title=Human Traffic (2000)|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> Film critic Colm Keaveny proclaimed this film to be Danny Dyer's \"finest hour\", and [[Irish people|Irish]] critic James Murphy called Dyer's performance \"truly remarkable\". The film garnered 11 international awards and was nominated for a BAFTA.<ref name=\"Guardian2\"/> [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film two and a half stars, describing it as \"a writer\u2019s film if there ever was one\".<ref>{{cite book | last=Maltin | first=Leonard | year=2009 | page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780451227645/page/511 511] | title=Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide | url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780451227645 | url-access=registration | isbn=978-1-101-10660-0 | publisher=Signet Books }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Main|Human Traffic (soundtrack)}}\nAn important part of this film is the soundtrack; which includes some of the most famous contemporary dance music producers of the time. These include [[Armand Van Helden]], [[CJ Bolland]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Jacknife Lee]], [[Pete Heller]], [[Ferry Corsten]], [[Carl Cox]], [[Dillinja]], [[Felix Da Housecat]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], [[Aphrodite (artist)|Aphrodite]], [[Death in Vegas]], [[Primal Scream]], [[Liquid Child]], [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]], [[Age of Love (song)|The Age Of Love]], [[Energy 52]], [[Brainbug]] and [[Lucid (band)|Lucid]]. The incidental music and scratching from the scene 'Puffin' the Herb' was by [[Mad Doctor X]]\n\n==American version==\nThe version of the film released in the United States was heavily edited to remove certain British cultural references and terminology that it was presumably felt American audiences would be unable to identify with or understand. These are mostly in the form of re-dubbed dialogue, such as Jip saying that he and Lulu \"recently became dropping partners\" being changed to \"clubbing partners\"; Nina's speech to the journalists in which she says she is looking forward to getting into some \"hardcore [[This Morning (TV series)|Richard and Judy]]\" becoming \"hardcore ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]''\"; and Jip's allusion to ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' with \"he who dares, Rodders,\" being rendered as \"he [[Who Dares Wins|who dares wins]]\".\n\nOther material was simply cut, including Lulu dumping her boyfriend; most of Koop's conversation with his father in the [[psychiatric hospital]]; and the 1991 \"Summer of Love\" flashback sequence. As a result of various cuts, the US version runs to 84m 14s, compared to the original 99m 21s, losing just over 15 minutes of footage, in addition to the numerous re-dubs. Certain scenes also feature different music from the original UK version.\n\n==''Human Traffic Remixed''==\nOn 21 October 2002, distributors [[2 Entertain|VCI]] announced the DVD release of ''Human Traffic Remixed'', promising a \"modernised\" soundtrack with new contemporary (2002) tracks, previously cut scenes, and \"state-of-the-art [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects.\" On 18 October ''The Guardian'' revealed that rather than being a \"[[director's cut]]\", it was the work of producer [[Allan Niblo]], Kerrigan's tutor and \"mentor\" at film school. Niblo removed from the titles all shots of the 1994 anti-[[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice and Public Order Act]] demonstration and subsequent riot, thus eliminating the implicit political element of the original. He also cut the more anti-royalist second verse of the spoof national anthem, and all references to Moff, played by Dyer, being a casual drug dealer. Dyer went on to star in other Niblo produced films, notably ''[[The Football Factory (film)|The Football Factory]]''. He added scenes about Jip's internal struggles over his mother's prostitution, and another where the female leads play aliens, creating a film slightly less concerned with the politics and active promulgation of the Class-A Ecstasy & MDMA drug culture endemic in the 1990s, and more about coming of age struggles informed by a passive participation in it.\n\nKerrigan only learnt about the project two weeks before the release was due.<ref name=\"Kamera\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kamera.co.uk/reviews_extra/human_traffic.php|title=Kamera Review \u2013 Human Traffic|accessdate=2010-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504064656/http://www.kamera.co.uk/reviews_extra/human_traffic.php|archive-date=4 May 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> He explained: \"I joke about it. How I signed over the copyright (to Niblo) for a pound and then never even saw the pound. When I finished I was \u00a325,000 in debt. I've never made a penny from the film. Legally I don't have a leg to stand on, but I signed the contract because I was very naive and very broke. Now I'm just broke.\" No longer able to afford living in London, where he had moved after the film's release, Kerrigan was preparing to return to his native Cardiff. Although shot on a budget of \u00a3340,000 and UK box office taking of \u00a32.5 million, Niblo maintained that the film had not made a profit, stating: \"the investment is still unrecouped.\" John Simm was highly critical of the new release, describing it as \"cynical exploitation\" and complained of Niblo's attempts to get him to appear in a [[sequel]] when he had only been paid a nominal fee for the first film. Simm said that he only appeared in ''Human Traffic'' because of Kerrigan's involvement.<ref name=\"Guardian2\"/> While the original 99m 21s cinema version runs to 95m 21s on video<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/human-traffic-2|title=HUMAN TRAFFIC &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=www.bbfc.co.uk}}</ref> due to [[576i#PAL speed-up|PAL speed-up]], the ''Remixed'' version runs to 95m 30s<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/human-traffic-remixed-2002-0|title=HUMAN TRAFFIC REMIXED &#124; British Board of Film Classification|website=www.bbfc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Loved Up|Loved Up (1995 film)]]'', a BBC TV drama exploring clubbing and drug culture\n*''[[Go (1999 film)|Go]]'', a US film about rave culture released the same year\n*''[[Groove (film)]]'', a US film about rave culture released a year later\n*''[[Sorted (film)]]'', a UK film about trance culture released a year later\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.miramax.com/movie/human-traffic}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0188674}}\n* {{Amg movie|180287|Human Traffic}}\n\n{{Media in Cardiff}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n\n[[Category:1999 films]]\n[[Category:1990s comedy films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British comedy films]]\n[[Category:Cool Cymru]]\n[[Category:Films about drugs]]\n[[Category:Films set in Cardiff]]\n[[Category:Films set in Wales]]\n[[Category:Irish comedy films]]\n[[Category:Irish films]]\n[[Category:Vertigo Films films]]\n[[Category:Stoner films]]\n", "name_user": "TMProofreader", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Traffic"}
