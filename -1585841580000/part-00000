It distributes fuel to more than 7,300 Sunoco-branded gas stations, almost all of which are owned and operated by third parties. The partnership is controlled by [[Energy Transfer Partners]].<ref name=10K/>\n\nThe partnership was formerly known as '''Sun Company Inc.''' (1886\u20131920 and 1976\u20131998) and '''Sun Oil Co.''' (1920\u20131976). It was formerly engaged in [[oil refinery]], the [[chemical industry]], and retail sales, but divested these businesses.\n\n==History==\n===1800s to 1950s: founding and growth===\n[[File:1920 Sunoco motor oil newspaper ad.png|thumbnail|left|Newspaper ad for Sunoco motor oil, then known as Sun Oil ''[[Tulsa Daily World]]'' (November 1, 1922)]]\nThe partnership began as The Peoples Natural Gas Company in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. In 1886, its partners \u2013 [[Joseph Newton Pew]], Philip Pisano, and Edward O. Emerson \u2013 decided to expand their gas business with a stake in the new oil discoveries in [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. Four years later, the growing enterprise became the Sun Oil Company of Ohio. Sun Oil diversified quickly, active in production and distribution of oil as well as processing and marketing refined products. By 1901, the company was incorporated in [[New Jersey]] as Sun Company and turned its interest to the new [[Spindletop]] field in [[Texas]]. Pew's sons, [[J. Howard Pew]] and [[Joseph N. Pew Jr.]] would take over the company after their father's death.\n\nWith a growing portfolio of oil fields and refineries, Sun opened its first service station in [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania]] in 1920. In 1922, it changed its name back to Sun Oil Company and, in 1925, it became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]] on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. Sunoco ranked 39th among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] production contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p. 620</ref> Sun expanded internationally following the war. Its first Canadian refinery was built in 1953 in [[Sarnia, Ontario]], home to a burgeoning new [[petrochemical industry]]. Sun established a facility at Venezuela's [[Lake Maracaibo]] in 1957, which produced over a billion barrels (160,000,000 m<sup>3</sup>) before the operation was [[nationalized]] in 1975.\n\n====Custom blending====\nIn 1956, Sunoco introduced \"custom blending\" pumps, an innovation that allowed customers of Sunoco service stations to choose from several [[octane rating]]s through a single pump.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Sunoco stations offered as many as eight grades of \"Custom Blended\" gasolines from its \"Dial A Grade\" pumps ranging from subregular Sunoco 190 to Sunoco 260, the latter a super-premium grade of 102 octane that was advertised as the \"highest octane pump gas\" and very popular with operators of [[V8 engine|V8]]-powered [[muscle cars]] of the 1960s.<ref>{{cite news | title=America's six finest gasoline grades custom-blended to fit any car today | url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/68232358/ | work=Shamokin News-Dispatch |location=Shamokin, Penn. | date=July 2, 1958 |url-access=subscription |postscript=.

In the late 1980s, Sun began rebranding DX stations in the Midwest to the Sunoco brand and even introduced the high-octane Sunoco ULTRA 94 gasoline to stations in that region, but by the early 1990s, they pulled out of virtually all areas in the southeastern U.S. and west of the Mississippi, resulting in the closing and rebranding of service stations and jobbers to other brands in those areas, notably [[Sinclair Oil|Sinclair]] in Oklahoma. Ironically enough, they also at this time offered Economy 86, which was the lowest commercially available gasoline at the time.\n\nWith increased diversification, Sun Oil Company was renamed Sun Company in 1976. In 1980, Sun acquired the U.S. oil and gas properties of '''Texas Pacific Oil Company, Inc.''', a subsidiary of The [[Seagram]] Company, Ltd., for US$2.3 billion\u2014the second largest acquisition in U.S. history to that date.\n\nThrough the 1980s, Sun developed oil interests in the [[North Sea]] and offshore [[China]] and expanded its holdings in both oil and coal with additional U.S. business acquisitions. In 1983, consumers saw the arrival of Sunoco ULTRA 94, the market's highest octane unleaded gasoline. Then in 1988, Sun undertook a major restructuring to segregate its domestic oil and gas exploration and production business and the focus the company on its refining and marketing business. This led to the acquisition of [[Atlantic Refining and Marketing]] (and, in effect, that company's [[convenience store]] chain, [[A-Plus]]), including its Philadelphia refinery which was later merged with the former [[Gulf Oil]] refinery next door that Sunoco acquired from [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]].\n\nBy the 1990s, Sun had departed the international exploration business and was fully dedicated to its branded products and services. In 1994, Sunoco acquired the Philadelphia [[Chevron Oil]] refinery consolidating operations with its own adjacent which it had acquired with Atlantic. Sun sold its remaining interest in Canada's [[Suncor Energy]] in 1995, but markets product from two refineries \u2013 one in [[Toledo, Ohio]], and the other [[Sarnia, Ontario]] \u2013 in joint ventures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunocochem.com/products/sarniaf.htm |title=Sunoco Chemicals and the Sarnia Refinery |publisher=Sunocochem.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref> In 1998, Sun Company, Inc. became Sunoco, Inc.

In 1886, its partners \u2013 [[Joseph Newton Pew]], Philip Pisano, and Edward O. Emerson \u2013 decided to expand their gas business with a stake in the new oil discoveries in [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. Four years later, the growing enterprise became the Sun Oil Company of Ohio. Sun Oil diversified quickly, active in production and distribution of oil as well as processing and marketing refined products. By 1901, the company was incorporated in [[New Jersey]] as Sun Company and turned its interest to the new [[Spindletop]] field in [[Texas]]. Pew's sons, [[J. Howard Pew]] and [[Joseph N. Pew Jr.]] would take over the company after their father's death.\n\nWith a growing portfolio of oil fields and refineries, Sun opened its first service station in [[Ardmore, Pennsylvania]] in 1920. In 1922, it changed its name back to Sun Oil Company and, in 1925, it became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]] on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. Sunoco ranked 39th among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] production contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M.

Its first Canadian refinery was built in 1953 in [[Sarnia, Ontario]], home to a burgeoning new [[petrochemical industry]].

In the late 1980s, Sun began rebranding DX stations in the Midwest to the Sunoco brand and even introduced the high-octane Sunoco ULTRA 94 gasoline to stations in that region, but by the early 1990s, they pulled out of virtually all areas in the southeastern U.S. and west of the Mississippi, resulting in the closing and rebranding of service stations and jobbers to other brands in those areas, notably [[Sinclair Oil|Sinclair]] in Oklahoma. Ironically enough, they also at this time offered Economy 86, which was the lowest commercially available gasoline at the time.\n\nWith increased diversification, Sun Oil Company was renamed Sun Company in 1976. In 1980, Sun acquired the U.S. oil and gas properties of '''Texas Pacific Oil Company, Inc.''', a subsidiary of The [[Seagram]] Company, Ltd., for US$2.3 billion\u2014the second largest acquisition in U.S. history to that date.\n\nThrough the 1980s, Sun developed oil interests in the [[North Sea]] and offshore [[China]] and expanded its holdings in both oil and coal with additional U.S. business acquisitions. In 1983, consumers saw the arrival of Sunoco ULTRA 94, the market's highest octane unleaded gasoline. Then in 1988, Sun undertook a major restructuring to segregate its domestic oil and gas exploration and production business and the focus the company on its refining and marketing business. This led to the acquisition of [[Atlantic Refining and Marketing]] (and, in effect, that company's [[convenience store]] chain, [[A-Plus]]), including its Philadelphia refinery which was later merged with the former [[Gulf Oil]] refinery next door that Sunoco acquired from [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]].\n\nBy the 1990s, Sun had departed the international exploration business and was fully dedicated to its branded products and services. In 1994, Sunoco acquired the Philadelphia [[Chevron Oil]] refinery consolidating operations with its own adjacent which it had acquired with Atlantic.

From October 2006 until October 2010, he was the chairman of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] committee for judicial issues. When the new parliament, that was elected in 2010, was inaugurated, Bodstr\u00f6m lost his position as a committee chairman. Bodstr\u00f6m shortly afterwards requested half-time leave of absence from his seat in the parliament, combined with half-time parental leave, in order to relocate to the USA together with his family. His request for leave of absence was denied by the Social Democratic group leader in the parliament, and Bodstr\u00f6m has thus left his seat in the Parliament.

In his youth, however, Thomas Bodstr\u00f6m was not involved in party politics. Instead, his first brush with media attention came as a [[association football|football]] player in [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], a team in the [[Allsvenskan|Premier Division of the Swedish Football league]], 1987\u20131989. In 1990, he graduated from [[Stockholm University]] with a Bachelor of Laws degree. After that, he worked as a lawyer for ten years. During his career, he took interest in international affairs, and in 1999, he joined the board of the Swedish branch of the international organisation [[Lawyers Without Borders]].\n\nHowever, when Prime Minister [[G\u00f6ran Persson]] announced his new cabinet appointment on 11 October 2000, Bodstr\u00f6m was a completely unknown face to most of the political journalists attending the press conference.

From October 2006 until October 2010, he was the chairman of the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] committee for judicial issues. When the new parliament, that was elected in 2010, was inaugurated, Bodstr\u00f6m lost his position as a committee chairman. Bodstr\u00f6m shortly afterwards requested half-time leave of absence from his seat in the parliament, combined with half-time parental leave, in order to relocate to the USA together with his family. His request for leave of absence was denied by the Social Democratic group leader in the parliament, and Bodstr\u00f6m has thus left his seat in the Parliament. His part-time parental leave was already granted from the [[Swedish Social Insurance Administration]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/bodstrom-lamnar-politiken-1.1189474 |title=Bodstr\u00f6m i natt: Jag l\u00e4mnar riksdagen |publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|date=15 October 2010 |language=Swedish |trans-title=Bodstr\u00f6m this night: I will leave the Parliament}}</ref> Thomas Bodstr\u00f6m is also active as the chairman of the children's rights organization [[ECPAT]] [[Sweden]].\n\nThomas Bodstr\u00f6m is the son of [[Lennart Bodstr\u00f6m]], who was [[Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs]] from 1982 to 1985 in the [[Olof Palme]] government. In his youth, however, Thomas Bodstr\u00f6m was not involved in party politics. Instead, his first brush with media attention came as a [[association football|football]] player in [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], a team in the [[Allsvenskan|Premier Division of the Swedish Football league]], 1987\u20131989. In 1990, he graduated from [[Stockholm University]] with a Bachelor of Laws degree. After that, he worked as a lawyer for ten years. During his career, he took interest in international affairs, and in 1999, he joined the board of the Swedish branch of the international organisation [[Lawyers Without Borders]].\n\nHowever, when Prime Minister [[G\u00f6ran Persson]] announced his new cabinet appointment on 11 October 2000, Bodstr\u00f6m was a completely unknown face to most of the political journalists attending the press conference. At the time, he was not even a member of the Social Democratic Party.

All three exited the vehicle, but one fell, his legs filled with [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]]. A follow-up strike targeted the group again, killing the two cousins and blowing off a chunk of Barakat's right arm. The cousins died of shrapnel wounds to the chest, according to autopsy reports by a Syrian doctor with the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations, an international medical group.

Former Pentagon intelligence analyst [[Marc Garlasco]] suggested the shrapnel damage at the scene resembled that caused by [[Hydra 70]] rockets, a type used by U.S. military helicopters. Garlasco also suggested the secondary strikes on the men fleeing the van was consistent with a U.S. military practice of targeting \"squirters\"\u2014people perceived to be hostiles running away from an attack. The U.S. military has not confirmed whether it fired on the white van during the raid.<ref name=nprciv/>\n\n== Analysis ==\nA November 6, 2019 [[Brookings Institution]] analysis framed the raid's success as a reminder of the United States' \"power and resolve\" in the [[War on Terror]], remarking on three particular aspects of the operation: [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence collection]], international cooperation, and operational capability. Brookings asserted that it was a combination of U.S. [[hard power]] and [[soft power]] that secured cooperation with Turkey, Russia, Iraq and the Kurds and noted that a synergized combination of [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]], [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]], and [[Imagery intelligence|visual intelligence]] gathering was the key to translating the ISIL informant's information into actionable operational intelligence, such as how the deployment of military dogs indicated U.S. forces were expecting [[Close-quarters combat|close-quarters]] obstacles thanks to intelligence reports. The analysis stated that despite Baghdadi's eight years of experience evading capture or death, the operation succeeded due to the U.S. professionally utilizing the \"Find, Fix, Finish\" intelligence cycle standard: Narrow down Baghdadi's suspected location (the Find), verify his identity and location and translate the intelligence into a feasible action plan (the Fix), and subdue the target (the Finish).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|date=November 6, 2019|title=What we can learn about US intelligence from the Baghdadi raid|work=Brookings Institution|accessdate=27 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127230050/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA November 19, 2019 [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense Inspector General]] report, citing [[Defense Intelligence Agency (United States)|Defense Intelligence Agency]] assessments, stated that Baghdadi's death was \"a significant blow to ISIS but would not likely end the ISIS threat\" and that his demise \"would likely have little effect on the ability of ISIS to reconstitute\" itself as a potent transnational threat, according to open-source analysis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|work=Military Times|date=19 November 2019|title=ISIS expected to revamp operations in Syria, grow ability to target the West, says Pentagon watchdog|accessdate=24 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127234504/https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A report from the DIA in 2020 concluded that Baghdadi's death did not have an immediate impact on ISIL's abilities to operate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/02/04/dia-says-isis-took-advantage-of-turkish-invasion-of-northern-syria-baghdadi-death-did-not-degrade-jihadi-group/ |title=DIA says ISIS took advantage of Turkish invasion of northern Syria, Baghdadi death did not degrade jihadi group |first=Shawn |last=Snow |date=February 4, 2020 |newspaper=[[Military Times]] |quote=Moreover, CENTCOM and the DIA both said in the IG report that the October raid that bagged ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has had no immediate impact on the group\u2019s ability to operate.}}</ref>\n\n== Reactions ==\n[[File:SDF statement on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death.ogg|thumb|Statement by SDF spokesman Redur Khalil on Baghdadi's death]]\nRepresentatives of several countries, including Australia,<ref name=videorelease>{{cite news |title=Trump says U.S. may release parts of Baghdadi raid video |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |via=www.reuters.com |agency=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=October 28, 2019 |access-date=October 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028171220/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |archive-date=October 28, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> France,<ref name=worldreact>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|title=Factbox: World reacts to announcement of Islamic State leader Baghdadi's death|date=October 27, 2019|website=www.reuters.com|access-date=October 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225111908/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|archive-date=December 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Israel,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|title=Netanyahu Congratulates Trump for Baghdadi Killing|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2019|via=www.reuters.com|agency=Reuters|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029021640/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|archive-date=October 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and the United Kingdom,<ref name=\"worldreact\" /> congratulated the United States and said that the death of Baghdadi marked a turning point in the fight against ISIL.

Former Pentagon intelligence analyst [[Marc Garlasco]] suggested the shrapnel damage at the scene resembled that caused by [[Hydra 70]] rockets, a type used by U.S. military helicopters. Garlasco also suggested the secondary strikes on the men fleeing the van was consistent with a U.S. military practice of targeting \"squirters\"\u2014people perceived to be hostiles running away from an attack. The U.S. military has not confirmed whether it fired on the white van during the raid.<ref name=nprciv/>\n\n== Analysis ==\nA November 6, 2019 [[Brookings Institution]] analysis framed the raid's success as a reminder of the United States' \"power and resolve\" in the [[War on Terror]], remarking on three particular aspects of the operation: [[List of intelligence gathering disciplines|intelligence collection]], international cooperation, and operational capability. Brookings asserted that it was a combination of U.S. [[hard power]] and [[soft power]] that secured cooperation with Turkey, Russia, Iraq and the Kurds and noted that a synergized combination of [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|HUMINT]], [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]], and [[Imagery intelligence|visual intelligence]] gathering was the key to translating the ISIL informant's information into actionable operational intelligence, such as how the deployment of military dogs indicated U.S. forces were expecting [[Close-quarters combat|close-quarters]] obstacles thanks to intelligence reports. The analysis stated that despite Baghdadi's eight years of experience evading capture or death, the operation succeeded due to the U.S. professionally utilizing the \"Find, Fix, Finish\" intelligence cycle standard: Narrow down Baghdadi's suspected location (the Find), verify his identity and location and translate the intelligence into a feasible action plan (the Fix), and subdue the target (the Finish).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|date=November 6, 2019|title=What we can learn about US intelligence from the Baghdadi raid|work=Brookings Institution|accessdate=27 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127230050/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/06/what-we-can-learn-about-us-intelligence-from-the-baghdadi-raid/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA November 19, 2019 [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense Inspector General]] report, citing [[Defense Intelligence Agency (United States)|Defense Intelligence Agency]] assessments, stated that Baghdadi's death was \"a significant blow to ISIS but would not likely end the ISIS threat\" and that his demise \"would likely have little effect on the ability of ISIS to reconstitute\" itself as a potent transnational threat, according to open-source analysis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|work=Military Times|date=19 November 2019|title=ISIS expected to revamp operations in Syria, grow ability to target the West, says Pentagon watchdog|accessdate=24 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127234504/https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/11/19/isis-expected-to-revamp-operations-in-syria-grow-ability-to-target-the-west-says-pentagon-watchdog/|archive-date=November 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A report from the DIA in 2020 concluded that Baghdadi's death did not have an immediate impact on ISIL's abilities to operate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2020/02/04/dia-says-isis-took-advantage-of-turkish-invasion-of-northern-syria-baghdadi-death-did-not-degrade-jihadi-group/ |title=DIA says ISIS took advantage of Turkish invasion of northern Syria, Baghdadi death did not degrade jihadi group |first=Shawn |last=Snow |date=February 4, 2020 |newspaper=[[Military Times]] |quote=Moreover, CENTCOM and the DIA both said in the IG report that the October raid that bagged ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has had no immediate impact on the group\u2019s ability to operate.}}</ref>\n\n== Reactions ==\n[[File:SDF statement on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death.ogg|thumb|Statement by SDF spokesman Redur Khalil on Baghdadi's death]]\nRepresentatives of several countries, including Australia,<ref name=videorelease>{{cite news |title=Trump says U.S. may release parts of Baghdadi raid video |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |via=www.reuters.com |agency=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=October 28, 2019 |access-date=October 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028171220/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi/russia-guarded-over-baghdadi-killing-world-leaders-say-fight-goes-on-idUSKBN1X71DY |archive-date=October 28, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> France,<ref name=worldreact>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|title=Factbox: World reacts to announcement of Islamic State leader Baghdadi's death|date=October 27, 2019|website=www.reuters.com|access-date=October 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225111908/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-reaction-fact/factbox-world-reacts-to-announcement-of-islamic-state-leader-baghdadis-death-idUSKBN1X60HS?il=0|archive-date=December 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Israel,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|title=Netanyahu Congratulates Trump for Baghdadi Killing|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2019|via=www.reuters.com|agency=Reuters|access-date=October 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029021640/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-congratulates-trump-for-baghdadi-killing-1.8032102|archive-date=October 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and the United Kingdom,<ref name=\"worldreact\" /> congratulated the United States and said that the death of Baghdadi marked a turning point in the fight against ISIL.

With the 2017 Induction, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame celebrated its 19th anniversary and added six new members to its hall, honoring 157 inductees.\n\nInductees may be nominated in the following categories: Coach, Veteran Coach, Player, International Player, Veteran Player, Contributor,  and Official.\n\n==Highlights==\nThe Women's Basketball Hall of Fame is home to the world's largest basketball sitting on the north rotunda of the hall, measuring 30 feet tall and weighing 10 tons.\n\nThe WBHOF Basketball Courts in the north rotunda of the hall allow one to test one's basketball skills on three different courts representing the hall's mission statement of \"honoring the past, celebrating the present, and promoting the future\" of women's basketball.

The sculptor of the Eastman is Elizabeth MacQueen.  Each year, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame presents its current class of Inductees with a replica of the Eastman statue, known as the \"Eastman\".\n\n===Trailblazers of the Game===\n\n====All American Red Heads====\nThe All American Red Heads played for 50 years, from 1936 to 1986 which is still the longest running women's professional team.  The Red Heads were founded by Mr. and Mrs.C. M. Olson in Cassville, Missouri.  C. M. Olson was the former coach-owner of a male exhibition basketball team called Olson's Terrible Swedes.  Known for their on-court antics, this inspired C. M. Olson's wife, Doyle, and the women who worked in her beauty salons to form a professional basketball exhibition team. In 1954, Coach Orwell Moore and his wife Lorene \"Butch\" Moore bought the Red heads and moved the team to Caraway, Arkansas. Lorene Moore played on the team for eleven years, scoring 35,426 points during her career. The Red Heads were so popular that during the years 1964-1971 there may have been as many as three Red Head teams traveling the country. In 1972, the Red Heads won 500 out of 642 games played against men's team. Throughout the years the All American Red Heads played in all 50 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and the Philippines. The team has been featured in national magazines such as Life, Look, Sports Illustrated and Women's Sports, and they were widely considered as the greatest women's basketball team in the world. Coach Moore retired and disbanded the Red Heads in 1986 after 50 years of play The All American Red Heads still have annual reunions today.\n\n====Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club====\nThe Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club was founded in 1915 by John Percy Page. The origins of the club can be traced to the McDougall Commercial Girls High School Basketball team in Edmonton, Canada. When team members graduated high school, they convinced coach John Percy Page to continue the team as a Club sport. Membership with the Club was exclusive, only 38 women ever wore the Grad jersey. Winnie Martin (Tait) was the First Captain of the Edmonton Grads, playing from 1915-1924. The Grads played 522 games officially in Canada, the United States and Europe. The Club tallied a 502-20 record in 25 years of play The Edmonton Commercial Graduates are widely considered the greatest women's team ever assembled. Financially restrained, members often chipped in to raise funds for national play. Their strong dedication to the game and will to persevere in a time when women's basketball was largely ignored makes the Edmonton Grads praiseworthy John Percy Page coached the club to 18 Canadian Championships The Club attended four sets of Olympic Games: Paris in 1924, Amsterdam in 1928, Los Angeles in 1932, and Berlin in 1936 where they received 4 unofficial Olympic titles The Club played its last game on June 5, 1940, defeating a Chicago team 62-52 Dr. James A. Naismith was quoted to say, \"There is no team that I mention more frequently in talking about the game. My admiration is not only for your remarkable record of games won (which itself would make you stand out in the history of basketball) but also for your record of clean play, versatility in meeting teams at their own style, and more especially for your unbroken record of good sportsmanship.\"\n\n====Wayland Baptist Flying Queens====\nClaude Hutcherson, a Wayland graduate and owner of Hutcherson Air Service, provided air transportation for the Queens to games in Mexico in 1948. That encounter blossomed into a full sponsorship of the team in 1950, a change that brought with it a new mascot - the Hutcherson Flying Queens. Five decades later, Wayland is still atop the world of women's basketball for they still remain the only women's team in history to win 1,300 games. Long before Connecticut became a dominant power in women's basketball, the Flying Queens of Wayland Baptist thrived on innovation, talent and glamour, playing on athletic scholarships, traveling by private planes, warming up with ostentatious drills learned from the Harlem Globetrotters and winning every game for nearly five seasons. The Wayland Baptist University women's team achieved a 131-game winning streak from November 1953 to March 1958 before losing 46-42 to Nashville Business School. During that time the Flying Queens captured four consecutive AAU national championships.\n\n====Mighty Macs====\nThe 1972-74 Mighty Macs team captured the first three Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) championships. Immaculata is considered the birthplace of modern college women's basketball. In addition, to winning the first three college national championships, the Mighty Macs were the first women's team along with the University of Maryland to appear on National television. They were also the first women's team, along with Queen's College, to play at Madison Square Garden. Their inspirational story was made into a feature-length theatrical movie called The Mighty Macs and released by Sony Pictures in 2011. The 1972-74 teams have produced 3 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams; Janet Ruch Boltz, Denise Conway Crawford, Janet Young Eline, [[Theresa Shank Grentz]] (Class of 2001), Barbara Deuble Kelly, Tina Krah, Patricia Mulhern Loughran, Judy Marra Martelli, Sue Forsyth O'Grady, Rene Muth Portland, Betty Ann Hoffman Quinn, [[Cathy Rush]] (Class of 2000), Mary Scharff, [[Marianne Crawford Stanley]] (Class of 2002), Maureen Stuhlman, and Marie Liguori Williams.\n\n====Delta State teams====\nThe 1975, 1976, and 1977 Delta State teams captured three consecutive AIAW championships. After finishing 16\u20132 in the 1973-74 revival season following a 40-year layoff of the women's basketball program, Delta State proceeded to end Immaculata College's three-year AIAW national championship reign in season No. 2 by going undefeated at 28-0. Delta State followed its first AIAW national crown by also winning the next two as the Lady Statesmen defeated Immaculata (69-64) at Penn State and then LSU (68-55) at Minnesota. During their three championship years, Delta State compiled a 93-4 record (28-0, 33-1, 32-3), including a then-record 51 straight wins.

Knoxville is known for having a large women's basketball following as well as being the home of the [[University of Tennessee]]'s [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Lady Vols]] basketball team previously coached by women's coach [[Pat Summitt]], who was part of the first class inducted.  With the 2017 Induction, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame celebrated its 19th anniversary and added six new members to its hall, honoring 157 inductees.\n\nInductees may be nominated in the following categories: Coach, Veteran Coach, Player, International Player, Veteran Player, Contributor,  and Official.\n\n==Highlights==\nThe Women's Basketball Hall of Fame is home to the world's largest basketball sitting on the north rotunda of the hall, measuring 30 feet tall and weighing 10 tons.\n\nThe WBHOF Basketball Courts in the north rotunda of the hall allow one to test one's basketball skills on three different courts representing the hall's mission statement of \"honoring the past, celebrating the present, and promoting the future\" of women's basketball.  The courts also are home to a timed dribbling course and a passing skills area.  There is also a photo area where you can pretend to be players from different eras in history.\n\n===Pat Summitt Rotunda===\nPat Summitt Rotunda is located at the entrance of the WBHOF.  This area remembers founding board member and Class of 1999 inductee Pat Summitt.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Summitt anniversary at Women's Basketball Hall of Fame |url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/no-summitt-anniversary-at-womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/51-452841991 |website=wbir.com |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard outside of the Pat Summitt Rotunda is shaped like a basketball and is made of numerous bricks with personalized inscriptions. Many of the bricks are engraved to honor guests, inductees and a host of other who have chosen to leave their legacy at the hall of fame.\n\n===Hall of Honor===\nThe Hall of Honor is the location within the Hall of Fame that recognizes the achievements of each of the inductees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitknoxville.com/listings/womens-basketball-hall-of-fame/127/|title=Women's Basketball Hall of Fame|website=www.visitknoxville.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref>\n\n===Eastman Statue===\nAs you enter the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame the first thing you see is the Eastman Statue.  This 17-foot-tall bronze statue exemplifies our{{Who|date=December 2017}} mission to \"honor the past, celebrate the present and promote the future: of women's basketball.  The sculptor of the Eastman is Elizabeth MacQueen.  Each year, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame presents its current class of Inductees with a replica of the Eastman statue, known as the \"Eastman\".\n\n===Trailblazers of the Game===\nThe All American Red Heads played for 50 years, from 1936 to 1986 which is still the longest running women's professional team.  The Red Heads were founded by Mr. and Mrs.C. M. Olson in Cassville, Missouri.  C. M. Olson was the former coach-owner of a male exhibition basketball team called Olson's Terrible Swedes.  Known for their on-court antics, this inspired C. M. Olson's wife, Doyle, and the women who worked in her beauty salons to form a professional basketball exhibition team. In 1954, Coach Orwell Moore and his wife Lorene \"Butch\" Moore bought the Red heads and moved the team to Caraway, Arkansas. Lorene Moore played on the team for eleven years, scoring 35,426 points during her career. The Red Heads were so popular that during the years 1964-1971 there may have been as many as three Red Head teams traveling the country. In 1972, the Red Heads won 500 out of 642 games played against men's team. Throughout the years the All American Red Heads played in all 50 states as well as Mexico, Canada, and the Philippines. The team has been featured in national magazines such as Life, Look, Sports Illustrated and Women's Sports, and they were widely considered as the greatest women's basketball team in the world. Coach Moore retired and disbanded the Red Heads in 1986 after 50 years of play The All American Red Heads still have annual reunions today.\n\nThe Edmonton Commercial Graduates Basketball Club was founded in 1915 by John Percy Page. The origins of the club can be traced to the McDougall Commercial Girls High School Basketball team in Edmonton, Canada. When team members graduated high school, they convinced coach John Percy Page to continue the team as a Club sport. Membership with the Club was exclusive, only 38 women ever wore the Grad jersey. Winnie Martin (Tait) was the First Captain of the Edmonton Grads, playing from 1915-1924. The Grads played 522 games officially in Canada, the United States and Europe. The Club tallied a 502-20 record in 25 years of play The Edmonton Commercial Graduates are widely considered the greatest women's team ever assembled. Financially restrained, members often chipped in to raise funds for national play. Their strong dedication to the game and will to persevere in a time when women's basketball was largely ignored makes the Edmonton Grads praiseworthy John Percy Page coached the club to 18 Canadian Championships The Club attended four sets of Olympic Games: Paris in 1924, Amsterdam in 1928, Los Angeles in 1932, and Berlin in 1936 where they received 4 unofficial Olympic titles The Club played its last game on June 5, 1940, defeating a Chicago team 62-52 Dr. James A. Naismith was quoted to say, \"There is no team that I mention more frequently in talking about the game. My admiration is not only for your remarkable record of games won (which itself would make you stand out in the history of basketball) but also for your record of clean play, versatility in meeting teams at their own style, and more especially for your unbroken record of good sportsmanship.\"\n\n====Wayland Baptist Flying Queens====\nClaude Hutcherson, a Wayland graduate and owner of Hutcherson Air Service, provided air transportation for the Queens to games in Mexico in 1948. That encounter blossomed into a full sponsorship of the team in 1950, a change that brought with it a new mascot - the Hutcherson Flying Queens. Five decades later, Wayland is still atop the world of women's basketball for they still remain the only women's team in history to win 1,300 games. Long before Connecticut became a dominant power in women's basketball, the Flying Queens of Wayland Baptist thrived on innovation, talent and glamour, playing on athletic scholarships, traveling by private planes, warming up with ostentatious drills learned from the Harlem Globetrotters and winning every game for nearly five seasons. The Wayland Baptist University women's team achieved a 131-game winning streak from November 1953 to March 1958 before losing 46-42 to Nashville Business School. During that time the Flying Queens captured four consecutive AAU national championships.\n\nThe 1972-74 Mighty Macs team captured the first three Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) championships. Immaculata is considered the birthplace of modern college women's basketball. In addition, to winning the first three college national championships, the Mighty Macs were the first women's team along with the University of Maryland to appear on National television. They were also the first women's team, along with Queen's College, to play at Madison Square Garden. Their inspirational story was made into a feature-length theatrical movie called The Mighty Macs and released by Sony Pictures in 2011. The 1972-74 teams have produced 3 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame Inductees. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams; Janet Ruch Boltz, Denise Conway Crawford, Janet Young Eline, Theresa Shank Grentz (Class of 2001), Barbara Deuble Kelly, Tina Krah, Patricia Mulhern Loughran, Judy Marra Martelli, Sue Forsyth O'Grady, Rene Muth Portland, Betty Ann Hoffman Quinn, Cathy Rush (Class of 2000), Mary Scharff, Marianne Crawford Stanley (Class of 2002), Maureen Stuhlman, and Marie Liguori Williams.\n\nThe 1975, 1976, and 1977 Delta State teams captured three consecutive AIAW championships. After finishing 16\u20132 in the 1973-74 revival season following a 40-year layoff of the women's basketball program, Delta State proceeded to end Immaculata College's three-year AIAW national championship reign in season No. 2 by going undefeated at 28-0. Delta State followed its first AIAW national crown by also winning the next two as the Lady Statesmen defeated Immaculata (69-64) at Penn State and then LSU (68-55) at Minnesota. During their three championship years, Delta State compiled a 93-4 record (28-0, 33-1, 32-3), including a then-record 51 straight wins. The 1975-77 teams have produced 2 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame inductees, Margaret Wade and Lusia Harris Stewart. The WBCA Wade Trophy, considered the Heisman of women's basketball, is named in honor of Lily Margaret Wade. Listed are the individuals associated with the three teams: Angel Fortenberry, Ann Logue, Beth Trussell, Cornelia Ward, Debbie Brock, Jackie Caston, Janie Evans, Jill Rhodes, Judy Davis, Kathy Lewis, Key Crump, Laurie Ann Harper, Lusia Harris Stewart (Class of 1999), Lynn Adubato, Mandy Fortenberyy, Margaret Wade (Class of 1999), Mary Logue, Melissa Thames, Melissa Ward, Mimi Williams, Pam Piazza, Romona Von Boeckman, Sheri Haynes, Tish Fahey, Virginia Shackelford, and Wanda Hairston.\n\nThe 1976 USA Women's Basketball team captured the United States' first medal in Olympic women's basketball history winning the silver medal. The USA's silver medal finish served a notice to the rest of the world that the United States would be a force in Olympic women's basketball. Since the 1976 Olympics, the USA Women's Basketball Teams have compiled a record of 55 and 1 and captured 7 gold medals and 1 bronze in Olympic play.

The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' {NOT CANNON}|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]'' {NOT CANNON}|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began serialization in May 2011. The manga is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest ongoing series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes  as of December 2019.\n\n[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|A 13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half the part were released between in 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom_Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|a new anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation.
