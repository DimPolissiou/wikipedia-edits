It was commissioned by the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in 1931 and conceived by [[Stanley Morison]], the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]], in collaboration with [[Victor Lardent]], a lettering artist in ''The Times's'' advertising department. It has become one of the most popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most [[desktop computer]]s.\n\nAsked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that ''The Times'' change their text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before. This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]] as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in ''The Times'' on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or [[Roman type|roman]] style (sometimes also called [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|Antiqua]]), the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman's design has no connection to [[Rome]] or to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\n''The Times'' stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from [[broadsheet]] to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] in 2004 have caused it to switch typeface five times from 1972 to 2007. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman typeface.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Times New Roman and predecessor.jpg|thumb|right|Twenty-two lines in Times New Roman compared to its predecessor \"modern\" serif font.{{efn|\"Modern\" in typography is a generic term referring to designs in the [[Didone (typography)|modern or Didone]] style of the nineteenth century.}} Times appears larger on the page, with tighter linespacing and more solid in appearance.<ref name=\"Printing the Times 1932\">{{cite book |title=Printing the Times: A record of the changes introduced in the issue for October 3, 1932 |date=1932 |location=London}}</ref>]]\nTimes New Roman has a robust [[Type color|colour]] on the page and influences of European [[Early modern period|early modern]] and [[Baroque period|Baroque]] printing.<ref name=\"Monotype Recorder: The Changing Newspaper\">{{cite journal|first=Stanley|last=Morison|title=Monotype Recorder: The Changing Newspaper|journal=Monotype Recorder|volume=35|issue=1|date=1936|url=http://www.metaltype.co.uk/downloads/mr/mr_35_1.pdf}}</ref>{{efn|\"The Changing Newspaper\" articles in the ''Monotype Recorder'' are unsigned, but Monotype's newspaper consultant Allen Hutt, who co-authored the issue, attributes them to Morison.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=263}}}} As a typeface designed for newspaper printing, Times New Roman has a high [[x-height]], short [[descender]]s to allow tight linespacing and a relatively condensed appearance.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=117}}{{efn|While Times is often described as being quite \"condensed\" this is relative to its high x-height: typefaces with lower x-height, such as many versions of [[Garamond]], [[Caslon]] and [[Bembo]], are narrower at equalised cap height.

(Perpetua, which Monotype had recently commissioned from sculptor [[Eric Gill]] at Morison's urging, is considered a 'transitional' design in aesthetic, although it does not revive any specific model.)

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point [[Body (typography)|bodies]]. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing.

Linotype referred to the design as ''Times'' or ''Times Roman''. Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but slight differences have split the lineage of Times into two subtly different designs.\n\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to [[cold type|photo]] and digital media. For example, Linotype has slanted [[serif]]s on the capital S, while Monotype's are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5.<ref name=\"Strizver TypeTalk\">{{cite web|first=Ilene|last=Strizver|url=http://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-times-roman-vs-times-new-roman|title=TypeTalk: Times Roman vs Times New Roman|work=CreativePro.com}}</ref> Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details as well as the width metrics for their version of Times grew apart.<ref name=\"times-development\" /> Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight, (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight){{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} and in the percent sign in all weights. (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not.) Monotype's 'J' is non-descending, but Linotype's in the bold weight descends below the baseline.\n\nLinotype licensed its version to [[Xerox]] and then [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the [[PostScript]] page description language.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/|website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Microsoft's version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name.

In the 1980s, there was an attempt by a group of entrepreneurs to seek from [[Rupert Murdoch]], who owned ''The Times'', the right to use the Times Roman name; separately, a legal action was also initiated to clarify the right of Monotype to use the name in the US despite Linotype's registration. As a result of legal action, Linotype and its licensees continued to use the name Times Roman, while Monotype and its licensees used the name Times New Roman.<ref name=\"times-development\">{{cite web |url= http://www.truetype-typography.com/articles/times.htm |title=Times (New) Roman and its part in the Development of Scalable Font Technology |author=Charles Bigelow |year=1994 |accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Modern releases==\n\n===As Times New Roman===\nMonotype sells a wider range of styles and [[Font#Optical size|optical sizes]] for Times New Roman than are offered with Windows, in order to meet the needs of newspapers and books which print at a range of text sizes.<ref name=\"Changing the Times\" /> Its current release includes Regular, Medium, Semi Bold and Bold weights with matching italics, Extra Bold, Condensed (in regular, italic and bold), Seven (for smaller text, in regular, italic, bold and bold italic) and Small Text (for very small text, in regular, italic and bold).<ref>{{cite web|title=Monotype Library: Times New Roman|url=http://www.linotype.com/1540/TimesNewRoman-family.html|publisher=Monotype|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref> The four-weight version included with Windows was also distributed as part of Microsoft's [[Core Fonts for the Web]] package.<ref name=\"apple-techspot\">{{cite web | url=http://www.techspot.com/news/26438-microsoft-and-apple-extend-font-licensing-agreement.html |title=Microsoft and Apple extend font licensing agreement |author=Jose Vilches |date=2007-08-03 |accessdate=2011-06-25}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2017, the version of Times New Roman included with [[Windows 10]], version 6.96, includes [[small capitals]], [[text figures]], and italic [[swash capitals]].<ref name=\"TNR 6.96\">{{cite AV media | people = | date =\n | title = Times New Roman, v. 6.96 | medium = Font digitisation }}</ref><ref name=\"FIU New Roman Times Swash capital comment\">{{cite web |last1=Thiago |last2=Hardwig |first2=Florian |title=New Roman Times \u2013 Camper Van Beethoven |url=https://fontsinuse.com/uses/25135/new-roman-times-camper-van-beethoven#comment-631475 |website=Fonts in Use |accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref> The Microsoft/Monotype digitisation of Times New Roman omits automatic [[typographic ligature|ligature]] insertion (although as of v. 6.96 it is selectable),<ref name=\"TNR 6.96\" /> which the version of Times installed with macOS has.

It was commissioned by the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in 1931 and conceived by [[Stanley Morison]], the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]], in collaboration with [[Victor Lardent]], a lettering artist in ''The Times's'' advertising department. It has become one of the most popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most [[desktop computer]]s.\n\nAsked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that ''The Times'' change their text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before. This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]] as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in ''The Times'' on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or [[Roman type|roman]] style (sometimes also called [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|Antiqua]]), the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman's design has no connection to [[Rome]] or to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\n''The Times'' stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from [[broadsheet]] to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] in 2004 have caused it to switch typeface five times from 1972 to 2007. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman typeface.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Times New Roman and predecessor.jpg|thumb|right|Twenty-two lines in Times New Roman compared to its predecessor \"modern\" serif font.{{efn|\"Modern\" in typography is a generic term referring to designs in the [[Didone (typography)|modern or Didone]] style of the nineteenth century.}} Times appears larger on the page, with tighter linespacing and more solid in appearance.<ref name=\"Printing the Times 1932\">{{cite book |title=Printing the Times: A record of the changes introduced in the issue for October 3, 1932 |date=1932 |location=London}}</ref>]]\nTimes New Roman has a robust [[Type color|colour]] on the page and influences of European [[Early modern period|early modern]] and [[Baroque period|Baroque]] printing.<ref name=\"Monotype Recorder: The Changing Newspaper\">{{cite journal|first=Stanley|last=Morison|title=Monotype Recorder: The Changing Newspaper|journal=Monotype Recorder|volume=35|issue=1|date=1936|url=http://www.metaltype.co.uk/downloads/mr/mr_35_1.pdf}}</ref>{{efn|\"The Changing Newspaper\" articles in the ''Monotype Recorder'' are unsigned, but Monotype's newspaper consultant Allen Hutt, who co-authored the issue, attributes them to Morison.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=263}}}} As a typeface designed for newspaper printing, Times New Roman has a high [[x-height]], short [[descender]]s to allow tight linespacing and a relatively condensed appearance.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=117}}{{efn|While Times is often described as being quite \"condensed\" this is relative to its high x-height: typefaces with lower x-height, such as many versions of [[Garamond]], [[Caslon]] and [[Bembo]], are narrower at equalised cap height.

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point [[Body (typography)|bodies]]. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T.

Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing.

Users found that in the hot metal period it was common for the molten metal to rapidly eat through the matrices as type was being cast, and so it did not become popular among other newspapers: \"Times Roman achieved its popularity chiefly in general printing, not in newspaper work.\"{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} He described it as particularly used in \"book work, especially non-fiction\" such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} Allen Hutt also commented that Times New Roman's relative condensation was less useful than might be expected for newspaper printing, since in a normal newspaper column frequent paragraph breaks tend to provide area that can absorb the space of wider letters without increasing the number of lines used\u2013but ''The Times'', whose [[Style guide|house style]] in the 1930s was to minimise the number of paragraph breaks, was an exception to this.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=264}}\n\nTimes New Roman remains popular in publishing, helped by the extremely large range of characters available for international and mathematics printing.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=102}}<ref name=\"Es gilt das gesprochene Wort\">{{cite web |last1=Bergmann |first1=Christopher |title=Es gilt das gesprochene Wort: Schriftarten f\u00fcr IPA-Transkriptionen |url=https://www.isoglosse.de/2014/03/schriftarten-ipa-transkriptionen/ |website=Isoglosse |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> For example, the [[American Psychological Association]] suggests using Times New Roman in papers written in its [[APA style]].<ref name=\"APA Style Blog\">{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Chelsea |title=Fonts of Knowledge |url=https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2013/03/fonts-of-knowledge.html |website=APA Style Blog |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n==Linotype releases==\n[[File:Many accented a (8277806822).jpg|thumb|Working drawings for a Linotype release of \"Times Roman\".

Linotype referred to the design as ''Times'' or ''Times Roman''. Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but slight differences have split the lineage of Times into two subtly different designs.\n\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to [[cold type|photo]] and digital media. For example, Linotype has slanted [[serif]]s on the capital S, while Monotype's are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5.<ref name=\"Strizver TypeTalk\">{{cite web|first=Ilene|last=Strizver|url=http://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-times-roman-vs-times-new-roman|title=TypeTalk: Times Roman vs Times New Roman|work=CreativePro.com}}</ref> Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details as well as the width metrics for their version of Times grew apart.<ref name=\"times-development\" /> Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight, (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight){{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} and in the percent sign in all weights. (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not.) Monotype's 'J' is non-descending, but Linotype's in the bold weight descends below the baseline.\n\nLinotype licensed its version to [[Xerox]] and then [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the [[PostScript]] page description language.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/|website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Microsoft's version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name.

In the 1980s, there was an attempt by a group of entrepreneurs to seek from [[Rupert Murdoch]], who owned ''The Times'', the right to use the Times Roman name; separately, a legal action was also initiated to clarify the right of Monotype to use the name in the US despite Linotype's registration.
