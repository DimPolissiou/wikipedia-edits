The Austrian [[Neurology|neurologist]], [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856\u20131939), attended. In his book ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' first published in 1899, he proposed that an Oedipal desire is a universal, psychological phenomenon innate ([[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]]) to human beings, and the cause of much unconscious guilt.

After his father's death in 1896, and having seen the play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', by [[Sophocles]], Freud begins using the term \"Oedipus\". As Freud wrote in an 1897 letter, \"I found in myself a constant love for my mother, and jealousy of my father. I now consider this to be a universal event in early childhood. \n*Stage 2. 1909\u20131914. Proposes that Oedipal [[libido|desire]] is the \"nuclear complex\" of all neuroses; first usage of \"Oedipus complex\" in 1910.\n*Stage 3. 1914\u20131918. Considers paternal and maternal [[incest]].\n*Stage 4. 1919\u20131926. Complete Oedipus complex; [[identification (psychology)|identification]] and [[bisexuality]] are conceptually evident in later works.\n*Stage 5. 1926\u20131931. Applies the Oedipal theory to religion and [[Social norm|custom]].\n*Stage 6. 1931\u20131938. Investigates the \"feminine Oedipus attitude\" and \"negative Oedipus complex\"; later the \"Electra complex\".<ref>Bennett Simon, Rachel B.

''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism''  (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995)</ref><ref>Charles Rycroft ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London, 2nd ed., 1995)</ref>\n\nIn the [[phallic stage]], a boy's decisive psychosexual experience is the Oedipus complex\u2014his son\u2013father competition for possession of mother. It is in this third stage of [[psychosexual development]] that the child's genitalia is his or her primary [[erogenous zone]]; thus, when children become aware of their bodies, the bodies of other children, and the bodies of their parents, they gratify physical curiosity by undressing and exploring themselves, each other, and their genitals, so learning the [[Human body|anatomic]] differences between male and female and the [[gender]] differences between boy and girl.\n\n''Psychosexual infantilism''\u2014Despite mother being the parent who primarily gratifies the child's [[Libido|desires]], the child begins forming a discrete sexual identity\u2014\"boy\", \"girl\"\u2014that alters the dynamics of the parent and child relationship; the parents become objects of infantile [[Libido|libidinal]] energy. The boy directs his libido (sexual desire) upon his mother and directs jealousy and emotional rivalry against his father\u2014because it is he who sleeps with his mother. Moreover, to facilitate union with mother, the boy's [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]] wants to kill father (as did [[Oedipus]]), but the pragmatic [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]], based upon the [[reality principle]], knows that the father is the stronger of the two males competing to possess the one female. Nonetheless, the boy remains ambivalent about his father's place in the family, which is manifested as [[castration anxiety|fear of castration]] by the physically greater father; the fear is an irrational, subconscious manifestation of the infantile id.<ref>Allan Bullock, Stephen Trombley ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (London:Harper Collins 1999)  pp. 607, 705</ref>\n\n''Psycho-logic defense''\u2014In both sexes, [[defense mechanism]]s provide transitory resolutions of the conflict between the drives of the id and the drives of the ego. The first defense mechanism is [[Psychological repression|repression]], the blocking of memories, emotional impulses, and ideas from the conscious mind; yet its action does not resolve the id\u2013ego conflict. The second defense mechanism is [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], in which the boy or girl child adapts by incorporating, to his or her (super)ego, the personality characteristics of the same-sex parent. As a result of this, the boy diminishes his [[castration anxiety]], because his likeness to father protects him from father's wrath in their maternal rivalry. In the case of the girl, this facilitates identifying with mother, who understands that, in being females, neither of them possesses a penis, and thus are not antagonists.<ref>Allan Bullock, Stephen Trombley ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (London:Harper Collins 1999) pp. 205, 107</ref>\n\n''D\u00e9nouement''\u2014Unresolved son\u2013father competition for the psycho-sexual possession of the mother might result in a [[phallic stage]] [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] that leads to the boy becoming an aggressive, over-ambitious, and vain man. Therefore, the satisfactory parental handling and resolution of the Oedipus complex are most important in developing the male infantile [[Id, ego and super-ego|super-ego]]. This is because, by identifying with a parent, the boy [[Internalization|internalizes]] [[Morality]]; thereby, he chooses to comply with societal rules, rather than reflexively complying in fear of punishment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Oedipal case study===<!-- This section is linked from [[Sigmund Freud]] -->\n[[Image:1869 Frederic Leighton - Electra at the Tomb of Agamemnon.jpg|thumb|upright|Female Oedipus attitude: ''Electra at the Tomb of [[Agamemnon]]'', by [[Frederic Leighton]], (c.1869)]]\nIn ''Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-year-old Boy'' (1909), the case study of the [[Equinophobia|equinophobic]] boy \"[[Herbert Graf|Little Hans]]\", Freud showed that the relation between Hans's fears\u2014of horses and of his father\u2014derived from external factors, the birth of a sister, and internal factors, the desire of the infantile id to replace father as companion to mother, and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for enjoying the [[masturbation]] normal to a boy of his age.

Educators and mentors are put in the ego ideal of the individual and they strive to take on their knowledge, skills, or insights.\n\nIn ''Some Reflections on Schoolboy Psychology'' (1914), Freud writes:\n:\"We can now understand our relation to our schoolmasters. These men, not all of whom were in fact fathers themselves, became our substitute fathers. That was why, even though they were still quite young, they struck us as so mature and so unattainably adult. We transferred on to them the respect and expectations attaching to the omniscient father of our childhood, and we then began to treat them as we treated our fathers at home. We confronted them with the ambivalence that we had acquired in our own families and with its help, we struggled with them as we had been in the habit of struggling with our fathers...\"\n\nThe Oedipus complex, in narcissistic terms, represents that an individual can lose the ability to take a parental-substitute into his [[ego ideal]] without ambivalence. Once the individual has ambivalent relations with parental-substitutes, he will enter into the triangulating castration complex. In the castration complex the individual becomes rivalrous with parental-substitutes and this will be the point of regression. In ''Psycho-analytic notes on an autobiographical account of a case of paranoia (Dementia paranoides)'' (1911), Freud writes that \"disappointment over a woman\" (object drives) or \"a mishap in social relations with other men\" (ego drives) is the cause of regression or symptom formation. Triangulation can take place with a romantic rival, for a woman, or with a work rival, for the reputation of being more potent.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pederson|first1=Trevor|title=The Economics of Libido: Psychic Bisexuality, the Superego, and the Centrality of the Oedipus Complex|date=2015|publisher=Karnac}}</ref>\n\n==Freudian theoretic revision==\nWhen [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856\u20131939) proposed that the Oedipus complex was psychologically universal, he provoked the evolution of [[Ego psychology|Freudian psychology]] and the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] treatment method, by collaborators and competitors alike.\n\n===Carl Gustav Jung===\n[[Image:Electra and Orestes - Project Gutenberg eText 14994.png|thumb|left|The Electra complex: the [[matricide]]s Electra and Orestes.]]\n\nIn countering Freud's proposal that the [[psychosexual development]] of boys and girls is equal, i.e. equally oriented \u2013 that each initially experiences sexual desire ([[libido]]) for mother, and aggression towards father, student\u2013collaborator [[Carl Jung]] counter-proposed that girls experienced desire for father and aggression towards mother via the [[Electra complex]]{{citation needed|reason=Where did Jung write about this?

In contrast, in the early 1920s, using the term \"pre-Oedipal\", [[Otto Rank]] proposed that a boy's powerful mother was the source of the super-ego, in the course of normal [[psychosexual development]].

In the 1950s psychologists distinguished different roles in parenting for the mother and father. The role of primary caregiver is assigned to the mother. Motherly love was considered to be unconditional. While the father is assigned the role of secondary caregiver, fatherly love is conditional, responsive to the child's tangible achievements.<ref name=\":0\" /> Recent studies suggest, however, that the notions of male and female gender parenting roles and attributes are a result of culture and continuous practice in psychoanalysis with no biological basis.

In the case of newer family structures that refute the traditional Oedipus complex, it may mean modifying or discarding the complex completely. Shenkman suggests that a loose interpretation of the Oedipus complex in which the child seeks sexual satisfaction from any parent regardless of [[gender or sex]], would be helpful: \"From this perspective, any parental authority, or institution for that matter, may represent the taboo that gives rise to the complex\".

The study attempted to distinguish conceptually phenotypic matching from positive sexual imprinting. Phenotypic matching can be understood as an individual's seeking (presumably without conscious awareness) traits in mates that are similar to their own phenotype. Sexual imprinting can be understood as mate preferences that are influenced by experiences and observations with parents/caregivers in early childhood. Adoptive daughters were examined in part to disentangle these two influences. The results of the study support positive sexual imprinting independent of phenotypic matching: \"Judges found significant resemblance on facial traits between daughter's husband and her adoptive father. Furthermore, this effect may be modified by the quality of the father\u2013daughter relationship during childhood. Daughters who received more emotional support from their adoptive father were more likely to choose mates similar to the father than those whose father provided a less positive emotional atmosphere.\" The study's authors also hypothesized that \"sexual imprinting on the observed features of the opposite-sex parent during a sensitive period in early childhood might be responsible for shaping people's later mate-choice criteria,\" a hypothesis that would be at least partially in accordance with Freud's Oedipal model.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1098/rspb.2003.2672|pmid = 15306362|pmc = 1691703|title = Sexual imprinting in human mate choice|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

After his father's death in 1896, and having seen the play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', by [[Sophocles]], Freud begins using the term \"Oedipus\". As Freud wrote in an 1897 letter, \"I found in myself a constant love for my mother, and jealousy of my father.

It is in this third stage of [[psychosexual development]] that the child's genitalia is his or her primary [[erogenous zone]]; thus, when children become aware of their bodies, the bodies of other children, and the bodies of their parents, they gratify physical curiosity by undressing and exploring themselves, each other, and their genitals, so learning the [[Human body|anatomic]] differences between male and female and the [[gender]] differences between boy and girl.\n\n''Psychosexual infantilism''\u2014Despite mother being the parent who primarily gratifies the child's [[Libido|desires]], the child begins forming a discrete sexual identity\u2014\"boy\", \"girl\"\u2014that alters the dynamics of the parent and child relationship; the parents become objects of infantile [[Libido|libidinal]] energy. The boy directs his libido (sexual desire) upon his mother and directs jealousy and emotional rivalry against his father\u2014because it is he who sleeps with his mother. Moreover, to facilitate union with mother, the boy's [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]] wants to kill father (as did [[Oedipus]]), but the pragmatic [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]], based upon the [[reality principle]], knows that the father is the stronger of the two males competing to possess the one female. Nonetheless, the boy remains ambivalent about his father's place in the family, which is manifested as [[castration anxiety|fear of castration]] by the physically greater father; the fear is an irrational, subconscious manifestation of the infantile id.<ref>Allan Bullock, Stephen Trombley ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (London:Harper Collins 1999)  pp. 607, 705</ref>\n\n''Psycho-logic defense''\u2014In both sexes, [[defense mechanism]]s provide transitory resolutions of the conflict between the drives of the id and the drives of the ego. The first defense mechanism is [[Psychological repression|repression]], the blocking of memories, emotional impulses, and ideas from the conscious mind; yet its action does not resolve the id\u2013ego conflict. The second defense mechanism is [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], in which the boy or girl child adapts by incorporating, to his or her (super)ego, the personality characteristics of the same-sex parent. As a result of this, the boy diminishes his [[castration anxiety]], because his likeness to father protects him from father's wrath in their maternal rivalry. In the case of the girl, this facilitates identifying with mother, who understands that, in being females, neither of them possesses a penis, and thus are not antagonists.<ref>Allan Bullock, Stephen Trombley ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (London:Harper Collins 1999) pp. 205, 107</ref>\n\n''D\u00e9nouement''\u2014Unresolved son\u2013father competition for the psycho-sexual possession of the mother might result in a [[phallic stage]] [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] that leads to the boy becoming an aggressive, over-ambitious, and vain man. Therefore, the satisfactory parental handling and resolution of the Oedipus complex are most important in developing the male infantile [[Id, ego and super-ego|super-ego]]. This is because, by identifying with a parent, the boy [[Internalization|internalizes]] [[Morality]]; thereby, he chooses to comply with societal rules, rather than reflexively complying in fear of punishment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Oedipal case study===<!-- This section is linked from [[Sigmund Freud]] -->\n[[Image:1869 Frederic Leighton - Electra at the Tomb of Agamemnon.jpg|thumb|upright|Female Oedipus attitude: ''Electra at the Tomb of [[Agamemnon]]'', by [[Frederic Leighton]], (c.1869)]]\nIn ''Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-year-old Boy'' (1909), the case study of the [[Equinophobia|equinophobic]] boy \"[[Herbert Graf|Little Hans]]\", Freud showed that the relation between Hans's fears\u2014of horses and of his father\u2014derived from external factors, the birth of a sister, and internal factors, the desire of the infantile id to replace father as companion to mother, and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for enjoying the [[masturbation]] normal to a boy of his age.

[the parent's] personal significance for the superego recedes into the background' and 'the imagos they leave behind... link [to] the influences of teachers and authorities...\". Educators and mentors are put in the ego ideal of the individual and they strive to take on their knowledge, skills, or insights.\n\nIn ''Some Reflections on Schoolboy Psychology'' (1914), Freud writes:\n:\"We can now understand our relation to our schoolmasters. These men, not all of whom were in fact fathers themselves, became our substitute fathers. That was why, even though they were still quite young, they struck us as so mature and so unattainably adult. We transferred on to them the respect and expectations attaching to the omniscient father of our childhood, and we then began to treat them as we treated our fathers at home. We confronted them with the ambivalence that we had acquired in our own families and with its help, we struggled with them as we had been in the habit of struggling with our fathers...\"\n\nThe Oedipus complex, in narcissistic terms, represents that an individual can lose the ability to take a parental-substitute into his [[ego ideal]] without ambivalence. Once the individual has ambivalent relations with parental-substitutes, he will enter into the triangulating castration complex. In the castration complex the individual becomes rivalrous with parental-substitutes and this will be the point of regression. In ''Psycho-analytic notes on an autobiographical account of a case of paranoia (Dementia paranoides)'' (1911), Freud writes that \"disappointment over a woman\" (object drives) or \"a mishap in social relations with other men\" (ego drives) is the cause of regression or symptom formation. Triangulation can take place with a romantic rival, for a woman, or with a work rival, for the reputation of being more potent.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pederson|first1=Trevor|title=The Economics of Libido: Psychic Bisexuality, the Superego, and the Centrality of the Oedipus Complex|date=2015|publisher=Karnac}}</ref>\n\n==Freudian theoretic revision==\nWhen [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856\u20131939) proposed that the Oedipus complex was psychologically universal, he provoked the evolution of [[Ego psychology|Freudian psychology]] and the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] treatment method, by collaborators and competitors alike.\n\n===Carl Gustav Jung===\n[[Image:Electra and Orestes - Project Gutenberg eText 14994.png|thumb|left|The Electra complex: the [[matricide]]s Electra and Orestes.]]\n\nIn countering Freud's proposal that the [[psychosexual development]] of boys and girls is equal, i.e. equally oriented \u2013 that each initially experiences sexual desire ([[libido]]) for mother, and aggression towards father, student\u2013collaborator [[Carl Jung]] counter-proposed that girls experienced desire for father and aggression towards mother via the [[Electra complex]]{{citation needed|reason=Where did Jung write about this?

As a result the pillars of the family structure are diversifying to include parents who are single or of the same sex as their partner along with the traditional heterosexual, married parents. These new family structures pose new questions for the psychoanalytic theories such as the Oedipus complex that require the presence of the mother and the father in the successful development of a child.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Shenkman|first=Geva|date=March 23, 2015|title=Classic psychoanalysis and male same-sex parents: A reexamination of basic concepts.|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|volume=33|issue=4|pages=585\u2013598|doi=10.1037/a0038486}}</ref> However as evidence suggest, children who have been raised by parents of the same sex have shown no difference when compared to children raised in a traditional family structure.<ref name=\":0\" /> The classic theory of the oedipal drama has fallen out of favor in today's society, according to a study by Drescher, having been criticized for its \"negative implications\" towards same sex parents.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is necessary for the psychoanalytic theory to change to keep up with the times and remain relevant. Many psychoanalytic thinkers such as Chodorow and Corbett are working towards changing the Oedipus complex to eliminate \"automatic associations among sex, gender, and the stereotypical psychological functions deriving from these categories\" and make it applicable to today's modern society.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom its Freudian conception, psychoanalysis and its theories have always relied on traditional gender roles to draw itself out. In the 1950s psychologists distinguished different roles in parenting for the mother and father. The role of primary caregiver is assigned to the mother. Motherly love was considered to be unconditional. While the father is assigned the role of secondary caregiver, fatherly love is conditional, responsive to the child's tangible achievements.<ref name=\":0\" /> Recent studies suggest, however, that the notions of male and female gender parenting roles and attributes are a result of culture and continuous practice in psychoanalysis with no biological basis. The Oedipus complex is compromised in the context of modern family structures, as it requires the existence of the notions of masculinity and femininity.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=David|date=Winter 1999|title=Is a gay Oedipus a Trojan horse?

In the case of newer family structures that refute the traditional Oedipus complex, it may mean modifying or discarding the complex completely. Shenkman suggests that a loose interpretation of the Oedipus complex in which the child seeks sexual satisfaction from any parent regardless of [[gender or sex]], would be helpful: \"From this perspective, any parental authority, or institution for that matter, may represent the taboo that gives rise to the complex\". Psychoanalyst Melanie Klein, proposed a theory which broke gender stereotypes, but still kept traditional father-mother family structure. Melanie Klein assigned \"dangerous destructive tendencies not just to the father but also to the mother in her discussion of the child's projective fantasies\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMoreover, from the [[post-modern]] perspective, Grose contends that \"the Oedipus complex isn't really like that. It's more a way of explaining how human beings are [[Socialization|socialised]] ... learning to deal with [[Suffering|disappointment]]\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1232\">Anouchka Grose ''No More Silly Love Songs'' (London, 2010) p. 123</ref> The elementary understanding being that \"You have to stop trying to be everything for your primary carer, and get on with being something for the rest of the world\".<ref>Anouchka Grose ''No More Silly Love Songs'' (London, 2010) p. 124</ref> Nonetheless, the open question remains whether or not such a post-[[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] interpretation \"stretches the Oedipus complex to a point where it almost doesn't look like Freud's any more\".<ref name=\"Didier Eribon 1999\"/>\n\n=== Sociocultural criticism ===\nParent-child and sibling-sibling incestuous unions are almost universally forbidden.<ref>The Tapestry of Culture An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology, Ninth Edition, Abraham Rosman, Paula G. Rubel, Maxine Weisgrau, 2009, AltaMira Press, page 101</ref> An explanation for this [[incest taboo]] is that rather than instinctual sexual desire, there is instinctual sexual aversion against these unions (See [[Westermarck effect]]). [[Steven Pinker]] wrote that \"The idea that boys want to sleep with their mothers strikes most men as the silliest thing they have ever heard. Obviously, it did not seem so to Freud, who wrote that as a boy he once had an erotic reaction to watching his mother dressing. Of note is that [[Amalia Freud|Amalia Nathansohn Freud]] was relatively young during Freud's childhood and thus of reproductive age, and Freud having a [[Wet nurse|wet-nurse]], may not have experienced the early intimacy that would have tipped off his perceptual system that Mrs. Freud was his mother.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=How the mind works|last=1954-|first=Pinker, Steven|date=1997|publisher=Norton|isbn=9780393045352|location=New York|oclc=36379708|url=https://archive.org/details/howmindworks00pink}}</ref>\n\nSome contemporary [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]] agree with the idea of the Oedipus complex to varying degrees; [[Hans Keller]] proposed it is so \"at least in Western societies\";<ref>Hans Keller: ''1975: 1984 Minus 9'' (London, 1975)</ref> and others consider that [[Ethnology|ethnologists]] already have established its temporal and geographic universality.<ref>Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel and Bela Grunberger ''Freud or Reich?: Psychoanalysis and Illusion'' (London, 1986).</ref> Nonetheless, few psychoanalysts disagree that the \"child then entered an Oedipal phase ... [which] involved an acute awareness of a complicated [[Phallic stage|triangle]] involving mother, father, and child\" and that \"both positive and negative Oedipal themes are typically observable in [[Psychosexual development|development]]\".<ref>Glen O. Gabbard ''Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy'' (London 2010) p. 11</ref> Despite evidence of [[Parent\u2013offspring conflict|parent\u2013child conflict]], the evolutionary psychologists [[Martin Daly (professor)|Martin Daly]] and [[Margo Wilson]] note that it is not for sexual possession of the opposite sex-parent; thus, in ''Homicide'' (1988), they proposed that the Oedipus complex yields few testable predictions, because they found no evidence of the Oedipus complex in people.<ref>Martin Daly, Margo Wilson ''Homicide'' (New York: Aldine de Gruyter, 1988).</ref>\n\nIn ''No More Silly Love Songs: A Realist's Guide to Romance'' (2010), [[Anouchka Grose]] says that \"a large number of people, these days believe that [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s Oedipus complex is defunct ... 'disproven', or simply found unnecessary, sometime in the last century\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1232\"/>\n\nIn ''Esquisse pour une autoanalyse'', [[Pierre Bourdieu]] argues that the success of the concept of Oedipus is inseparable from the prestige associated with ancient Greek culture and the relations of domination that are reinforced in the use of this myth. In other words, if Oedipus was Bantu or Baoule, he probably would not have benefited from the coronation of universality. This remark recalls the historically and socially situated character of the founder of psychoanalysis.<ref>Pierre Bourdieu, \"Esquisse pour une auto-analyse\", raisons d'agir, 2004</ref>\n\n== Evidence ==\nA study conducted at Glasgow University potentially supports at least some aspects of the psychoanalytic conception of the Oedipus complex.

The study attempted to distinguish conceptually phenotypic matching from positive sexual imprinting. Phenotypic matching can be understood as an individual's seeking (presumably without conscious awareness) traits in mates that are similar to their own phenotype. Sexual imprinting can be understood as mate preferences that are influenced by experiences and observations with parents/caregivers in early childhood. Adoptive daughters were examined in part to disentangle these two influences. The results of the study support positive sexual imprinting independent of phenotypic matching: \"Judges found significant resemblance on facial traits between daughter's husband and her adoptive father. Furthermore, this effect may be modified by the quality of the father\u2013daughter relationship during childhood. Daughters who received more emotional support from their adoptive father were more likely to choose mates similar to the father than those whose father provided a less positive emotional atmosphere.\" The study's authors also hypothesized that \"sexual imprinting on the observed features of the opposite-sex parent during a sensitive period in early childhood might be responsible for shaping people's later mate-choice criteria,\" a hypothesis that would be at least partially in accordance with Freud's Oedipal model.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1098/rspb.2003.2672|pmid = 15306362|pmc = 1691703|title = Sexual imprinting in human mate choice|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

''Super Mario Maker 2'' introduces new features and course assets, including a new course style and assets based on ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Super Mario#Common elements|Super Mario Maker#Gameplay|label 1=Common elements of the Super Mario series|label 2=Gameplay of Super Mario Maker}}\nLike its predecessor, ''Super Mario Maker 2'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] in which players create their own courses using assets from across the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series and publish them onto the internet for others to play. Players can choose from a selection of prior ''Super Mario'' games to base their course's visual style and gameplay on, including ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', and a newly introduced ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' theme. Gameplay mechanics and enemy behaviors can vary between the styles, with some elements being limited to specific styles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2019/02/13/super-mario-maker-2-announced-for-nintendo-switch|title=Super Mario Maker 2 Announced for Nintendo Switch|last=Marks|first=Tom|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214180013/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/13/super-mario-maker-2-announced-for-nintendo-switch|archive-date=February 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"nlife\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/super_mario_maker_2_confirmed_for_switch_launches_this_june|title=Super Mario Maker 2 Confirmed For Switch, Launches This June|last=Craddock|first=Ryan|work=[[Nintendo Life]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224105057/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/super_mario_maker_2_confirmed_for_switch_launches_this_june|archive-date=February 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2019/02/13/mario-maker-2-is-heading-to-switch|title=Mario Maker 2 Is Heading To Switch|last=Hilliard|first=Kyle|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224105057/https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2019/02/13/mario-maker-2-is-heading-to-switch|archive-date=February 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe sequel adds various assets and tools, including assets and a course theme based on ''Super Mario 3D World''.

Tezuka also states that as players continue to upload levels, he and the development staff will use these creations as a reference for adding content after launch, viewing the dynamic as a give-and-take between developers and consumers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Super Mario Maker 2'' was revealed during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation on February 13, 2019.

Tezuka also states that as players continue to upload levels, he and the development staff will use these creations as a reference for adding content after launch, viewing the dynamic as a give-and-take between developers and consumers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Super Mario Maker 2'' was revealed during a [[Nintendo Direct]] presentation on February 13, 2019.
