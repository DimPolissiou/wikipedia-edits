[[Anna Del Conte]] (''The Gastronomy of Italy'' 2001) found a sausage mentioned in a document of the official body of meat preservers in Bologna dated 1376 that may be mortadella.\n\n==Varieties==\nMortadella Bologna has [[Protected designation of origin|Protected Geographical Indication (IGP)]] status under [[European Union law]], and is the best known world-wide. The zone of production is extensive: as well as [[Emilia-Romagna]] and the neighbouring regions of [[Piedmont]], [[Lombardy]], [[Veneto]], [[Marche]] and Tuscany, it includes Lazio and [[Trentino]].\n\nMortadella di [[Prato]], produced in [[Tuscany]], is also defined by an IGP. It is flavoured with pounded garlic and coloured with [[alchermes]].\n\nThe mortadella of [[Amatrice]], high in the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] of northern [[Lazio]], is lightly smoked.\n\nMortadella di cavallo is made from [[horsemeat]] in [[Albano Laziale]] in [[Lazio]].<ref>[http://www.arsial.it/portalearsial/prd_tipici/scheda_prodotto.asp?tip=0&id=103&bio=0]</ref>\n\nThe American sausage called \"[[Bologna sausage|bologna]]\" is named after the mortadella of Bologna.\n\n==Similar products outside Italy==\n\n===Lusitanic and Hispanic cultures===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n[[File:Mortadela com azeitonas.jpg|thumb|Mortadella with olives from Portugal]]\nMortadella is very popular in Spain and Portugal, where a variety with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[olive]]s is widely consumed, especially in sandwiches. In eastern Spain, the standard mortadella is often referred to as ''mortadela italiana'' (Italian mortadella), to differentiate it from a local variant named ''catalana''.\n\nMortadella is also very popular in Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay and Venezuela, thanks to the Italian immigrants who settled in these countries in the early 20th century. In these countries it is spelled ''mortadela'', and its recipe is quite similar to the traditional Italian, with additional pepper grains.\n\nIn Brazil, [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] has a very popular ''mortadela'' sandwich sold in the Mercado Municipal.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, \"smoked mortadella\" is sometimes confused with commercial salami, or with salami cotto, because cafeterias, panaderias, colmados, and restaurants buy the bulk of whole smoked mortadella. While salami may contain pork, beef, veal and small pieces of fat uniformly distributed within the sausage, mortadella has the traditional larger chunks not so uniformly distributed. Its diameter is much larger than that of hard salami and more closely resembles salami cotto (cooked) in size, hence the confusion of some people. It is smaller in diameter than the traditional mortadella de Bologna because the smoking process causes some shrinkage. It is best served at room temperature to bring out its rich flavour.\n\n===Central, Southern and Eastern Europe===\nIn Romania, a similar cold cut is also known as ''parizer''. It is a type of artisan bologna.\nIn Hungary, a similar product is called, in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], ''mortadella'' and a plain variety called ''pariser'', ''parizer'' or ''p\u00e1rizsi''. The term ''parizer'' is also often used in Bosnia-Herzegovina, while ''parizier'' is used in other territories of the Balkans. The classic Italian ''mortadella'' is widely sold in supermarkets along the entire Adriatic coast. \n\nIn Greece, where there is a smaller version in addition to the regular one, that variety is called Parizaki or Mortadelaki, and in Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and North Macedonia, the product known as ''mortadela'' is widely eaten. \n\nIn Poland, ''mortadela'' slices are sometimes dipped in batter, fried and served with potatoes and salads as a quicker (and cheaper) alternative to traditional [[pork chop]]s.\n\n===Middle East and North Africa===\nIn several countries, such as Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel, [[halal]] or [[kosher]] mortadella is sold, which is made from chicken, beef, or turkey. The Palestinian Siniora brand, established in Jerusalem in 1920<ref>http://www.siniorafood.com/en-us/About-Us/Company-Overview</ref>, is the first in the region, a mortadella with sliced olives, pistachios or pepper.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Farmer Jack \u2014 a Siniora Sons Inc.

A variety that includes olives and pimentos is called [[olive loaf]].\n\nMortadella is one of the three meats in [[Central Grocery|Central Grocery's]] [[Muffaletta]] Sandwich in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States|USA]] along with Holland ham and Genoa salami.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchquarter.com/best-muffulettas-french-quarter-nearby/|title=Best Muffulettas in the French Quarter and Nearby|website=FrenchQuarter.com}}</ref>\n\nMortadella was banned from import into the United States from 1967 to 2000 due to an outbreak of African swine fever in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/13/weekinreview/february-6-12-the-return-of-mortadella.html|title=The Return of Mortadella|date=13 February 2000|work=The New York Times}}</ref> This ban was a pivotal part of the plot of the 1971 film [[Lady Liberty (film)|''La mortadella'']] starring [[Sophia Loren]]. The title for the United States release was ''[[Lady Liberty (film)|Lady Liberty]]''.\n\nThe ban in the United States was lifted due to the [[Veterinary equivalency|Veterinary Equivalency Agreement]] that allowed countries to export products that had been shown to be disease-free as part of an overall agreement that would allow products deemed safe in the United States to be exported to the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/10/world/bologna-journal-coming-to-a-deli-near-you-a-long-taboo-sausage.html|title=Bologna Journal; Coming to a Deli Near You: A Long-Taboo Sausage|date=10 February 2000|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Ukraine and Russia===\nIn Ukraine and Russia, a very similar product is called \"doctor's sausage\" ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u00ab\u0414\u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f\u00bb \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0430}}). However, this product is normally made from a beef and pork mixture, and does not include pieces of fat (sausages with pieces of fat are called \"Lubitelskaya\" and \"Stolichnaya\") or myrtle as a primary spice, being instead flavoured with just [[coriander]] and [[nutmeg]]. It also traditionally contains eggs and milk, which are usually absent in traditional mortadella.\n\n===East Asia===\n''[[Ch\u1ea3 l\u1ee5a]]'' or Vietnamese mortadella is sometimes used as an accompaniment to the Vietnamese dish ''[[b\u00e1nh cu\u1ed1n]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noodlepie.typepad.com/blog/2004/07/stall_1006_banh.html|title=Stall 1006 - Banh Cuon - noodlepie|work=typepad.com}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mortadella sandwich]]\n*[[Curing (food preservation)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Mortadella}}\n* [http://www.salumi-italiani.it/en/all-about-salumi/mortadella-eng.php Istituto per Valorizzazione dei Salumi]: Mortadella {{in lang|it}}\n* [http://www.prodottitipici.com/prodotto/0506/mortadella-di-bologna.htm Mortadella di Bologna] {{in lang|it}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050325132243/http://www.pubit.it/sunti/psi0102a.html Carlo Cantoni and Patrizia Cattaneo, \"La mortadella: aspetti attuali tecnici della sua produzione\"] {{in lang|it}}\n* [http://www.cliffordawright.com/history/sausage.html Clifford A.

A variety that includes olives and pimentos is called [[olive loaf]].\n\nMortadella is one of the three meats in [[Central Grocery|Central Grocery's]] [[Muffaletta]] Sandwich in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States|USA]] along with Holland ham and Genoa salami.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchquarter.com/best-muffulettas-french-quarter-nearby/|title=Best Muffulettas in the French Quarter and Nearby|website=FrenchQuarter.com}}</ref>\n\nMortadella was banned from import into the United States from 1967 to 2000 due to an outbreak of African swine fever in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/13/weekinreview/february-6-12-the-return-of-mortadella.html|title=The Return of Mortadella|date=13 February 2000|work=The New York Times}}</ref> This ban was a pivotal part of the plot of the 1971 film [[Lady Liberty (film)|''La mortadella'']] starring [[Sophia Loren]].

It also traditionally contains eggs and milk, which are usually absent in traditional mortadella.\n\n===East Asia===\n''[[Ch\u1ea3 l\u1ee5a]]'' or Vietnamese mortadella is sometimes used as an accompaniment to the Vietnamese dish ''[[b\u00e1nh cu\u1ed1n]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noodlepie.typepad.com/blog/2004/07/stall_1006_banh.html|title=Stall 1006 - Banh Cuon - noodlepie|work=typepad.com}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mortadella sandwich]]\n*[[Curing (food preservation)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Mortadella}}\n* [http://www.salumi-italiani.it/en/all-about-salumi/mortadella-eng.php Istituto per Valorizzazione dei Salumi]: Mortadella {{in lang|it}}\n* [http://www.prodottitipici.com/prodotto/0506/mortadella-di-bologna.htm Mortadella di Bologna] {{in lang|it}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050325132243/http://www.pubit.it/sunti/psi0102a.html Carlo Cantoni and Patrizia Cattaneo, \"La mortadella: aspetti attuali tecnici della sua produzione\"] {{in lang|it}}\n* [http://www.cliffordawright.com/history/sausage.html Clifford A.

This has proved a difficult question for scholars to determine, because reliable pedigrees do not survive. Additionally, for between three and four decades, the U\u00ed \u00cdmair were probably overkings of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] itself,<ref name=OCorrain1998/> distinct from the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], of which they may also have been overkings, and later briefly the Irish province of [[Munster]], dominated from [[Waterford]], and later still, briefly the English kingdom of [[Mercia]]. In the west of Ireland, the U\u00ed \u00cdmair also supplied at least two kings of [[Limerick]], from which they may have attempted to conquer Munster again.\n\nTwo members are styled [[List of Irish queens and consorts|queens of Ireland]] in the [[Irish annals]] (they were also [[Kingdom of Mide|queen of Mide]] and queen of Munster, respectively), while another was queen of [[Leinster]] (and [[Osraige]]). In the Norse sources, another was [[Olaf Tryggvason|queen of Norway]]. Finally, another may have been [[Kings of Brega|queen of Brega]]. The name ''U\u00ed \u00cdmair'' in [[Old Irish]] means \"grandchildren\" or '''descendants of Ivar''', but the dynasty includes its progenitor and his sons. The Irish annals describe [[\u00cdmar|Ivar]] as the brother of [[Amla\u00edb Conung]] and of [[Auisle]], and the [[Annals of Ulster]] record his [[obituary]] under the year 873, reading: ''Imhar, rex Nordmannorum totius Hibernie & Brittanie, uitam finiuit'' [\"Ivar, king of all the Norse of Ireland and Britain, ended his life\"].<ref>{{Cite AU1}}</ref> Probably the senior leader of the [[Great Heathen Army]],<ref>Woolf (2007), p. 71</ref> Ivar may thus have become the inspiration for the legendary [[Ivar the Boneless]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 865\u2013860), son of [[Ragnar Lodbrok]]. In any event, U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynasts may also have exercised power as [[List of monarchs of East Anglia|overkings of East Anglia]] during their career in Britain.\n\n[[Alex Woolf]] points out it would be a mistake to view the lordship as a \"unitary empire\";<ref>Woolf, Alex (2002) \"Age of Sea-Kings: 900\u20131300\", in: Donald Omand (ed.), ''The Argyll Book'', Edinburgh: Birlinn, pp. 95\u201396.</ref> it was, rather, a collection of lordships ruled by the same kindred, with only varying degrees of unity depending on the political circumstances of the moment and the charisma of individual leaders. Especially in the early period, a great portion of the dynasty's wealth, probably the majority, came from the [[slavery|international slave trade]], both as slavers themselves and from the taxation of it,<ref>Valante, ''passim''</ref> for which they were infamous in their time. In this role they star as the principal antagonists in the early 12th-century Irish epic political tract ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib|The War of the Irish with the Foreigners]]'', although the account is exaggerated.<ref>ed. & tr. [[James Henthorn Todd]] (1867)</ref>\n\nOne of the greatest dynasties of the [[Viking Age]], the U\u00ed \u00cdmair were at their height the most fearsome and wide-reaching [[political power|power]] in the [[British Isles]] and perhaps beyond.<ref>The dynasty may have retained influence in their Scandinavian homelands, and also held some in [[Normandy]]. For both these areas our sources are very poor.</ref> However, unlike the contemporary [[Rurikids]] in the East they ultimately failed to make any long-lasting territorial gains of significance and are considered{{by whom|date=January 2016}} a strategic failure, despite their considerable economic and political influence.<ref>\n\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, Downham, Woolf, Valante\n</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Ancestral homeland==\n\nSome historians believe \u00cdmar and Ivar the Boneless to be identical, others claim they are two different individuals. According to Irish annals, \u00cdmar was the son of Gofraid (also Goffridh, Gothfraid or Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r), who was the king of Lochlann. The Norwegians at this point were often referred to as Lochlanns by the Irish. Lochlann was widely accepted among scholars as being identical to Norway, recently however this has been questioned, among others by Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in. His and others' theory is that Lochlann was the \"viking Scotland\" (Norse/Norwegian settlements on the Scottish islands and northern mainland). Whether the Irish annals used the term Lochlann to refer to Norway or to the Norse settlements in Scotland is still a matter of debate, however by the 11th century the term had come to mean Norway.<ref name=\"ucc.ie\">http://www.ucc.ie/celt/Vikings%20in%20Scotland%20and%20Ireland.pdf</ref> According to Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in there is no evidence that any branch of the royal Danish dynasty ruled in Ireland. He also claims that \u00cdmar's brother, Amla\u00edb Conung (the name \"Conung\" is from the Old Norse konungr and simply means \"king\"), who often has been identified as part of the royal Norwegian dynasty (Ynglingene), was in fact not. He argues that both \u00cdmar and his brothers were part of a Norse dynasty centered in and around the Scottish mainland.<ref name=\"ucc.ie\"/>\n\nThe Norwegian historian Kim Hjardar and archaeologist Vegard Vike claim that \u00cdmar is the same person as the Dane Ivar the Boneless, and that he and the Norwegian chieftain Amla\u00edb Conung (Olaf the White) arrived in Ireland as leaders of a coalition of Vikings whose goal was to take control over the Viking settlements in Ireland. When the Irish annals describe \u00cdmar and Amla\u00edb Conung as brothers, Hjardar and Vike claims that this has to be interpreted as a metaphor for \"warrior brothers\" or \"brothers in arms\".<ref>Kim Hjardar & Vegard Vike, Vikings at War, p.224-226.</ref>\n\n==Dynasts==\nThe following list contains only members mentioned in the [[Irish annals]] and other reliable and semi-reliable sources, such as the ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]'', and among those only the ones who can be placed in the pedigree with relative confidence. Thus it is by no means complete. Among recent developments in scholarship it has been argued that the historical king of Northumbria contributing to the character of [[Eric Bloodaxe]] was actually an U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynast.<ref>Downham 2004, ''passim''; 2007, ''passim''</ref>\n\nFirst proposed by [[James Henthorn Todd]] in 1867,<ref>Todd 1867</ref> and most recently considered by [[Alex Woolf]] and Clare Downham, it is possible the U\u00ed \u00cdmair were peculiar in that some early members, and possibly the entire known later dynasty, descended from the founder via the female line.<ref>Woolf (2007) p. 131; Downham (2007) p. 34. The latter speculates that the known grandsons of \u00cdmar, who lack a patronymic, and are referred to as \"ua \u00cdmair\", may have been the \"children of a daughter (or daughters) of \u00cdvarr\". She provides a note that \"Alex Woolf has put forward this idea in conversation\".</ref>\n\nAfter various authors. Birthdates are unknown.

He was either a descendant of [[Ivar of Waterford]] (died 1000) or [[Gofraid mac Arailt]] (died 989). That of [[Cacht ingen Ragnaill]], Queen of [[Donnchad mac Briain]], may or may not depend upon Echmarcach's.\n\n\n===Family tree===\n{{Late Ui Imair family tree}}\n\n==Later Waterford and Limerick==\nThe independent dynasty of Waterford founded or continued by [[Ivar of Waterford]] (died 1000) cannot be linked genealogically to the 'central'  line of Dublin kings, but [[James Henthorn Todd]] gave him a descent from [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair]], who never ruled there.<ref>Todd, p. 294. He is followed by Valante, p. 178.</ref> Their claim to Dublin and the names of their dynasts suggest they did belong to the dynasty.<ref>Downham, p. 56-7</ref>\n\nLike in the case of the late Waterford dynasty, the pedigree of the last Norse to rule in Limerick is also uncertain. [[Ivar of Limerick]] (died 977), and surnamed Ua h\u00cdmair, features prominently in the early 12th century saga ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]'', although he appears less in the annals, which are [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunose]] and in general poorer for western Ireland. In any case he and/or the Waterford dynasty are probably survived today through intermarriage with the [[O'Donovan family]], verifiably associated with both and known for their use of U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynastic names in medieval times. A notable sept of the O'Donovans known as the [[\u00cdmar Ua Donnub\u00e1in|Sliocht \u00cdomhair]] or \"Seed of Ivor\" survived into early modern times. It is also periodically claimed that some of the family may even be male line descendants of Ivar of Waterford, a variant of which (through his son Donndub\u00e1n) actually appeared in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' for a few decades.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=knfW-aSfoaQC&pg=PA766 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]''</ref> This remains unverified and the family do not make this last claim themselves. All (surviving) septs profess a Gaelic lineage.\n\n==Loss of Dublin==\nHow long the U\u00ed \u00cdmair remained in Dublin after losing it to the [[U\u00ed Cheinnselaig]] in 1052 is unknown. Following the death of [[Diarmait mac Ma\u00edl na mB\u00f3]] in 1072 the kingship appears to have been held by one [[Gofraid mac Amla\u00edb meic Ragnaill]], who may or may not have been a candidate supported by [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain]]. While it has been argued he was installed by Toirdelbach,<ref>\u00d3 Cr\u00f3inin</ref> the annals themselves make no such statement, which but for one only briefly report Gofraid's death in 1075, and variously style him King of the Foreigners and King of Dublin. But according to the [[Annals of Inisfallen]] \"Gofraid grandson of Ragnall, king of \u00c1th Cliath, was banished over sea by Tairdelbach Ua Briain, and he died beyond the sea, having assembled a great fleet [to come] to Ireland.\"<ref>{{Cite AI}}</ref> So Gofraid, regardless of how he took the throne, thought he had some chance of reestablishing the dynasty independent in Dublin in spite of the Gaels. [[Godred Crovan]] may have been successful for a period after him.\n\n==Later Ireland in general, and intermarriage==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}\nThe U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynasty was the precursor of a number of families in Ireland, both Gaelic and Norse speaking.\n\nHowever, the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] led to the destruction \nof a vast majority of the medieval Norse-Irish and Gaelic aristocracy alike. This destruction was completed with the later [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]].\n\nNevertheless, dense clusters of [[given name]]s strongly associated with the Norse dynasty can be found in notionally Gaelic families, in the great genealogical compilations of [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]] and [[C\u00fa Choigcr\u00edche \u00d3 Cl\u00e9irigh]], and in various other sources. And, while the dynasty was concentrated in Dublin, Waterford and Limerick, and thus in the southern half of Ireland, Gaelic families later using their given names with great frequency are found mainly in the northern half of Ireland: their pedigrees associate them with the [[Connachta]], [[U\u00ed Maine]], and [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]]. None of these northern dynasties have a documented history of willing association with the U\u00ed \u00cdmair, or in the case of the first two any association at all. The U\u00ed \u00cdmair are only documented intermarrying with the [[Kingdom of Ossory|Osraighe]] (the FitzPatricks), [[Laigin]], [[O'Brien dynasty]], the Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill [[Clann Cholm\u00e1in]] and [[S\u00edl n\u00c1edo Sl\u00e1ine]] and the aforementioned O'Donovans. In any event, the one long surviving source that might have contained pedigrees of surviving septs of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair themselves was a section in the [[Great Book of Lecan]]. This section, specifically focused on the pedigrees and doings of the Norse families of Ireland, was still in existence in the 17th century, as reported by Mac Firbis himself, but has since become lost.<ref>[[Alexander Bugge]] (ed. & tr.), of [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]], ''[https://archive.org/details/onfomoriansnorse00macfuoft On the Fomorians and the Norsemen]''.

This has proved a difficult question for scholars to determine, because reliable pedigrees do not survive. Additionally, for between three and four decades, the U\u00ed \u00cdmair were probably overkings of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] itself,<ref name=OCorrain1998/> distinct from the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], of which they may also have been overkings, and later briefly the Irish province of [[Munster]], dominated from [[Waterford]], and later still, briefly the English kingdom of [[Mercia]]. In the west of Ireland, the U\u00ed \u00cdmair also supplied at least two kings of [[Limerick]], from which they may have attempted to conquer Munster again.\n\nTwo members are styled [[List of Irish queens and consorts|queens of Ireland]] in the [[Irish annals]] (they were also [[Kingdom of Mide|queen of Mide]] and queen of Munster, respectively), while another was queen of [[Leinster]] (and [[Osraige]]). In the Norse sources, another was [[Olaf Tryggvason|queen of Norway]]. Finally, another may have been [[Kings of Brega|queen of Brega]]. The name ''U\u00ed \u00cdmair'' in [[Old Irish]] means \"grandchildren\" or '''descendants of Ivar''', but the dynasty includes its progenitor and his sons. The Irish annals describe [[\u00cdmar|Ivar]] as the brother of [[Amla\u00edb Conung]] and of [[Auisle]], and the [[Annals of Ulster]] record his [[obituary]] under the year 873, reading: ''Imhar, rex Nordmannorum totius Hibernie & Brittanie, uitam finiuit'' [\"Ivar, king of all the Norse of Ireland and Britain, ended his life\"].<ref>{{Cite AU1}}</ref> Probably the senior leader of the [[Great Heathen Army]],<ref>Woolf (2007), p. 71</ref> Ivar may thus have become the inspiration for the legendary [[Ivar the Boneless]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 865\u2013860), son of [[Ragnar Lodbrok]]. In any event, U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynasts may also have exercised power as [[List of monarchs of East Anglia|overkings of East Anglia]] during their career in Britain.\n\n[[Alex Woolf]] points out it would be a mistake to view the lordship as a \"unitary empire\";<ref>Woolf, Alex (2002) \"Age of Sea-Kings: 900\u20131300\", in: Donald Omand (ed.), ''The Argyll Book'', Edinburgh: Birlinn, pp. 95\u201396.</ref> it was, rather, a collection of lordships ruled by the same kindred, with only varying degrees of unity depending on the political circumstances of the moment and the charisma of individual leaders. Especially in the early period, a great portion of the dynasty's wealth, probably the majority, came from the [[slavery|international slave trade]], both as slavers themselves and from the taxation of it,<ref>Valante, ''passim''</ref> for which they were infamous in their time. In this role they star as the principal antagonists in the early 12th-century Irish epic political tract ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib|The War of the Irish with the Foreigners]]'', although the account is exaggerated.<ref>ed. & tr. [[James Henthorn Todd]] (1867)</ref>\n\nOne of the greatest dynasties of the [[Viking Age]], the U\u00ed \u00cdmair were at their height the most fearsome and wide-reaching [[political power|power]] in the [[British Isles]] and perhaps beyond.<ref>The dynasty may have retained influence in their Scandinavian homelands, and also held some in [[Normandy]]. For both these areas our sources are very poor.</ref> However, unlike the contemporary [[Rurikids]] in the East they ultimately failed to make any long-lasting territorial gains of significance and are considered{{by whom|date=January 2016}} a strategic failure, despite their considerable economic and political influence.<ref>\n\u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, Downham, Woolf, Valante\n</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Ancestral homeland==\n\nSome historians believe \u00cdmar and Ivar the Boneless to be identical, others claim they are two different individuals. According to Irish annals, \u00cdmar was the son of Gofraid (also Goffridh, Gothfraid or Gu\u00f0r\u00f8\u00f0r), who was the king of Lochlann. The Norwegians at this point were often referred to as Lochlanns by the Irish. Lochlann was widely accepted among scholars as being identical to Norway, recently however this has been questioned, among others by Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in. His and others' theory is that Lochlann was the \"viking Scotland\" (Norse/Norwegian settlements on the Scottish islands and northern mainland). Whether the Irish annals used the term Lochlann to refer to Norway or to the Norse settlements in Scotland is still a matter of debate, however by the 11th century the term had come to mean Norway.<ref name=\"ucc.ie\">http://www.ucc.ie/celt/Vikings%20in%20Scotland%20and%20Ireland.pdf</ref> According to Donnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in there is no evidence that any branch of the royal Danish dynasty ruled in Ireland. He also claims that \u00cdmar's brother, Amla\u00edb Conung (the name \"Conung\" is from the Old Norse konungr and simply means \"king\"), who often has been identified as part of the royal Norwegian dynasty (Ynglingene), was in fact not. He argues that both \u00cdmar and his brothers were part of a Norse dynasty centered in and around the Scottish mainland.<ref name=\"ucc.ie\"/>\n\nThe Norwegian historian Kim Hjardar and archaeologist Vegard Vike claim that \u00cdmar is the same person as the Dane Ivar the Boneless, and that he and the Norwegian chieftain Amla\u00edb Conung (Olaf the White) arrived in Ireland as leaders of a coalition of Vikings whose goal was to take control over the Viking settlements in Ireland. When the Irish annals describe \u00cdmar and Amla\u00edb Conung as brothers, Hjardar and Vike claims that this has to be interpreted as a metaphor for \"warrior brothers\" or \"brothers in arms\".<ref>Kim Hjardar & Vegard Vike, Vikings at War, p.224-226.</ref>\n\n==Dynasts==\nThe following list contains only members mentioned in the [[Irish annals]] and other reliable and semi-reliable sources, such as the ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]'', and among those only the ones who can be placed in the pedigree with relative confidence. Thus it is by no means complete. Among recent developments in scholarship it has been argued that the historical king of Northumbria contributing to the character of [[Eric Bloodaxe]] was actually an U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynast.<ref>Downham 2004, ''passim''; 2007, ''passim''</ref>\n\nFirst proposed by [[James Henthorn Todd]] in 1867,<ref>Todd 1867</ref> and most recently considered by [[Alex Woolf]] and Clare Downham, it is possible the U\u00ed \u00cdmair were peculiar in that some early members, and possibly the entire known later dynasty, descended from the founder via the female line.<ref>Woolf (2007) p. 131; Downham (2007) p. 34. The latter speculates that the known grandsons of \u00cdmar, who lack a patronymic, and are referred to as \"ua \u00cdmair\", may have been the \"children of a daughter (or daughters) of \u00cdvarr\". She provides a note that \"Alex Woolf has put forward this idea in conversation\".</ref>\n\nAfter various authors. Birthdates are unknown.

He was either a descendant of [[Ivar of Waterford]] (died 1000) or [[Gofraid mac Arailt]] (died 989). That of [[Cacht ingen Ragnaill]], Queen of [[Donnchad mac Briain]], may or may not depend upon Echmarcach's.\n\n\n===Family tree===\n{{Late Ui Imair family tree}}\n\n==Later Waterford and Limerick==\nThe independent dynasty of Waterford founded or continued by [[Ivar of Waterford]] (died 1000) cannot be linked genealogically to the 'central'  line of Dublin kings, but [[James Henthorn Todd]] gave him a descent from [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair]], who never ruled there.<ref>Todd, p. 294. He is followed by Valante, p. 178.</ref> Their claim to Dublin and the names of their dynasts suggest they did belong to the dynasty.<ref>Downham, p. 56-7</ref>\n\nLike in the case of the late Waterford dynasty, the pedigree of the last Norse to rule in Limerick is also uncertain. [[Ivar of Limerick]] (died 977), and surnamed Ua h\u00cdmair, features prominently in the early 12th century saga ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]'', although he appears less in the annals, which are [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunose]] and in general poorer for western Ireland. In any case he and/or the Waterford dynasty are probably survived today through intermarriage with the [[O'Donovan family]], verifiably associated with both and known for their use of U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynastic names in medieval times. A notable sept of the O'Donovans known as the [[\u00cdmar Ua Donnub\u00e1in|Sliocht \u00cdomhair]] or \"Seed of Ivor\" survived into early modern times. It is also periodically claimed that some of the family may even be male line descendants of Ivar of Waterford, a variant of which (through his son Donndub\u00e1n) actually appeared in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' for a few decades.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=knfW-aSfoaQC&pg=PA766 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]''</ref> This remains unverified and the family do not make this last claim themselves. All (surviving) septs profess a Gaelic lineage.\n\n==Loss of Dublin==\nHow long the U\u00ed \u00cdmair remained in Dublin after losing it to the [[U\u00ed Cheinnselaig]] in 1052 is unknown. Following the death of [[Diarmait mac Ma\u00edl na mB\u00f3]] in 1072 the kingship appears to have been held by one [[Gofraid mac Amla\u00edb meic Ragnaill]], who may or may not have been a candidate supported by [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain]]. While it has been argued he was installed by Toirdelbach,<ref>\u00d3 Cr\u00f3inin</ref> the annals themselves make no such statement, which but for one only briefly report Gofraid's death in 1075, and variously style him King of the Foreigners and King of Dublin. But according to the [[Annals of Inisfallen]] \"Gofraid grandson of Ragnall, king of \u00c1th Cliath, was banished over sea by Tairdelbach Ua Briain, and he died beyond the sea, having assembled a great fleet [to come] to Ireland.\"<ref>{{Cite AI}}</ref> So Gofraid, regardless of how he took the throne, thought he had some chance of reestablishing the dynasty independent in Dublin in spite of the Gaels. [[Godred Crovan]] may have been successful for a period after him.\n\n==Later Ireland in general, and intermarriage==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}\nThe U\u00ed \u00cdmair dynasty was the precursor of a number of families in Ireland, both Gaelic and Norse speaking.\n\nHowever, the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] led to the destruction \nof a vast majority of the medieval Norse-Irish and Gaelic aristocracy alike. This destruction was completed with the later [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]].\n\nNevertheless, dense clusters of [[given name]]s strongly associated with the Norse dynasty can be found in notionally Gaelic families, in the great genealogical compilations of [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]] and [[C\u00fa Choigcr\u00edche \u00d3 Cl\u00e9irigh]], and in various other sources. And, while the dynasty was concentrated in Dublin, Waterford and Limerick, and thus in the southern half of Ireland, Gaelic families later using their given names with great frequency are found mainly in the northern half of Ireland: their pedigrees associate them with the [[Connachta]], [[U\u00ed Maine]], and [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]]. None of these northern dynasties have a documented history of willing association with the U\u00ed \u00cdmair, or in the case of the first two any association at all. The U\u00ed \u00cdmair are only documented intermarrying with the [[Kingdom of Ossory|Osraighe]] (the FitzPatricks), [[Laigin]], [[O'Brien dynasty]], the Southern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill [[Clann Cholm\u00e1in]] and [[S\u00edl n\u00c1edo Sl\u00e1ine]] and the aforementioned O'Donovans. In any event, the one long surviving source that might have contained pedigrees of surviving septs of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair themselves was a section in the [[Great Book of Lecan]]. This section, specifically focused on the pedigrees and doings of the Norse families of Ireland, was still in existence in the 17th century, as reported by Mac Firbis himself, but has since become lost.<ref>[[Alexander Bugge]] (ed. & tr.), of [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]], ''[https://archive.org/details/onfomoriansnorse00macfuoft On the Fomorians and the Norsemen]''.

This is most commonly seen in [[CMOS]] circuits, and also in [[transistor\u2013transistor logic]] with totem-pole output. The output is said to either be low (grounded), high, or open ([[High impedance|high-''Z'']]). In this configuration the output of the circuit is actually not connected to any voltage reference at all. Where the signal is usually grounded to a certain reference, or at a certain voltage level, the state is said to be high impedance because it is open and serves its own reference. Thus, the actual voltage level is sometimes unpredictable.\n[[File:Ternary numeral system.png|thumb|400px|right|Visualization of ternary numeral system invented in 2010]] \nA rare \"ternary point\" is used to denote fractional parts of an [[inning]] in [[baseball]]. Since each inning consists of three [[Out (baseball)|outs]], each out is considered one third of an inning and is denoted as '''.1'''. For example, if a player pitched all of the 4th, 5th and 6th innings, plus 2 outs of the 7th inning, his [[Innings pitched]] column for that game would be listed as '''3.2''', meaning {{frac|3|2|3}}. In this usage, only the fractional part of the number is written in ternary form.\n\nTernary numbers can be used to convey self\u2013similar structures like the [[Sierpinski triangle]] or the [[Cantor set]] conveniently. Additionally, it turns out that the ternary representation is useful for defining the Cantor set and related point sets, because of the way the Cantor set is constructed. The Cantor set consists of the points from 0 to 1 that have a ternary expression that does not contain any instance of the digit 1.<ref name=\"Soltanifar_2006_1\"/><ref name=\"Soltanifar_2006_2\"/> Any terminating expansion in the ternary system is equivalent to the expression that is identical up to the term preceding the last non-zero term followed by the term one less than the last nonzero term of the first expression, followed by an infinite tail of twos. For example: 0.1020 is equivalent to 0.1012222... because the expansions are the same until the \"two\" of the first expression, the two was decremented in the second expansion, and trailing zeros were replaced with trailing twos in the second expression.\n\nTernary is the integer base with the lowest [[radix economy]], followed closely by [[Binary numeral system|binary]] and [[Quaternary numeral system|quaternary]]. It has been used for some computing systems because of this efficiency.

This is most commonly seen in [[CMOS]] circuits, and also in [[transistor\u2013transistor logic]] with totem-pole output. The output is said to either be low (grounded), high, or open ([[High impedance|high-''Z'']]). In this configuration the output of the circuit is actually not connected to any voltage reference at all. Where the signal is usually grounded to a certain reference, or at a certain voltage level, the state is said to be high impedance because it is open and serves its own reference. Thus, the actual voltage level is sometimes unpredictable.\n[[File:Ternary numeral system.png|thumb|400px|right|Visualization of ternary numeral sytem invented in 2010]] \nA rare \"ternary point\" is used to denote fractional parts of an [[inning]] in [[baseball]]. Since each inning consists of three [[Out (baseball)|outs]], each out is considered one third of an inning and is denoted as '''.1'''. For example, if a player pitched all of the 4th, 5th and 6th innings, plus 2 outs of the 7th inning, his [[Innings pitched]] column for that game would be listed as '''3.2''', meaning {{frac|3|2|3}}. In this usage, only the fractional part of the number is written in ternary form.\n\nTernary numbers can be used to convey self\u2013similar structures like the [[Sierpinski triangle]] or the [[Cantor set]] conveniently. Additionally, it turns out that the ternary representation is useful for defining the Cantor set and related point sets, because of the way the Cantor set is constructed. The Cantor set consists of the points from 0 to 1 that have a ternary expression that does not contain any instance of the digit 1.<ref name=\"Soltanifar_2006_1\"/><ref name=\"Soltanifar_2006_2\"/> Any terminating expansion in the ternary system is equivalent to the expression that is identical up to the term preceding the last non-zero term followed by the term one less than the last nonzero term of the first expression, followed by an infinite tail of twos. For example: 0.1020 is equivalent to 0.1012222... because the expansions are the same until the \"two\" of the first expression, the two was decremented in the second expansion, and trailing zeros were replaced with trailing twos in the second expression.\n\nTernary is the integer base with the lowest [[radix economy]], followed closely by [[Binary numeral system|binary]] and [[Quaternary numeral system|quaternary]]. It has been used for some computing systems because of this efficiency. It is also used to represent three-option ''trees'', such as phone menu systems, which allow a simple path to any branch.\n\nA form of [[redundant binary representation]] called [[balanced ternary]] or [[signed-digit representation]] is sometimes used in low-level software and hardware to accomplish fast addition of integers because it can eliminate carries.<ref name=\"Phatak_1994\"/>\n\n===Binary-coded ternary===\nSimulation of ternary computers using binary computers, or interfacing between ternary and binary computers, can involve use of binary-coded ternary (BCT) numbers, with two bits used to encode each trit.<ref name=\"Frieder_1975\"/><ref name=\"Parhami_2013\"/> BCT encoding is analogous to [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD) encoding.

MTS was the radiotelephone equivalent of land dial phone service.\n\nThe Mobile Telephone Service was one of the earliest mobile telephone standards. It was operator assisted in both directions, meaning that if one were called from a [[public switched telephone network|land line]] the call would be routed to a mobile operator, who would route it to one's phone. Similarly, to make an outbound call one had to go through the mobile operator, who would ask for the mobile number and the number to be called, and would then place the call.\n\nThis service originated with the [[Bell System]], and was first used in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on June 17, 1946.  The original equipment weighed {{convert|80|lb|kg}}, and there were initially only 3 channels for all the users in the metropolitan area, later more licenses were added bringing the total to 32 channels across 3 bands (See [[IMTS frequencies]]).

The service uses technology that has been manufacturer discontinued for more than three decades.\n\nThe driver for replacement in most of North America, particularly large cities, was congestion, the inability of the network to carry more than two dozen channels in a geographic area. Cellular service resolved this congestion problem very effectively, especially since cellular frequencies, typically UHF, do not reach as far as VHF frequencies and can therefore be reused. The ability of a cellular system to use signal strength to choose channels and split cells into smaller units also helps expand channel capacity.\n\nThe driver for replacement in remote areas, however, is not network congestion, but [[obsolescence]]. Because the equipment is no longer manufactured, companies still using the service must struggle to keep their equipment operating, either by cannibalising from retired equipment or improvising solutions. Due to insufficient traffic, cellular is not a cost-effective replacement. Currently, the only viable solution is [[Satellite phone|satellite telephony]], as the small number of \"base stations\" which orbit the planet serve large geographic regions as they pass over. Cost, however, has been an issue, and the replacement has become acceptable to VHF mobile customers gradually, as the cost of satellite telephony has been dropping and will continue to drop.\n\nMany MTS [[frequency|frequencies]] are now used for local [[Paging (telecommunications)|paging]] services. They are only found in some parts of rural North America, having been replaced in most areas by cellular service in the 1980s or later.\n\n==Operation==\nAll calls were placed by a suitably equipped telephone operator.\n\nOutgoing calls were placed when the operator connected to a base station (originally using a cord board, but by the 1990s could be done by dialing a code sequence from a [[TOPS (Nortel)|TOPS]] position), then announced the call over the channel (giving the channel's name first), e.g.,\n\n: ''\"Dawson Channel calling 2M-2368, 2M-2368, 2M-2368.\"''\n\nThe page would usually be repeated twice more after a pause. The called party had to have their unit on and the volume set at a level that allowed them to notice a call and then listen to the called number. If the called party heard an incoming call, they would then use the microphone to announce they were receiving the call, and the operator would allow the two parties to speak, monitoring for the end of the call and marking a manual ticket for billing.\n\nThe format of such \"voice-called\" mobile customer numbers varied by jurisdiction. [[Telus|B.C. Tel]], for example, used seven-character numbers starting with N or H, a digit (often 1), then five more digits for the individual customer. [[Telus|AGT]] in Alberta used seven-character numbers.\n\nSoon enough, customer equipment, \"selective call\", was developed that had a built-in circuit that could be programmed to recognize a five-digit code as its own, in a manner similar to IMTS systems and crude compared to cellular phones. The phone company would assign the customer a number and the customer would have it programmed into the set by the phone company or by a dealer.\n\nThe operator would connect to the base station by cord board and key the five-digit number; in the 1990s, phone operators at TOPS positions would key the five digits after dialing the code to initiate the call and then identify the base station; a typical TOPS operator code would consist of a two digit sequence for voice-call or selective call, a three digit sequence for the base station, then the customer number.\n\nThe base station would signal the five digit sequence; any and all radios tuned to that base station would detect the sequence and compare it with their own; if it matched, the unit would signal its user with a bell or buzzer, and the user could then answer and announce the identity of their unit, similar to how a voice-call user would respond.\n\nCalls from mobile units to a base station were started by signaling the operator by pressing the microphone button. The operator would plug into the channel (automated TOPS systems routed the incoming call through the normal queue), announce availability and the channel name, and the customer would identify their mobile number. (Security systems were sometimes adopted later to prevent fraud, by the customer giving a confidential number. In an automated connection to the operator, other radios on the base station could hear the transmission from the station, not what the radio user was transmitting.) The customer would then specify the details of their call, either to another mobile or to a landline number, which the operator would then place. The call was manually ticketed prior to the use of TOPS, and automatically ticketed if the mobile user was automatically connected to the TOPS operator.\n\nVery few companies automated MTS to use TOPS as most were able to discontinue MTS services due to the reasons above: they could not meet the service demand except by switching to cellular. [[Northwestel]] was one company still offering MTS that tied the base stations into TOPS.\n\nA variant of MTS used short-wave frequencies, and was known as High Frequency or High Frequency-Single Sideband, so named for using frequencies between 3 and 30&nbsp;MHz. These services required far fewer base stations and were used to reach distant locations over vast territories. The drawback was that the frequencies were extremely noisy from various interference, and were subject to propagation problems due to time of day, mostly due to the sun's effect on the ionosphere. Northwestel, which discontinued the service shortly after 2000, could not tie this system into TOPS, and had to aurally monitor the channels using speakers to listen for incoming calls.\n\nFor billing purposes, many MTS base stations were identified with a very close-by rate center of an automatic exchange. However, if there was no nearby rate center, they became an \"Other Place Point\". Phone companies typically identified these, and single points such as an individual telephone in a rural area, using a six-digit combination of 88T-XXX, where T is a digit from 6 to 9, and X is any digit 0-9. For example, Fox Lake, Yukon Territory, was 889-949. This combination would serve the same purpose as the [[North American Numbering Plan|NANP]] area code and central office code, with its own latitudinal-longitudinal coordinates, to allow a distance to be calculated for rating of a call. This coding system, which was in its zenith of usage during the 1980s and 1990s, was rendered unusable when the North American Numbering Plan administrator withdrew the 88X codes for future use as toll free (e.g. 1-800-) services. \n\nBy the end of the 1990s, very few companies still had need of the Other Place Point codes, and other rating arrangements were made. For example, Northwestel would use the nearest exchange for calls to its mobile points from other phone companies, and would code the locations in its billing software for calls within the company's operating territory. The rate impact was negligible for calls over longer distances.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Mobile radio telephone]]\n* [[History of mobile phones]]\n* [[Radiotelephone]] - (A communications device for transmission of speech over radio)\n* [[Non-dialable point]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wb6nvh.com/MTSfiles/Carphone1.htm The first car telephones, retrieved 2010 Dec 6]\n\n{{Mobile telecommunications standards}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications in the United States]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications in Canada]]\n[[Category:Wireless communication systems]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=December 2010}}\nThe '''Mobile Telephone Service''' ('''MTS''') was a pre-[[cellular network|cellular]] [[Very high frequency|VHF]] radio system that linked to the [[Public Switched Telephone Network]] (PSTN).

However, if there was no nearby rate center, they became an \"Other Place Point\". Phone companies typically identified these, and single points such as an individual telephone in a rural area, using a six-digit combination of 88T-XXX, where T is a digit from 6 to 9, and X is any digit 0-9. For example, Fox Lake, Yukon Territory, was 889-949. This combination would serve the same purpose as the [[North American Numbering Plan|NANP]] area code and central office code, with its own latitudinal-longitudinal coordinates, to allow a distance to be calculated for rating of a call. This coding system, which was in its zenith of usage during the 1980s and 1990s, was rendered unusable when the North American Numbering Plan administrator withdrew the 88X codes for future use as toll free (e.g. 1-800-) services. \n\nBy the end of the 1990s, very few companies still had need of the Other Place Point codes, and other rating arrangements were made. For example, Northwestel would use the nearest exchange for calls to its mobile points from other phone companies, and would code the locations in its billing software for calls within the company's operating territory. The rate impact was negligible for calls over longer distances.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Mobile radio telephone]]\n* [[History of mobile phones]]\n* [[Radiotelephone]] - (A communications device for transmission of speech over radio)\n* [[Non-dialable point]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wb6nvh.com/MTSfiles/Carphone1.htm The first car telephones, retrieved 2010 Dec 6]\n\n{{Mobile telecommunications standards}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n[[Category:Telecommunications in the United States]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications in Canada]]\n", "name_user": "Yerachmiel Coinblatt", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Telephone_Service"}

The theory that most of the Eurasian mixed race Hong Kong people are descended only from Tanka women and European men, and not ordinary Cantonese women, is backed up by other researchers who pointed out that Tanka women freely consorted with foreigners due to the fact that they were not bound by the same Confucian traditions as the Cantonese, and having a relationship with European men was advantageous for Tanka women. The ordinary Cantonese women did not sleep with European men, the Eurasian population was formed only from Tanka and European admixture.<ref>{{cite book |author=Meiqi Lee |title=Being Eurasian: memories across racial divides |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVGd71y1Y-0C&pg=PA262|year=2004 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |isbn=962-209-671-9 |page=262 |quote=EJ Eitel, in the late 1890s, claims that the 'half-caste population in Hong Kong ' were from the earliest days of the settlement almost exclusively the offspring of liaisons between European men and women of outcaste ethnic groups such as Tanka (Europe in China, 169). Lethbridge refutes the theory saying it was based on a 'myth' propagated by xenophobic Cantonese to account for the establishment of the Hong Kong Eurasian community. Carl Smith's study in the late 1960s on the protected women seems, to some degree, support Eitel's theory. Smith says that the Tankas experienced certain restrictions within the traditional Chinese social structure. Custom precluded their intermarriage with the Cantonese and Hakka-speaking populations. The Tanka women did not have bound feet. Their opportunities for settlement on shore were limited. They were hence not as closely tied to Confucian ethics as other Chinese ethnic groups. Being a group marginal to the traditional Chinese society of the Puntis (Cantonese), they did not have the same social pressure in dealing with Europeans (CT Smith, Chung Chi Bulletin, 27). 'Living under the protection of a foreigner,' says Smith, 'could be a ladder to financial security, if not respectability, for some of the Tanka boat girls' (13 ).}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Maria Jaschok |author2=Suzanne Miers |editor1=Maria Jaschok |editor2=Suzanne Miers |title=Women and Chinese patriarchy: submission, servitude, and escape |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f5o_t7VxHYAC&pg=PA223|year=1994 |publisher=Zed Books |isbn=1-85649-126-9 |page=223 |quote=He states that they had a near- monopoly of the trade in girls and women, and that: The half-caste population in Hong Kong were, from the earliest days of the settlement of the Colony and down to the present day, almost exclusively the offspring of these Tan-ka people.

Toasts to the emperor and president were drank with all the honors, and the company did not disperse until a very late hour.  Our next picture shows a Chinese tanka boat.

On her voyage, the Powhatan touched at Singapore, the capital of a small island at the southern extremity of Malacca. The town stands on a point of land near a bay, affording a safe anchorage at all seasons, and commanding the navigation of the Straits of Malacca. While the Powhatan lay at anchor here, the captain permitted two jugglers to come on board to gratify the wishes of the sailors, by exhibiting their skill in legerdemain, which art they profess in a wonderful degree of perfection. The feat of swallowing a sword was performed, as exhibited in our fifth engraving. But as the weapon belonged to the juggler, the men suspected it was prepared for the purpose, and that the blade consisted of running slides, which, by the pressure of the tongue to the point, would be forced into the hilt. The Malay, however, was determined to confound the doubters, and taking up a piece of rough cast iron from the armorer's forge, swallowed it with as much ease and facility as he did the sword. The performances ended with a lively dance executed by two cobras, to the accompaniment of harsh sounds from a trumpet played by an assistant.  From Singapore lev us pasS to the Sandwich Islands, those gems of the Pacific. The arrival at the Sandwich Islands is always a welcome event in a cruise\u2014the delicious climate, the abundance of fruits, the romantic scenery, the gentle manners of the inhabitants, render this portion of the globe peculiarly attractive. Our sixth engraving represents a group of Sandwich Island girls dancing the hula-hula to the intense delight of a group of Jack tars, who probably experience as much satisfaction at the exhibition, as was ever experienced by the refined Parisians at the efforts of Taglioni, Cerito, or Fanny Ellsler. The hula-hula was formerly a favorite dance among the Sandwich Islands, but has now become nearly extinct through the influence of the missionaries. There are still, however, a few Kanakas, who are addicted to their old amusement. The dance does not admit of much grace, each female going through her gyrations with the mechanical stiffness of an automaton.  The next port we shall touch at, pleading the privilege of a roving commission, is Cape Town,  the capital of the Cape of Good Hope, the wellknown British colony at the Southern extremity of Africa. This point early attracted the attention of the Dutch, who saw that it was of the first importance as a watering-place for their ships. They accordingly established a colony there about the middle of the 17th century. They treated the native inhabitants, the Hottentots, with great severity, driving most of them beyond the mountains, and reducing the remainder to slavery. In 1795, it was captured by the English, but restored by the peace of Amiens, in 1802. In 1806, it was again captured by the English, and has remained in their possession since. It is defended by a castle of considerable strength, and contains many fine public buildings. The harbor is tolerably secure from September to May, during the prevalence of the southeast winds ; but during the rest of the year, when the winds blow from the north and northwest, vessels are obliged to resort to Fulse Bay, on the other side of the peninsula.  Our seventh engraving presents a sketch of a group of marketmen at Cape Town. We here see the native fish dealers and purchasers. A young negro in the foreground is feeding a pelican with a small fish which he has purloined from the bench. The principal market of Cape Town is not very attractive externally, but it is noted for the abundance and excellence of its fish, flesh and fowl, which supply the inhabitants and the ships touching at the port. The sales are conducted much after the manner of this country. The salesmen arc representatives of all quarters of the globe, and include specimens of the native Hottentot and the genuine Yankee, who is always found where money is to be made.  The eighth engraving is a view of the natives and their huts at St. Augustine's Bay, Madagascar. The inhabitants of this remarkably fertile island are composed of two distinct classes\u2014the Arabs, or descendants of foreign colonists, and the Negroes, or original inhabitants of the island. The character of the inhabitants differs much in the different parts of the island, and the accounts of writers vary greatly on this subject. The island is off the eastern coast of Africa, separated from the continent by the Mozambique channel, and is about 900 miles long and 200 broad. Its surface is greatly diversified, and its mountain scenery is exceedingly grand. The name and position of this island was first made known to Europeans by Marco Polo, in the 13th century, though the Arabs had been acquainted with it for several centuries. It was visited by the Portuguese in the beginning of the 16th century. The French made several attempts to found colonies there in the middle of the 17th century, but abandoned them after ineffectual struggles with the natives. In 1745, they renewed their efforts with but little better success. In 1814, it was claimed by England as a dependency of Mauritius, which had been ceded to her by France, and some settlements were established. One of the native kings of the interior, who had shown himself eager to procure a knowledge of European arts for his subjects, consented, in 1820, to relinquish the slave trade on condition that ten Madagassees should be sent to England, and ten to Mauritius, for education. Those sent to England were placed under the care of the}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n''Ballou's monthly magazine, Volume 8'' in 1858\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Macao.\n\n\"We arrived here on the twenty-second, and dispatched a boat to the shore immediately for letters. I received three or four of those fine large letters which are the envy of all who see them, and which are readily distinguishable by their size, and the beautiful style in which they are directed. You cannot imagine the delight with which I devoured their costents. I am glad you wrote so much of our dear pet. 0, my Dita, the longing I feel to take the dear little thing to my heart is agonising! Yesterday I was on shore, and saw a beautiful child of about the same age as ours. I was almost crazy at the sight. Twenty months old! How she must prattle by this time! I fancy I can see her trotting about, following you around the house. What a recompense for the hardest toil of the day would it not be to me, could I only lie down on the floor and have a good romp with her at night!\n\n\"And now for Macao, and what I saw, felt, and did. You probably know that a very numerous Chinese population lives entirely in boots; some of them so small that one pities the poor unfortunates who live so miserably. They are born, grow up, marry, and raise children in these boats. You would be astonished to see mothers, with infants at the breast, managing the sails, oars, and rudder of the boat as expertly as any sailor. The Tanka is of very light draft, and, being able to go close in shore, is used to land passengers from the larger boats. As we neared the shore, we noticed small boats pulling toward us from all directions. Soon a boat, \"manned\" by two really pretty young girls pulling oars, and a third sculling, came alongside, calling out earnestly, 'Takee me boat!' 'Takee me boat!' They had beautiful teeth, white as ivory, brilliant eyes, and their pretty faces, so earnest and pleading, were wreathed in smiles as we gave them the preference over others that joined us from all quarters, clinging to the sides of our large boat, and impeding our headway. The boatmen tried in vain to drive them off. One brute of a fellow splashed repeatedly a poor girl, who. though not at all pretty, had such a depth of meaning and such a sad expression in her eyes and face as charmed me completely. It would have interested any one to hear her scold back, and to see the flashing of her eyes, and the vivid expression in every feature. When I frowned at our sailor, the sudden change in her face from anger to smiles, the earnest 'takee me boat,' as she caught evidence of sympathy from me, was beautiful. We were assailed with these cries from so many, and there was such a clamour, that, in self-defense, we had to choose a boat and go. The first-mentioned girls, on account of their beauty, won the majority, and their boat was clean and well furnished, which is more than could be said of many of them. I caught the look of disappointment which passed over the features of the girl I have described, and it haunts me even now. Trifling as it, appeared to us, such scenes constitute the great events in their poor lives, and such triumphs or defeats are all-important to them.\n\n\"Upon entering the Tanka boat, we found the mother of the young girls, and a young infant dressed heroically. The infant was the child of the prettiest one of the girls, whose husband was away fishing. The old woman was quite talkative, and undoubtedly gave us lots of news!\n\n\"They had a miniature temple on the bows of the boat, with Joss seated cross-legged, looking very fat, and very red, and very stupid.

The theory that most of the Eurasian mixed race Hong Kong people are descended only from Tanka women and European men, and not ordinary Cantonese women, is backed up by other researchers who pointed out that Tanka women freely consorted with foreigners due to the fact that they were not bound by the same Confucian traditions as the Cantonese, and having a relationship with European men was advantageous for Tanka women. The ordinary Cantonese women did not sleep with European men, the Eurasian population was formed only from Tanka and European admixture.<ref>{{cite book |author=Meiqi Lee |title=Being Eurasian: memories across racial divides |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVGd71y1Y-0C&pg=PA262|year=2004 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |isbn=962-209-671-9 |page=262 |quote=EJ Eitel, in the late 1890s, claims that the 'half-caste population in Hong Kong ' were from the earliest days of the settlement almost exclusively the offspring of liaisons between European men and women of outcaste ethnic groups such as Tanka (Europe in China, 169). Lethbridge refutes the theory saying it was based on a 'myth' propagated by xenophobic Cantonese to account for the establishment of the Hong Kong Eurasian community. Carl Smith's study in the late 1960s on the protected women seems, to some degree, support Eitel's theory. Smith says that the Tankas experienced certain restrictions within the traditional Chinese social structure. Custom precluded their intermarriage with the Cantonese and Hakka-speaking populations. The Tanka women did not have bound feet. Their opportunities for settlement on shore were limited. They were hence not as closely tied to Confucian ethics as other Chinese ethnic groups. Being a group marginal to the traditional Chinese society of the Puntis (Cantonese), they did not have the same social pressure in dealing with Europeans (CT Smith, Chung Chi Bulletin, 27). 'Living under the protection of a foreigner,' says Smith, 'could be a ladder to financial security, if not respectability, for some of the Tanka boat girls' (13 ).}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Maria Jaschok |author2=Suzanne Miers |editor1=Maria Jaschok |editor2=Suzanne Miers |title=Women and Chinese patriarchy: submission, servitude, and escape |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f5o_t7VxHYAC&pg=PA223|year=1994 |publisher=Zed Books |isbn=1-85649-126-9 |page=223 |quote=He states that they had a near- monopoly of the trade in girls and women, and that: The half-caste population in Hong Kong were, from the earliest days of the settlement of the Colony and down to the present day, almost exclusively the offspring of these Tan-ka people.

Strange to say, when the settlement was first started, it was estimated that some 2,000 of these Tan-ka people had flocked to Hongkong, but at the present time they are about the same number, a tendency having set in among them to settle on shore rather than on the water and to disavow their Tan-ka extraction in order to mix on equal terms with the mass of the Chinese community. The half-caste population in Hongkong were, from the earliest days of the settlement of the Colony and down to the present day, almost exclusively the off-spring of these Tan-ka people. But, like the Tan-ka people themselves, they are happily under the influence of a process of continuous re-absorption in the mass of the Chinese residents of the Colony.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nDuring British rule some special schools were created for the Tanka.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hong Kong Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society |title=Journal, Volumes 18\u201321 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWU_AQAAIAAJ|year=1980 |page=121 |quote=How does it come about that this pleasing mixture of American Youth camp and English public-school sports day should come to represent\" the emotional high point of the year for these fifteen schools which cater for the Shui-sheung-yan (water-folk), traditionally the lowest of all Hong Kong's social strata.

The third engraving represents the dinner given on board the Powhatan, in honor of the commissioners appointed by the emperor to conduct negotiations. Commodore Perry invited the officers of the squadron to meet the Japanese officials, of whom there were about seventy. A very excellent dinner was served up, to which the guests did ample justice. Toasts to the emperor and president were drank with all the honors, and the company did not disperse until a very late hour.  Our next picture shows a Chinese tanka boat. The tanka boats are counted by thousands in the rivers and bays of China. They are often employed by our national vessels as conveyances to and. from the shore, thereby saving the health of the sailors, who would be otherwise subjected to pulling long distances under a hot sun, with a liability of contracting some fatal disease peculiar to China, and thus introducing infection in a crowded crew.  On her voyage, the Powhatan touched at Singapore, the capital of a small island at the southern extremity of Malacca. The town stands on a point of land near a bay, affording a safe anchorage at all seasons, and commanding the navigation of the Straits of Malacca. While the Powhatan lay at anchor here, the captain permitted two jugglers to come on board to gratify the wishes of the sailors, by exhibiting their skill in legerdemain, which art they profess in a wonderful degree of perfection. The feat of swallowing a sword was performed, as exhibited in our fifth engraving. But as the weapon belonged to the juggler, the men suspected it was prepared for the purpose, and that the blade consisted of running slides, which, by the pressure of the tongue to the point, would be forced into the hilt. The Malay, however, was determined to confound the doubters, and taking up a piece of rough cast iron from the armorer's forge, swallowed it with as much ease and facility as he did the sword. The performances ended with a lively dance executed by two cobras, to the accompaniment of harsh sounds from a trumpet played by an assistant.  From Singapore lev us pasS to the Sandwich Islands, those gems of the Pacific. The arrival at the Sandwich Islands is always a welcome event in a cruise\u2014the delicious climate, the abundance of fruits, the romantic scenery, the gentle manners of the inhabitants, render this portion of the globe peculiarly attractive. Our sixth engraving represents a group of Sandwich Island girls dancing the hula-hula to the intense delight of a group of Jack tars, who probably experience as much satisfaction at the exhibition, as was ever experienced by the refined Parisians at the efforts of Taglioni, Cerito, or Fanny Ellsler. The hula-hula was formerly a favorite dance among the Sandwich Islands, but has now become nearly extinct through the influence of the missionaries. There are still, however, a few Kanakas, who are addicted to their old amusement. The dance does not admit of much grace, each female going through her gyrations with the mechanical stiffness of an automaton.  The next port we shall touch at, pleading the privilege of a roving commission, is Cape Town,  the capital of the Cape of Good Hope, the wellknown British colony at the Southern extremity of Africa. This point early attracted the attention of the Dutch, who saw that it was of the first importance as a watering-place for their ships. They accordingly established a colony there about the middle of the 17th century. They treated the native inhabitants, the Hottentots, with great severity, driving most of them beyond the mountains, and reducing the remainder to slavery. In 1795, it was captured by the English, but restored by the peace of Amiens, in 1802. In 1806, it was again captured by the English, and has remained in their possession since. It is defended by a castle of considerable strength, and contains many fine public buildings. The harbor is tolerably secure from September to May, during the prevalence of the southeast winds ; but during the rest of the year, when the winds blow from the north and northwest, vessels are obliged to resort to Fulse Bay, on the other side of the peninsula.  Our seventh engraving presents a sketch of a group of marketmen at Cape Town. We here see the native fish dealers and purchasers. A young negro in the foreground is feeding a pelican with a small fish which he has purloined from the bench. The principal market of Cape Town is not very attractive externally, but it is noted for the abundance and excellence of its fish, flesh and fowl, which supply the inhabitants and the ships touching at the port. The sales are conducted much after the manner of this country. The salesmen arc representatives of all quarters of the globe, and include specimens of the native Hottentot and the genuine Yankee, who is always found where money is to be made.  The eighth engraving is a view of the natives and their huts at St. Augustine's Bay, Madagascar. The inhabitants of this remarkably fertile island are composed of two distinct classes\u2014the Arabs, or descendants of foreign colonists, and the Negroes, or original inhabitants of the island. The character of the inhabitants differs much in the different parts of the island, and the accounts of writers vary greatly on this subject. The island is off the eastern coast of Africa, separated from the continent by the Mozambique channel, and is about 900 miles long and 200 broad. Its surface is greatly diversified, and its mountain scenery is exceedingly grand. The name and position of this island was first made known to Europeans by Marco Polo, in the 13th century, though the Arabs had been acquainted with it for several centuries. It was visited by the Portuguese in the beginning of the 16th century. The French made several attempts to found colonies there in the middle of the 17th century, but abandoned them after ineffectual struggles with the natives. In 1745, they renewed their efforts with but little better success. In 1814, it was claimed by England as a dependency of Mauritius, which had been ceded to her by France, and some settlements were established. One of the native kings of the interior, who had shown himself eager to procure a knowledge of European arts for his subjects, consented, in 1820, to relinquish the slave trade on condition that ten Madagassees should be sent to England, and ten to Mauritius, for education. Those sent to England were placed under the care of the}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n''Ballou's monthly magazine, Volume 8'' in 1858\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Macao.\n\n\"We arrived here on the twenty-second, and dispatched a boat to the shore immediately for letters.

Windows 8.1 was made available as a free upgrade for retail copies of [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows RT]] users via the [[Windows Store]]. Windows 8.1's [[Windows server|server]] counterpart, [[Windows Server 2012 R2]], was released on the next day. Microsoft ended mainstream support for Windows 8.1 on January 9, 2018, but extended support will not end until January 10, 2023.\n\nWindows 8.1 aimed to address complaints of Windows 8 users and reviewers on launch.

Tom Warren of ''[[The Verge]]'' still considered the platform to be a \"work in progress\" due to the number of apps available, the impaired level of capabilities that apps have in comparison to desktop programs, and because he felt that mouse and keyboard navigation was still \"awkward\". However, he touted many of the major changes on Windows 8.1, such as the expanded snapping functionality, increased Start screen customization, SkyDrive and Bing integration, improvements to stock apps, and particularly he considered the Mail app to be \"lightyears ahead\" of the original version from 8. He concluded that \"Microsoft has achieved a lot within 12 months, even a lot of the additions feel like they should have been there from the very start with Windows 8.\"<ref name=verge-81review />\n\nJoel Hruska of ''[[ExtremeTech]]'' criticized continuing integration problems between the Desktop and apps on Windows 8.1, pointing out examples such as the Photos app, which \"still refuses to acknowledge that users might have previous photo directories\", and that the Mail app \"still can\u2019t talk to the desktop\u2014if you try to send an email from the Desktop without another mail client installed, Windows will tell you there\u2019s no mail client capable of performing that action.\" However, he praised the improvements to other apps, such as People and News (pointing out UI improvements, and the News app using proper links when sharing stories, rather than non-standard links that can only be recognized by the app). Although praising the more flexible snapping system, he still pointed out flaws, such as an inability to maintain snap configurations in certain situations. Windows 8.1's search functionality was met with mixed reviews; while noting the Bing integration and updated design, the system was panned for arbitrarily leaving out secondary storage devices from the \"Everything\" mode.<ref name=\"extremetech-81review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/168910-windows-8-1-and-the-desktop-a-modest-improvement-we-still-cant-recommend/ |title=Windows 8.1 and the Desktop: A modest improvement we still can\u2019t recommend |publisher=ExtremeTech |date=October 18, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPeter Bright of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' praised many of the improvements on Windows 8.1, such as its more \"complete\" touch interface, the \"reasonable\" tutorial content, the new [[autocomplete]] tools on the on-screen keyboard, software improvements, and the deep SkyDrive integration. However, he felt that the transition between the desktop and apps \"still tends to feel a bit disjointed and disconnected\" (even though the option to use the desktop wallpaper on the Start screen made it feel more integrated with the desktop interface rather than dissimilar), and that the restoration of the Start button made the two interfaces feel even more inconsistent because of how different it operates between the desktop and apps.<ref name=ars-81review>{{cite web |title=Windows 8.1: What a difference a year makes|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/windows-8-1-what-a-difference-a-year-makes/ |work=Ars Technica|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nCertain aspects of Windows 8.1 were also cause for concern because of their privacy implications. In his review of Windows 8.1, Joel Hruska noted that Microsoft had deliberately made it harder for users to create a \"Local\" account that is not tied to a [[Microsoft account]] for syncing, as it \"[makes] clear that the company really, really, wants you to share everything you do with it, and that\u2019s not something an increasing number of people and businesses are comfortable doing.\"<ref name=\"extremetech-81review\" />  Woody Leonhard of ''[[InfoWorld]]'' noted that by default Windows 8.1's \"Smart Search\" system sends search queries and other information to Microsoft, which could be used for [[targeted advertising]].

Tom Warren of ''[[The Verge]]'' still considered the platform to be a \"work in progress\" due to the number of apps available, the impaired level of capabilities that apps have in comparison to desktop programs, and because he felt that mouse and keyboard navigation was still \"awkward\". However, he touted many of the major changes on Windows 8.1, such as the expanded snapping functionality, increased Start screen customization, SkyDrive and Bing integration, improvements to stock apps, and particularly he considered the Mail app to be \"lightyears ahead\" of the original version from 8. He concluded that \"Microsoft has achieved a lot within 12 months, even a lot of the additions feel like they should have been there from the very start with Windows 8.\"<ref name=verge-81review />\n\nJoel Hruska of ''[[ExtremeTech]]'' criticized continuing integration problems between the Desktop and apps on Windows 8.1, pointing out examples such as the Photos app, which \"still refuses to acknowledge that users might have previous photo directories\", and that the Mail app \"still can\u2019t talk to the desktop\u2014if you try to send an email from the Desktop without another mail client installed, Windows will tell you there\u2019s no mail client capable of performing that action.\" However, he praised the improvements to other apps, such as People and News (pointing out UI improvements, and the News app using proper links when sharing stories, rather than non-standard links that can only be recognized by the app). Although praising the more flexible snapping system, he still pointed out flaws, such as an inability to maintain snap configurations in certain situations. Windows 8.1's search functionality was met with mixed reviews; while noting the Bing integration and updated design, the system was panned for arbitrarily leaving out secondary storage devices from the \"Everything\" mode.<ref name=\"extremetech-81review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/168910-windows-8-1-and-the-desktop-a-modest-improvement-we-still-cant-recommend/ |title=Windows 8.1 and the Desktop: A modest improvement we still can\u2019t recommend |publisher=ExtremeTech |date=October 18, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPeter Bright of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' praised many of the improvements on Windows 8.1, such as its more \"complete\" touch interface, the \"reasonable\" tutorial content, the new [[autocomplete]] tools on the on-screen keyboard, software improvements, and the deep SkyDrive integration. However, he felt that the transition between the desktop and apps \"still tends to feel a bit disjointed and disconnected\" (even though the option to use the desktop wallpaper on the Start screen made it feel more integrated with the desktop interface rather than dissimilar), and that the restoration of the Start button made the two interfaces feel even more inconsistent because of how different it operates between the desktop and apps.<ref name=ars-81review>{{cite web |title=Windows 8.1: What a difference a year makes|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/windows-8-1-what-a-difference-a-year-makes/ |work=Ars Technica|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nCertain aspects of Windows 8.1 were also cause for concern because of their privacy implications. In his review of Windows 8.1, Joel Hruska noted that Microsoft had deliberately made it harder for users to create a \"Local\" account that is not tied to a [[Microsoft account]] for syncing, as it \"[makes] clear that the company really, really, wants you to share everything you do with it, and that\u2019s not something an increasing number of people and businesses are comfortable doing.\"<ref name=\"extremetech-81review\" />  Woody Leonhard of ''[[InfoWorld]]'' noted that by default Windows 8.1's \"Smart Search\" system sends search queries and other information to Microsoft, which could be used for [[targeted advertising]].
