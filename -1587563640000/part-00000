Faizan is 'the good son' and wants to live up to his father's dream which is to run a business and improve the lifestyle of their family. Unfortunately the dreams are shattered while he was taking his exams as he is implicated  in a crime- a dispute with the 'booti mafia' (people facilitating cheating during exams), this results in his father's death and mother's mental health suffers due to shock of the tragic events, one following the other in quick succession.\n\nIn jail, he meets a man called Zaigham (Saud) and becomes friends with him who knows his enemies well and has his own issues to settle with them. Zaigham gets Faizan out of jail. Faizan now wants revenge for his parents. The rest is as predictable as any action movie made anywhere in the world - a journey towards retribution, passing through the maze called politics and crime.\n\n[[Zara Sheikh]], the girl Faizan loves, marries (Sami Khan) a police officer who is looking for Faizan since he is a criminal and Zara hides his picture when she sees it in Sami's wanted list so he won't know what he looks like. Meera and Faizan team up to kill Sajid Hassan who is the gang leader. Meera wants to kill him because he killed her sister by throwing acid on her face. Faizan finds his mother and, at the end, in a shootout Faizan finds out that Zara is married and Meera and Faizan are killed in a shootout.\n\n==Film's Reception==\n'''In city of Lahore:''' Golden Jubilee, 73 weeks (Gulistan Cinema 35, Capital Cinema 9, Plaza Cinema 9, Empire Cinema 8 weeks).

{"title_page": "Pony Express", "text_new": "{{short description|19th-century mail service in the US}}\n{{about|the quick delivery and mail service of 1860\u20131861|other meanings of \"Pony Express\"|Pony Express (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2015}}\n[[File:Pony Express Poster.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Pony Express advertisement]]\n[[File:Pony Express'60 West bound 1860.jpg|thumb|Pony Express Postmark, 1860, westbound]]\n\nThe '''Pony Express''' was a [[mail]] service delivering messages, newspapers, and mail using relays of horse-mounted riders that operated from April 3, 1860 to October 24, 1861 between [[Missouri]] and [[California]] in the [[United States of America]].\n\nOperated by [[Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company|Central Overland California and Pike's Peak Express Company]], the Pony Express was a great financial investment to the U.S. During its 18 months of operation, it reduced the time for messages to travel between the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coasts to about 10 days. Many people used the Pony Express as a communication link. It also encouraged catalogues to be created, allowing people to buy goods and have them brought by horse to the customers.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|pp=25\u201329}} It became the West's most direct means of east\u2013west communication before the [[First transcontinental telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] was established (October 24, 1861), and was vital for tying the new U.S. state of California with the rest of the [[United States]].\n\nDespite a heavy subsidy, the Pony Express was not a financial success and went bankrupt in eighteen months, when faster telegraph service was established.  Nevertheless, it demonstrated that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When replaced by the telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and became part of the lore of the [[American Old West|American West]]. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the [[Frontier Thesis|Frontier]] times.\n\n==Inception and founding==\n[[File:Alexander Majors Pony Express.jpg|thumb|upright|Alexander Majors]]\n\nThe idea of a fast mail route to the Pacific coast was prompted largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After [[California gold rush|gold was discovered there in 1848]], thousands of [[prospectors]], investors and businessmen made their way to California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p=9}} The demand for a faster way to get the mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the [[American Civil War]] approached.\n\n[[William Hepburn Russell|William Russell]], [[Alexander Majors]], and [[William B. Waddell (Pony Express founder)|William B. Waddell]] were the three founders of the Pony Express. They were already in the freighting and [[drayage]] business. At the peak of the operations, they employed 6,000 men, owned 75,000 oxen, thousands of wagons and warehouses, plus a sawmill, a meatpacking plant, a bank and an insurance company.{{sfn|Peters|1996|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nRussell was a prominent businessman, well respected among his peers and the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Hepburn-Russell|title=William Hepburn Russell {{!}} American businessman|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell & Co. After Morehead was bought out and retired, Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to Waddell & Russell. In 1855, they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors & Waddell.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=4\u20135}} They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. Government for fast mail delivery.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932|p=76}}\n\nBy utilizing a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional [[stagecoach]]es, they proposed to establish a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per {{convert|1/2|oz|g}}, then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, but that did not come about.\n\nRussell, Majors, and Waddell organized and put together the Pony Express in two months in the winter of 1860. The undertaking assembled 120 riders, 184 stations, 400 horses, and several hundred personnel during January and February 1861.<ref name=\"museum\">\n{{cite web\n|title=Pony Express National Museum\n|url=http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|publisher=City of St Joseph\n|accessdate=December 10, 2012\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312171306/http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|archivedate=March 12, 2013\n|df=mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nMajors was a religious man and resolved \"by the help of God\" to overcome all difficulties.

They often said that, if it came to be, the horse and rider should perish before the mochila did. The mochila was thrown over the saddle and held in place by the weight of the rider sitting on it. Each corner had a ''cantina,'' or pocket. Bundles of mail were placed in these cantinas, which were padlocked for safety. The mochila could hold {{convert|20|lb|0}} of mail along with the {{convert|20|lb|0}} of material carried on the horse.<ref>Riders were issued a Bible, a horn to alert employees at stations of their approach, a rifle, two Colt revolvers and ammunition for self-defense.

By 1860 there was a telegraph station in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], [[Nevada Territory]]. The riders received $100 a month as pay. A comparable wage for unskilled labor at the time was about $0.43\u2013$1 per day.\n\nAlexander Majors, one of the founders of the Pony Express, had acquired more than 400 horses for the project.

Reproduction of Jackson's map issued by the Union Pacific Railroad Company.</center>]]\n{{clear}}\nThe route started at [[St. Joseph, Missouri]] on the [[Missouri River]], it then followed what is modern-day [[U.S. Route 36|U.S. Highway 36]] (US&nbsp;36 the ''Pony Express Highway'') to Marysville, Kansas, where it turned northwest following [[Little Blue River (Kansas/Nebraska)|Little Blue River]] to [[Fort Kearny]] in Nebraska. Through Nebraska it followed the [[Great Platte River Road]], cutting through [[Gothenburg, Nebraska]], clipping the edge of Colorado at [[Julesburg, Colorado]], and passing [[Courthouse Rock]], [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]], and [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]], before arriving at [[Fort Laramie]] in Wyoming. From there it followed the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]], passing [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], [[Devil's Gate (Wyoming)|Devil's Gate]], and [[Split Rock (Wyoming)|Split Rock]], to [[Fort Caspar]], through [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] to [[Fort Bridger]] and then down to Salt Lake City. From Salt Lake City it generally followed the [[Central Nevada Route]] blazed by Captain [[James H. Simpson]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers#History|Corps of Topographical Engineers]] in 1859. This route roughly follows today's [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] across Nevada and Utah. It crossed the [[Great Basin]], the [[Central Nevada Route|Utah-Nevada Desert]], and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] near [[Lake Tahoe]] before arriving in [[Sacramento]]. Mail was then sent via steamer down the [[Sacramento River]] to [[San Francisco]]. On a few instances when the steamer was missed, riders took the mail via horseback to [[Oakland, California]].\n\n===Stations===\nThere were 190 stations along the long and arduous route used by the Pony Express. The stations and station keepers were essential to the successful, timely and smooth operation of the Pony Express mail system. The stations were often fashioned out of existing structures, several of them located in military forts, while others were built anew in remote areas where living conditions were very basic.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=113}} The route was divided up into five divisions.{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994}} To maintain the rigid schedule, 157 relay stations were located from {{convert|5|to|25|mi|0}} apart as the terrain would allow for. At each ''swing station,'' riders would exchange their tired mounts for fresh ones, while \"home stations\" provided room and board for the riders between runs. This technique allowed the mail to be whisked across the continent in record time. Each rider rode about {{convert|75|mi|sigfig=2}} per day.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}\n<!-- No contemporary linking, please.

It took place from May through June 1860, though sporadic violence continued for a period afterward.\nIn the brief history of the Pony Express, it only happened once that the mail did not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, the Pony Express was forced to suspend mail services because of the outbreak of the Paiute Indian War in May 1860.\n\nApproximately 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had suffered during a winter of fierce blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe was ready to embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named [[Numaga]]. For three days Numaga fasted and argued for peace.{{sfnp|Angel|1881|p=151}}\nMeanwhile, a raiding party attacked Williams Station, a Pony Express station located on the [[Carson River]] near present-day [[Lake Lahontan]]. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out when they went to investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.{{sfnp|Michno|2007|p=89-90}}\n\nDuring the following weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in the Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express was a special target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; 16 employees were killed, and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, not to mention the loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860,.{{sfnp|Frajola|Kramer|Walske|2005|p=18}}\n\nDuring this brief war, one Pony Express mailing, which left San Francisco on July 21, 1860, did not immediately reach its destination. That mail pouch (mochila) did not reach St. Joseph and subsequently New York until almost two years later.\n\n==Famous riders==\nIn 1860, riding for the Pony Express was difficult work&nbsp;\u2013 riders had to be tough and lightweight. A famous advertisement allegedly read:\n\n<blockquote>Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily.

In addition, there were also about 400 other employees, including station keepers, stock tenders and route superintendents. Many young men applied; Waddell and Majors could have easily hired riders at low rates, but instead offered one hundred dollars a month{{snd}}a handsome sum for that time.{{sfnp|Reinfeld|1973|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PSAOQ83qZ2cC&pg=PA49 49]}} Author [[Mark Twain]] described the riders in his travel memoir ''[[Roughing It]]'' as: \"...&nbsp;usually a little bit of a man\".

At the age of 15, Cody was on his way west to California when he met Pony Express agents along the way and signed on with the company. Cody helped in the construction of several way-stations. Thereafter, he was employed as a rider and was given a short {{convert|45|mi|adj=on}} delivery run from the township of Julesburg which lay to the west. After some months he was transferred to Slade's Division in Wyoming where he made the longest non-stop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. The distance of {{convert|322|mi}} over one of the most dangerous sections of the entire trail was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes, and 21 horses were required to complete this section.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}  On one occasion when carrying mail he unintentionally ran into an Indian war party but managed to escape.

Haslam was hired by Bolivar Roberts, helped build the stations, and was given the mail run from Friday's Station at Lake Tahoe to Buckland's Station near Fort Churchill, {{convert|75|mi}} to the east.\n\nHis greatest ride, {{convert|120|mi}} in 8 hours and 20 minutes while wounded, was an important contribution to the fastest trip ever made by the Pony Express. The mail carried Lincoln's inaugural address. Indian problems in 1860 led to Pony Bob Haslam's record-breaking ride. He had received the eastbound mail (probably the May 10 mail from San Francisco) at Friday's Station. When he reached Buckland's Station his relief rider was so badly frightened over the Indian threat that he refused to take the mail. Haslam agreed to take the mail all the way to Smith's Creek for a total distance of {{convert|190|mi}} without a rest. After a rest of nine hours, he retraced his route with the westbound mail where, at Cold Springs, he found that Indians had raided the place, killing the station keeper and running off all of the stock.

His business expanded as the town grew, and when the Pony Express came to town Landis was the ideal candidate to produce saddles for the newly founded Pony Express. Because Pony Express riders rode their horses at a quick pace over a distance of {{convert|10|mi}} or more between stations, every consideration was made to reduce the overall weight the horse had to carry. To help reduce this load, special lightweight [[saddle]]s were designed and crafted. Using less leather and fewer metallic and wood components, they fashioned a saddle that was similar in design to the regular stock saddle generally in use in the West at that time.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\nThe mail pouch was a separate component to the saddle that made the Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time-consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a ''mochila'' (a covering of leather) was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\n==Closing==\nDuring its brief time in operation, the Pony Express delivered approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California.<ref>{{ cite web |title=Replica of a Pony Express mochila |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=July 21, 2014 |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&cmd=1&id=17889&img=1&pg=1}}</ref> Although the Pony Express proved that the central/northern mail route was viable, [[Russell, Majors and Waddell]] did not get the contract to deliver mail over the route.

Until the 1950s most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express was the product of a few accounts, hearsay and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders and station keepers or who were interested in stations or Forts along the Pony Express route.\n\nThe most complete books on the Pony Express are ''The Story of the Pony Express'' and ''Saddles and Spurs'' by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as he was the first writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of the Pony Express amongst many historians.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01914.html |title=Russell, William Hepburn |encyclopedia=American National Biography |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Pony Express National Historic Trail}}\n[[File:Pony-express-statue.jpg|thumb|Pony Express statue in St. Joseph, Missouri]]\nFrom 1866 until 1889, the Pony Express logo was used by stagecoach and freight company [[Wells Fargo]], which provided secure mail service.

Many people used the Pony Express as a communication link. It also encouraged catalogues to be created, allowing people to buy goods and have them brought by horse to the customers.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|pp=25\u201329}} It became the West's most direct means of east\u2013west communication before the [[First transcontinental telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] was established (October 24, 1861), and was vital for tying the new U.S. state of California with the rest of the [[United States]].\n\nDespite a heavy subsidy, the Pony Express was not a financial success and went bankrupt in eighteen months, when faster telegraph service was established.  Nevertheless, it demonstrated that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When replaced by the telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and became part of the lore of the [[American Old West|American West]]. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the [[Frontier Thesis|Frontier]] times.\n\n==Inception and founding==\n[[File:Alexander Majors Pony Express.jpg|thumb|upright|Alexander Majors]]\n\nThe idea of a fast mail route to the Pacific coast was prompted largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After [[California gold rush|gold was discovered there in 1848]], thousands of [[prospectors]], investors and businessmen made their way to California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p=9}} The demand for a faster way to get the mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the [[American Civil War]] approached.\n\n[[William Hepburn Russell|William Russell]], [[Alexander Majors]], and [[William B. Waddell (Pony Express founder)|William B. Waddell]] were the three founders of the Pony Express. They were already in the freighting and [[drayage]] business. At the peak of the operations, they employed 6,000 men, owned 75,000 oxen, thousands of wagons and warehouses, plus a sawmill, a meatpacking plant, a bank and an insurance company.{{sfn|Peters|1996|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nRussell was a prominent businessman, well respected among his peers and the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Hepburn-Russell|title=William Hepburn Russell {{!}} American businessman|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell & Co. After Morehead was bought out and retired, Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to Waddell & Russell. In 1855, they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors & Waddell.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=4\u20135}} They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. Government for fast mail delivery.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932|p=76}}\n\nBy utilizing a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional [[stagecoach]]es, they proposed to establish a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per {{convert|1/2|oz|g}}, then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, but that did not come about.\n\nRussell, Majors, and Waddell organized and put together the Pony Express in two months in the winter of 1860. The undertaking assembled 120 riders, 184 stations, 400 horses, and several hundred personnel during January and February 1861.<ref name=\"museum\">\n{{cite web\n|title=Pony Express National Museum\n|url=http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|publisher=City of St Joseph\n|accessdate=December 10, 2012\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312171306/http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|archivedate=March 12, 2013\n|df=mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nMajors was a religious man and resolved \"by the help of God\" to overcome all difficulties.

They often said that, if it came to be, the horse and rider should perish before the mochila did. The mochila was thrown over the saddle and held in place by the weight of the rider sitting on it. Each corner had a ''cantina,'' or pocket. Bundles of mail were placed in these cantinas, which were padlocked for safety. The mochila could hold {{convert|20|lb|0}} of mail along with the {{convert|20|lb|0}} of material carried on the horse.<ref>Riders were issued a Bible, a horn to alert employees at stations of their approach, a rifle, two Colt revolvers and ammunition for self-defense.

Riders, who could not weigh over {{convert|125|lb}}, changed about every {{convert|75|\u2013|100|mi|sigfig=2}}, and rode day and night. In emergencies, a given rider might ride two stages back to back, over 20 hours on a quickly moving horse.\n\nIt is unknown if riders tried crossing the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in winter, but they certainly crossed central Nevada. By 1860 there was a telegraph station in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], [[Nevada Territory]]. The riders received $100 a month as pay. A comparable wage for unskilled labor at the time was about $0.43\u2013$1 per day.\n\nAlexander Majors, one of the founders of the Pony Express, had acquired more than 400 horses for the project.

Through Nebraska it followed the [[Great Platte River Road]], cutting through [[Gothenburg, Nebraska]], clipping the edge of Colorado at [[Julesburg, Colorado]], and passing [[Courthouse Rock]], [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]], and [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]], before arriving at [[Fort Laramie]] in Wyoming. From there it followed the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]], passing [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], [[Devil's Gate (Wyoming)|Devil's Gate]], and [[Split Rock (Wyoming)|Split Rock]], to [[Fort Caspar]], through [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] to [[Fort Bridger]] and then down to Salt Lake City. From Salt Lake City it generally followed the [[Central Nevada Route]] blazed by Captain [[James H. Simpson]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers#History|Corps of Topographical Engineers]] in 1859. This route roughly follows today's [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] across Nevada and Utah. It crossed the [[Great Basin]], the [[Central Nevada Route|Utah-Nevada Desert]], and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] near [[Lake Tahoe]] before arriving in [[Sacramento]]. Mail was then sent via steamer down the [[Sacramento River]] to [[San Francisco]]. On a few instances when the steamer was missed, riders took the mail via horseback to [[Oakland, California]].\n\n===Stations===\nThere were 190 stations along the long and arduous route used by the Pony Express. The stations and station keepers were essential to the successful, timely and smooth operation of the Pony Express mail system. The stations were often fashioned out of existing structures, several of them located in military forts, while others were built anew in remote areas where living conditions were very basic.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=113}} The route was divided up into five divisions.{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994}} To maintain the rigid schedule, 157 relay stations were located from {{convert|5|to|25|mi|0}} apart as the terrain would allow for. At each ''swing station,'' riders would exchange their tired mounts for fresh ones, while \"home stations\" provided room and board for the riders between runs.

Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed [[Fort Kearny]], Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an \"unrivaled feat at the time\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |title=Pony Express: ''Romance'' versus ''Reality'' \n |publisher=[[National Postal Museum]] \n |accessdate=December 10, 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021120155/https://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |archivedate=October 21, 2012 \n}}</ref>\n\n==Attacks==\n[[File:Pony Express Stolen Mail 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stolen Pony Express mail.

It took place from May through June 1860, though sporadic violence continued for a period afterward.\nIn the brief history of the Pony Express, it only happened once that the mail did not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, the Pony Express was forced to suspend mail services because of the outbreak of the Paiute Indian War in May 1860.\n\nApproximately 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had suffered during a winter of fierce blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe was ready to embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named [[Numaga]]. For three days Numaga fasted and argued for peace.{{sfnp|Angel|1881|p=151}}\nMeanwhile, a raiding party attacked Williams Station, a Pony Express station located on the [[Carson River]] near present-day [[Lake Lahontan]]. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out when they went to investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.{{sfnp|Michno|2007|p=89-90}}\n\nDuring the following weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in the Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express was a special target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; 16 employees were killed, and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, not to mention the loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860,.{{sfnp|Frajola|Kramer|Walske|2005|p=18}}\n\nDuring this brief war, one Pony Express mailing, which left San Francisco on July 21, 1860, did not immediately reach its destination. That mail pouch (mochila) did not reach St. Joseph and subsequently New York until almost two years later.\n\n==Famous riders==\nIn 1860, riding for the Pony Express was difficult work&nbsp;\u2013 riders had to be tough and lightweight. A famous advertisement allegedly read:\n\n<blockquote>Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred{{efn|One historian, Joseph Nardone, claims that the \"orphans preferred\" ad is a hoax (dating no earlier than 1902), as no one has found the ad in contemporary newspaper archives.{{sfnp|Thompson|2005}}}}</blockquote>\n\nThe Pony Express had an estimated 80 riders traveling east or west along the route at any given time.

At the age of 15, Cody was on his way west to California when he met Pony Express agents along the way and signed on with the company. Cody helped in the construction of several way-stations. Thereafter, he was employed as a rider and was given a short {{convert|45|mi|adj=on}} delivery run from the township of Julesburg which lay to the west. After some months he was transferred to Slade's Division in Wyoming where he made the longest non-stop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. The distance of {{convert|322|mi}} over one of the most dangerous sections of the entire trail was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes, and 21 horses were required to complete this section.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}  On one occasion when carrying mail he unintentionally ran into an Indian war party but managed to escape. Cody was present for many significant chapters in early western history, including the gold rush, the building of the railroads and cattle herding on the Great Plains.

Haslam was hired by Bolivar Roberts, helped build the stations, and was given the mail run from Friday's Station at Lake Tahoe to Buckland's Station near Fort Churchill, {{convert|75|mi}} to the east.\n\nHis greatest ride, {{convert|120|mi}} in 8 hours and 20 minutes while wounded, was an important contribution to the fastest trip ever made by the Pony Express. The mail carried Lincoln's inaugural address. Indian problems in 1860 led to Pony Bob Haslam's record-breaking ride. He had received the eastbound mail (probably the May 10 mail from San Francisco) at Friday's Station. When he reached Buckland's Station his relief rider was so badly frightened over the Indian threat that he refused to take the mail. Haslam agreed to take the mail all the way to Smith's Creek for a total distance of {{convert|190|mi}} without a rest. After a rest of nine hours, he retraced his route with the westbound mail where, at Cold Springs, he found that Indians had raided the place, killing the station keeper and running off all of the stock.

His business expanded as the town grew, and when the Pony Express came to town Landis was the ideal candidate to produce saddles for the newly founded Pony Express. Because Pony Express riders rode their horses at a quick pace over a distance of {{convert|10|mi}} or more between stations, every consideration was made to reduce the overall weight the horse had to carry. To help reduce this load, special lightweight [[saddle]]s were designed and crafted. Using less leather and fewer metallic and wood components, they fashioned a saddle that was similar in design to the regular stock saddle generally in use in the West at that time.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\nThe mail pouch was a separate component to the saddle that made the Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time-consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a ''mochila'' (a covering of leather) was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\n==Closing==\nDuring its brief time in operation, the Pony Express delivered approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California.<ref>{{ cite web |title=Replica of a Pony Express mochila |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=July 21, 2014 |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&cmd=1&id=17889&img=1&pg=1}}</ref> Although the Pony Express proved that the central/northern mail route was viable, [[Russell, Majors and Waddell]] did not get the contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to [[Jeremy Dehut]] in March 1861, who had taken over the southern Congressionally favored [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] Stage Line. The so-called 'Stagecoach King', [[Ben Holladay]], acquired the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.\n\nShortly after the contract was awarded, the start of the [[American Civil War]] caused the stage line to cease operation.

Until the 1950s most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express was the product of a few accounts, hearsay and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders and station keepers or who were interested in stations or Forts along the Pony Express route.\n\nThe most complete books on the Pony Express are ''The Story of the Pony Express'' and ''Saddles and Spurs'' by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as he was the first writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of the Pony Express amongst many historians.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01914.html |title=Russell, William Hepburn |encyclopedia=American National Biography |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Pony Express National Historic Trail}}\n[[File:Pony-express-statue.jpg|thumb|Pony Express statue in St. Joseph, Missouri]]\nFrom 1866 until 1889, the Pony Express logo was used by stagecoach and freight company [[Wells Fargo]], which provided secure mail service.
