This TV station, founded for the civilian population, was run by the Army Cinematographic Unit which until then had only produced propaganda films and newsreels and was responsible for entertaining the troops and other charity organizations with movie screenings. The personnel was composed mostly of soldiers, who already had experience in the film business in their civilian lives, as well as those who received their training in the army.\n\nThe setting, characters and situations portrayed in the film are largely autobiographical.

On the advice of Bauer, the Ambassador of the Holy See, Voiello decides a new pope must be elected to prevent Pius XIII from becoming a [[Idolatry|false idol]]. Realizing the [[papal conclave]] is unwilling to elect him, he and allies engage in tactical voting to prevent his opponent Cardinal Hern\u00e1ndez from being selected. They instead elect the mild-mannered Cardinal Viglietti, a devout follower of [[Francis of Assisi]], hoping to influence him by proxy. Adopting the name Pope Francis II, Viglietti quickly acclimates to his power and introduces radical charitable reforms to the church, such as allowing masses of [[European migrant crisis|refugees]] shelter in the Vatican, taking full control of the [[Vatican Archives]] and finances with the intent of giving them away, and compelling the [[College of Cardinals]] to surrender their valuables. The reforms, plus Viglietti\u2019s intent to [[defrock]] Voiello, cause the latter and Hern\u00e1ndez to plot to replace him with the more moderate Sir John Brannox, who was the third preference in the election. Pope Francis II suffers an apparent heart attack and dies, implied to have been orchestrated by Bauer. Pope Pius XIII, having been comatose for months, finally moves his finger. \n|LineColor = FF549F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 2\n|Title = Episode 2\n|DirectedBy = Paolo Sorrentino\n|WrittenBy = Paolo Sorrentino & Umberto Contarello & Stefano Bises\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|10|df=yes}}\n|Viewers = 0.17<ref name=\"ratings1-2\" /><br>0.43 {{small|({{abbr|o.n.|overnight}})}}<ref name=\"ratings1-2\" />\n|ShortSummary = \nVoiello, Assente, Guti\u00e9rrez, Aguirre and Sofia travel to [[England]] to meet with Brannox and convince him to accept the role of pope before the [[papal conclave]] votes. A member of British [[aristocracy]] and admirer of [[John Henry Newman]], Brannox is renowned in the church for the conversion of [[Anglicans]] to Catholicism and for a theological text, The Middle Way, published in his youth. The cardinals believe this centrist philosophy will restore order to the Vatican after the death of Francis II and the state of Pius XIII. Upon arrival at the Brannox estate, the group are shown to their bedrooms, where each of them (as well as Brannox) feels the presence of Pius XIII. In the Vatican, Sofia\u2019s husband Tomas meets with the [[Italian Minister of Economy and Finance]] and Cardinal Spalletta, who reveals he will be able to manipulate Brannox as he knows his one and only secret. The next morning, Voiello meets with Brannox, who reveals his elderly parents live in a separate wing so they never see him, believing him guilty for the death of his twin, Adam, whom they mourn daily. The group is taken aback by Brannox\u2019s eccentricity and candidness, but a later meal where the cardinal expands on his philosophy cements their decision to select him. Brannox informs them he will have a decision by morning. In the Vatican, a television broadcasts an anti-Christian message from an unknown Islamic [[caliphate]] before turning off. \n|LineColor = FF549F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber = 3\n|Title = Episode 3\n|DirectedBy = Paolo Sorrentino\n|WrittenBy = Paolo Sorrentino & Umberto Contarello & Stefano Bises\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|17|df=yes}}\n|Viewers = N/A\n|ShortSummary = Brannox discusses the possibility of being pope with Sofia and Guti\u00e9rrez. He later speaks to his parents, noting how ironic it is that their preferred long-gone son Adam could not become a prominent ecclesiastic figure, while he, the disgraced son, is now offered the highest position in the Church. He tells them he resents them for their contempt, and that he deserves to be pope because of that. Despite this, in the morning, he informs the others of his decision to decline the offer. However, Voiello manages to persuade him and they all return to Rome, where Brannox is elected Pope John Paul III and has his first homily. In financial hardship, Esther is introduced to Fabiano, a single man, and they begin a sexual relationship. Fabiano later informs Esther that a mother is paying good money for a woman to engage in sexual intercourse with her son Attanasio, who has physical deformities. Esther is initially irritated by the proposal, but she goes to see the son, only to run shortly after undressing. The Abbess and Sister Lisette ask Cavallo for money to allow Lisette to accompany her ill mother to Lourdes before she dies; Cavallo pretends to help them, but actually ignores their request. The pope addresses the cardinals, saying that tenderness has to be preferred over passion and that the Church has to learn how to love properly.

On the advice of Bauer, the Ambassador of the Holy See, Voiello decides a new pope must be elected to prevent Pius XIII from becoming a [[Idolatry|false idol]]. Realizing the [[papal conclave]] is unwilling to elect him, he and allies engage in tactical voting to prevent his opponent Cardinal Hern\u00e1ndez from being selected. They instead elect the mild-mannered Cardinal Viglietti, a devout follower of [[Francis of Assisi]], hoping to influence him by proxy. Adopting the name Pope Francis II, Viglietti quickly acclimates to his power and introduces radical charitable reforms to the church, such as allowing masses of [[European migrant crisis|refugees]] shelter in the Vatican, taking full control of the [[Vatican Archives]] and finances with the intent of giving them away, and compelling the [[College of Cardinals]] to surrender their valuables. The reforms, plus Viglietti\u2019s intent to [[defrock]] Voiello, cause the latter and Hern\u00e1ndez to plot to replace him with the more moderate Sir John Brannox, who was the third preference in the election. Pope Francis II suffers an apparent heart attack and dies, implied to have been orchestrated by Bauer.

A member of British [[aristocracy]] and admirer of [[John Henry Newman]], Brannox is renowned in the church for the conversion of [[Anglicans]] to Catholicism and for a theological text, The Middle Way, published in his youth. The cardinals believe this centrist philosophy will restore order to the Vatican after the death of Francis II and the state of Pius XIII. Upon arrival at the Brannox estate, the group are shown to their bedrooms, where each of them (as well as Brannox) feels the presence of Pius XIII. In the Vatican, Sofia\u2019s husband Tomas meets with the [[Italian Minister of Economy and Finance]] and Cardinal Spalletta, who reveals he will be able to manipulate Brannox as he knows his one and only secret. The next morning, Voiello meets with Brannox, who reveals his elderly parents live in a separate wing so they never see him, believing him guilty for the death of his twin, Adam, whom they mourn daily. The group is taken aback by Brannox\u2019s eccentricity and candidness, but a later meal where the cardinal expands on his philosophy cements their decision to select him.

He tells them he resents them for their contempt, and that he deserves to be pope because of that. Despite this, in the morning, he informs the others of his decision to decline the offer. However, Voiello manages to persuade him and they all return to Rome, where Brannox is elected Pope John Paul III and has his first homily. In financial hardship, Esther is introduced to Fabiano, a single man, and they begin a sexual relationship. Fabiano later informs Esther that a mother is paying good money for a woman to engage in sexual intercourse with her son Attanasio, who has physical deformities. Esther is initially irritated by the proposal, but she goes to see the son, only to run shortly after undressing. The Abbess and Sister Lisette ask Cavallo for money to allow Lisette to accompany her ill mother to Lourdes before she dies; Cavallo pretends to help them, but actually ignores their request. The pope addresses the cardinals, saying that tenderness has to be preferred over passion and that the Church has to learn how to love properly.

Voiello receives the Abbess and Sister Lisette, the leader of the strike, to hear them out, but advises them not to make an enemy of him; they later ask for a meeting with the Holy Father.

Spalletta then argues that due to his secretive [[Niccolo Machiavelli#Beliefs|Machiavellianism]], Voiello should be replaced as Secretary of State.

Multi-turreted, heavy and slow, they were not considered successful, which led to only five being produced. These were primarily used for propaganda purposes, though three took part in the [[Norwegian Campaign|Battle of Norway]] in 1940.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L04352, Deutschland, R\u00fcstungsproduktion, Panzer.jpg|thumb|left|Neubaufahrzeug while being repaired]]\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, a number of countries experimented with very large, multi-turreted tanks. The British built a single example of the [[Vickers A1E1 Independent]] in 1926. This inspired the Soviet [[T-35]], which was built in limited numbers from 1933.\n\nDevelopment of the ''Neubaufahrzeug'' started in 1933 when the then [[Reichswehr]] gave a contract for the development of a ''[[Gro\u00dftraktor]]'' (\"heavy tractor\") to both [[Rheinmetall]] and [[Krupp]]. ''Gro\u00dftraktor'' was a codename for the development of a heavy tank, Germany being still forbidden to develop tanks under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The technical details of the Vickers A1E1 Independent were then available to the Germans as they were amongst the information sold to them by a British officer, [[Norman Baillie-Stewart]], who acted as a German spy before his arrest in 1933. \n\nAlthough the Neubaufahrzeug came after the Gro\u00dftraktor, and they are not the same tank, the Rheinmetall and Krupp designs resembled each other to a large extent, the main difference being the weapons placement. Each had a main turret armed with a [[7.5 cm KwK 37|75&nbsp;mm KwK L/24]] main gun and secondary [[3.7 cm KwK 36|37&nbsp;mm KwK L/45]]. Rheinmetall's design mounted the second gun above the 75&nbsp;mm KwK L/24, while the Krupp design had it mounted next to the 75&nbsp;mm KwK L/24. Both designs had a secondary turret mounted to the front and the rear of the main turret. These turrets were slightly adapted [[Panzer I]] turrets, with the standard machine gun armament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/nazi_germany/neubaufahrzeug.php|title=Neubaufahrzeug|website=www.tanks-encyclopedia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref>\n\nRheinmetall's design was designated PzKpfw NbFz V (''PanzerKampfwagen NeubauFahrzeug V''), and the Krupp design PzKpfw NbFz VI. It was intended that these designs would fulfill the role of heavy tank in the armored forces, but the design proved to be too complex and unreliable for this role. Nevertheless, development continued in order for the nascent German military to gain experience with multi-turreted tanks.\n\nIn 1934 Rheinmetall built two [[Carbon steel#Mild and low-carbon steel|mild steel]] prototypes, both with their own turret design. Three more prototypes were built with proper armor and the Krupp turret in 1935 and 1936.\n\n==Combat history==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L03744, Norwegen, Oslo, Deutsche Panzer im Hafen.jpg|thumb|left|Three ''Neubaufahrzeuge'' arriving in Oslo Harbour, April 1940]]\nThough these tanks were never placed in production, they provided a propaganda tool for [[Nazism|Nazi]] Germany, for example being shown at the International Automobile Exposition in [[Berlin]] in 1939.\n\nThis propaganda role was extended with the German invasion of Norway, when ''[[Panzer-Abteilung 40|Panzer Abteilung z.b.V. 40]]'' (''zur besonderen Verwendung'' - \"for special purpose\") was formed for supporting the invasion of Norway, and the three Neubaufahrzeuge were assigned to that unit.\nOne vehicle was assigned to ''Kampfgruppe Fischer'' advancing north through the [[\u00d8sterdalen]] Valley, while the other two were assigned to ''Kampfgruppe Pellengahr'' advancing up the [[Gudbrand Valley]]. The one assigned to ''Kampfgruppe Fischer'' was immobilized with mechanical problems on its way to [[Lillehammer]], while one of the two assigned to Kampfgruppe Pellengahr also had mechanical problems just north of Lillehammer. Only one tank actually made it to the front; it was immediately put in action with the German force advancing up the Gudbrand Valley with other elements of ''Panzer Abteilung z.b.V. 40''.<ref>Nilsen. p. 10</ref>\n\nThe Neubaufahrzeuge first saw combat against British and Norwegian positions on April 22, near the small town of Balberg at the far south end of the Gudbrand Valley. The British Expeditionary Force was equipped with 0.55 inch calibre [[Boys anti-tank rifle|Boys Anti-tank rifles]] that easily penetrated the Neubaufahrzeug. After dozens of hits, including one that killed a crew member, the tank retreated and the crew was hesitant to advance further. Other German units pushed further through, flanking the British forces and forcing them to retreat.<ref>Hauge, page 302-305</ref>\n\nIt is unclear what happened to the tanks after the Norway campaign, but none of them survived the war. The surviving vehicles were ordered to be scrapped in 1941, and this took place in 1942 according to documents captured by the British in 1945. The dates when the vehicles were scrapped are unclear, but it is thought that the beginning of the construction of the ''[[Sturer Emil]]'' prototypes dates from the same time.\n\nAccording to contemporary German sources, three NbFz were attached to the [[1st Panzer Army]] and destroyed in battle with Soviet [[BT-7]] tanks in present-day [[Ukraine]] in June 1941.\n\nThe last known surviving Neubaufahrzeug was used by a Lehr instruction unit in late 1944 as a target for training the Volkssturm in the use of the Panzerschreck 43 and other anti-tank weapons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAll that survives of these tanks is a small number of [[running gear]] parts, preserved in the ''Gudbrandsdal Krigsminnesamling'' (Gudbrand Valley War Memorial collection), at [[Kvam, Oppland|Kvam]] in Norway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://the.shadock.free.fr/Surviving_Sonderfahrzeuge.pdf |title=Surviving German WW2 Sonderfahrzeuge |author= |date=22 October 2009 |work= |publisher=Surviving Panzers website |accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n;Citations\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* Chamberlain, Peter & Doyle, Hillary: ''Encyclopedia of German Tanks of World War Two: The Complete Illustrated Directory of German Battle Tanks, Armoured Cars, Self-propelled guns and Semi-tracked Vehicles 1939-1945'', Silverdale Books, 2004 {{ISBN|1-84509-012-8}}\n*Hauge, Andreas; Kampene i Norge 1940, Bind 1 (The Battles in Norway 1940, Volume 1).

Multi-turreted, heavy and slow, they were not considered successful, which led to only five being produced. These were primarily used for propaganda purposes, though three took part in the [[Norwegian Campaign|Battle of Norway]] in 1940.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L04352, Deutschland, R\u00fcstungsproduktion, Panzer.jpg|thumb|left|Neubaufahrzeug while being repaired]]\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, a number of countries experimented with very large, multi-turreted tanks. The British built a single example of the [[Vickers A1E1 Independent]] in 1926. This inspired the Soviet [[T-35]], which was built in limited numbers from 1933.\n\nDevelopment of the ''Neubaufahrzeug'' started in 1933 when the then [[Reichswehr]] gave a contract for the development of a ''Gro\u00dftraktor'' (\"heavy tractor\") to both [[Rheinmetall]] and [[Krupp]]. ''Gro\u00dftraktor'' was a codename for the development of a heavy tank, Germany being still forbidden to develop tanks under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The technical details of the Vickers A1E1 Independent were then available to the Germans as they were amongst the information sold to them by a British officer, [[Norman Baillie-Stewart]], who acted as a German spy before his arrest in 1933. \n\nAlthough the Neubaufahrzeug came after the Gro\u00dftraktor, and they are not the same tank, the Rheinmetall and Krupp designs resembled each other to a large extent, the main difference being the weapons placement. Each had a main turret armed with a [[7.5 cm KwK 37|75&nbsp;mm KwK L/24]] main gun and secondary [[3.7 cm KwK 36|37&nbsp;mm KwK L/45]]. Rheinmetall's design mounted the second gun above the 75&nbsp;mm KwK L/24, while the Krupp design had it mounted next to the 75&nbsp;mm KwK L/24. Both designs had a secondary turret mounted to the front and the rear of the main turret. These turrets were slightly adapted [[Panzer I]] turrets, with the standard machine gun armament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/nazi_germany/neubaufahrzeug.php|title=Neubaufahrzeug|website=www.tanks-encyclopedia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-05}}</ref>\n\nRheinmetall's design was designated PzKpfw NbFz V (''PanzerKampfwagen NeubauFahrzeug V''), and the Krupp design PzKpfw NbFz VI. It was intended that these designs would fulfill the role of heavy tank in the armored forces, but the design proved to be too complex and unreliable for this role. Nevertheless, development continued in order for the nascent German military to gain experience with multi-turreted tanks.\n\nIn 1934 Rheinmetall built two [[Carbon steel#Mild and low-carbon steel|mild steel]] prototypes, both with their own turret design. Three more prototypes were built with proper armor and the Krupp turret in 1935 and 1936.\n\n==Combat history==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L03744, Norwegen, Oslo, Deutsche Panzer im Hafen.jpg|thumb|left|Three ''Neubaufahrzeuge'' arriving in Oslo Harbour, April 1940]]\nThough these tanks were never placed in production, they provided a propaganda tool for [[Nazism|Nazi]] Germany, for example being shown at the International Automobile Exposition in [[Berlin]] in 1939.\n\nThis propaganda role was extended with the German invasion of Norway, when ''[[Panzer-Abteilung 40|Panzer Abteilung z.b.V. 40]]'' (''zur besonderen Verwendung'' - \"for special purpose\") was formed for supporting the invasion of Norway, and the three Neubaufahrzeuge were assigned to that unit.\nOne vehicle was assigned to ''Kampfgruppe Fischer'' advancing north through the [[\u00d8sterdalen]] Valley, while the other two were assigned to ''Kampfgruppe Pellengahr'' advancing up the [[Gudbrand Valley]]. The one assigned to ''Kampfgruppe Fischer'' was immobilized with mechanical problems on its way to [[Lillehammer]], while one of the two assigned to Kampfgruppe Pellengahr also had mechanical problems just north of Lillehammer. Only one tank actually made it to the front; it was immediately put in action with the German force advancing up the Gudbrand Valley with other elements of ''Panzer Abteilung z.b.V. 40''.<ref>Nilsen. p. 10</ref>\n\nThe Neubaufahrzeuge first saw combat against British and Norwegian positions on April 22, near the small town of Balberg at the far south end of the Gudbrand Valley. The British Expeditionary Force was equipped with 0.55 inch calibre [[Boys anti-tank rifle|Boys Anti-tank rifles]] that easily penetrated the Neubaufahrzeug. After dozens of hits, including one that killed a crew member, the tank retreated and the crew was hesitant to advance further. Other German units pushed further through, flanking the British forces and forcing them to retreat.<ref>Hauge, page 302-305</ref>\n\nIt is unclear what happened to the tanks after the Norway campaign, but none of them survived the war. The surviving vehicles were ordered to be scrapped in 1941, and this took place in 1942 according to documents captured by the British in 1945. The dates when the vehicles were scrapped are unclear, but it is thought that the beginning of the construction of the ''[[Sturer Emil]]'' prototypes dates from the same time.\n\nAccording to contemporary German sources, three NbFz were attached to the [[1st Panzer Army]] and destroyed in battle with Soviet [[BT-7]] tanks in present-day [[Ukraine]] in June 1941.\n\nThe last known surviving Neubaufahrzeug was used by a Lehr instruction unit in late 1944 as a target for training the Volkssturm in the use of the Panzerschreck 43 and other anti-tank weapons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAll that survives of these tanks is a small number of [[running gear]] parts, preserved in the ''Gudbrandsdal Krigsminnesamling'' (Gudbrand Valley War Memorial collection), at [[Kvam, Oppland|Kvam]] in Norway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://the.shadock.free.fr/Surviving_Sonderfahrzeuge.pdf |title=Surviving German WW2 Sonderfahrzeuge |author= |date=22 October 2009 |work= |publisher=Surviving Panzers website |accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n;Citations\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* Chamberlain, Peter & Doyle, Hillary: ''Encyclopedia of German Tanks of World War Two: The Complete Illustrated Directory of German Battle Tanks, Armoured Cars, Self-propelled guns and Semi-tracked Vehicles 1939-1945'', Silverdale Books, 2004 {{ISBN|1-84509-012-8}}\n*Hauge, Andreas; Kampene i Norge 1940, Bind 1 (The Battles in Norway 1940, Volume 1).
