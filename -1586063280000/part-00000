It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]]. The team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007), resulting in ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' being rushed for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006, for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month, and for [[Linux]] on [[April Fools]]. Versions for [[Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic 06 gameplay.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Screenshot of Wave Ocean, the first level of Sonic's campaign in Sonic the Hedgehog; this particular screen shows Sonic running at full speed while dodging obstacles.

Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Chef Pee Pee and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Chef Pee Pee stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris. Sonic and Elise are brought to the past and extinguish Solaris's flame, removing the god from existence and preventing the previous events from ever occurring.<ref>{{cite video game|quote='''Elise:''' This is where everything began.

It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]]. The team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007), resulting in ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' being rushed for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006, for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month, and for [[Linux]] on [[April Fools]]. Versions for [[Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic 06 gameplay.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Screenshot of Wave Ocean, the first level of Sonic's campaign in Sonic the Hedgehog; this particular screen shows Sonic running at full speed while dodging obstacles.

Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Chef Pee Pee and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Chef Pee Pee stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris.

Its crown is speckled dark grey on brown plumage. The juvenile bird has a characteristic yellow cheek sash, although this is less pronounced in the adult bird where predominantly the cheek is white with a grey and/or brown streak under the cheek.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Field guide to the birds of Australia|last=Simpson|first=K.|last2=Day|first2=N.|publisher=Penguin group Australian|year=2010|isbn=|edition=8th|location=Melbourne|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Birds of Australia: Photographic field guide|last=Flagg|first=Jim|publisher=Reed New Holland|year=2002|isbn=1 876334 78 9|location=Sydney|pages=294\u2013295}}</ref>\n\nIts beak is long and straight with a black tip and a fleshy red or pink colour towards the chin and up to the [[Beak|gape]]. The characteristic face pattern includes a long dark stripe through the eyes to the ear coverts. The breast is creamy-white with short browny streaks. The throat is often a light brown or cinnamon, sometimes extending from the beak to the upper breast. The wing feathers are a mottled dark olive-brown to grey with white edges. The tail has similar colouring but the tips of the tail feathers are white. The [[Covert feather|under-tail coverts]] are white or, on some birds, light grey often streaked.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThere seems to be an amount of variability in the appearance of many birds in this species. One example is on the [[Mornington Peninsula]] located on the eastern coast of Port Phillip Bay in Victoria where the birds have darker bellies. The juvenile birds of the species have a brown iris and the facial skin is paler on the beak.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Habitat ==\n\nThe spiny-cheeked honeyeater can be found in most locations throughout Australia, except east of the Great Dividing Range, Tasmania, the far south-west of Western Australia and the northern Australian tropics.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://bie.ala.org.au/search?q=Spiny-cheeked+Honeyeater|title=Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater {{!}} Search|last=Australia|first=Atlas of Living|website=bie.ala.org.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref> However, the birds do occur on [[Kangaroo Island]] in South Australia.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Acanthagenys-rufogularis|title=Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater {{!}} BIRDS in BACKYARDS|website=www.birdsinbackyards.net|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref>\n\nMost sightings have been in sparse, woody tree environments.

Its crown is speckled dark grey on brown plumage. The juvenile bird has a characteristic yellow cheek sash, although this is less pronounced in the adult bird where predominantly the cheek is white with a grey and/or brown streak under the cheek.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Field guide to the birds of Australia|last=Simpson|first=K.|last2=Day|first2=N.|publisher=Penguin group Australian|year=2010|isbn=|edition=8th|location=Melbourne|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Birds of Australia: Photographic field guide|last=Flagg|first=Jim|publisher=Reed New Holland|year=2002|isbn=1 876334 78 9|location=Sydney|pages=294\u2013295}}</ref>\n\nIts beak is long and straight with a black tip and a fleshy red or pink colour towards the chin and up to the [[Beak|gape]]. The characteristic face pattern includes a long dark stripe through the eyes to the ear coverts. The breast is creamy-white with short browny streaks. The throat is often a light brown or cinnamon, sometimes extending from the beak to the upper breast. The wing feathers are a mottled dark olive-brown to grey with white edges. The tail has similar colouring but the tips of the tail feathers are white. The [[Covert feather|under-tail coverts]] are white or, on some birds, light grey often streaked.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThere seems to be an amount of variability in the appearance of many birds in this species. One example is on the [[Mornington Peninsula]] located on the eastern coast of Port Phillip Bay in Victoria where the birds have darker bellies.
