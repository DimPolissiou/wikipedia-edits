It originally contained the farms of Woodruff, Conant and Saybrook. Local streets still bear their names.\n\nHillside was incorporated shortly after the appearance of [[Halley's Comet]] in 1910, and for that reason, the [[mascot|team nickname]] of [[Hillside High School (New Jersey)|Hillside High School]] is the \"Comets.\" Several local businesses take the name \"Comet\" for the same reason.\n\nThe Hillside Historical Society was established in the 1980s in the Woodruff home on Conant Street, perhaps the township's oldest.  The Woodruff House and Eaton Store Museum is operated and maintained by the Hillside Historical Society. Purchased by the Society in 1978, the house has been faithfully restored to its original grandeur. The Woodruff House spans three centuries in one structure, including the original 1735 building, the 1790 addition, the 1890s kitchen and the 1900s store.<ref>[http://www.woodruffhouse.org/overview.htm Historical Overview], Woodruff House and Eaton Store Museum.

The Woodruff House and Eaton Store Museum is operated and maintained by the Hillside Historical Society. Purchased by the Society in 1978, the house has been faithfully restored to its original grandeur.
