After middle school, Stiles began her high school career at [[Coe-Brown Northwood Academy]] in New Hampshire.\n\n==Career==\nAt the age of twelve, Stiles started getting involved with theater productions in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]. Her first role was when she played the titular character in ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' at the Seacoast Repertory Theater. As a teenager, Stiles played two other major roles while living in New Hampshire: [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', and [[Cinderella]] in ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''. Stiles loved the performing arts so much that she spent her summers working at the [[Prescott Park (New Hampshire)|Prescott Park]] Arts Festival in Portsmouth.\n\nBefore she got involved with Broadway productions, she trained at the [[American Musical and Dramatic Academy]] in New York City. Stiles is known for her two roles in the Off-Broadway production ''Avenue Q'', which is the story of a college student who moves to New York City with big dreams but lives on Avenue Q and has very little money. Stiles plays Kate Monster and Lucy the Slut, who are two [[puppet]]s that she controls throughout the show. \n\nAfter Stiles spent much of her time in the production of ''Avenue Q'', she later was offered the role of Joanne in ''Vanities'', a project that Stiles had been involved with for a period of two years. ''Vanities'' was located at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] in [[Pasadena, California]], but eventually was moved to [[Second Stage Theatre|Second Stage]] in New York. This role in ''Vanities'' eventually led Stiles to be involved in recording an album for the songs.\n\nShe played the role of [[Little Red Riding Hood]] in [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[James Lapine]]'s musical ''[[Into the Woods]]'' at the [[Delacorte Theater]] in New York as part of [[Shakespeare in the Park]]. She stars opposite [[Academy Award]] nominee [[Amy Adams]] and [[Tony Award]] winners [[Donna Murphy]] and [[Denis O'Hare]].\n\nIn 2017, Stiles appeared in the [[Epix]] television series ''[[Get Shorty (TV series)|Get Shorty]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/get-shorty-sarah-stiles-cast-epix-series-ray-romano-chris-odowd-1201850420/ |title=\u2018Get Shorty\u2019: Sarah Stiles Joins Cast Of Epix Series |last=Petski |first=Denise |date=November 7, 2016 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]  |access-date=May 16, 2017 }}</ref> Stiles appeared in the 2018 film ''[[Unsane (film)|Unsane]]''.\n\nShe appeared in the [[Tootsie (musical)|stage musical]] version of the film ''[[Tootsie]]'' beginning in September 2018, which premiered in Chicago at the Cadillac Palace Theatre from September 11 to October 14, 2018. The musical opened on Broadway in April 2019. In the third season of the Epix television series ''Get Shorty'' Stiles character Gladys, a singer/actress, is cast in the Broadway musical ''Tootsie'' playing the character Stiles actually played in the musical. This plot development allowed Stiles to recreate one of her numbers from the Broadway show on the TV series.\n\nIn 2019, Stiles voiced the character of Spinel, the main antagonist from the [[Cartoon Network]] television film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'', based on the series ''[[Steven Universe]]''. The performance received high praise from audiences and critics.\n\n==Discography==\nAlong with having performed on many different stages in various off-Broadway shows, Stiles has found the time to be involved in three different albums for three plays. Her first album recording was singing for the role of Joanne, for the musical, ''Vanities the Musical''. Her second album recording was when she sang the character Nazirah for the musical, ''The Road to Qatar''. Most recently, she can be heard on the album for the musical adaptation of Roald Dahl's ''James and the Giant Peach'' as the Spider. Aside from album recordings, Stiles and her friend Howie have been working on their sketches for their comedy channel on YouTube. The YouTube channel is called Sillyocity, and together, the two of them combine their ideas to make short comedic [[webisode]]s.\n\n==Theatre credits==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n!

After middle school, Stiles began her high school career at [[Coe-Brown Northwood Academy]] in New Hampshire.\n\n==Career==\nAt the age of twelve, Stiles started getting involved with theater productions in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]. Her first role was when she played the titular character in ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' at the Seacoast Repertory Theater. As a teenager, Stiles played two other major roles while living in New Hampshire: [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', and [[Cinderella]] in ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''. Stiles loved the performing arts so much that she spent her summers working at the [[Prescott Park (New Hampshire)|Prescott Park]] Arts Festival in Portsmouth.\n\nBefore she got involved with Broadway productions, she trained at the [[American Musical and Dramatic Academy]] in New York City. Stiles is known for her two roles in the Off-Broadway production ''Avenue Q'', which is the story of a college student who moves to New York City with big dreams but lives on Avenue Q and has very little money. Stiles plays Kate Monster and Lucy the Slut, who are two [[puppet]]s that she controls throughout the show. \n\nAfter Stiles spent much of her time in the production of ''Avenue Q'', she later was offered the role of Joanne in ''Vanities'', a project that Stiles had been involved with for a period of two years. ''Vanities'' was located at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] in [[Pasadena, California]], but eventually was moved to [[Second Stage Theatre|Second Stage]] in New York. This role in ''Vanities'' eventually led Stiles to be involved in recording an album for the songs.\n\nShe played the role of [[Little Red Riding Hood]] in [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[James Lapine]]'s musical ''[[Into the Woods]]'' at the [[Delacorte Theater]] in New York as part of [[Shakespeare in the Park]]. She stars opposite [[Academy Award]] nominee [[Amy Adams]] and [[Tony Award]] winners [[Donna Murphy]] and [[Denis O'Hare]].\n\nIn 2017, Stiles appeared in the [[Epix]] television series ''[[Get Shorty (TV series)|Get Shorty]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/get-shorty-sarah-stiles-cast-epix-series-ray-romano-chris-odowd-1201850420/ |title=\u2018Get Shorty\u2019: Sarah Stiles Joins Cast Of Epix Series |last=Petski |first=Denise |date=November 7, 2016 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]  |access-date=May 16, 2017 }}</ref> Stiles appeared in the 2018 film ''[[Unsane (film)|Unsane]]''.\n\nShe appeared in the [[Tootsie (musical)|stage musical]] version of the film ''[[Tootsie]]'' beginning in September 2018, which premiered in Chicago at the Cadillac Palace Theatre from September 11 to October 14, 2018. The musical opened on Broadway in April 2019. In the third season of the Epix television series ''Get Shorty'' Stiles character Gladys, a singer/actress, is cast in the Broadway musical ''Tootsie'' playing the character Stiles actually played in the musical. This plot development allowed Stiles to recreate one of her numbers from the Broadway show on the TV series.\n\nIn 2019, Stiles voiced the character of Spinel, the main antagonist from the [[Cartoon Network]] television film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'', based on the series ''[[Steven Universe]]''. The performance received high praise from audiences and critics.\n\n==Discography==\nAlong with having performed on many different stages in various off-Broadway shows, Stiles has found the time to be involved in three different albums for three plays. Her first album recording was singing for the role of Joanne, for the musical, ''Vanities the Musical''. Her second album recording was when she sang the character Nazirah for the musical, ''The Road to Qatar''. Most recently, she can be heard on the album for the musical adaptation of Roald Dahl's ''James and the Giant Peach'' as the Spider. Aside from album recordings, Stiles and her friend Howie have been working on their sketches for their comedy channel on YouTube. The YouTube channel is called Sillyocity, and together, the two of them combine their ideas to make short comedic [[webisode]]s.\n\n==Theatre credits==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n!

Throughout the generation, Sony and Microsoft continued to release hardware upgrades to their flagship consoles. In August 2016 and September 2016, Microsoft and Sony respectively both released \"slim\" revisions of their consoles, the Xbox One S and the PlayStation 4 Slim. The Xbox One S notably added support for [[HDR video]] and [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]], while Sony released a software update to add HDR to all existing PlayStation 4 consoles; the PlayStation 4 Slim does not support UHD Blu-ray. Following this was an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4, the [[PlayStation 4 Pro]], which was released later in November 2016; meanwhile, Microsoft also announced an upgraded version of the Xbox One in 2016 under the name ''Project Scorpio.'' This would become the [[Xbox One X]], released a year later in November 2017.

On August 28, 2013, Nintendo announced the production of the Basic model has ended and expected supplies to be exhausted by September 20, 2013.

The new console places a heavy emphasis on features surrounding social interaction; gameplay videos can be shared via the [[PlayStation Network]] and other services, and users can stream games being played by themselves or others (either through the console, or directly to services such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]]). The PS4's [[DualShock 4]] controller is similar to [[DualShock 3|the previous model]], but adds a [[touchpad]] and a \"Share\" button, along with an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] light bar on the front to allow motion tracking. An updated [[PlayStation Eye|camera accessory]] will also be offered for the system; it now uses 1280\u00d7800px [[stereo camera]]s with support for depth sensing similar to [[Kinect]], and remains compatible with the [[PlayStation Move]] peripherals. The PS4 will also have [[second screen]] capabilities through both [[mobile app]]s and the [[PlayStation Vita]], and [[Cloud gaming|game streaming]] through the recently acquired [[Gaikai]] service.<ref name=\"PS4 announced - TheVerge\">{{cite news | url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/20/4009410/sony-playstation-4-ps4-announcement | title=Sony announces the PlayStation 4 | work=The Verge | date=February 20, 2013 | accessdate=February 20, 2013 | last=Bishop | first=Bryan}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Conditt |first=Jessica |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/21/ps4-eye-has-two-cameras-one-to-watch-you-one-to-make-you-prett/ |title=PS4 Eye has two cameras: One to watch you, one to make you pretty |website=Joystiq |date=February 21, 2013 |accessdate=February 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/Fib3p |archive-date=May 30, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation 4 was released on November 15, 2013, in North America and November 29, 2013, in Australia and Europe at US$399.99, A$549 and \u20ac399 respectively.\n\n=== Xbox One ===\n{{Main|Xbox One}}\n\nOn May 21, 2013, Microsoft announced the Xbox One at an event in [[Redmond, Washington]]. The console has an increased focus on entertainment, including the ability to pass television programming from a [[set-top box]] over HDMI and use a built-in [[electronic program guide]], and the ability to [[Computer multitasking|multitask]] by snapping applications (such as [[Skype]] and [[Internet Explorer]]) to the side of the screen, similarly to [[Windows 8]]. The Xbox One features a new controller with \"Impulse Triggers\" that provide [[Haptic technology|force feedback]], and the ability to automatically [[Digital video recorder|record]] and save highlights from gameplay. An updated version of [[Kinect]] was developed for Xbox One, with a [[1080p]] camera and expanded voice controls. Originally bundled with the console, it has since been downplayed and excluded from later bundles.<ref name=\"verge-xbox1unveiling\">{{Cite web|title=Xbox One: a next-gen console with a focus on interactive TV and apps|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4350918/xbox-one-microsoft-unveils-its-next-generation-console|work=The Verge|accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"engadget-oneguide\">{{Cite web|title=Xbox One guide brings HDMI in/out, overlays for live TV|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/21/xbox-one-hdmi-passthrough/|work=Engadget|accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Xbox One was released in North America, Europe, and Australia on November 22, 2013, at a launch price of US$499.99, \u20ac499 and A$599 respectively with Japan, and was later released in 26 other markets in 2014. It had two mid-generation upgrades, one released in 2016 called the Xbox One S, and the other called the Xbox One X. The S was the cheaper option, but did not power 4K gaming like the X.\n\n=== Nintendo Switch ===\n{{Main|Nintendo Switch}}\n\nDue to the poor sales of the Wii U, along with competition from [[mobile gaming]], then-president [[Satoru Iwata]] sought to revitalize the company by creating a new strategy for Nintendo that included [[Nintendo mobile games|embracing mobile gaming]], and developing new hardware that would be attractive to a wider range of audiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/events/150508qa/02.html|title=Third Quarter Financial Results Briefing for Fiscal Year Ending March 2015|website=nintendo.co.jp|accessdate=November 14, 2019}}</ref> The hardware product was announced under the codename NX in a press conference held with [[DeNA]] on March 17, 2015,<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/17/nintendo-new-gaming-hardware-platform-codenamed-nx</ref> and fully revealed as the [[Nintendo Switch]] on October 20, 2016. The unit was released worldwide on March 3, 2017.\n\nThe Switch is considered by Nintendo a home console that has multiple ways to play. The main unit, the Console, is a tablet-sized device with a touch-sensitive screen. It can be inserted into a Docking Station which allows games to be played on a connected television. Alternatively, two [[Joy-Con]], motion-sensitive controllers comparable to the Wii Remotes, can be slotted onto the sides of the Console so the unit can be played as a handheld. Further, the Console can be set on a kickstand, allowing multiple players to see the screen and play games with separate Joy-Con. Additionally, Nintendo built the Switch on standard industry components, allowing for ease of porting games onto the system using standard software libraries and [[game engine]]s rather than Nintendo's proprietary approaches. This enabled them to bring several third-party and independent game developers on board prior to launch to assure a strong software library.\n\nThe Switch was met with critical praise and commercial success. Nintendo had anticipated selling about 10 million Switches in the first year of release but ended up exceeding this projection with total first-year sales of over 17 million units, exceeding the Wii U's lifetime sales. In late 2017, the Nintendo Switch was the fastest selling console in US history, and in November 2018 it was the fastest selling of all the 8th generation consoles in the US.<ref>[Nintendo Switch the fastest-selling US console this generation] Robert Purchese, Eurogamer, December 18, 2018</ref>\n\nA hardware revision, the Switch Lite, was announced for release in September 2019. The unit integrates the Joy-Con onto the main console with a smaller form-factor, making the unit strictly handheld rather than a hybrid system. Further details are described below under Handhelds.\n\n=== Comparison ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Comparison of eighth-generation video game home consoles\n\n<!-- Each console gets 11% width (12*8 = 96%), information column gets 4% (4% + 96% = 100%)  -->\n|-\n!

Designed as a less expensive version of the Switch, the Switch Lite integrates the Joy-Con onto the hardware unit itself, eliminating some of the Joy-Con's features, which prevents a small number of games in the Switch's library that exclusively require television or tabletop modes from being used on the Switch. Additionally, the Switch Lite cannot be docked. The unit is smaller and lighter than the main Switch console, and uses updated lower-powered hardware that improves its battery performance.

Throughout the generation, Sony and Microsoft continued to release hardware upgrades to their flagship consoles. In August 2016 and September 2016, Microsoft and Sony respectively both released \"slim\" revisions of their consoles, the Xbox One S and the PlayStation 4 Slim. The Xbox One S notably added support for [[HDR video]] and [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]], while Sony released a software update to add HDR to all existing PlayStation 4 consoles; the PlayStation 4 Slim does not support UHD Blu-ray. Following this was an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4, the [[PlayStation 4 Pro]], which was released later in November 2016; meanwhile, Microsoft also announced an upgraded version of the Xbox One in 2016 under the name ''Project Scorpio.'' This would become the [[Xbox One X]], released a year later in November 2017. Both of these consoles were aimed at providing upgraded hardware to support rendering games at up to [[4K resolution]].\n\nIn contrast to Microsoft and Sony, Nintendo began to phase out the Wii U in favor of a completely new hardware platform announced in April 2016 as ''NX''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Martens|first=Todd|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-nintendo-dates-its-successor-to-the-wii-u-the-nx-20160427-story.html|title=Nintendo dates its successor to the Wii U, the NX|date=April 27, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=April 8, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616200346/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-nintendo-dates-its-successor-to-the-wii-u-the-nx-20160427-story.html|archive-date=June 16, 2017|url-access=limited}}</ref> This would become the Nintendo Switch, released in March 2017.

Instead, each of the major manufacturers (Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo) produced new systems with similar designs and capabilities as their predecessors, but with increased performance (speed, graphics, storage capacity, etc.) Even the major innovation of the seventh generation, motion capture gaming, was greatly diminished in prevalence as most games opted to make it optional or secondary to traditional button-based controls. [[Virtual reality]] gaming hit the home console market in the middle of the generation with Sony releasing the [[PlayStation VR]], a [[virtual reality headset]] compatible with all PlayStation 4, in October 2016. Sales remained modest, with only 4% of PS4 owners purchasing one.

This financially hurt Nintendo, with several financial quarters running at a loss through 2014. Nintendo had anticipated the Wii U would sell similarly to the Wii. Nintendo officially discontinued the Wii U on January 31, 2017, about a month before the release of the Nintendo Switch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2017/1/31/14452066/wii-u-discontinued|title=Final Wii U models discontinued in Japan - Polygon|website=www.polygon.com|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== PlayStation 4 ===\n{{Main|PlayStation 4}}\n\nOn February 20, 2013, Sony announced the PlayStation 4 during a press conference in [[New York City]], and it was released on November 15, 2013, in North America. The new console places a heavy emphasis on features surrounding social interaction; gameplay videos can be shared via the [[PlayStation Network]] and other services, and users can stream games being played by themselves or others (either through the console, or directly to services such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]]). The PS4's [[DualShock 4]] controller is similar to [[DualShock 3|the previous model]], but adds a [[touchpad]] and a \"Share\" button, along with an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] light bar on the front to allow motion tracking. An updated [[PlayStation Eye|camera accessory]] will also be offered for the system; it now uses 1280\u00d7800px [[stereo camera]]s with support for depth sensing similar to [[Kinect]], and remains compatible with the [[PlayStation Move]] peripherals. The PS4 will also have [[second screen]] capabilities through both [[mobile app]]s and the [[PlayStation Vita]], and [[Cloud gaming|game streaming]] through the recently acquired [[Gaikai]] service.<ref name=\"PS4 announced - TheVerge\">{{cite news | url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/20/4009410/sony-playstation-4-ps4-announcement | title=Sony announces the PlayStation 4 | work=The Verge | date=February 20, 2013 | accessdate=February 20, 2013 | last=Bishop | first=Bryan}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Conditt |first=Jessica |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/21/ps4-eye-has-two-cameras-one-to-watch-you-one-to-make-you-prett/ |title=PS4 Eye has two cameras: One to watch you, one to make you pretty |website=Joystiq |date=February 21, 2013 |accessdate=February 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/Fib3p |archive-date=May 30, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation 4 was released on November 15, 2013, in North America and November 29, 2013, in Australia and Europe at US$399.99, A$549 and \u20ac399 respectively.\n\n=== Xbox One ===\n{{Main|Xbox One}}\n\nOn May 21, 2013, Microsoft announced the Xbox One at an event in [[Redmond, Washington]]. The console has an increased focus on entertainment, including the ability to pass television programming from a [[set-top box]] over HDMI and use a built-in [[electronic program guide]], and the ability to [[Computer multitasking|multitask]] by snapping applications (such as [[Skype]] and [[Internet Explorer]]) to the side of the screen, similarly to [[Windows 8]]. The Xbox One features a new controller with \"Impulse Triggers\" that provide [[Haptic technology|force feedback]], and the ability to automatically [[Digital video recorder|record]] and save highlights from gameplay. An updated version of [[Kinect]] was developed for Xbox One, with a [[1080p]] camera and expanded voice controls. Originally bundled with the console, it has since been downplayed and excluded from later bundles.<ref name=\"verge-xbox1unveiling\">{{Cite web|title=Xbox One: a next-gen console with a focus on interactive TV and apps|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4350918/xbox-one-microsoft-unveils-its-next-generation-console|work=The Verge|accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"engadget-oneguide\">{{Cite web|title=Xbox One guide brings HDMI in/out, overlays for live TV|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/21/xbox-one-hdmi-passthrough/|work=Engadget|accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Xbox One was released in North America, Europe, and Australia on November 22, 2013, at a launch price of US$499.99, \u20ac499 and A$599 respectively with Japan, and was later released in 26 other markets in 2014. It had two mid-generation upgrades, one released in 2016 called the Xbox One S, and the other called the Xbox One X. The S was the cheaper option, but did not power 4K gaming like the X.\n\n=== Nintendo Switch ===\n{{Main|Nintendo Switch}}\n\nDue to the poor sales of the Wii U, along with competition from [[mobile gaming]], then-president [[Satoru Iwata]] sought to revitalize the company by creating a new strategy for Nintendo that included [[Nintendo mobile games|embracing mobile gaming]], and developing new hardware that would be attractive to a wider range of audiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/events/150508qa/02.html|title=Third Quarter Financial Results Briefing for Fiscal Year Ending March 2015|website=nintendo.co.jp|accessdate=November 14, 2019}}</ref> The hardware product was announced under the codename NX in a press conference held with [[DeNA]] on March 17, 2015,<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/17/nintendo-new-gaming-hardware-platform-codenamed-nx</ref> and fully revealed as the [[Nintendo Switch]] on October 20, 2016. The unit was released worldwide on March 3, 2017.\n\nThe Switch is considered by Nintendo a home console that has multiple ways to play. The main unit, the Console, is a tablet-sized device with a touch-sensitive screen. It can be inserted into a Docking Station which allows games to be played on a connected television. Alternatively, two [[Joy-Con]], motion-sensitive controllers comparable to the Wii Remotes, can be slotted onto the sides of the Console so the unit can be played as a handheld. Further, the Console can be set on a kickstand, allowing multiple players to see the screen and play games with separate Joy-Con. Additionally, Nintendo built the Switch on standard industry components, allowing for ease of porting games onto the system using standard software libraries and [[game engine]]s rather than Nintendo's proprietary approaches. This enabled them to bring several third-party and independent game developers on board prior to launch to assure a strong software library.\n\nThe Switch was met with critical praise and commercial success. Nintendo had anticipated selling about 10 million Switches in the first year of release but ended up exceeding this projection with total first-year sales of over 17 million units, exceeding the Wii U's lifetime sales. In late 2017, the Nintendo Switch was the fastest selling console in US history, and in November 2018 it was the fastest selling of all the 8th generation consoles in the US.<ref>[Nintendo Switch the fastest-selling US console this generation] Robert Purchese, Eurogamer, December 18, 2018</ref>\n\nA hardware revision, the Switch Lite, was announced for release in September 2019. The unit integrates the Joy-Con onto the main console with a smaller form-factor, making the unit strictly handheld rather than a hybrid system. Further details are described below under Handhelds.\n\n=== Comparison ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Comparison of eighth-generation video game home consoles\n\n<!-- Each console gets 11% width (12*8 = 96%), information column gets 4% (4% + 96% = 100%)  -->\n|-\n!

Designed as a less expensive version of the Switch, the Switch Lite integrates the Joy-Con onto the hardware unit itself, eliminating some of the Joy-Con's features, which prevents a small number of games in the Switch's library that exclusively require television or tabletop modes from being used on the Switch. Additionally, the Switch Lite cannot be docked. The unit is smaller and lighter than the main Switch console, and uses updated lower-powered hardware that improves its battery performance. It otherwise supports all other features of the Switch, including its communication capabilities.\n\n=== Handheld comparison ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Ryan Clements from ''[[IGN]]'' has praised the game's skill and battle system, calling it \"unlike any JRPG I've played in recent memory. Even more surprising are the game's boss encounters, which require extreme focus to beat.\" He also noted that the music is \"very enjoyable\" and that, while the story is simple, the sincerity \"keeps it from being boring\". Still, he criticized the need to backtrack to the dungeons and the \"modest\" graphics.<ref name=\"IGNYs7review\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.psp.ign.com/articles/111/1114820p1.html|title=Ys Seven Review|last=Clements|first=Ryan|date=2010-08-20|website=IGN|archiveurl=http://uk.psp.ign.com/articles/111/1114820p1.html|archivedate=2010-08-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nRPGamer awarded Ys Seven \"Best PSP RPG of 2010\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/awards/2010/results/psp.html|title=RPGamer Awards 2010 best PSP RPG|author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line given -->|website=RPGamer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130221841/http://www.rpgamer.com/awards/2010/results/psp.html|archivedate=2011-01-30|url-status=live|accessdate=2015-12-16}}</ref>\n\nRPGFan named it \"Overall Best RPG of E3\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/features/e3-2010/awards/index2.html|title=RPGFan E3 2010 Awards & Gallery|author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line given -->|website=RPGFan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707071031/http://www.rpgfan.com/features/e3-2010/awards/index2.html|archivedate=2010-07-07|url-status=live|accessdate=2015-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://www.worldofys.com/ys7/}}\n\n{{Ys series}}\n\n[[Category:2009 video games]]\n[[Category:Action role-playing video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Portable games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Ys (series)]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=January 2010}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Ys Seven\n| image = Ys Seven Cover.jpg\n| developer = [[Nihon Falcom]]\n| publisher = {{vgrelease|JP|[[Nihon Falcom]]|CHN|Wangyuan Shengtang<ref>http://ys7.wangyuan.com/</ref>|WW|[[XSEED Games]]}}\n| director = Toshihiro Kondo\n| producer = [[Masayuki Kato]]\n| designer = \n| programmer = Hideyuki Yamashita\n| artist = Katsumi Enami <small>([[Illustration]])</small>\n| writer = {{Unbulleted list|Hisayoshi Takeiri|Syunsei Shikata|Yuuta Miyazaki|Toru Endo|Aichiro Miyata}}\n| composer = {{Unbulleted list|Hayato Sonoda |Takahiro Unisuga |Saki Momiyama |Masanori Osaki}}\n| series = ''[[Ys (series)|Ys]]''\n| platforms = [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Microsoft Windows]]\n| released = '''PlayStation Portable'''{{vgrelease|JP|September 17, 2009|NA|August 17, 2010|EU|November 3, 2010|AUS|February 20, 2013}}'''Microsoft Windows'''{{vgrelease|CHN|July 2012<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://ys7.wangyuan.com/2012/07/27/000017.shtml |script-title=zh:\u300a\u4f0a\u82cf\u300b\u7cfb\u5217\u6e38\u620f\u4ecb\u7ecd | language = zh-hans| access-date = June 10, 2018}}</ref>|WW|August 30, 2017}}\n| genre = [[Action role-playing game|Action role-playing]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Ys Seven'''''|\u30a4\u30fc\u30b97}} is an [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] video game developed by [[Nihon Falcom]] and the seventh installment in the [[Ys (series)|''Ys'' video game series]].

Attempting to parry with the wrong timing will result in the player taking a critical hit.\n\n==Music==\nSoundtrack releases for ''Ys SEVEN'' include:\n*''Ys VII: Original Sound Track'' (2009): The complete soundtrack to ''Ys VII''.\n*''Ys SEVEN Musical Selections'' (2010): A compilation of 27 songs from the game, released by [[Xseed Games]] with the Limited Edition version of the North American release.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = PSP: 79/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/psp/ys-seven |title=Ys Seven for PSP Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2016-12-02}}</ref><br />PC: 80/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/ys-seven |title=Ys Seven for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n| IGN = PSP: 8 of 10<ref name=\"IGNYs7review\"/>\n}}\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews. Ryan Clements from ''[[IGN]]'' has praised the game's skill and battle system, calling it \"unlike any JRPG I've played in recent memory. Even more surprising are the game's boss encounters, which require extreme focus to beat.\" He also noted that the music is \"very enjoyable\" and that, while the story is simple, the sincerity \"keeps it from being boring\". Still, he criticized the need to backtrack to the dungeons and the \"modest\" graphics.<ref name=\"IGNYs7review\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.psp.ign.com/articles/111/1114820p1.html|title=Ys Seven Review|last=Clements|first=Ryan|date=2010-08-20|website=IGN|archiveurl=http://uk.psp.ign.com/articles/111/1114820p1.html|archivedate=2010-08-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nRPGamer awarded Ys Seven \"Best PSP RPG of 2010\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/awards/2010/results/psp.html|title=RPGamer Awards 2010 best PSP RPG|author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line given -->|website=RPGamer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130221841/http://www.rpgamer.com/awards/2010/results/psp.html|archivedate=2011-01-30|url-status=live|accessdate=2015-12-16}}</ref>\n\nRPGFan named it \"Overall Best RPG of E3\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/features/e3-2010/awards/index2.html|title=RPGFan E3 2010 Awards & Gallery|author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line given -->|website=RPGFan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707071031/http://www.rpgfan.com/features/e3-2010/awards/index2.html|archivedate=2010-07-07|url-status=live|accessdate=2015-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website\n| http://www.worldofys.com/ys7/ }}\n\n{{Ys series}}\n\n[[Category:2009 video games]]\n[[Category:Action role-playing video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Portable games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Ys (series)]]\n", "name_user": "LightKeyDarkBlade", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys_Seven"}
