In 1610, the Dominican priest Francisco Blancas de San Jose published the \"Arte y reglas de la lengua tagala\" (which was subsequently revised with two editions in 1752 and 1832) in Bataan. In 1613, the Franciscan priest Pedro de San Buenaventura published the first Tagalog dictionary, his \"Vocabulario de la lengua tagala\" in Pila, Laguna.\n\nThe first substantial dictionary of the Tagalog language was written by the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Pablo Clain]] in the beginning of the 18th century. Clain spoke Tagalog and used it actively in several of his books.

In addition, Tagalog is used as a [[second language]] throughout the country.]]\n\nAt present, no comprehensive [[dialectology]] has been done in the Tagalog-speaking regions, though there have been descriptions in the form of dictionaries and grammars of various Tagalog dialects. [[Ethnologue]] lists Manila, Lubang, [[Marinduque]], Bataan (Western Central Luzon), [[Batangas Tagalog|Batangas]], Bulacan (Eastern Central Luzon), Tanay-Paete (Rizal-Laguna), and Tayabas (Quezon) as dialects of Tagalog; however, there appear to be four main dialects, of which the aforementioned are a part: Northern (exemplified by the [[Bulacan]] dialect), Central (including Manila), Southern (exemplified by Batangas), and Marinduque.\n\nSome example of dialectal differences are:\n* Many Tagalog dialects, particularly those in the south, preserve the glottal stop found after consonants and before vowels. This has been lost in Standard Tagalog. For example, standard Tagalog ''ngay\u00f3n'' (now, today), ''sinig\u00e1ng'' (broth stew), ''gab\u00ed'' (night), ''matam\u00eds'' (sweet), are pronounced and written ''ngay-on'', ''sinig-ang'', ''gab-i'', and ''matam-is'' in other dialects.\n* In [[Teresa, Rizal|Teresian]]-[[Morong, Rizal|Morong]] Tagalog, {{IPA|[\u027e]}} is usually preferred over {{IPA|[d]}}. For example, ''bund\u00f3k'', ''dagat'', ''dingd\u00edng'', and ''isd\u00e2'' become ''bunr\u00f3k'', ''ragat'', ''ringr\u00edng'', and ''isr\u00e2'', e.g. \"sand\u00f3k sa dingd\u00edng\" becoming \"sanr\u00f3k sa ringr\u00edng\".\n* In many [[Batangas Tagalog|southern dialects]], the progressive aspect infix of ''-um-'' verbs is ''na-''. For example, standard Tagalog ''kumakain'' (eating) is ''n\u00e1k\u00e1in'' in Quezon and Batangas Tagalog. This is the butt of some jokes by other Tagalog speakers, for should a Southern Tagalog ask ''n\u00e1k\u00e1in ka ba ng pat\u00edng?'' (\"Do you eat shark?\"), he would be understood as saying \"Has a shark eaten you?\" by speakers of the Manila Dialect.\n* Some dialects have interjections which are considered a regional trademark. For example, the interjection ''ala e!'' usually identifies someone from Batangas as does ''hane?!'' in Rizal and Quezon provinces.\n\nPerhaps the most divergent Tagalog dialects are those spoken in Marinduque.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Soberano |first=Ros| year=2015 |title=The dialects of Marinduque Tagalog |series=Pacific Linguistics - Series B No. 69 |location=Canberra |publisher=Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University |doi=10.15144/PL-B69}}</ref> Linguist Rosa Soberano identifies two dialects, western and eastern, with the former being closer to the Tagalog dialects spoken in the provinces of Batangas and Quezon.\n\nOne example is the verb conjugation paradigms. While some of the affixes are different, Marinduque also preserves the imperative affixes, also found in Visayan and Bikol languages, that have mostly disappeared from most Tagalog early 20th century; they have since merged with the infinitive.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Filipino language|Manila Tagalog]]\n! scope=\"col\" | Marinduque\u00f1o Tagalog\n! scope=\"col\" | English\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Susulat sin\u00e1 Mar\u00eda at Esperanza kay Juan.\n| M\u00e1s\u00falat da Mar\u00eda at Esperanza kay Juan.\n| \"Mar\u00eda and Esperanza will write to Juan.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mag-aaral siya sa Maynil\u00e0.\n| Gaaral siya sa Maynil\u00e0.\n| \"[He/She] will study in Manila.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Maglut\u00f2 ka na.\n| Paglut\u00f2.\n| \"Cook now.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Kainin mo iy\u00e1n.\n| Kaina yaan.\n| \"Eat it.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tinatawag tayo ni Tatay.\n| Inatawag ngan\u00ec kit\u00e1 ni Tatay.\n| \"Father is calling us.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\u00fatulungan ba kay\u00f3 ni Hilario?\n| Atulungan ga kamo ni Hilario?\n| \"Is Hilario going to help you?\"\n|}\n\nNorthern and central dialects form the basis for the national language.\n\n===Accents===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Tagalog language also boasts [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accentations]] unique to some parts of [[Tagalog people|Tagalog-speaking regions]]. For example, in some parts of [[Manila]], a strong pronunciation of ''i'' exists and vowel-switching of ''o'' and ''u'' exists so words like \"gising\" (to wake) is pronounced as \"giseng\" with a strong 'e' and the word \"tagu-taguan\" (hide-and-go-seek) is pronounced as \"tago-tagoan\" with a mild 'o'.\n\n[[Batangas Tagalog]] boasts the most distinctive accent in Tagalog compared to the more Hispanized northern accents of the language.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The [[Batangas]] accent has been featured in film and television and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] actor [[Leo Martinez]] speaks with this accent. Martinez's accent, however, will quickly be recognized by native Batangue\u00f1os as representative of the accent in western Batangas which is milder compared to that used in the eastern part of the province.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nBulacan Tagalog has more [[Linguistic conservatism|deep words]] and accented like Filipino during the Spanish period.\n\nQuezon and Aurora's Tagalog has unique accents. Quezon's Tagalog has also has several unique words, and each town has a different tone, like in [[Sariaya]], [[Atimonan]] and [[Gumaca]].\n\nCavite accent specifically in the lowland part of the province were a mix of deep Tagalog and Chavacano, a language also spoken in Zamboanga while in upland Cavite like in the municipalities of [[Alfonso, Cavite]], [[Magallanes, Cavite]] as well as [[Tagaytay City]] uses the accent comparable to the accent used in western Batangas due to its proximity.\n\nLaguna also has a different set of accents, notably in the municipality of [[Alaminos, Laguna]] and the City of [[San Pablo, Laguna]] has the accent comparable to the accent used in eastern Batangas while the accent used in the northern parts of Laguna such as [[Bi\u00f1an, Laguna]] and [[San Pedro, Laguna]] uses the accent comparable to Manila Tagalog.\n\nNueva Ecija's accent is like Bulacan's, but with different intonations. Tarlac also has this accent.\n\n===Code-switching with English===\n{{main|Taglish}}\n\n''Taglish'' and ''Englog'' are names given to a mix of English and Tagalog. The amount of English vs. Tagalog varies from the occasional use of English loan words to changing language in mid-sentence. Such code-switching is prevalent throughout the Philippines and in various languages of the Philippines other than Tagalog.\n\nCode-mixing also entails the use of foreign words that are \"Filipinized\" by reforming them using Filipino rules, such as verb conjugations. Users typically use Filipino or English words, whichever comes to mind first or whichever is easier to use.\n\n{{Verse translation\n| Magshoshopping kami sa mall. Sino ba ang magdadrive sa shopping center?\n| We will go shopping at the mall. Who will drive to the shopping center?\n}}\n\nCity-dwellers are more likely to do this.\n\nThe practice is common in television, radio, and print media as well. Advertisements from companies like [[Wells Fargo]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[New Albertsons|Albertsons]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Western Union]] have contained Taglish.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Tagalog phonology}}\n{{IPA notice}}\nTagalog has 33 [[phoneme]]s: 19 of them are [[consonant]]s and 14 are [[vowel]]s.

Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1521 and the beginning of their colonization in 1565, Tagalog was written in an [[abugida]]\u2014or [[alphasyllabary]]\u2014called [[Baybayin]]. This system of writing gradually gave way to the use and propagation of the Latin alphabet as introduced by the Spanish. As the Spanish began to record and create grammars and dictionaries for the various languages of the Philippine archipelago, they adopted systems of writing closely following the orthographic customs of the Spanish language and were refined over the years. Until the first half of the 20th century, most Philippine languages were widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a number of educated Filipinos began proposing for revising the spelling system used for Tagalog at the time. In 1884, Filipino doctor and student of languages [[Trinidad Pardo de Tavera]] published his study on the ancient Tagalog script ''Contribucion para el Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos'' and in 1887, published his essay ''El Sanscrito en la lengua Tagalog'' which made use of a new writing system developed by him. Meanwhile, Jose Rizal, inspired by Pardo de Tavera's 1884 work, also began developing a new system of orthography (unaware at first of Pardo de Tavera's own orthography).<ref name=\"Is k foreign 19\"/> A major noticeable change in these proposed orthographies was the use of the letter \u27e8k\u27e9 rather than \u27e8c\u27e9 and \u27e8q\u27e9 to represent the phoneme {{IPA|/k/}}.\n\nIn 1889, the new bilingual Spanish-Tagalog ''La Espa\u00f1a Oriental'' newspaper, of which [[Isabelo de los Reyes]] was an editor, began publishing using the new orthography stating in a footnote that it would \"use the orthography recently introduced by ... learned Orientalis\". This new orthography, while having its supporters, was also not initially accepted by several writers. Soon after the first issue of ''La Espa\u00f1a'', [[Pascual H. Poblete]]'s ''Revista Cat\u00f3lica de Filipina'' began a series of articles attacking the new orthography and its proponents. A fellow writer, Pablo Tecson was also critical. Among the attacks was the use of the letters \"k\" and \"w\" as they were deemed to be of German origin and thus its proponents were deemed as \"unpatriotic\". The publishers of these two papers would eventually merge as ''La Lectura Popular'' in January 1890 and would eventually make use of both spelling systems in its articles.<ref name=\"k is for\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Megan C.|title=K is for De-Kolonization: Anti-Colonial Nationalism and Orthographic Reform|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=8 October 2007|volume=49|issue=4|pages=938\u2013967|doi=10.1017/S0010417507000813}}</ref><ref name=\"Is k foreign 19\">{{cite web|title=Accusations of Foreign-ness of the Revista Cat\u00f3lica de Filipinas - Is 'K' a Foreign Agent?

In it, he addressed the criticisms of the new writing system by writers like Pobrete and Tecson and the simplicity, in his opinion, of the new orthography. Rizal described the orthography promoted by Pardo de Tavera as \"more perfect\" than what he himself had developed.<ref name=\"k is for\"/> The new orthography was however not broadly adopted initially and was used inconsistently in the bilingual periodicals of Manila until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"k is for\"/> The revolutionary society Kata\u00e1s-taasan, Kagalang-galang Katipunan ng\u0303 mg\u0303\u00e1 Anak ng\u0303 Bayan or [[Katipunan]] made use of the k-orthography and the letter k featured prominently on many of its flags and insignias.<ref name=\"k is for\"/>\n\nIn 1937, Tagalog was selected to serve as basis for the country's [[national language]]. In 1940, the ''Balar\u00edl\u00e0 ng Wikang Pambans\u00e2'' ({{lang-en|Grammar of the National Language}}) of grammarian [[Lope K. Santos]] introduced the [[Abakada script|Abakada]] alphabet. This alphabet consists of 20 letters and became the standard alphabet of the national language.<ref name=\"ebolusyon\">{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Ebolusyon ng Alpabetong Filipino | url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Kasaysayan | accessdate = 2010-06-22}}</ref> The orthography as used by Tagalog would eventually influence and spread to the systems of writing used by other Philippine languages (which had been using variants of the Spanish-based system of writing). In 1987, the ABAKADA was dropped and in its place is the expanded Filipino alphabet.\n\n===Baybayin===\n{{Main|Baybayin}}\n\nTagalog was written in an [[abugida]] ([[alphasyllabary]]) called [[Baybayin]] prior to the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, in the 16th century. This particular [[writing system]] was composed of symbols representing three [[vowel]]s and 14 [[consonant]]s. Belonging to the [[Brahmic family]] of scripts, it shares similarities with the [[Old Kawi]] script of [[Javanese language|Java]] and is believed to be descended from the script used by the [[Bugis]] in [[Sulawesi]].\n\nAlthough it enjoyed a relatively high level of literacy, Baybayin gradually fell into disuse in favor of the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] taught by the Spaniards during their rule.\n\nThere has been confusion of how to use Baybayin, which is actually an [[abugida]], or an [[alphasyllabary]], rather than an [[alphabet]]. Not every letter in the Latin alphabet is represented with one of those in the Baybayin alphasyllabary. Rather than letters being put together to make sounds as in Western languages, Baybayin uses symbols to represent syllables.\n\nA \"kudlit\" resembling an apostrophe is used above or below a symbol to change the vowel sound after its consonant. If the kudlit is used above, the vowel is an \"E\" or \"I\" sound. If the kudlit is used below, the vowel is an \"O\" or \"U\" sound. A special kudlit was later added by Spanish missionaries in which a cross placed below the symbol to get rid of the vowel sound all together, leaving a consonant. Previously, the consonant without a following vowel was simply left out (for example, ''bundok'' being rendered as ''budo''), forcing the reader to use context when reading such words.\n\nExample:\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em 0;\">[[File:Baybayin sample 02.jpg|Ba Be Bo B (in Baybayin)]]</div>\n\nBaybayin is encoded in Unicode version 3.2 in the range 1700-171F under the name \"Tagalog\".\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em 0;\">\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin A.svg|center|\u1700]] a || [[File:Baybayin E-I.svg|center|\u1701]] e/i || [[File:Baybayin O-U.svg|center|\u1702]] o/u\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ka.svg|center|\u1703]] ka || [[File:Baybayin Ga.svg|center|\u1704]] ga || [[File:Baybayin Nga.svg|center|\u1705]] nga\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ta.svg|center|\u1706]] ta || [[File:Baybayin Da.svg|center|\u1707]] da/ra || [[File:Baybayin Na.svg|center|\u1708]] na\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Pa.svg|center|\u1709]] pa || [[File:Baybayin Ba.svg|center|\u170a]] ba || [[File:Baybayin Ma.svg|center|\u170b]] ma\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ya.svg|center|\u170c]] ya || [[File:Baybayin La.svg|center|\u170e]] la || [[File:Baybayin Wa.svg|center|\u170f]] wa || [[File:Baybayin Sa.svg|center|\u1710]] sa || [[File:Baybayin Ha.svg|center|\u1711]] ha\n|}\n</div>\n\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ vowels\n!

(Those are my clothe'''s''')) are abbreviations that are pronounced ''nang'' {{IPA|[na\u014b]}} and ''mang\u00e1'' {{IPA|[m\u0250\u02c8\u014ba]}}. ''Ng'', in most cases, roughly translates to \"of\" (ex. ''Siya ay kapatid '''ng''' nanay ko.'' She is the sibling ''of'' my mother) while ''nang'' usually means \"when\" or can describe how something is done or to what extent (equivalent to the suffix ''-ly'' in English adverbs), among other uses. \n* '''''Nang''' si Hudas ay nadul\u00e1s.''\u2014When [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] slipped.\n* ''Gumising siya '''nang''' <u>maaga</u>.''\u2014He woke up <u>early</u>.\n* ''Gumal\u00edng '''nang''' <u>{{sic|hide=y|todo}}</u> si Juan dahil nag-ensayo siya.''\u2014Juan <u>greatly</u> improved because he practiced.\n\nIn the first example, ''nang'' is used in lieu of the word ''noong'' (when; ''<u>Noong</u> si Hudas ay madulas''). In the second, ''nang'' describes that the person woke up (''gumising'') early (''maaga''); ''gumising nang maaga''. In the third, ''nang'' described up to what extent that Juan improved (''gumaling''), which is \"greatly\" (''nang {{sic|hide=y|todo}}''). In the latter two examples, the ligature ''na'' and its variants ''-ng'' and ''-g'' may also be used (''Gumising <u>na</u> maaga/Maaga<u>ng</u> gumising''; ''Gumaling <u>na</u> {{sic|hide=y|todo}}/Todo<u>ng</u> gumaling'').\n\nThe longer ''nang'' may also have other uses, such as a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] that joins a repeated word:\n*''Naghint\u00e1y sila '''nang''' naghint\u00e1y.''\u2014They kept on waiting\" (a closer calque: \"They were waiting and waiting.\")\n\n===''p\u00f4/h\u00f4'' and ''op\u00f2/oh\u00f2''===\nThe words ''p\u00f4/h\u00f4'' and ''op\u00f2/oh\u00f2'' are traditionally used as polite iterations of the affirmative \"''oo''\" (\"yes\"). It is generally used when addressing elders or superiors such as bosses or teachers.\n\n\"P\u00f4\" and \"op\u00f2\" are specifically used to denote a high level of respect when addressing older persons of close affinity like parents, relatives, teachers and family friends. \"H\u00f4\" and \"oh\u00f2\" are generally used to politely address older neighbours, strangers, public officials, bosses and nannies, and may suggest a distance in societal relationship and respect determined by the addressee's social rank and not their age. However, \"p\u00f4\" and \"op\u00f2\" can be used in any case in order to express an elevation of respect.\n*Example: \"''Pakitapon naman '''p\u00f4/ho''' yung basura.''\" (\"Please throw away the trash.\")\n\nUsed in the affirmative:\n*Ex: \"''Gut\u00f3m ka na ba?\" \"'''Op\u00f2/Oh\u00f2'''''\". (\"Are you hungry yet?\" \"Yes.\")\n\n''P\u00f4/H\u00f4'' may also be used in negation.\n*Ex: \"''Hindi ko '''p\u00f4/h\u00f4''' alam 'yan.''\" (\"I don't know that.\")\n\n==Vocabulary and borrowed words==\n{{see also|List of loanwords in Tagalog}}\n\nTagalog vocabulary is composed mostly of words of native Austronesian origin - most of the words that end with the [[diphthongs]] -iw, (e.g. saliw) and those words that exhibit [[reduplication]] (e.g. halo-halo, patpat, etc.). However it has a significant number of Spanish loanwords. Spanish is the language that has bequeathed the most loanwords to Tagalog.\n\nIn pre-Hispanic times, [[Malay trade and creole languages|Trade Malay]] was widely known and spoken throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].\n\nTagalog also includes many loanwords from English, [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]), [[Chinese language]]s ([[Hokkien]], [[Cantonese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].\n\nDue to trade with Mexico via the [[Manila galleon]]s from the 16th to the 19th centuries, many words from [[Nahuatl]] (Aztec) and Castilian (Spanish) were introduced to Tagalog.\n\nThe Philippines has long been a melting pot of nations. The islands have been subject to different influences and a meeting point of numerous migrations since the early prehistoric origins of trading activities, especially from the time of the Neolithic Period, the [[Silk Road]], the [[Tang Dynasty]], the [[Ming Dynasty]], the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]], the [[Spice Route]] and the [[Manila Galleon]] trading periods. This means that the evolution of the language is difficult to reconstruct (although many theories exist).\n\nEnglish has borrowed some words from Tagalog, such as abaca, barong, [[butterfly knife|balisong]], [[boondocks]], [[jeepney]], Manila hemp, [[pancit]], ylang-ylang, and yaya, although the vast majority of these borrowed words are only used in the Philippines as part of the vocabularies of [[Philippine English]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Other examples of Tagalog words used in English\n! scope=\"col \" | Example\n! scope=\"col \" | Definition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[boondocks]]\n| meaning \"rural\" or \"back country,\" was imported by American soldiers stationed in the Philippines following the Spanish\u2013American War as a mispronounced version of the Tagalog ''bundok'', which means \"mountain.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | cogon\n| a type of grass, used for thatching.

The first Bible in Tagalog, then called ''Ang Biblia''<ref>Worth, Roland H. ''Biblical Studies On The Internet: A Resource Guide'', 2008 (p. 43)</ref> (\"the Bible\") and now called ''Ang Dating Biblia''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adb.scripturetext.com/genesis/1.htm |title=Genesis 1 Tagalog: Ang Dating Biblia (1905) |publisher=Adb.scripturetext.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> (\"the Old Bible\"), was published in 1905. In 1970, the [[Philippine Bible Society]] translated the [[Bible]] into modern Tagalog. Even before the [[Second Vatican Council]], devotional materials in Tagalog had been in circulation. There are at least four circulating Tagalog translations of the Bible\n* the ''[[Magandang Balita Biblia]]'' (a parallel translation of the ''[[Good News Bible]]''), which is the [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] version\n* the [[Bibliya ng Sambayanang Pilipino]]\n* the 1905 ''Ang Biblia'' is a more Protestant version\n* the ''Bagong Sanlibutang Salin ng Banal na Kasulatan'' (''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'')\n\nWhen the [[Second Vatican Council]], (specifically the [[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]) permitted the universal prayers to be translated into [[Vernacular|vernacular languages]], the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] was one of the first to translate the [[Roman Missal]] into Tagalog. The [[Roman Missal]] in Tagalog was published as early as 1982.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses were printing Tagalog literature at least as early as 1941<ref>{{cite book|title=2003 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|page=155|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> and ''[[The Watchtower]]'' (the primary magazine of Jehovah's Witnesses) has been published in Tagalog since at least the 1950s. New releases are now regularly released simultaneously in a number of languages, including Tagalog. The official website of Jehovah's Witnesses also has some publications available online in Tagalog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wol.jw.org/tl/wol/h/r27/lp-tg|title=Watchtower Online Library (Tagalog)|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> The revised [[bible]] edition, the ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,'' was released in Tagalog on 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jw.org/en/whats-new/nwt-tagalog/#?insight[search_id]=bafc855e-cdb8-464c-9c65-a909a69e59a3&insight[search_result_index]=6|title=New World Translation Released in Tagalog|last=|first=|date=January 21, 2019|website=Jw.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and it is distributed without charge both printed and [https://www.jw.org/tl/library/bibliya/nwt/mga-aklat/ online versions].\n\nTagalog is quite a stable language, and very few revisions have been made to Catholic [[Bible translations]]. Also, as Protestantism in the Philippines is relatively young, [[liturgy|liturgical]] prayers tend to be more [[ecumenism|ecumenical]].\n\n==Examples==\n===Lord's Prayer===\nIn Tagalog, the [[Lord's Prayer]] is exclusively known by its [[incipit]], ''Am\u00e1 Namin'' (literally, \"Our Father\").\n\n{{Poemquote\n| style=font-style:italic; line-height:2.1em;\n| text=\nAm\u00e1 namin, sumasalangit Ka,\nSambah\u00edn ang ngalan Mo.\nMapasaamin ang kahari\u00e1n Mo.\nSund\u00edn ang lo\u00f3b Mo,\nDito sa lup\u00e0, gaya nang sa langit.\nBigy\u00e1n Mo kam\u00ed ngay\u00f3n ng aming kakanin sa araw-araw,\nAt patawarin Mo kam\u00ed sa aming mga sal\u00e2,\nPara nang pagp\u00e1patawad namin,\nSa nagkakasal\u00e0 sa amin;\nAt huw\u00e1g Mo kam\u00edng ipahintulot sa tuks\u00f3,\nAt iady\u00e2 Mo kam\u00ed sa lah\u00e1t ng masam\u00e2.\n[Sapagk\u00e1t sa Iny\u00f3 ang kahari\u00e1n, at ang kapangyarihan,\nAt ang kaluw\u00e1lhatian, ngay\u00f3n, at magpakailanman.]\nAmen.\n}}\n\n===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===\nThis is Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (''P\u00e1ngkalahat\u00e1ng Pagpapahayag ng Karapat\u00e1ng Pantao'')\n\n{{Verse translation\n| lang=tl\n| Bawat tao'y isinilang na may lay\u00e0 at magkakapant\u00e1y ang tagl\u00e1y na dang\u00e1l at karapat\u00e1n.

The first set consists of native Tagalog words and the other set are Spanish loanwords. (This may be compared to other East Asian languages, except with the second set of numbers borrowed from Spanish instead of Chinese.) For example, when a person refers to the number \"seven\", it can be translated into Tagalog as \"''pito''\" or \"''siyete''\" (Spanish: ''siete'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Number\n! scope=\"col\" | Cardinal\n! scope=\"col\" | Spanish loanword<br />(Original Spanish)\n! scope=\"col\" | Ordinal\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 0\n| sero / wal\u00e2 (lit. \"null\") / aw\u00e1n\n| sero (cero)\n| -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1\n| is\u00e1\n| uno (uno)\n| una\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2\n| dalaw\u00e1 [dalaua]\n| dos (dos)\n| pangalaw\u00e1 / ikalaw\u00e1 (informally, ikadalaw\u00e1)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3\n| tatl\u00f3\n| tres (tres)\n| pangatl\u00f3 / ikatl\u00f3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4\n| apat\n| kuwatro (cuatro)\n| pang-apat / ikaapat (\"ika\" and the number-word are never hyphenated.

In 1613, the Franciscan priest Pedro de San Buenaventura published the first Tagalog dictionary, his \"Vocabulario de la lengua tagala\" in Pila, Laguna.\n\nThe first substantial dictionary of the Tagalog language was written by the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Pablo Clain]] in the beginning of the 18th century. Clain spoke Tagalog and used it actively in several of his books.

The color-schemes represent the four dialect zones of the language: Northern, Central, Southern and [[Marinduque]]. While the majority of residents in [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Camarines Sur]] traditionally speak [[Bikol languages|Bikol]] as their first language, these provinces nonetheless have significant Tagalog minorities. In addition, Tagalog is used as a [[second language]] throughout the country.]]\n\nAt present, no comprehensive [[dialectology]] has been done in the Tagalog-speaking regions, though there have been descriptions in the form of dictionaries and grammars of various Tagalog dialects. [[Ethnologue]] lists Manila, Lubang, [[Marinduque]], Bataan (Western Central Luzon), [[Batangas Tagalog|Batangas]], Bulacan (Eastern Central Luzon), Tanay-Paete (Rizal-Laguna), and Tayabas (Quezon) as dialects of Tagalog; however, there appear to be four main dialects, of which the aforementioned are a part: Northern (exemplified by the [[Bulacan]] dialect), Central (including Manila), Southern (exemplified by Batangas), and Marinduque.\n\nSome example of dialectal differences are:\n* Many Tagalog dialects, particularly those in the south, preserve the glottal stop found after consonants and before vowels. This has been lost in Standard Tagalog. For example, standard Tagalog ''ngay\u00f3n'' (now, today), ''sinig\u00e1ng'' (broth stew), ''gab\u00ed'' (night), ''matam\u00eds'' (sweet), are pronounced and written ''ngay-on'', ''sinig-ang'', ''gab-i'', and ''matam-is'' in other dialects.\n* In [[Teresa, Rizal|Teresian]]-[[Morong, Rizal|Morong]] Tagalog, {{IPA|[\u027e]}} is usually preferred over {{IPA|[d]}}. For example, ''bund\u00f3k'', ''dagat'', ''dingd\u00edng'', and ''isd\u00e2'' become ''bunr\u00f3k'', ''ragat'', ''ringr\u00edng'', and ''isr\u00e2'', e.g. \"sand\u00f3k sa dingd\u00edng\" becoming \"sanr\u00f3k sa ringr\u00edng\".\n* In many [[Batangas Tagalog|southern dialects]], the progressive aspect infix of ''-um-'' verbs is ''na-''. For example, standard Tagalog ''kumakain'' (eating) is ''n\u00e1k\u00e1in'' in Quezon and Batangas Tagalog. This is the butt of some jokes by other Tagalog speakers, for should a Southern Tagalog ask ''n\u00e1k\u00e1in ka ba ng pat\u00edng?'' (\"Do you eat shark?\"), he would be understood as saying \"Has a shark eaten you?\" by speakers of the Manila Dialect.\n* Some dialects have interjections which are considered a regional trademark. For example, the interjection ''ala e!'' usually identifies someone from Batangas as does ''hane?!'' in Rizal and Quezon provinces.\n\nPerhaps the most divergent Tagalog dialects are those spoken in Marinduque.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Soberano |first=Ros| year=2015 |title=The dialects of Marinduque Tagalog |series=Pacific Linguistics - Series B No. 69 |location=Canberra |publisher=Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University |doi=10.15144/PL-B69}}</ref> Linguist Rosa Soberano identifies two dialects, western and eastern, with the former being closer to the Tagalog dialects spoken in the provinces of Batangas and Quezon.\n\nOne example is the verb conjugation paradigms. While some of the affixes are different, Marinduque also preserves the imperative affixes, also found in Visayan and Bikol languages, that have mostly disappeared from most Tagalog early 20th century; they have since merged with the infinitive.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Filipino language|Manila Tagalog]]\n! scope=\"col\" | Marinduque\u00f1o Tagalog\n! scope=\"col\" | English\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Susulat sin\u00e1 Mar\u00eda at Esperanza kay Juan.\n| M\u00e1s\u00falat da Mar\u00eda at Esperanza kay Juan.\n| \"Mar\u00eda and Esperanza will write to Juan.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mag-aaral siya sa Maynil\u00e0.\n| Gaaral siya sa Maynil\u00e0.\n| \"[He/She] will study in Manila.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Maglut\u00f2 ka na.\n| Paglut\u00f2.\n| \"Cook now.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Kainin mo iy\u00e1n.\n| Kaina yaan.\n| \"Eat it.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Tinatawag tayo ni Tatay.\n| Inatawag ngan\u00ec kit\u00e1 ni Tatay.\n| \"Father is calling us.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | T\u00fatulungan ba kay\u00f3 ni Hilario?\n| Atulungan ga kamo ni Hilario?\n| \"Is Hilario going to help you?\"\n|}\n\nNorthern and central dialects form the basis for the national language.\n\n===Accents===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Tagalog language also boasts [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accentations]] unique to some parts of [[Tagalog people|Tagalog-speaking regions]]. For example, in some parts of [[Manila]], a strong pronunciation of ''i'' exists and vowel-switching of ''o'' and ''u'' exists so words like \"gising\" (to wake) is pronounced as \"giseng\" with a strong 'e' and the word \"tagu-taguan\" (hide-and-go-seek) is pronounced as \"tago-tagoan\" with a mild 'o'.\n\n[[Batangas Tagalog]] boasts the most distinctive accent in Tagalog compared to the more Hispanized northern accents of the language.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The [[Batangas]] accent has been featured in film and television and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] actor [[Leo Martinez]] speaks with this accent. Martinez's accent, however, will quickly be recognized by native Batangue\u00f1os as representative of the accent in western Batangas which is milder compared to that used in the eastern part of the province.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nBulacan Tagalog has more [[Linguistic conservatism|deep words]] and accented like Filipino during the Spanish period.\n\nQuezon and Aurora's Tagalog has unique accents. Quezon's Tagalog has also has several unique words, and each town has a different tone, like in [[Sariaya]], [[Atimonan]] and [[Gumaca]].\n\nCavite accent specifically in the lowland part of the province were a mix of deep Tagalog and Chavacano, a language also spoken in Zamboanga while in upland Cavite like in the municipalities of [[Alfonso, Cavite]], [[Magallanes, Cavite]] as well as [[Tagaytay City]] uses the accent comparable to the accent used in western Batangas due to its proximity.\n\nLaguna also has a different set of accents, notably in the municipality of [[Alaminos, Laguna]] and the City of [[San Pablo, Laguna]] has the accent comparable to the accent used in eastern Batangas while the accent used in the northern parts of Laguna such as [[Bi\u00f1an, Laguna]] and [[San Pedro, Laguna]] uses the accent comparable to Manila Tagalog.\n\nNueva Ecija's accent is like Bulacan's, but with different intonations. Tarlac also has this accent.\n\n===Code-switching with English===\n{{main|Taglish}}\n\n''Taglish'' and ''Englog'' are names given to a mix of English and Tagalog. The amount of English vs. Tagalog varies from the occasional use of English loan words to changing language in mid-sentence. Such code-switching is prevalent throughout the Philippines and in various languages of the Philippines other than Tagalog.\n\nCode-mixing also entails the use of foreign words that are \"Filipinized\" by reforming them using Filipino rules, such as verb conjugations. Users typically use Filipino or English words, whichever comes to mind first or whichever is easier to use.\n\n{{Verse translation\n| Magshoshopping kami sa mall. Sino ba ang magdadrive sa shopping center?\n| We will go shopping at the mall. Who will drive to the shopping center?\n}}\n\nCity-dwellers are more likely to do this.\n\nThe practice is common in television, radio, and print media as well. Advertisements from companies like [[Wells Fargo]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[New Albertsons|Albertsons]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Western Union]] have contained Taglish.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Tagalog phonology}}\n{{IPA notice}}\nTagalog has 33 [[phoneme]]s: 19 of them are [[consonant]]s and 14 are [[vowel]]s. Syllable structure is relatively simple, being maximally CrVC, where Cr only occurs in borrowed words such as ''trak'' \"truck\" or ''sombr\u00e9ro'' \"hat\".<ref name=ELL>{{ELL2|Tagalog}}</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\nTagalog has ten simple vowels, five long and five short, and four diphthongs.<ref name=ELL/> Before appearing in the area north of the Pasig river, Tagalog had three vowel qualities: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}}. This was later expanded to five with the introduction of words from central and northern Philippines, such as the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]] and [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] languages, as well as Spanish words.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+caption | '''Table of the five general Tagalog vowel phonemes'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!\n!

Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1521 and the beginning of their colonization in 1565, Tagalog was written in an [[abugida]]\u2014or [[alphasyllabary]]\u2014called [[Baybayin]]. This system of writing gradually gave way to the use and propagation of the Latin alphabet as introduced by the Spanish. As the Spanish began to record and create grammars and dictionaries for the various languages of the Philippine archipelago, they adopted systems of writing closely following the orthographic customs of the Spanish language and were refined over the years. Until the first half of the 20th century, most Philippine languages were widely written in a variety of ways based on Spanish orthography.\n\nIn the late 19th century, a number of educated Filipinos began proposing for revising the spelling system used for Tagalog at the time. In 1884, Filipino doctor and student of languages [[Trinidad Pardo de Tavera]] published his study on the ancient Tagalog script ''Contribucion para el Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos'' and in 1887, published his essay ''El Sanscrito en la lengua Tagalog'' which made use of a new writing system developed by him. Meanwhile, Jose Rizal, inspired by Pardo de Tavera's 1884 work, also began developing a new system of orthography (unaware at first of Pardo de Tavera's own orthography).<ref name=\"Is k foreign 19\"/> A major noticeable change in these proposed orthographies was the use of the letter \u27e8k\u27e9 rather than \u27e8c\u27e9 and \u27e8q\u27e9 to represent the phoneme {{IPA|/k/}}.\n\nIn 1889, the new bilingual Spanish-Tagalog ''La Espa\u00f1a Oriental'' newspaper, of which [[Isabelo de los Reyes]] was an editor, began publishing using the new orthography stating in a footnote that it would \"use the orthography recently introduced by ... learned Orientalis\". This new orthography, while having its supporters, was also not initially accepted by several writers. Soon after the first issue of ''La Espa\u00f1a'', [[Pascual H. Poblete]]'s ''Revista Cat\u00f3lica de Filipina'' began a series of articles attacking the new orthography and its proponents. A fellow writer, Pablo Tecson was also critical. Among the attacks was the use of the letters \"k\" and \"w\" as they were deemed to be of German origin and thus its proponents were deemed as \"unpatriotic\". The publishers of these two papers would eventually merge as ''La Lectura Popular'' in January 1890 and would eventually make use of both spelling systems in its articles.<ref name=\"k is for\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Megan C.|title=K is for De-Kolonization: Anti-Colonial Nationalism and Orthographic Reform|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=8 October 2007|volume=49|issue=4|pages=938\u2013967|doi=10.1017/S0010417507000813}}</ref><ref name=\"Is k foreign 19\">{{cite web|title=Accusations of Foreign-ness of the Revista Cat\u00f3lica de Filipinas - Is 'K' a Foreign Agent?

In it, he addressed the criticisms of the new writing system by writers like Pobrete and Tecson and the simplicity, in his opinion, of the new orthography. Rizal described the orthography promoted by Pardo de Tavera as \"more perfect\" than what he himself had developed.<ref name=\"k is for\"/> The new orthography was however not broadly adopted initially and was used inconsistently in the bilingual periodicals of Manila until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"k is for\"/> The revolutionary society Kata\u00e1s-taasan, Kagalang-galang Katipunan ng\u0303 mg\u0303\u00e1 Anak ng\u0303 Bayan or [[Katipunan]] made use of the k-orthography and the letter k featured prominently on many of its flags and insignias.<ref name=\"k is for\"/>\n\nIn 1937, Tagalog was selected to serve as basis for the country's [[national language]]. In 1940, the ''Balar\u00edl\u00e0 ng Wikang Pambans\u00e2'' ({{lang-en|Grammar of the National Language}}) of grammarian [[Lope K. Santos]] introduced the [[Abakada script|Abakada]] alphabet. This alphabet consists of 20 letters and became the standard alphabet of the national language.<ref name=\"ebolusyon\">{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Ebolusyon ng Alpabetong Filipino | url=http://wika.pbworks.com/Kasaysayan | accessdate = 2010-06-22}}</ref> The orthography as used by Tagalog would eventually influence and spread to the systems of writing used by other Philippine languages (which had been using variants of the Spanish-based system of writing). In 1987, the ABAKADA was dropped and in its place is the expanded Filipino alphabet.\n\n===Baybayin===\n{{Main|Baybayin}}\n\nTagalog was written in an [[abugida]] ([[alphasyllabary]]) called [[Baybayin]] prior to the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, in the 16th century. This particular [[writing system]] was composed of symbols representing three [[vowel]]s and 14 [[consonant]]s. Belonging to the [[Brahmic family]] of scripts, it shares similarities with the [[Old Kawi]] script of [[Javanese language|Java]] and is believed to be descended from the script used by the [[Bugis]] in [[Sulawesi]].\n\nAlthough it enjoyed a relatively high level of literacy, Baybayin gradually fell into disuse in favor of the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] taught by the Spaniards during their rule.\n\nThere has been confusion of how to use Baybayin, which is actually an [[abugida]], or an [[alphasyllabary]], rather than an [[alphabet]]. Not every letter in the Latin alphabet is represented with one of those in the Baybayin alphasyllabary. Rather than letters being put together to make sounds as in Western languages, Baybayin uses symbols to represent syllables.\n\nA \"kudlit\" resembling an apostrophe is used above or below a symbol to change the vowel sound after its consonant. If the kudlit is used above, the vowel is an \"E\" or \"I\" sound. If the kudlit is used below, the vowel is an \"O\" or \"U\" sound. A special kudlit was later added by Spanish missionaries in which a cross placed below the symbol to get rid of the vowel sound all together, leaving a consonant. Previously, the consonant without a following vowel was simply left out (for example, ''bundok'' being rendered as ''budo''), forcing the reader to use context when reading such words.\n\nExample:\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em 0;\">[[File:Baybayin sample 02.jpg|Ba Be Bo B (in Baybayin)]]</div>\n\nBaybayin is encoded in Unicode version 3.2 in the range 1700-171F under the name \"Tagalog\".\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em 0;\">\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin A.svg|center|\u1700]] a || [[File:Baybayin E-I.svg|center|\u1701]] e/i || [[File:Baybayin O-U.svg|center|\u1702]] o/u\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ka.svg|center|\u1703]] ka || [[File:Baybayin Ga.svg|center|\u1704]] ga || [[File:Baybayin Nga.svg|center|\u1705]] nga\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ta.svg|center|\u1706]] ta || [[File:Baybayin Da.svg|center|\u1707]] da/ra || [[File:Baybayin Na.svg|center|\u1708]] na\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Pa.svg|center|\u1709]] pa || [[File:Baybayin Ba.svg|center|\u170a]] ba || [[File:Baybayin Ma.svg|center|\u170b]] ma\n|}\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| [[File:Baybayin Ya.svg|center|\u170c]] ya || [[File:Baybayin La.svg|center|\u170e]] la || [[File:Baybayin Wa.svg|center|\u170f]] wa || [[File:Baybayin Sa.svg|center|\u1710]] sa || [[File:Baybayin Ha.svg|center|\u1711]] ha\n|}\n</div>\n\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ vowels\n!

(Those are my clothe'''s''')) are abbreviations that are pronounced ''nang'' {{IPA|[na\u014b]}} and ''mang\u00e1'' {{IPA|[m\u0250\u02c8\u014ba]}}. ''Ng'', in most cases, roughly translates to \"of\" (ex. ''Siya ay kapatid '''ng''' nanay ko.'' She is the sibling ''of'' my mother) while ''nang'' usually means \"when\" or can describe how something is done or to what extent (equivalent to the suffix ''-ly'' in English adverbs), among other uses. \n* '''''Nang''' si Hudas ay nadul\u00e1s.''\u2014When [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] slipped.\n* ''Gumising siya '''nang''' <u>maaga</u>.''\u2014He woke up <u>early</u>.\n* ''Gumal\u00edng '''nang''' <u>{{sic|hide=y|todo}}</u> si Juan dahil nag-ensayo siya.''\u2014Juan <u>greatly</u> improved because he practiced.\n\nIn the first example, ''nang'' is used in lieu of the word ''noong'' (when; ''<u>Noong</u> si Hudas ay madulas''). In the second, ''nang'' describes that the person woke up (''gumising'') early (''maaga''); ''gumising nang maaga''. In the third, ''nang'' described up to what extent that Juan improved (''gumaling''), which is \"greatly\" (''nang {{sic|hide=y|todo}}''). In the latter two examples, the ligature ''na'' and its variants ''-ng'' and ''-g'' may also be used (''Gumising <u>na</u> maaga/Maaga<u>ng</u> gumising''; ''Gumaling <u>na</u> {{sic|hide=y|todo}}/Todo<u>ng</u> gumaling'').\n\nThe longer ''nang'' may also have other uses, such as a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] that joins a repeated word:\n*''Naghint\u00e1y sila '''nang''' naghint\u00e1y.''\u2014They kept on waiting\" (a closer calque: \"They were waiting and waiting.\")\n\n===''p\u00f4/h\u00f4'' and ''op\u00f2/oh\u00f2''===\nThe words ''p\u00f4/h\u00f4'' and ''op\u00f2/oh\u00f2'' are traditionally used as polite iterations of the affirmative \"''oo''\" (\"yes\"). It is generally used when addressing elders or superiors such as bosses or teachers.\n\n\"P\u00f4\" and \"op\u00f2\" are specifically used to denote a high level of respect when addressing older persons of close affinity like parents, relatives, teachers and family friends. \"H\u00f4\" and \"oh\u00f2\" are generally used to politely address older neighbours, strangers, public officials, bosses and nannies, and may suggest a distance in societal relationship and respect determined by the addressee's social rank and not their age. However, \"p\u00f4\" and \"op\u00f2\" can be used in any case in order to express an elevation of respect.\n*Example: \"''Pakitapon naman '''p\u00f4/ho''' yung basura.''\" (\"Please throw away the trash.\")\n\nUsed in the affirmative:\n*Ex: \"''Gut\u00f3m ka na ba?\" \"'''Op\u00f2/Oh\u00f2'''''\". (\"Are you hungry yet?\" \"Yes.\")\n\n''P\u00f4/H\u00f4'' may also be used in negation.\n*Ex: \"''Hindi ko '''p\u00f4/h\u00f4''' alam 'yan.''\" (\"I don't know that.\")\n\n==Vocabulary and borrowed words==\n{{see also|List of loanwords in Tagalog}}\n\nTagalog vocabulary is composed mostly of words of native Austronesian origin - most of the words that end with the [[diphthongs]] -iw, (e.g. saliw) and those words that exhibit [[reduplication]] (e.g. halo-halo, patpat, etc.). However it has a significant number of Spanish loanwords. Spanish is the language that has bequeathed the most loanwords to Tagalog.\n\nIn pre-Hispanic times, [[Malay trade and creole languages|Trade Malay]] was widely known and spoken throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].\n\nTagalog also includes many loanwords from English, [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]), [[Chinese language]]s ([[Hokkien]], [[Cantonese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].\n\nDue to trade with Mexico via the [[Manila galleon]]s from the 16th to the 19th centuries, many words from [[Nahuatl]] (Aztec) and Castilian (Spanish) were introduced to Tagalog.\n\nThe Philippines has long been a melting pot of nations. The islands have been subject to different influences and a meeting point of numerous migrations since the early prehistoric origins of trading activities, especially from the time of the Neolithic Period, the [[Silk Road]], the [[Tang Dynasty]], the [[Ming Dynasty]], the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]], the [[Spice Route]] and the [[Manila Galleon]] trading periods. This means that the evolution of the language is difficult to reconstruct (although many theories exist).\n\nEnglish has borrowed some words from Tagalog, such as abaca, barong, [[butterfly knife|balisong]], [[boondocks]], [[jeepney]], Manila hemp, [[pancit]], ylang-ylang, and yaya, although the vast majority of these borrowed words are only used in the Philippines as part of the vocabularies of [[Philippine English]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Other examples of Tagalog words used in English\n! scope=\"col \" | Example\n! scope=\"col \" | Definition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[boondocks]]\n| meaning \"rural\" or \"back country,\" was imported by American soldiers stationed in the Philippines following the Spanish\u2013American War as a mispronounced version of the Tagalog ''bundok'', which means \"mountain.\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | cogon\n| a type of grass, used for thatching.

The first Bible in Tagalog, then called ''Ang Biblia''<ref>Worth, Roland H. ''Biblical Studies On The Internet: A Resource Guide'', 2008 (p. 43)</ref> (\"the Bible\") and now called ''Ang Dating Biblia''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adb.scripturetext.com/genesis/1.htm |title=Genesis 1 Tagalog: Ang Dating Biblia (1905) |publisher=Adb.scripturetext.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> (\"the Old Bible\"), was published in 1905. In 1970, the [[Philippine Bible Society]] translated the [[Bible]] into modern Tagalog. Even before the [[Second Vatican Council]], devotional materials in Tagalog had been in circulation. There are at least four circulating Tagalog translations of the Bible\n* the ''[[Magandang Balita Biblia]]'' (a parallel translation of the ''[[Good News Bible]]''), which is the [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] version\n* the [[Bibliya ng Sambayanang Pilipino]]\n* the 1905 ''Ang Biblia'' is a more Protestant version\n* the ''Bagong Sanlibutang Salin ng Banal na Kasulatan'' (''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'')\n\nWhen the [[Second Vatican Council]], (specifically the [[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]) permitted the universal prayers to be translated into [[Vernacular|vernacular languages]], the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] was one of the first to translate the [[Roman Missal]] into Tagalog. The [[Roman Missal]] in Tagalog was published as early as 1982.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses were printing Tagalog literature at least as early as 1941<ref>{{cite book|title=2003 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|page=155|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> and ''[[The Watchtower]]'' (the primary magazine of Jehovah's Witnesses) has been published in Tagalog since at least the 1950s. New releases are now regularly released simultaneously in a number of languages, including Tagalog. The official website of Jehovah's Witnesses also has some publications available online in Tagalog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wol.jw.org/tl/wol/h/r27/lp-tg|title=Watchtower Online Library (Tagalog)|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref> The revised [[bible]] edition, the ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,'' was released in Tagalog on 2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jw.org/en/whats-new/nwt-tagalog/#?insight[search_id]=bafc855e-cdb8-464c-9c65-a909a69e59a3&insight[search_result_index]=6|title=New World Translation Released in Tagalog|last=|first=|date=January 21, 2019|website=Jw.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and it is distributed without charge both printed and [https://www.jw.org/tl/library/bibliya/nwt/mga-aklat/ online versions].\n\nTagalog is quite a stable language, and very few revisions have been made to Catholic [[Bible translations]]. Also, as Protestantism in the Philippines is relatively young, [[liturgy|liturgical]] prayers tend to be more [[ecumenism|ecumenical]].\n\n==Examples==\n===Lord's Prayer===\nIn Tagalog, the [[Lord's Prayer]] is exclusively known by its [[incipit]], ''Am\u00e1 Namin'' (literally, \"Our Father\").\n\n{{Poemquote\n| style=font-style:italic; line-height:2.1em;\n| text=\nAm\u00e1 namin, sumasalangit Ka,\nSambah\u00edn ang ngalan Mo.\nMapasaamin ang kahari\u00e1n Mo.\nSund\u00edn ang lo\u00f3b Mo,\nDito sa lup\u00e0, gaya nang sa langit.\nBigy\u00e1n Mo kam\u00ed ngay\u00f3n ng aming kakanin sa araw-araw,\nAt patawarin Mo kam\u00ed sa aming mga sal\u00e2,\nPara nang pagp\u00e1patawad namin,\nSa nagkakasal\u00e0 sa amin;\nAt huw\u00e1g Mo kam\u00edng ipahintulot sa tuks\u00f3,\nAt iady\u00e2 Mo kam\u00ed sa lah\u00e1t ng masam\u00e2.\n[Sapagk\u00e1t sa Iny\u00f3 ang kahari\u00e1n, at ang kapangyarihan,\nAt ang kaluw\u00e1lhatian, ngay\u00f3n, at magpakailanman.]\nAmen.\n}}\n\n===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===\nThis is Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (''P\u00e1ngkalahat\u00e1ng Pagpapahayag ng Karapat\u00e1ng Pantao'')\n\n{{Verse translation\n| lang=tl\n| Bawat tao'y isinilang na may lay\u00e0 at magkakapant\u00e1y ang tagl\u00e1y na dang\u00e1l at karapat\u00e1n.

The first set consists of native Tagalog words and the other set are Spanish loanwords. (This may be compared to other East Asian languages, except with the second set of numbers borrowed from Spanish instead of Chinese.) For example, when a person refers to the number \"seven\", it can be translated into Tagalog as \"''pito''\" or \"''siyete''\" (Spanish: ''siete'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Number\n! scope=\"col\" | Cardinal\n! scope=\"col\" | Spanish loanword<br />(Original Spanish)\n! scope=\"col\" | Ordinal\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 0\n| sero / wal\u00e2 (lit. \"null\") / aw\u00e1n\n| sero (cero)\n| -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1\n| is\u00e1\n| uno (uno)\n| una\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2\n| dalaw\u00e1 [dalaua]\n| dos (dos)\n| pangalaw\u00e1 / ikalaw\u00e1 (informally, ikadalaw\u00e1)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3\n| tatl\u00f3\n| tres (tres)\n| pangatl\u00f3 / ikatl\u00f3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4\n| apat\n| kuwatro (cuatro)\n| pang-apat / ikaapat (\"ika\" and the number-word are never hyphenated.

In general: refers to how some things are inevitable, no matter how long you try to postpone it.)\n\n''Kung 'd\u00ee m\u00e1da\u00e1n sa sant\u00f3ng dasalan, daanin sa sant\u00f3ng paspasan.''<br />If it cannot be got through holy prayer, get it through blessed force.<br />\n(In romance and courting: ''sant\u00f3ng paspasan'' literally means 'holy speeding' and is a euphemism for [[sexual intercourse]]. It refers to the two styles of courting by Filipino boys: one is the traditional, protracted, restrained manner favored by older generations, which often featured [[Harana (serenade)|serenades]] and manual labor for the girl's family; the other is upfront seduction, which may lead to a slap on the face or a pregnancy out of wedlock. The second conclusion is known as ''pikot'' or what Western cultures would call a '[[shotgun marriage]]'. This proverb is also applied in terms of diplomacy and negotiation.)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dambana]]\n*[[Abakada alphabet]]\n*[[Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino]]\n*[[Filipino alphabet]]\n*[[Old Tagalog]]\n*[[Filipino orthography]]\n*[[Tagalog Wikipedia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277951403|title=The Politics of \"P\" and \"F\": A Linguistic History of Nation-Building in the Philippines|last=Tupas|first=Ruanni|journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|volume=36|issue=6|pages=587\u2013597|year=2015|doi=10.1080/01434632.2014.979831}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary category|category=Tagalog language}}\n{{InterWiki|code=tl|Tagalog}}\n{{Wikibooks|Tagalog}}\n{{WikisourceWiki|Tagalog}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Filipino phrasebook}}\n{{Commons category|Tagalog language}}\n* [http://tagalog.pinoydictionary.com/ Tagalog Dictionary]\n* [http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/tagalog_verbs.htm Tagalog verbs with conjugation]\n* [https://www.tagaloglessons.com/dictionary/ Tagalog Lessons Dictionary]\n* [https://www.tagaloglike.com/ Tagalog Quotes]\n* [https://www.patamatagalogquotes.com/ Patama Quotes]\n* [https://www.tagalogtranslate.com/ Tagalog Translate]\n* [http://tagalogforum.com/ Tagalog Forum]\n* [[Kaipuleohone]] [https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/34061 archive of Tagalog]\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Tagalog\n|list1=\n{{Languages of the Philippines}}\n{{Philippine languages}}\n}}\n{{Portal bar|Philippines|Language}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tagalog language}}\n[[Category:Languages attested from the 10th century]]\n[[Category:Languages of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Tagalog language| ]]\n[[Category:Central Philippine languages]]\n[[Category:Agglutinative languages]]\n[[Category:Subject\u2013verb\u2013object languages]]\n[[Category:Verb\u2013object\u2013subject languages]]\n[[Category:Verb\u2013subject\u2013object languages]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "miscapitalization", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog_language"}

Echoing an earlier rabbinic comment found in the commentary of Rashi to the Songs of Songs (4:5) Ginzberg explained\u2014there is also a great bond of union between the first five commandments and the last five. The first commandment: \"I am the Lord, thy God,\" corresponds to the sixth: \"Thou shalt not kill,\" for the murderer slays the image of God. The second: \"Thou shalt have no strange gods before me,\" corresponds to the seventh: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" for conjugal faithlessness is as grave a sin as idolatry, which is faithlessness to God. The third commandment: \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain,\" corresponds to the eighth: \"Thou shalt not steal,\" for stealing result in false oath in God's name. The fourth: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\" corresponds to the ninth: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,\" for he who bears false witness against his neighbor commits as grave a sin as if he had borne false witness against God, saying that He had not created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day (the holy Sabbath). The fifth commandment: \"Honor thy father and thy mother,\" corresponds to the tenth: \"Covet not thy neighbor's wife,\" for one who indulges this lust produces children who will not honor their true father, but will consider a stranger their father.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS ''The Legends of the Jews'', Vol. III: The Unity of Ten Commandments] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807032722/https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS |date=7 August 2018 }}, (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Rabbinical Jewish belief is that the observance of these commandments and the other ''mitzvot'' are required solely of the Jewish people and that the laws incumbent on humanity in general are outlined in the seven [[Noahide laws]], several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments.

However, the Gospel of Barnabas does not form part of the Christian bible.  It is known only from 16th- and 17th-century manuscripts, and frequently reflects Islamic rather than Christian understandings<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne}}</ref>, so it cannot be taken as authoritative on Christian views.\n\nIn Christianity's earliest centuries, some Christians had informally adorned their homes and places of worship with images of Christ and the saints, which others thought inappropriate. No church council had ruled on whether such practices constituted idolatry. The controversy reached crisis level in the 8th century, during the period of [[iconoclasm]]: the smashing of icons,{{fact|date=February 2020}} and again in the Middle Ages, becoming a critical point of contention in the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 726 [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] ordered all images removed from all churches; in 730 a council forbade veneration of images, citing the Second Commandment; in 787 the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] reversed the preceding rulings, condemning iconoclasm and sanctioning the veneration of images; in 815 [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] called yet another council, which reinstated iconoclasm; in 843 [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Empress Theodora]] again reinstated veneration of icons.{{fact|date=February 2020}} This mostly settled the matter until the Reformation, when [[John Calvin]] declared that the ruling of the Seventh Ecumenical Council \"emanated from Satan\".{{fact|date=February 2020}} Protestant iconoclasts at this time destroyed statues, pictures, stained glass, and artistic masterpieces.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates Theodora's restoration of the icons every year on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]].{{fact|date=February 2020}} Eastern Orthodox tradition teaches that while images of God, the Father, remain prohibited, depictions of Jesus as the incarnation of God as a visible human are permissible.

Levinson]] argued that this reconstruction assumes a Christian perspective, and dates back to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s polemic against Judaism, which asserted that religions evolve from the more [[ritual]]istic to the more [[ethic]]al. Goethe thus argued that the Ten Commandments revealed to Moses at [[Mt. Sinai]] would have emphasized rituals, and that the \"ethical\" Decalogue Christians recite in their own churches was composed at a later date, when Israelite prophets had begun to prophesy the coming of the [[messiah]]. Levinson points out that there is no evidence, internal to the Hebrew Bible or in external sources, to support this conjecture. He concludes that its vogue among later critical historians represents the persistence of the idea that the [[supersession]] of Judaism by Christianity is part of a longer history of progress from the ritualistic to the ethical.<ref>Levinson, Bernard M. (July 2002). \"Goethe's Analysis of Exodus 34 and Its Influence on Julius Wellhausen: the Pfropfung of the Documentary Hypothesis\". ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft'' 114 (2): 212\u2013223</ref>\n\nBy the 1930s, historians who accepted the basic premises of multiple authorship had come to reject the idea of an orderly evolution of Israelite religion. Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times. This means that there is no longer any ''a priori'' reason to believe that Exodus 20:2\u201317 and Exodus 34:10\u201328 were composed during different stages of Israelite history. For example, critical historian [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] also dates the Jahwist texts to the tenth century BCE, but believes that they express a theology that \"had already been normalized in the period of the Judges\" (i.e., of the tribal alliance).<ref>John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition.

It is likely to be an independent document, which was inserted here by the Redactor.\"<ref>Friedman, p. 153</ref> In his view, the [[Covenant Code]] follows that version of the Ten Commandments in the northern Israel E narrative. In the J narrative in Exodus 34 the editor of the combined story known as the Redactor (or RJE), adds in an explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets which were shattered. \"In the combined JE text, it would be awkward to picture God just commanding Moses to make some tablets, as if there were no history to this matter, so RJE adds the explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets that were shattered.\"<ref>Friedman, p. 177</ref>\n\nHe writes that Exodus 34:14\u201326 is the J text of the Ten Commandments: \"The first two commandments and the sabbath commandment have parallels in the other versions of the Ten Commandments.

Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]],<ref>PCUSA Assembly Committee on General Assembly Procedures D.3.a http://apps.pcusa.org/ga216/business/commbooks/comm03.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the [[American Jewish Congress]]<ref>American Jewish Congress, \"AJCongress Voices Opposition to Courtroom Display of ten Commandments,\" (May 16, 2003) http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904031027/http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 |date=4 September 2014 }}</ref>), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider [[culture war]] between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]], have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] as a threat to the expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.\n\nThose who oppose the posting of the ten commandments on public property argue that it violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display of the ten commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge [[Roy Moore]] that prohibiting the public practice of religion is a violation of the first amendment's guarantee of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|freedom of religion]].<ref name=\"moses.creighton.edu\" />\n\n[[File:1 Gebot (Lucas Cranach d A).jpg|thumb|''The Ten Commandments'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the townhall of [[Wittenberg]] (detail)]]\nU.S. courts have often ruled against displays of the Ten Commandments on government property. They conclude that the ten commandments are derived from [[Judeo-Christian]] religions, to the exclusion of others: the statement \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" excludes non-monotheistic religions like [[Hinduism]], for example. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the [[appearance of impropriety]]. The courts have been more accepting, however, of displays that place the Ten Commandments in a broader historical context of the development of law.\n\nOne result of these legal cases has been that proponents of displaying the Ten Commandments have sometimes surrounded them with other historical texts to portray them as historical, rather than religious. Another result has been that other religious organizations have tried to put monuments to their laws on public lands. For example, an organization called [[Summum]] has won court cases against municipalities in [[Utah]] for refusing to allow the group to erect a monument of Summum [[aphorisms]] next to the ten commandments. The cases were won on the grounds that Summum's right to [[freedom of speech]] was denied and the governments had engaged in [[discrimination]]. Instead of allowing Summum to erect its monument, the local governments chose to remove their ten commandments.\n\n==Cultural references==\nTwo famous films with this name were directed by [[Cecil B.

Echoing an earlier rabbinic comment found in the commentary of Rashi to the Songs of Songs (4:5) Ginzberg explained\u2014there is also a great bond of union between the first five commandments and the last five. The first commandment: \"I am the Lord, thy God,\" corresponds to the sixth: \"Thou shalt not kill,\" for the murderer slays the image of God. The second: \"Thou shalt have no strange gods before me,\" corresponds to the seventh: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" for conjugal faithlessness is as grave a sin as idolatry, which is faithlessness to God. The third commandment: \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain,\" corresponds to the eighth: \"Thou shalt not steal,\" for stealing result in false oath in God's name. The fourth: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\" corresponds to the ninth: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,\" for he who bears false witness against his neighbor commits as grave a sin as if he had borne false witness against God, saying that He had not created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day (the holy Sabbath). The fifth commandment: \"Honor thy father and thy mother,\" corresponds to the tenth: \"Covet not thy neighbor's wife,\" for one who indulges this lust produces children who will not honor their true father, but will consider a stranger their father.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS ''The Legends of the Jews'', Vol. III: The Unity of Ten Commandments] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807032722/https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS |date=7 August 2018 }}, (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Rabbinical Jewish belief is that the observance of these commandments and the other ''mitzvot'' are required solely of the Jewish people and that the laws incumbent on humanity in general are outlined in the seven [[Noahide laws]], several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments.

Islam has a stronger prohibition, banning representations of God, and in some cases of Muhammad, humans and, in some interpretations, any living creature.\n\nIn the non-canonical [[Gospel of Barnabas]], it is claimed that Jesus stated that idolatry is the greatest sin as it divests a man fully of faith, and hence of God.<ref>[http://www.barnabas.net/index.php/chapters/424-chapter-32-statues-of-flesh Chapter 32: Statues of Flesh] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115071747/http://www.barnabas.net/index.php/chapters/424-chapter-32-statues-of-flesh |date=15 January 2018 }} ''Barnabas.net''</ref> The words attributed to Jesus prohibit not only worshipping statues of wood or stone; but also statues of flesh. ''\"...all which a man loves, for which he leaves everything else but that, is his god, thus the glutton and drunkard has for his idol his own flesh, the fornicator has for his idol the harlot and the greedy has for his idol silver and gold, and so the same for every other sinner.\"''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110826202022/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/arts/barnabas/Barncoloured.html Gospel of Barnabas chapter XXXIII] ''Latrobe Edu''</ref>  Idolatory was thus the basic sin, which manifested in various acts or thoughts, which displace the primacy of God.  However, the Gospel of Barnabas does not form part of the Christian bible.  It is known only from 16th- and 17th-century manuscripts, and frequently reflects Islamic rather than Christian understandings<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne}}</ref>, so it cannot be taken as authoritative on Christian views.\n\nIn Christianity's earliest centuries, some Christians had informally adorned their homes and places of worship with images of Christ and the saints, which others thought inappropriate. No church council had ruled on whether such practices constituted idolatry. The controversy reached crisis level in the 8th century, during the period of [[iconoclasm]]: the smashing of icons,{{fact|date=February 2020}} and again in the Middle Ages, becoming a critical point of contention in the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 726 [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] ordered all images removed from all churches; in 730 a council forbade veneration of images, citing the Second Commandment; in 787 the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] reversed the preceding rulings, condemning iconoclasm and sanctioning the veneration of images; in 815 [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] called yet another council, which reinstated iconoclasm; in 843 [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Empress Theodora]] again reinstated veneration of icons.{{fact|date=February 2020}} This mostly settled the matter until the Reformation, when [[John Calvin]] declared that the ruling of the Seventh Ecumenical Council \"emanated from Satan\".{{fact|date=February 2020}} Protestant iconoclasts at this time destroyed statues, pictures, stained glass, and artistic masterpieces.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates Theodora's restoration of the icons every year on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]].{{fact|date=February 2020}} Eastern Orthodox tradition teaches that while images of God, the Father, remain prohibited, depictions of Jesus as the incarnation of God as a visible human are permissible. To emphasize the theological importance of the incarnation, the Orthodox Church encourages the use of icons in church and private devotions, but prefers a two-dimensional depiction<ref name=Hore>Alexander Hugh Hore, [https://archive.org/details/eighteencenturi00horegoog/page/n265 <!-- pg=353 quote=\"flat pictures\". --> ''Eighteen Centuries of the Orthodox Church''], J.

Levinson]] argued that this reconstruction assumes a Christian perspective, and dates back to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s polemic against Judaism, which asserted that religions evolve from the more [[ritual]]istic to the more [[ethic]]al. Goethe thus argued that the Ten Commandments revealed to Moses at [[Mt. Sinai]] would have emphasized rituals, and that the \"ethical\" Decalogue Christians recite in their own churches was composed at a later date, when Israelite prophets had begun to prophesy the coming of the [[messiah]]. Levinson points out that there is no evidence, internal to the Hebrew Bible or in external sources, to support this conjecture. He concludes that its vogue among later critical historians represents the persistence of the idea that the [[supersession]] of Judaism by Christianity is part of a longer history of progress from the ritualistic to the ethical.<ref>Levinson, Bernard M. (July 2002). \"Goethe's Analysis of Exodus 34 and Its Influence on Julius Wellhausen: the Pfropfung of the Documentary Hypothesis\".

Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times. This means that there is no longer any ''a priori'' reason to believe that Exodus 20:2\u201317 and Exodus 34:10\u201328 were composed during different stages of Israelite history. For example, critical historian [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] also dates the Jahwist texts to the tenth century BCE, but believes that they express a theology that \"had already been normalized in the period of the Judges\" (i.e., of the tribal alliance).<ref>John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition.

Hundreds of monuments were also  placed by [[film director|director]] [[Cecil B.

Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]],<ref>PCUSA Assembly Committee on General Assembly Procedures D.3.a http://apps.pcusa.org/ga216/business/commbooks/comm03.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the [[American Jewish Congress]]<ref>American Jewish Congress, \"AJCongress Voices Opposition to Courtroom Display of ten Commandments,\" (May 16, 2003) http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904031027/http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 |date=4 September 2014 }}</ref>), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider [[culture war]] between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]], have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] as a threat to the expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.\n\nThose who oppose the posting of the ten commandments on public property argue that it violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display of the ten commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge [[Roy Moore]] that prohibiting the public practice of religion is a violation of the first amendment's guarantee of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|freedom of religion]].<ref name=\"moses.creighton.edu\" />\n\n[[File:1 Gebot (Lucas Cranach d A).jpg|thumb|''The Ten Commandments'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the townhall of [[Wittenberg]] (detail)]]\nU.S. courts have often ruled against displays of the Ten Commandments on government property. They conclude that the ten commandments are derived from [[Judeo-Christian]] religions, to the exclusion of others: the statement \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" excludes non-monotheistic religions like [[Hinduism]], for example. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the [[appearance of impropriety]]. The courts have been more accepting, however, of displays that place the Ten Commandments in a broader historical context of the development of law.\n\nOne result of these legal cases has been that proponents of displaying the Ten Commandments have sometimes surrounded them with other historical texts to portray them as historical, rather than religious. Another result has been that other religious organizations have tried to put monuments to their laws on public lands. For example, an organization called [[Summum]] has won court cases against municipalities in [[Utah]] for refusing to allow the group to erect a monument of Summum [[aphorisms]] next to the ten commandments. The cases were won on the grounds that Summum's right to [[freedom of speech]] was denied and the governments had engaged in [[discrimination]]. Instead of allowing Summum to erect its monument, the local governments chose to remove their ten commandments.\n\n==Cultural references==\nTwo famous films with this name were directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]]: a [[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|silent movie which was released in 1923]] and starred [[Theodore Roberts]] as Moses and a colour [[VistaVision]] [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|version which was released in 1956]], and starred [[Charlton Heston]] as Moses.\n\nBoth ''[[Dekalog]]'', a 1989 Polish film series directed by [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]], and ''[[The Ten]]'', a 2007 American film, use the ten commandments as a structure for 10 smaller stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811106/|title=The Ten|accessdate=8 April 2020|via=www.imdb.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307211234/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811106/|archive-date=7 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe receipt of the Ten Commandments by Moses was satirized in [[Mel Brooks]]'s movie ''[[History of the World Part I]]'' (1981), which shows Moses (played by Brooks, in a similar costume to [[Charlton Heston]]'s Moses in the [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|1956 film]]), receiving three tablets containing fifteen commandments, but before he can present them to his people, he stumbles and drops one of the tablets, shattering it. He then presents the remaining tablets, proclaiming Ten Commandments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah-WdAwVg9c/ |title=Fifteen Commandments |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2012-08-10 |accessdate=2018-04-05}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'', a 1998 animated film that depicted the early life of Moses (voiced by [[Val Kilmer]]), the final shot depicts him with the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai, accompanied by a reprise of \"[[Deliver Us (The Prince of Egypt)|Deliver Us]]\".\n\nThe story of Moses and the Ten Commandments is discussed in the Danish stageplay ''[[Biblen]]'' (2008).\n\nIn the [[The Seven Deadly Sins (manga)|Seven Deadly Sins]] manga-franchise, there is an elite force of 10 demons called Ten Commandments, whose each has a special curse from a Demon King (commandment). The effects of each Commandment loosely bases on to the real Ten Commandments from the Abrahamic Religions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bible}}\n* [[Alternatives to the Ten Commandments]] \u2013 Secular and humanist alternatives to the biblical lists\n* [[Code of Hammurabi]] (1772 BC)\n* [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] (2050 BC)\n* [[Divine command theory]]\n* [[Five Precepts (Taoism)]]\n* [[Five Precepts]] ([[Buddhism]])\n* [[Eight precepts]] ([[Buddhism]])\n* [[Maat]], 42 confessions, ' The negative confession ' (1500 BC) of the [[Papyrus of Ani]], which is also known as The declaration of innocence before the Gods of the tribunal from The book of going forth by day, also [[Book of the Dead]]\n* [[Seven Laws of Noah]]\n* [[The Ten Commandments (2007 film)|''The Ten Commandments'' (2007 film)]]\n* ''[[K10C: Kids' Ten Commandments]]''\n* [[Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics]]\n* [[Ten Conditions of Bai'at]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Further reading |date=June 2015}}\n* {{cite book|last=Aaron |first=David H |year=2006 |title=Etched in Stone: The Emergence of the Decalogue |publisher=Continuum |isbn=0-567-02791-0}}\n* {{cite book|last=Abdrushin |year=2009 |title=The Ten Commandments of God and the Lord's Prayer |publisher=Grail Foundation Press |isbn=978-1-57461-004-8}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20100523082204/http://the10com.org/index.html The Ten Commandments of God and The Lord's Prayer]\n* Peter Barenboim, [http://www.florentine-society.ru/pdf/Biblical_Roots_of_Separation_of_Powers.pdf ''Biblical Roots of Separation of Powers'', Moscow, 2005], {{ISBN|5-94381-123-0}}.\n* {{cite book|last=Boltwood |first=Emily |year=2012 |title=10 Simple Rules of the House of Gloria |publisher=Tate Publishing |isbn=978-1-62024-840-9}}\n* {{cite book |last=Freedman |first=David Noel |authorlink=David Noel Freedman |year=2000 |title=The Nine Commandments.

He was a son of [[John II of Pfalz-Simmern|John II of Simmern]] and inherited the Palatinate from the childless Elector [[Otto-Henry, Elector Palatine]] (''Ottheinrich'') in 1559. He was a devout convert to [[Calvinism]], and made the Reformed confession the official religion of his domain by overseeing the composition and promulgation of the [[Heidelberg Catechism]]. His support of Calvinism gave the German Reformed movement a foothold within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\n==Life==\n[[Image:Frederick III, Elector Palatine.jpg|thumb|right|Frederick III and his wives, Marie of Brandenburg and Amalia of Neuenahr]]\nFrederick was strictly educated in the Roman faith at his father's court and at [[Cologne]], but, influenced by his wife, the pious princess [[Marie of Brandenburg-Kulmbach|Maria of Brandenburg]], whom he married in 1537, he followed the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and in 1546 made a public profession of his faith. He succeeded his father John II as duke of [[Simmern]] on 18 May 1557, and became elector on 12 February 1559, on the death of Otto Henry. Under his predecessor [[Gnesio-Lutherans|strict Lutherans]] like [[Tilemann Heshusius]], [[Melanchthonians]], and [[Calvinists]] had found a place in the Palatinate. In the summer of 1559 bitter controversies arose among them. Theses on the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] prepared by the [[Heidelberg]] deacon Wilhelm Klebitz provoked a bitter controversy between him and Heshusius.\n\nWhen efforts at mediation failed Frederick deposed both men on 16 September 1559. To get a clear understanding of the controversy Frederick spent days and nights in theological studies and was thus led more and more to the Reformed confession. A disputation held in June 1560 between the Saxon theologians [[Johann St\u00f6ssel]] and [[Joachim M\u00f6rlin]] and the Heidelbergers [[Pierre Boquin]], [[Thomas Erastus]], and Paul Einhorn increased Frederick's dislike for the Lutheran zealots. After the [[Naumburg Convention]] (January, 1561) Frederick fully adopted the Reformed dogmas.\n\nIn March 1561 he invited [[Emmanuel Tremellius]] to Heidelberg, and in September the famous [[Zacharius Ursinus]]. The whole Church was now transformed. [[Caspar Olevianus]] had been there since January 1560. Images of the saints, [[vestments]], baptismal fonts, and other \"idolatrous works,\" even organs, were ruthlessly removed from the churches. In the celebration of the Lord's Supper the breaking of bread was introduced. The revenues from monasteries and foundations were confiscated and applied to Evangelical church purposes or charity. The [[Heidelberg Catechism]], prepared by a committee of theologians and ministers likely led by Ursinus, now served as the norm of doctrine and for the instruction of the youth.\n\nThe church order of 15 November 1563 and the [[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistory]] order of 1564 consolidated the changes. The opposition of ministers inclining to Lutheranism was suppressed by their dismissal. Among the Lutherans, Frederick's measures caused a great sensation. The religious colloquy held at [[Maulbronn]] in April 1564 increased the animosity. In 1565 the [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian]] ordered the changes to be annulled. A unanimous decree of the 1566 [[Diet of Augsburg]] also demanded the abolition of the changes. Frederick, however, declared in the 14 May session of the Diet that a matter was concerned over which God alone has the rule, and if it was intended to proceed against him, he would find comfort in the promises of his Saviour. The decree was not carried out.\n\nAfter completing the work of reform in the [[Rhine Palatinate]], Frederick endeavored to continue it in the [[Upper Palatinate]]; but here he was resisted by the zealous Lutheran estates. He continued his work of reform on the Rhine by introducing in 1570 a strict church discipline. Frederick pronounced the sentence of death on the Antitrinitarian [[Johann Sylvan]] based on the opinion signed by Olevianus, Ursinus, and Boquin, on 23 December 1572.\n\nIn 1562 Frederick gave [[Frankenthal]] as a refuge to the Evangelicals driven from the [[Netherlands]]. He sent his like-minded son [[Johann Casimir]] in 1567 and again in 1576 to [[France]] in aid of the [[Huguenots]]. In 1569 he assisted also the Count Palatine [[Wolfgang of Pfalz-Zweibr\u00fccken]] on his way to France. \n\nFrederick's last years were troubled by domestic afflictions. As his older son Louis was a strict Lutheran, he could not hope that after his death his work would be carried out in his own spirit.\n\n==Family and children==\nFrederick III was married twice. Firstly, he married in 1537  [[Marie of Brandenburg-Kulmbach]] (1519 &ndash; 1567), daughter of [[Casimir, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth]] and [[Susanna of Bavaria]]. Their children were:\n# Alberta (4 April 1538 &ndash; 19 March 1553)\n# [[Louis VI, Elector Palatine]] (4 July 1539 &ndash; 22 October 1583)\n# [[Countess Palatine Elisabeth of Simmern-Sponheim|Elisabeth]] (30 June 1540 &ndash; 8 February 1594), married in 1558 to Duke [[Johann Frederick II, Duke of Saxony|Johann Frederick II of Saxony]]\n# Hermann Ludwig (6 October 1541 &ndash; 1 July 1556)\n# [[Johann Casimir of Simmern|Johann Casimir]] (7 March 1543 &ndash; 16 January 1592); married: 1570 [[Elisabeth of Saxony]] (18 October 1552 - 2 April 1590)\n# [[Dorothea Susanne of Simmern|Dorothea Susanne]] (15 November 1544] &ndash; 8 April 1592), married in 1560 to [[John William, Duke of Saxe-Weimar]]\n# Albert (30 September 1546 &ndash; 30 April 1547)\n# Anna Elisabeth (23 July 1549 &ndash; 20 September 1609), married:\n## in 1569 to Landgrave [[Philipp II of Hesse-Rheinfels]];\n## in 1599 to Count Palatine [[John Augustus, Count Palatine of L\u00fctzelstein|John August of Veldenz]]\n# Christof (13 June 1551 &ndash; 14 April 1574)\n# Karl (28 December 1552 &ndash; 12 September 1555)\n# Kunigunde Jakob\u00e4a (9 October 1556 &ndash; 26 January 1586), married in 1580 to Count [[John VI of Nassau-Dillenburg]]\n\nSecondly, he married in 1569 [[Amalia of Neuenahr]] ( 1539 &ndash; 1602), but this marriage was childless.\n\nHe died in 1576, and was succeeded as Elector Palatine by his son [[Louis VI, Elector Palatine|Louis VI]]. Frederick had carved out a territory from the Lower Palatine land dubbed \"Pfalz-Lautern\" for his second surviving son [[Johann Casimir]] as an enclave to enable the continued existence of the Reformed faith. Johann Casimir would serve as regent for the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] upon Louis VI's death and would oversee the return of the Reformed faith to the Palatinate.\n\n== Literature ==\n* {{cite book |first=Hans-Joachim |last=B\u00f6ttcher |title=Elisabeth von Sachsen und Johann Kasimir von der Pfalz: Ein Ehe- und Religionskonflikt |trans-title=Elisabeth of Saxony and John Casimir of the Palatinate: A Marital and Religious Conflict |publisher=Dresdner Buchverlag |location=Dresden |date=2018 |isbn=9783946906063 |language=de}}\n\n== Ancestors ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n| 1= 1.

His support of Calvinism gave the German Reformed movement a foothold within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\n==Life==\n[[Image:Frederick III, Elector Palatine.jpg|thumb|right|Frederick III and his wives, Marie of Brandenburg and Amalia of Neuenahr]]\nFrederick was strictly educated in the Roman faith at his father's court and at [[Cologne]], but, influenced by his wife, the pious princess [[Marie of Brandenburg-Kulmbach|Maria of Brandenburg]], whom he married in 1537, he followed the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and in 1546 made a public profession of his faith. He succeeded his father John II as duke of [[Simmern]] on 18 May 1557, and became elector on 12 February 1559, on the death of Otto Henry. Under his predecessor [[Gnesio-Lutherans|strict Lutherans]] like [[Tilemann Heshusius]], [[Melanchthonians]], and [[Calvinists]] had found a place in the Palatinate. In the summer of 1559 bitter controversies arose among them. Theses on the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] prepared by the [[Heidelberg]] deacon Wilhelm Klebitz provoked a bitter controversy between him and Heshusius.\n\nWhen efforts at mediation failed Frederick deposed both men on 16 September 1559. To get a clear understanding of the controversy Frederick spent days and nights in theological studies and was thus led more and more to the Reformed confession. A disputation held in June 1560 between the Saxon theologians [[Johann St\u00f6ssel]] and [[Joachim M\u00f6rlin]] and the Heidelbergers [[Pierre Boquin]], [[Thomas Erastus]], and Paul Einhorn increased Frederick's dislike for the Lutheran zealots. After the [[Naumburg Convention]] (January, 1561) Frederick fully adopted the Reformed dogmas.\n\nIn March 1561 he invited [[Emmanuel Tremellius]] to Heidelberg, and in September the famous [[Zacharius Ursinus]]. The whole Church was now transformed. [[Caspar Olevianus]] had been there since January 1560. Images of the saints, [[vestments]], baptismal fonts, and other \"idolatrous works,\" even organs, were ruthlessly removed from the churches. In the celebration of the Lord's Supper the breaking of bread was introduced. The revenues from monasteries and foundations were confiscated and applied to Evangelical church purposes or charity. The [[Heidelberg Catechism]], prepared by a committee of theologians and ministers likely led by Ursinus, now served as the norm of doctrine and for the instruction of the youth.\n\nThe church order of 15 November 1563 and the [[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistory]] order of 1564 consolidated the changes. The opposition of ministers inclining to Lutheranism was suppressed by their dismissal. Among the Lutherans, Frederick's measures caused a great sensation. The religious colloquy held at [[Maulbronn]] in April 1564 increased the animosity. In 1565 the [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian]] ordered the changes to be annulled. A unanimous decree of the 1566 [[Diet of Augsburg]] also demanded the abolition of the changes. Frederick, however, declared in the 14 May session of the Diet that a matter was concerned over which God alone has the rule, and if it was intended to proceed against him, he would find comfort in the promises of his Saviour. The decree was not carried out.\n\nAfter completing the work of reform in the [[Rhine Palatinate]], Frederick endeavored to continue it in the [[Upper Palatinate]]; but here he was resisted by the zealous Lutheran estates. He continued his work of reform on the Rhine by introducing in 1570 a strict church discipline. Frederick pronounced the sentence of death on the Antitrinitarian [[Johann Sylvan]] based on the opinion signed by Olevianus, Ursinus, and Boquin, on 23 December 1572.\n\nIn 1562 Frederick gave [[Frankenthal]] as a refuge to the Evangelicals driven from the [[Netherlands]]. He sent his like-minded son [[Johann Casimir]] in 1567 and again in 1576 to [[France]] in aid of the [[Huguenots]]. In 1569 he assisted also the Count Palatine [[Wolfgang of Pfalz-Zweibr\u00fccken]] on his way to France. \n\nFrederick's last years were troubled by domestic afflictions. As his older son Louis was a strict Lutheran, he could not hope that after his death his work would be carried out in his own spirit.\n\n==Family and children==\nFrederick III was married twice. Firstly, he married in 1537  [[Marie of Brandenburg-Kulmbach]] (1519 &ndash; 1567), daughter of [[Casimir, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth]] and [[Susanna of Bavaria]]. Their children were:\n# Alberta (4 April 1538 &ndash; 19 March 1553)\n# [[Louis VI, Elector Palatine]] (4 July 1539 &ndash; 22 October 1583)\n# [[Countess Palatine Elisabeth of Simmern-Sponheim|Elisabeth]] (30 June 1540 &ndash; 8 February 1594), married in 1558 to Duke [[Johann Frederick II, Duke of Saxony|Johann Frederick II of Saxony]]\n# Hermann Ludwig (6 October 1541 &ndash; 1 July 1556)\n# [[Johann Casimir of Simmern|Johann Casimir]] (7 March 1543 &ndash; 16 January 1592); married: 1570 [[Elisabeth of Saxony]] (18 October 1552 - 2 April 1590)\n# [[Dorothea Susanne of Simmern|Dorothea Susanne]] (15 November 1544] &ndash; 8 April 1592), married in 1560 to [[John William, Duke of Saxe-Weimar]]\n# Albert (30 September 1546 &ndash; 30 April 1547)\n# Anna Elisabeth (23 July 1549 &ndash; 20 September 1609), married:\n## in 1569 to Landgrave [[Philipp II of Hesse-Rheinfels]];\n## in 1599 to Count Palatine [[John Augustus, Count Palatine of L\u00fctzelstein|John August of Veldenz]]\n# Christof (13 June 1551 &ndash; 14 April 1574)\n# Karl (28 December 1552 &ndash; 12 September 1555)\n# Kunigunde Jakob\u00e4a (9 October 1556 &ndash; 26 January 1586), married in 1580 to Count [[John VI of Nassau-Dillenburg]]\n\nSecondly, he married in 1569 [[Amalia of Neuenahr]] ( 1539 &ndash; 1602), but this marriage was childless.\n\nHe died in 1576, and was succeeded as Elector Palatine by his son [[Louis VI, Elector Palatine|Louis VI]]. Frederick had carved out a territory from the Lower Palatine land dubbed \"Pfalz-Lautern\" for his second surviving son [[Johann Casimir]] as an enclave to enable the continued existence of the Reformed faith. Johann Casimir would serve as regent for the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] upon Louis VI's death and would oversee the return of the Reformed faith to the Palatinate.\n\n== Literature ==\n* {{cite book |first=Hans-Joachim |last=B\u00f6ttcher |title=Elisabeth von Sachsen und Johann Kasimir von der Pfalz: Ein Ehe- und Religionskonflikt |trans-title=Elisabeth of Saxony and John Casimir of the Palatinate: A Marital and Religious Conflict |publisher=Dresdner Buchverlag |location=Dresden |date=2018 |isbn=9783946906063 |language=de}}\n\n== Ancestors ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n| 1= 1.
