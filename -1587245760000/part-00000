There were few alterations and adjustments made as the army grew from a limited peacetime defense force of 100,000 men to a war-fighting force of several million men.\n\nThese ranks and insignia were specific to the Heer and in special cases to senior Wehrmacht officers in the independent services; the uniforms and rank systems of the other branches of the ''Wehrmacht'', the [[Ranks and insignia of the Luftwaffe (1935\u20131945)|''Luftwaffe'']] (Air Force) and [[Uniforms and insignia of the Kriegsmarine|''Kriegsmarine'']] (Navy), were different, as were those of the [[uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|SS]] which was a Party organization outside the ''Wehrmacht.'' The [[Nazi Party]] also had its own series of [[Nazi Germany paramilitary ranks|paramilitary uniforms and insignia]].\n\n==Insignia==\n\n===National Emblem (breast eagle): ''Hoheitszeichen'' or ''Wehrmachtsadler''===\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal \n| align     = right\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Wehrmachtsadler\n| image1    = Wehrmachtsadler-1935.svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Wehrmachtsadler-1939.svg\n| caption2  = 1939\n| image3    = Wehrmachtsadler-1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Wehrmachtsadler-1944.svg\n| caption4  = 1944\n| image5    = Wehrmachtsadler-Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\nThe ''[[Reichswehr]]'s'' visual acknowledgement of the new [[Nazi Party|National Socialist]] reality came on 17 February 1934, when the Commander-in-Chief, [[Werner von Blomberg]], ordered the Nazi Party eagle-and-swastika, now [[Germany]]'s National Emblem, to be worn on uniform blouses and headgear effective 1 May.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=312}} The design adopted, in silver for the ''Reichsheer'' (army) and in gold for the ''Reichsmarine'' (navy), was a stylized eagle with outstretched, beveled wings clutching a wreathed mobile ''Hakenkreuz'', later to be called the ''Wehrmachtsadler'' (\"armed forces eagle\").{{efn|The ''Luftwaffe'', although a branch of the ''Wehrmacht'', would use its own eagle design.}} On tunics this took the form of a cloth patch about 9&nbsp;cm (3\u215d\") wide worn on the right breast, above the pocket. For enlisted uniforms it was jacquard-woven (\"BeVo\") or sometimes machine-embroidered in silver-grey rayon, for officers machine- or hand-embroidered in white silk or bright aluminum wire, and for generals hand-embroidered in gold bullion.{{efn|\"Gold bullion\" in this context does not (usually) refer to actual gold, but to gold-colored wire, typically a bronze alloy}} The backing was \"badge-cloth\" (''Abzeichentuch''), a close-woven velvetish fabric; this was originally ''Reichsheer'' grey, but in late 1935 the renamed ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht Heer]]'' changed its ''Abzeichentuch'' color to a dark blue-green called ''flaschengr\u00fcn'' (bottle-green).\n\nThe war brought several variations to the breast eagle, although it should be kept in mind that none of them was replaced or de-authorized, and all were being worn side by side at war's end. When hostilities began in 1939, on the enlisted ''Feldbluse'' or [[World War II German uniform#Field Tunic (Feldbluse) Model 1936|field blouse]] the eagle was changed from silver-white to matte grey for reduced visibility; and in 1940 backings began to be produced in field-grey (''feldgrau''). Another version appeared with the advent of the [[World War II German uniform#Field Blouse Model 1944|Model 1944 Field Blouse]], which used a triangular backing for speed and simplicity of manufacture. Very late in the war some ''Hoheitszeichen'' were simply printed on thin fabric.\n\nThere were also versions for other uniforms: both white and grey variants on black for the [[World War II German uniform#Panzer uniform (Sonderbekleidung der Panzertruppen)|Panzer uniform]], and in dull grey-blue on tan backing for the [[World War II German uniform#Tropical uniform|tropical]] (''[[Afrikakorps]]'') uniform.

By the middle of World War I these ornate collars had been reduced to an embroidered representation of short lengths of braid joined at the ends, sewn to patches worn at the front of the collar. When the ''Reichsheer'' was established in 1921 as Germany's first national army{{efn|The German Army of Imperial times comprised in wartime the armies of the Kingdoms of Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria and W\u00fcrttemberg under the Prussian General Staff (''Generalstab'').}} ''Litzen'' were prescribed as the universal collar device for all personnel other than generals, and the Third Reich continued the practice.\n\nHowever, for clarification it has to be distinguished between \"collar patch\" ({{lang-de|Kragenpatte or Kragenspiegel}}), and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] braid (Unteroffizierslitze or Kragenlitze) \u2013 the status symbol of all German NCO ranks \u2013 encircling the collar of the uniform tunic. An NCO wore both, collar patches, and the collar encircling braid. [[Commissioned officer]]s wore only collar patches.\n\n==== Design and versions ====\n{{main|Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)}}\nOn both collar points of any uniform jacket there was a collar patch. Each patch consisted of the padding, and two parallel facings ({{lang-de|Patten}}), the so-called ''Litzenspiegel'', symbolising the double braid of the 19th century.\n\nThe padding of full-dress collar patches showed the wearer's ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'' (corps color). The dress tunic version was embroidered in fine aluminum thread on a patch of ''badge cloth'' ({{lang-de|Abzeichentuch}}). The backing also showed through in the space between the two parallel facings of the collar patch, and formed so a colour center stripe.\n\nOn field \u2013 and service uniforms, beginning in late 1935, the collar patch was dark bottle-green to match the collar; the ''Waffenfarbe'' \"showed through\" (in fact colored cord was sewn into) the center strip of each braid, the ''Litzenspiegel.''\n\nFor enlisted men, service ''collar patches'' were machine-woven in silver-grey rayon; COs' were embroidered more elaborately in white silk or aluminium thread, and were somewhat larger to match their higher collars.\n\nNCOs ({{lang-de|Unteroffiziere}}) wore standard enlisted collar patches but were distinguished by a strip of 9mm silver-grey diamond-woven rayon braid (Unteroffoziers-Tressen, NCO-Tressen), sewn around the collar, except on the dress, where the NCO-Tresse was bright aluminum. However, the aluminum-embroidered NCO-Tressen on dress uniforms ({{lang-de|Ausgangsuniform, Paradeuniform}}) encircled the collar's upper edge, the simpler NCO-Tressen on service \u2013 or field uniform encircled the collar's lower edge.{{Clear}}\n\n====Universal design from 1938====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted versions\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen Dress.svg\n| caption1  = <center>Dress</center>\n| image2    = Mannschaft Litzen 1938.svg\n| caption2  = <center>Field, 1938</center>\n| image3    = Mannschaft Litzen 1940.svg\n| caption3  = <center>Field, 1940</center>\n}}\n\n[[File:Feldgendarmerie.JPG|thumb|right|120px|Field tunic with collar patches, NCO-Tressen and [[Gorget]], post 1940.]]\n\nBy 1938 the fast-growing ''Heer'' had found that it was impractical, for the enlisted field uniform, to manufacture and stock a multitude of collar patches in assorted ''Waffenfarben'' which also had to be sewn on and frequently changed by unit tailors. Accordingly, new universal collar patches were introduced with the ''Litzenspiegel'' and ''Mittelstreifen''{{Explain|date=March 2018}} woven in dark green to match the backing patch, and which could be applied at the factory; ''Waffenfarbe'' was now displayed on the shoulder-straps, which simply buttoned on and were easily switched.\n\nWith the wartime change to lower-visibility insignia enlisted collar patches were woven in matte \"mouse-grey\" with field-grey stripes, which were at first sewn to green collar patches as before but increasingly directly to the collar, which beginning in 1940 was made in ''feldgrau'' like the uniform; grey collar patches were never produced. The troops however preferred the green patches (and collars) if they had or could get them, especially on \"clean\" uniforms for walking-out; and long-service veterans took particular pride in pre-38 versions.\n\nIn contrast, officers' service uniform collar patches never changed. While most officers in the front lines wore the enlisted field uniform as per wartime regulations, many opted to have their green-and-silver collar patches added instead of (or on top of) the factory versions. \n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen Trop.svg\n| caption1  = <center><small>field & service</small></center>\n| header    = Enlisted versions, tropic\n}}\n\nOn olive tropical uniforms the collar patches were tan with dull grey-blue ''Litzenspiegel'' for all personnel; officers again sometimes added their green collar patches. Tropical NCO collar ''Tressen'' were copper-brown, or sometimes olive drab.{{Clear}}\n\n====Armored vehicle uniforms====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| width     = 45\n| header    = [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFV]] crew collar insignia\n| image1    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten mit Totenkopf.jpg\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten mit Litzen.jpg\n| caption2  =\n| image3    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten ohne Abzeichen.jpg\n| footer    = <center><small>[[Waffenfarbe]] (assault artillery)</small></center>\n| footer_background = red\n}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     =\n| image3    = Panzer Totenkopf.jpg\n| caption3  = <center><small>Death's-head</small></center>\n| width3    = 60\n| image1    = Panzersonderbekleidung Kragenpatten.jpg\n| caption1  = <center><small>collar patch</small></center>\n| width1    = 40\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption2  = <center><small>shoulder strap</small></center>\n| width2    = 120\n| header    = rank insignias armored troops\n| footer    = <center><small>[[Waffenfarbe]] (armored corps)</small></center>\n| footer_background = #FF99CC\n}}\n\nA major exception to the wearing of ''Litzen'' was the \"panzer wrap\" ({{lang-de|Panzerjacke}}), the double-breasted jacket worn by crews of tanks and other armored vehicles. When the ''[[Panzertruppe]]'' were established in 1935 they were issued a [[World War II German uniform#Panzer uniform|distinctive black uniform]] and as a badge the ''Totenkopf'' or Death's-head, versions of which had formerly been worn by the Imperial tank corps and [[Media:AugustvonMackensen.jpg|various cavalry units]]. These skulls took the form of white-metal pins attached to black ''Kragenpatten'' which were edged in ''Waffenfarbe'' piping.\n\nIn mid-1940 crews of assault guns (''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]en'') received a uniform of their own, identical in cut to the ''Panzerjacke'' but in standard field-grey, which they wore with red artillery piping. Over the course of the war a bewildering and changing series of regulations governed the uniforms and insignia for assault guns, tank destroyers, armored cars and self-propelled guns (SPG). Depending on the unit and the date either the black or grey wrap or the standard ''Feldbluse'' might be authorized, and on the grey \"assault gun\" jacket the regulation collar patches could be black with skulls, or grey with skulls, ''Litzen'', or no device at all. The result in practice was chaos; wartime photos show a mix of uniforms and insignia worn not only in the same battalion, but even in the same vehicle.\n\nOfficially both colours of panzer wrap were working and field uniforms to be worn only in or around the vehicle; this regulation was universally ignored. ''Panzertruppen'' were issued standard uniforms for service-dress and walking out but rarely wore them, much preferring their unique jackets.\n\nIn North Africa, [[Armored fighting vehicle|AFV crews]] wore the same tropical uniform as the other branches, including collar patches; many tankers however pinned their ''Totenkopf'' badges to their lapels.{{Clear}}\n\n====Infanterie Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"====\n[[File:Special Single Litzen for NCO ranks of Gro\u00dfdeutschland IR.jpg|thumb|left|200px|NCOs' collar patch and ''Tressen'' of I.R. \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"]]\n\nIn June 1939, the Wehrmacht Heer wanted to renew its ties with the Old Army tradition by introducing a new uniform for its most prestigious unit: ''Wachregiment \"Berlin\"'' which was renamed [[Infantry Regiment Gro\u00dfdeutschland|Infantry Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"]]. The new dress uniform for I.R. \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\" had an elongated collar patch with single ''Litzenspiegel'' for NCOs and two for enlisted. Although shown to the press, this new uniform was not provided to the unit due to the outbreak of World War II and was placed in depot storage.{{Clear}}\n\n==== General Staff Corps Officers ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-130-51, Rudolf-Christoph v.

They ranked from ''Hauptmann im Generalstab'' (captain) through ''Oberst i.G.'' (colonel). All were, before 1939, graduates of the Military Academy, the ''[[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]]''. On division staffs they held the position of '''Ia''' (operational chief of staff) or '''Ib''' (chief of the rear echelon). In the higher echelons, the intelligence and training staff sections were most of the time in the personal charge of General Staff Corps officers. The General Staff Officers had their own distinctive Litzen called ''alt-Preu\u00dfische'' (old Prussian), or ''Kolbenstickerei'' (\"lobe-embroidery\"). These were the same whether on carmine dress ''Kragenpatten'' or green service patches; colored ''Litzenspiegel'' were unnecessary. General Staff officers assigned to the supreme headquarters (the ''Reichskriegsministerium'', later the [[OKH]] and the [[OKW]]), the Kriegsakademie, and military attaches were further distinguished by having their Litzen in gold rather than silver. These Generalstaboffiziere were called \"des Generalstabs\", Oberst d.G., etc. The special golden Litzen were abolished in November 1942. Only Military attaches kept their Litzen as long as they were in their present position. The F\u00fchrer wanted a closer union between the front and the OKW and OKH.\n\nIn addition to their collar patches, General Staff Officers wore trouser-stripes, of the same design as generals' but in carmine rather than scarlet.\n\n====Generals====\n[[File:WMacht arabesques OF10toOF6-hor 1945.jpg|left|120px]]\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0408-503, Walter v.

These devices, sometimes called ''Arabesken'' (arabesques), were embroidered in gold bullion or golden synthetic ''Celleon'' on ''Hochrot'' (scarlet) backing.\nField Marshals wore the same ''Arabesken'' as generals until April 1941, when they were authorized a longer variant with three rather than two iterations of the repeating pattern, for a total of six \"prongs\".{{sfn|Rosignoli|1975|p=209}} In some cases GFM did not bother to replace their generals' tabs, or did so only on their dress uniforms.\n\nGeneral officers of the Special Troop Service (''Truppensonderdienst'' \u2013 TDS) and of the specialist careers (medical, veterinary, ordnance, and motor park) wore the same insignia until April 1944, when they were ordered to exchange their scarlet ''Kragenpatten'' for ''alt-Larisch'' tabs backed in their respective ''[[Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)|Waffenfarbe:]]''\n\n* {{Farbindex|93CCEA|bright blue}} \u2013 TDS administrative;\n* {{Farbindex|6495ED|cornflower blue}} \u2013 medical;\n* {{Farbindex|FF7538|orange}} \u2013 ordnance;{{efn|Before June 1944 their Waffenfarbe was bright red.}}\n* {{Farbindex|FFC0CB|pink}} \u2013 motor park;\n* {{Farbindex|960018|carmine}} \u2013 veterinary;\n* {{Farbindex|900020|wine red}} \u2013 TDS judiciary.\n\nIn October 1944, the wear-out period of the scarlet backing color for Generals of the specialist careers was extended for an undetermined period.\n\nThese [[Gorget patches|arabesque collar patches]] are still worn today by general officers of the present-day [[Bundeswehr]].\n\n=====Chief=====\n[[File:VonRundstedt-Shoulderboards-alt-Larisch.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Gorget patch|Kragenpatte]] & [[Epaulette]] of von Rundstedt]]\nIn the Wehrmacht Heer, upon retirement, certain senior German generals were awarded the honorary post of ''Chef'' (Chief) of a regiment, much like the [[Honorary Colonel]] in the British Army. It was a German custom dating from the late 18th century.  These generals were authorized to wear the tunic and insignia of an officer of the regiment, including ordinary officers' ''Litzen.'' Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], ''Chef'' of the {{ill|18th Infantry Regiment (Germany)|lt=18th Infantry Regiment|de|18. Infanterie-Regiment (Reichswehr)}}, wore a big 18 on his shoulderboards, and for everyday wear favored the ornamented tunic of an infantry officer with white piping rather than a general's uniform.\n\nHitler appointed first Generaloberst [[Hans von Seeckt]], ancient \"Chef der Heeresleitung\", to be Chef of the 67th Infanterie Regiment on his 70th birthday in April 1936, a few months before he died. Only seven German generals were appointed Chefs: in addition to Seeckt and Rundstedt they were General der Infanterie [[Franz Ritter von Epp|Ritter von Epp]] (Chef of the 61st Infanterie Regiment in Munich); Generalfeldmarschall [[August von Mackensen|von Mackensen]] (Chef of the 5th Kavallerie Regiment in [[Stolp]]); Generaloberst [[Werner von Fritsch|von Fritsch]] (Chef of the 12th Artillerie Regiment in Schwerin); and Generalfeldmarschall [[Eduard von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli|von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli]] (Chef of the 28th Infanterie Regiment in [[Troppau]]). Generalfeldmarschall [[von Blomberg]] was appointed Chef of Infanterie Regiment 73 and wore a big 73 superimposed over the crossed batons of his shoulder board, but on 4 February 1938 he was dismissed and his name was deleted from the seniority list.\n\n===Shoulder-straps (''Schulterklappen'') and shoulderboards (''Schulterst\u00fccke'')===\n\n====Enlisted men====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 80\n| image1    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1936).svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1938-1940) vertical.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaften Epaulette 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption4  = Panzer\n| image5    = Mannschaften Epaulette Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n\n}}\n\nThe ''Reichsheer's'' shoulder-straps were very similar to those of World War I, made of ''feldgrau'' uniform cloth with pointed or \"gable\" button ends. In December 1934 the material was changed to grey badge-cloth (''Abzeichentuch'') and in September 1935 changed again to dark bottle-green (''flaschengr\u00fcn''). These \"first pattern\" shoulder-straps were not edged in ''Waffenfarbe'' piping.\n\nIn 1938, simultaneous with the removal of ''Waffenfarbe'' from field-uniform collar patches, new shoulder-straps were issued. These \"second pattern\" straps had round rather than pointed ends, and were edged on three sides with wool (later rayon) piping in ''Waffenfarbe.''  This pattern would be used through the end of the war, although in 1940 manufacture reverted to field-grey uniform cloth, and as usual alternate versions were made to go with the Panzer uniform (black), tropical uniform (olive cotton) and [[World War II German uniform#HBT fatigue and summer uniforms (Drillichanzug/Sommerfeldanzug)|HBT summer uniform]] (reed-green twill). ''Schulterklappen'' were not worn with the fatigue uniform, nor with camouflage smocks and parkas which used an [[Ranks and Insignia of the German Army in World War II#Smock/parka rank insignia|alternate system of rank insignia]].\n\nFor junior enlisted men (''Mannschaften''), rank insignia if any was worn on the left sleeve. However the epaulettes did indicate the wearer's unit (usually regiment or independent battalion) together with his sub-branch if any, machine-embroidered in branch-color. For example, a ''Schulterklappe'' with rose-pink piping and number \"4\" would indicate the 4th Panzer Regiment; but if it carried a pink number \"4\" and letter \"A\" it would indicate the 4th Armored Reconnaissance (''Aufkl\u00e4rungs'') Battalion. The German Army used a very large assortment of Latin initials, Gothic initials, script ciphers, Arabic numerals, Roman numerals and symbols to designate all its various service branches and installations. Before the war, shoulder-buttons were embossed with the number of the wearer's company as well, this practice was discontinued \"for the duration.\"\n[[File:Trop Oberwachtmeister epaulette.jpg|thumb|right|80px|Cavalry ''Oberwachtmeister'', tropical]]\nBeginning in January 1940, shoulder-straps with unit insignia were (supposed to be) phased out as a security measure, and removable fabric loops with devices were issued instead. In May 1944 the embroidery was changed from ''waffenfarbe'' to light gray.\n\nNon-commissioned officers wore their rank insignia on their shoulder-straps, consisting of braid and pips (pyramidal \"stars\"). An ''Unteroffizier's'' (corporal's) epaulette was edged with ''Tresse'' on three sides and an ''Unterfeldwebel's'' (sergeant's) on all four. Senior NCO's (''Unteroffiziere mit Portepee'') added one to three pips; in addition, their unit identifiers took the form of white-metal pins rather than embroidery.\n\nShoulder-straps were made in both a standard width (4.5&nbsp;cm, 1\u00be\") and a wider one for three-digit unit numbers (5.3&nbsp;cm, 2\"), and in three lengths depending on the size of the man. There was in addition an extra-large size for the overcoat (''Mantel'').\n\n====Officers====\n\n[[File:Hauptmann Epaulette.jpg|thumb|left|90px]]\nOfficers' shoulderboards were constructed from \"Russia\" braid, an aluminum-thread double piping. Company-grade officers (''Leutnant'' through ''Hauptmann/Rittmeister'') wore epaulettes constructed by wrapping two side-by-side lengths of braid around the buttonhole and back, giving the appearance of eight parallel cords; the whole was sewn to an underlay (''Unterlagen'') of ''Waffenfarbe'' badge-cloth. Until 1938 the underlay was of the same outer dimensions as the braid, and only visible edge-on; in that year the underlay was made wider, so as to create the impression of edge piping like the enlisted shoulder-strap. Rank was indicated by zero to two gilt-metal pips; unit designators were also of gilt metal.\n[[File:Major Epaulette.jpg|thumb|right|95px]]\nField-grade officer (''Stabsoffizier'') shoulderboards were made by plaiting together double widths of Russia braid and looping them to form a buttonhole, sewn to a ''Waffenfarbe'' underlay; rank again was displayed by zero to two gilt pips.\n\nOnce the war began, dull grey aluminum braid appeared, but bright aluminum continued in use.\n\n====Generals====\n[[File:Wehrmacht Generalsrangabzeichen.jpg|thumb|300px|Generals' shoulderboards, Wehrmacht (Heer)]]\n*'''1''' [[Generalfeldmarschall]] ([[OF-10]], [[five-star rank]], shoulder strap from April 1941)\n*'''2''' [[Generalfeldmarschall]] (OF-10, five-star rank, shoulder strap prior to April 1941)\n*'''3''' [[Generaloberst]] (OF-9, [[four-star rank]])\n*'''4''' [[General of the branch]] (OF-8, [[three-star rank]])\n*'''5''' [[Generalleutnant]] (OF-7, [[two-star rank]])\n*'''6''' [[Generalmajor]] (OF-6, [[one-star rank]])\n\nGenerals' shoulderboards were constructed similarly to those of field-grade officers, but comprised a length of silver Russia braid between two braided cords of gold bullion or ''Celleon.'' Since the resulting combination was wider, generals' boards were plaited in four 'loops' rather than five. Their buttons were gilt, and rank was indicated by zero to three silver pips, or crossed batons in the case of field marshals. The underlay was scarlet, except (from 1944) for generals of staff corps, who were instructed to wear ''Waffenfarbe'' instead.\n\nIn April 1941, ''Generalfeldmarschall'' epaulettes were changed to incorporate a central gold cord instead of silver.\n\nColonels-in-chief wearing that uniform wore gold generals' shoulderboards underlaid with the ''Waffenfarbe'' of the regiment rather than scarlet; GFM von Rundstedt sometimes simply pinned his crossed batons to an infantry colonel's epaulettes.\n\n====Retired personnel====\n[[File:Wehrmacht Generalmajor (a.D.).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Generalmajor a.D.]]\nBy order of Marshal Hindenburg in March 1932, soldiers who retired after 15 years of service received the right to wear the uniform of the unit they left. The shoulderboards and shoulder straps of retired soldiers had a bridle 1.5&nbsp;cm wide attached under the middle.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[File:Schirmmutze cap badges.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Eagle/swastika and wreathed cockade used on the peaked cap (Schirmm\u00fctze).]] [[File:Insignias casco.svg|thumb|Decals of Heer used on various helmets.]]\nCaps and helmets bore two common insignia elements, in various forms: the [[Coat of arms of Germany#Nazi Germany|National Emblem]] and the national colors. World War I caps had carried dual [[cockades]] or roundels, one in Imperial black-white-red and one in the colors of the particular State within the Empire. The ''[[Reichswehr]]'' changed this to a single cockade in the Weimar Republic's black, red and gold; almost as soon as Hitler took power he restored the [[Flag of Germany#North German Confederation and the German Empire (1866\u20131918)|pre-1919 tricolor flag]], and ordered the Army to return to black-white-red.\n\n===Belt buckles (''Koppelschl\u00f6sser'')===\n[[File:Koppelschloss Wehrmacht.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Enlisted ''Koppelschlo\u00df'']]\nBelt buckles for enlisted men were of box type, made of aluminum or stamped steel and bearing a circular device with a version of the ''Hoheitszeichen'' called the Army eagle or ''Heeresadler'' (an eagle with downswept wings clutching an unwreathed swastika) surmounted by the motto ''[[Gott mit uns]]'', or \"God with us.\" For field wear these were usually painted field-grey to reduce visibility and had a smooth finish; on the other hand, dress buckles were silver-washed with a pebbled surface surrounding the Hoheitszeichen.\n\nOfficers' field and service buckles were of a two-pronged frame type. With dress uniform officers wore a belt of silver braid with a circular silver-washed or -plated aluminum buckle, in the form of an oakleaf wreath surrounding a ''Heeresadler.'' Generals' were the same but gilt or gold-plated.\n\nWith the tropical uniform and its belt of cotton webbing, officers wore a buckle identical to the dress buckle but painted olive-drab.\n\n==Ranks and rank insignia==\n\n===Rank tables===\n\n====Enlisted personnel (''Mannschaften'')====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted collar ''Litzen''\n| footer    = Red ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'': artillery\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen 1934.svg\n| alt1      = Mannschaft Litzen 1935\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaft Litzen 1938.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaft Litzen 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaft Litzen Dress.svg\n| caption4  = Dress\n| image5    = Mannschaft Litzen Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted ''Schulterklappen''\n| footer    = White ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'': infantry, rose pink: armor\n| image1    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1936).svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1938-1940) vertical.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaften Epaulette 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption4  = Panzer uniform\n| image5    = Mannschaften Epaulette Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He was therefore roughly analogous to a Company Sergeant-Major or First Sergeant, although his duties did not usually involve combat leadership. ''Der Spie\u00df''{{efn|\"The spear.\" This may refer to the sergeant of a flintlock-era company having carried a [[polearm]] rather than a musket, or it may relate to Latin ''pilus prior'' \"leading spear,\" the senior centurion in a cohort.}} or ''die Kompanie-Mutter'', as he was called, was not necessarily the ranking ''Unteroffizier'' in the company, especially since typically two of the platoons were commanded by senior NCOs rather than officers. A ''Hauptfeldwebel'' however had to be \nof ''Portepee'' grade; a junior NCO filling the role was a ''Hauptfeldwebeldiensttuer,'' \"one doing ''Hauptfeldwebel'' duties.\"\n\nThe insignia for a ''Hauptfeldwebel'' was a pair of NCO ''Tressen'' encircling each lower sleeve, nicknamed \"piston rings;\" he also carried a leather ''Meldetasche'' or report-case tucked into his tunic front.\n\n====Senior non-commissioned specialist officers====\nIn two specialist career paths it was possible to attain rank above ''Stabsfeldwebel'': fortifications engineers (''Festungspioniere'') and farriers (''Hufbeschlagschmieder'').{{efn|Farriers, blacksmiths specializing in the shoeing and care of horses, were a very important component of the WWII German army, 70\u201380% of which depended on horse-drawn transport.

They consist of civil service personnel performing functions within the Armed Forces and are recruited, in part, from former professional non-commissioned officers who became military candidates for civil service ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4ranw\u00e4rter}}) at the end of their 12-year contractual period of active military service.\n\nUp to 1944, none of these officials were classified as soldiers; in that year certain groups were converted into officers in the Special Troop Service (''Truppensonderdienst'' or TSD). These were the higher administrative officers (''Intendanten'') in ranks from captain to lieutenant general; the lower administrative officers (''Zahlmeister'') in the ranks of first and second lieutenant, and the judge advocates (''Richter'') in ranks from captain to lieutenant general. At this time all personnel of the Field Post Office were made soldiers as well, but formed a corps of their own rather than belonging to the TSD. It was also made possible for qualified reserve technical service officials to become reserve officers of the motor maintenance troops.\n\nThe officials had titles, not ranks: ''Intendant, Direktor, Rat, Vorsteher, Inspektor, Meister, Assistent''. This is a complex subject as each branch had its own titles.\n\n=== Military officials ===\n==== Shoulderboards ====\n{{main|Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)#Corps colours of the Heeresverwaltung}}\nWith certain exceptions, military officials ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4r-Beamte}}) wore shoulderboards similar to those of soldiers of equivalent rank, but distinguished by the addition of dark green elements: those equivalent to generals had a central cord in their braided shoulderboards which incorporated green chevrons, and those equivalent to officers wore a narrow green stripe between the rows of braid. WO-equivalent ''officials'' wore a complex braided shoulderboard made of green, black and silver cords. In nearly all cases the shoulderboard underlay was a double layer of dark green under ''Nebenfarbe'', and metal pins with the '''HV''' (German abbreviation of ''Heeresverwaltung'', \"Army Administration\") cipher were worn.\n\nCertain services had insignia of their own: for example the ''Feldpost'' (\"Field Post Office\") wore shoulderboards with gold rather than green elements and the initials '''FP'''; and musical officials wore silver-and-red shoulderboards with a lyre insignia. ''Beamten'' in the employ of a military administration authority in the occupied territories wore '''MV''' (German abbreviation of ''Milit\u00e4rverwaltung'', \"Military Administration\") pins rather than '''HV''' ciphers.\n\nMost officials wore in addition to their dark green Waffenfarbe a secondary colour (''Nebenfarbe'') denoting their branch:\n\nIn March 1940 distinct ''Nebenfarben'' were abolished and replaced with light grey.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = \n| image1   = \n| caption1  = <center><small>[[General officer]] ranks ('''1''' to '''3''') and [[Officer rank]]s ('''4''' to '''6''')</small></center>\n| width1     = 400\n| image2   =\n| caption2  = <center><small>Officer ranks ('''7''' to '''9'''), and [[Warrant officer]] ranks ('''10-11'''1)</small></center>\n| width2     = 345\n| header    = Rank insignias to officials of the Milit\u00e4rverwaltung (MV)\n| footer    = <center>Shoulder straps </center>\n| footer_background = \n}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = \n| caption1  = <center><small>[[General officer]] ranks ('''1-2'''), [[Officer rank]]s ('''3''' to '''7'''), and [[Warrant officer]] ranks ('''8-9''')</small></center>\n| width1     = 600\n| header    = File 2: Rank insignias to officials on the \"Reich\u00b4s court-martial\" <small>([[Reichskriegsgericht]])</small>\n| footer    = <center>Shoulder straps 1935 until 1945</center>\n| footer_background = \n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Collar patches ====\n''Heeresbeamten'' wore distinctive collar patches; these tabs indicated not the official's rank or title, but rather the \"grade\" of the service in which the official was employed. These were classified by the minimum educational requirement, and ranged from ''Einfacher Dienst'' (Basic Services), for which a grade-school education was sufficient, through ''Mitteler'' (Middle) and ''Gehobener'' (Elevated) ''Dienst'', to ''H\u00f6herer Dienst'' (Higher Services) which required a university degree.\n\nOfficials in the Basic Services wore collar patches similar to (but larger than) enlisted soldiers', grey ''Litzen'' on dark green ''Patten'', but the patch was piped on three sides in ''Nebenfarbe''; similarly officials in the Middle and Elevated services wore officer-pattern ''Litzen'', again with ''Nebenfarbe''-piped patches. Officials of the Higher Services wore unique ''Kragenpatten'' with ''alt-Preussische Litzen'' in gold like ''Offiziere des Generalstabs'', but on dark green with, again, ''Nebenfarbe'' piping. General officer-equivalents wore green patches with generals' arabesques, similarly bordered.\n\n=== ''Beamter auf Kriegsdauer'' ===\nIn addition to the career ''Beamten'', wartime needs led to the creation of \"Officials for the duration of the war,\" or ''Beamter auf Kriegsdauer''. These men had needed skills but either did not possess all the qualifications to become full-fledged ''Beamten,'' or were effectively drafted from civilian jobs. The matter was further confused by the fact that Beamter a. K. did the same jobs and held the same titles as career officials.\n\nNonetheless, Beamter a. K. wore entirely distinct collar patches. The backing patch was large and piped on three sides like that worn by career ''Beamten'', but was light grey edged in green. The device was a rectangle pointed at the upper end with braid down the center, much like a British general's [[gorget patch]], the colors indicating the degree of the ''Beamter's'' service: grey with green braid for basic services, silver with green braid for middle and elevated services, and gold on gold for higher services.\n\n=== Military Supreme Court officials (''Wehrmachtbeamte beim Reichskriegsgericht'') ===\nOfficials of the Wehrmacht who worked in Military Supreme Courts wore shoulder straps without the \"HV\" and had the secondary colour of Bordeaux red (''Bordorot'').\n\n=== ''Sonderf\u00fchrer'' ===\n{{Main|Sonderf\u00fchrer}}\n''Sonderf\u00fchrer'' (short: '''Sdf'''; or '''Sf''' \u2013 in the meaning of '''specialist leader''' (literal: ''special leader'') \u2013 introduced to the [[Wehrmacht]] in the year 1937,<ref>{{cite book |author1=''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' |title=Mobilmachungsplan f\u00fcr das Heer vom 12.

There were few alterations and adjustments made as the army grew from a limited peacetime defense force of 100,000 men to a war-fighting force of several million men.\n\nThese ranks and insignia were specific to the Heer and in special cases to senior Wehrmacht officers in the independent services; the uniforms and rank systems of the other branches of the ''Wehrmacht'', the [[Ranks and insignia of the Luftwaffe (1935\u20131945)|''Luftwaffe'']] (Air Force) and [[Uniforms and insignia of the Kriegsmarine|''Kriegsmarine'']] (Navy), were different, as were those of the [[uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|SS]] which was a Party organization outside the ''Wehrmacht.'' The [[Nazi Party]] also had its own series of [[Nazi Germany paramilitary ranks|paramilitary uniforms and insignia]].\n\n==Insignia==\n\n===National Emblem (breast eagle): ''Hoheitszeichen'' or ''Wehrmachtsadler''===\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal \n| align     = right\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Wehrmachtsadler\n| image1    = Wehrmachtsadler-1935.svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Wehrmachtsadler-1939.svg\n| caption2  = 1939\n| image3    = Wehrmachtsadler-1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Wehrmachtsadler-1944.svg\n| caption4  = 1944\n| image5    = Wehrmachtsadler-Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\nThe ''[[Reichswehr]]'s'' visual acknowledgement of the new [[Nazi Party|National Socialist]] reality came on 17 February 1934, when the Commander-in-Chief, [[Werner von Blomberg]], ordered the Nazi Party eagle-and-swastika, now [[Germany]]'s National Emblem, to be worn on uniform blouses and headgear effective 1 May.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=312}} The design adopted, in silver for the ''Reichsheer'' (army) and in gold for the ''Reichsmarine'' (navy), was a stylized eagle with outstretched, beveled wings clutching a wreathed mobile ''Hakenkreuz'', later to be called the ''Wehrmachtsadler'' (\"armed forces eagle\").{{efn|The ''Luftwaffe'', although a branch of the ''Wehrmacht'', would use its own eagle design.}} On tunics this took the form of a cloth patch about 9&nbsp;cm (3\u215d\") wide worn on the right breast, above the pocket. For enlisted uniforms it was jacquard-woven (\"BeVo\") or sometimes machine-embroidered in silver-grey rayon, for officers machine- or hand-embroidered in white silk or bright aluminum wire, and for generals hand-embroidered in gold bullion.{{efn|\"Gold bullion\" in this context does not (usually) refer to actual gold, but to gold-colored wire, typically a bronze alloy}} The backing was \"badge-cloth\" (''Abzeichentuch''), a close-woven velvetish fabric; this was originally ''Reichsheer'' grey, but in late 1935 the renamed ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht Heer]]'' changed its ''Abzeichentuch'' color to a dark blue-green called ''flaschengr\u00fcn'' (bottle-green).\n\nThe war brought several variations to the breast eagle, although it should be kept in mind that none of them was replaced or de-authorized, and all were being worn side by side at war's end. When hostilities began in 1939, on the enlisted ''Feldbluse'' or [[World War II German uniform#Field Tunic (Feldbluse) Model 1936|field blouse]] the eagle was changed from silver-white to matte grey for reduced visibility; and in 1940 backings began to be produced in field-grey (''feldgrau''). Another version appeared with the advent of the [[World War II German uniform#Field Blouse Model 1944|Model 1944 Field Blouse]], which used a triangular backing for speed and simplicity of manufacture. Very late in the war some ''Hoheitszeichen'' were simply printed on thin fabric.\n\nThere were also versions for other uniforms: both white and grey variants on black for the [[World War II German uniform#Panzer uniform (Sonderbekleidung der Panzertruppen)|Panzer uniform]], and in dull grey-blue on tan backing for the [[World War II German uniform#Tropical uniform|tropical]] (''[[Afrikakorps]]'') uniform.

By the middle of World War I these ornate collars had been reduced to an embroidered representation of short lengths of braid joined at the ends, sewn to patches worn at the front of the collar. When the ''Reichsheer'' was established in 1921 as Germany's first national army{{efn|The German Army of Imperial times comprised in wartime the armies of the Kingdoms of Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria and W\u00fcrttemberg under the Prussian General Staff (''Generalstab'').}} ''Litzen'' were prescribed as the universal collar device for all personnel other than generals, and the Third Reich continued the practice.\n\nHowever, for clarification it has to be distinguished between \"collar patch\" ({{lang-de|Kragenpatte or Kragenspiegel}}), and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] braid (Unteroffizierslitze or Kragenlitze) \u2013 the status symbol of all German NCO ranks \u2013 encircling the collar of the uniform tunic. An NCO wore both, collar patches, and the collar encircling braid. [[Commissioned officer]]s wore only collar patches.\n\n==== Design and versions ====\n{{main|Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)}}\nOn both collar points of any uniform jacket there was a collar patch. Each patch consisted of the padding, and two parallel facings ({{lang-de|Patten}}), the so-called ''Litzenspiegel'', symbolising the double braid of the 19th century.\n\nThe padding of full-dress collar patches showed the wearer's ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'' (corps color). The dress tunic version was embroidered in fine aluminum thread on a patch of ''badge cloth'' ({{lang-de|Abzeichentuch}}). The backing also showed through in the space between the two parallel facings of the collar patch, and formed so a colour center stripe.\n\nOn field \u2013 and service uniforms, beginning in late 1935, the collar patch was dark bottle-green to match the collar; the ''Waffenfarbe'' \"showed through\" (in fact colored cord was sewn into) the center strip of each braid, the ''Litzenspiegel.''\n\nFor enlisted men, service ''collar patches'' were machine-woven in silver-grey rayon; COs' were embroidered more elaborately in white silk or aluminium thread, and were somewhat larger to match their higher collars.\n\nNCOs ({{lang-de|Unteroffiziere}}) wore standard enlisted collar patches but were distinguished by a strip of 9mm silver-grey diamond-woven rayon braid (Unteroffoziers-Tressen, NCO-Tressen), sewn around the collar, except on the dress, where the NCO-Tresse was bright aluminum. However, the aluminum-embroidered NCO-Tressen on dress uniforms ({{lang-de|Ausgangsuniform, Paradeuniform}}) encircled the collar's upper edge, the simpler NCO-Tressen on service \u2013 or field uniform encircled the collar's lower edge.{{Clear}}\n\n====Universal design from 1938====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted versions\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen Dress.svg\n| caption1  = <center>Dress</center>\n| image2    = Mannschaft Litzen 1938.svg\n| caption2  = <center>Field, 1938</center>\n| image3    = Mannschaft Litzen 1940.svg\n| caption3  = <center>Field, 1940</center>\n}}\n\n[[File:Feldgendarmerie.JPG|thumb|right|120px|Field tunic with collar patches, NCO-Tressen and [[Gorget]], post 1940.]]\n\nBy 1938 the fast-growing ''Heer'' had found that it was impractical, for the enlisted field uniform, to manufacture and stock a multitude of collar patches in assorted ''Waffenfarben'' which also had to be sewn on and frequently changed by unit tailors. Accordingly, new universal collar patches were introduced with the ''Litzenspiegel'' and ''Mittelstreifen''{{Explain|date=March 2018}} woven in dark green to match the backing patch, and which could be applied at the factory; ''Waffenfarbe'' was now displayed on the shoulder-straps, which simply buttoned on and were easily switched.\n\nWith the wartime change to lower-visibility insignia enlisted collar patches were woven in matte \"mouse-grey\" with field-grey stripes, which were at first sewn to green collar patches as before but increasingly directly to the collar, which beginning in 1940 was made in ''feldgrau'' like the uniform; grey collar patches were never produced. The troops however preferred the green patches (and collars) if they had or could get them, especially on \"clean\" uniforms for walking-out; and long-service veterans took particular pride in pre-38 versions.\n\nIn contrast, officers' service uniform collar patches never changed. While most officers in the front lines wore the enlisted field uniform as per wartime regulations, many opted to have their green-and-silver collar patches added instead of (or on top of) the factory versions. \n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen Trop.svg\n| caption1  = <center><small>field & service</small></center>\n| header    = Enlisted versions, tropic\n}}\n\nOn olive tropical uniforms the collar patches were tan with dull grey-blue ''Litzenspiegel'' for all personnel; officers again sometimes added their green collar patches. Tropical NCO collar ''Tressen'' were copper-brown, or sometimes olive drab.{{Clear}}\n\n====Armored vehicle uniforms====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| width     = 45\n| header    = [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFV]] crew collar insignia\n| image1    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten mit Totenkopf.jpg\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten mit Litzen.jpg\n| caption2  =\n| image3    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten ohne Abzeichen.jpg\n| footer    = <center><small>[[Waffenfarbe]] (assault artillery)</small></center>\n| footer_background = red\n}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     =\n| image3    = Panzer Totenkopf.jpg\n| caption3  = <center><small>Death's-head</small></center>\n| width3    = 60\n| image1    = Panzersonderbekleidung Kragenpatten.jpg\n| caption1  = <center><small>collar patch</small></center>\n| width1    = 40\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption2  = <center><small>shoulder strap</small></center>\n| width2    = 120\n| header    = rank insignias armored troops\n| footer    = <center><small>[[Waffenfarbe]] (armored corps)</small></center>\n| footer_background = #FF99CC\n}}\n\nA major exception to the wearing of ''Litzen'' was the \"panzer wrap\" ({{lang-de|Panzerjacke}}), the double-breasted jacket worn by crews of tanks and other armored vehicles. When the ''[[Panzertruppe]]'' were established in 1935 they were issued a [[World War II German uniform#Panzer uniform|distinctive black uniform]] and as a badge the ''Totenkopf'' or Death's-head, versions of which had formerly been worn by the Imperial tank corps and [[Media:AugustvonMackensen.jpg|various cavalry units]]. These skulls took the form of white-metal pins attached to black ''Kragenpatten'' which were edged in ''Waffenfarbe'' piping.\n\nIn mid-1940 crews of assault guns (''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]en'') received a uniform of their own, identical in cut to the ''Panzerjacke'' but in standard field-grey, which they wore with red artillery piping. Over the course of the war a bewildering and changing series of regulations governed the uniforms and insignia for assault guns, tank destroyers, armored cars and self-propelled guns (SPG). Depending on the unit and the date either the black or grey wrap or the standard ''Feldbluse'' might be authorized, and on the grey \"assault gun\" jacket the regulation collar patches could be black with skulls, or grey with skulls, ''Litzen'', or no device at all. The result in practice was chaos; wartime photos show a mix of uniforms and insignia worn not only in the same battalion, but even in the same vehicle.\n\nOfficially both colours of panzer wrap were working and field uniforms to be worn only in or around the vehicle; this regulation was universally ignored. ''Panzertruppen'' were issued standard uniforms for service-dress and walking out but rarely wore them, much preferring their unique jackets.\n\nIn North Africa, [[Armored fighting vehicle|AFV crews]] wore the same tropical uniform as the other branches, including collar patches; many tankers however pinned their ''Totenkopf'' badges to their lapels.{{Clear}}\n\n====Infanterie Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"====\n[[File:Special Single Litzen for NCO ranks of Gro\u00dfdeutschland IR.jpg|thumb|left|200px|NCOs' collar patch and ''Tressen'' of I.R. \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"]]\n\nIn June 1939, the Wehrmacht Heer wanted to renew its ties with the Old Army tradition by introducing a new uniform for its most prestigious unit: ''Wachregiment \"Berlin\"'' which was renamed [[Infantry Regiment Gro\u00dfdeutschland|Infantry Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"]]. The new dress uniform for I.R. \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\" had an elongated collar patch with single ''Litzenspiegel'' for NCOs and two for enlisted. Although shown to the press, this new uniform was not provided to the unit due to the outbreak of World War II and was placed in depot storage.{{Clear}}\n\n==== General Staff Corps Officers ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-130-51, Rudolf-Christoph v.

They ranked from ''Hauptmann im Generalstab'' (captain) through ''Oberst i.G.'' (colonel). All were, before 1939, graduates of the Military Academy, the ''[[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]]''. On division staffs they held the position of '''Ia''' (operational chief of staff) or '''Ib''' (chief of the rear echelon). In the higher echelons, the intelligence and training staff sections were most of the time in the personal charge of General Staff Corps officers. The General Staff Officers had their own distinctive Litzen called ''alt-Preu\u00dfische'' (old Prussian), or ''Kolbenstickerei'' (\"lobe-embroidery\"). These were the same whether on carmine dress ''Kragenpatten'' or green service patches; colored ''Litzenspiegel'' were unnecessary. General Staff officers assigned to the supreme headquarters (the ''Reichskriegsministerium'', later the [[OKH]] and the [[OKW]]), the Kriegsakademie, and military attaches were further distinguished by having their Litzen in gold rather than silver. These Generalstaboffiziere were called \"des Generalstabs\", Oberst d.G., etc. The special golden Litzen were abolished in November 1942. Only Military attaches kept their Litzen as long as they were in their present position. The F\u00fchrer wanted a closer union between the front and the OKW and OKH.\n\nIn addition to their collar patches, General Staff Officers wore trouser-stripes, of the same design as generals' but in carmine rather than scarlet.\n\n====Generals====\n[[File:WMacht arabesques OF10toOF6-hor 1945.jpg|left|120px]]\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0408-503, Walter v.

These devices, sometimes called ''Arabesken'' (arabesques), were embroidered in gold bullion or golden synthetic ''Celleon'' on ''Hochrot'' (scarlet) backing.\nField Marshals wore the same ''Arabesken'' as generals until April 1941, when they were authorized a longer variant with three rather than two iterations of the repeating pattern, for a total of six \"prongs\".{{sfn|Rosignoli|1975|p=209}} In some cases GFM did not bother to replace their generals' tabs, or did so only on their dress uniforms.\n\nGeneral officers of the Special Troop Service (''Truppensonderdienst'' \u2013 TDS) and of the specialist careers (medical, veterinary, ordnance, and motor park) wore the same insignia until April 1944, when they were ordered to exchange their scarlet ''Kragenpatten'' for ''alt-Larisch'' tabs backed in their respective ''[[Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)|Waffenfarbe:]]''\n\n* {{Farbindex|93CCEA|bright blue}} \u2013 TDS administrative;\n* {{Farbindex|6495ED|cornflower blue}} \u2013 medical;\n* {{Farbindex|FF7538|orange}} \u2013 ordnance;{{efn|Before June 1944 their Waffenfarbe was bright red.}}\n* {{Farbindex|FFC0CB|pink}} \u2013 motor park;\n* {{Farbindex|960018|carmine}} \u2013 veterinary;\n* {{Farbindex|900020|wine red}} \u2013 TDS judiciary.\n\nIn October 1944, the wear-out period of the scarlet backing color for Generals of the specialist careers was extended for an undetermined period.\n\nThese [[Gorget patches|arabesque collar patches]] are still worn today by general officers of the present-day [[Bundeswehr]].\n\n=====Chief=====\n[[File:VonRundstedt-Shoulderboards-alt-Larisch.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Gorget patch|Kragenpatte]] & [[Epaulette]] of von Rundstedt]]\nIn the Wehrmacht Heer, upon retirement, certain senior German generals were awarded the honorary post of ''Chef'' (Chief) of a regiment, much like the [[Honorary Colonel]] in the British Army. It was a German custom dating from the late 18th century.  These generals were authorized to wear the tunic and insignia of an officer of the regiment, including ordinary officers' ''Litzen.'' Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], ''Chef'' of the {{ill|18th Infantry Regiment (Germany)|lt=18th Infantry Regiment|de|18. Infanterie-Regiment (Reichswehr)}}, wore a big 18 on his shoulderboards, and for everyday wear favored the ornamented tunic of an infantry officer with white piping rather than a general's uniform.\n\nHitler appointed first Generaloberst [[Hans von Seeckt]], ancient \"Chef der Heeresleitung\", to be Chef of the 67th Infanterie Regiment on his 70th birthday in April 1936, a few months before he died. Only seven German generals were appointed Chefs: in addition to Seeckt and Rundstedt they were General der Infanterie [[Franz Ritter von Epp|Ritter von Epp]] (Chef of the 61st Infanterie Regiment in Munich); Generalfeldmarschall [[August von Mackensen|von Mackensen]] (Chef of the 5th Kavallerie Regiment in [[Stolp]]); Generaloberst [[Werner von Fritsch|von Fritsch]] (Chef of the 12th Artillerie Regiment in Schwerin); and Generalfeldmarschall [[Eduard von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli|von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli]] (Chef of the 28th Infanterie Regiment in [[Troppau]]). Generalfeldmarschall [[von Blomberg]] was appointed Chef of Infanterie Regiment 73 and wore a big 73 superimposed over the crossed batons of his shoulder board, but on 4 February 1938 he was dismissed and his name was deleted from the seniority list.\n\n===Shoulder-straps (''Schulterklappen'') and shoulderboards (''Schulterst\u00fccke'')===\n\n====Enlisted men====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 80\n| image1    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1936).svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1938-1940) vertical.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaften Epaulette 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption4  = Panzer\n| image5    = Mannschaften Epaulette Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n\n}}\n\nThe ''Reichsheer's'' shoulder-straps were very similar to those of World War I, made of ''feldgrau'' uniform cloth with pointed or \"gable\" button ends. In December 1934 the material was changed to grey badge-cloth (''Abzeichentuch'') and in September 1935 changed again to dark bottle-green (''flaschengr\u00fcn''). These \"first pattern\" shoulder-straps were not edged in ''Waffenfarbe'' piping.\n\nIn 1938, simultaneous with the removal of ''Waffenfarbe'' from field-uniform collar patches, new shoulder-straps were issued. These \"second pattern\" straps had round rather than pointed ends, and were edged on three sides with wool (later rayon) piping in ''Waffenfarbe.''  This pattern would be used through the end of the war, although in 1940 manufacture reverted to field-grey uniform cloth, and as usual alternate versions were made to go with the Panzer uniform (black), tropical uniform (olive cotton) and [[World War II German uniform#HBT fatigue and summer uniforms (Drillichanzug/Sommerfeldanzug)|HBT summer uniform]] (reed-green twill). ''Schulterklappen'' were not worn with the fatigue uniform, nor with camouflage smocks and parkas which used an [[Ranks and Insignia of the German Army in World War II#Smock/parka rank insignia|alternate system of rank insignia]].\n\nFor junior enlisted men (''Mannschaften''), rank insignia if any was worn on the left sleeve. However the epaulettes did indicate the wearer's unit (usually regiment or independent battalion) together with his sub-branch if any, machine-embroidered in branch-color. For example, a ''Schulterklappe'' with rose-pink piping and number \"4\" would indicate the 4th Panzer Regiment; but if it carried a pink number \"4\" and letter \"A\" it would indicate the 4th Armored Reconnaissance (''Aufkl\u00e4rungs'') Battalion. The German Army used a very large assortment of Latin initials, Gothic initials, script ciphers, Arabic numerals, Roman numerals and symbols to designate all its various service branches and installations. Before the war, shoulder-buttons were embossed with the number of the wearer's company as well, this practice was discontinued \"for the duration.\"\n[[File:Trop Oberwachtmeister epaulette.jpg|thumb|right|80px|Cavalry ''Oberwachtmeister'', tropical]]\nBeginning in January 1940, shoulder-straps with unit insignia were (supposed to be) phased out as a security measure, and removable fabric loops with devices were issued instead. In May 1944 the embroidery was changed from ''waffenfarbe'' to light gray.\n\nNon-commissioned officers wore their rank insignia on their shoulder-straps, consisting of braid and pips (pyramidal \"stars\"). An ''Unteroffizier's'' (corporal's) epaulette was edged with ''Tresse'' on three sides and an ''Unterfeldwebel's'' (sergeant's) on all four. Senior NCO's (''Unteroffiziere mit Portepee'') added one to three pips; in addition, their unit identifiers took the form of white-metal pins rather than embroidery.\n\nShoulder-straps were made in both a standard width (4.5&nbsp;cm, 1\u00be\") and a wider one for three-digit unit numbers (5.3&nbsp;cm, 2\"), and in three lengths depending on the size of the man. There was in addition an extra-large size for the overcoat (''Mantel'').\n\n====Officers====\n\n[[File:Hauptmann Epaulette.jpg|thumb|left|90px]]\nOfficers' shoulderboards were constructed from \"Russia\" braid, an aluminum-thread double piping. Company-grade officers (''Leutnant'' through ''Hauptmann/Rittmeister'') wore epaulettes constructed by wrapping two side-by-side lengths of braid around the buttonhole and back, giving the appearance of eight parallel cords; the whole was sewn to an underlay (''Unterlagen'') of ''Waffenfarbe'' badge-cloth. Until 1938 the underlay was of the same outer dimensions as the braid, and only visible edge-on; in that year the underlay was made wider, so as to create the impression of edge piping like the enlisted shoulder-strap. Rank was indicated by zero to two gilt-metal pips; unit designators were also of gilt metal.\n[[File:Major Epaulette.jpg|thumb|right|95px]]\nField-grade officer (''Stabsoffizier'') shoulderboards were made by plaiting together double widths of Russia braid and looping them to form a buttonhole, sewn to a ''Waffenfarbe'' underlay; rank again was displayed by zero to two gilt pips.\n\nOnce the war began, dull grey aluminum braid appeared, but bright aluminum continued in use.\n\n====Generals====\n[[File:Wehrmacht Generalsrangabzeichen.jpg|thumb|300px|Generals' shoulderboards, Wehrmacht (Heer)]]\n*'''1''' [[Generalfeldmarschall]] ([[OF-10]], [[five-star rank]], shoulder strap from April 1941)\n*'''2''' [[Generalfeldmarschall]] (OF-10, five-star rank, shoulder strap prior to April 1941)\n*'''3''' [[Generaloberst]] (OF-9, [[four-star rank]])\n*'''4''' [[General of the branch]] (OF-8, [[three-star rank]])\n*'''5''' [[Generalleutnant]] (OF-7, [[two-star rank]])\n*'''6''' [[Generalmajor]] (OF-6, [[one-star rank]])\n\nGenerals' shoulderboards were constructed similarly to those of field-grade officers, but comprised a length of silver Russia braid between two braided cords of gold bullion or ''Celleon.'' Since the resulting combination was wider, generals' boards were plaited in four 'loops' rather than five. Their buttons were gilt, and rank was indicated by zero to three silver pips, or crossed batons in the case of field marshals. The underlay was scarlet, except (from 1944) for generals of staff corps, who were instructed to wear ''Waffenfarbe'' instead.\n\nIn April 1941, ''Generalfeldmarschall'' epaulettes were changed to incorporate a central gold cord instead of silver.\n\nColonels-in-chief wearing that uniform wore gold generals' shoulderboards underlaid with the ''Waffenfarbe'' of the regiment rather than scarlet; GFM von Rundstedt sometimes simply pinned his crossed batons to an infantry colonel's epaulettes.\n\n====Retired personnel====\n[[File:Wehrmacht Generalmajor (a.D.).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Generalmajor a.D.]]\nBy order of Marshal Hindenburg in March 1932, soldiers who retired after 15 years of service received the right to wear the uniform of the unit they left. The shoulderboards and shoulder straps of retired soldiers had a bridle 1.5&nbsp;cm wide attached under the middle.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[File:Schirmmutze cap badges.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Eagle/swastika and wreathed cockade used on the peaked cap (Schirmm\u00fctze).]] [[File:Insignias casco.svg|thumb|Decals of Heer used on various helmets.]]\nCaps and helmets bore two common insignia elements, in various forms: the [[Coat of arms of Germany#Nazi Germany|National Emblem]] and the national colors. World War I caps had carried dual [[cockades]] or roundels, one in Imperial black-white-red and one in the colors of the particular State within the Empire. The ''[[Reichswehr]]'' changed this to a single cockade in the Weimar Republic's black, red and gold; almost as soon as Hitler took power he restored the [[Flag of Germany#North German Confederation and the German Empire (1866\u20131918)|pre-1919 tricolor flag]], and ordered the Army to return to black-white-red.\n\n===Belt buckles (''Koppelschl\u00f6sser'')===\n[[File:Koppelschloss Wehrmacht.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Enlisted ''Koppelschlo\u00df'']]\nBelt buckles for enlisted men were of box type, made of aluminum or stamped steel and bearing a circular device with a version of the ''Hoheitszeichen'' called the Army eagle or ''Heeresadler'' (an eagle with downswept wings clutching an unwreathed swastika) surmounted by the motto ''[[Gott mit uns]]'', or \"God with us.\" For field wear these were usually painted field-grey to reduce visibility and had a smooth finish; on the other hand, dress buckles were silver-washed with a pebbled surface surrounding the Hoheitszeichen.\n\nOfficers' field and service buckles were of a two-pronged frame type. With dress uniform officers wore a belt of silver braid with a circular silver-washed or -plated aluminum buckle, in the form of an oakleaf wreath surrounding a ''Heeresadler.'' Generals' were the same but gilt or gold-plated.\n\nWith the tropical uniform and its belt of cotton webbing, officers wore a buckle identical to the dress buckle but painted olive-drab.\n\n==Ranks and rank insignia==\n\n===Rank tables===\n\n====Enlisted personnel (''Mannschaften'')====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted collar ''Litzen''\n| footer    = Red ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'': artillery\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen 1934.svg\n| alt1      = Mannschaft Litzen 1935\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaft Litzen 1938.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaft Litzen 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaft Litzen Dress.svg\n| caption4  = Dress\n| image5    = Mannschaft Litzen Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted ''Schulterklappen''\n| footer    = White ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'': infantry, rose pink: armor\n| image1    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1936).svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1938-1940) vertical.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaften Epaulette 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption4  = Panzer uniform\n| image5    = Mannschaften Epaulette Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He was therefore roughly analogous to a Company Sergeant-Major or First Sergeant, although his duties did not usually involve combat leadership. ''Der Spie\u00df''{{efn|\"The spear.\" This may refer to the sergeant of a flintlock-era company having carried a [[polearm]] rather than a musket, or it may relate to Latin ''pilus prior'' \"leading spear,\" the senior centurion in a cohort.}} or ''die Kompanie-Mutter'', as he was called, was not necessarily the ranking ''Unteroffizier'' in the company, especially since typically two of the platoons were commanded by senior NCOs rather than officers. A ''Hauptfeldwebel'' however had to be \nof ''Portepee'' grade; a junior NCO filling the role was a ''Hauptfeldwebeldiensttuer,'' \"one doing ''Hauptfeldwebel'' duties.\"\n\nThe insignia for a ''Hauptfeldwebel'' was a pair of NCO ''Tressen'' encircling each lower sleeve, nicknamed \"piston rings;\" he also carried a leather ''Meldetasche'' or report-case tucked into his tunic front.\n\n====Senior non-commissioned specialist officers====\nIn two specialist career paths it was possible to attain rank above ''Stabsfeldwebel'': fortifications engineers (''Festungspioniere'') and farriers (''Hufbeschlagschmieder'').{{efn|Farriers, blacksmiths specializing in the shoeing and care of horses, were a very important component of the WWII German army, 70\u201380% of which depended on horse-drawn transport.

They consist of civil service personnel performing functions within the Armed Forces and are recruited, in part, from former professional non-commissioned officers who became military candidates for civil service ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4ranw\u00e4rter}}) at the end of their 12-year contractual period of active military service.\n\nUp to 1944, none of these officials were classified as soldiers; in that year certain groups were converted into officers in the Special Troop Service (''Truppensonderdienst'' or TSD). These were the higher administrative officers (''Intendanten'') in ranks from captain to lieutenant general; the lower administrative officers (''Zahlmeister'') in the ranks of first and second lieutenant, and the judge advocates (''Richter'') in ranks from captain to lieutenant general. At this time all personnel of the Field Post Office were made soldiers as well, but formed a corps of their own rather than belonging to the TSD. It was also made possible for qualified reserve technical service officials to become reserve officers of the motor maintenance troops.\n\nThe officials had titles, not ranks: ''Intendant, Direktor, Rat, Vorsteher, Inspektor, Meister, Assistent''. This is a complex subject as each branch had its own titles.\n\n=== Military officials ===\n==== Shoulderboards ====\n{{main|Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)#Corps colours of the Heeresverwaltung}}\nWith certain exceptions, military officials ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4r-Beamte}}) wore shoulderboards similar to those of soldiers of equivalent rank, but distinguished by the addition of dark green elements: those equivalent to generals had a central cord in their braided shoulderboards which incorporated green chevrons, and those equivalent to officers wore a narrow green stripe between the rows of braid. WO-equivalent ''officials'' wore a complex braided shoulderboard made of green, black and silver cords. In nearly all cases the shoulderboard underlay was a double layer of dark green under ''Nebenfarbe'', and metal pins with the '''HV''' (German abbreviation of ''Heeresverwaltung'', \"Army Administration\") cipher were worn.\n\nCertain services had insignia of their own: for example the ''Feldpost'' (\"Field Post Office\") wore shoulderboards with gold rather than green elements and the initials '''FP'''; and musical officials wore silver-and-red shoulderboards with a lyre insignia. ''Beamten'' in the employ of a military administration authority in the occupied territories wore '''MV''' (German abbreviation of ''Milit\u00e4rverwaltung'', \"Military Administration\") pins rather than '''HV''' ciphers.\n\nMost officials wore in addition to their dark green Waffenfarbe a secondary colour (''Nebenfarbe'') denoting their branch:\n\nIn March 1940 distinct ''Nebenfarben'' were abolished and replaced with light grey.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = \n| image1   = \n| caption1  = <center><small>[[General officer]] ranks ('''1''' to '''3''') and [[Officer rank]]s ('''4''' to '''6''')</small></center>\n| width1     = 400\n| image2   =\n| caption2  = <center><small>Officer ranks ('''7''' to '''9'''), and [[Warrant officer]] ranks ('''10-11'''1)</small></center>\n| width2     = 345\n| header    = Rank insignias to officials of the Milit\u00e4rverwaltung (MV)\n| footer    = <center>Shoulder straps </center>\n| footer_background = \n}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = \n| caption1  = <center><small>[[General officer]] ranks ('''1-2'''), [[Officer rank]]s ('''3''' to '''7'''), and [[Warrant officer]] ranks ('''8-9''')</small></center>\n| width1     = 600\n| header    = File 2: Rank insignias to officials on the \"Reich\u00b4s court-martial\" <small>([[Reichskriegsgericht]])</small>\n| footer    = <center>Shoulder straps 1935 until 1945</center>\n| footer_background = \n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Collar patches ====\n''Heeresbeamten'' wore distinctive collar patches; these tabs indicated not the official's rank or title, but rather the \"grade\" of the service in which the official was employed. These were classified by the minimum educational requirement, and ranged from ''Einfacher Dienst'' (Basic Services), for which a grade-school education was sufficient, through ''Mitteler'' (Middle) and ''Gehobener'' (Elevated) ''Dienst'', to ''H\u00f6herer Dienst'' (Higher Services) which required a university degree.\n\nOfficials in the Basic Services wore collar patches similar to (but larger than) enlisted soldiers', grey ''Litzen'' on dark green ''Patten'', but the patch was piped on three sides in ''Nebenfarbe''; similarly officials in the Middle and Elevated services wore officer-pattern ''Litzen'', again with ''Nebenfarbe''-piped patches. Officials of the Higher Services wore unique ''Kragenpatten'' with ''alt-Preussische Litzen'' in gold like ''Offiziere des Generalstabs'', but on dark green with, again, ''Nebenfarbe'' piping. General officer-equivalents wore green patches with generals' arabesques, similarly bordered.\n\n=== ''Beamter auf Kriegsdauer'' ===\nIn addition to the career ''Beamten'', wartime needs led to the creation of \"Officials for the duration of the war,\" or ''Beamter auf Kriegsdauer''. These men had needed skills but either did not possess all the qualifications to become full-fledged ''Beamten,'' or were effectively drafted from civilian jobs. The matter was further confused by the fact that Beamter a. K. did the same jobs and held the same titles as career officials.\n\nNonetheless, Beamter a. K. wore entirely distinct collar patches. The backing patch was large and piped on three sides like that worn by career ''Beamten'', but was light grey edged in green. The device was a rectangle pointed at the upper end with braid down the center, much like a British general's [[gorget patch]], the colors indicating the degree of the ''Beamter's'' service: grey with green braid for basic services, silver with green braid for middle and elevated services, and gold on gold for higher services.\n\n=== Military Supreme Court officials (''Wehrmachtbeamte beim Reichskriegsgericht'') ===\nOfficials of the Wehrmacht who worked in Military Supreme Courts wore shoulder straps without the \"HV\" and had the secondary colour of Bordeaux red (''Bordorot'').\n\n=== ''Sonderf\u00fchrer'' ===\n{{Main|Sonderf\u00fchrer}}\n''Sonderf\u00fchrer'' (short: '''Sdf'''; or '''Sf''' \u2013 in the meaning of '''specialist leader''' (literal: ''special leader'') \u2013 introduced to the [[Wehrmacht]] in the year 1937,<ref>{{cite book |author1=''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' |title=Mobilmachungsplan f\u00fcr das Heer vom 12.

Butler was, at the time of his death, the most decorated Marine in U.S. history. During his 34-year career as a Marine, he participated in military actions in the Philippines, China, in Central America and the Caribbean during the [[Banana Wars]], and France in [[World War I]]. Butler later became an outspoken critic of American wars and their consequences. Butler also exposed an [[Business Plot|alleged plan]] to overthrow the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]].\n\nBy the end of his career, Butler had received 16&nbsp;medals, five for heroism. He is one of 19 men to receive the [[Medal of Honor]] twice, one of three to be awarded both the [[Marine Corps Brevet Medal]] (along with Wendell Neville and David Porter) and the Medal of Honor, and the only Marine to be awarded the Brevet Medal and two Medals of Honor, all for separate actions.\n\nIn 1933, he became involved in a controversy known as the [[Business Plot]], when he told a congressional committee that a group of wealthy industrialists were planning a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] to overthrow [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator, similar to Fascist regimes at that time. The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot and the media ridiculed the allegations, but a final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler's testimony.\n\nIn 1935, Butler wrote a book titled ''[[War Is a Racket]]'', where he described and criticized the workings of the United States in its foreign actions and wars, such as those in which he had been involved, including the American corporations and other [[American imperialism|imperialist]] motivations behind them. After retiring from service, he became a popular advocate, speaking at meetings organized by veterans, [[Pacifism|pacifists]], and church groups in the 1930s.\n\n==Early life==\nSmedley Darlington Butler was born July 30, 1881, in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], the eldest of three sons. His parents, [[Thomas S. Butler|Thomas]] and Maud (n\u00e9e Darlington) Butler,<ref name=\"Schmidt7\">Hans Schmidt, ''Maverick Marine: General Smedley D. Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1998) p. 7</ref> were descended from local [[Quaker]] families.

His transcript stated that he completed the scientific course \"with Credit\".<ref name=\"Schmidt7\" />\n\n==Military career==\n\n===Spanish\u2013American War===\nIn the Spanish war fervor of 1898, Butler lied about his age to receive a direct commission as a Marine [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]].<ref name=\"Schmidt7\" /> He trained in Washington, DC, at the [[Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C.|Marine Barracks]] on the corner of 8th and I Streets SE. In July 1898 he went to [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], [[Cuba]], arriving shortly after its [[Battle of Guant\u00e1namo Bay|invasion and capture]].<ref name=\"letters\">Butler, Smedley Darlington and Venzon, Anne Cipria, 1992, p. 10</ref> His company soon returned to the U.S., and after a short break he was assigned to the armored cruiser {{USS|New York|ACR-2|6}} for four months.<ref name=\"Schmidt9\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 9</ref> He came home to be mustered out of service in February 1899,<ref name=\"Schmidt9\" /> but on April 8, 1899 he accepted a commission as a [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] in the Marine Corps.<ref name=\"Schmidt9\" />\n\n===Philippine\u2013American War===\n[[File:Smedley Butler in 1901.png|thumb|Smedley Butler, ca 1901]]\nThe Marine Corps sent him to [[Manila]], Philippines.<ref name=\"Schmidt10\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 10</ref> On garrison duty with little to do, Butler turned to alcohol to relieve the boredom. He once became drunk and was temporarily relieved of command after an unspecified incident in his room.<ref name=\"Schmidt11\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 11</ref>\n\nIn October 1899, he saw his first combat action when he led 300 Marines to take the town of [[Noveleta, Cavite|Noveleta]] from Filipino rebels known as ''Insurrectos''. In the initial moments of the assault his [[first sergeant]] was wounded. Butler briefly panicked, but quickly regained his composure and led his Marines in pursuit of the fleeing enemy.<ref name=\"Schmidt11\" /> By noon the Marines had dispersed the rebels and taken the town. One Marine had been killed and ten were wounded. Another 50 Marines had been incapacitated by the humid tropical heat.<ref name=\"Schmidt12\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 12</ref>\n\nAfter the excitement of this combat, garrison duty again became routine. Butler had a very large [[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]] tattoo made which started at his throat and extended to his waist. He also met [[Littleton Waller]], a fellow Marine with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. When Waller received command of a company in [[Guam]], he was allowed to select five officers to take with him. He chose Butler. Before they had departed, their orders were changed and they were sent to China aboard the {{USS|Solace|AH-2|6}} to help put down the [[Boxer Rebellion]].<ref name=\"Schmidt12\" />\n\n===Boxer Rebellion===\n[[File:Gallentry Storming of Tientsin.png|thumbnail|left|Butler being carried on the back of another Marine to safety across a river at the Battle of Tientsin.]]\nOnce in China, Butler was initially deployed at [[Tianjin|Tientsin]]. He took part in the [[Battle of Tientsin]] on July 13, 1900, and in the subsequent [[Gaselee Expedition]], during which he saw the mutilated remains of Japanese soldiers. When he saw another Marine officer fall wounded, he climbed out of a trench to rescue him. Butler was then himself shot in the thigh. Another Marine helped him get to safety, but also was shot. Despite his leg wound, Butler assisted the wounded officer to the rear. Four [[enlisted men]] would receive the Medal of Honor in the battle. Butler's commanding officer, Maj. Littleton W.T. Waller, personally commended him and wrote that \"for such reward as you may deem proper the following officers: Lieutenant Smedley D. Butler, for the admirable control of his men in all the fights of the week, for saving a wounded man at the risk of his own life, and under a very severe fire.\" Commissioned officers were not then eligible to receive the Medal of Honor, and Butler instead received a promotion to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] by [[brevet (military)|brevet]] while he recovered in the hospital, two weeks before his 19th birthday.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nHe was eligible for the Marine Corps [[Brevet Medal]] when it was created in 1921, and was one of only 20 Marines to receive it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/docs/boxer/boxer2.htm|title=Report of the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, Marines in China: The Relief Expedition|publisher=[[United States Marine Corps]]|date=September 29, 1900|accessdate=August 17, 2006}}</ref> His citation reads: {{quote|The Secretary of the Navy takes pleasure in transmitting to First Lieutenant Smedley Darlington Butler, United States Marine Corps, the Brevet Medal which is awarded in accordance with Marine Corps Order No. 26 (1921), for distinguished conduct and public service in the presence of the enemy while serving with the Second Battalion of Marines, near Tientsin, China, on 13 July 1900. On 28 March 1901, First Lieutenant Butler is appointed Captain by brevet, to take rank from 13 July 1900.<ref name=Militarytimes />}}\n\n===The Banana Wars===\nButler participated in a series of occupations, \"police actions\" and interventions by the United States in Central America and the [[Caribbean]], commonly called the [[Banana Wars]] because their goal was to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the [[United Fruit Co]]. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane and other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the [[Panama Canal]]. These interventions started with the Spanish\u2013American War in 1898 and ended with the [[United States occupation of Haiti|withdrawal of troops from Haiti]] and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's [[Good Neighbor Policy]] in 1934.<ref name=\"langley\">Langley, 1983</ref> After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and [[Wall Street]] bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.<ref name=\"Schmidt231\" />\n\n====Honduras====\nIn 1903 Butler was stationed in [[Puerto Rico]] on [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra Island]]. Hearing rumors of a Honduran revolt, the United States government ordered his unit and a supporting naval detachment to sail to Honduras, {{convert|1500|mi|0|sp=us}} to the west, to defend the [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|U.S. Consulate]] there. Using a converted banana boat renamed the ''Panther'', Butler and several hundred Marines landed at the port town of [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]]. In a letter home, he described the action: they were \"prepared to land and shoot everybody and everything that was breaking the peace\",<ref name=\"Schmidt28-32\">Schmidt, 1998, pp. 28\u201332</ref> but instead found a quiet town. The Marines re-boarded the ''Panther'' and continued up the coast line, looking for rebels at several towns, but found none.\n\nWhen they arrived at [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]], however, they heard gunfire, and came upon a battle in progress that had been waged for 55 hours between rebels called ''Bonillista'' and Honduran government soldiers at a local fort. At the sight of the Marines, the fighting ceased and Butler led a detachment of Marines to the American consulate, where he found the consul, wrapped in an American flag, hiding among the floor beams. As soon as the Marines left the area with the shaken consul, the battle resumed and the Bonillistas soon controlled the government.<ref name=\"Schmidt28-32\" /> During this expedition Butler earned the first of his nicknames, \"Old Gimlet Eye\". It was attributed to his feverish, bloodshot eyes\u2014he was suffering from some unnamed tropical fever at the time\u2014that enhanced his penetrating and bellicose stare.<ref name=\"Schmidt50\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 50</ref>\n\n====Marriage and business====\nAfter the Honduran campaign Butler returned to Philadelphia. He married Ethel Conway Peters of Philadelphia in [[Bay Head, New Jersey]], a daughter of civil engineer and railroad executive [[Richard Peters (clubman)|Richard Peters]], on June 30, 1905.<ref>{{cite news|title=Butler\u2212Peters|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/07/01/101705904.pdf|accessdate=October 9, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 1, 1905}}</ref> His best man at the wedding was his former commanding officer in China, Lt.

In 1908 he was diagnosed as having a nervous breakdown and received nine months sick leave, which he spent at home. He successfully managed a coal mine in [[West Virginia]], but returned to active duty in the Marine Corps at the first opportunity.<ref name=boot144>Boot, 2003, p. 144</ref>\n\n====Central America====\nFrom 1909 to 1912 Butler served in [[Nicaragua]] enforcing U.S. policy. With a 104-degree fever he led his battalion to the relief of a rebel-besieged city, [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]]. In December 1909 he commanded the [[3rd Battalion 1st Marines|3d Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment]] on the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. On August 11, 1912, he was temporarily detached to command an expeditionary battalion he led in the [[Battle of Masaya]] on September 19, 1912, and the bombardment, assault and capture of [[Coyotepe Hill]], Nicaragua, in October 1912. He remained in Nicaragua until November 1912, when he rejoined the Marines of [[3rd Battalion 1st Marines|3d Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment]], at [[Camp Elliott]], Panama.<ref name=\"WhosWho\" />\n\n====Veracruz, Mexico, and first Medal of Honor====\n[[File:butlerveracruz.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Marine Officers at Veracruz. Front row, left to right: [[Wendell C. Neville]]; [[John A. Lejeune]]; Littleton W.T. Waller, Commanding; Smedley Butler|alt=Eight people in military uniforms. They are wearing hats and are standing in formation.]]\nButler and his family were living in Panama in January 1914 when he was ordered to report as the Marine officer of a battleship squadron massing off the coast of Mexico, near [[Veracruz]], to monitor a revolutionary movement. He did not like leaving his family and the home they had established in Panama and intended to request orders home as soon as he determined he was not needed.<ref name=\"Schmidt60-61\">Schmidt, 1998, pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nOn March 1, 1914, Butler and Navy Lt. (later Adm.) [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Frank J. Fletcher]] (not to be confused with his uncle, who was then Rear Adm. [[Frank Friday Fletcher|Frank F. Fletcher]]) \"went ashore at Veracruz, where they met the American superintendent of the Inter-Oceanic Railway and surreptitiously rode in his private car [a railway car] up the line 75 miles to [[Xalapa|Jalapa]] and back\".<ref name=\"Schmidt64w\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 64</ref> A purpose of the trip was to allow Butler and Fletcher to discuss the details of a future expedition into Mexico. Fletcher's plan required Butler to make his way into the country and develop a more detailed invasion plan while inside its borders. It was a spy mission and Butler was enthusiastic to get started. When Adm. Fletcher explained the plan to the commanders in Washington, DC, they agreed to it. Butler was given the go-ahead.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nA few days later he set out by train on his spy mission to Mexico City, with a stopover at Puebla. He made his way to the U.S. Consulate in [[Mexico City]], posing as a railroad official named \"Mr. Johnson\".\n* ''March 5''. As I was reading last night, waiting for dinner to be served, a visitant, rather than a visitor, appeared in my drawing-room ''incognito'' \u2013 a simple \"Mr. Johnson,\" eager, intrepid, dynamic, efficient, unshaven! * * *<ref name=\"O'Shaughnessy\">Edith O'Shaughnessy, ''A Diplomat's Wife in Mexico'' (Harper & Brothers, 1916) p. 212</ref>\n\nHe and the chief railroad inspector scoured the city, saying they were searching for a lost railroad employee; there was no lost employee, and in fact the employee they said was lost never existed. The ruse gave Butler access to various areas of the city. In the process of the so-called search, they located weapons in use by the Mexican army and determined the size of units and states of readiness. They updated maps and verified the railroad lines for use in an impending US invasion.<ref name=\"Schmidt64-65\">Schmidt, 1998, pp. 64\u201365</ref>\n\nOn March 7, 1914, he returned to Veracruz with the information he had gathered and presented it to his commanders. The invasion plan was eventually scrapped when authorities loyal to Mexican Gen. [[Victoriano Huerta]] detained a small American naval landing party (that had gone ashore to buy gasoline) in [[Tampico, Mexico]], which led to what became known as the [[Tampico Affair]].<ref name=\"Schmidt67-68\">Schmidt, 1998, pp. 67\u201368</ref>\n\nWhen President [[Woodrow Wilson]] discovered that an arms shipment was about to arrive in Mexico, he sent a contingent of Marines and sailors to Veracruz to intercept it on April 21, 1914. Over the next few days street fighting and sniper fire posed a threat to Butler's force, but a door-to-door search rooted out most of the resistance. By April 26 the landing force of 5,800 Marines and sailors secured the city, which they held for the next six months. By the end of the conflict the Americans reported 17 dead and 63 wounded and the Mexican forces had 126 dead and 195 wounded. After the actions at Veracruz, the US decided to minimize the bloodshed and changed their plans from a full invasion of Mexico to simply [[United States occupation of Veracruz|maintaining the city of Veracruz]].<ref name=\"Schmidt68-70\">Schmidt, 1998, pp. 68\u201370</ref> For his actions on April 22, Butler was awarded his first Medal of Honor.<ref name=\"WhosWho\" /><ref name=Militarytimes /> The citation reads: {{quote|For distinguished conduct in battle, engagement of Vera Cruz, 22 April 1914.

The army presented one, nine went to Marines and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I Butler, then a [[Major (United States)|major]], attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing to deserve it. The medal was returned to him with orders to keep it and to wear it as well.<ref name=AboveAndBeyond114>{{cite book |title=Above and Beyond, A History of the Medal of Honor from the Civil War to Vietnam |page=[https://archive.org/details/abovebeyondhist00bost/page/113 113] |author=Editors of the Boston Publishing Company |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-8094-5628-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/abovebeyondhist00bost/page/113 }}</ref>\n\n====Haiti and second Medal of Honor====\nIn 1915 Haitian President [[Vilbrun Guillaume Sam]] was killed by a mob. In response, the United States ordered the {{USS|Connecticut|BB-18|6}} to Haiti with Maj. Butler and a group of Marines on board. On October 24, 1915, an estimated 400 ''Cacos'' [[Battle of Fort Dipitie|ambushed]] Butler's patrol of 44 mounted Marines when they approached [[Fort Dipitie]]. Surrounded by ''Cacos'', the Marines maintained their perimeter throughout the night. The next morning they charged the much larger enemy force by breaking out in three directions. The startled Haitians fled.<ref name=\"Schmidt80\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 80</ref> In early November Butler and a force of 700 Marines and sailors returned to the mountains to clear the area. At their temporary headquarters base at Le Trou they fought off an attack by about 100 ''Cacos''. After the Americans took several other forts and ramparts during the following days, only [[Fort Rivi\u00e8re]], an old French-built stronghold atop [[Montagne Noire]], was left.<ref name=\"Schmidt80\" />\n\nFor the operation Butler was given three companies of Marines and some sailors from the USS ''Connecticut'', about 100 men. They encircled the fort and gradually closed in on it. Butler reached the fort from the southern side with the 15th Company and found a small opening in the wall. The Marines entered through the opening and engaged the ''Cacos'' in hand-to-hand combat. Butler and the Marines took the rebel stronghold on November 17, an action for which he received his second Medal of Honor, as well as the Haitian Medal of Honor.<ref name=Militarytimes>{{Hall of Valor|2879|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}</ref> The entire battle lasted less than 20 minutes. Only one Marine was injured in the assault; he was struck by a rock and lost two teeth.<ref name=\"Schmidt1995p85\" /> All 51 Haitians in the Fort were killed.<ref name=\"Schmidt80\" /> Butler's exploits impressed [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] Franklin D. Roosevelt, who recommended the award based upon Butler's performance during the engagement.<ref name=\"Schmidt1995p81\">Schmidt, 1995, p. 81</ref> Once the medal was approved and presented in 1917, Butler achieved the distinction, shared with [[Daniel Daly|Dan Daly]], of being the only Marines to receive the Medal of Honor twice for separate actions.<ref name=\"WhosWho\" /> The citation reads: {{quote|For extraordinary heroism in action as Commanding Officer of detachments from the 5th, 13th, 23d Companies and the Marine and sailor detachment from the U.S.S.

Following a concentrated drive, several different detachments of Marines gradually closed in on the old French bastion fort in an effort to cut off all avenues of retreat for the Caco bandits. Reaching the fort on the southern side where there was a small opening in the wall, Major Butler gave the signal to attack and Marines from the 15th Company poured through the breach, engaged the Cacos in hand-to-hand combat, took the bastion and crushed the Caco resistance. Throughout this perilous action, Major Butler was conspicuous for his bravery and forceful leadership.<ref name=Militarytimes />}}\n\nSubsequently, as the initial organizer and commanding officer of the [[Gendarmerie d'Ha\u00efti]], the native police force, Butler established a record as a capable administrator. Under his supervision social order, administered by the dictatorship, was largely restored and many vital public works projects were successfully completed.<ref name=\"Schmidt92\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 92</ref> He recalled later that, during his time in Haiti, he and his troops \"hunted the ''Cacos'' like pigs.\"<ref name=\"Schmidt1995p85\">Schmidt, 1995, p. 85</ref>\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:butlerandfriends.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Butler (far right) with other Marines in Vera Cruz, Mexico, 1914.

He made several requests for a posting in France, writing letters to his personal friend, [[Wendell Cushing Neville]]. While Butler's superiors considered him brave and brilliant, they described him as \"unreliable.\"<ref name=\"letters\" />\n\nIn October 1918 he was promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] at the age of 37 and placed in command of [[Camp Pontanezen]] at [[Brest, France]], a debarkation depot that funneled troops of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] to the battlefields. The camp had been unsanitary, overcrowded and disorganized. [[U.S. Secretary of War]] [[Newton Baker]] sent novelist [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]] to report on the camp. She later described how Butler tackled the sanitation problems. He began by solving the problem of mud: \"[T]he ground under the tents was nothing but mud, [so] he had raided the wharf at Brest of the [[duckboards]] no longer needed for the trenches, carted the first one himself up that four-mile hill to the camp, and thus provided something in the way of protection for the men to sleep on.\"<ref name=\"letters\" /> [[General officer|Gen.]] [[John J. Pershing]] authorized a duckboard shoulder patch for the units. This earned Butler another nickname, \"Old Duckboard.\" For his exemplary service he was awarded both the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Army Distinguished Service Medal]] and [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] and the French [[Order of the Black Star]].<ref name=\"WhosWho\" /> The citation for the Army Distinguished Service Medal states: {{quote|The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Brigadier General Smedley Darlington Butler, United States Marine Corps, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I.

Freeland Kendrick]] asked President [[Calvin Coolidge]] to loan the City a military general to help him rid [[Philadelphia's municipal government]] of crime and corruption. At the urging of Butler's father,<ref name=mlb/> Coolidge authorized Butler to take the necessary leave from the Corps to serve as Philadelphia's director of public safety in charge of running the city's police and fire departments from January 1924 until December 1925.<ref name=\"WhosWho\" /> He began his new job by assembling all 4,000 of the city police into the Metropolitan Opera House in shifts to introduce himself and inform them that things would change while he was in charge.

In addition to raiding the speakeasies, he also attempted to eliminate other illegal activities: bootlegging, prostitution, gambling and police corruption. More zealous than he was political, he ordered crackdowns on the social elite's favorite hangouts, such as the [[Ritz-Carlton]] and the [[Union League]], as well as on drinking establishments that served the working class.<ref name=\"MarineCorps\">{{cite journal |title=Leatherneck legends; Swapping some sea stories at the birthday ball? Here are 8 of the Corps' best |journal=Marine Corps Times |date=November 15, 2004|pages=22}}</ref> Although he was effective in reducing crime and police corruption, he was a controversial leader. In one instance he made a statement that he would promote the first officer to kill a bandit and stated, \"I don't believe there is a single bandit notch on a policeman's guns {{Sic}} in this city; go out and get some.\"<ref name=\"Schmidt146\" /> Although many of the local citizens and police felt that the raids were just a show, they continued for several weeks.<ref name=\"Schmidt147\" />\n\nHe implemented programs to improve city safety and security. He established policies and guidelines of administration and developed a Philadelphia police uniform that resembled that of the Marine Corps.<ref name=\"Schmidt148\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 148</ref> Other changes included military-style checkpoints into the city, bandit-chasing squads armed with [[sawed-off shotgun]]s and armored police cars.<ref name=\"Schmidt148\" /> The press began reporting on the good and the bad aspects of Butler's personal war on crime. The reports praised the new uniforms, the new programs and the reductions in crime but they also reflected the public's negative opinion of their new Public Safety Director. Many felt that he was being too aggressive in his tactics and resented the reductions in their civil rights, such as the stopping of citizens at the city checkpoints. Butler frequently swore in his radio addresses, causing many citizens to suggest his behavior, particularly his language, was inappropriate for someone of his rank and stature.<ref name=\"Schmidt149\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 149</ref> Some even suggested Butler acted like a military dictator, even charging that he wrongfully used active-duty Marines in some of his raids.<ref name=\"Schmidt149\" /> Maj. R.A. Haynes, the federal Prohibition commissioner, visited the city in 1924, six months after Butler was appointed. He announced that \"great progress\"<ref name=\"Schmidt150\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 150</ref> had been made in the city and attributed that success to Butler.<ref name=\"Schmidt150\" />\n\nEventually Butler's leadership style and the directness of actions undermined his support within the community. His departure seemed imminent. Mayor Kendrick reported to the press, \"I had the guts to bring General Butler to Philadelphia and I have the guts to fire him.\"<ref name=\"Schmidt153\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 153</ref> Feeling that his duties in Philadelphia were coming to an end, Butler contacted Gen. Lejeune to prepare for his return to the Marine Corps. Not all of the city felt he was doing a bad job, though, and when the news started to leak that he would be leaving, people began to gather at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]].

Veterans of World War I, many of whom had been out of work since the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], sought immediate cash payment of Service Certificates granted to them eight years earlier via the [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act]] of 1924. Each Service Certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment, plus [[compound interest]]. The problem was that the certificates (like bonds), matured 20 years from the date of original issuance, thus, under extant law, the Service Certificates could not be redeemed until 1945. In June 1932, approximately 43,000 marchers\u201417,000 of whom were World War I veterans, their families, and affiliated groups\u2014protested in Washington, D.C.<ref name=FBI>{{cite web |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |url=http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/bonmarch.htm |title=Bonus March |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208194024/http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/bonmarch.htm <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=February 8, 2010}}</ref> The Bonus Expeditionary Force, also known as the \"[[Bonus Army]]\", marched on Washington to advocate the passage of the \"soldier's bonus\" for service during World War I. After Congress adjourned, bonus marchers remained in the city and became unruly. On July 28, 1932, two bonus marchers were shot by police, causing the entire mob to become hostile and riotous. The FBI, then known as the United States Bureau of Investigation, checked its fingerprint records to obtain the police records of individuals who had been arrested during the riots or who had participated in the bonus march.<ref name=FBI /><ref name=\"Schmidt216-226\">Schmidt, 1998, pp. 216\u2013226</ref>\n\nThe veterans made camp in the Anacostia flats while they awaited the congressional decision on whether or not to pay the bonus. The motion, known as the [[Wright Patman|Patman]] bill, was decisively defeated, but the veterans stayed in their camp. On July 19 Butler arrived with his young son Thomas, the day before the official eviction by the Hoover administration. He walked through the camp and spoke to the veterans; he told them that they were fine soldiers and they had a right to lobby Congress just as much as any corporation. He and his son spent the night and ate with the men, and in the morning Butler gave a speech to the camping veterans. He instructed them to keep their sense of humor and cautioned them not to do anything that would cost public sympathy.<ref name=\"Schmidt218\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 218</ref> On July 28, army cavalry units led by General [[Douglas MacArthur]] dispersed the Bonus Army by riding through it and using gas.

Van Zandt]] to recruit members for the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] (VFW). He described their effort as \"trying to educate the soldiers out of the sucker class.\" In his speeches he denounced the [[Economy Act]] of 1933, called on veterans to organize politically to win their benefits, and condemned the FDR administration for its ties to big business. The VFW reprinted one of his speeches with the title \"You Got to Get Mad\" in its magazine ''Foreign Service''. He said: \"I believe in...taking Wall St. by the throat and shaking it up.\"<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ortiz Stephen R | year = 2006 | title = The 'New Deal' for Veterans: The Economy Act, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Origins of the New Deal | journal = Journal of Military History | volume = 70 | pages = 434\u20135 }}</ref> He believed the rival veterans' group the [[American Legion]] was controlled by banking interests.

Butler was, at the time of his death, the most decorated Marine in U.S. history. During his 34-year career as a Marine, he participated in military actions in the Philippines, China, in Central America and the Caribbean during the [[Banana Wars]], and France in [[World War I]]. Butler later became an outspoken critic of American wars and their consequences. Butler also exposed an [[Business Plot|alleged plan]] to overthrow the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]].\n\nBy the end of his career, Butler had received 16&nbsp;medals, five for heroism. He is one of 19 men to receive the [[Medal of Honor]] twice, one of three to be awarded both the [[Marine Corps Brevet Medal]] (along with Wendell Neville and David Porter) and the Medal of Honor, and the only Marine to be awarded the Brevet Medal and two Medals of Honor, all for separate actions.\n\nIn 1933, he became involved in a controversy known as the [[Business Plot]], when he told a congressional committee that a group of wealthy industrialists were planning a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] to overthrow [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator, similar to Fascist regimes at that time. The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot and the media ridiculed the allegations, but a final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler's testimony.\n\nIn 1935, Butler wrote a book titled ''[[War Is a Racket]]'', where he described and criticized the workings of the United States in its foreign actions and wars, such as those in which he had been involved, including the American corporations and other [[American imperialism|imperialist]] motivations behind them. After retiring from service, he became a popular advocate, speaking at meetings organized by veterans, [[Pacifism|pacifists]], and church groups in the 1930s.\n\n==Early life==\nSmedley Darlington Butler was born July 30, 1881, in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], the eldest of three sons. His parents, [[Thomas S. Butler|Thomas]] and Maud (n\u00e9e Darlington) Butler,<ref name=\"Schmidt7\">Hans Schmidt, ''Maverick Marine: General Smedley D. Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1998) p. 7</ref> were descended from local [[Quaker]] families.  Both of his parents were of entirely [[English American|English ancestry]], all of whom had been in what is now the United States since the 17th century.<ref>Smedley D. Butler, USMC: A Biography  By Mark Strecker page 3</ref> His father was a lawyer, a judge and was later to become for 31&nbsp;years, a congressman and chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee during the [[Warren G. Harding|Harding]] and [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge]] administrations. Smedley's Marine Corps career successes occurred while his father held that politically influential Congressional seat controlling the Marine Corps manpower and budget.<ref name=mlb/> His maternal grandfather was [[Smedley Darlington]], a Republican congressman from 1887 to 1891.<ref name=\"WhosWho\">{{cite web|accessdate=August 13, 2013|title=Major General Smedley D.

Nevertheless, Haverford awarded him his high school diploma on June 6, 1898, before the end of his final year. His transcript stated that he completed the scientific course \"with Credit\".<ref name=\"Schmidt7\" />\n\n==Military career==\n\n===Spanish\u2013American War===\nIn the Spanish war fervor of 1898, Butler lied about his age to receive a direct commission as a Marine [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]].<ref name=\"Schmidt7\" /> He trained in Washington, DC, at the [[Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C.|Marine Barracks]] on the corner of 8th and I Streets SE. In July 1898 he went to [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], [[Cuba]], arriving shortly after its [[Battle of Guant\u00e1namo Bay|invasion and capture]].<ref name=\"letters\">Butler, Smedley Darlington and Venzon, Anne Cipria, 1992, p. 10</ref> His company soon returned to the U.S., and after a short break he was assigned to the armored cruiser {{USS|New York|ACR-2|6}} for four months.<ref name=\"Schmidt9\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 9</ref> He came home to be mustered out of service in February 1899,<ref name=\"Schmidt9\" /> but on April 8, 1899 he accepted a commission as a [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] in the Marine Corps.<ref name=\"Schmidt9\" />\n\n===Philippine\u2013American War===\n[[File:Smedley Butler in 1901.png|thumb|Smedley Butler, ca 1901]]\nThe Marine Corps sent him to [[Manila]], Philippines.<ref name=\"Schmidt10\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 10</ref> On garrison duty with little to do, Butler turned to alcohol to relieve the boredom. He once became drunk and was temporarily relieved of command after an unspecified incident in his room.<ref name=\"Schmidt11\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 11</ref>\n\nIn October 1899, he saw his first combat action when he led 300 Marines to take the town of [[Noveleta, Cavite|Noveleta]] from Filipino rebels known as ''Insurrectos''. In the initial moments of the assault his [[first sergeant]] was wounded. Butler briefly panicked, but quickly regained his composure and led his Marines in pursuit of the fleeing enemy.<ref name=\"Schmidt11\" /> By noon the Marines had dispersed the rebels and taken the town. One Marine had been killed and ten were wounded. Another 50 Marines had been incapacitated by the humid tropical heat.<ref name=\"Schmidt12\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 12</ref>\n\nAfter the excitement of this combat, garrison duty again became routine. Butler had a very large [[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]] tattoo made which started at his throat and extended to his waist. He also met [[Littleton Waller]], a fellow Marine with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. When Waller received command of a company in [[Guam]], he was allowed to select five officers to take with him. He chose Butler. Before they had departed, their orders were changed and they were sent to China aboard the {{USS|Solace|AH-2|6}} to help put down the [[Boxer Rebellion]].<ref name=\"Schmidt12\" />\n\n===Boxer Rebellion===\n[[File:Gallentry Storming of Tientsin.png|thumbnail|left|Butler being carried on the back of another Marine to safety across a river at the Battle of Tientsin.]]\nOnce in China, Butler was initially deployed at [[Tianjin|Tientsin]]. He took part in the [[Battle of Tientsin]] on July 13, 1900, and in the subsequent [[Gaselee Expedition]], during which he saw the mutilated remains of Japanese soldiers. When he saw another Marine officer fall wounded, he climbed out of a trench to rescue him. Butler was then himself shot in the thigh. Another Marine helped him get to safety, but also was shot. Despite his leg wound, Butler assisted the wounded officer to the rear. Four [[enlisted men]] would receive the Medal of Honor in the battle. Butler's commanding officer, Maj. Littleton W.T. Waller, personally commended him and wrote that \"for such reward as you may deem proper the following officers: Lieutenant Smedley D. Butler, for the admirable control of his men in all the fights of the week, for saving a wounded man at the risk of his own life, and under a very severe fire.\" Commissioned officers were not then eligible to receive the Medal of Honor, and Butler instead received a promotion to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] by [[brevet (military)|brevet]] while he recovered in the hospital, two weeks before his 19th birthday.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nHe was eligible for the Marine Corps [[Brevet Medal]] when it was created in 1921, and was one of only 20 Marines to receive it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/docs/boxer/boxer2.htm|title=Report of the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, Marines in China: The Relief Expedition|publisher=[[United States Marine Corps]]|date=September 29, 1900|accessdate=August 17, 2006}}</ref> His citation reads: {{quote|The Secretary of the Navy takes pleasure in transmitting to First Lieutenant Smedley Darlington Butler, United States Marine Corps, the Brevet Medal which is awarded in accordance with Marine Corps Order No. 26 (1921), for distinguished conduct and public service in the presence of the enemy while serving with the Second Battalion of Marines, near Tientsin, China, on 13 July 1900. On 28 March 1901, First Lieutenant Butler is appointed Captain by brevet, to take rank from 13 July 1900.<ref name=Militarytimes />}}\n\n===The Banana Wars===\nButler participated in a series of occupations, \"police actions\" and interventions by the United States in Central America and the [[Caribbean]], commonly called the [[Banana Wars]] because their goal was to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the [[United Fruit Co]]. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane and other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the [[Panama Canal]]. These interventions started with the Spanish\u2013American War in 1898 and ended with the [[United States occupation of Haiti|withdrawal of troops from Haiti]] and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's [[Good Neighbor Policy]] in 1934.<ref name=\"langley\">Langley, 1983</ref> After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and [[Wall Street]] bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.<ref name=\"Schmidt231\" />\n\n====Honduras====\nIn 1903 Butler was stationed in [[Puerto Rico]] on [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra Island]]. Hearing rumors of a Honduran revolt, the United States government ordered his unit and a supporting naval detachment to sail to Honduras, {{convert|1500|mi|0|sp=us}} to the west, to defend the [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|U.S. Consulate]] there. Using a converted banana boat renamed the ''Panther'', Butler and several hundred Marines landed at the port town of [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s]]. In a letter home, he described the action: they were \"prepared to land and shoot everybody and everything that was breaking the peace\",<ref name=\"Schmidt28-32\">Schmidt, 1998, pp. 28\u201332</ref> but instead found a quiet town. The Marines re-boarded the ''Panther'' and continued up the coast line, looking for rebels at several towns, but found none.\n\nWhen they arrived at [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]], however, they heard gunfire, and came upon a battle in progress that had been waged for 55 hours between rebels called ''Bonillista'' and Honduran government soldiers at a local fort. At the sight of the Marines, the fighting ceased and Butler led a detachment of Marines to the American consulate, where he found the consul, wrapped in an American flag, hiding among the floor beams. As soon as the Marines left the area with the shaken consul, the battle resumed and the Bonillistas soon controlled the government.<ref name=\"Schmidt28-32\" /> During this expedition Butler earned the first of his nicknames, \"Old Gimlet Eye\". It was attributed to his feverish, bloodshot eyes\u2014he was suffering from some unnamed tropical fever at the time\u2014that enhanced his penetrating and bellicose stare.<ref name=\"Schmidt50\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 50</ref>\n\n====Marriage and business====\nAfter the Honduran campaign Butler returned to Philadelphia. He married Ethel Conway Peters of Philadelphia in [[Bay Head, New Jersey]], a daughter of civil engineer and railroad executive [[Richard Peters (clubman)|Richard Peters]], on June 30, 1905.<ref>{{cite news|title=Butler\u2212Peters|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/07/01/101705904.pdf|accessdate=October 9, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 1, 1905}}</ref> His best man at the wedding was his former commanding officer in China, Lt. Col. [[Littleton Waller]].<ref name=\"Schmidt39\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 39</ref> The couple eventually had three children: a daughter, Ethel Peters Butler (Mrs. John Wehle), and two sons, Smedley Darlington Jr. and Thomas Richard.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Smedley Butler|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1962/06/16/102999712.pdf|accessdate=October 9, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 16, 1962}}</ref>\n\nButler was next assigned to garrison duty in the [[Philippines]], where he once launched a resupply mission across the stormy waters of [[Subic Bay]] after his isolated outpost ran out of rations. In 1908 he was diagnosed as having a nervous breakdown and received nine months sick leave, which he spent at home. He successfully managed a coal mine in [[West Virginia]], but returned to active duty in the Marine Corps at the first opportunity.<ref name=boot144>Boot, 2003, p. 144</ref>\n\n====Central America====\nFrom 1909 to 1912 Butler served in [[Nicaragua]] enforcing U.S. policy. With a 104-degree fever he led his battalion to the relief of a rebel-besieged city, [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]]. In December 1909 he commanded the [[3rd Battalion 1st Marines|3d Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment]] on the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. On August 11, 1912, he was temporarily detached to command an expeditionary battalion he led in the [[Battle of Masaya]] on September 19, 1912, and the bombardment, assault and capture of [[Coyotepe Hill]], Nicaragua, in October 1912. He remained in Nicaragua until November 1912, when he rejoined the Marines of [[3rd Battalion 1st Marines|3d Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment]], at [[Camp Elliott]], Panama.<ref name=\"WhosWho\" />\n\n====Veracruz, Mexico, and first Medal of Honor====\n[[File:butlerveracruz.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Marine Officers at Veracruz. Front row, left to right: [[Wendell C. Neville]]; [[John A. Lejeune]]; Littleton W.T. Waller, Commanding; Smedley Butler|alt=Eight people in military uniforms. They are wearing hats and are standing in formation.]]\nButler and his family were living in Panama in January 1914 when he was ordered to report as the Marine officer of a battleship squadron massing off the coast of Mexico, near [[Veracruz]], to monitor a revolutionary movement. He did not like leaving his family and the home they had established in Panama and intended to request orders home as soon as he determined he was not needed.<ref name=\"Schmidt60-61\">Schmidt, 1998, pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nOn March 1, 1914, Butler and Navy Lt. (later Adm.) [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Frank J. Fletcher]] (not to be confused with his uncle, who was then Rear Adm. [[Frank Friday Fletcher|Frank F. Fletcher]]) \"went ashore at Veracruz, where they met the American superintendent of the Inter-Oceanic Railway and surreptitiously rode in his private car [a railway car] up the line 75 miles to [[Xalapa|Jalapa]] and back\".<ref name=\"Schmidt64w\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 64</ref> A purpose of the trip was to allow Butler and Fletcher to discuss the details of a future expedition into Mexico. Fletcher's plan required Butler to make his way into the country and develop a more detailed invasion plan while inside its borders. It was a spy mission and Butler was enthusiastic to get started. When Adm. Fletcher explained the plan to the commanders in Washington, DC, they agreed to it. Butler was given the go-ahead.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nA few days later he set out by train on his spy mission to Mexico City, with a stopover at Puebla. He made his way to the U.S. Consulate in [[Mexico City]], posing as a railroad official named \"Mr. Johnson\".\n* ''March 5''. As I was reading last night, waiting for dinner to be served, a visitant, rather than a visitor, appeared in my drawing-room ''incognito'' \u2013 a simple \"Mr. Johnson,\" eager, intrepid, dynamic, efficient, unshaven! * * *<ref name=\"O'Shaughnessy\">Edith O'Shaughnessy, ''A Diplomat's Wife in Mexico'' (Harper & Brothers, 1916) p. 212</ref>\n\nHe and the chief railroad inspector scoured the city, saying they were searching for a lost railroad employee; there was no lost employee, and in fact the employee they said was lost never existed. The ruse gave Butler access to various areas of the city. In the process of the so-called search, they located weapons in use by the Mexican army and determined the size of units and states of readiness. They updated maps and verified the railroad lines for use in an impending US invasion.<ref name=\"Schmidt64-65\">Schmidt, 1998, pp. 64\u201365</ref>\n\nOn March 7, 1914, he returned to Veracruz with the information he had gathered and presented it to his commanders. The invasion plan was eventually scrapped when authorities loyal to Mexican Gen. [[Victoriano Huerta]] detained a small American naval landing party (that had gone ashore to buy gasoline) in [[Tampico, Mexico]], which led to what became known as the [[Tampico Affair]].<ref name=\"Schmidt67-68\">Schmidt, 1998, pp. 67\u201368</ref>\n\nWhen President [[Woodrow Wilson]] discovered that an arms shipment was about to arrive in Mexico, he sent a contingent of Marines and sailors to Veracruz to intercept it on April 21, 1914. Over the next few days street fighting and sniper fire posed a threat to Butler's force, but a door-to-door search rooted out most of the resistance. By April 26 the landing force of 5,800 Marines and sailors secured the city, which they held for the next six months. By the end of the conflict the Americans reported 17 dead and 63 wounded and the Mexican forces had 126 dead and 195 wounded. After the actions at Veracruz, the US decided to minimize the bloodshed and changed their plans from a full invasion of Mexico to simply [[United States occupation of Veracruz|maintaining the city of Veracruz]].<ref name=\"Schmidt68-70\">Schmidt, 1998, pp. 68\u201370</ref> For his actions on April 22, Butler was awarded his first Medal of Honor.<ref name=\"WhosWho\" /><ref name=Militarytimes /> The citation reads: {{quote|For distinguished conduct in battle, engagement of Vera Cruz, 22 April 1914. Major Butler was eminent and conspicuous in command of his battalion. He exhibited courage and skill in leading his men through the action of the 22d and in the final occupation of the city.<ref name=Militarytimes />}}\n\nAfter the occupation of Veracruz, many military personnel received the Medal of Honor, an unusually high number that somewhat diminished the prestige of the award. The army presented one, nine went to Marines and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I Butler, then a [[Major (United States)|major]], attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing to deserve it. The medal was returned to him with orders to keep it and to wear it as well.<ref name=AboveAndBeyond114>{{cite book |title=Above and Beyond, A History of the Medal of Honor from the Civil War to Vietnam |page=[https://archive.org/details/abovebeyondhist00bost/page/113 113] |author=Editors of the Boston Publishing Company |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-8094-5628-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/abovebeyondhist00bost/page/113 }}</ref>\n\n====Haiti and second Medal of Honor====\nIn 1915 Haitian President [[Vilbrun Guillaume Sam]] was killed by a mob. In response, the United States ordered the {{USS|Connecticut|BB-18|6}} to Haiti with Maj. Butler and a group of Marines on board. On October 24, 1915, an estimated 400 ''Cacos'' [[Battle of Fort Dipitie|ambushed]] Butler's patrol of 44 mounted Marines when they approached [[Fort Dipitie]]. Surrounded by ''Cacos'', the Marines maintained their perimeter throughout the night. The next morning they charged the much larger enemy force by breaking out in three directions. The startled Haitians fled.<ref name=\"Schmidt80\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 80</ref> In early November Butler and a force of 700 Marines and sailors returned to the mountains to clear the area. At their temporary headquarters base at Le Trou they fought off an attack by about 100 ''Cacos''. After the Americans took several other forts and ramparts during the following days, only [[Fort Rivi\u00e8re]], an old French-built stronghold atop [[Montagne Noire]], was left.<ref name=\"Schmidt80\" />\n\nFor the operation Butler was given three companies of Marines and some sailors from the USS ''Connecticut'', about 100 men. They encircled the fort and gradually closed in on it. Butler reached the fort from the southern side with the 15th Company and found a small opening in the wall. The Marines entered through the opening and engaged the ''Cacos'' in hand-to-hand combat. Butler and the Marines took the rebel stronghold on November 17, an action for which he received his second Medal of Honor, as well as the Haitian Medal of Honor.<ref name=Militarytimes>{{Hall of Valor|2879|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}</ref> The entire battle lasted less than 20 minutes.

The camp had been unsanitary, overcrowded and disorganized. [[U.S. Secretary of War]] [[Newton Baker]] sent novelist [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]] to report on the camp. She later described how Butler tackled the sanitation problems. He began by solving the problem of mud: \"[T]he ground under the tents was nothing but mud, [so] he had raided the wharf at Brest of the [[duckboards]] no longer needed for the trenches, carted the first one himself up that four-mile hill to the camp, and thus provided something in the way of protection for the men to sleep on.\"<ref name=\"letters\" /> [[General officer|Gen.]] [[John J.

At Quantico he transformed the wartime training camp into a permanent Marine post. He directed the Quantico camp's growth until it became the \"showplace\" of the Corps.<ref name=\"Ward\">Ward</ref> Butler won national attention by taking thousands of his men on long field marches, many of which he led from the front, to Gettysburg and other [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battle sites, where they conducted large-scale re-enactments before crowds of distinguished spectators.<ref name=\"Ward\" />\n\nDuring a training exercise in western Virginia in 1921, he was told by a local farmer that [[Stonewall Jackson]]'s arm was buried nearby, to which he replied, \"Bosh!

Freeland Kendrick]] asked President [[Calvin Coolidge]] to loan the City a military general to help him rid [[Philadelphia's municipal government]] of crime and corruption. At the urging of Butler's father,<ref name=mlb/> Coolidge authorized Butler to take the necessary leave from the Corps to serve as Philadelphia's director of public safety in charge of running the city's police and fire departments from January 1924 until December 1925.<ref name=\"WhosWho\" /> He began his new job by assembling all 4,000 of the city police into the Metropolitan Opera House in shifts to introduce himself and inform them that things would change while he was in charge. Since he had not been given authority to fire corrupt police officers, he switched entire units from one part of the city to another,<ref name=mlb/> to undermine local protection rackets and profiteering.<ref name=\"Schmidt146\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 146</ref><ref name=\"Schmidt147\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 147</ref>\n\nWithin 48 hours of taking over Butler organized raids on more than 900 [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]], ordering them padlocked and, in many cases, destroyed. In addition to raiding the speakeasies, he also attempted to eliminate other illegal activities: bootlegging, prostitution, gambling and police corruption. More zealous than he was political, he ordered crackdowns on the social elite's favorite hangouts, such as the [[Ritz-Carlton]] and the [[Union League]], as well as on drinking establishments that served the working class.<ref name=\"MarineCorps\">{{cite journal |title=Leatherneck legends; Swapping some sea stories at the birthday ball? Here are 8 of the Corps' best |journal=Marine Corps Times |date=November 15, 2004|pages=22}}</ref> Although he was effective in reducing crime and police corruption, he was a controversial leader. In one instance he made a statement that he would promote the first officer to kill a bandit and stated, \"I don't believe there is a single bandit notch on a policeman's guns {{Sic}} in this city; go out and get some.\"<ref name=\"Schmidt146\" /> Although many of the local citizens and police felt that the raids were just a show, they continued for several weeks.<ref name=\"Schmidt147\" />\n\nHe implemented programs to improve city safety and security. He established policies and guidelines of administration and developed a Philadelphia police uniform that resembled that of the Marine Corps.<ref name=\"Schmidt148\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 148</ref> Other changes included military-style checkpoints into the city, bandit-chasing squads armed with [[sawed-off shotgun]]s and armored police cars.<ref name=\"Schmidt148\" /> The press began reporting on the good and the bad aspects of Butler's personal war on crime. The reports praised the new uniforms, the new programs and the reductions in crime but they also reflected the public's negative opinion of their new Public Safety Director. Many felt that he was being too aggressive in his tactics and resented the reductions in their civil rights, such as the stopping of citizens at the city checkpoints. Butler frequently swore in his radio addresses, causing many citizens to suggest his behavior, particularly his language, was inappropriate for someone of his rank and stature.<ref name=\"Schmidt149\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 149</ref> Some even suggested Butler acted like a military dictator, even charging that he wrongfully used active-duty Marines in some of his raids.<ref name=\"Schmidt149\" /> Maj. R.A. Haynes, the federal Prohibition commissioner, visited the city in 1924, six months after Butler was appointed. He announced that \"great progress\"<ref name=\"Schmidt150\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 150</ref> had been made in the city and attributed that success to Butler.<ref name=\"Schmidt150\" />\n\nEventually Butler's leadership style and the directness of actions undermined his support within the community. His departure seemed imminent. Mayor Kendrick reported to the press, \"I had the guts to bring General Butler to Philadelphia and I have the guts to fire him.\"<ref name=\"Schmidt153\">Schmidt, 1998, p. 153</ref> Feeling that his duties in Philadelphia were coming to an end, Butler contacted Gen. Lejeune to prepare for his return to the Marine Corps. Not all of the city felt he was doing a bad job, though, and when the news started to leak that he would be leaving, people began to gather at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]]. A group of 4,000 supporters assembled and negotiated a truce between him and the mayor to keep him in Philadelphia for a while longer, and the president authorized a one-year extension.<ref name=\"Schmidt153-4\">Schmidt, 1998, pp. 153\u20134</ref>\n\nButler devoted much of his second year to executing arrest warrants, cracking down on crooked police and enforcing prohibition. On January 1, 1926, his leave from the Marine Corps ended and the president declined a request for a second extension. Butler received orders to report to [[San Diego]] and prepared his family and his belongings for the new assignment.<ref name=\"Schmidt154-5\">Schmidt, 1998, pp. 154\u20135</ref> In light of his pending departure, he began to defy the mayor and other key city officials.

While there, he cleverly parlayed his influence among various generals and warlords to the protection of U.S. interests, ultimately winning the public acclaim of contending Chinese leaders. When he returned to the United States in 1929 he was promoted to major general, becoming, at age 48, the youngest major general of the Marine Corps.

The outspokenness that characterized his run-ins with the mayor of Philadelphia, the \"unreliability\" mentioned by his superiors when opposing a posting to the Western Front and his comments about [[Benito Mussolini]] resurfaced. In the end the position of commandant went to Fuller, who had more years of commissioned service than Butler and was considered less controversial.

Veterans of World War I, many of whom had been out of work since the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], sought immediate cash payment of Service Certificates granted to them eight years earlier via the [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act]] of 1924. Each Service Certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment, plus [[compound interest]]. The problem was that the certificates (like bonds), matured 20 years from the date of original issuance, thus, under extant law, the Service Certificates could not be redeemed until 1945. In June 1932, approximately 43,000 marchers\u201417,000 of whom were World War I veterans, their families, and affiliated groups\u2014protested in Washington, D.C.<ref name=FBI>{{cite web |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |url=http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/bonmarch.htm |title=Bonus March |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208194024/http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/bonmarch.htm <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=February 8, 2010}}</ref> The Bonus Expeditionary Force, also known as the \"[[Bonus Army]]\", marched on Washington to advocate the passage of the \"soldier's bonus\" for service during World War I.

The motion, known as the [[Wright Patman|Patman]] bill, was decisively defeated, but the veterans stayed in their camp. On July 19 Butler arrived with his young son Thomas, the day before the official eviction by the Hoover administration. He walked through the camp and spoke to the veterans; he told them that they were fine soldiers and they had a right to lobby Congress just as much as any corporation. He and his son spent the night and ate with the men, and in the morning Butler gave a speech to the camping veterans.

MacGuire told him that a group of businessmen, supposedly backed by a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler had been asked to lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with [[Grayson M.P. Murphy|Grayson M\u2013P Murphy]] & Co. The ''New York Times'' reported that Butler had told friends that General [[Hugh S. Johnson]], former head of the [[National Recovery Administration]], was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler told Congress that MacGuire had told him the attempted coup was backed by three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to be assembled in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties alleged to be involved publicly said there was no truth in the story, calling it a joke and a fantasy.<ref name=NYTNov21 />\n\nIn its report to the House, the committee stated that, while \"no evidence was presented... to show a connection... with any fascist activity of any European country... [t]here was no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution...\" and that \"your committee was able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Butler, with the exception of the direct statement about the creation of the organisation.  This, however, was corroborated in the correspondence of MacGuire with his principal, Robert Sterling Clark....\"<ref name=\"Archer2007\">{{cite book|title=The Plot to Seize the White House|author=\"Archer, Jules|pages=192\u20133}}</ref>\n\nNo prosecutions or further investigations followed, and historians have questioned whether or not a coup was actually contemplated.
