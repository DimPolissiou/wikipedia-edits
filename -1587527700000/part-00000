The episodes are in various genres, including [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], [[suspense]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], and [[psychological thriller]], often concluding with a [[macabre]] or [[Twist ending|unexpected twist]], and usually with a [[moral]]. A popular and critical success, it introduced many Americans to common science fiction and fantasy [[trope (literature)|trope]]s. [[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The original series]], shot entirely in [[black and white]], ran on [[CBS]] for five seasons from 1959 to 1964.\n\n''The Twilight Zone'' followed in the tradition of earlier television shows such as ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'' (1951\u201353)  and ''[[Science Fiction Theatre]]'' (1955\u201357); radio programs such as  ''[[The Weird Circle]]'' (1943\u201345), ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]'' (1950\u201351) and ''[[X Minus One]]'' (1955\u201358); and the radio work of one of Serling's inspirations, [[Norman Corwin]]. The success of the series led to [[Twilight Zone: The Movie|a feature film]] (1983), [[Twilight Zone: Rod Serling's Lost Classics|a TV film]] (1994), a [[The Twilight Zone (radio series)|radio series]] (2002\u201312), [[Twilight Zone literature|literature]] including a [[comic book]], novels and a magazine and a [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|theme park attraction]] and various other [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s that spanned five decades, including three revival television series. The [[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|first revival]] (1985\u201389) ran on CBS and in syndication in the 1980s, while the [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|second revival]] ran on [[UPN]] (2002\u20132003). In December 2017, [[CBS All Access]] officially ordered the [[The Twilight Zone (2019 TV series)|third ''Twilight Zone'' revival]] to series,  helmed by [[Jordan Peele]]. The series premiered on April 1, 2019.\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked the original TV series #5 in their 2013 list of the 60 greatest shows of all time and #4 in their list of the 60 greatest dramas.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Best Series of All Time|date=23 December 2013|website=tvguide.com|access-date=2017-10-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003105507/http://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/|archive-date=2016-10-03|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>Roush, Matt (February 25, 2013). \"Showstoppers: The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time\". ''[[TV Guide]]''. pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\n== Television history ==\n\n===Background===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}\nAs a boy, Rod Serling was a fan of [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] stories.  As an adult, he sought topics with themes such as [[racism]], [[government]], [[war]], [[society]], and human nature in general. Serling decided to combine these two interests as a way to broach these subjects on television at a time when such issues were not commonly addressed.<ref>\n{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/12/how-em-the-twilight-zone-em-predicted-our-paranoid-present/282700/|title=How The Twilight Zone Predicted Our Paranoid Present|last=LaFrance|first=Adrienne|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811183518/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/12/how-em-the-twilight-zone-em-predicted-our-paranoid-present/282700/|archive-date=2017-08-11|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nThroughout the [[1950s in television|1950s]], Serling established himself as one of the most popular names in television. He was as famous for writing televised drama as he was for criticizing the medium's limitations. His most vocal complaints concerned censorship, which was frequently practiced by sponsors and networks. \"I was not permitted to have my senators discuss any current or pressing problem,\" he said of his 1957 ''[[Studio One (U.S. TV series)|Studio One]]'' production \"The Arena\", intended to be an involving look into contemporary politics. \"To talk of tariff was to align oneself with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]; to talk of labor was to suggest control by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. To say a single thing germane to the current political scene was absolutely prohibited.\"\n\n=== \"The Time Element\" (1958) ===\n[[CBS]] purchased a [[teleplay]] in 1958 that writer Rod Serling hoped to produce as the pilot of a weekly anthology series. \"The Time Element\" marked Serling's first entry in the field of science fiction.\n\n====Plot====\nSeveral years after the end of World War II, a man named Peter Jenson ([[William Bendix]]) visits a [[psychoanalyst]], Dr. Gillespie ([[Martin Balsam]]). Jenson tells him about a recurring dream in which he tries to warn people about the \"sneak attack\" on Pearl Harbor before it happens, but the warnings are disregarded. Jenson believes the events of the dream are real, and each night he travels back to 1941. Dr. Gillespie insists that time travel is impossible given the nature of [[temporal paradox]]es. While on the couch, Jenson falls asleep once again but this time dreams that the Japanese planes shoot and kill him. In Dr. Gillespie's office, the couch Jenson was lying on is now empty. Dr. Gillespie goes to a bar where he finds Jenson's picture on the wall. The bartender tells him that Jenson had tended bar there, but he was killed during the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\n[[File:Time20.jpg|thumb|[[William Bendix]] and [[Martin Balsam]] in \"The Time Element\"]]\n\n====Production====\nWith the \"Time Element\" script, Serling drafted the fundamental elements that defined the subsequent series: a science-fiction/fantasy theme, opening and closing narration, and an ending with a twist. \"The Time Element\" was purchased immediately, but shelved indefinitely.\n\nThis is where things stood when [[Bert Granet]], the new producer for ''[[Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse]]'', discovered \"The Time Element\" in CBS' vaults while searching for an original Serling script to add prestige to his show. \"The Time Element\" (introduced by [[Desi Arnaz]]) debuted on November 24, 1958, to an overwhelmingly delighted audience of television coochies and critics alike. \"The humor and sincerity of Mr. Serling's dialogue made 'The Time Element' consistently entertaining,\" offered [[Jack Gould]] of ''[[The New York Times]]''. Over 6,000 letters of praise flooded Granet's offices. Convinced that a series based on such stories could succeed, CBS again began talks with Serling about the possibilities of producing ''The Twilight Zone''. \"[[Where Is Everybody?]]\" was accepted as the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] and the project was officially announced to the public in early 1959.  Other than reruns at the time \"The Time Element\" was not aired on television again until it was shown as part of a 1996 all-night sneak preview of the new cable channel [[TVLand]]. It is available in an Italian [[DVD]] boxed set titled ''Ai confini della realt\u00e0 \u2013 I tesori perduti''.  The ''Twilight Zone Season 1'' [[Blu-ray]] boxed set released on September 14, 2010, offers a remastered high-definition version of the original ''Desilu Playhouse'' production as a special feature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Twilight-Zone-Season-1-Press-Release/13986 |title=The Twilight Zone DVD news: Official Season 1 Press Release |work=TVShowsOnDVD.com |accessdate=2013-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015182535/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Twilight-Zone-Season-1-Press-Release/13986 |archivedate=2012-10-15 }}</ref>\n\n=== Original series (1959\u20131964) ===\n{{Main|The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)}}\n\n[[File:Rod Serling dictating script 1959.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rod Serling]] working on his script with a dictating machine, 1959]]\nThe series was produced by Cayuga Productions, Inc., a production company owned and named by Serling. It reflects his background in Central New York State and is named after Cayuga Lake, on which he owned a home, and where Cornell University and Ithaca College are located.\n\nAside from Serling, who wrote or adapted nearly two-thirds of the series' total episodes, writers for ''The Twilight Zone'' included leading authors such as [[Charles Beaumont]], [[Ray Bradbury]],<ref>\n{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/59288/8-bizarre-facts-about-rod-serling-and-twilight-zone|title=8 Bizarre Facts About Rod Serling and ''The Twilight Zone''|date=2014-10-08|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808105412/http://mentalfloss.com/article/59288/8-bizarre-facts-about-rod-serling-and-twilight-zone|archive-date=2017-08-08|url-status=live}}\n</ref> [[Earl Hamner, Jr.]], [[George Clayton Johnson]], [[Richard Matheson]], [[Reginald Rose]], and [[Jerry Sohl]]. Many episodes also featured new adaptations of classic stories by such writers as [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[Jerome Bixby]], [[Damon Knight]], [[John Collier (fiction writer)|John Collier]], and [[Lewis Padgett]].\n\n''Twilight Zone''{{'s}} writers frequently used science fiction as a vehicle for social comment, as networks and sponsors who censored controversial material from live dramas were less concerned with seemingly innocuous fantasy and sci-fi stories. Frequent themes on ''The Twilight Zone'' included [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], [[McCarthyism]], and [[mass hysteria]], subjects that were avoided on less serious primetime television. Episodes such as \"[[The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street]]\" and \"[[I Am the Night\u2014Color Me Black]]\" offered specific commentary on current events and social issues. Other stories, such as \"[[The Masks (The Twilight Zone)|The Masks]]\", \"[[I Dream of Genie]]\", or \"[[Mr. Denton on Doomsday]]\" were [[allegories]], [[parables]], or [[fables]] that reflected the moral and philosophical choices of the characters.\n\nDespite his esteem in the writing community, Serling found the series difficult to sell. Few critics felt that science fiction could transcend empty escapism and enter the realm of adult drama. In a September 22, 1959, interview with Serling, [[Mike Wallace]] asked a question illustrative of the times: \"...[Y]ou're going to be, obviously, working so hard on ''The Twilight Zone'' that, in essence, for the time being and for the foreseeable future, you've given up on writing anything important for television, right?\" While Serling's appearances on the show became one of its most distinctive features, with his clipped delivery still widely imitated today, he was reportedly nervous about it and had to be persuaded to appear on camera. Serling often steps into the middle of the action while the characters remain oblivious to him, but on one notable occasion, they are aware of his presence: In the episode \"[[A World of His Own]]\", a writer ([[Keenan Wynn]]) with the power to alter his reality objects to Serling's narration and promptly erases Serling from the show.\n\nIn season two, due to budgetary constraints, the network decided \u2013 against Serling's wishes \u2013 to cut costs by shooting some episodes on [[videotape]] rather than film. The requisite multicamera setup of the videotape format precluded location shooting, severely limiting the potential scope of the storylines, and the experiment was abandoned after just six episodes (\"[[Twenty Two (The Twilight Zone)|Twenty Two]]\", \"[[Static (The Twilight Zone)|Static]]\", \"[[The Whole Truth (The Twilight Zone)|The Whole Truth]]\", \"[[The Lateness of the Hour]]\", \"[[The Night of the Meek]]\", and \"[[Long Distance Call]]\").\n\nThe original series contains 156 episodes. The episodes in seasons one through three are 30 minutes long with commercials (24 or 25 minutes without commercials). Season four (1962\u201363) consists of one-hour episodes with commercials (51 minutes without commercials). Season five returned to the half-hour format.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Twilight Zone|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052520/|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\n===First revival (1985\u20131989)===\n{{Main|The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)}}\nIt was Serling's decision to sell his share of the series back to the network that eventually allowed for a ''Twilight Zone'' revival. As an in-house production, CBS stood to earn more money producing ''The Twilight Zone'' than it could by purchasing a new series produced by an outside company. Even so, the network was slow to consider a revival, turning down offers from the original production team of Rod Serling and [[Buck Houghton]] and later from American filmmaker [[Francis Ford Coppola]].\n\nCBS gave the new ''Twilight Zone'' a [[greenlight]] in 1984 under the supervision of Carla Singer, then Vice President of Drama Development. While the show did not come close to matching the enduring popularity of the original, some episodes \u2013 particularly [[Alan Brennert]]'s love story \"[[Her Pilgrim Soul]]\" and [[J. Neil Schulman]]'s \"[[Profile in Silver]]\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0734727/reviews|title=\"The Twilight Zone\" Profile in Silver/Button, Button (TV Episode 1986)|author=|date=|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}{{unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0734727/ratings|title=\"The Twilight Zone\" Profile in Silver/Button, Button (TV Episode 1986)|author=|date=|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}{{unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}</ref> \u2013 were critically acclaimed. In a tribute to the original series, the opening credits include a brief image of Rod Serling. Four episodes are remakes of those from the original series: \"[[Night of the Meek]]\", \"[[Shadow Play (The Twilight Zone, 1985)|Shadow Play]]\", \"[[The After Hours (1986 The Twilight Zone)|The After Hours]]\" and \"[[A Game of Pool (The Twilight Zone, 1985)|A Game of Pool]]\", while \"[[Dead Woman's Shoes]]\" is an adaptation of \"[[Dead Man's Shoes (The Twilight Zone)|Dead Man's Shoes]]\". Unlike the original series and the second revival, this series does not include the opening monologue during the title sequence. As well, the narration is all strictly voice-over and the narrator never appears on-screen.\n\n===''Rod Serling's Lost Classics'' (1994)===\n{{Main|Rod Serling's Lost Classics}}\nIn the early 1990s, [[Richard Matheson]] and Carol Serling produced an outline for a two-hour made-for-TV movie which would feature Matheson adaptations of three yet-unfilmed Rod Serling short stories. Outlines for such a production were rejected by CBS until early 1994, when Serling's widow discovered a complete shooting script (\"Where the Dead Are\") authored by her late husband, while rummaging through their garage. She showed the forgotten script to producers Michael O'Hara and Laurence Horowitz, who were significantly impressed by it. \"I had a pile of scripts, which I usually procrastinate about reading. But I read this one right away and, after 30 pages, called my partner and said, \"I love it,\" recalled O'Hara. \"This is pure imagination, a period piece, literate \u2013 some might say wordy. If Rod Serling's name weren't on it, it wouldn't have a chance at getting made.\"\n\nEager to capitalize on Serling's celebrity status as a writer, CBS packaged \"Where the Dead Are\" with Matheson's adaptation of \"The Theatre\", debuting as a two-hour feature on the night of May 19, 1994, under the name ''Twilight Zone: Rod Serling's Lost Classics''. The title represents a misnomer, as both stories were conceived long after ''Twilight Zone's'' cancellation. Written just months before Serling's death, \"Where the Dead Are\" starred [[Patrick Bergin]] as a 19th-century doctor who stumbles upon a [[mad scientist]]'s medical experiments with immortality. \"The Theatre\" starred [[Amy Irving]] and [[Gary Cole]] as a couple who visits a cineplex where they discover the feature presentation depicts their own lives. [[James Earl Jones]] provided opening and closing narrations.\n\nCritical response was mixed. [[Gannett News Service]] described it as \"taut and stylish, a reminder of what can happen when fine actors are given great words.\" ''[[USA Today]]'' was less impressed, even suggesting that Carol Serling \"should have left these two unproduced mediocrities in the garage where she found them.\" Ultimately, ratings proved insufficient to justify a proposed sequel featuring three scripts adapted by Matheson.\n\n===Second revival (2002\u20132003)===\n{{Main|The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)}}\n\nA second revival was developed by [[UPN]] in 2002, it was hosted by [[Forest Whitaker]]. It was broadcast in a one-hour format composed of two half-hour stories, it was canceled after one season. \"[[It's Still a Good Life]]\" is a sequel to \"[[It's a Good Life (The Twilight Zone)|It's a Good Life]]\", \"[[The Monsters Are on Maple Street]]\" is an adaptation of \"[[The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street]]\" and \"[[Eye of the Beholder (2003 The Twilight Zone episode)|Eye of the Beholder]]\" is a remake of [[Eye of the Beholder (1960 Twilight Zone episode)|an episode from the original series]], with Serling still credited as writer.\n\n===Third revival (2019\u2013present)===\n{{Main|The Twilight Zone (2019 TV series)}}\nIn December 2012, it was reported that [[Bryan Singer]] was developing and executive producing a third revival television series for [[CBS Television Studios]]. A writer for the series was not chosen and the program was not pitched to any networks. CBS, which broadcast the original series and first revival, was reportedly interested.<ref>\n{{Cite news|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/12/bryan-singer-to-spearhead-twilight-zone-series-reboot-for-cbs-tv-studios/|title=Bryan Singer To Spearhead \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 Series Reboot For CBS TV Studios|work=Deadline|date=2012-12-19|accessdate=2012-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231003924/http://www.deadline.com/2012/12/bryan-singer-to-spearhead-twilight-zone-series-reboot-for-cbs-tv-studios/|archive-date=2012-12-31|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2012/1220/singerb.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130218002308/http://www.rte.ie/ten/2012/1220/singerb.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-02-18|title=Singer leads Twilight Zone reboot|date=2012-12-20|accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref><ref>\n{{Cite news|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/19/bryan-singer-developing-new-tv-version-of-the-twilight-zone|title=Bryan Singer Developing New TV Version of The Twilight Zone|work=[[IGN]]|date=2012-12-19|accessdate=2012-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222001203/http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/19/bryan-singer-developing-new-tv-version-of-the-twilight-zone|archive-date=2012-12-22|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/twilight-zone-bryan-singer-405478|title=X-Men's' Bryan Singer Prepping 'Twilight Zone' Reboot|date=2012-12-19|accessdate=2012-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231020705/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/twilight-zone-bryan-singer-405478|archive-date=2012-12-31|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite news|url=https://screenrant.com/twilight-zone-cbs-bryan-singer/|title=Bryan Singer Developing New \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 Series For CBS|date=2012-12-19|accessdate=2012-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223075247/http://screenrant.com/twilight-zone-cbs-bryan-singer/|archive-date=2012-12-23|url-status=live}}\n</ref> In February 2013, Singer told ''TG Daily'' that the project was still in development and that he hoped to direct the pilot and have [[A-list]] actors appear on the revival.<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Bryan Singer Hoping for an A-list cast for his Twilight Zone show|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/bryan-singer-breaks-his-silence-on-man-of-steel|work=[[Total Film]]|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=August 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825115419/http://www.totalfilm.com/news/bryan-singer-breaks-his-silence-on-man-of-steel|archive-date=2013-08-25|url-status=live}}\n</ref> The following month, he told ''[[IGN]]'' that a writer with whom he had previously worked was in negotiations to join the revival and that he felt \"passionate\" towards the original series and the planned revival.<ref>\n{{cite web|last=Cornet|first=Roth|title=What\u2019s Happening with Bryan Singer\u2019s Planned Twilight Zone Series Reboot?|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/08/whats-happening-with-bryan-singers-planned-twilight-zone-reboot-series|accessdate=August 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715212102/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/08/whats-happening-with-bryan-singers-planned-twilight-zone-reboot-series|archive-date=2013-07-15|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nIn February 2016, it was reported that [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]] would write and direct the pilot episode of the revival series.

The script for \"[[The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street]]\" has been published into 7th grade reading books in the form of a play.\n\n===Stage productions===\nLive theatre productions of the original episodes can be seen in Los Angeles and Seattle, where Theater Schmeater has continuously produced a late night series, \"The Twilight Zone \u2013 Live\" with permission of the Serling estate, since 1996. In 2009, [[Masquerade (Theatre Group)|Masquerade]], A [[Chennai]] based theater group produced 'Dystopia', loosely based on the episodes \"[[The Obsolete Man]]\" and \"[[Five Characters in Search of an Exit]]\".<ref>\n{{cite news | url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/09/02/stories/2009090250110100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Play time, folks! | date=2009-09-02 | access-date=2010-08-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413125450/http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/09/02/stories/2009090250110100.htm | archive-date=2014-04-13 | url-status=live }}\n</ref> In 2011, the [[Penn State University]] theatre group, No Refund Theatre, produced a stage adaptation of ''The Twilight Zone''.

Designed by [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], the attraction is present at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] in [[Orlando]], [[Walt Disney Studios Park]] in [[Paris]] and [[Tokyo DisneySea]] in [[Japan]]. A fourth attraction at [[Disney California Adventure]] operated from 2004 to 2017 before being re-themed to [[Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 Mission: Breakout!]]. The attraction in Japan is the only one not themed to ''The Twilight Zone'', due to cultural differences and constraints in licensing for the [[Oriental Land Company]], owner and operator of the Tokyo parks. The ride also served as the inspiration for the 1997 TV film ''[[Tower of Terror (1997 film)|Tower of Terror]]'', which bears no connection to the attraction or ''The Twilight Zone''.\n\n===Syndication===\n''The Twilight Zone'' original series is currently in syndication on [[MeTV]] Network<ref>\nMeTV Network Schedule http://metv.com/shows/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618183006/http://www.metv.com/shows |date=2016-06-18 }}\n</ref> and [[Syfy]], and the 2002 revival is syndicated on the [[El Rey Network]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{in popular culture|section|date= November 2018}}\nDuring the 1980s the British food company, [[Jacob's|Jacobs]], ran a [[TV advertisement]] for one of its products - a type of biscuit called [[Twiglets]].

The episodes are in various genres, including [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], [[suspense]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], and [[psychological thriller]], often concluding with a [[macabre]] or [[Twist ending|unexpected twist]], and usually with a [[moral]]. A popular and critical success, it introduced many Americans to common science fiction and fantasy [[trope (literature)|trope]]s. [[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The original series]], shot entirely in [[black and white]], ran on [[CBS]] for five seasons from 1959 to 1964.\n\n''The Twilight Zone'' followed in the tradition of earlier television shows such as ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'' (1951\u201353)  and ''[[Science Fiction Theatre]]'' (1955\u201357); radio programs such as  ''[[The Weird Circle]]'' (1943\u201345), ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]'' (1950\u201351) and ''[[X Minus One]]'' (1955\u201358); and the radio work of one of Serling's inspirations, [[Norman Corwin]]. The success of the series led to [[Twilight Zone: The Movie|a feature film]] (1983), [[Twilight Zone: Rod Serling's Lost Classics|a TV film]] (1994), a [[The Twilight Zone (radio series)|radio series]] (2002\u201312), [[Twilight Zone literature|literature]] including a [[comic book]], novels and a magazine and a [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|theme park attraction]] and various other [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s that spanned five decades, including three revival television series. The [[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|first revival]] (1985\u201389) ran on CBS and in syndication in the 1980s, while the [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|second revival]] ran on [[UPN]] (2002\u20132003). In December 2017, [[CBS All Access]] officially ordered the [[The Twilight Zone (2019 TV series)|third ''Twilight Zone'' revival]] to series,  helmed by [[Jordan Peele]]. The series premiered on April 1, 2019.\n\n''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked the original TV series #5 in their 2013 list of the 60 greatest shows of all time and #4 in their list of the 60 greatest dramas.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Best Series of All Time|date=23 December 2013|website=tvguide.com|access-date=2017-10-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003105507/http://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/|archive-date=2016-10-03|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>Roush, Matt (February 25, 2013). \"Showstoppers: The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time\".

As an adult, he sought topics with themes such as [[racism]], [[government]], [[war]], [[society]], and human nature in general. Serling decided to combine these two interests as a way to broach these subjects on television at a time when such issues were not commonly addressed.<ref>\n{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/12/how-em-the-twilight-zone-em-predicted-our-paranoid-present/282700/|title=How The Twilight Zone Predicted Our Paranoid Present|last=LaFrance|first=Adrienne|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811183518/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/12/how-em-the-twilight-zone-em-predicted-our-paranoid-present/282700/|archive-date=2017-08-11|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nThroughout the [[1950s in television|1950s]], Serling established himself as one of the most popular names in television. He was as famous for writing televised drama as he was for criticizing the medium's limitations. His most vocal complaints concerned censorship, which was frequently practiced by sponsors and networks. \"I was not permitted to have my senators discuss any current or pressing problem,\" he said of his 1957 ''[[Studio One (U.S. TV series)|Studio One]]'' production \"The Arena\", intended to be an involving look into contemporary politics. \"To talk of tariff was to align oneself with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]; to talk of labor was to suggest control by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. To say a single thing germane to the current political scene was absolutely prohibited.\"\n\n=== \"The Time Element\" (1958) ===\n[[CBS]] purchased a [[teleplay]] in 1958 that writer Rod Serling hoped to produce as the pilot of a weekly anthology series. \"The Time Element\" marked Serling's first entry in the field of science fiction.\n\n====Plot====\nSeveral years after the end of World War II, a man named Peter Jenson ([[William Bendix]]) visits a [[psychoanalyst]], Dr. Gillespie ([[Martin Balsam]]). Jenson tells him about a recurring dream in which he tries to warn people about the \"sneak attack\" on Pearl Harbor before it happens, but the warnings are disregarded. Jenson believes the events of the dream are real, and each night he travels back to 1941. Dr. Gillespie insists that time travel is impossible given the nature of [[temporal paradox]]es. While on the couch, Jenson falls asleep once again but this time dreams that the Japanese planes shoot and kill him. In Dr. Gillespie's office, the couch Jenson was lying on is now empty. Dr. Gillespie goes to a bar where he finds Jenson's picture on the wall. The bartender tells him that Jenson had tended bar there, but he was killed during the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\n[[File:Time20.jpg|thumb|[[William Bendix]] and [[Martin Balsam]] in \"The Time Element\"]]\n\n====Production====\nWith the \"Time Element\" script, Serling drafted the fundamental elements that defined the subsequent series: a science-fiction/fantasy theme, opening and closing narration, and an ending with a twist. \"The Time Element\" was purchased immediately, but shelved indefinitely.\n\nThis is where things stood when [[Bert Granet]], the new producer for ''[[Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse]]'', discovered \"The Time Element\" in CBS' vaults while searching for an original Serling script to add prestige to his show. \"The Time Element\" (introduced by [[Desi Arnaz]]) debuted on November 24, 1958, to an overwhelmingly delighted audience of television viewers and critics alike. \"The humor and sincerity of Mr. Serling's dialogue made 'The Time Element' consistently entertaining,\" offered [[Jack Gould]] of ''[[The New York Times]]''. Over 6,000 letters of praise flooded Granet's offices. Convinced that a series based on such stories could succeed, CBS again began talks with Serling about the possibilities of producing ''The Twilight Zone''. \"[[Where Is Everybody?]]\" was accepted as the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] and the project was officially announced to the public in early 1959.  Other than reruns at the time \"The Time Element\" was not aired on television again until it was shown as part of a 1996 all-night sneak preview of the new cable channel [[TVLand]]. It is available in an Italian [[DVD]] boxed set titled ''Ai confini della realt\u00e0 \u2013 I tesori perduti''.  The ''Twilight Zone Season 1'' [[Blu-ray]] boxed set released on September 14, 2010, offers a remastered high-definition version of the original ''Desilu Playhouse'' production as a special feature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Twilight-Zone-Season-1-Press-Release/13986 |title=The Twilight Zone DVD news: Official Season 1 Press Release |work=TVShowsOnDVD.com |accessdate=2013-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015182535/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Twilight-Zone-Season-1-Press-Release/13986 |archivedate=2012-10-15 }}</ref>\n\n=== Original series (1959\u20131964) ===\n{{Main|The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)}}\n\n[[File:Rod Serling dictating script 1959.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rod Serling]] working on his script with a dictating machine, 1959]]\nThe series was produced by Cayuga Productions, Inc., a production company owned and named by Serling. It reflects his background in Central New York State and is named after Cayuga Lake, on which he owned a home, and where Cornell University and Ithaca College are located.\n\nAside from Serling, who wrote or adapted nearly two-thirds of the series' total episodes, writers for ''The Twilight Zone'' included leading authors such as [[Charles Beaumont]], [[Ray Bradbury]],<ref>\n{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/59288/8-bizarre-facts-about-rod-serling-and-twilight-zone|title=8 Bizarre Facts About Rod Serling and ''The Twilight Zone''|date=2014-10-08|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808105412/http://mentalfloss.com/article/59288/8-bizarre-facts-about-rod-serling-and-twilight-zone|archive-date=2017-08-08|url-status=live}}\n</ref> [[Earl Hamner, Jr.]], [[George Clayton Johnson]], [[Richard Matheson]], [[Reginald Rose]], and [[Jerry Sohl]]. Many episodes also featured new adaptations of classic stories by such writers as [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[Jerome Bixby]], [[Damon Knight]], [[John Collier (fiction writer)|John Collier]], and [[Lewis Padgett]].\n\n''Twilight Zone''{{'s}} writers frequently used science fiction as a vehicle for social comment, as networks and sponsors who censored controversial material from live dramas were less concerned with seemingly innocuous fantasy and sci-fi stories. Frequent themes on ''The Twilight Zone'' included [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], [[McCarthyism]], and [[mass hysteria]], subjects that were avoided on less serious primetime television. Episodes such as \"[[The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street]]\" and \"[[I Am the Night\u2014Color Me Black]]\" offered specific commentary on current events and social issues. Other stories, such as \"[[The Masks (The Twilight Zone)|The Masks]]\", \"[[I Dream of Genie]]\", or \"[[Mr. Denton on Doomsday]]\" were [[allegories]], [[parables]], or [[fables]] that reflected the moral and philosophical choices of the characters.\n\nDespite his esteem in the writing community, Serling found the series difficult to sell. Few critics felt that science fiction could transcend empty escapism and enter the realm of adult drama. In a September 22, 1959, interview with Serling, [[Mike Wallace]] asked a question illustrative of the times: \"...[Y]ou're going to be, obviously, working so hard on ''The Twilight Zone'' that, in essence, for the time being and for the foreseeable future, you've given up on writing anything important for television, right?\" While Serling's appearances on the show became one of its most distinctive features, with his clipped delivery still widely imitated today, he was reportedly nervous about it and had to be persuaded to appear on camera. Serling often steps into the middle of the action while the characters remain oblivious to him, but on one notable occasion, they are aware of his presence: In the episode \"[[A World of His Own]]\", a writer ([[Keenan Wynn]]) with the power to alter his reality objects to Serling's narration and promptly erases Serling from the show.\n\nIn season two, due to budgetary constraints, the network decided \u2013 against Serling's wishes \u2013 to cut costs by shooting some episodes on [[videotape]] rather than film. The requisite multicamera setup of the videotape format precluded location shooting, severely limiting the potential scope of the storylines, and the experiment was abandoned after just six episodes (\"[[Twenty Two (The Twilight Zone)|Twenty Two]]\", \"[[Static (The Twilight Zone)|Static]]\", \"[[The Whole Truth (The Twilight Zone)|The Whole Truth]]\", \"[[The Lateness of the Hour]]\", \"[[The Night of the Meek]]\", and \"[[Long Distance Call]]\").\n\nThe original series contains 156 episodes. The episodes in seasons one through three are 30 minutes long with commercials (24 or 25 minutes without commercials). Season four (1962\u201363) consists of one-hour episodes with commercials (51 minutes without commercials). Season five returned to the half-hour format.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Twilight Zone|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052520/|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\n===First revival (1985\u20131989)===\n{{Main|The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)}}\nIt was Serling's decision to sell his share of the series back to the network that eventually allowed for a ''Twilight Zone'' revival. As an in-house production, CBS stood to earn more money producing ''The Twilight Zone'' than it could by purchasing a new series produced by an outside company. Even so, the network was slow to consider a revival, turning down offers from the original production team of Rod Serling and [[Buck Houghton]] and later from American filmmaker [[Francis Ford Coppola]].\n\nCBS gave the new ''Twilight Zone'' a [[greenlight]] in 1984 under the supervision of Carla Singer, then Vice President of Drama Development. While the show did not come close to matching the enduring popularity of the original, some episodes \u2013 particularly [[Alan Brennert]]'s love story \"[[Her Pilgrim Soul]]\" and [[J. Neil Schulman]]'s \"[[Profile in Silver]]\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0734727/reviews|title=\"The Twilight Zone\" Profile in Silver/Button, Button (TV Episode 1986)|author=|date=|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}{{unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0734727/ratings|title=\"The Twilight Zone\" Profile in Silver/Button, Button (TV Episode 1986)|author=|date=|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}{{unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}</ref> \u2013 were critically acclaimed. In a tribute to the original series, the opening credits include a brief image of Rod Serling. Four episodes are remakes of those from the original series: \"[[Night of the Meek]]\", \"[[Shadow Play (The Twilight Zone, 1985)|Shadow Play]]\", \"[[The After Hours (1986 The Twilight Zone)|The After Hours]]\" and \"[[A Game of Pool (The Twilight Zone, 1985)|A Game of Pool]]\", while \"[[Dead Woman's Shoes]]\" is an adaptation of \"[[Dead Man's Shoes (The Twilight Zone)|Dead Man's Shoes]]\". Unlike the original series and the second revival, this series does not include the opening monologue during the title sequence. As well, the narration is all strictly voice-over and the narrator never appears on-screen.\n\n===''Rod Serling's Lost Classics'' (1994)===\n{{Main|Rod Serling's Lost Classics}}\nIn the early 1990s, [[Richard Matheson]] and Carol Serling produced an outline for a two-hour made-for-TV movie which would feature Matheson adaptations of three yet-unfilmed Rod Serling short stories. Outlines for such a production were rejected by CBS until early 1994, when Serling's widow discovered a complete shooting script (\"Where the Dead Are\") authored by her late husband, while rummaging through their garage. She showed the forgotten script to producers Michael O'Hara and Laurence Horowitz, who were significantly impressed by it. \"I had a pile of scripts, which I usually procrastinate about reading. But I read this one right away and, after 30 pages, called my partner and said, \"I love it,\" recalled O'Hara. \"This is pure imagination, a period piece, literate \u2013 some might say wordy. If Rod Serling's name weren't on it, it wouldn't have a chance at getting made.\"\n\nEager to capitalize on Serling's celebrity status as a writer, CBS packaged \"Where the Dead Are\" with Matheson's adaptation of \"The Theatre\", debuting as a two-hour feature on the night of May 19, 1994, under the name ''Twilight Zone: Rod Serling's Lost Classics''. The title represents a misnomer, as both stories were conceived long after ''Twilight Zone's'' cancellation. Written just months before Serling's death, \"Where the Dead Are\" starred [[Patrick Bergin]] as a 19th-century doctor who stumbles upon a [[mad scientist]]'s medical experiments with immortality. \"The Theatre\" starred [[Amy Irving]] and [[Gary Cole]] as a couple who visits a cineplex where they discover the feature presentation depicts their own lives. [[James Earl Jones]] provided opening and closing narrations.\n\nCritical response was mixed. [[Gannett News Service]] described it as \"taut and stylish, a reminder of what can happen when fine actors are given great words.\" ''[[USA Today]]'' was less impressed, even suggesting that Carol Serling \"should have left these two unproduced mediocrities in the garage where she found them.\" Ultimately, ratings proved insufficient to justify a proposed sequel featuring three scripts adapted by Matheson.\n\n===Second revival (2002\u20132003)===\n{{Main|The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)}}\n\nA second revival was developed by [[UPN]] in 2002, it was hosted by [[Forest Whitaker]]. It was broadcast in a one-hour format composed of two half-hour stories, it was canceled after one season. \"[[It's Still a Good Life]]\" is a sequel to \"[[It's a Good Life (The Twilight Zone)|It's a Good Life]]\", \"[[The Monsters Are on Maple Street]]\" is an adaptation of \"[[The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street]]\" and \"[[Eye of the Beholder (2003 The Twilight Zone episode)|Eye of the Beholder]]\" is a remake of [[Eye of the Beholder (1960 Twilight Zone episode)|an episode from the original series]], with Serling still credited as writer.\n\n===Third revival (2019\u2013present)===\n{{Main|The Twilight Zone (2019 TV series)}}\nIn December 2012, it was reported that [[Bryan Singer]] was developing and executive producing a third revival television series for [[CBS Television Studios]]. A writer for the series was not chosen and the program was not pitched to any networks. CBS, which broadcast the original series and first revival, was reportedly interested.<ref>\n{{Cite news|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/12/bryan-singer-to-spearhead-twilight-zone-series-reboot-for-cbs-tv-studios/|title=Bryan Singer To Spearhead \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 Series Reboot For CBS TV Studios|work=Deadline|date=2012-12-19|accessdate=2012-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231003924/http://www.deadline.com/2012/12/bryan-singer-to-spearhead-twilight-zone-series-reboot-for-cbs-tv-studios/|archive-date=2012-12-31|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2012/1220/singerb.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130218002308/http://www.rte.ie/ten/2012/1220/singerb.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-02-18|title=Singer leads Twilight Zone reboot|date=2012-12-20|accessdate=2012-12-26}}</ref><ref>\n{{Cite news|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/19/bryan-singer-developing-new-tv-version-of-the-twilight-zone|title=Bryan Singer Developing New TV Version of The Twilight Zone|work=[[IGN]]|date=2012-12-19|accessdate=2012-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222001203/http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/19/bryan-singer-developing-new-tv-version-of-the-twilight-zone|archive-date=2012-12-22|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/twilight-zone-bryan-singer-405478|title=X-Men's' Bryan Singer Prepping 'Twilight Zone' Reboot|date=2012-12-19|accessdate=2012-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231020705/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/twilight-zone-bryan-singer-405478|archive-date=2012-12-31|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite news|url=https://screenrant.com/twilight-zone-cbs-bryan-singer/|title=Bryan Singer Developing New \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 Series For CBS|date=2012-12-19|accessdate=2012-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223075247/http://screenrant.com/twilight-zone-cbs-bryan-singer/|archive-date=2012-12-23|url-status=live}}\n</ref> In February 2013, Singer told ''TG Daily'' that the project was still in development and that he hoped to direct the pilot and have [[A-list]] actors appear on the revival.<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Bryan Singer Hoping for an A-list cast for his Twilight Zone show|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/bryan-singer-breaks-his-silence-on-man-of-steel|work=[[Total Film]]|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=August 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825115419/http://www.totalfilm.com/news/bryan-singer-breaks-his-silence-on-man-of-steel|archive-date=2013-08-25|url-status=live}}\n</ref> The following month, he told ''[[IGN]]'' that a writer with whom he had previously worked was in negotiations to join the revival and that he felt \"passionate\" towards the original series and the planned revival.<ref>\n{{cite web|last=Cornet|first=Roth|title=What\u2019s Happening with Bryan Singer\u2019s Planned Twilight Zone Series Reboot?|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/08/whats-happening-with-bryan-singers-planned-twilight-zone-reboot-series|accessdate=August 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715212102/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/08/whats-happening-with-bryan-singers-planned-twilight-zone-reboot-series|archive-date=2013-07-15|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nIn February 2016, it was reported that [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]] would write and direct the pilot episode of the revival series.

The station list and episodes for download, including 3 Free episodes are available at the official website at www.twilightzoneradio.com\n\n===Scripts===\nBeginning in 2001, Gauntlet Press began publishing collections of original scripts from ''The Twilight Zone'' by Charles Beaumont, Richard Matheson, and Rod Serling. A ten-volume signed, limited edition series of all 92 of Rod Serling's scripts, authorized by his wife, Carol Serling, began yearly publication in 2004. Many of the scripts contain handwritten edits by Serling himself and differ in significant ways from the aired versions; most volumes contain an alternate version of a selected script. The script for \"[[The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street]]\" has been published into 7th grade reading books in the form of a play.\n\n===Stage productions===\nLive theatre productions of the original episodes can be seen in Los Angeles and Seattle, where Theater Schmeater has continuously produced a late night series, \"The Twilight Zone \u2013 Live\" with permission of the Serling estate, since 1996.

Designed by [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], the attraction is present at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] in [[Orlando]], [[Walt Disney Studios Park]] in [[Paris]] and [[Tokyo DisneySea]] in [[Japan]]. A fourth attraction at [[Disney California Adventure]] operated from 2004 to 2017 before being re-themed to [[Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 Mission: Breakout!]]. The attraction in Japan is the only one not themed to ''The Twilight Zone'', due to cultural differences and constraints in licensing for the [[Oriental Land Company]], owner and operator of the Tokyo parks. The ride also served as the inspiration for the 1997 TV film ''[[Tower of Terror (1997 film)|Tower of Terror]]'', which bears no connection to the attraction or ''The Twilight Zone''.\n\n===Syndication===\n''The Twilight Zone'' original series is currently in syndication on [[MeTV]] Network<ref>\nMeTV Network Schedule http://metv.com/shows/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618183006/http://www.metv.com/shows |date=2016-06-18 }}\n</ref> and [[Syfy]], and the 2002 revival is syndicated on the [[El Rey Network]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{in popular culture|section|date= November 2018}}\nDuring the 1980s the British food company, [[Jacob's|Jacobs]], ran a [[TV advertisement]] for one of its products - a type of biscuit called [[Twiglets]].
