He was founder and president of the now-defunct [[Total Experience Records]]. As a composer, he co-wrote several #1 R&B songs for his label's major acts, [[The Gap Band]] and [[Yarbrough and Peoples]].\n\n==Career==\nLonnie Simmons operated an LA nightclub in the mid-1970s called The Total Experience. (The club made several appearances in movies like ''[[Dolemite]]'' and ''[[Black Fist]]''.) Simmons' nightclub booked R&B-oriented musical acts, and Simmons' interest in music led him to buy a [[recording studio]]. In 1978, he signed a little-known R&B act, the Greenwood, Archer and Pine Street Band, (shortened in 1973 by a typo to the Gap Band) to his production company, and secured them a record deal with [[Mercury Records]]. The band, consisting of twelve members, was reduced officially to the three Wilson brothers. Their first Total Experience-produced single, 1979's \"Shake\", went to #4 on the R&B charts.\n\nSimmons' skills as a composer, however, would take the Gap Band to the next level. When they released ''[[The Gap Band II]]'' late in 1979, a song Simmons co-wrote with the Wilson brothers, \"[[Oops Up Side Your Head]]\", not only matched the success of \"Shake\" on the R&B charts, reaching #4 also, but exceeded it by propelling the album to [[RIAA certification|over half-a-million in sales]]. Simmons had co-written only one song on ''The Gap Band'' but co-wrote six of ''The Gap Band II's'' seven tracks.\n\nIn 1980, [[Charlie Wilson (singer)|Charlie Wilson]] went on a trip to [[Dallas]] and returned with two new friends: Cavin Yarbrough and Alisa Peoples. After a brief audition, Simmons exchanged contact information with them. When they showed up in LA, he suggested they record a demo with the label's other producer, who also served as their songwriter. They recorded the demo, and when he heard it, Simmons had yet another act in his ranks: [[Yarbrough and Peoples]]. That year, Simmons co-wrote two songs which peaked on the R&B charts at #1 back-to-back: \"[[Burn Rubber on Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)]]\", which was released on ''[[The Gap Band III]]'', and \"[[Don't Stop the Music (Yarbrough and Peoples song)|Don't Stop the Music]]\", which was released on Yarbrough & Peoples' debut album, ''The Two of Us''. The latter album went gold, while the former went platinum, selling over a million copies.\n\nSimmon's winning streak continued in 1981, when he formed Total Experience Records and convinced Mercury's parent company [[Polygram Records|PolyGram]] to distribute the label's recordings. He then signed the Gap Band and Yarbrough & Peoples to the Total Experience label. ''[[Gap Band IV]]'' was released in early 1982 and spawned three singles, which all peaked in the top-40 on the dance charts and top-2 on the R&B songs: #1 \"[[Early in the Morning (The Gap Band song)|Early in the Morning]]\", #2 \"[[You Dropped a Bomb on Me]]\" (both of which Simmons helped write), and #1 \"[[Outstanding]]\", the first two of which Simmons wrote. The album went platinum within a year. Later in 1982, he signed Robert \"Goodie\" Whitfield to the label. His debut album, ''Call Me Goodie'', peaked at #31 R&B.\n\nThe Gap Band's 1983 release, ''[[Gap Band V: Jammin']]'' (#2 R&B, #28 Billboard 200), saw Simmons take a reduced writing/producing role; he co-wrote only one song. The album went gold, headlined by the only Simmons co-penned single, \"[[Party Train]]\", which went to #3 on the R&B charts. Yarbrough and Peoples released ''[[Heartbeats (Yarbrough & Peoples album)|Heartbeats]]'' that year, and it peaked at #25 R&B, and the title track went to #10 R&B. One of their 1984 singles, \"Be a Winner\", topped the R&B charts.\n \nIn 1984, Total Experience began a new distribution deal with [[RCA Records]].\n\nEven though his two major acts produced hits well into the mid-80s, Total Experience began to falter. During 1984 and 1985, the label expanded from three acts to fourteen, including [[Bernie Hamilton]] & the Inculcation Band and [[Switch (band)|Switch]]. Not a single one of the newcomers released more than one album with Total Experience (two of them only produced one song) and none of them scored any hits. Meanwhile, Yarbrough and Peoples got married and moved back to Texas, and Goodie quit. This left the Gap Band as the label's sole act by 1986.\n\nThe Gap Band's subsequent releases, ''[[Gap Band VII]]'' and ''[[Gap Band 8]]'', received chart success due to heavy radio airplay but sold few actual copies. The Gap Band's final hurrah with Total Experience, ''Straight from the Heart'', got a top-40 song from the title track but failed to sell, causing the Gap Band to leave for [[Capitol Records]].\n\nWith no acts remaining, Lonnie dropped out of music, and his company turned to motion picture and video production.\n\nSimmons died on February 6, 2019.<ref name= eurweb>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurweb.com/2019/02/lonnie-simmons-the-man-who-discovered-the-gap-band-has-died/ |title= Lonnie Simmons: The Man Who Discovered The Gap Band Has Died|website=eurweb.com|accessdate= February 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nMusic written by Lonnie Simmons has been sampled heavily in [[Contemporary R&B]] and [[Hip Hop music]].

To reunite baby [[Mario]] with his brother [[Luigi]], who has been kidnapped by [[Kamek]], the player controls [[Yoshi]], a friendly dinosaur, through 48 [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] while carrying Baby Mario. As a ''[[Super Mario]]'' series platformer, Yoshi runs and jumps to reach the end of the level while solving puzzles and collecting items. In a style new to the series, the game has a hand-drawn aesthetic and is the first to have Yoshi as its main character. The game introduces his signature abilities to flutter jump and produce eggs from swallowed enemies.\n\nThe game is well known for its unique artstyle, which heavily contrasted with the pre-rendered artstyle of contemporary games popularized by ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''. After four years of development, ''Yoshi's Island'' released in Japan in August 1995, and worldwide two months later. Some of its special effects were powered by a new [[Super FX2]] microchip. The game was ported to the [[Game Boy Advance]] with few changes in 2002. This version was rereleased for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2011 and the [[Wii U]] [[Virtual Console]] in 2014. The Super NES version was rereleased for the [[Super NES Classic Edition]] in 2017 and the [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2019.\n\n''Yoshi's Island'' received \"instant\" and \"universal acclaim\", according to [[IGN]] and [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]], and sold over four million copies. Reviewers praised the art, sound, level design, and gameplay, and posited ''Yoshi's Island'' as a masterpiece and one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. The game brought newfound renown to both Yoshi as a character and Miyamoto's artistic and directorial career. The distinct art style and Yoshi's signature characteristics established in ''Yoshi's Island'' would carry throughout [[Yoshi (series)|a series]] of cameos, spin-offs, and sequels, including the 1997 ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'', 2006 ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]'', 2014 ''[[Yoshi's New Island]]'', and 2019's ''[[Yoshi's Crafted World]]''. It was the last 2D game in the ''Super Mario'' series released on a home console until ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' over a decade later.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Yoshi's Island - Gameplay.png|thumb|left|Yoshi aims an egg at a Piranha Plant.

The game has a hand-drawn, paper-and-crayon aesthetic.]]\n\n''Yoshi's Island'' is a 2D [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game]].<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/><ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> Its story begins as a Magikoopa<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMA3 rev\"/> of the [[Koopalings]] attacks a stork delivering baby brothers [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]].

The player navigates between platforms and atop some foes en route to the end of the increasingly difficult levels. Yoshi also collects coins to earn [[extra lives]]<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/> and retains his long tongue from ''[[Super Mario World]]''.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/> The game centers more on \"puzzle-solving and item-collecting\" than other platformers,<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> with hidden flowers and red coins to find.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> Levels include mines, ski jumps, and \"the requisite fiery dungeons\".<ref name=Mott-285/> Every fourth level (two in each world<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/>) is a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss fight]] against a large version of a previous foe.<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/>\n\nIn a style new to the series,<ref name=Mott-285/> the game has a [[coloring book]] aesthetic with \"scribbled crayon\" backgrounds, and Yoshi vocalizes with its every action.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> Expanding on his \"trademark tongue\" ability to swallow enemies,<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMA3 rev\"/> Yoshi, as the focus of the game, was given a new move set: the ability to \"flutter jump\", throw eggs, and transform. The flutter jump gives Yoshi a secondary boost when the player holds the jump button.<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> It became his new \"trademark move\", similar to that of Luigi in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]''. Yoshi can also pound the ground from mid-air to bury objects or break through soft earth. The dinosaur's long tongue grabs enemies at a distance.<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/> Swallowed enemies can either be spat as projectiles immediately or stored for later use as an egg.<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> The player individually aims and fires the eggs at obstacles via a new targeting system. The eggs also bounce off of surfaces in the environment. Up to six eggs can be stored this way, and will trail behind the character.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/> Yoshi can also eat certain items for [[power-up]] abilities. For instance, watermelons let Yoshi shoot seeds from his mouth like a machine gun, and fire enemies turn his mouth into a flamethrower. Other power-ups transform Yoshi into vehicles including cars, drills, helicopters, and submarines. A star power-up makes Baby Mario invulnerable and extra fast.<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/>\n\nWhile Yoshi is \"virtually invincible\", if hit by an enemy, Baby Mario will float off his back in a bubble while a timer counts down to zero. When the timer expires, Koopas arrive to take Baby Mario<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> and Yoshi loses a life.<ref name=\"IGN: E3 Impressions\"/> The player can replenish the timer by collecting small stars<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> and power-ups.<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> However, Yoshi can also lose a life instantly if he comes into contact with obstacles such as pits, spikes, lava, and thorns.  Similar to ''[[Super Mario World]]'', the player can hold a power-up in reserve, such as a \"+10 star\" (which adds ten seconds to the Baby Mario timer) or a \"magnifying glass\" (which reveals all hidden red coins in a level).<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> These power-ups are acquired in several [[minigames]].<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> At the end of each level, the Yoshi relays Baby Mario to the successive Yoshi.<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> If the player perfects all eight levels in each world by finishing with all flowers, red coins, and full 30 seconds on the timer, two hidden levels will unlock.<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/> There are three save slots on the cartridge.<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/>\n\nThe [[Game Boy Advance]] version adds an exclusive bonus level for each world with 100% level completion.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> It also includes four-player support via link cable,<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> but only to play ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', a [[pack-in]] feature also included on the other ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' games.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/>\n\n==Development==\n{{Quote box\n| quote = ... we have included a lot of magic tricks.

At this time, ''Super Mario World'' character designer [[Shigefumi Hino]] was approached by ''Super Mario'' creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and asked to develop an original project. Hino felt that they had already explored every possible avenue with 2D ''Mario'' platformers (the 3D ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' being in its preliminary stages at this point). After brainstorming, he landed on the idea of using Yoshi as the main character of a platforming game, with the goal of being more accessible than previous games in the ''Mario'' series.<ref name=\"SNES Classic Interview\"/> \n<!--[[File:Shigeru Miyamoto at E3 2013 1 (cropped).JPG|thumb|right| [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] produced the game.]]-->\n\n''Yoshi's Island'' was developed by [[Nintendo EAD]] and published by Nintendo for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES).<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> Development was spearheaded by Hino and [[Takashi Tezuka]], with Miyamoto serving as producer.

To wit, Nicholas Dean Des Barres said it was \"one of the handful of truly perfect games ever produced\", and lamented that the magazine had given ''Donkey Kong Country'', which he felt was a lackluster game in comparison, the extra single point for a perfect score.<ref name=\"GF Viewpoint\"/> Casey Loe removed that one point for Baby Mario's \"annoying screech\".<ref name=\"GF Viewpoint\"/> ''Nintendo Power'' and ''Nintendo Life'' too found Baby Mario's crying sounds annoying.<ref name=\"NP77 rev\"/><ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> Reviewing the Super Nintendo release over a decade later, Kaes Delgrego of ''Nintendo Life'' said the crying and some easy boss battles, while both minor, were the game's only shortcomings. Delgrego credited ''Yoshi's Island'' with perfecting the genre, calling it \"perhaps the greatest platformer of all time\".<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> The game has sold over four million copies.<ref name=\"Edge: sales\"/>\n\nBoth contemporaneous and retrospective reviewers praised the art,<ref name=\"ONM: best\"/><ref name=\"NP77 rev\"/><ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> level design, and gameplay,<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/><ref name=\"ONM: best\"/><ref name=\"NP77 rev\"/><ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/><ref name=\"GF Viewpoint\"/> which became legacies of the game.<ref name=\"IGN: 125\"/><ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/><ref name=\"IGN: Bad\"/> Some called it \"charm\".<ref name=\"IGN: 125\"/><ref name=\"NEXT: review\"/><ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> Delgrego of ''Nintendo Life'' would stop mid-game just to watch what enemies would do.<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> Martin Watts of the same publication called it \"an absolute pleasure on the eyes and unlike any other SNES game\".<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMA3 rev\"/> Others praised the control scheme, technical effects,<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> and sound design.<ref name=\"IGN: 125\"/><ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/><ref name=\"NP263 rev\"/> ''Nintendo Life''{{'s}} Delgrego felt \"goosebumps and tingles\" during the ending theme, and marked the soundtrack's range from the lighthearted intro to the \"epic grandeur of the final boss battle\".<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/>\n\n''Edge'' praised the game's balance of challenge and accessibility. The magazine thought that the new power-ups of ''Yoshi's Island'' gave its gameplay and level design great range, and that the powers were significant additions to the series on par with the suits of ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' or Yoshi's own debut in ''Super Mario World''.<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/> ''Diehard GameFan''{{'s}} Taylor wrote that there was enough gameplay innovation to make him cry and listed his favorites as the Baby Mario cape invincibility power-up, the machine gun-style seed spitting, and the snowball hill level.<ref name=\"GF Viewpoint\"/> ''Nintendo Life''{{'s}} Watts called the egg stockpiling mechanic as \"clever\" for the way it encourages experimentation with the environment as well as tempered wastefulness.<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMA3 rev\"/> ''Edge'' thought of ''Yoshi's Island'' as a \"fusion of technology and creativity, each enhancing the other\".<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/> The magazine considered the game's special effects expertly integrated into the gameplay, and described the developer's handicraft as having an \"attention to detail that few games can match\".<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/>\n\nReviewing the Game Boy Advance release in 2002, Craig Harris of IGN wrote that ''Yoshi's Island'' was \"the best damn platformer ever developed\".<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> While acknowledging the game's roots in the ''Super Mario'' series, he said the game created enough gameplay ideas to constitute its own franchise.<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> IGN's Lucas M. Thomas wrote that the game's story was also interesting as the origin story for the Mario brothers.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/> Harris felt that the FX2 sprite-changing effects gave the game \"life\" and that the Game Boy Advance cartridge could handle the effects just as well. He added that Yoshi's morphing abilities<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> and sound effects were designed well.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> Levi Buchanan of IGN said the game struck the right balance of tutorial by trial and error.<ref name=\"IGN: Bad\"/> IGN's Harris also noted a few Game Boy Advance-specific issues: [[framerate]] drop in areas where a lot is happening onscreen, camera panning problems due to the screen's lower resolution, and a \"poor\" implementation of the \"dizzy\" special effect on the handheld release.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> Critics wrote that the \"coloring book\"-style graphics held up well.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> IGN's Harris felt it was the best of the ''Super Mario Advance'' games.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> Of the similar version for the Wii U, Watts of ''Nintendo Life'' also noticed the framerate issues and problems resulting from the screen's closer crop, which were \"not enough to ruin the game, but ... noticeable\".<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMA3 rev\"/> ''Edge'' felt that game's only disappointment was the linearity of its [[overworld]] following the exploratory ''Super Mario World'' and that the sequel would \"inevitably ... have less impact\".<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/><ref name=\"Edge: GBA\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nMultiple retrospective critics declared ''Yoshi's Island'' a \"masterpiece\".<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi9\"/><ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> IGN recalled it as \"one of the most loved SNES adventures of all time\".<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi5\"/> ''Yoshi's Island'' brought newfound renown to both Yoshi as a character and Shigeru Miyamoto's artistic and directorial career.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/> IGN's Lucas M. Thomas wrote that game marked where Yoshi \"came into his own\" and developed many of his definitive characteristics: the \"signature\" flutter jump, and ability to throw eggs and transform shape.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/> IGN's Harris noted that the designers gave Yoshi a \"cute\" voice to accompany its move set and remains a hallmark feature of the character.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> Baby Mario, who debuted in the game, went on to feature in a number of sports-related games.<ref name=\"NP263 rev\"/> Series producer [[Takashi Tezuka]] said he consciously continued \"the handicraft feel\" of the original throughout the series, which later included yarn and similar variations.<ref name=\"IGN: New Island\"/> ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' called the art style \"a bold step ... that paid off handsomely\".<ref name=\"ONM: best\"/> Delgrego of ''Nintendo Life'' wrote that the game marked a new era of art in video games that prioritized creativity over graphics technology.<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/>\n\nDelgrego continued that the game's countdown-based [[Health (gaming)|life]] was a \"revolutionary\" mechanic that would later become ubiquitous in games like the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]].<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> Martin Watts also of ''Nintendo Life'' considered ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' to be a more momentous event in gaming history, but felt that ''Yoshi's Island'' was the \"most significant\" event in the \"''Mario Bros.'' timeline\".<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMA3 rev\"/> In a retrospective, IGN wrote that Super Nintendo console owners widely embraced the game alongside ''Donkey Kong Country''.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/>\n\nIGN's Jared Petty wrote that ''Yoshi's Island'' bested \"the test of time far better than many of its contemporaries\".<ref name=\"IGN: 125\"/> Levi Buchanan of IGN thought Nintendo took a risk with ''Yoshi's Island'' by making Mario passive and giving Yoshi new abilities.<ref name=\"IGN: Bad\"/> Christian Donlan of ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]'' wrote that the game was a testament to the Mario team's \"staggering confidence\" in its development ability. He said the game was \"perhaps the most imaginative platformer\" of its time.<ref name=Mott-285/> In 1997 ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' ranked it the 7th best console game of all time, saying it \"is as much a piece of art as a game\" and \"is the epitome of platform gaming, falling only inches behind ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' as the best 2-D platformer of all time.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |title=100 Best Games of All Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=100 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1997|page=154}} Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article (on page 100) explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.</ref> ''Yoshi's Island'' ranked 22nd on ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]''{{'s}} 2009 top 100 Nintendo games as a \"bone fide classic\",<ref name=\"ONM: best\"/> 15th on IGN's 2014 top 125 Nintendo games of all time,<ref name=\"IGN: 125\"/> and second on USgamer's 2015 best ''Mario'' platformers list.<ref name=\"USG: Best Platformers\"/>\n\n=== Sequels and spin-offs ===\n\n''Yoshi's Island'' led to a strong year for Yoshi as a character.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi5\"/> IGN's Thomas added that the hand-drawn style of ''Yoshi's Island'' made the computer-generated ''Donkey Kong Country'' appear outdated, though both games sold well, and [[Rareware]] included a Yoshi cameo in their sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'', released that same year. ''Yoshi's Island'' graphics and characters were also incorporated into the 1996 Super Nintendo tile [[puzzle game]] ''[[Tetris Attack]]''.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/>\n\nFollowing ''Yoshi's Island''{{'s}} success, Nintendo developed ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'', a 1998 platformer for the [[Nintendo 64]], which \"disappointed\" audiences and deflated \"massive ... anticipation\" with fetch quests and the 3D style Miyamoto eschewed in its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi5\"/> The Nintendo 64 game expanded on Yoshi's character voice as introduced in ''Yoshi's Island'',<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> but also \"dumbed down Yoshi's character\".<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi5\"/> Nintendo created two ''Yoshi's Island'' spin-off games: the [[tilt sensor]]-controlled ''[[Yoshi Topsy Turvy]]'' (2004, Game Boy Advance),<ref name=\"NWR: director\"/> which was developed by [[Artoon]]<ref name=\"NWR: director\"/><ref name=\"IGN: DS rev\"/> and critically panned,<ref name=\"IGN: DS rev\"/> and the Nintendo-developed minigame ''[[Yoshi Touch & Go]]'' (2005, Nintendo DS).<ref name=\"IGN: T&G prev\"/><ref name=\"IGN: T&G rev\"/> The 1995 original release received a direct sequel in 2006: ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]'',<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi9\"/> also developed by Artoon.<ref name=\"NWR: director\"/> Titled ''Yoshi's Island 2'' until just before it shipped, the game retained the core concept of transporting baby Nintendo characters, and added babies [[Princess Peach]], [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], and [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], each with an individual special ability. Yoshi had a similar move set to ''Yoshi's Island'' and added dash and float abilities, but was more passive a character compared to the babies on his back.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi9\"/>\n\nAbout seven years later, series producer Takashi Tezuka decided enough time had passed to make another direct sequel, ''[[Yoshi's New Island]]'' (2013, Nintendo 3DS).<ref name=\"IGN: New Island\"/> It was developed by former Artoon employees at their new company, [[Arzest]].<ref name=\"NWR: director\"/> As in the original, Yoshi carries Baby Mario and throws eggs. The game adds the ability to swallow big foes, which become big eggs that can destroy big obstacles. ''Yoshi's Island DS'' developer Arzest assisted in its development.<ref name=\"IGN: New Island\"/> In ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]'' (2010), Christian Donlan wrote that despite the \"streamlined\" ''Yoshi's Story'' and \"brilliant\" ''Yoshi's Touch and Go'', \"the original was never bettered and never truly advanced upon\".<ref name=Mott-285/> In ''Eurogamer''{{'s}} 2015 preview of ''[[Yoshi's Woolly World]]'', Tom Phillips wrote that it had \"been 20 years since the last truly great ''Yoshi's Island''{{-\"}}.<ref name=\"Eurogamer: Wooly\"/> The next console release of a ''Mario'' 2D side-scroller, ''[[New Super Mario Bros.

To reunite baby [[Mario]] with his brother [[Luigi]], who has been kidnapped by [[Kamek]], the player controls [[Yoshi]], a friendly dinosaur, through 48 [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] while carrying Baby Mario. As a ''[[Super Mario]]'' series platformer, Yoshi runs and jumps to reach the end of the level while solving puzzles and collecting items. In a style new to the series, the game has a hand-drawn aesthetic and is the first to have Yoshi as its main character. The game introduces his signature abilities to flutter jump and produce eggs from swallowed enemies.\n\nThe game is well known for its unique artstyle, which heavily contrasted with the pre-rendered artstyle of contemporary games popularized by ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''. After four years of development, ''Yoshi's Island'' released in Japan in August 1995, and worldwide two months later. Some of its special effects were powered by a new [[Super FX2]] microchip. The game was ported to the [[Game Boy Advance]] with few changes in 2002. This version was rereleased for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2011 and the [[Wii U]] [[Virtual Console]] in 2014. The Super NES version was rereleased for the [[Super NES Classic Edition]] in 2017 and the [[Nintendo Switch]] in 2019.\n\n''Yoshi's Island'' received \"instant\" and \"universal acclaim\", according to [[IGN]] and [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]], and sold over four million copies. Reviewers praised the art, sound, level design, and gameplay, and posited ''Yoshi's Island'' as a masterpiece and one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. The game brought newfound renown to both Yoshi as a character and Miyamoto's artistic and directorial career. The distinct art style and Yoshi's signature characteristics established in ''Yoshi's Island'' would carry throughout [[Yoshi (series)|a series]] of cameos, spin-offs, and sequels, including the 1997 ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'', 2006 ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]'', 2014 ''[[Yoshi's New Island]]'', and 2019's ''[[Yoshi's Crafted World]]''. It was the last 2D game in the ''Super Mario'' series released on a home console until ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' over a decade later.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Yoshi's Island - Gameplay.png|thumb|left|Yoshi aims an egg at a Piranha Plant. The timer in the top right corner will count down if Mario falls off his back. The game has a hand-drawn, paper-and-crayon aesthetic.]]\n\n''Yoshi's Island'' is a 2D [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game]].<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/><ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> Its story begins as a Magikoopa<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMA3 rev\"/> of the [[Koopalings]] attacks a stork delivering baby brothers [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]]. They succeed in kidnapping [[Baby Luigi]], but [[Baby Mario]] falls out of the sky and onto the back of [[Yoshi]],<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> the titular friendly dinosaur and [[player-character]] of the [[single-player]] game.<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> While the player controlled Mario and rode Yoshi in previous series games,<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> in ''Yoshi's Island'', the player controls one of many Yoshis, which take turns traveling through 48 [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] across six worlds<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> to rescue Baby Luigi and reunite the brothers.<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> In the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series platform game tradition, the player controls Yoshi with a two-button run and jump control scheme. The player navigates between platforms and atop some foes en route to the end of the increasingly difficult levels. Yoshi also collects coins to earn [[extra lives]]<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/> and retains his long tongue from ''[[Super Mario World]]''.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/> The game centers more on \"puzzle-solving and item-collecting\" than other platformers,<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> with hidden flowers and red coins to find.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> Levels include mines, ski jumps, and \"the requisite fiery dungeons\".<ref name=Mott-285/> Every fourth level (two in each world<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/>) is a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss fight]] against a large version of a previous foe.<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/>\n\nIn a style new to the series,<ref name=Mott-285/> the game has a [[coloring book]] aesthetic with \"scribbled crayon\" backgrounds, and Yoshi vocalizes with its every action.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> Expanding on his \"trademark tongue\" ability to swallow enemies,<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMA3 rev\"/> Yoshi, as the focus of the game, was given a new move set: the ability to \"flutter jump\", throw eggs, and transform. The flutter jump gives Yoshi a secondary boost when the player holds the jump button.<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> It became his new \"trademark move\", similar to that of Luigi in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]''. Yoshi can also pound the ground from mid-air to bury objects or break through soft earth. The dinosaur's long tongue grabs enemies at a distance.<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/> Swallowed enemies can either be spat as projectiles immediately or stored for later use as an egg.<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> The player individually aims and fires the eggs at obstacles via a new targeting system. The eggs also bounce off of surfaces in the environment. Up to six eggs can be stored this way, and will trail behind the character.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/> Yoshi can also eat certain items for [[power-up]] abilities. For instance, watermelons let Yoshi shoot seeds from his mouth like a machine gun, and fire enemies turn his mouth into a flamethrower. Other power-ups transform Yoshi into vehicles including cars, drills, helicopters, and submarines. A star power-up makes Baby Mario invulnerable and extra fast.<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/>\n\nWhile Yoshi is \"virtually invincible\", if hit by an enemy, Baby Mario will float off his back in a bubble while a timer counts down to zero. When the timer expires, Koopas arrive to take Baby Mario<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> and Yoshi loses a life.<ref name=\"IGN: E3 Impressions\"/> The player can replenish the timer by collecting small stars<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> and power-ups.<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> However, Yoshi can also lose a life instantly if he comes into contact with obstacles such as pits, spikes, lava, and thorns.  Similar to ''[[Super Mario World]]'', the player can hold a power-up in reserve, such as a \"+10 star\" (which adds ten seconds to the Baby Mario timer) or a \"magnifying glass\" (which reveals all hidden red coins in a level).<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> These power-ups are acquired in several [[minigames]].<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> At the end of each level, the Yoshi relays Baby Mario to the successive Yoshi.<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> If the player perfects all eight levels in each world by finishing with all flowers, red coins, and full 30 seconds on the timer, two hidden levels will unlock.<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/> There are three save slots on the cartridge.<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/>\n\nThe [[Game Boy Advance]] version adds an exclusive bonus level for each world with 100% level completion.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> It also includes four-player support via link cable,<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> but only to play ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', a [[pack-in]] feature also included on the other ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' games.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/>\n\n==Development==\n{{Quote box\n| quote = ... we have included a lot of magic tricks.

At this time, ''Super Mario World'' character designer [[Shigefumi Hino]] was approached by ''Super Mario'' creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and asked to develop an original project. Hino felt that they had already explored every possible avenue with 2D ''Mario'' platformers (the 3D ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' being in its preliminary stages at this point). After brainstorming, he landed on the idea of using Yoshi as the main character of a platforming game, with the goal of being more accessible than previous games in the ''Mario'' series.<ref name=\"SNES Classic Interview\"/> \n<!--[[File:Shigeru Miyamoto at E3 2013 1 (cropped).JPG|thumb|right| [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] produced the game.]]-->\n\n''Yoshi's Island'' was developed by [[Nintendo EAD]] and published by Nintendo for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES).<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> Development was spearheaded by Hino and [[Takashi Tezuka]], with Miyamoto serving as producer. Newly-hired artist Hisashi Nogami conceived the game's unique marker-drawn artstyle. The graphics were achieved by drawing them by hand, digitally scanning them, and then approximating them pixel-by-pixel.<ref name=\"SNES Classic Interview\"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/how-yoshi-s-island-got-its-beautiful-hand-drawn-look-1826849563|title=How Yoshi\u2019s Island Got Its Beautiful, Hand-Drawn Look|last=Kohler|first=Chris|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' released partway into development and resulted in the computer-generated artstyle becoming the norm for late-generation Super Nintendo games, but it was too late for the graphic designers to incorporate such a style into the game; instead, they pushed the hand-drawn artstyle even further as a way to \"fight back\".<ref name=\"SNES Classic Interview\"/> As a compromise, the game's introductory and ending cutscenes feature a pre-rendered style, contrasting with the rest of the game. According to Miyamoto, ''Yoshi's Island'' was in development for four years, which let the team add \"lots of magic tricks\".<ref name=\"NEXT: spread\"/> The game cartridge used an extra microchip to support the game's rotation, scaling<ref name=\"IGN: E3 Impressions\"/> and other sprite-changing special effects.<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> ''Yoshi's Island'' was designed to use the [[Super FX]] chip,<ref name=\"IGN: E3 Impressions\"/> but when Nintendo stopped supporting the chip, the game became the first to use [[Argonaut Games]]'s Super FX2 microchip.<ref name=\"NEXT: spread\"/> The chip powered scenes including a drawbridge falling into the foreground, rotation effects like rolling and enlarged rather than reanimated enemies, and a psychedelic effect in a level when Yoshi touches a floating fungus.<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/>\n\n== Release ==\n''Yoshi's Island'' was released first in Japan in August 1995, and two months later in North America and Europe.<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\" /> At the time of release, the Super Nintendo was in its twilight as a console<ref name=\"IGN: 125\" /> in anticipation of the [[Nintendo 64]], to be released the following year.<ref name=\"NEXT: spread\" />\n\n''Yoshi's Island'' was ported to the Game Boy Advance as ''Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3'' in North America on September 23, 2002.<ref name=\"IGN: review1\" /> In the game's preview at [[E3 2002]], IGN named ''Yoshi's Island'' \"Best Platformer\" on a handheld console.<ref name=\"IGN: E3 2002\" /> The Game Boy Advance version is a direct [[Porting of video games|port]] of the original, apart from a change to use the Yoshi voice from a later ''Yoshi'' game<ref name=\"IGN: E3 Impressions\" /> and an extra six bonus levels.

Delgrego credited ''Yoshi's Island'' with perfecting the genre, calling it \"perhaps the greatest platformer of all time\".<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> The game has sold over four million copies.<ref name=\"Edge: sales\"/>\n\nBoth contemporaneous and retrospective reviewers praised the art,<ref name=\"ONM: best\"/><ref name=\"NP77 rev\"/><ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> level design, and gameplay,<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/><ref name=\"ONM: best\"/><ref name=\"NP77 rev\"/><ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/><ref name=\"GF Viewpoint\"/> which became legacies of the game.<ref name=\"IGN: 125\"/><ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/><ref name=\"IGN: Bad\"/> Some called it \"charm\".<ref name=\"IGN: 125\"/><ref name=\"NEXT: review\"/><ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> Delgrego of ''Nintendo Life'' would stop mid-game just to watch what enemies would do.<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> Martin Watts of the same publication called it \"an absolute pleasure on the eyes and unlike any other SNES game\".<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMA3 rev\"/> Others praised the control scheme, technical effects,<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> and sound design.<ref name=\"IGN: 125\"/><ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/><ref name=\"NP263 rev\"/> ''Nintendo Life''{{'s}} Delgrego felt \"goosebumps and tingles\" during the ending theme, and marked the soundtrack's range from the lighthearted intro to the \"epic grandeur of the final boss battle\".<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/>\n\n''Edge'' praised the game's balance of challenge and accessibility. The magazine thought that the new power-ups of ''Yoshi's Island'' gave its gameplay and level design great range, and that the powers were significant additions to the series on par with the suits of ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' or Yoshi's own debut in ''Super Mario World''.<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/> ''Diehard GameFan''{{'s}} Taylor wrote that there was enough gameplay innovation to make him cry and listed his favorites as the Baby Mario cape invincibility power-up, the machine gun-style seed spitting, and the snowball hill level.<ref name=\"GF Viewpoint\"/> ''Nintendo Life''{{'s}} Watts called the egg stockpiling mechanic as \"clever\" for the way it encourages experimentation with the environment as well as tempered wastefulness.<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMA3 rev\"/> ''Edge'' thought of ''Yoshi's Island'' as a \"fusion of technology and creativity, each enhancing the other\".<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/> The magazine considered the game's special effects expertly integrated into the gameplay, and described the developer's handicraft as having an \"attention to detail that few games can match\".<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/>\n\nReviewing the Game Boy Advance release in 2002, Craig Harris of IGN wrote that ''Yoshi's Island'' was \"the best damn platformer ever developed\".<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> While acknowledging the game's roots in the ''Super Mario'' series, he said the game created enough gameplay ideas to constitute its own franchise.<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> IGN's Lucas M. Thomas wrote that the game's story was also interesting as the origin story for the Mario brothers.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/> Harris felt that the FX2 sprite-changing effects gave the game \"life\" and that the Game Boy Advance cartridge could handle the effects just as well. He added that Yoshi's morphing abilities<ref name=\"IGN: review1\"/> and sound effects were designed well.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> Levi Buchanan of IGN said the game struck the right balance of tutorial by trial and error.<ref name=\"IGN: Bad\"/> IGN's Harris also noted a few Game Boy Advance-specific issues: [[framerate]] drop in areas where a lot is happening onscreen, camera panning problems due to the screen's lower resolution, and a \"poor\" implementation of the \"dizzy\" special effect on the handheld release.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> Critics wrote that the \"coloring book\"-style graphics held up well.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> IGN's Harris felt it was the best of the ''Super Mario Advance'' games.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> Of the similar version for the Wii U, Watts of ''Nintendo Life'' also noticed the framerate issues and problems resulting from the screen's closer crop, which were \"not enough to ruin the game, but ... noticeable\".<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMA3 rev\"/> ''Edge'' felt that game's only disappointment was the linearity of its [[overworld]] following the exploratory ''Super Mario World'' and that the sequel would \"inevitably ... have less impact\".<ref name=\"Edge: SNES\"/><ref name=\"Edge: GBA\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nMultiple retrospective critics declared ''Yoshi's Island'' a \"masterpiece\".<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi9\"/><ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> IGN recalled it as \"one of the most loved SNES adventures of all time\".<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi5\"/> ''Yoshi's Island'' brought newfound renown to both Yoshi as a character and Shigeru Miyamoto's artistic and directorial career.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/> IGN's Lucas M. Thomas wrote that game marked where Yoshi \"came into his own\" and developed many of his definitive characteristics: the \"signature\" flutter jump, and ability to throw eggs and transform shape.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/> IGN's Harris noted that the designers gave Yoshi a \"cute\" voice to accompany its move set and remains a hallmark feature of the character.<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> Baby Mario, who debuted in the game, went on to feature in a number of sports-related games.<ref name=\"NP263 rev\"/> Series producer [[Takashi Tezuka]] said he consciously continued \"the handicraft feel\" of the original throughout the series, which later included yarn and similar variations.<ref name=\"IGN: New Island\"/> ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' called the art style \"a bold step ... that paid off handsomely\".<ref name=\"ONM: best\"/> Delgrego of ''Nintendo Life'' wrote that the game marked a new era of art in video games that prioritized creativity over graphics technology.<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/>\n\nDelgrego continued that the game's countdown-based [[Health (gaming)|life]] was a \"revolutionary\" mechanic that would later become ubiquitous in games like the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' series]].<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMW2 rev\"/> Martin Watts also of ''Nintendo Life'' considered ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' to be a more momentous event in gaming history, but felt that ''Yoshi's Island'' was the \"most significant\" event in the \"''Mario Bros.'' timeline\".<ref name=\"Nintendo Life: SMA3 rev\"/> In a retrospective, IGN wrote that Super Nintendo console owners widely embraced the game alongside ''Donkey Kong Country''.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/>\n\nIGN's Jared Petty wrote that ''Yoshi's Island'' bested \"the test of time far better than many of its contemporaries\".<ref name=\"IGN: 125\"/> Levi Buchanan of IGN thought Nintendo took a risk with ''Yoshi's Island'' by making Mario passive and giving Yoshi new abilities.<ref name=\"IGN: Bad\"/> Christian Donlan of ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]'' wrote that the game was a testament to the Mario team's \"staggering confidence\" in its development ability. He said the game was \"perhaps the most imaginative platformer\" of its time.<ref name=Mott-285/> In 1997 ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' ranked it the 7th best console game of all time, saying it \"is as much a piece of art as a game\" and \"is the epitome of platform gaming, falling only inches behind ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' as the best 2-D platformer of all time.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |title=100 Best Games of All Time |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=100 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1997|page=154}} Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article (on page 100) explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.</ref> ''Yoshi's Island'' ranked 22nd on ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]''{{'s}} 2009 top 100 Nintendo games as a \"bone fide classic\",<ref name=\"ONM: best\"/> 15th on IGN's 2014 top 125 Nintendo games of all time,<ref name=\"IGN: 125\"/> and second on USgamer's 2015 best ''Mario'' platformers list.<ref name=\"USG: Best Platformers\"/>\n\n=== Sequels and spin-offs ===\n\n''Yoshi's Island'' led to a strong year for Yoshi as a character.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi5\"/> IGN's Thomas added that the hand-drawn style of ''Yoshi's Island'' made the computer-generated ''Donkey Kong Country'' appear outdated, though both games sold well, and [[Rareware]] included a Yoshi cameo in their sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]]'', released that same year. ''Yoshi's Island'' graphics and characters were also incorporated into the 1996 Super Nintendo tile [[puzzle game]] ''[[Tetris Attack]]''.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi4\"/>\n\nFollowing ''Yoshi's Island''{{'s}} success, Nintendo developed ''[[Yoshi's Story]]'', a 1998 platformer for the [[Nintendo 64]], which \"disappointed\" audiences and deflated \"massive ... anticipation\" with fetch quests and the 3D style Miyamoto eschewed in its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi5\"/> The Nintendo 64 game expanded on Yoshi's character voice as introduced in ''Yoshi's Island'',<ref name=\"IGN: review2\"/> but also \"dumbed down Yoshi's character\".<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi5\"/> Nintendo created two ''Yoshi's Island'' spin-off games: the [[tilt sensor]]-controlled ''[[Yoshi Topsy Turvy]]'' (2004, Game Boy Advance),<ref name=\"NWR: director\"/> which was developed by [[Artoon]]<ref name=\"NWR: director\"/><ref name=\"IGN: DS rev\"/> and critically panned,<ref name=\"IGN: DS rev\"/> and the Nintendo-developed minigame ''[[Yoshi Touch & Go]]'' (2005, Nintendo DS).<ref name=\"IGN: T&G prev\"/><ref name=\"IGN: T&G rev\"/> The 1995 original release received a direct sequel in 2006: ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]'',<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi9\"/> also developed by Artoon.<ref name=\"NWR: director\"/> Titled ''Yoshi's Island 2'' until just before it shipped, the game retained the core concept of transporting baby Nintendo characters, and added babies [[Princess Peach]], [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], and [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], each with an individual special ability. Yoshi had a similar move set to ''Yoshi's Island'' and added dash and float abilities, but was more passive a character compared to the babies on his back.<ref name=\"IGN: Yoshi9\"/>\n\nAbout seven years later, series producer Takashi Tezuka decided enough time had passed to make another direct sequel, ''[[Yoshi's New Island]]'' (2013, Nintendo 3DS).<ref name=\"IGN: New Island\"/> It was developed by former Artoon employees at their new company, [[Arzest]].<ref name=\"NWR: director\"/> As in the original, Yoshi carries Baby Mario and throws eggs. The game adds the ability to swallow big foes, which become big eggs that can destroy big obstacles. ''Yoshi's Island DS'' developer Arzest assisted in its development.<ref name=\"IGN: New Island\"/> In ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]'' (2010), Christian Donlan wrote that despite the \"streamlined\" ''Yoshi's Story'' and \"brilliant\" ''Yoshi's Touch and Go'', \"the original was never bettered and never truly advanced upon\".<ref name=Mott-285/> In ''Eurogamer''{{'s}} 2015 preview of ''[[Yoshi's Woolly World]]'', Tom Phillips wrote that it had \"been 20 years since the last truly great ''Yoshi's Island''{{-\"}}.<ref name=\"Eurogamer: Wooly\"/> The next console release of a ''Mario'' 2D side-scroller, ''[[New Super Mario Bros.

It was held on Tuesday, November 5, 1968. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee, former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]], defeated the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, incumbent Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Analysts have argued the election of 1968 was a major [[realigning election]] as it permanently disrupted the [[New Deal coalition|New Deal Coalition]] that had dominated presidential politics for [[1932 United States presidential election|36 years]].\n\nIncumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been the early front-runner for his party's nomination, but he announced his withdrawal from the race after anti\u2013[[Vietnam War]] candidate [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Eugene McCarthy]] finished second in the [[New Hampshire primary]]. McCarthy, former [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]] emerged as the three major candidates in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1968|Democratic primaries]] until Kennedy was [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinated]] on June 5, 1968 at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]. Humphrey won the presidential nomination at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], which saw numerous anti-war protests. Nixon entered the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1968|1968 Republican primaries]] as the front-runner, and he defeated [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and other candidates at the [[1968 Republican National Convention]] to win his party's nomination. Governor [[George Wallace]] of Alabama ran on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket, campaigning in favor of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]].\n\nThe election year was tumultuous; it was marked by the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination]] of [[Civil Rights Movement]] leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] on April 4, 1968 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], subsequent [[King assassination riots]] across the nation, the assassination of Kennedy, and widespread [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam War]] across university campuses. Nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] to the nation's cities and provide new leadership in the Vietnam War. A year later, he would popularize the term \"[[silent majority]]\" to describe those he viewed as being his target voters. He also pursued a \"[[Southern strategy]]\" designed to win conservative Southern white voters who had traditionally supported the Democratic Party. Humphrey promised to continue Johnson's [[War on Poverty]] and to support the Civil Rights Movement. Humphrey trailed badly in polls taken in late August but narrowed Nixon's lead after Wallace's candidacy collapsed and Johnson suspended bombing in the Vietnam War.\n\nNixon won a plurality of the popular vote by a narrow margin, with 43.4% of the vote (6% less than he got in the 1960 election which he lost), but won by a large margin in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], carrying most states outside of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. Wallace won five states in the [[Deep South]] and ran well in some [[ethnic enclave]] industrial districts in the North; he is the most recent [[third party (United States)|third party]] candidate to win a state.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/|title=Historical U.S. Presidential Elections 1789-2016|website=www.270towin.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref> This was the first presidential election after the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which had led to mass enfranchisement of [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|racial minorities]] throughout the country, especially in the South.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/voting-rights-act|title=Voting Rights Act of 1965|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref> Nixon's victory marked the start of a period of Republican dominance in presidential elections, as Republicans won seven of the next ten elections.\n\n==Historical background==\nIn the [[1964 United States presidential election|election of 1964]], incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] won the largest popular vote landslide in [[U.S. Presidential election]] history over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]]. During the presidential term that followed, Johnson was able to achieve many political successes, including the passage of the [[Great Society]] domestic programs (including \"War on Poverty\" legislation), landmark [[civil rights]] legislation, and the continued exploration of space. Despite making significant achievements, his popular support would be short-lived. At the same time, the country endured large-scale race riots in the streets of its larger cities, along with a generational revolt of young people and violent debates over foreign policy. The emergence of the [[hippie]] [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], the rise of [[New Left]] activism, and the emergence of the [[Black Power]] movement exacerbated social and cultural clashes between classes, generations, and races. Adding to the national crisis, on April 4, 1968, [[Civil rights movement|civil rights leader]] Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], igniting further mass rioting and chaos, including [[Washington, D.C.]], where there was rioting within just a few blocks of the White House and machine guns were stationed on the Capitol steps to protect it.<ref>Thomas Adams Upchurch, ''Race relations in the United States, 1960\u20131980'' (2008) p. 7-50</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/timeline-seismic-180967503/|title=A Timeline of 1968: The Year That Shattered America|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\nThe primary reason for the precipitous decline of President Lyndon B. Johnson's popularity was the [[Vietnam War]], which he greatly escalated during his time in office. By late 1967, over 500,000 American soldiers were fighting in Vietnam.  Draftees made up 42 percent of the military in Vietnam, but suffered 58% of the casualties as nearly 1000 Americans a month were killed and many more were injured.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Westheider|title=Fighting in Vietnam: The Experience of the US Soldier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9jS16CZh0YC&pg=PA136|year=2011|publisher=Stackpole Books|pages=136\u201338|isbn=978-0-8117-0831-9}}</ref> Johnson's position was particularly damaged when the national [[news media]] began to focus on the high costs and ambiguous results of escalation, despite his repeated efforts to downplay the seriousness of the situation.\n\nIn early January 1968, [[Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] stated that the war would be winding down as the North Vietnamese were losing their will to fight, but shortly thereafter, they launched the [[Tet Offensive]], in which they and Communist [[Vietcong]] forces launched simultaneous attacks on all government strongholds in South Vietnam. Though a U.S. military victory, Tet led many Americans to ponder whether the war was winnable or worth it. In addition, voters felt they could not trust their government's assessment and reporting of the war effort. The Pentagon called for sending several hundred thousand more soldiers to Vietnam.

Thus, the party machinery and many of the new congressmen and governors supported him. Still, there was wariness in the Republican ranks over Nixon, who had lost the 1960 election and then lost the 1962 California gubernatorial election. Some hoped a more \"electable\" candidate would emerge. To a great extent the story of the 1968 Republican primary campaign and nomination is the story of one Nixon opponent after another entering the race and then dropping out. Nixon was always clearly the front runner throughout the contest because of his superior organization, and he easily defeated the rest of the field.\n\nNixon's first challenger was [[List of governors of Michigan|Michigan Governor]] [[George W. Romney]]. A Gallup poll in mid-1967 showed Nixon with 39%, followed by Romney with 25%. However, Romney, after a fact finding trip to Vietnam, told Detroit talk show host [[Lou Gordon (journalist)|Lou Gordon]] that he had been \"brainwashed\" by the military and the [[diplomatic corps]] into supporting the Vietnam War; the remark led to weeks of ridicule in the national [[news media]]. Since he had turned against American involvement in Vietnam, Romney planned to run as the anti-war Republican version of Eugene McCarthy.<ref>''The New York Times'', February 18, 1968</ref> However, following his \"brainwashing\" comment, Romney's support faded steadily, and with polls showing him far behind Nixon he withdrew from the race on February 28, 1968.<ref>''The New York Times'', February 29, 1968</ref>\n\n[[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Charles H. Percy|Charles Percy]] was considered another potential threat to Nixon even before Romney's withdrawal, and had planned on potentially waging an active campaign after securing a role as Illinois's [[favorite son]]. Later however Percy declined to have his name presented on the ballot for the Illinois presidential primary, and while he never disclaimed his interest in the presidential nomination, he no longer actively sought it either.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/09/26/archives/percy-shunning-active-68-role-wants-to-stay-off-ballot-in.html |title=PERCY SHUNNING ACTIVE '68 ROLE \u2013 Wants to Stay Off Ballot in Presidential Primaries \u2013 Article \u2013 NYTimes.com |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |accessdate=August 25, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times |date=1967-09-26 }}</ref>\n\nNixon won a resounding victory in the important New Hampshire primary on March 12, with 78% of the vote. Anti-war Republicans wrote in the name of [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the leader of the Republican Party's liberal wing, who received 11% of the vote and became Nixon's new challenger. Rockefeller had originally not intended to run, having discounted a campaign for the nomination in 1965 and planned on making [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Jacob K. Javits|Jacob Javits]] the [[favorite son]], either in preparation of a presidential campaign or to secure him the second spot on the ticket; as Rockefeller warmed to the idea of entering the race again however, Javits moved his attentions back towards seeking a third term in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/09/29/archives/javits-says-favoriteson-choice-for-68-is-still-an-open-matter.html |title=Javits Says Favorite-Son Choice For '68 Is Still an Open Matter \u2013 Article \u2013 NYTimes.com |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=September 29, 1967 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> Nixon led Rockefeller in the polls throughout the primary campaign, and though Rockefeller defeated Nixon and [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[John A. Volpe|John Volpe]] from [[Massachusetts]] primary on April 30, he otherwise fared poorly in state primaries and conventions, having declared too late to place his name on state ballots.\n\nBy early spring, [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]], the leader of the Republican Party's conservative wing, had become Nixon's chief rival. In the Nebraska primary on May 14, Nixon won with 70% of the vote to 21% for Reagan and 5% for Rockefeller. While this was a wide margin for Nixon, Reagan remained Nixon's leading challenger. Nixon won the next primary of importance, Oregon, on May 15 with 65% of the vote, and won all the following primaries except for California (June 4), where only Reagan appeared on the ballot. Reagan's victory in California gave him a plurality of the nationwide primary vote, but his poor showing in most other state primaries left him far behind Nixon in the actual delegate count.\n\nTotal popular vote:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Ronald Reagan]]: 1,696,632 (37.93%)\n* [[Richard Nixon]]: 1,679,443 (37.54%)\n* [[James A.

His only remaining obstacles were Reagan and Rockefeller, who were planning to unite their forces in a \"stop-Nixon\" movement.\n\nBecause Goldwater had done well in the [[Deep South]], delegates to the [[1968 Republican National Convention]] would be more Southern and conservative than past conventions. There was a real possibility that the conservative Reagan would be nominated if there was no victor on the first ballot. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination on the first ballot, with the aid of South Carolina [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Strom Thurmond]], who had switched parties in 1964.{{sfn|Perlstein}}{{page needed|date=March 2013}}{{sfn|Parmet|pp=503\u2013508}} He selected [[dark horse]] Maryland Governor [[Spiro Agnew]] as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.{{sfn|Parmet|p=509}}<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1968/1968-Presidential-Election/12303153093431-2/ | title=1968 Year In Review | publisher=UPI | accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> It was also reported that Nixon's first choice for running mate was his longtime friend and ally  [[Robert Finch (American politician)|Robert Finch]], who was the [[Lieutenant Governor of California]] at the time.

Johnson had been elected to the presidency only once, in 1964, and had served less than two full years of the term before that, the [[22nd Amendment]] did not disqualify him from running for another term.<ref>{{cite news|title=Johnson Can Seek Two Full Terms|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 24, 1963|page=A2}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Law Permits 2 Full Terms for Johnson|first=William|last=Moore|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|date=November 24, 1963|page=7}}</ref> As a result, it was widely assumed when 1968 began that President Johnson would run for another term, and that he would have little trouble winning the Democratic nomination.\n\nDespite growing opposition to Johnson's policies in Vietnam, it appeared that no prominent Democratic candidate would run against a sitting president of his own party.  It was also accepted at the beginning of the year that Johnson's record of domestic accomplishments would overshadow public opposition to the Vietnam War and that he would easily boost his public image after he started campaigning.<ref name=johnman1967>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,712057,00.html|title=Man Of The Year: Lyndon B.

Kennedy]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], an outspoken critic of Johnson's policies with a large base of support, publicly declined to run against Johnson in the primaries.  Poll numbers also suggested that a large share of Americans who opposed the Vietnam War felt the growth of the anti-war [[hippie movement]] among younger Americans was not helping their cause.<ref name=johnman1967 />  On January 30, however, claims by the Johnson administration that a recent troop surge would soon bring an end to the war were severely discredited when the [[Tet Offensive]] broke out. Although the American military was eventually able to fend off the attacks, and also inflict heavy losses among the communist opposition, the ability of the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong to launch large scale attacks during the Tet Offensive's long duration greatly weakened American support for the military draft and further combat operations in Vietnam.<ref name=tetl>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/tet-offensive-shakes-cold-war-confidence|title=Jan 30, 1968: Tet Offensive shakes Cold War confidence|publisher =History.com:This Day In History|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref> A recorded phone conversation which Johnson had with [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]] on January 27 revealed that both men had become aware of Kennedy's private intention to enter the Democratic Presidential primaries and that Johnson was willing to accept Daley's offer to run as Humphrey's Vice President if he were to end his re-election campaign.<ref name=jan27 /> Daley, whose city would host the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|1968 Democratic National Convention]], also preferred either Johnson or Humphrey over any other candidate and stated that Kennedy had met him the week before, and that he was unsuccessful in his attempt to win over Daley's support.<ref name=jan27>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tc0wT9P7nc&t=367s</ref>\n\nIn time, only [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Eugene McCarthy]] from [[Minnesota]] proved willing to challenge Johnson openly. Running as an anti-war candidate in the [[New Hampshire primary]], McCarthy hoped to pressure the Democrats into publicly opposing the Vietnam War. Since New Hampshire was the first presidential primary of 1968, McCarthy poured most of his limited resources into the state. He was boosted by thousands of young college students led by youth coordinator [[Sam Brown (activist)|Sam Brown]],<ref>[https://archive.is/20120714020341/http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/org.wgbh.mla:df96b4fbdd72ece621c2511b70c51217025f3845 Sam Brown discussing his involvement in the \"Clean for Gene\" campaign.] WGBH Open Vault.

These students organized get-out-the-vote drives, rang doorbells, distributed McCarthy buttons and leaflets, and worked hard in New Hampshire for McCarthy. On March 12, McCarthy won 42 percent of the primary vote to Johnson's 49 percent, a shockingly strong showing against an incumbent president, which was even more impressive because Johnson had more than 24 supporters running for the Democratic National Convention delegate slots to be filled in the election, while McCarthy's campaign organized more strategically, McCarthy won 20 of the 24 delegates. This gave McCarthy's campaign legitimacy and momentum.\n\nSensing Johnson's vulnerability, Senator Robert F. Kennedy announced his candidacy four days after the New Hampshire primary. Thereafter, McCarthy and Kennedy engaged in a series of state primaries. Despite Kennedy's high profile, McCarthy won most of the early primaries, including Kennedy's [[Massachusetts|native state of Massachusetts]] and some primaries in which he and Kennedy were in direct competition.<ref name=\"Rising1997\">{{cite book|author=George Rising|title=Clean for Gene: Eugene McCarthy's 1968 Presidential Campaign|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RiO3P6SVttYC&pg=PA122|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-95841-1|pages=122\u2013}}</ref><ref>https://potus-geeks.livejournal.com/955258.html</ref> Following his victory in the key battleground state of [[Oregon]], it was assumed that McCarthy was the preferred choice among the young voters.<ref>https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2016/05/robert_kennedy_eugene_mccarthy.html</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Johnson withdraws}}Johnson withdraws===\n\nOn March 31, 1968, following the New Hampshire primary and Kennedy's entry into the election, the president announced to the nation in a televised speech that he was suspending all bombing of North Vietnam in favor of peace talks. Johnson concluded his speech and startled the nation by announcing \"With America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world's hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office\u2014the presidency of your country. Accordingly, [[Shermanesque statement|I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President]].\" Not discussed publicly at the time was Johnson's concern he might not survive another term\u2014Johnson's health was poor, and he had suffered a serious [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1955 while serving in the U.S. Senate. Indeed, he died on January 22, 1973, only two days after the new presidential term concluded. Bleak political forecasts also contributed to Johnson's withdrawal; internal polling by Johnson's campaign in Wisconsin, the next state to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly.<ref>https://time.com/5682760/incumbent-presidents-primary-challenges/</ref>\n[[File:Hubert Humphrey and Lyndon Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon Johnson|Lyndon B.

Daley]]). This group had traditionally controlled the Democratic Party since the days of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and they feared loss of their control over the party. After Johnson's withdrawal this group rallied to support Hubert Humphrey, Johnson's vice-president; it was also believed that President Johnson himself was covertly supporting Humphrey, despite his public claims of neutrality.\n* The second faction, which rallied behind Senator Eugene McCarthy, was composed of college students, intellectuals, and upper-middle-class whites who had been the early activists against the war in Vietnam; they perceived themselves as the future of the Democratic Party.\n* The third group was primarily composed of Catholics, blacks and other minorities as well as several anti-war groups; these groups rallied behind Senator Robert F. Kennedy.\n* The fourth group consisted of white Southern Democrats. Some older men, remembering the [[New Deal]]'s positive impact upon the rural South, supported Vice-President Humphrey. Many would rally behind the third-party campaign of former Alabama Governor [[George C. Wallace]] as a \"law and order\" candidate.\n\nSince the Vietnam War had become the major issue that was dividing the Democratic Party, and Johnson had come to symbolize the war for many liberal Democrats, Johnson believed that he could not win the nomination without a major struggle, and that he would probably lose the election in November to the Republicans. However, by withdrawing from the race he could avoid the stigma of defeat, and he could keep control of the party machinery by giving the nomination to Humphrey, who had been a loyal vice-president.<ref>Dallek (1998); Woods (2006); Gould (1993).</ref>  Milne (2011) argues that, in terms of foreign-policy in the Vietnam War, Johnson at the end wanted Nixon to be president rather than Humphrey, since Johnson agreed with Nixon, rather than Humphrey, on the need to defend South Vietnam from communism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = David | year = 1968 | title = Paris peace negotiations: a two level game? | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 577\u2013599 }}</ref> However, Johnson's telephone calls show that Johnson believed the Nixon camp was deliberately sabotaging the [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris peace talks]]. He told Humphrey, who refused to use allegations based on illegal wiretaps of a presidential candidate. Nixon himself called Johnson and denied the allegations. Dallek concludes that Nixon's advice to Saigon made no difference, and that Humphrey was so closely identified with Johnson's unpopular policies that no last-minute deal with Hanoi could have affected the election.<ref>Robert Dallek, ''Nixon and Kissinger'' (2009) p 77</ref>\n\n===Contest===\n\n[[File:1968DemocraticPresidentialPrimaries.png|thumb|400px|Statewide contest by winner: Red = Kennedy, Orange = Smathers, Yellow = Young, Green = Johnson, Blue = McCarthy, Grey = No primary]]\nAfter Johnson's withdrawal, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Hubert Humphrey announced his candidacy. Kennedy was successful in four state primaries (Indiana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and California) and McCarthy won six (Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Oregon, New Jersey, and Illinois). However, in primaries where they campaigned directly against one another, Kennedy won three primaries (Indiana, Nebraska, and California) and McCarthy won one (Oregon).<ref>{{cite book |last= Cook |first= Rhodes |title=United States Presidential Primary Elections 1968\u20131996: A Handbook of Election Statistics |publisher=CQ Press |year=2000 |location= Washington, D.C. |pages=12\u201313 |isbn= 978-1-56802-451-6}}</ref> Humphrey did not compete in the primaries, leaving that job to [[favorite son]]s who were his surrogates, notably [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[George A. Smathers]] from [[Florida]], [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Stephen M. Young]] from [[Ohio]], and [[Governor of Indiana|Governor]] [[Roger D. Branigin]] of [[Indiana]]. Instead, Humphrey concentrated on winning the delegates in non-primary states, where party leaders such as [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]] controlled the delegate votes in their states. Kennedy defeated Branigin and McCarthy in the Indiana primary, and then defeated McCarthy in the Nebraska primary. However, McCarthy upset Kennedy in the Oregon primary.\n\nAfter Kennedy's defeat in Oregon, the California primary was seen as crucial to both Kennedy and McCarthy. McCarthy stumped the state's many colleges and universities, where he was treated as a hero for being the first presidential candidate to oppose the war. Kennedy campaigned in the [[ghetto]]s and [[barrio]]s of the state's larger cities, where he was mobbed by enthusiastic supporters. Kennedy and McCarthy engaged in a television debate a few days before the primary; it was generally considered a draw. On June 4, Kennedy narrowly defeated McCarthy in California, 46%\u201342%. However, McCarthy refused to withdraw from the race and made it clear that he would contest Kennedy in the upcoming New York primary, where McCarthy had much support from anti-war activists in New York City. The New York primary quickly became a moot point, however, for [[Assassination of Robert F.

Some historians, such as [[Theodore H. White]] and [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]], have argued that Kennedy's broad appeal and famed [[charisma]] would have convinced the party bosses at the Democratic Convention to give him the nomination. Jack Newfield, author of ''RFK: A Memoir'', stated in a 1998 interview that on the night he was assassinated, \"[Kennedy] had a phone conversation with Mayor Daley of Chicago, and Mayor Daley all but promised to throw the Illinois delegates to Bobby at the convention in August 1968.

The journalist [[Richard Reeves (American writer)|Richard Reeves]] and historian [[Michael Beschloss]] have both written that Humphrey was the likely nominee, and future Democratic National Committee chairman [[Larry O'Brien]] wrote in his memoirs that Kennedy's chances of winning the nomination had been slim, even after his win in California.\n\nAt the moment of RFK's death, the delegate totals were:\n*[[Hubert Humphrey]] 561\n*[[Robert F.

Although Humphrey appeared the presumptive favorite for the nomination, thanks to his support from the traditional power blocs of the party, he was an unpopular choice with many of the [[antiwar|anti-war]] elements within the party, who identified him with Johnson's controversial position on the Vietnam War. However, Kennedy's delegates failed to unite behind a single candidate who could have prevented Humphrey from getting the nomination. Some of Kennedy's support went to McCarthy, but many of Kennedy's delegates, remembering their bitter primary battles with McCarthy, refused to vote for him. Instead, these delegates rallied around the late-starting candidacy of Senator [[George McGovern]] of South Dakota, a Kennedy supporter in the spring primaries who had presidential ambitions himself. This division of the anti-war votes at the Democratic Convention made it easier for Humphrey to gather the delegates he needed to win the nomination.\n\nWhen the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] opened in Chicago, thousands of young activists from around the nation gathered in the city to [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|protest the Vietnam War]]. On the evening of August 28, in a clash which was covered on live television, Americans were shocked to see Chicago police brutally beating anti-war protesters in the streets of Chicago in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel. While the protesters chanted \"[[the whole world is watching]]\", the police used clubs and [[tear gas]] to beat back or arrest the protesters, leaving many of them bloody and dazed. The tear gas wafted into numerous hotel suites; in one of them Vice President Humphrey was watching the proceedings on television. The police said that their actions were justified because numerous police officers were being injured by bottles, rocks, and broken glass that were being thrown at them by the protestors. The protestors had also yelled insults at the police, calling them \"pigs\" and other [[epithets]]. The anti-war and police riot divided the Democratic Party's base: some supported the protestors and felt that the police were being heavy-handed, but others disapproved of the violence and supported the police. Meanwhile, the convention itself was marred by the strong-arm tactics of Chicago's mayor Richard J. Daley (who was seen on television angrily cursing Senator [[Abraham Ribicoff]] from Connecticut, who made a speech at the convention denouncing the excesses of the Chicago police). In the end, the nomination itself was anti-climactic, with Vice-President Humphrey handily beating McCarthy and McGovern on the first ballot.\n\nAfter the delegates nominated Humphrey, the convention then turned to selecting a vice-presidential nominee. The main candidates for this position were Senators [[Edward M. Kennedy]] from Massachusetts, [[Edmund Muskie]] from Maine, and [[Fred R. Harris]] from Oklahoma; Governors [[Richard J. Hughes|Richard Hughes]] of New Jersey and [[Terry Sanford]] of North Carolina; Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] of San Francisco, California; former Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Cyrus Vance]]; and Ambassador [[Sargent Shriver]] from Maryland. Another idea floated was to tap Republican Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] of New York, one of the most liberal Republicans.  Ted Kennedy was Humphrey's first choice, but the senator turned him down. After narrowing it down to Senator Muskie and Senator Harris, Vice-President Humphrey chose Muskie, a moderate and [[environmentalist]] from [[Maine]], for the nomination. The convention complied with the request and nominated Senator Muskie as Humphrey's running mate.\n\nThe publicity from the anti-war riots crippled Humphrey's campaign from the start, and it never fully recovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=58481 |title=White, pp. 377\u2013378 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> Before 1968 the city of Chicago had been a frequent host for the political conventions of both parties; since 1968 only one national convention has been held there (the [[1996 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention of 1996]], which nominated [[Bill Clinton]] for a second term).

Wallace, however, won over many of the voters Nixon targeted, effectively splitting the conservative vote. Indeed, Wallace deliberately targeted many states he had little chance of carrying himself in the hope that by splitting the conservative vote with Nixon he would give those states to Humphrey and, by extension, boost his own chances of denying both opponents an Electoral College majority.<ref>Joseph A. Aistrup, ''The southern strategy revisited: Republican top-down advancement in the South'' (2015).</ref>\n\nSince he was well behind Nixon in the polls as the campaign began, Humphrey opted for a slashing, fighting campaign style. He repeatedly \u2013 and unsuccessfully \u2013 challenged Nixon to a televised debate, and he often compared his campaign to the successful underdog effort of President [[Harry Truman]], another Democrat who had trailed in the polls, in the 1948 presidential election. Humphrey predicted that he, like Truman, would surprise the experts and win an upset victory.<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel S. Margolies|title=A Companion to Harry S.

However, Humphrey also felt constrained for most of his campaign in voicing any opposition to the Vietnam War policies of President Johnson, due to his fear that Johnson would reject any peace proposals he made and undermine his campaign. As a result, early in his campaign Humphrey often found himself the target of anti-war protestors, some of whom heckled and disrupted his campaign rallies.\n\n===Humphrey's comeback and the October surprise===\nAfter the Democratic Convention in late August, Humphrey trailed Nixon by double digits in most [[Historical polling for U.S. Presidential elections#1968 United States presidential election|polls]], and his chances seemed hopeless. According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, \"The old Democratic coalition was disintegrating, with untold numbers of blue-collar workers responding to Wallace's blandishments, Negroes threatening to sit out the election, liberals disaffected over the Vietnam War, the South lost. The war chest was almost empty, and the party's machinery, neglected by Lyndon Johnson, creaked in disrepair.\"<ref>''Time'' November 15, 1968</ref> Calling for \"the politics of joy,\" and using the still-powerful [[Trade union|labor unions]] as his base, Humphrey fought back. In order to distance himself from Johnson and to take advantage of the Democratic plurality in voter registration, Humphrey stopped being identified in ads as \"Vice-President Hubert Humphrey,\" instead being labelled \"Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey.\" Humphrey attacked Wallace as a racist bigot who appealed to the darker impulses of Americans. Wallace had been rising in the polls, and peaked at 21% in September, but his momentum stopped after he selected [[Curtis LeMay]] as his running mate. Curtis LeMay's suggestion of tactical nuclear weapons being used in Vietnam conjured up memories of the [[Barry Goldwater presidential campaign, 1964|1964 Goldwater campaign]].{{sfn|Perlstein}} Labor unions also undertook a major effort to win back union members who were supporting Wallace, with substantial success. Polls that showed Wallace winning almost one-half of union members in the summer of 1968 showed a sharp decline in his union support as the campaign progressed. As election day approached and Wallace's support in the North and Midwest began to wane, Humphrey finally began to climb in the polls.\n\nIn October, Humphrey\u2014who was rising sharply in the polls due to the collapse of the Wallace vote\u2014began to distance himself publicly from the Johnson administration on the Vietnam War, calling for a bombing halt. The key turning point for Humphrey's campaign came when President Johnson officially announced a bombing halt, and even a possible peace deal, the weekend before the election. The \"Halloween Peace\" gave Humphrey's campaign a badly needed boost. In addition, Senator Eugene McCarthy finally endorsed Humphrey in late October after previously refusing to do so, and by election day the polls were reporting a dead heat.<ref>Theodore H. White, ''The Making of the President, 1968'' (1970)</ref>\n\n===Nixon campaign sabotage of peace talks===\nThe Nixon campaign had anticipated a possible \"[[October surprise]],\" a peace agreement produced by the Paris negotiations; as such an agreement would be a boost Humphrey, Nixon thwarted any last-minute chances of a \"Halloween Peace.\" Nixon told campaign aide and his future [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H.

The key states proved to be California, Ohio, and Illinois, all of which Nixon won by three percentage points or less. Had Humphrey carried all three of these states, he would have won the election. Had he carried only two of them or just California among them, George Wallace would have succeeded in his aim of preventing an electoral college majority for any candidate, and the decision would have been given to the House of Representatives, at the time controlled by the Democratic Party. Nixon won the popular vote with a plurality of 512,000 votes, or a victory margin of about one percentage point. In the electoral college Nixon's victory was larger, as he carried 32 states with 301 electoral votes, compared to Humphrey's 13 states and 191 electoral votes and Wallace's five states and 46 electoral votes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1968|title=1968 Presidential General Election Results|last=Leip|first=David|website=David Leip's Atlas of Presidential Elections}}</ref>\n\nOut of all the states that Nixon had previously carried in 1960, Maine and Washington were the only two states that did not vote for him again; Nixon carried them during his re-election campaign in 1972. He also carried eight states that voted for John F. Kennedy in 1960: Illinois, New Jersey, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada and Delaware. This was the last time until 1988 that the state of Washington voted Democratic and until 1992 that Connecticut, Maine, and Michigan voted Democratic in the general election. Nixon was also the last Republican candidate to win a presidential election without carrying Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. This is the first time which the Republican candidate captured the White House without carrying Michigan, Minnesota, Maine and Pennsylvania. He would be the last Republican candidate to carry Minnesota (four years later, in 1972), as of 2012.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is also the first time since 1916 that Minnesota voted for the candidate who did not eventually win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.270towin.com/1916_Election/?m=In+1916,+Woodrow+Wilson+won+the+election+while+losing+Minnesota|title=Presidential Election of 1916|website=www.270towin.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\nRemarkably, Nixon won the election despite winning only two of the six states ([[Arizona]] and [[South Carolina]]) won by Republican Barry Goldwater four years earlier. He remains the only presidential candidate to win in spite of defending such a low number of his own party's states.

From 1932 to 1964, the Democratic Party was undoubtedly the majority party, winning seven out of nine presidential elections, and their agenda influenced policies undertaken by the Republican [[Eisenhower administration]]. The 1968 election reversed the situation completely. From 1968 until 2004, Republicans won seven out of ten presidential elections, and its policies clearly affected those enacted by the Democratic [[Clinton administration]] via the [[Third Way]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/10/a_realigning_election.html|title=A Realigning Election? {{!}} RealClearPolitics|website=www.realclearpolitics.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe election was a seismic event in the long-term realignment in Democratic Party support, especially in the South.<ref name=\"Misunderstanding the Southern Realignment\">{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/09/09/misunderstanding_the_southern_realignment_107084.html |title=Misunderstanding the Southern Realignment |publisher=RealClearPolitics.com|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref> Nationwide, the bitter splits over civil rights, the new left, the Vietnam War, and other \"culture wars\" were slow to heal. Democrats could no longer count on white Southern support for the presidency, as Republicans made major gains in suburban areas and areas filled with Northern migrants.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt|last=Lassiter|first=Matthew|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 17}}</ref> The rural Democratic \"courthouse cliques\" in the South lost power. While Democrats controlled local and state politics in the South, Republicans usually won the presidential vote. In 1968, Humphrey won less than ten percent of the white Southern vote, with two-thirds of his vote in the region coming from blacks, who now voted in full strength.<ref>Gould (1993) p 165; White (1969) p 401</ref>\n\nFrom 1968 until 2004, only two Democrats were elected President, both native Southerners \u2013 [[Jimmy Carter]] of Georgia and Bill Clinton of Arkansas.

Cohen, ''American Maelstrom: The 1968 Election and the Politics of Division'' (2016)</ref>\n\nAnother important result of this election was that it led to several reforms in how the Democratic Party chose its presidential nominees. In 1969, the [[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission]] adopted a set of rules for the states to follow in selecting convention delegates. These rules reduced the influence of party leaders on the nominating process and provided greater representation for minorities, women, and youth. The reforms led most states to adopt laws requiring primary elections, instead of party leaders, to choose delegates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://poliscinews.wordpress.com/tag/mcgovern-fraser-commission/|title=McGovern-Fraser Commission {{!}} Politics Matters|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1968, the only way to win the party's presidential nomination became through the primary process; Humphrey turned out to be the last nominee of either major party to win his party's nomination without having directly competed in the primaries.\n\nThis remains most recent presidential election in which a sitting president eligible for re-election did not seek another term (and one of only two such elections to occur under the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], the first being the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 election]]), and also the last election in which any third party candidate won an entire state's electoral votes, with Wallace carrying five states.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis election was the last time until 1992 that the Democratic nominee won Connecticut, Maine, and Michigan and the last until 1988 when Washington voted Democrat, and the last time a Republican won the presidency without winning Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was also the first time since 1888 that [[bellwether]] [[Co\u00f6s County, New Hampshire]] did not support the winning candidate,<ref>The Political Graveyard; [http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/NH/CO-votes.html Co\u00f6s County Votes for President]<br />David Leip's Atlas of US Presidential Elections; [http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2016&fips=33&f=0&off=0&elect=0 Presidential Election, 2016 in New Hampshire]</ref> which has occurred again only in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]]. \n\nThis was the first time since 1928 that North Carolina voted for a Republican, and the first since 1912 (only the second time since 1852 and as of 2012, the last time) that Maine and Vermont did not support same party.\nDespite the narrow (0.7%) difference in the popular vote, Humphrey took only 35.5% of the electoral vote.

It was held on Tuesday, November 5, 1968. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee, former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]], defeated the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, incumbent Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Analysts have argued the election of 1968 was a major [[realigning election]] as it permanently disrupted the [[New Deal coalition|New Deal Coalition]] that had dominated presidential politics for [[1932 United States presidential election|36 years]].\n\nIncumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been the early front-runner for his party's nomination, but he announced his withdrawal from the race after anti\u2013[[Vietnam War]] candidate [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Eugene McCarthy]] finished second in the [[New Hampshire primary]]. McCarthy, former [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]] emerged as the three major candidates in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1968|Democratic primaries]] until Kennedy was [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinated]] on June 5, 1968 at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]. Humphrey won the presidential nomination at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], which saw numerous anti-war protests. Nixon entered the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1968|1968 Republican primaries]] as the front-runner, and he defeated [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and other candidates at the [[1968 Republican National Convention]] to win his party's nomination. Governor [[George Wallace]] of Alabama ran on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket, campaigning in favor of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]].\n\nThe election year was tumultuous; it was marked by the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination]] of [[Civil Rights Movement]] leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] on April 4, 1968 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], subsequent [[King assassination riots]] across the nation, the assassination of Kennedy, and widespread [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam War]] across university campuses. Nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] to the nation's cities and provide new leadership in the Vietnam War. A year later, he would popularize the term \"[[silent majority]]\" to describe those he viewed as being his target voters. He also pursued a \"[[Southern strategy]]\" designed to win conservative Southern white voters who had traditionally supported the Democratic Party. Humphrey promised to continue Johnson's [[War on Poverty]] and to support the Civil Rights Movement. Humphrey trailed badly in polls taken in late August but narrowed Nixon's lead after Wallace's candidacy collapsed and Johnson suspended bombing in the Vietnam War.\n\nNixon won a plurality of the popular vote by a narrow margin, with 43.4% of the vote (6% less than he got in the 1960 election which he lost), but won by a large margin in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], carrying most states outside of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]].

Johnson]] won the largest popular vote landslide in [[U.S. Presidential election]] history over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]]. During the presidential term that followed, Johnson was able to achieve many political successes, including the passage of the [[Great Society]] domestic programs (including \"War on Poverty\" legislation), landmark [[civil rights]] legislation, and the continued exploration of space. Despite making significant achievements, his popular support would be short-lived. At the same time, the country endured large-scale race riots in the streets of its larger cities, along with a generational revolt of young people and violent debates over foreign policy. The emergence of the [[hippie]] [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], the rise of [[New Left]] activism, and the emergence of the [[Black Power]] movement exacerbated social and cultural clashes between classes, generations, and races. Adding to the national crisis, on April 4, 1968, [[Civil rights movement|civil rights leader]] Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], igniting further mass rioting and chaos, including [[Washington, D.C.]], where there was rioting within just a few blocks of the White House and machine guns were stationed on the Capitol steps to protect it.<ref>Thomas Adams Upchurch, ''Race relations in the United States, 1960\u20131980'' (2008) p. 7-50</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/timeline-seismic-180967503/|title=A Timeline of 1968: The Year That Shattered America|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\nThe primary reason for the precipitous decline of President Lyndon B. Johnson's popularity was the [[Vietnam War]], which he greatly escalated during his time in office. By late 1967, over 500,000 American soldiers were fighting in Vietnam.  Draftees made up 42 percent of the military in Vietnam, but suffered 58% of the casualties as nearly 1000 Americans a month were killed and many more were injured.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Westheider|title=Fighting in Vietnam: The Experience of the US Soldier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9jS16CZh0YC&pg=PA136|year=2011|publisher=Stackpole Books|pages=136\u201338|isbn=978-0-8117-0831-9}}</ref> Johnson's position was particularly damaged when the national [[news media]] began to focus on the high costs and ambiguous results of escalation, despite his repeated efforts to downplay the seriousness of the situation.\n\nIn early January 1968, [[Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] stated that the war would be winding down as the North Vietnamese were losing their will to fight, but shortly thereafter, they launched the [[Tet Offensive]], in which they and Communist [[Vietcong]] forces launched simultaneous attacks on all government strongholds in South Vietnam. Though a U.S. military victory, Tet led many Americans to ponder whether the war was winnable or worth it. In addition, voters felt they could not trust their government's assessment and reporting of the war effort. The Pentagon called for sending several hundred thousand more soldiers to Vietnam. Johnson's approval ratings fell below 35%, and the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] refused to let the president make public appearances on the campuses of American colleges and universities, due to his extreme unpopularity among college students. The Secret Service also prevented Johnson from appearing at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], because it could not guarantee his safety from assassination.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ben J.

Thus, the party machinery and many of the new congressmen and governors supported him. Still, there was wariness in the Republican ranks over Nixon, who had lost the 1960 election and then lost the 1962 California gubernatorial election. Some hoped a more \"electable\" candidate would emerge. To a great extent the story of the 1968 Republican primary campaign and nomination is the story of one Nixon opponent after another entering the race and then dropping out. Nixon was always clearly the front runner throughout the contest because of his superior organization, and he easily defeated the rest of the field.\n\nNixon's first challenger was [[List of governors of Michigan|Michigan Governor]] [[George W. Romney]]. A Gallup poll in mid-1967 showed Nixon with 39%, followed by Romney with 25%. However, Romney, after a fact finding trip to Vietnam, told Detroit talk show host [[Lou Gordon (journalist)|Lou Gordon]] that he had been \"brainwashed\" by the military and the [[diplomatic corps]] into supporting the Vietnam War; the remark led to weeks of ridicule in the national [[news media]]. Since he had turned against American involvement in Vietnam, Romney planned to run as the anti-war Republican version of Eugene McCarthy.<ref>''The New York Times'', February 18, 1968</ref> However, following his \"brainwashing\" comment, Romney's support faded steadily, and with polls showing him far behind Nixon he withdrew from the race on February 28, 1968.<ref>''The New York Times'', February 29, 1968</ref>\n\n[[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Charles H. Percy|Charles Percy]] was considered another potential threat to Nixon even before Romney's withdrawal, and had planned on potentially waging an active campaign after securing a role as Illinois's [[favorite son]]. Later however Percy declined to have his name presented on the ballot for the Illinois presidential primary, and while he never disclaimed his interest in the presidential nomination, he no longer actively sought it either.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/09/26/archives/percy-shunning-active-68-role-wants-to-stay-off-ballot-in.html |title=PERCY SHUNNING ACTIVE '68 ROLE \u2013 Wants to Stay Off Ballot in Presidential Primaries \u2013 Article \u2013 NYTimes.com |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |accessdate=August 25, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times |date=1967-09-26 }}</ref>\n\nNixon won a resounding victory in the important New Hampshire primary on March 12, with 78% of the vote.

Rockefeller had originally not intended to run, having discounted a campaign for the nomination in 1965 and planned on making [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Jacob K.

In the Nebraska primary on May 14, Nixon won with 70% of the vote to 21% for Reagan and 5% for Rockefeller. While this was a wide margin for Nixon, Reagan remained Nixon's leading challenger. Nixon won the next primary of importance, Oregon, on May 15 with 65% of the vote, and won all the following primaries except for California (June 4), where only Reagan appeared on the ballot. Reagan's victory in California gave him a plurality of the nationwide primary vote, but his poor showing in most other state primaries left him far behind Nixon in the actual delegate count.\n\nTotal popular vote:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Ronald Reagan]]: 1,696,632 (37.93%)\n* [[Richard Nixon]]: 1,679,443 (37.54%)\n* [[James A.

His only remaining obstacles were Reagan and Rockefeller, who were planning to unite their forces in a \"stop-Nixon\" movement.\n\nBecause Goldwater had done well in the [[Deep South]], delegates to the [[1968 Republican National Convention]] would be more Southern and conservative than past conventions.

It was also accepted at the beginning of the year that Johnson's record of domestic accomplishments would overshadow public opposition to the Vietnam War and that he would easily boost his public image after he started campaigning.<ref name=johnman1967>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,712057,00.html|title=Man Of The Year: Lyndon B.

Although the American military was eventually able to fend off the attacks, and also inflict heavy losses among the communist opposition, the ability of the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong to launch large scale attacks during the Tet Offensive's long duration greatly weakened American support for the military draft and further combat operations in Vietnam.<ref name=tetl>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/tet-offensive-shakes-cold-war-confidence|title=Jan 30, 1968: Tet Offensive shakes Cold War confidence|publisher =History.com:This Day In History|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref> A recorded phone conversation which Johnson had with [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago mayor]] [[Richard J.

Running as an anti-war candidate in the [[New Hampshire primary]], McCarthy hoped to pressure the Democrats into publicly opposing the Vietnam War. Since New Hampshire was the first presidential primary of 1968, McCarthy poured most of his limited resources into the state. He was boosted by thousands of young college students led by youth coordinator [[Sam Brown (activist)|Sam Brown]],<ref>[https://archive.is/20120714020341/http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/org.wgbh.mla:df96b4fbdd72ece621c2511b70c51217025f3845 Sam Brown discussing his involvement in the \"Clean for Gene\" campaign.] WGBH Open Vault.

These students organized get-out-the-vote drives, rang doorbells, distributed McCarthy buttons and leaflets, and worked hard in New Hampshire for McCarthy. On March 12, McCarthy won 42 percent of the primary vote to Johnson's 49 percent, a shockingly strong showing against an incumbent president, which was even more impressive because Johnson had more than 24 supporters running for the Democratic National Convention delegate slots to be filled in the election, while McCarthy's campaign organized more strategically, McCarthy won 20 of the 24 delegates. This gave McCarthy's campaign legitimacy and momentum.\n\nSensing Johnson's vulnerability, Senator Robert F. Kennedy announced his candidacy four days after the New Hampshire primary. Thereafter, McCarthy and Kennedy engaged in a series of state primaries. Despite Kennedy's high profile, McCarthy won most of the early primaries, including Kennedy's [[Massachusetts|native state of Massachusetts]] and some primaries in which he and Kennedy were in direct competition.<ref name=\"Rising1997\">{{cite book|author=George Rising|title=Clean for Gene: Eugene McCarthy's 1968 Presidential Campaign|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RiO3P6SVttYC&pg=PA122|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-95841-1|pages=122\u2013}}</ref><ref>https://potus-geeks.livejournal.com/955258.html</ref> Following his victory in the key battleground state of [[Oregon]], it was assumed that McCarthy was the preferred choice among the young voters.<ref>https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2016/05/robert_kennedy_eugene_mccarthy.html</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Johnson withdraws}}Johnson withdraws===\n\nOn March 31, 1968, following the New Hampshire primary and Kennedy's entry into the election, the president announced to the nation in a televised speech that he was suspending all bombing of North Vietnam in favor of peace talks. Johnson concluded his speech and startled the nation by announcing \"With America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world's hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office\u2014the presidency of your country.

Indeed, he died on January 22, 1973, only two days after the new presidential term concluded. Bleak political forecasts also contributed to Johnson's withdrawal; internal polling by Johnson's campaign in Wisconsin, the next state to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly.<ref>https://time.com/5682760/incumbent-presidents-primary-challenges/</ref>\n[[File:Hubert Humphrey and Lyndon Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon Johnson|Lyndon B.

Daley]]). This group had traditionally controlled the Democratic Party since the days of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and they feared loss of their control over the party. After Johnson's withdrawal this group rallied to support Hubert Humphrey, Johnson's vice-president; it was also believed that President Johnson himself was covertly supporting Humphrey, despite his public claims of neutrality.\n* The second faction, which rallied behind Senator Eugene McCarthy, was composed of college students, intellectuals, and upper-middle-class whites who had been the early activists against the war in Vietnam; they perceived themselves as the future of the Democratic Party.\n* The third group was primarily composed of Catholics, blacks and other minorities as well as several anti-war groups; these groups rallied behind Senator Robert F. Kennedy.\n* The fourth group consisted of white Southern Democrats. Some older men, remembering the [[New Deal]]'s positive impact upon the rural South, supported Vice-President Humphrey. Many would rally behind the third-party campaign of former Alabama Governor [[George C. Wallace]] as a \"law and order\" candidate.\n\nSince the Vietnam War had become the major issue that was dividing the Democratic Party, and Johnson had come to symbolize the war for many liberal Democrats, Johnson believed that he could not win the nomination without a major struggle, and that he would probably lose the election in November to the Republicans. However, by withdrawing from the race he could avoid the stigma of defeat, and he could keep control of the party machinery by giving the nomination to Humphrey, who had been a loyal vice-president.<ref>Dallek (1998); Woods (2006); Gould (1993).</ref>  Milne (2011) argues that, in terms of foreign-policy in the Vietnam War, Johnson at the end wanted Nixon to be president rather than Humphrey, since Johnson agreed with Nixon, rather than Humphrey, on the need to defend South Vietnam from communism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = David | year = 1968 | title = Paris peace negotiations: a two level game? | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 577\u2013599 }}</ref> However, Johnson's telephone calls show that Johnson believed the Nixon camp was deliberately sabotaging the [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris peace talks]].

Kennedy was successful in four state primaries (Indiana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and California) and McCarthy won six (Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Oregon, New Jersey, and Illinois). However, in primaries where they campaigned directly against one another, Kennedy won three primaries (Indiana, Nebraska, and California) and McCarthy won one (Oregon).<ref>{{cite book |last= Cook |first= Rhodes |title=United States Presidential Primary Elections 1968\u20131996: A Handbook of Election Statistics |publisher=CQ Press |year=2000 |location= Washington, D.C. |pages=12\u201313 |isbn= 978-1-56802-451-6}}</ref> Humphrey did not compete in the primaries, leaving that job to [[favorite son]]s who were his surrogates, notably [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[George A. Smathers]] from [[Florida]], [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Stephen M. Young]] from [[Ohio]], and [[Governor of Indiana|Governor]] [[Roger D. Branigin]] of [[Indiana]]. Instead, Humphrey concentrated on winning the delegates in non-primary states, where party leaders such as [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]] controlled the delegate votes in their states. Kennedy defeated Branigin and McCarthy in the Indiana primary, and then defeated McCarthy in the Nebraska primary. However, McCarthy upset Kennedy in the Oregon primary.\n\nAfter Kennedy's defeat in Oregon, the California primary was seen as crucial to both Kennedy and McCarthy. McCarthy stumped the state's many colleges and universities, where he was treated as a hero for being the first presidential candidate to oppose the war. Kennedy campaigned in the [[ghetto]]s and [[barrio]]s of the state's larger cities, where he was mobbed by enthusiastic supporters. Kennedy and McCarthy engaged in a television debate a few days before the primary; it was generally considered a draw. On June 4, Kennedy narrowly defeated McCarthy in California, 46%\u201342%. However, McCarthy refused to withdraw from the race and made it clear that he would contest Kennedy in the upcoming New York primary, where McCarthy had much support from anti-war activists in New York City. The New York primary quickly became a moot point, however, for [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Kennedy was assassinated]]  shortly after midnight on June 5; he died twenty-six hours later at [[Good Samaritan Hospital (Los Angeles)|Good Samaritan Hospital]]. Kennedy had just given his victory speech in a crowded ballroom of the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles; he and his aides then entered a narrow kitchen pantry on their way to a banquet room to meet with reporters.

Some historians, such as [[Theodore H. White]] and [[Arthur M.

Jack Newfield, author of ''RFK: A Memoir'', stated in a 1998 interview that on the night he was assassinated, \"[Kennedy] had a phone conversation with Mayor Daley of Chicago, and Mayor Daley all but promised to throw the Illinois delegates to Bobby at the convention in August 1968.

The journalist [[Richard Reeves (American writer)|Richard Reeves]] and historian [[Michael Beschloss]] have both written that Humphrey was the likely nominee, and future Democratic National Committee chairman [[Larry O'Brien]] wrote in his memoirs that Kennedy's chances of winning the nomination had been slim, even after his win in California.\n\nAt the moment of RFK's death, the delegate totals were:\n*[[Hubert Humphrey]] 561\n*[[Robert F.

Although Humphrey appeared the presumptive favorite for the nomination, thanks to his support from the traditional power blocs of the party, he was an unpopular choice with many of the [[antiwar|anti-war]] elements within the party, who identified him with Johnson's controversial position on the Vietnam War. However, Kennedy's delegates failed to unite behind a single candidate who could have prevented Humphrey from getting the nomination. Some of Kennedy's support went to McCarthy, but many of Kennedy's delegates, remembering their bitter primary battles with McCarthy, refused to vote for him. Instead, these delegates rallied around the late-starting candidacy of Senator [[George McGovern]] of South Dakota, a Kennedy supporter in the spring primaries who had presidential ambitions himself. This division of the anti-war votes at the Democratic Convention made it easier for Humphrey to gather the delegates he needed to win the nomination.\n\nWhen the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] opened in Chicago, thousands of young activists from around the nation gathered in the city to [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|protest the Vietnam War]]. On the evening of August 28, in a clash which was covered on live television, Americans were shocked to see Chicago police brutally beating anti-war protesters in the streets of Chicago in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel. While the protesters chanted \"[[the whole world is watching]]\", the police used clubs and [[tear gas]] to beat back or arrest the protesters, leaving many of them bloody and dazed. The tear gas wafted into numerous hotel suites; in one of them Vice President Humphrey was watching the proceedings on television. The police said that their actions were justified because numerous police officers were being injured by bottles, rocks, and broken glass that were being thrown at them by the protestors. The protestors had also yelled insults at the police, calling them \"pigs\" and other [[epithets]]. The anti-war and police riot divided the Democratic Party's base: some supported the protestors and felt that the police were being heavy-handed, but others disapproved of the violence and supported the police. Meanwhile, the convention itself was marred by the strong-arm tactics of Chicago's mayor Richard J. Daley (who was seen on television angrily cursing Senator [[Abraham Ribicoff]] from Connecticut, who made a speech at the convention denouncing the excesses of the Chicago police). In the end, the nomination itself was anti-climactic, with Vice-President Humphrey handily beating McCarthy and McGovern on the first ballot.\n\nAfter the delegates nominated Humphrey, the convention then turned to selecting a vice-presidential nominee. The main candidates for this position were Senators [[Edward M. Kennedy]] from Massachusetts, [[Edmund Muskie]] from Maine, and [[Fred R. Harris]] from Oklahoma; Governors [[Richard J. Hughes|Richard Hughes]] of New Jersey and [[Terry Sanford]] of North Carolina; Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] of San Francisco, California; former Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Cyrus Vance]]; and Ambassador [[Sargent Shriver]] from Maryland. Another idea floated was to tap Republican Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] of New York, one of the most liberal Republicans.  Ted Kennedy was Humphrey's first choice, but the senator turned him down. After narrowing it down to Senator Muskie and Senator Harris, Vice-President Humphrey chose Muskie, a moderate and [[environmentalist]] from [[Maine]], for the nomination. The convention complied with the request and nominated Senator Muskie as Humphrey's running mate.\n\nThe publicity from the anti-war riots crippled Humphrey's campaign from the start, and it never fully recovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=58481 |title=White, pp. 377\u2013378 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> Before 1968 the city of Chicago had been a frequent host for the political conventions of both parties; since 1968 only one national convention has been held there (the [[1996 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention of 1996]], which nominated [[Bill Clinton]] for a second term). Many believe that this is due in part to the violence and chaos of the 1968 convention.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|+Balloting\n|-\n!colspan=2|Presidential tally!! colspan=2|Vice Presidential tally\n|-\n![[Hubert Humphrey]] !!1759.25!!

However, Humphrey also felt constrained for most of his campaign in voicing any opposition to the Vietnam War policies of President Johnson, due to his fear that Johnson would reject any peace proposals he made and undermine his campaign. As a result, early in his campaign Humphrey often found himself the target of anti-war protestors, some of whom heckled and disrupted his campaign rallies.\n\n===Humphrey's comeback and the October surprise===\nAfter the Democratic Convention in late August, Humphrey trailed Nixon by double digits in most [[Historical polling for U.S. Presidential elections#1968 United States presidential election|polls]], and his chances seemed hopeless. According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, \"The old Democratic coalition was disintegrating, with untold numbers of blue-collar workers responding to Wallace's blandishments, Negroes threatening to sit out the election, liberals disaffected over the Vietnam War, the South lost. The war chest was almost empty, and the party's machinery, neglected by Lyndon Johnson, creaked in disrepair.\"<ref>''Time'' November 15, 1968</ref> Calling for \"the politics of joy,\" and using the still-powerful [[Trade union|labor unions]] as his base, Humphrey fought back. In order to distance himself from Johnson and to take advantage of the Democratic plurality in voter registration, Humphrey stopped being identified in ads as \"Vice-President Hubert Humphrey,\" instead being labelled \"Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey.\" Humphrey attacked Wallace as a racist bigot who appealed to the darker impulses of Americans. Wallace had been rising in the polls, and peaked at 21% in September, but his momentum stopped after he selected [[Curtis LeMay]] as his running mate. Curtis LeMay's suggestion of tactical nuclear weapons being used in Vietnam conjured up memories of the [[Barry Goldwater presidential campaign, 1964|1964 Goldwater campaign]].{{sfn|Perlstein}} Labor unions also undertook a major effort to win back union members who were supporting Wallace, with substantial success. Polls that showed Wallace winning almost one-half of union members in the summer of 1968 showed a sharp decline in his union support as the campaign progressed. As election day approached and Wallace's support in the North and Midwest began to wane, Humphrey finally began to climb in the polls.\n\nIn October, Humphrey\u2014who was rising sharply in the polls due to the collapse of the Wallace vote\u2014began to distance himself publicly from the Johnson administration on the Vietnam War, calling for a bombing halt. The key turning point for Humphrey's campaign came when President Johnson officially announced a bombing halt, and even a possible peace deal, the weekend before the election. The \"Halloween Peace\" gave Humphrey's campaign a badly needed boost. In addition, Senator Eugene McCarthy finally endorsed Humphrey in late October after previously refusing to do so, and by election day the polls were reporting a dead heat.<ref>Theodore H.

The key states proved to be California, Ohio, and Illinois, all of which Nixon won by three percentage points or less. Had Humphrey carried all three of these states, he would have won the election. Had he carried only two of them or just California among them, George Wallace would have succeeded in his aim of preventing an electoral college majority for any candidate, and the decision would have been given to the House of Representatives, at the time controlled by the Democratic Party. Nixon won the popular vote with a plurality of 512,000 votes, or a victory margin of about one percentage point. In the electoral college Nixon's victory was larger, as he carried 32 states with 301 electoral votes, compared to Humphrey's 13 states and 191 electoral votes and Wallace's five states and 46 electoral votes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1968|title=1968 Presidential General Election Results|last=Leip|first=David|website=David Leip's Atlas of Presidential Elections}}</ref>\n\nOut of all the states that Nixon had previously carried in 1960, Maine and Washington were the only two states that did not vote for him again; Nixon carried them during his re-election campaign in 1972. He also carried eight states that voted for John F. Kennedy in 1960: Illinois, New Jersey, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada and Delaware. This was the last time until 1988 that the state of Washington voted Democratic and until 1992 that Connecticut, Maine, and Michigan voted Democratic in the general election. Nixon was also the last Republican candidate to win a presidential election without carrying Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. This is the first time which the Republican candidate captured the White House without carrying Michigan, Minnesota, Maine and Pennsylvania. He would be the last Republican candidate to carry Minnesota (four years later, in 1972), as of 2012.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is also the first time since 1916 that Minnesota voted for the candidate who did not eventually win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.270towin.com/1916_Election/?m=In+1916,+Woodrow+Wilson+won+the+election+while+losing+Minnesota|title=Presidential Election of 1916|website=www.270towin.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\nRemarkably, Nixon won the election despite winning only two of the six states ([[Arizona]] and [[South Carolina]]) won by Republican Barry Goldwater four years earlier.

From 1932 to 1964, the Democratic Party was undoubtedly the majority party, winning seven out of nine presidential elections, and their agenda influenced policies undertaken by the Republican [[Eisenhower administration]]. The 1968 election reversed the situation completely. From 1968 until 2004, Republicans won seven out of ten presidential elections, and its policies clearly affected those enacted by the Democratic [[Clinton administration]] via the [[Third Way]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/10/a_realigning_election.html|title=A Realigning Election? {{!}} RealClearPolitics|website=www.realclearpolitics.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe election was a seismic event in the long-term realignment in Democratic Party support, especially in the South.<ref name=\"Misunderstanding the Southern Realignment\">{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/09/09/misunderstanding_the_southern_realignment_107084.html |title=Misunderstanding the Southern Realignment |publisher=RealClearPolitics.com|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref> Nationwide, the bitter splits over civil rights, the new left, the Vietnam War, and other \"culture wars\" were slow to heal. Democrats could no longer count on white Southern support for the presidency, as Republicans made major gains in suburban areas and areas filled with Northern migrants.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt|last=Lassiter|first=Matthew|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 17}}</ref> The rural Democratic \"courthouse cliques\" in the South lost power. While Democrats controlled local and state politics in the South, Republicans usually won the presidential vote. In 1968, Humphrey won less than ten percent of the white Southern vote, with two-thirds of his vote in the region coming from blacks, who now voted in full strength.<ref>Gould (1993) p 165; White (1969) p 401</ref>\n\nFrom 1968 until 2004, only two Democrats were elected President, both native Southerners \u2013 [[Jimmy Carter]] of Georgia and Bill Clinton of Arkansas.

Cohen, ''American Maelstrom: The 1968 Election and the Politics of Division'' (2016)</ref>\n\nAnother important result of this election was that it led to several reforms in how the Democratic Party chose its presidential nominees. In 1969, the [[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission]] adopted a set of rules for the states to follow in selecting convention delegates. These rules reduced the influence of party leaders on the nominating process and provided greater representation for minorities, women, and youth. The reforms led most states to adopt laws requiring primary elections, instead of party leaders, to choose delegates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://poliscinews.wordpress.com/tag/mcgovern-fraser-commission/|title=McGovern-Fraser Commission {{!}} Politics Matters|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1968, the only way to win the party's presidential nomination became through the primary process; Humphrey turned out to be the last nominee of either major party to win his party's nomination without having directly competed in the primaries.\n\nThis remains most recent presidential election in which a sitting president eligible for re-election did not seek another term (and one of only two such elections to occur under the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], the first being the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 election]]), and also the last election in which any third party candidate won an entire state's electoral votes, with Wallace carrying five states.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis election was the last time until 1992 that the Democratic nominee won Connecticut, Maine, and Michigan and the last until 1988 when Washington voted Democrat, and the last time a Republican won the presidency without winning Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was also the first time since 1888 that [[bellwether]] [[Co\u00f6s County, New Hampshire]] did not support the winning candidate,<ref>The Political Graveyard; [http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/NH/CO-votes.html Co\u00f6s County Votes for President]<br />David Leip's Atlas of US Presidential Elections; [http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2016&fips=33&f=0&off=0&elect=0 Presidential Election, 2016 in New Hampshire]</ref> which has occurred again only in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]]. \n\nThis was the first time since 1928 that North Carolina voted for a Republican, and the first since 1912 (only the second time since 1852 and as of 2012, the last time) that Maine and Vermont did not support same party.\nDespite the narrow (0.7%) difference in the popular vote, Humphrey took only 35.5% of the electoral vote. This disparity prompted the introduction of the [[Electoral College (United States)#Bayh\u2013Celler Constitutional amendment|Bayh\u2013Celler Constitutional amendment]] in Congress, which would have replaced the Electoral College with a direct election of the presidency.

Multiple data cables are plugged into a switch to enable communication between different networked devices. Switches manage the flow of data across a network by transmitting a received [[network packet]] only to the one or more devices for which the packet is intended. Each networked device connected to a switch can be identified by its [[network address]], allowing the switch to direct the flow of traffic maximizing the security and efficiency of the network.\n\nA switch is more intelligent than an [[Ethernet hub]], which simply retransmits packets out of every port of the hub except the port on which the packet was received, unable to distinguish different recipients, and achieving an overall lower network efficiency.\n\nAn Ethernet switch operates at the [[data link layer]] (layer&nbsp;2) of the OSI model to create a separate [[collision domain]] for each switch port. Each device connected to a switch port can transfer data to any of the other ports at any time and the transmissions will not interfere.{{efn|In [[half duplex]] mode, each switch port can only ''either'' receive from ''or'' transmit to its connected device at a certain time. In [[full duplex]] mode, each switch port can simultaneously transmit ''and'' receive, assuming the connected device also supports full duplex mode.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2181836&seqNum=5\n | title = Cisco Networking Academy's Introduction to Basic Switching Concepts and Configuration\n | date = 2014-03-31 | accessdate = 2015-08-17\n | publisher = [[Cisco Systems]]\n}}</ref>}} Because [[Broadcasting (networking)|broadcasts]] are still being forwarded to all connected devices by the switch, the newly formed [[network segment]] continues to be a [[broadcast domain]]. Switches may also operate at higher layers of the OSI model, including the network layer and above. A device that also operates at these higher layers is known as a [[multilayer switch]].\n\nSegmentation involves the use of a switch to split a larger collision domain into smaller ones in order to reduce collision probability and to improve overall network throughput. In the extreme case (i.e. micro-segmentation), each device is located on a dedicated switch port. In contrast to an Ethernet hub, there is a separate collision domain on each of the switch ports. This allows computers to have dedicated bandwidth on point-to-point connections to the network and also to run in full-duplex mode. Full-duplex mode has only one transmitter and one receiver per collision domain, making collisions impossible.\n\nThe network switch plays an integral role in most modern Ethernet [[local area network]]s (LANs). Mid-to-large sized LANs contain a number of linked managed switches. [[Small office/home office]] (SOHO) applications typically use a single switch, or an all-purpose device such as a [[residential gateway]] to access small office/home [[broadband]] services such as [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] or [[cable Internet]]. In most of these cases, the end-user device contains a [[Router (computing)|router]] and components that interface to the particular physical broadband technology. User devices may also include a telephone interface for [[Voice over IP]] (VoIP).\n\n== Role in a network ==\nSwitches are most commonly used as the network connection point for hosts at the edge of a network. In the [[hierarchical internetworking model]] and similar network architectures, switches are also used deeper in the network to provide connections between the switches at the edge.\n\nIn switches intended for commercial use, built-in or modular interfaces make it possible to  connect different types  of  networks, including Ethernet, [[Fibre Channel]], [[RapidIO]], [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]], [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] and [[802.11]]. This connectivity can be at any of the layers mentioned. While the layer-2 functionality is adequate for bandwidth-shifting within one technology, interconnecting technologies such as Ethernet and [[token ring]] is performed more easily at layer 3 or via routing.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp0168.pdf#page=23 | title = Token-Ring to Ethernet Migration | date = February 2002 | accessdate = 2015-08-11 | author1 = Joe Efferson | author2 = Ted Gary | author3 = Bob Nevins | publisher = [[IBM]] | format = PDF | page = 13 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924111914/http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp0168.pdf#page=23 | archive-date = 2015-09-24 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Devices that interconnect at the layer&nbsp;3 are traditionally called [[Router (computing)|router]]s, so layer&nbsp;3 switches can also be regarded as relatively primitive and specialized routers.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_1-2/switch_evolution.html\n | title = The Internet Protocol Journal - Volume&nbsp;1, No.&nbsp;2: Layer&nbsp;2 and Layer&nbsp;3 Switch Evolution\n | date = September 1998 | accessdate = 2015-08-11\n | author = Thayumanavan Sridhar | publisher = [[Cisco Systems]]\n}}</ref>\n\nWhere there is a need for a great deal of analysis of network performance and security, switches may be connected between WAN routers as places for analytic modules.

Since switches can have redundant power circuits connected to [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]], the connected device can continue operating even when regular office power fails.\n\n== Layer-specific functionality ==\n[[File:Smartswitch6000.jpg|thumb|A modular network switch with three network modules (a total of 24 Ethernet and 14 Fast Ethernet ports) and one power supply.]]\n\nModern commercial switches use primarily Ethernet interfaces. The core function of an Ethernet switch is to provide multiport layer-2 bridging. Many switches also perform operations at other layers. A device capable of more than bridging is known as a multilayer switch.<!-- Let's work towards merging the details below into [[Multilayer switch]] --> Switches may learn about topologies at many layers and forward at one or more layers.\n\n=== Layer 1 ===\nA layer 1 network device transfers data but does not manage any of the traffic coming through it, an example is [[Ethernet hub]].  Any packet entering a [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] is repeated to the output of every other port except for the port of entry. Specifically, each bit or symbol is repeated as it flows in. A repeater hub can therefore only receive and forward at a single speed.<ref>Dual speed hubs internally consist of two hubs with a bridge between them.</ref> Since every packet is repeated on every other port, packet [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection|collisions]] affect the entire network, limiting its overall capacity.\n\nBy the early 2000s, there was little price difference between a hub and a low-end switch.<ref>{{cite web |title=Switches and Hubs |author=Matthew Glidden |work= About This Particular Macintosh blog |date= October 2001 |accessdate= June 9, 2011 |url=http://www.atpm.com/7.10/networking-1.shtml }}</ref> Hubs remained useful for a time for specialized applications, such supplying a copy of network traffic to a [[packet analyzer]]. A [[network tap]] may also be used for this purpose and many network switches now have a [[port mirroring]] feature that provides the same functionality.\n\n=== Layer 2 ===\n[[File:5 Port Gigabit Netzwerk-Switch TL-SG1005D 01.jpg|alt=A 5-port layer 2 switch without management functionality|thumb|Layer 2 switch without management functionality and 5 ports]]\n\n{{main|Bridging (networking)}}\n\nA layer 2 network device is a multiport device that uses hardware addresses, [[MAC address]], to process and forward data at the data link layer (layer 2).\n\nA switch operating as a network bridge may interconnect devices in a home or office. The bridge learns the [[MAC address]] of each connected device. Bridges also buffer an incoming packet and adapt the transmission speed to that of the outgoing port. While there are specialized applications, such as storage area networks, where the input and output interfaces are the same bandwidth, this is not always the case in general LAN applications. In LANs, a switch used for end-user access typically concentrates lower bandwidth and [[uplink]]s into a higher bandwidth.\n\nInterconnect between switches may be regulated using [[spanning tree protocol]] (STP) that disables links so that the resulting local area network is a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] without loops. In contrast to routers, spanning tree bridges must have topologies with only one active path between two points. [[Shortest path bridging]] is a layer 2 alternative to STP that allows all paths to be active with multiple equal cost paths.<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Shortest Path Bridging IEEE 802.1aq Overview\n |publisher    = Huawei\n |author       = Peter Ashwood-Smith\n |date         = 24 Feb 2011\n |url          = http://meetings.apnic.net/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/32007/APRICOT_SPB_Overview.pdf\n |accessdate   = 11 May 2012\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130515115628/http://meetings.apnic.net/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/32007/APRICOT_SPB_Overview.pdf\n |archive-date = 15 May 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n |title = IEEE Approves New IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Standard\n |publisher = Tech Power Up\n |date = 7 May 2012\n |url = http://www.techpowerup.com/165594/IEEE-Approves-New-IEEE-802.1aq-Shortest-Path-Bridging-Standard.html\n |accessdate = 11 May 2012\n }}</ref>\n\n=== Layer 3 ===\nA layer-3 switch can perform some or all of the functions normally performed by a [[Router (computing)|router]]. Most network switches, however, are limited to supporting a single type of physical network, typically Ethernet, whereas a router may support different kinds of physical networks on different ports.\n\nA common layer-3 capability is an awareness of [[IP multicast]] through [[IGMP snooping]]. With this awareness, a layer-3 switch can increase efficiency by delivering the traffic of a multicast group only to ports where the attached device has signaled that it wants to listen to that group.\n\nLayer-3 switches typically support [[IP routing]] between VLANs configured on the switch. Some layer-3 switches support the [[routing protocol]]s that routers use to exchange information about routes between networks.\n\n=== Layer 4 ===\nA layer-4 switch can use information in the transport-layer protocols to make forwarding decisions. Principally this refers to an ability to use source and destination port numbers in TCP and UDP communications to allow, block and prioritize communications.<ref>{{cite book |title=CCNP : building CISCO multilayer switched networks : study guide |last=Jack |first=Terry |isbn=9780585496849 |date=2004 |publisher=Sybex |page=15}}</ref>\n\n=== Layer 7 ===\nLayer-7 switches may distribute the load based on [[uniform resource locator]]s (URLs), or by using some installation-specific technique to recognize application-level transactions.

They are [[plug and play]]. They are typically the least expensive switches, and therefore often used in a [[SOHO network|small office/home office]] environment. Unmanaged switches can be desktop or rack mounted.\n*'''Managed switches''' have one or more methods to modify the operation of the switch. Common management methods include: a [[command-line interface]] (CLI) accessed via [[serial console]], [[telnet]] or [[Secure Shell]], an embedded [[Simple Network Management Protocol]] (SNMP) agent allowing management from a remote console or management station, or a web interface for management from a [[web browser]]. Examples of configuration changes that one can do from a managed switch include: enabling features such as [[Spanning Tree Protocol]] or port mirroring, setting [[Bit rate|port bandwidth]], creating or modifying [[virtual LAN]]s (VLANs), etc. Two sub-classes of managed switches are smart and enterprise managed switches. \n*'''Smart switches''' (aka intelligent switches) are managed switches with a limited set of management features. Likewise, \"web-managed\" switches are switches that fall into a market niche between unmanaged and managed. For a price much lower than a fully managed switch they provide a web interface (and usually no CLI access) and allow configuration of basic settings, such as VLANs, port-bandwidth and duplex.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hp.com/rnd/products/switches/ProCurve_Switch_1800_Series/specs.htm |title=Tech specs for a  sample HP \"web-managed\" switch |accessdate=2007-05-25 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213185114/http://www.hp.com/rnd/products/switches/ProCurve_Switch_1800_Series/specs.htm |archivedate=December 13, 2007 }}</ref> \n*'''Enterprise managed switches''' (aka managed switches) have a full set of management features, including CLI, SNMP agent, and web interface.

A device that also operates at these higher layers is known as a [[multilayer switch]].\n\nSegmentation involves the use of a switch to split a larger collision domain into smaller ones in order to reduce collision probability and to improve overall network throughput. In the extreme case (i.e. micro-segmentation), each device is located on a dedicated switch port. In contrast to an Ethernet hub, there is a separate collision domain on each of the switch ports. This allows computers to have dedicated bandwidth on point-to-point connections to the network and also to run in full-duplex mode. Full-duplex mode has only one transmitter and one receiver per collision domain, making collisions impossible.\n\nThe network switch plays an integral role in most modern Ethernet [[local area network]]s (LANs). Mid-to-large sized LANs contain a number of linked managed switches. [[Small office/home office]] (SOHO) applications typically use a single switch, or an all-purpose device such as a [[residential gateway]] to access small office/home [[broadband]] services such as [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] or [[cable Internet]]. In most of these cases, the end-user device contains a [[Router (computing)|router]] and components that interface to the particular physical broadband technology. User devices may also include a telephone interface for [[Voice over IP]] (VoIP).\n\n== Role in a network ==\nSwitches are most commonly used as the network connection point for hosts at the edge of a network. In the [[hierarchical internetworking model]] and similar network architectures, switches are also used deeper in the network to provide connections between the switches at the edge.\n\nIn switches intended for commercial use, built-in or modular interfaces make it possible to  connect different types  of  networks, including Ethernet, [[Fibre Channel]], [[RapidIO]], [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]], [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] and [[802.11]]. This connectivity can be at any of the layers mentioned. While the layer-2 functionality is adequate for bandwidth-shifting within one technology, interconnecting technologies such as Ethernet and [[token ring]] is performed more easily at layer 3 or via routing.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp0168.pdf#page=23 | title = Token-Ring to Ethernet Migration | date = February 2002 | accessdate = 2015-08-11 | author1 = Joe Efferson | author2 = Ted Gary | author3 = Bob Nevins | publisher = [[IBM]] | format = PDF | page = 13 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924111914/http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp0168.pdf#page=23 | archive-date = 2015-09-24 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Devices that interconnect at the layer&nbsp;3 are traditionally called [[Router (computing)|router]]s, so layer&nbsp;3 switches can also be regarded as relatively primitive and specialized routers.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac123/ac147/archived_issues/ipj_1-2/switch_evolution.html\n | title = The Internet Protocol Journal - Volume&nbsp;1, No.&nbsp;2: Layer&nbsp;2 and Layer&nbsp;3 Switch Evolution\n | date = September 1998 | accessdate = 2015-08-11\n | author = Thayumanavan Sridhar | publisher = [[Cisco Systems]]\n}}</ref>\n\nWhere there is a need for a great deal of analysis of network performance and security, switches may be connected between WAN routers as places for analytic modules.

Some of these functions may be on combined modules.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031007183603/http://www.checkpoint.com/support/technical/online_ug/firewall-14.0/config.htm Getting Started with Check Point Fire Wall-1], Checkpoint Software Technologies Ltd., n.d.</ref>\n\nThrough [[port mirroring]], a switch can create a mirror image of data that can go to an external device such as [[intrusion detection system]]s and [[packet sniffer]]s.\n\nA modern switch may implement [[power over Ethernet]] (PoE), which avoids the need for attached devices, such as a [[VoIP phone]] or [[wireless access point]], to have a separate power supply. Since switches can have redundant power circuits connected to [[uninterruptible power supply|uninterruptible power supplies]], the connected device can continue operating even when regular office power fails.\n\n== Layer-specific functionality ==\n[[File:Smartswitch6000.jpg|thumb|A modular network switch with three network modules (a total of 24 Ethernet and 14 Fast Ethernet ports) and one power supply.]]\n\nModern commercial switches use primarily Ethernet interfaces. The core function of an Ethernet switch is to provide multiport layer-2 bridging. Many switches also perform operations at other layers. A device capable of more than bridging is known as a multilayer switch.<!-- Let's work towards merging the details below into [[Multilayer switch]] --> Switches may learn about topologies at many layers and forward at one or more layers.\n\n=== Layer 1 ===\nA layer 1 network device transfers data but does not manage any of the traffic coming through it, an example is [[Ethernet hub]].  Any packet entering a [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] is repeated to the output of every other port except for the port of entry. Specifically, each bit or symbol is repeated as it flows in. A repeater hub can therefore only receive and forward at a single speed.<ref>Dual speed hubs internally consist of two hubs with a bridge between them.</ref> Since every packet is repeated on every other port, packet [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection|collisions]] affect the entire network, limiting its overall capacity.\n\nBy the early 2000s, there was little price difference between a hub and a low-end switch.<ref>{{cite web |title=Switches and Hubs |author=Matthew Glidden |work= About This Particular Macintosh blog |date= October 2001 |accessdate= June 9, 2011 |url=http://www.atpm.com/7.10/networking-1.shtml }}</ref> Hubs remained useful for a time for specialized applications, such supplying a copy of network traffic to a [[packet analyzer]]. A [[network tap]] may also be used for this purpose and many network switches now have a [[port mirroring]] feature that provides the same functionality.\n\n=== Layer 2 ===\n[[File:5 Port Gigabit Netzwerk-Switch TL-SG1005D 01.jpg|alt=Layer 2 switch without management functionality and 5 ports|thumb|Layer 2 switch without management functionality and 5 ports]]\n\n{{main|Bridging (networking)}}\n\nA layer 2 network device is a multiport device that uses hardware addresses, [[MAC address]], to process and forward data at the data link layer (layer 2).\n\nA switch operating as a network bridge may interconnect devices in a home or office. The bridge learns the [[MAC address]] of each connected device. Bridges also buffer an incoming packet and adapt the transmission speed to that of the outgoing port. While there are specialized applications, such as storage area networks, where the input and output interfaces are the same bandwidth, this is not always the case in general LAN applications. In LANs, a switch used for end-user access typically concentrates lower bandwidth and [[uplink]]s into a higher bandwidth.\n\nInterconnect between switches may be regulated using [[spanning tree protocol]] (STP) that disables links so that the resulting local area network is a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] without loops. In contrast to routers, spanning tree bridges must have topologies with only one active path between two points. [[Shortest path bridging]] is a layer 2 alternative to STP that allows all paths to be active with multiple equal cost paths.<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Shortest Path Bridging IEEE 802.1aq Overview\n |publisher    = Huawei\n |author       = Peter Ashwood-Smith\n |date         = 24 Feb 2011\n |url          = http://meetings.apnic.net/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/32007/APRICOT_SPB_Overview.pdf\n |accessdate   = 11 May 2012\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130515115628/http://meetings.apnic.net/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/32007/APRICOT_SPB_Overview.pdf\n |archive-date = 15 May 2013\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n |title = IEEE Approves New IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Standard\n |publisher = Tech Power Up\n |date = 7 May 2012\n |url = http://www.techpowerup.com/165594/IEEE-Approves-New-IEEE-802.1aq-Shortest-Path-Bridging-Standard.html\n |accessdate = 11 May 2012\n }}</ref>\n\n=== Layer 3 ===\nA layer-3 switch can perform some or all of the functions normally performed by a [[Router (computing)|router]]. Most network switches, however, are limited to supporting a single type of physical network, typically Ethernet, whereas a router may support different kinds of physical networks on different ports.\n\nA common layer-3 capability is an awareness of [[IP multicast]] through [[IGMP snooping]]. With this awareness, a layer-3 switch can increase efficiency by delivering the traffic of a multicast group only to ports where the attached device has signaled that it wants to listen to that group.\n\nLayer-3 switches typically support [[IP routing]] between VLANs configured on the switch. Some layer-3 switches support the [[routing protocol]]s that routers use to exchange information about routes between networks.\n\n=== Layer 4 ===\nA layer-4 switch can use information in the transport-layer protocols to make forwarding decisions. Principally this refers to an ability to use source and destination port numbers in TCP and UDP communications to allow, block and prioritize communications.<ref>{{cite book |title=CCNP : building CISCO multilayer switched networks : study guide |last=Jack |first=Terry |isbn=9780585496849 |date=2004 |publisher=Sybex |page=15}}</ref>\n\n=== Layer 7 ===\nLayer-7 switches may distribute the load based on [[uniform resource locator]]s (URLs), or by using some installation-specific technique to recognize application-level transactions.

They are [[plug and play]]. They are typically the least expensive switches, and therefore often used in a [[SOHO network|small office/home office]] environment. Unmanaged switches can be desktop or rack mounted.\n*'''Managed switches''' have one or more methods to modify the operation of the switch. Common management methods include: a [[command-line interface]] (CLI) accessed via [[serial console]], [[telnet]] or [[Secure Shell]], an embedded [[Simple Network Management Protocol]] (SNMP) agent allowing management from a remote console or management station, or a web interface for management from a [[web browser]]. Examples of configuration changes that one can do from a managed switch include: enabling features such as [[Spanning Tree Protocol]] or port mirroring, setting [[Bit rate|port bandwidth]], creating or modifying [[virtual LAN]]s (VLANs), etc. Two sub-classes of managed switches are smart and enterprise managed switches. \n*'''Smart switches''' (aka intelligent switches) are managed switches with a limited set of management features. Likewise, \"web-managed\" switches are switches that fall into a market niche between unmanaged and managed. For a price much lower than a fully managed switch they provide a web interface (and usually no CLI access) and allow configuration of basic settings, such as VLANs, port-bandwidth and duplex.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hp.com/rnd/products/switches/ProCurve_Switch_1800_Series/specs.htm |title=Tech specs for a  sample HP \"web-managed\" switch |accessdate=2007-05-25 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213185114/http://www.hp.com/rnd/products/switches/ProCurve_Switch_1800_Series/specs.htm |archivedate=December 13, 2007 }}</ref> \n*'''Enterprise managed switches''' (aka managed switches) have a full set of management features, including CLI, SNMP agent, and web interface.
