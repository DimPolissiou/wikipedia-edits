He sought an appointment to the [[United States Air Force Academy]] but was instead sent to the academy's preparatory school because of his poor grades at Santa Clara. He excelled and earned an appointment to the Academy. Instead Williams sought to leave the Air Force as a conscientious objector, and was given an honorable discharge in 1974. After that, he worked giving piano and clay sculpture and other tactile art lessons to blind children and counseling Vietnam War veterans in Los Angeles.

He served until 1982 and during that time served as President Pro-Tempore.\n\nWilliams first rose to prominence in Washington, D.C., as the District of Columbia's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) during the final term of Mayor [[Marion Barry]], who nominated Williams to the position in September 1995.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mayor Barry's Choices |work=The Washington Post |date=September 13, 1995 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-849853.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105041426/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-849853.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012}}</ref> By that time, however, Washington was in the midst of a fiscal crisis of such proportion that Congress had established a [[District of Columbia Financial Control Board|financial control board]] charged with oversight and management of the District's finances.

He brought some $40 billion of investment to the city. Unprecedented capital investments and service improvements also came to some disadvantaged neighborhoods under Williams' administration.\n\nBy 2001, real property values were climbing steadily and Washington, D.C., was experiencing a real estate investment boom in the residential, commercial and retail markets. Congress dissolved the Financial Control Board in September 2001. In 2002 the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate (AFIRE) named Washington, D.C., the top global and U.S. city for real estate investment. (It made the top slot again in 2003 and 2004.)\n\nWilliams also alienated some lower-income residents. His first term in office was marked by the beginning of a period of [[gentrification]] throughout the city. Longtime residents complained of being priced out of their homes and neighborhoods and forced to move to neighboring [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tbd.com/articles/2011/07/h-street-gentrification-and-revitalization-is-an-old-story-64140.html |title=H Street gentrification and revitalization is an old story |accessdate=August 15, 2011 |author=Kearny, Ryan |author2=Binckes, Jeremy |date=July 25, 2011 |publisher=TBD.com}}</ref> In addition, one of Williams' budget-trimming measures was the closure of [[inpatient]] services at [[D.C. General Hospital]], the only public hospital in the District. The [[Council of the District of Columbia|D.C. Council]] voted down Williams' proposed closure in the spring of 2001, but their decision was overturned by the Control Board soon afterwards.\n\n====Mayor second term====\n{{BLP sources section|date=September 2018}}\nIn 2002, Williams ran for re-election and stumbled into a political scandal. The firm which he hired to collect signatures to put his name on the Democratic Primary ballot had irregularities with hundreds of names on the [[petition]]s. As a result of the irregular petitions, the Williams campaign was fined $277,700 by the [[District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics]]<ref>{{cite news |title=D.C.

He was forced to run as a [[write-in candidate]]. His chief opponent, [[religious minister|minister]] Willie Wilson, also ran as a write-in candidate. Despite this handicap, Williams won both the Democratic and Republican primaries as a write-in candidate and went on to be re-elected in the general election.\n\nDuring his second term, Williams continued his record of stabilizing the finances of the District. The city was able to balance its budget for ten consecutive years between the 1997 and 2006 fiscal years; the cumulative fund balance swung from a deficit of $518 million in the 1996 fiscal year to a surplus of nearly $1.6 billion in the 2005 fiscal year. During this same period, the District's bond ratings went from \"junk bond\" status to \"A\" category by all three major rating agencies.\n\nWilliams was instrumental in arranging a deal to move the financially ailing [[Montr\u00e9al Expos]], a [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) team, to Washington, D.C. Although he faced opposition from much of the D.C. Council, Wiliams eventually prevailed. In late December 2004, the Council approved by one vote a financing plan for a new stadium. The new team, the [[Washington Nationals]], began playing in April 2005, the first time since 1971 that the nation's capital had its own MLB team.\n\nWhile in office, Williams was elected president of the [[National League of Cities]] in December 2004. In January 2005, he was elected Vice Chair of the [[Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments]] (COG).\n\nWilliams was not without detractors. His international traveling was criticized, as was his failure to purchase a home in D.C., despite his aggressive publicity campaign to convince residents to buy homes in the city. Some of his constituents and members of the D.C. Council (including his successor, [[Adrian M. Fenty]]) criticized Williams' deal with Major League Baseball for conceding too much and not providing a spending cap on the public financing of the new baseball park.\n\nWilliams was the first sitting mayor of Washington since 1973 to participate in a Presidential funeral in 2004, when he spoke at [[funeral of Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan's funeral]], held at [[Washington National Cathedral]].  His final speech as mayor would also come at the Cathedral in 2006.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nOn September 28, 2005, Williams announced he would not seek re-election in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mayor Williams Will Not Seek Re-Election |publisher=NBC 4, Washington, D.C. |date=September 28, 2005 |url=http://www.nbc4.com/politics/5032169/detail.html |accessdate=May 19, 2007}}</ref> Williams endorsed Council Chair [[Linda W.

Unlike many Democrats, he said he was \"open\" to [[Sam Brownback]]'s proposal to implement a [[flat tax]] in D.C., and he supported [[school vouchers]]. His public persona is that of an intellectual [[bureaucrat]], especially when compared to the colorful Barry. He is known for his signature [[bow tie]].\n\nIn 1997, ''[[Governing Magazine]]'' named him \"Public Official of the Year\".\n\nDriven by a growth in local revenues, income and sales taxes, Williams managed District resources to improve services, lower tax rates, improve the performance of city agencies and invest in infrastructure and human services.  This dramatic turnaround required transformational improvements in cash management, budget execution, and revenue collections.  After many years of declining population, the District has had a steady growth in population.  In its July 2004 issue, ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' magazine selected Washington, D.C., as the second-best city in the country for African Americans to live and work in because of its housing, jobs, health care and economic development.\n\nUnder Williams' administration, the District's crime rate dropped dramatically.  By the end of his tenure, hotels reported 2% vacancy rates.  Real estate values in the District remained high despite regional and national trends in the opposite direction.\n\nOn the eve of Williams' last day in office in 2006, ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Colbert I. King]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Williams leaves in his wake a city with a good bond rating, sizable cash reserves, a more accessible health-care system for the underserved, several promising neighborhood projects, a [[Washington Nationals|major league baseball team]], a [[Nationals Ballpark|new stadium]] under construction and a home town that is no longer the laughingstock of the nation ... On his watch, the District underwent its most profound transformation in generations. Williams promoted an investment climate that led to the sprucing up of a city that had gone to seed.<ref>{{cite news |first=Colbert I |last=King |authorlink=Colbert I.

He brought some $40 billion of investment to the city. Unprecedented capital investments and service improvements also came to some disadvantaged neighborhoods under Williams' administration.\n\nBy 2001, real property values were climbing steadily and Washington, D.C., was experiencing a real estate investment boom in the residential, commercial and retail markets. Congress dissolved the Financial Control Board in September 2001. In 2002 the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate (AFIRE) named Washington, D.C., the top global and U.S. city for real estate investment. (It made the top slot again in 2003 and 2004.)\n\nWilliams also alienated some lower-income residents. His first term in office was marked by the beginning of a period of [[gentrification]] throughout the city. Longtime residents complained of being priced out of their homes and neighborhoods and forced to move to neighboring [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tbd.com/articles/2011/07/h-street-gentrification-and-revitalization-is-an-old-story-64140.html |title=H Street gentrification and revitalization is an old story |accessdate=August 15, 2011 |author=Kearny, Ryan |author2=Binckes, Jeremy |date=July 25, 2011 |publisher=TBD.com}}</ref> In addition, one of Williams' budget-trimming measures was the closure of [[inpatient]] services at [[D.C. General Hospital]], the only public hospital in the District. The [[Council of the District of Columbia|D.C. Council]] voted down Williams' proposed closure in the spring of 2001, but their decision was overturned by the Control Board soon afterwards.\n\n====Mayor second term====\n{{BLP sources section|date=September 2018}}\nIn 2002, Williams ran for re-election and stumbled into a political scandal. The firm which he hired to collect signatures to put his name on the Democratic Primary ballot had irregularities with hundreds of names on the [[petition]]s. As a result of the irregular petitions, the Williams campaign was fined $277,700 by the [[District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics]]<ref>{{cite news |title=D.C. Election Fraud Case Advances |work=The Washington Post |date=September 15, 2005 |author=Woodlee, Yolanda |author2=Cauvin, Henri E. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/14/AR2005091402414.html |accessdate=May 19, 2007}}</ref> and his name was removed from the Democratic Primary ballot. He was forced to run as a [[write-in candidate]]. His chief opponent, [[religious minister|minister]] Willie Wilson, also ran as a write-in candidate. Despite this handicap, Williams won both the Democratic and Republican primaries as a write-in candidate and went on to be re-elected in the general election.\n\nDuring his second term, Williams continued his record of stabilizing the finances of the District. The city was able to balance its budget for ten consecutive years between the 1997 and 2006 fiscal years; the cumulative fund balance swung from a deficit of $518 million in the 1996 fiscal year to a surplus of nearly $1.6 billion in the 2005 fiscal year. During this same period, the District's bond ratings went from \"junk bond\" status to \"A\" category by all three major rating agencies.\n\nWilliams was instrumental in arranging a deal to move the financially ailing [[Montr\u00e9al Expos]], a [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) team, to Washington, D.C. Although he faced opposition from much of the D.C. Council, Wiliams eventually prevailed. In late December 2004, the Council approved by one vote a financing plan for a new stadium. The new team, the [[Washington Nationals]], began playing in April 2005, the first time since 1971 that the nation's capital had its own MLB team.\n\nWhile in office, Williams was elected president of the [[National League of Cities]] in December 2004. In January 2005, he was elected Vice Chair of the [[Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments]] (COG).\n\nWilliams was not without detractors. His international traveling was criticized, as was his failure to purchase a home in D.C., despite his aggressive publicity campaign to convince residents to buy homes in the city. Some of his constituents and members of the D.C. Council (including his successor, [[Adrian M. Fenty]]) criticized Williams' deal with Major League Baseball for conceding too much and not providing a spending cap on the public financing of the new baseball park.\n\nWilliams was the first sitting mayor of Washington since 1973 to participate in a Presidential funeral in 2004, when he spoke at [[funeral of Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan's funeral]], held at [[Washington National Cathedral]].  His final speech as mayor would also come at the Cathedral in 2006.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nOn September 28, 2005, Williams announced he would not seek re-election in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mayor Williams Will Not Seek Re-Election |publisher=NBC 4, Washington, D.C. |date=September 28, 2005 |url=http://www.nbc4.com/politics/5032169/detail.html |accessdate=May 19, 2007}}</ref> Williams endorsed Council Chair [[Linda W.

Unlike many Democrats, he said he was \"open\" to [[Sam Brownback]]'s proposal to implement a [[flat tax]] in D.C., and he supported [[school vouchers]]. His public persona is that of an intellectual [[bureaucrat]], especially when compared to the colorful Barry. He is known for his signature [[bow tie]].\n\nIn 1997, ''[[Governing Magazine]]'' named him \"Public Official of the Year\".\n\nDriven by a growth in local revenues, income and sales taxes, Williams managed District resources to improve services, lower tax rates, improve the performance of city agencies and invest in infrastructure and human services.  This dramatic turnaround required transformational improvements in cash management, budget execution, and revenue collections.  After many years of declining population, the District has had a steady growth in population.  In its July 2004 issue, ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' magazine selected Washington, D.C., as the second-best city in the country for African Americans to live and work in because of its housing, jobs, health care and economic development.\n\nUnder Williams' administration, the District's crime rate dropped dramatically.  By the end of his tenure, hotels reported 2% vacancy rates.  Real estate values in the District remained high despite regional and national trends in the opposite direction.\n\nOn the eve of Williams' last day in office in 2006, ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Colbert I. King]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Williams leaves in his wake a city with a good bond rating, sizable cash reserves, a more accessible health-care system for the underserved, several promising neighborhood projects, a [[Washington Nationals|major league baseball team]], a [[Nationals Ballpark|new stadium]] under construction and a home town that is no longer the laughingstock of the nation ... On his watch, the District underwent its most profound transformation in generations. Williams promoted an investment climate that led to the sprucing up of a city that had gone to seed.<ref>{{cite news |first=Colbert I |last=King |authorlink=Colbert I.

Diners offer a wide range of foods, mostly [[American cuisine]], a casual atmosphere, and, characteristically, a combination of booths served by a waitstaff and a long sit-down counter with direct service, in the smallest simply by a cook. Most diners have extended hours, and some along highways and areas with significant [[shift work]] stay open for 24 hours.\n \nMany diners share an archetypal exterior form.  Some of the earliest were converted rail cars, retaining their streamlined structure and interior fittings.  From the 1920s to the 1940s, diners, by then commonly known as \"lunch cars\", were usually [[prefabrication|prefabricated]] in factories, like modern [[mobile home]]s, and delivered on site with only the utilities needing to be connected. As a result, many early diners were typically small and narrow in order to fit onto a rail car or truck.  This small footprint also allowed them to be fitted into tiny and relatively inexpensive lots that otherwise were unable to support a larger enterprise.  Diners were historically [[small business]]es operated by the owner, with some presence of restaurant chains evolving over time.\n\nDiners typically serve staples of American cuisine such as [[hamburger]]s, [[french fries]], [[club sandwich]]es, and other simple, quickly cooked, and inexpensive fare, such as [[meatloaf]]. Much of the food is [[flattop grill|grilled]], as early diners were based around a gas-fueled flat-top. [[Coffee]] is a diner staple. Diners often serve hand-blended [[milkshake]]s and desserts such as [[pie]]s, which are typically displayed in a glass case. [[Comfort food]] cuisine draws heavily from, and is deeply rooted in, traditional diner fare.\n\nClassic American diners often have an exterior layer of [[stainless steel]] siding\u2014a feature unique to diner architecture. In some cases, diners share nostalgic, retro style features also found in some restored [[drive-in]]s and old [[movie theatre]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rosebud Diner.jpg|thumb|[[The Rosebud (diner)|The Rosebud]], a restored 1941 [[Worcester Lunch Car Company|Worcester Lunch Car]] #773 in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]]]]\n\nA crude precursor of the diner was created in 1872 by Walter Scott, who sold food out of a horse-pulled wagon to employees of the ''[[Providence Journal]]'', in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Scott's diner can be considered the first diner with [[Walk-up window|walk-up]] service, as it had windows on each side of the wagon.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Commercial production of such \"lunch wagons\" began in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1887, by Thomas Buckley. Buckley was successful and became known for his \"White House Cafe\" wagons. Charles Palmer received the first patent (1893) for the diner, which he billed as a \"Night-Lunch Wagon.\" He built his \"fancy night cafes\" and \"night lunch wagons\" in the Worcester area until 1901.\n\n===Prefabricated diners===\nAs the number of seats increased, wagons gave way to pre-fabricated buildings made by many of the same manufacturers which had made the wagons. Like the lunch wagon, a stationary diner allowed one to set up a food service business quickly using pre-assembled constructs and equipment.\n\nThe [[Transfer Station (Hudson County)|Transfer Station]] neighborhood of [[Union City, New Jersey]] was the site, in 1912, of the first lunch wagon built by Jerry and Daniel O'Mahoney and John Hanf, which was bought for $800 and operated by restaurant entrepreneur Michael Griffin, who chose the location for its copious foot traffic. The wagon helped spark New Jersey's golden age of diner manufacturing, which in turn made the state the diner capital of the world. In the decades that followed, nearly all major U.S. diner manufacturers, including Jerry O'Mahoney Inc., started in New Jersey.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Gabriele, Michael C.|title=Jersey Gems|magazine=[[New Jersey Monthly]]|date=May 2018|page=43}}</ref> Jerry O'Mahony (1890-1969), who hailed from [[Bayonne, New Jersey]],  is credited by some to have made the first such \"diner\".<ref>p.16 Westergaard, Barbara ''A Guide to New Jersey'' Rutgers University Press</ref> The O'Mahony Diner Company of [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], produced 2,000 diners from 1917 to 1952.  Only approximately twenty<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dinercity.com|title=Loading...|author=|date=|website=www.DinerCity.com|access-date=October 21, 2017}}</ref> remain throughout the United States and abroad.  Others more credibly credit Philip H. Duprey and Grenville Stoddard, who established the Worcester Lunch Car and Carriage Manufacturing Company in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1906, when O'Mahony was still just 16.\n\nUntil the [[Great Depression]], most diner manufacturers and their customers were located in the Northeast. Diner manufacturing suffered with other industries during the Depression, though not as much as many industries, and the diner offered a less expensive way of getting into the restaurant business as well as less expensive food than more formal establishments. After [[World War II]], as the economy returned to civilian production and the [[suburb]]s boomed, diners were an attractive [[small business]] opportunity. During this period, diners spread beyond their original urban and small town market to highway strips in the suburbs, even reaching the [[Midwest]], with manufacturers such as Valentine. After the [[Interstate Highway System]] was implemented in the U.S. in the 1960s, diners saw a boom in business as mobile travellers would stop for a meal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.curbed.com/2017/5/30/15716116/restaurants-diners-prefab-historic-preservation|title=Diners, the original prefab success story|author=|date=|website=curbed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bendix Diner.jpg|thumb|left|The Bendix Diner in [[Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey]]]]\nIn many areas, diners were superseded in the 1970s by [[fast food]] restaurants, but in parts of [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[New England]] states, [[Delaware]], and [[Pennsylvania]], the independently owned diner remains relatively common. Since the 1970s, most newly constructed diners lack the original narrow, stainless steel, streamlined appearance, and are usually much bigger buildings, though some are still made of several prefabricated modules, assembled on site, and manufactured by the old line diner builders. A wide variety of architectural styles were now used for these later diners, including [[Cape Cod (house)|Cape Cod]] and [[Colonial architecture|Colonial]] styles. The old-style single module diners featuring a long counter and a few small booths sometimes now grew additional dining rooms, lavish [[wallpaper]], fountains, crystal [[chandelier]]s and Greek statuary. The definition of the term \"diner\" began to blur as older, prefabricated diners received more conventional frame additions, sometimes leaving the original structure nearly unrecognizable as it was surrounded by new construction or a renovated [[facade]]. Businesses that called themselves diners but which were built onsite and not prefabricated began to appear. These larger establishments were sometimes known as diner-restaurants.\n\n====Manufacturers====\n* [[Bixler Manufacturing Company]]\n* [[DeRaffele Manufacturing Co.

Two Sterling Streamliners remain in operation: the [[Salem Diner]] at its original location in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] and the [[Modern Diner]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]].\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Wellsboro Diner interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of a 1938 Sterling manufactured diner, with curved ceiling, in [[Wellsboro, Pennsylvania]]]]\nLike a [[mobile home]], the original style diner is narrow and elongated and allows roadway or railway transportation to the restaurant's site. In the traditional diner floorplan, a service counter dominates the interior, with a preparation area against the back wall and floor-mounted stools for the customers in front. Larger models may have a row of booths against the front wall and at the ends. The decor varied over time. Diners of the 1920s&ndash;1940s feature [[Art Deco]] or [[Streamline Moderne]] elements or copy the appearance of rail dining cars (though very few are, in fact, refurbished rail cars).

Much of the food is grilled, as early diners were based around a [[grill (cooking)|grill]]. There is often an emphasis on [[breakfast]] foods such as [[egg (food)|eggs]] (including [[omelette]]s), [[waffle]]s, [[pancake]]s, and [[French toast]]. Like the British [[greasy spoon]], the typical American diner serves mainly fried or grilled food, for example: [[Egg (food)|fried eggs]], [[bacon]], hamburgers, [[hot dog]]s, [[hash brown]]s, waffles, pancakes, omelettes, deep fried [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[patty melt]]s, and [[sausage]]s. These are often accompanied by [[baked beans]], french fries, [[cole slaw]], or [[toast]]. Some diners serve these \"breakfast foods\" throughout the business day and others who focus on breakfast may close at around 3 pm.  These are most commonly known as [[pancake house]]s. [[Coffee]] is ubiquitous at diners, if not always of high quality. Many diners do not serve [[alcoholic drink]]s, although some may serve beer and inexpensive wine, while others\u2014particularly in New Jersey and on Long Island\u2014carry a full drink menu, including [[mixed drinks]]. Many diners serve hand-blended [[milkshake]]s. The food is usually quite inexpensive, with a decent meal (sandwich, side dish, drink) available for less than twelve dollars.\n\nThere is regional variation among diners with traditional regional American food. In [[Michigan]] and the Ohio Valley at \"[[Coney Island (restaurant)|Coney Island]]\u2013style\" restaurants, [[Coney Island hot dog|coney dogs]] are served, as are certain types of [[Greek cuisine]] like [[Gyro (food)|gyros]] influenced by Greek diner owners. In [[Indiana]] and [[Illinois]], fried pork tenderloin sandwiches are typically on the menu. The Northeast has more of a focus on seafood, with [[clams|fried clams]] and [[shrimp|fried shrimp]] commonly found in [[Maine]]. In [[Pennsylvania]], [[cheesesteak]] sandwiches and [[scrapple]] are fixtures in most diners. Diners in the southwest serve [[Tamal (dish)|tamal]]es. In the southern U.S., typical breakfast dishes include [[grits]], [[biscuits and gravy]], and [[soul food]] such as [[fried chicken]] and [[collard greens]]. In New Jersey, the \"[[Pork roll]], Egg, and Cheese Sandwich\" is a staple of many diners. Many diners have transparent display cases in or behind the counter for the [[dessert]]s. It is common with new diners to have the desserts displayed in rotating pie cases.  Typical desserts include a variety of [[pie]]s, often on view in a separate transparent case. Most diners in New York and Chicago also offer [[cheesecake]].\n\n==Immigrant influences==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n{{original research section|date=November 2017}}\nSeveral foreign ethnic influences have been introduced into the diner industry. Many diners in the United States \u2014 especially in New Jersey, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut \u2014 are owned or operated by [[Greeks|Greek]] Americans. Eastern European owners, chiefly Polish, Ukrainian, and Eastern European Jews, are also typical. [[Italian people|Italian]] Americans also have a notable presence. And in some places where there are significant [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] populations, [[Mexican people|Mexicans]] and [[Cuban people|Cubans]] may also have notable presences. These influences can be seen in certain frequent additions to diner menus, such as Greek [[moussaka]], Slavic [[blintz]]es, and Jewish [[matzah balls|matzah ball soup]], deli-style sandwiches (e.g., corned beef, pastrami, Reubens), and bagels and lox.\n\n==In media==\n[[File:Jax At The Tracks, Truckee.jpg|thumb|The diner ''Jax At The Tracks'' in [[Truckee]], California, was featured in the food reality television series ''[[Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives]]'' in June 2010]]\n[[File:John's Diner by John Baeder.jpg|thumb|[[John Baeder]], 2007, ''John's Diner with John's Chevelle'']]\n\nDiners have figured significantly in American films and television since the form developed. In ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', the episode titled 'The Diner' shows the perils, pitfalls, and difficulty in operating a diner, to much comedic effect. Archetypal appearances include significant scenes in classic films such as ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' and [[The Killers (1946 film)|''The Killers'']].  The 1982 \"rites of passage\" film [[Diner (film)|''Diner'']] was centered on an eatery shared by the protagonists.

Diners offer a wide range of foods, mostly [[American cuisine]], a casual atmosphere, and, characteristically, a combination of booths served by a waitstaff and a long sit-down counter with direct service, in the smallest simply by a cook. Most diners have extended hours, and some along highways and areas with significant [[shift work]] stay open for 24 hours.\n \nMany diners share an archetypal exterior form.  Some of the earliest were converted rail cars, retaining their streamlined structure and interior fittings.  From the 1920s to the 1940s, diners, by then commonly known as \"lunch cars\", were usually [[prefabrication|prefabricated]] in factories, like modern [[mobile home]]s, and delivered on site with only the utilities needing to be connected. As a result, many early diners were typically small and narrow in order to fit onto a rail car or truck.  This small footprint also allowed them to be fitted into tiny and relatively inexpensive lots that otherwise were unable to support a larger enterprise.  Diners were historically [[small business]]es operated by the owner, with some presence of restaurant chains evolving over time.\n\nDiners typically serve staples of American cuisine such as [[hamburger]]s, [[french fries]], [[club sandwich]]es, and other simple, quickly cooked, and inexpensive fare, such as [[meatloaf]]. Much of the food is [[flattop grill|grilled]], as early diners were based around a gas-fueled flat-top. [[Coffee]] is a diner staple. Diners often serve hand-blended [[milkshake]]s and desserts such as [[pie]]s, which are typically displayed in a glass case. [[Comfort food]] cuisine draws heavily from, and is deeply rooted in, traditional diner fare.\n\nClassic American diners often have an exterior layer of [[stainless steel]] siding\u2014a feature unique to diner architecture. In some cases, diners share nostalgic, retro style features also found in some restored [[drive-in]]s and old [[movie theatre]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rosebud Diner.jpg|thumb|[[The Rosebud (diner)|The Rosebud]], a restored 1941 [[Worcester Lunch Car Company|Worcester Lunch Car]] #773 in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]]]]\n\nA crude precursor of the diner was created in 1872 by Walter Scott, who sold food out of a horse-pulled wagon to employees of the ''[[Providence Journal]]'', in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Scott's diner can be considered the first diner with [[Walk-up window|walk-up]] service, as it had windows on each side of the wagon.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Commercial production of such \"lunch wagons\" began in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1887, by Thomas Buckley. Buckley was successful and became known for his \"White House Cafe\" wagons. Charles Palmer received the first patent (1893) for the diner, which he billed as a \"Night-Lunch Wagon.\" He built his \"fancy night cafes\" and \"night lunch wagons\" in the Worcester area until 1901.\n\n===Prefabricated diners===\nAs the number of seats increased, wagons gave way to pre-fabricated buildings made by many of the same manufacturers which had made the wagons. Like the lunch wagon, a stationary diner allowed one to set up a food service business quickly using pre-assembled constructs and equipment.\n\nThe [[Transfer Station (Hudson County)|Transfer Station]] neighborhood of [[Union City, New Jersey]] was the site, in 1912, of the first lunch wagon built by Jerry and Daniel O'Mahoney and John Hanf, which was bought for $800 and operated by restaurant entrepreneur Michael Griffin, who chose the location for its copious foot traffic. The wagon helped spark New Jersey's golden age of diner manufacturing, which in turn made the state the diner capital of the world. In the decades that followed, nearly all major U.S. diner manufacturers, including Jerry O'Mahoney Inc., started in New Jersey.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Gabriele, Michael C.|title=Jersey Gems|magazine=[[New Jersey Monthly]]|date=May 2018|page=43}}</ref> Jerry O'Mahony (1890-1969), who hailed from [[Bayonne, New Jersey]],  is credited by some to have made the first such \"diner\".<ref>p.16 Westergaard, Barbara ''A Guide to New Jersey'' Rutgers University Press</ref> The O'Mahony Diner Company of [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], produced 2,000 diners from 1917 to 1952.  Only approximately twenty<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dinercity.com|title=Loading...|author=|date=|website=www.DinerCity.com|access-date=October 21, 2017}}</ref> remain throughout the United States and abroad.  Others more credibly credit Philip H. Duprey and Grenville Stoddard, who established the Worcester Lunch Car and Carriage Manufacturing Company in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1906, when O'Mahony was still just 16.\n\nUntil the [[Great Depression]], most diner manufacturers and their customers were located in the Northeast. Diner manufacturing suffered with other industries during the Depression, though not as much as many industries, and the diner offered a less expensive way of getting into the restaurant business as well as less expensive food than more formal establishments. After [[World War II]], as the economy returned to civilian production and the [[suburb]]s boomed, diners were an attractive [[small business]] opportunity. During this period, diners spread beyond their original urban and small town market to highway strips in the suburbs, even reaching the [[Midwest]], with manufacturers such as Valentine. After the [[Interstate Highway System]] was implemented in the U.S. in the 1960s, diners saw a boom in business as mobile travellers would stop for a meal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.curbed.com/2017/5/30/15716116/restaurants-diners-prefab-historic-preservation|title=Diners, the original prefab success story|author=|date=|website=curbed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bendix Diner.jpg|thumb|left|The Bendix Diner in [[Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey]]]]\nIn many areas, diners were superseded in the 1970s by [[fast food]] restaurants, but in parts of [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[New England]] states, [[Delaware]], and [[Pennsylvania]], the independently owned diner remains relatively common. Since the 1970s, most newly constructed diners lack the original narrow, stainless steel, streamlined appearance, and are usually much bigger buildings, though some are still made of several prefabricated modules, assembled on site, and manufactured by the old line diner builders. A wide variety of architectural styles were now used for these later diners, including [[Cape Cod (house)|Cape Cod]] and [[Colonial architecture|Colonial]] styles. The old-style single module diners featuring a long counter and a few small booths sometimes now grew additional dining rooms, lavish [[wallpaper]], fountains, crystal [[chandelier]]s and Greek statuary. The definition of the term \"diner\" began to blur as older, prefabricated diners received more conventional frame additions, sometimes leaving the original structure nearly unrecognizable as it was surrounded by new construction or a renovated [[facade]]. Businesses that called themselves diners but which were built onsite and not prefabricated began to appear. These larger establishments were sometimes known as diner-restaurants.\n\n====Manufacturers====\n* [[Bixler Manufacturing Company]]\n* [[DeRaffele Manufacturing Co.

In the traditional diner floorplan, a service counter dominates the interior, with a preparation area against the back wall and floor-mounted stools for the customers in front. Larger models may have a row of booths against the front wall and at the ends. The decor varied over time. Diners of the 1920s&ndash;1940s feature [[Art Deco]] or [[Streamline Moderne]] elements or copy the appearance of rail dining cars (though very few are, in fact, refurbished rail cars). They featured porcelain enamel exteriors, some with the name written on the front, others with bands of enamel, others in flutes. Many had a \"barrel vault\" roofline. Tile floors were common. Diners of the 1950s tended to use [[stainless steel]] panels, porcelain enamel, glass blocks, [[terrazzo]] floors, [[Formica (plastic)|Formica]], and [[neon sign]] trim.

Like the British [[greasy spoon]], the typical American diner serves mainly fried or grilled food, for example: [[Egg (food)|fried eggs]], [[bacon]], hamburgers, [[hot dog]]s, [[hash brown]]s, waffles, pancakes, omelettes, deep fried [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[patty melt]]s, and [[sausage]]s. These are often accompanied by [[baked beans]], french fries, [[cole slaw]], or [[toast]]. Some diners serve these \"breakfast foods\" throughout the business day and others who focus on breakfast may close at around 3 pm.  These are most commonly known as [[pancake house]]s. [[Coffee]] is ubiquitous at diners, if not always of high quality. Many diners do not serve [[alcoholic drink]]s, although some may serve beer and inexpensive wine, while others\u2014particularly in New Jersey and on Long Island\u2014carry a full drink menu, including [[mixed drinks]]. Many diners serve hand-blended [[milkshake]]s. The food is usually quite inexpensive, with a decent meal (sandwich, side dish, drink) available for less than twelve dollars.\n\nThere is regional variation among diners with traditional regional American food. In [[Michigan]] and the Ohio Valley at \"[[Coney Island (restaurant)|Coney Island]]\u2013style\" restaurants, [[Coney Island hot dog|coney dogs]] are served, as are certain types of [[Greek cuisine]] like [[Gyro (food)|gyros]] influenced by Greek diner owners. In [[Indiana]] and [[Illinois]], fried pork tenderloin sandwiches are typically on the menu. The Northeast has more of a focus on seafood, with [[clams|fried clams]] and [[shrimp|fried shrimp]] commonly found in [[Maine]]. In [[Pennsylvania]], [[cheesesteak]] sandwiches and [[scrapple]] are fixtures in most diners. Diners in the southwest serve [[Tamal (dish)|tamal]]es. In the southern U.S., typical breakfast dishes include [[grits]], [[biscuits and gravy]], and [[soul food]] such as [[fried chicken]] and [[collard greens]]. In New Jersey, the \"[[Pork roll]], Egg, and Cheese Sandwich\" is a staple of many diners. Many diners have transparent display cases in or behind the counter for the [[dessert]]s. It is common with new diners to have the desserts displayed in rotating pie cases.  Typical desserts include a variety of [[pie]]s, often on view in a separate transparent case. Most diners in New York and Chicago also offer [[cheesecake]].\n\n==Immigrant influences==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n{{original research section|date=November 2017}}\nSeveral foreign ethnic influences have been introduced into the diner industry. Many diners in the United States \u2014 especially in New Jersey, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut \u2014 are owned or operated by [[Greeks|Greek]] Americans. Eastern European owners, chiefly Polish, Ukrainian, and Eastern European Jews, are also typical. [[Italian people|Italian]] Americans also have a notable presence. And in some places where there are significant [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] populations, [[Mexican people|Mexicans]] and [[Cuban people|Cubans]] may also have notable presences. These influences can be seen in certain frequent additions to diner menus, such as Greek [[moussaka]], Slavic [[blintz]]es, and Jewish [[matzah balls|matzah ball soup]], deli-style sandwiches (e.g., corned beef, pastrami, Reubens), and bagels and lox.\n\n==In media==\n[[File:Jax At The Tracks, Truckee.jpg|thumb|The diner ''Jax At The Tracks'' in [[Truckee]], California, was featured in the food reality television series ''[[Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives]]'' in June 2010]]\n[[File:John's Diner by John Baeder.jpg|thumb|[[John Baeder]], 2007, ''John's Diner with John's Chevelle'']]\n\nDiners have figured significantly in American films and television since the form developed. In ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', the episode titled 'The Diner' shows the perils, pitfalls, and difficulty in operating a diner, to much comedic effect. Archetypal appearances include significant scenes in classic films such as ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' and [[The Killers (1946 film)|''The Killers'']].  The 1982 \"rites of passage\" film [[Diner (film)|''Diner'']] was centered on an eatery shared by the protagonists.  ''[[Waitress (film)|Waitress]]'' in 2007 was about a [[waiting staff|waitress]] in a diner.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eater.com/2015/1/30/7934459/the-history-of-diner-waitress-uniforms|title=How Diner Waitress Uniforms Have Evolved From Scandalous Bloomers to Gingham Dresses|publisher=Eater|language=English|author=Jennifer Wright|date=30 January 2015|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> Television series include the [[Food Network]] show ''[[Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives]]''.  ''[[Pennsylvania Diners and Other Roadside Restaurants]]'', is a 1993 documentary.\n\nThe diner as an institution was iconically captured by painter Edward Hopper in his 1942 ''Nighthawks'', a vignette mimicked by a movie lead-in aired nightly on the [[Turner Classic Movies|Turner Classic Movie Channel]].  Diners are the focus of [[Photorealism|photorealist]] painter [[John Baeder]] who spent about 40 years painting diners across the US.\n\n==Pinball machine==\nIn [[1990]], [[WMS Industries]] (then known as Williams) introduced a [[pinball machine]] entitled ''Diner.''

Different types of hawks choose separate times in each season to migrate. The autumn migrating season begins in August and ends mid-December. It has been studied that there are longer migration distances than others. The long-distance travelers tend to begin in early autumn while the short distance travelers start much later. Thus, the longer the distance the earlier the bird begins its journey. There have been studies on the speed and efficiency of the bird's migration that show that it is better for a hawk to arrive at its destination as early as possible.<ref name=\"Migration of Hawks\">{{cite book|last=Heintzelman|first=Donald S.|title=The Migration of Hawks|year=1986|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|pages=40}}</ref> This is because the first bird that arrives has the first pick of mates, living area, food, and survival necessities. The more fat a bird has when it starts its migration, the better chance it has of making the trip safely. Kerlinger states that studies have shown that a bird has more body fat when it begins its migration, before it leaves, than when has arrived at its destination.<ref name=\"Flight Strategies\"/>\n\nOne of the most important parts of the hawk's migration is the flight direction because the direction or path the bird chooses to take could greatly affect its migration. The force of wind is a variable because it could either throw the bird off course or push it in the right direction, depending on the direction of the wind.<ref name=\"Flight Strategies\">{{cite book|last=Kerlinger|first=Paul|title=Flight Strategies of Migrating Hawks|year=1989|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=57\u201358,153}}</ref> To ensure a safer journey, a hawk tries to avoid any large bodies of water in the spring and fall by detouring around a lake or flying along a border.<ref name=\"Soaring Hawks\">{{cite book|last=Heitzelman|first=Donald S.|title=Hawks & Owls in Eastern North America|year=2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick|pages=96\u201398}}</ref>\n\n[[Hawkwatching]] is a citizen scientist activity that monitors hawk migration and provides data to the scientific community.\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n{{See also|List of Falconiformes by population}}\n\nThe [[red-tailed hawk]] is the most common hawk in [[North America]]. Past observations have indicated that while hawks can easily adapt to any surrounding, hawks prefer a habitat that is open. Hawks usually like to live in places like deserts and fields, likely as it is easier to find prey. As they are able to live anywhere, they can be found in mountainous plains and tropical, moist areas. Hawks have been found in places such as [[Central America]], the [[West Indies]], and [[Jamaica]].\n\n==Behaviour==\n\nStarting in the hawk's early life, it is fed by its parents until it leaves the nest.<ref name=\"National Geographic\" /> The young hawk, while still in its fledgling phase, will leave its nest as early as six weeks old. Once the bird is older it begins to hunt. The hawk kills its prey with its talons as opposed to other [[predator]] [[birds]], such as the [[falcon]]. The falcon uses its talons to catch the prey but kills the small animal with its beak instead of its talons.<ref name=\"Characteristics and Behaviour\" /> The hawk's preferred time for hunting is usually just before nightfall when daylight lessens.<ref name=\"Migration of Hawks\"/> Although the hawk is known for being a violent [[predator]], some are gentle and quiet.<ref name=\"Characteristics and Behaviour\">{{cite web|title=Hawks-Characteristics and Behaviour|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/3229/Hawks-Characteristics-behavior.html|publisher=Net Industries|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref> When it flies, the hawk flaps its wings rapidly, and then uses that momentum to glide smoothly and gracefully through the air.<ref name=\"Soaring Hawks\"/>\n\nThe idea of flocking during migration has been closely analyzed, and it has been concluded that it is a commutative tool used by birds and other animals to increase survival. It has become clear to observers that a hawk traveling in a flock have a greater chance of [[Life|survival]] than if it travelled alone. Another word used in the [[United States]] that has the same meaning as \"flock,\" particularly in terms of groups of hawks, is \"kettle.\"<ref name=\"Flight Strategies\"/>{{rp|215\u201316}}\n\n==Reproduction==\n\nHawks are known for their unique [[mating season]]. The method the hawk uses to [[reproduce]] is different from most. The male and female will fly together in a circular motion. Once they reach a certain height, the male will dive toward the female and then they will raise back to the height again. The two birds will repeat this until finally the male latches onto the female and they begin to free-fall down to earth. In one year, a female hawk will lay about five eggs. Both the male and the female will cater and take care of the [[egg (biology)|eggs]] for about a month until they hatch.<ref name=\"National Geographic\" /> The male and the female create their nest before the mating season and improve it together during the nesting season. The two birds usually make their nest prior to mating. Some species of hawks tend to be [[monogamous]] and stay with the same mating partner their whole lives.<ref name=\"Soaring Hawks\"/>\n\n==Diet==\n[[File:Red-tailed Hawk Eating a Rodent 1080p 60fps.ogv|thumb|[[Red-tailed hawk]] removing fur from a [[rodent]] before eating the rodent at [[Mission Peak Regional Preserve]], [[California]]]]\nA hawk's [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] is predictable and includes a variety of smaller animals.

Hawks are widely distributed and vary greatly in size.\n\n* The [[subfamily]] [[Accipitrinae]] includes [[goshawk]]s, [[sparrowhawk]]s, [[sharp-shinned hawk]]s and others. This subfamily are mainly woodland birds with long tails and high visual acuity. They hunt by dashing suddenly from a concealed perch.<ref>Campbell, B., Lack.E (2013) A Dictionary of Birds.  p.273</ref>\n* In the [[Americas]], members of the ''[[Buteo]]'' group are also called hawks; this group are called [[buzzard]]s in other parts of the world. Generally, buteos have broad wings and sturdy builds. They are relatively larger-winged, shorter-tailed and fly further distances in open areas than accipiters. Buteos descend or pounce on their prey rather than hunting in a fast horizontal pursuit.\n\nThe terms ''accipitrine hawk'' and ''buteonine hawk'' are used to distinguish between the types in regions where ''hawk'' applies to both. The term ''\"true hawk\"''  is sometimes used for the accipitrine hawks in regions where ''buzzard'' is preferred for the buteonine hawks.\n\nAll these groups are members of the [[Accipitridae]] family, which includes the hawks and buzzards as well as [[Kite (bird)|kite]]s, [[harrier (bird)|harrier]]s and [[eagle]]s.

This is due to the large number of [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s in the [[retina]] (up to 1,000,000 per square mm in ''Buteo'', compared to 200,000 in [[humans]]), a high number of [[Neuron|nerves]] connecting these receptors to the brain, and an indented [[Fovea centralis|fovea]], which magnifies the central portion of the [[visual field]].<ref>{{cite web  | title = Hawks | publisher = beautyofbirds.com   | url = http://www.beautyofbirds.com/hawks.htm  | accessdate = 2010-01-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Kirschbaum | first = Kari | title = Family Accipitridae | work = AnimalDiversity Web | publisher = University of Michigan Museum of Zoology  | url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Accipitridae.html  | accessdate = 2010-01-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Hawk in Kurdistan.jpg|250px|thumb|A Hawk in flight]]\nHawks are known to have sharp vision and to be able hunters.<ref name=\"National Geographic\">{{cite journal|title=Red-Tailed Hawk|journal=National Geographic|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/red-tailed-hawk/|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref> The female is generally larger than the male.\n\n==Migration==\n\nLike most birds, the hawk migrates in the autumn and the spring. Different types of hawks choose separate times in each season to migrate. The autumn migrating season begins in August and ends mid-December. It has been studied that there are longer migration distances than others. The long-distance travelers tend to begin in early autumn while the short distance travelers start much later. Thus, the longer the distance the earlier the bird begins its journey. There have been studies on the speed and efficiency of the bird's migration that show that it is better for a hawk to arrive at its destination as early as possible.<ref name=\"Migration of Hawks\">{{cite book|last=Heintzelman|first=Donald S.|title=The Migration of Hawks|year=1986|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|pages=40}}</ref> This is because the first bird that arrives has the first pick of mates, living area, food, and survival necessities. The more fat a bird has when it starts its migration, the better chance it has of making the trip safely. Kerlinger states that studies have shown that a bird has more body fat when it begins its migration, before it leaves, than when has arrived at its destination.<ref name=\"Flight Strategies\"/>\n\nOne of the most important parts of the hawk's migration is the flight direction because the direction or path the bird chooses to take could greatly affect its migration. The force of wind is a variable because it could either throw the bird off course or push it in the right direction, depending on the direction of the wind.<ref name=\"Flight Strategies\">{{cite book|last=Kerlinger|first=Paul|title=Flight Strategies of Migrating Hawks|year=1989|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=57\u201358,153}}</ref> To ensure a safer journey, a hawk tries to avoid any large bodies of water in the spring and fall by detouring around a lake or flying along a border.<ref name=\"Soaring Hawks\">{{cite book|last=Heitzelman|first=Donald S.|title=Hawks & Owls in Eastern North America|year=2004|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick|pages=96\u201398}}</ref>\n\n[[Hawkwatching]] is a citizen scientist activity that monitors hawk migration and provides data to the scientific community.\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n{{See also|List of Falconiformes by population}}\n\nThe [[red-tailed hawk]] is the most common hawk in [[North America]]. Past observations have indicated that while hawks can easily adapt to any surrounding, hawks prefer a habitat that is open. Hawks usually like to live in places like deserts and fields, likely as it is easier to find prey. As they are able to live anywhere, they can be found in mountainous plains and tropical, moist areas. Hawks have been found in places such as [[Central America]], the [[West Indies]], and [[Jamaica]].\n\n==Behaviour==\n\nStarting in the hawk's early life, it is fed by its parents until it leaves the nest.<ref name=\"National Geographic\" /> The young hawk, while still in its fledgling phase, will leave its nest as early as six weeks old. Once the bird is older it begins to hunt. The hawk kills its prey with its talons as opposed to other [[predator]] [[birds]], such as the [[falcon]]. The falcon uses its talons to catch the prey but kills the small animal with its beak instead of its talons.<ref name=\"Characteristics and Behaviour\" /> The hawk's preferred time for hunting is usually just before nightfall when daylight lessens.<ref name=\"Migration of Hawks\"/> Although the hawk is known for being a violent [[predator]], some are gentle and quiet.<ref name=\"Characteristics and Behaviour\">{{cite web|title=Hawks-Characteristics and Behaviour|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/3229/Hawks-Characteristics-behavior.html|publisher=Net Industries|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref> When it flies, the hawk flaps its wings rapidly, and then uses that momentum to glide smoothly and gracefully through the air.<ref name=\"Soaring Hawks\"/>\n\nThe idea of flocking during migration has been closely analyzed, and it has been concluded that it is a commutative tool used by birds and other animals to increase survival. It has become clear to observers that a hawk traveling in a flock have a greater chance of [[Life|survival]] than if it travelled alone. Another word used in the [[United States]] that has the same meaning as \"flock,\" particularly in terms of groups of hawks, is \"kettle.\"<ref name=\"Flight Strategies\"/>{{rp|215\u201316}}\n\n==Reproduction==\n\nHawks are known for their unique [[mating season]]. The method the hawk uses to [[reproduce]] is different from most. The male and female will fly together in a circular motion. Once they reach a certain height, the male will dive toward the female and then they will raise back to the height again. The two birds will repeat this until finally the male latches onto the female and they begin to free-fall down to earth. In one year, a female hawk will lay about five eggs. Both the male and the female will cater and take care of the [[egg (biology)|eggs]] for about a month until they hatch.<ref name=\"National Geographic\" /> The male and the female create their nest before the mating season and improve it together during the nesting season. The two birds usually make their nest prior to mating. Some species of hawks tend to be [[monogamous]] and stay with the same mating partner their whole lives.<ref name=\"Soaring Hawks\"/>\n\n==Diet==\n[[File:Red-tailed Hawk Eating a Rodent 1080p 60fps.ogv|thumb|[[Red-tailed hawk]] removing fur from a [[rodent]] before eating the rodent at [[Mission Peak Regional Preserve]], [[California]]]]\nA hawk's [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] is predictable and includes a variety of smaller animals. Some of these small animals include [[snakes]], [[lizards]], [[fish]], [[mice]], [[rabbits]], [[squirrels]], [[birds]], and any other type of small game that is found on the ground.<ref name=\"National Geographic\" /> More specifically, a [[red-shouldered hawk]] likes to eat smaller birds like [[doves]] and bugs like [[grasshopper]]s and [[crickets]].<ref name=\"Soaring Hawks\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{further information|Falconry}}\n\nA ''[[war hawk]]'', or simply ''hawk'', is a term used in politics for somebody favouring war.\n\nNumerous sporting clubs, such as the [[Atlanta Hawks]], the [[Hawthorn Hawks]] and the [[Malm\u00f6 Redhawks]], use the bird as an emblem.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Hawks}}\n{{Wiktionary|hawk}}\n* [http://ibc.lynxeds.com/family/hawks-eagles-accipitridae Hawks and eagles (Accipitridae)] information, videos, photos and sounds at the Internet Bird Collection\n* {{Cite Americana|wstitle=Hawk |short=x}}\n* {{Cite EB1911|short=x|wstitle=Hawk|volume=13|pages=94\u201395}}\n* {{Cite NSRW|short=x|wstitle=Hawk}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Birds of prey]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Bird common names]]\n", "name_user": "202.188.33.1", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(Badygxymcy)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk"}
