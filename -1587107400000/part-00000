No other allegations about sexual assault surfaced in the course of this reporting, nor did any former Biden staff members corroborate any details of Reade's allegation, although several of the seven women stated that they believed Reade but had no new knowledge of the incident.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Two friends of Reade confirmed to ''The New York Times'' that she had told them of the alleged assault (one in 1993 shortly after the alleged assault took place, the other in 2008). Reade's brother has also publicly stated that she had told him about it,<ref name=\"nyt\" /> initially saying that Reade told him that Biden had touched her neck and shoulders, but several days later he told ''The Washington Post'' that he also remembered that she had said that Biden had reached \"under her clothes.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ruth |first1=Marcus |title=Assessing Tara Reade's allegations |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/15/seriousness-flaws-tara-reades-allegations/ |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe newspaper's reporters additionally interviewed the chief and deputy-chief of Biden's Senate staff during 1992 and 1993 as well as its long-term executive assistant.

Rickard''''', 572 U.S. ___ (2014), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving the [[use of force]] by [[police officer]]s during high-speed [[car chase]]s. After first holding that it had [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case, the Court held that the conduct of the police officers involved in the case did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]].\n\nAt midnight on July 18, 2004, Donald Rickard led police officers on a high-speed car chase which ended in a parking lot, where officers fired fifteen shots into Rickard's car. Rickard and his passenger both died from a combination of gunshot wounds and injuries sustained when the car eventually crashed. Rickard's daughter sued the officers who shot Rickard, arguing that they had used [[excessive force]] in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The officers moved for [[summary judgment]] based on [[qualified immunity]] because they believed their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the car chase. The district court denied this motion, and the court of appeals affirmed.\n\nOn May 27, 2014, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the officers did not violate the Fourth Amendment. In a unanimous (9\u20130) decision authored by [[Justice Samuel Alito]],{{efn|name=opinionbreakdown}} the Court found that Rickard's actions posed a \"grave public safety risk\" and that the officers \"acted reasonably in using deadly force to end that risk\". The Court also found that the number of shots fired was also reasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\". Finally, the Court found that even if the officers' conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, they would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity because their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the incident.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Prior case law ===\nThe [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] by the federal government, and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extends this prohibition to state governments under the [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation doctrine]]. In the course of their duties, police officers must sometimes make split-second decisions in situations where they believe there is a serious threat to the lives of themselves or the public. The [[use of force]] by police officers to counter such threats constitutes a seizure in the eyes of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court has previously held in such cases as ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' (1985) and ''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' (1989) that the use of force, including deadly force, by a police officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment if it is \"objectively reasonable\" in light of the circumstances confronting them.<ref>Ross, p. 246</ref>\n\nIn the past, the Supreme Court has also examined the use of force against fleeing motorists specifically. In ''[[Brosseau v. Haugen]]'' (2004), the Supreme Court upheld the use of force by a police officer who fired her gun into the back of a suspect's car after chasing the suspect on foot.<ref>Ross, p. 247\u201348</ref> The Court has also held in ''[[Scott v. Harris]]'' (2007) that a \"police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.\"<ref>''Scott v. Harris'', 550 U.S. 372 (2007), [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-1631.pdf slip op.] at 13 (U.S. April 30, 2007).</ref> In both cases, the Court confirmed that the standard of review for force against fleeing motorists is the same \"objective reasonableness\" standard as that in ''Graham v. Connor''.<ref>Ross, p. 248</ref>\n\nIf a person believes that the use of force against them is unjustified, [[42 U.S.C. \u00a71983]] allows them to file a civil action, claiming a violation of their constitutional rights. In general, police officers are protected from individual liability from these claims by the [[qualified immunity]] doctrine, which prevents government officials, including police officers, from being held individually liable for federal civil rights violations unless their conduct violated clearly established law at the time in question.<ref>Ross, p. 248</ref> In ''[[Johnson v. Jones]]'' (1995), the Supreme Court held that a defendant entitled to qualified immunity in these kinds of cases cannot immediately appeal a [[United States district court|district court]]'s order regarding a motion for [[summary judgment]] \"insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial\".<ref>''Johnson v. Jones'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/515/304/case.pdf 515 U.S. 304] (1995), (U.S. June 12, 1995).</ref>\n\n=== Facts of the case ===\nAt around midnight on July 18, 2004, a lieutenant of the [[West Memphis, Arkansas]], Police Department pulled over a white Honda Accord driven by Donald Rickard because the car had only one working headlight. There was also a passenger named Kelly Allen in the car's passenger seat. During the [[traffic stop]], the lieutenant asked Rickard to step out of the car because he appeared nervous and failed to produce a driver license when asked. Instead of doing so, Rickard decided to speed away from the officer. The lieutenant, later joined by other officers, pursued Rickard in a high-speed car chase down [[Interstate 40]], exceeding speeds over 100 miles per hour.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 2.</ref> The entire chase lasted approximately five minutes. According to a video of the car chase, Rickard nearly struck 29 other drivers, struck two different patrol cars, and nearly struck another patrol car. Rickard drove east, crossing the Mississippi River into Tennessee. The officers attempted unsuccessfully to use a \"[[rolling roadblock]]\" to stop Rickard.<ref name=\":2\">Ross, p. 251.</ref>\n\nAfter exiting Interstate 40, Rickard collided with the cruiser of one of the officers and spun out into a parking lot in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"plumhoff3\" /> After Rickard temporarily stopped next to a building, officers approached Rickard's car on foot; Rickard then began to back up, and an officer pounded against his passenger-side window with his firearm.<ref name=\":2\" /> Rickard then collided with another police cruiser, and even though Rickard's bumper was flush against the cruiser, he continued to use his accelerator. At this point, Sergeant Vance Plumhoff fired three shots into Rickard's car. Then, as Rickard continued \"fleeing down\" a street, officers fired twelve additional shots in the direction of Rickard's car, making the total number of shots fired in the incident fifteen. Rickard then lost control and crashed into a building. He and his passenger died from a combination of gunshot wounds and crash injuries.<ref name=\"plumhoff3\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 3.</ref>\n\n=== Lower court proceedings ===\n\nWhitne Rickard, Rickard's [[Minor (law)|minor]] daughter, filed a legal action under [[42 U.S.C. \u00a71983]] against Plumhoff and the other officers, as well as the chief of police and the mayor, alleging that the officers had violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by using excessive force against her father and his passenger.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"plumhoff3\" /> The officers filed a motion for [[summary judgment]] on the basis of [[qualified immunity]]. The [[U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee]] denied this motion, holding that the officers' conduct violated clearly established law at the time of the incident. Before the case could proceed, the officers appealed the district court's denial to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]], which initially dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, citing the Supreme Court's decision in ''Johnson v. Jones'', but later vacated that judgment and instead affirmed the District Court's holding.<ref name=\"plumhoff4\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 4.</ref>\n\n== Supreme Court ==\n[[File:Samuel Alito official photo.jpg|thumb|Justice Samuel Alito wrote the unanimous opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court in ''Plumhoff v.

Harris''\", and (2) \"whether the Sixth Circuit erred in denying qualified immunity by finding the use of force was not reasonable as a matter of law\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/12-01117qp.pdf|title=12-1117 Plumhoff v.

Writing for a unanimous Court,{{Efn|The Court's decision was unanimous (9\u20130) except that Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] did not join parts III\u2013A and III\u2013B, and Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] did not join part III\u2013B\u20132.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 1.</ref> The Supreme Court's opinion is divided as follows. \n* Part I describes the facts of the case and the lower court proceedings.\n* In Part II, the Court holds that it has jurisdiction to hear this case.\n* In Part III\u2013A, the Court explains why it was beginning its legal analysis with whether a constitutional right was actually violated.\n* In Part III\u2013B\u20131, the Court holds that the police did not violate the Fourth Amendment by using deadly force to end the high-speed car chase.\n* In Part III\u2013B\u20132, the Court rejects the argument that number of shots fired in this case was unreasonable, even if it was reasonable to use deadly force.\n* In Part III\u2013C, the Court holds that even if the officers' conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, they \"would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity\".|name=opinionbreakdown|group=}} Alito began by addressing whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear the case as an [[interlocutory appeal]].{{Efn|An [[interlocutory appeal]] is a type of appeal that occurs in the middle of a trial court's proceeding, while other aspects of the case are still pending. In the case of ''Plumhoff v. Rickard'', the police officers appealed the district court's order denying [[summary judgment]] on qualified immunity. Because the officers appealed the case immediately after this order, without waiting for the case to proceed to trial, the appeal is considered \"interlocutory\".}} In general, federal law (specifically 28 U.S.C. \u00a71291) only allows courts of appeals to hear appeals from the \"final decisions\" of district courts, and Alito acknowledged that an order denying summary judgment \"is generally not a final decision within the meaning of \u00a71291 and is thus generally not immediately appealable\".<ref name=\":0\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 5.</ref> However, summary judgments based on qualified immunity are an exception to this general rule, since qualified immunity is \"an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Alito rejected the respondent's argument that the Court's decision in ''Johnson v. Jones'' prevents Court from having jurisdiction in this case, stating that in ''Johnson'', the summary judgment order was not appealable because \"it merely decided 'a question of evidence sufficiency', ''i.e.'' which facts a party may, or may not, be able to prove at trial\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 6.</ref> In the case of ''Plumhoff v. Jones'', however, the officers raised legal issues, and Alito stated that \"deciding legal issues of this sort is a core responsibility of appellate courts\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nMoving onto the legal questions, Alito first explained why he was beginning his analysis of whether the officers' violated \"clearly established law\" by first answering whether the officers' actually violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures, citing the Court's decision in ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]'' (2001).<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 7.</ref> Examining the facts of the case \"from the perspective 'of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with 20/20 vision of hindsight'\", Alito concluded that the officers had acted reasonably and had not violated the Fourth Amendment.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 8\u201310.</ref> Alito wrote there was \"no basis for reach a different conclusion\" from the Court's decision in ''Scott v. Harris'', stating that \"Rickard's outrageously reckless driving posed a grave public safety risk\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 10.</ref> Furthermore, Alito rejected the respondent's argument that even if the officers were justified in using deadly force, the degree of force that the officers used when firing 15 shots into Rickard's car was unreasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\".<ref name=\":1\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 11.</ref> The presence of a passenger in Rickard's car does not affect this analysis because the question in the case is \"whether petitioners violated Rickard\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, not Allen\u2019s\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Finally, Alito wrote that even if the officers' conduct had violated the Fourth Amendment, they \"would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 12.</ref>\n\n== Analysis and reception ==\n\n=== Implications ===\n\nIn a legal analysis published in ''[[Criminal Justice Review]]'', a peer-reviewed academic journal published by [[SAGE Publishing]], Darrell L. Ross of [[Valdosta State University]] discussed the legal and practical implications of ''Plumhoff''. According to Ross, \"lower courts are reminded of how to assess issues pertaining to qualified immunity, particularly in use of force cases\".<ref name=\":3\">Ross p. 254</ref> Specifically, the \"correct standard, as reiterated by the Court\u2014which was never discussed by the Sixth Circuit\u2014is whether the right was sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood what he or she is doing violates that right.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, Ross wrote that police are also reminded of the Court's principles regarding the use of deadly force in accordance with ''Graham'', especially as it pertains to fleeing motorists. Specifically, Ross wrote, \"Whether force appears reasonable is measured from the perspective of the officer at the moment the officer decided to use it.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Ross also emphasized the implications of the Court's analysis over the number of rounds fired. Ross commented that police officers \"are not trained or required to shoot to wound, nor are they trained to shoot warning shots prior to responding with deadly force.\"<ref name=\":4\">Ross, p. 255</ref> According to Ross, \"Justice Alito confirmed the fact officers are trained to keep shooting until the threat is stopped ...\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Finally, Ross wrote, \"Police administrators are encouraged to review and revise their current use of force and pursuit policies consistent with this decision.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Ross recommended that \"administrators should provide training to their officers on use of force legal issues and principles that emerge from ''Rickard'', ''Graham'', ''Scott'', and ''Brosseau''\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Reactions and criticism ===\n\n[[Erwin Chemerinsky]], the dean of the [[University of California, Irvine School of Law]], wrote an opinion piece published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', in which he described the Court's decision as \"deeply disturbing\", arguing that there are alternatives to shooting at vehicles involves in high-speed car chases and that the Court has \"weakened accountability by ruling that a local government can be held liable only if it is proved that the city\u2019s or county\u2019s own policy violated the Constitution\".<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |last1=Chemerinsky |first1=Erwin |title=Opinion {{!}} How the Supreme Court Protects Bad Cops |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/opinion/how-the-supreme-court-protects-bad-cops.html |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |date=26 August 2014 |page=A23}}</ref> In the article, Chemerinsky also opposed the doctrine of qualified immunity, arguing that it poses an unreasonable burden for individuals alleging violations of constitutional rights.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> In a blog post published in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', Jonathan R. Nash, a professor of law at [[Emory University School of Law]], argued that the Court's decision in ''Plumhoff'' was inconsistent with the precedent it set in ''Scott'', commenting that the Court \"jettisoned ''Scott''<nowiki/>'s careful balancing in favor of an approach designed to give the police substantial leeway in terminating chases\".<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/215291-high-speed-police-pursuits-and-deadly-force|title=High-speed police pursuits and deadly force|last=Nash|first=Jonathan R.|date=August 19, 2014|website=The Hill|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414175726/https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/215291-high-speed-police-pursuits-and-deadly-force|archive-date=April 14, 2018|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> Nash stated there were differences between the facts in ''Plumhoff'' versus the facts in ''Scott'', which he felt should have compelled the Court to a different conclusion.

Rickard''''', 572 U.S. ___ (2014), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving the [[use of force]] by [[police officer]]s during high-speed [[car chase]]s. After first holding that it had [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case, the Court held that the conduct of the police officers involved in the case did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]].\n\nAt midnight on July 18, 2004, Donald Rickard led police officers on a high-speed car chase which ended in a parking lot, where officers fired fifteen shots into Rickard's car. Rickard and his passenger both died from a combination of gunshot wounds and injuries sustained when the car eventually crashed. Rickard's daughter sued the officers who shot Rickard, arguing that they had used [[excessive force]] in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The officers moved for [[summary judgment]] based on [[qualified immunity]] because they believed their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the car chase. The district court denied this motion, and the court of appeals affirmed.\n\nOn May 27, 2014, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the officers did not violate the Fourth Amendment. In a unanimous (9\u20130) decision authored by [[Justice Samuel Alito]],{{efn|name=opinionbreakdown}} the Court found that Rickard's actions posed a \"grave public safety risk\" and that the officers \"acted reasonably in using deadly force to end that risk\". The Court also found that the number of shots fired was also reasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\". Finally, the Court found that even if the officers' conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, they would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity because their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the incident.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Prior case law ===\nThe [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] by the federal government, and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extends this prohibition to state governments under the [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation doctrine]]. In the course of their duties, police officers must sometimes make split-second decisions in situations where they believe there is a serious threat to the lives of themselves or the public. The [[use of force]] by police officers to counter such threats constitutes a seizure in the eyes of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court has previously held in such cases as ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' (1985) and ''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' (1989) that the use of force, including deadly force, by a police officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment if it is \"objectively reasonable\" in light of the circumstances confronting them.<ref>Ross, p. 246</ref>\n\nIn the past, the Supreme Court has also examined the use of force against fleeing motorists specifically. In ''[[Brosseau v. Haugen]]'' (2004), the Supreme Court upheld the use of force by a police officer who fired her gun into the back of a suspect's car after chasing the suspect on foot.<ref>Ross, p. 247\u201348</ref> In the U.S. Supreme Court has also held in ''[[Scott v. Harris]]'' (2007) that a \"police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.\"<ref>''Scott v. Harris'', 550 U.S. 372 (2007), [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-1631.pdf slip op.] at 13 (U.S. April 30, 2007).</ref> In both cases, the Court confirmed that the standard of review for force against fleeing motorists is the same \"objective reasonableness\" standard as that in ''Graham v. Connor''.<ref>Ross, p. 248</ref>\n\nIf a person believes that the use of force against them is unjustified, [[42 U.S.C. \u00a71983]] allows them to file a civil action, claiming a violation of their constitutional rights. In general, police officers are protected from individual liability from these claims by the [[qualified immunity]] doctrine, which prevents government officials, including police officers, from being held individually liable for federal civil rights violations unless their conduct violated clearly established law at the time in question.<ref>Ross, p. 248</ref> In ''[[Johnson v. Jones]]'' (1995), the Supreme Court held that a defendant entitled to qualified immunity in these kinds of cases cannot immediately appeal a [[United States district court|district court]]'s order regarding a motion for [[summary judgment]] \"insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial\".<ref>''Johnson v. Jones'', [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/515/304/case.pdf 515 U.S. 304] (1995), (U.S. June 12, 1995).</ref>\n\n=== Facts of the case ===\nAt around midnight on July 18, 2004, a lieutenant of the [[West Memphis, Arkansas]], Police Department pulled over a white Honda Accord driven by Donald Rickard because the car had only one working headlight. There was also a passenger named Kelly Allen in the car's passenger seat. During the [[traffic stop]], the lieutenant asked Rickard to step out of the car because he appeared nervous and failed to produce a driver license when asked. Instead of doing so, Rickard decided to speed away from the officer. The lieutenant, later joined by other officers, pursued Rickard in a high-speed car chase down [[Interstate 40]], exceeding speeds over 100 miles per hour.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 2.</ref> The entire chase lasted approximately five minutes. According to a video of the car chase, Rickard nearly struck 29 other drivers, struck two different patrol cars, and nearly struck another patrol car. Rickard drove east, crossing the Mississippi River into Tennessee. The officers attempted unsuccessfully to use a \"[[rolling roadblock]]\" to stop Rickard.<ref name=\":2\">Ross, p. 251.</ref>\n\nAfter exiting Interstate 40, Rickard collided with the cruiser of one of the officers and spun out into a parking lot in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"plumhoff3\" /> After Rickard temporarily stopped next to a building, officers approached Rickard's car on foot; Rickard then began to back up, and an officer pounded against his passenger-side window with his firearm.<ref name=\":2\" /> Rickard then collided with another police cruiser, and even though Rickard's bumper was flush against the cruiser, he continued to use his accelerator. At this point, Sergeant Vance Plumhoff fired three shots into Rickard's car. Then, as Rickard continued \"fleeing down\" a street, officers fired twelve additional shots in the direction of Rickard's car, making the total number of shots fired in the incident fifteen. Rickard then lost control and crashed into a building. He and his passenger died from a combination of gunshot wounds and crash injuries.<ref name=\"plumhoff3\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 3.</ref>\n\n=== Lower court proceedings ===\n\nWhitne Rickard, Rickard's [[Minor (law)|minor]] daughter, filed a legal action under [[42 U.S.C. \u00a71983]] against Plumhoff and the other officers, as well as the chief of police and the mayor, alleging that the officers had violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by using excessive force against her father and his passenger.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"plumhoff3\" /> The officers filed a motion for [[summary judgment]] on the basis of [[qualified immunity]]. The [[U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee]] denied this motion, holding that the officers' conduct violated clearly established law at the time of the incident. Before the case could proceed, the officers appealed the district court's denial to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]], which initially dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, citing the Supreme Court's decision in ''Johnson v. Jones'', but later vacated that judgment and instead affirmed the District Court's holding.<ref name=\"plumhoff4\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 4.</ref>\n\n== Supreme Court ==\n[[File:Samuel Alito official photo.jpg|thumb|Justice Samuel Alito wrote the unanimous opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court in ''Plumhoff v. Rickard'']]\nThe officers petitioned the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted [[certiorari]] on November 15, 2013, in order to review two questions: (1) \"whether the Sixth Circuit wrongly denied qualified immunity to Petitioners by analyzing whether the force used in 2004 was distinguishable from factually similar force ruled permissible three years later in ''Scott v. Harris''\", and (2) \"whether the Sixth Circuit erred in denying qualified immunity by finding the use of force was not reasonable as a matter of law\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/12-01117qp.pdf|title=12-1117 Plumhoff v.

Writing for a unanimous Court,{{Efn|The Court's decision was unanimous (9\u20130) except that Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] did not join parts III\u2013A and III\u2013B, and Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] did not join part III\u2013B\u20132.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 1.</ref> The Supreme Court's opinion is divided as follows. \n* Part I describes the facts of the case and the lower court proceedings.\n* In Part II, the Court holds that it has jurisdiction to hear this case.\n* In Part III\u2013A, the Court explains why it was beginning its legal analysis with whether a constitutional right was actually violated.\n* In Part III\u2013B\u20131, the Court holds that the police did not violate the Fourth Amendment by using deadly force to end the high-speed car chase.\n* In Part III\u2013B\u20132, the Court rejects the argument that number of shots fired in this case was unreasonable, even if it was reasonable to use deadly force.\n* In Part III\u2013C, the Court holds that even if the officers' conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, they \"would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity\".|name=opinionbreakdown|group=}} Alito began by addressing whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear the case as an [[interlocutory appeal]].{{Efn|An [[interlocutory appeal]] is a type of appeal that occurs in the middle of a trial court's proceeding, while other aspects of the case are still pending. In the case of ''Plumhoff v. Rickard'', the police officers appealed the district court's order denying [[summary judgment]] on qualified immunity. Because the officers appealed the case immediately after this order, without waiting for the case to proceed to trial, the appeal is considered \"interlocutory\".}} In general, federal law (specifically 28 U.S.C. \u00a71291) only allows courts of appeals to hear appeals from the \"final decisions\" of district courts, and Alito acknowledged that an order denying summary judgment \"is generally not a final decision within the meaning of \u00a71291 and is thus generally not immediately appealable\".<ref name=\":0\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 5.</ref> However, summary judgments based on qualified immunity are an exception to this general rule, since qualified immunity is \"an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Alito rejected the respondent's argument that the Court's decision in ''Johnson v. Jones'' prevents Court from having jurisdiction in this case, stating that in ''Johnson'', the summary judgment order was not appealable because \"it merely decided 'a question of evidence sufficiency', ''i.e.'' which facts a party may, or may not, be able to prove at trial\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 6.</ref> In the case of ''Plumhoff v. Jones'', however, the officers raised legal issues, and Alito stated that \"deciding legal issues of this sort is a core responsibility of appellate courts\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nMoving onto the legal questions, Alito first explained why he was beginning his analysis of whether the officers' violated \"clearly established law\" by first answering whether the officers' actually violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures, citing the Court's decision in ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]'' (2001).<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 7.</ref> Examining the facts of the case \"from the perspective 'of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with 20/20 vision of hindsight'\", Alito concluded that the officers had acted reasonably and had not violated the Fourth Amendment.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 8\u201310.</ref> Alito wrote there was \"no basis for reach a different conclusion\" from the Court's decision in ''Scott v. Harris'', stating that \"Rickard's outrageously reckless driving posed a grave public safety risk\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 10.</ref> Furthermore, Alito rejected the respondent's argument that even if the officers were justified in using deadly force, the degree of force that the officers used when firing 15 shots into Rickard's car was unreasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\".<ref name=\":1\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 11.</ref> The presence of a passenger in Rickard's car does not affect this analysis because the question in the case is \"whether petitioners violated Rickard\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, not Allen\u2019s\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Finally, Alito wrote that even if the officers' conduct had violated the Fourth Amendment, they \"would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 12.</ref>\n\n== Analysis and reception ==\n\n=== Implications ===\n\nIn a legal analysis published in ''[[Criminal Justice Review]]'', a peer-reviewed academic journal published by [[SAGE Publishing]], Darrell L. Ross of [[Valdosta State University]] discussed the legal and practical implications of ''Plumhoff''. According to Ross, \"lower courts are reminded of how to assess issues pertaining to qualified immunity, particularly in use of force cases\".<ref name=\":3\">Ross p. 254</ref> Specifically, the \"correct standard, as reiterated by the Court\u2014which was never discussed by the Sixth Circuit\u2014is whether the right was sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood what he or she is doing violates that right.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, Ross wrote that police are also reminded of the Court's principles regarding the use of deadly force in accordance with ''Graham'', especially as it pertains to fleeing motorists. Specifically, Ross wrote, \"Whether force appears reasonable is measured from the perspective of the officer at the moment the officer decided to use it.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Ross also emphasized the implications of the Court's analysis over the number of rounds fired. Ross commented that police officers \"are not trained or required to shoot to wound, nor are they trained to shoot warning shots prior to responding with deadly force.\"<ref name=\":4\">Ross, p. 255</ref> According to Ross, \"Justice Alito confirmed the fact officers are trained to keep shooting until the threat is stopped ...\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Finally, Ross wrote, \"Police administrators are encouraged to review and revise their current use of force and pursuit policies consistent with this decision.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Ross recommended that \"administrators should provide training to their officers on use of force legal issues and principles that emerge from ''Rickard'', ''Graham'', ''Scott'', and ''Brosseau''\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Reactions and criticism ===\n\n[[Erwin Chemerinsky]], the dean of the [[University of California, Irvine School of Law]], wrote an opinion piece published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', in which he described the Court's decision as \"deeply disturbing\", arguing that there are alternatives to shooting at vehicles involves in high-speed car chases and that the Court has \"weakened accountability by ruling that a local government can be held liable only if it is proved that the city\u2019s or county\u2019s own policy violated the Constitution\".<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |last1=Chemerinsky |first1=Erwin |title=Opinion {{!}} How the Supreme Court Protects Bad Cops |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/opinion/how-the-supreme-court-protects-bad-cops.html |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |date=26 August 2014 |page=A23}}</ref> In the article, Chemerinsky also opposed the doctrine of qualified immunity, arguing that it poses an unreasonable burden for individuals alleging violations of constitutional rights.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> In a blog post published in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', Jonathan R. Nash, a professor of law at [[Emory University School of Law]], argued that the Court's decision in ''Plumhoff'' was inconsistent with the precedent it set in ''Scott'', commenting that the Court \"jettisoned ''Scott''<nowiki/>'s careful balancing in favor of an approach designed to give the police substantial leeway in terminating chases\".<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/215291-high-speed-police-pursuits-and-deadly-force|title=High-speed police pursuits and deadly force|last=Nash|first=Jonathan R.|date=August 19, 2014|website=The Hill|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414175726/https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/215291-high-speed-police-pursuits-and-deadly-force|archive-date=April 14, 2018|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> Nash stated there were differences between the facts in ''Plumhoff'' versus the facts in ''Scott'', which he felt should have compelled the Court to a different conclusion. For example, in ''Scott'', the police used a maneuver that caused the driver to spin out of control, whereas in ''Plumhoff'', the police used their firearms.
