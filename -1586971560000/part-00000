Information about his early years is scanty, although some uncorroborated stories have survived, the most famous of which is that he was kidnapped three times because of the singular beauty of his singing voice. At the age of twelve, he left the [[Low Countries]] with [[Ferrante Gonzaga]] and went to [[Mantua]], [[Sicily]], and later [[Milan]] (from 1547 to 1549). While in Milan, he made the acquaintance of the madrigalist [[Spirito l'Hoste da Reggio]], a formative influence on his early musical style.\n\nHe then worked as a singer and a composer for Costantino Castrioto in [[Naples]] in the early 1550s, and his first works are presumed to date from this time. Next he moved to Rome, where he worked for [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], who maintained a household there, and in 1553, he became ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' of the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]], the ecumenical mother church of Rome and a spectacularly prestigious post indeed for a man only twenty-one years old. However, he stayed there for only a year. (Palestrina would assume this post a year later, in 1555.)\n\nNo solid evidence survives for his whereabouts in 1554, but there are contemporary claims that he traveled in France and England. In 1555 he returned to the [[Low Countries]] and had his early works published in [[Antwerp]] (1555\u20131556). In 1556 he joined the court of [[Albert V, Duke of Bavaria|Albrecht V, Duke of Bavaria]], who was consciously attempting to create a musical establishment on a par with the major courts in Italy. Lassus was one of several Netherlanders to work there, and by far the most famous. He evidently was happy in [[Munich]] and decided to settle there. In 1558 he married Regina W\u00e4ckinger, the daughter of a maid of honor of the Duchess. They had two sons, both of whom became composers, and his daughter married the painter [[Hans von Aachen]].<ref>[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0263.php daughter of \"de Lasso\"] in [[Karel van Mander]]'s 1604 dictionary of biographies called [[Schilder-boeck]]</ref> By 1563 Lassus had been appointed ''maestro di cappella'', succeeding [[Ludwig Daser]] in the post. Lassus remained in the service of Albrecht V and his heir, [[William V, Duke of Bavaria|Wilhelm V]], for the rest of his life.\n\nBy the 1560s Lassus had become quite famous, and composers began to go to Munich to study with him. [[Andrea Gabrieli]] went there in 1562, and possibly remained in the chapel for a year. [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] also possibly studied with him in the 1570s. His renown had spread outside strictly musical circles, for in 1570 [[Emperor Maximilian II]] conferred nobility upon him, a rare circumstance for a composer. [[Pope Gregory XIII]] knighted him and in 1571, and again in 1573, the king of France, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], invited him to visit. Some of these kings and aristocrats attempted to woo him away from Munich with more attractive offers, but Lassus was evidently more interested in the stability of his position, and the splendid performance opportunities of Albrecht's court, than in financial gain. \"I do not want to leave my house, my garden, and the other good things in Munich\", he wrote to the Duke of [[Electorate of Saxony]] in 1580, upon receiving an offer for a position in [[Dresden]].\n\nIn the late 1570s and 1580s Lassus made several visits to Italy, where he encountered the most modern styles and trends. In [[Ferrara]], the center of avant-garde activity, he doubtless heard the [[Madrigal (music)|madrigals]] being composed for the d'[[House of Este|Este]] court. However, his own style remained conservative and became simpler and more refined as he aged. In the 1590s his health began to decline, and he went to a doctor named Thomas Mermann for treatment of what was called \"melancholia hypocondriaca\", but he was still able to compose as well as travel occasionally. His final work was often considered one of his best pieces: an exquisite set of twenty-one ''[[madrigali spirituali]]'' known as the ''[[Lagrime di San Pietro]]'' (\"Tears of St. Peter\"), which he dedicated to [[Pope Clement VIII]], and which was published posthumously in 1595. Lassus died in Munich on 14 June 1594, the same day that his employer decided to dismiss him for economic reasons. He never saw the letter. He was buried in Munich in the Alter Franziskaner Friedhof, a cemetery that was cleared of gravestones in 1789 and is now the site of [[Max-Joseph-Platz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=cr&CRid=2223718 |title=Alter Franziskaner Friedhof (Defunct) |publisher=Find a Grave |accessdate=7 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\n== Music and influence ==\nOne of the most prolific, versatile, and universal composers of the late Renaissance, Lassus wrote over 2,000 works in all Latin, French, Italian and German vocal genres known in his time. These include 530 [[motet]]s, 175 Italian [[Madrigal (music)|madrigals]] and [[villanella]]s, 150 French [[chanson]]s, and 90 German [[lied]]er. No strictly instrumental music by Lassus is known to survive, or ever to have existed: an interesting omission for a composer otherwise so wide-ranging and prolific, during an age when instrumental music was becoming an ever-more prominent means of expression, all over Europe. The German music publisher [[Adam Berg (music publisher)|Adam Berg]] dedicated 5 volumes of his ''Patrocinium musicum'' (published from 1573\u20131580) to Lassus' music.\n\n=== Sacred music ===\nLassus remained [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] during this age of religious discord, though this neither hindered him in writing worldly secular songs nor in employing music originally to racy texts in his Magnificats and [[parody masses|masses employing parody technique.]] Nevertheless, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]], which under [[Jesuit]] influence was reaching a peak in Bavaria in the late sixteenth century, had a demonstrable impact on Lassus' late work, including the liturgical music for the Roman Rite, the burgeoning number of Magnificats, the settings of the Catholic Ulenberg Psalter (1588), and especially the great penitential cycle of spiritual madrigals, the [[Lagrime di San Pietro]] (1594).\n\n==== Masses ====\nAlmost 9000 masses have survived complete; most of them are imitation masses (called [[parody masses]]) using as melodic source material secular works written by himself or other composers. Technically impressive, they are nevertheless the most conservative part of his output. He usually conformed the style of the mass to the style of the source material, which ranged from [[Gregorian chant]] to contemporary madrigals, but always maintained an expressive and reverent character in the final product.\n\nSeveral of his masses are based on extremely secular French chansons; some of the source materials were outright obscene.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://radar.brookes.ac.uk/radar/items/6470014f-79d7-4b61-be6f-27bebf8afbbf/1/ |title=The woman at the well: Divine and earthly love in Orlando di Lasso\u2019s parody masses / by Barbara Eichner |publisher=RADAR, Oxford Brookes University |accessdate=31 January 2020 }}</ref> ''Entre vous filles de quinze ans'', \"Oh you fifteen-year old girls\", by [[Jacob Clemens non Papa]], gave him source material for his 1581 ''Missa entre vous filles'', probably the most scandalous of the lot. This practice was not only accepted but encouraged by his employer, which can be confirmed by evidence from their correspondence, much of which has survived.\n\nIn addition to his traditional imitation masses, he wrote a considerable quantity of ''missae breves'', \"brief masses\", syllablic short masses meant for brief services (for example, on days when Duke Albrecht went hunting:  evidently he did not want to be detained by long-winded [[polyphony|polyphonic]] music). The most extreme of these is a work actually known as the ''J\u00e4ger Mass'' (''Missa venatorum'')\u2014the \"Hunter's Mass\".\n\nSome of his masses show influence from the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], particularly in their use of [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] techniques (for example, in the eight-voice ''Missa osculetur me'', based on his own motet). Three of his masses are for double choir, and they may have been influential on the Venetians themselves; after all, [[Andrea Gabrieli]] visited Lassus in Munich in 1562, and many of Lassus's works were published in Venice. Even though Lassus used the contemporary, sonorous Venetian style, his harmonic language remained conservative in these works:  he adapted the texture of the Venetians to his own artistic ends.\n\n==== Motets and other sacred music ====\nLassus is one of the composers of a style known as ''[[musica reservata]]''\u2014a term which has survived in many contemporary references, many of them seemingly contradictory. The exact meaning of the term is a matter of fierce debate, though a rough consensus among musicologists is that it involves intensely expressive setting of text and [[chromaticism]], and that it may have referred to music specifically written for connoisseurs. A famous composition by Lassus representative of this style is his series of 12 motets entitled ''[[Prophetiae Sibyllarum]]'', in a wildly chromatic idiom which anticipates the work of [[Carlo Gesualdo|Gesualdo]]; some of the chord progressions in this piece were not to be heard again until the 20th century.\n\nLassus wrote four settings of the [[Passion (music)|Passion]], one for each of the Evangelists, [[Book of Matthew|St. Matthew]], [[Book of Mark|Mark]], [[Book of Luke|Luke]] and [[Book of John|John]]. All are for ''[[a cappella]]'' voices. He sets the words of [[Christ]] and the narration of the Evangelist as chant, while setting the passages for groups polyphonically.\n\nAs a composer of motets, Lassus was one of the most diverse and prodigious of the entire Renaissance. His output varies from the sublime to the ridiculous, and he showed a sense of humor not often associated with sacred music:  for example, one of his motets satirizes poor singers (his setting of ''Super flumina Babylonis'', for five voices) which includes stuttering, stopping and starting, and general confusion; it is related in concept if not in style to Mozart's ''[[A Musical Joke]]''. Many of his motets were composed for ceremonial occasions, as could be expected of a court composer who was required to provide music for visits of dignitaries, weddings, treaties and other events of state. But it was as a composer of religious motets that Lassus achieved his widest and most lasting fame.\n\nLassus's 1584 setting of the seven [[Penitential Psalms]] of David (''[[Penitential Psalms (Lassus)|Psalmi Davidis poenitentiales]]'') is one of the most famous collections of psalm settings of the entire Renaissance. The counterpoint is free, avoiding the pervasive [[imitation (music)|imitation]] of the Netherlanders such as [[Nicolas Gombert|Gombert]], and occasionally using expressive devices foreign to Palestrina. As elsewhere, Lassus strives for emotional impact, and uses a variety of texture and care in text-setting towards that end. The penultimate piece in the collection, his setting of the ''[[Psalm 130|De profundis]]'' (Psalm 129/130), is considered by many scholars to be one of the high-water marks of Renaissance polyphony, ranking alongside the two settings of the same text by [[Josquin des Prez]].\n\nAmong his other liturgical compositions are [[hymn]]s, [[canticle]]s (including over 100 [[Magnificat]]s), [[responsories for Holy Week]], Passions, [[Lamentations (music)|Lamentations]], and some independent pieces for major feasts.\n\n=== Secular music ===\nLassus wrote in all the prominent secular forms of the time. In the preface to his collection of German songs, Lassus lists his secular works: [[Italian language|Italian]] madrigals and [[French language|French]] chansons, [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] songs. He is probably the only Renaissance composer to write prolifically in five languages&nbsp;\u2013 [[Latin]] in addition to those mentioned above&nbsp;\u2013 and he wrote with equal fluency in each. Many of his songs became hugely popular, circulating widely in Europe. In these various secular songs, he conforms to the manner of the country of origin while still showing his characteristic originality, wit, and terseness of statement.\n\n==== Madrigals ====\n[[File:Orlando de Lassus2.jpg|thumb|right|Lassus leading a chamber ensemble, painted by Hans Mielich]]\n\nIn his [[madrigal]]s, many of which he wrote during his stay in Rome, his style is clear and concise, and he wrote tunes which were easily memorable; he also \"signed\" his work by frequently using the word 'lasso' (and often setting with the sol-fege syllables la-sol, i.e. A-G in the key of C). His choice of poetry varied widely, from [[Petrarch]] for his more serious work to the lightest verse for some of his amusing [[canzonetta]]s.\n\nLassus often preferred cyclic madrigals, i.e. settings of multiple poems in a group as a set of related pieces of music. For example, his fourth book of madrigals for five voices begins with a complete [[sestina]] by Petrarch, continues with two-part [[sonnet]]s, and concludes with another sestina:  therefore the entire book can be heard as a unified composition with each madrigal a subsidiary part.\n\n==== Chansons ====\nAnother form which Lassus cultivated was the French chanson, of which he wrote about 150. Most of them date from the 1550s, but he continued to write them even after he was in Germany:  his last productions in this genre come from the 1580s. They were enormously popular in Europe, and of all his works, they were the most widely arranged for instruments such as lute and keyboard. Most were collected in the 1570s and 1580s in three publications:  one by [[Petrus Phalesius the Elder]] in 1571, and two by Le Roy and Ballard in 1576 and 1584. Stylistically, they ranged from the dignified and serious, to playful, bawdy, and amorous compositions, as well as drinking songs suited to taverns. Lassus followed the polished, lyrical style of [[Claudin de Sermisy|Sermisy]] rather than the programmatic style of [[Cl\u00e9ment Janequin]] for his writing.\n\nOne of the most famous of Lassus's drinking songs was used by [[Shakespeare]] in [[Henry IV, Part II]]. English words are fitted to ''Un jour vis un foulon qui fouloit'' (as ''Monsieur Mingo'') and sung by the drunken Justice Silence, in Act V, Scene iii.\n\n==== German lieder ====\nA third type of secular composition by Lassus was the German [[lied]]. Most of these he evidently intended for a different audience, since they are considerably different in tone and style from either the chansons or madrigals; in addition, he wrote them later in life, with none appearing until 1567, when he was already well-established at Munich. Many are on religious subjects, although light and comic verse is represented as well. He also wrote drinking songs in German, and contrasting with his parallel work in the genre of the chanson, he also wrote songs on the unfortunate aspects of overindulgence.\n<!-- finish up with a summation, comparing to Palestrina and other late 16th c. people -->\n\n==== Dutch songs ====\nIn the preface to his collection of German songs, Lassus states that he had composed Dutch songs. However, no Dutch song has been preserved.<ref>Jan Willem Bonda, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QliYge7-5w0C&lpg=PA144&dq=Orlandus%20Lassus%20Bonda&hl=nl&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q=Lassus&f=false ''De meerstemmige Nederlandse liederen van de vijftiende en zestiende eeuw''], Uitgeverij Verloren, 1996, {{ISBN|90-6550-545-8}}, {{ISBN|978-90-6550-545-3}}, p. 23</ref>\n\n== Media ==\n{{listen|type=music\n | filename     = ResonetInLaudibus.ogg\n | title        = Resonet in laudibus\n | description  =\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n | filename2     = Orlando di Lasso Hodie Completi Sunt \u00e0 6.ogg\n | title2        = Hodie Completi Sunt\n | description2  =\n | format2       = [[Ogg]]}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References and further reading ==\n* Haar, James, \"Orlande de Lassus\", in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', ed.

He sets the words of [[Christ]] and the narration of the Evangelist as chant, while setting the passages for groups polyphonically.\n\nAs a composer of motets, Lassus was one of the most diverse and prodigious of the entire Renaissance. His output varies from the sublime to the ridiculous, and he showed a sense of humor not often associated with sacred music:  for example, one of his motets satirizes poor singers (his setting of ''Super flumina Babylonis'', for five voices) which includes stuttering, stopping and starting, and general confusion; it is related in concept if not in style to Mozart's ''[[A Musical Joke]]''. Many of his motets were composed for ceremonial occasions, as could be expected of a court composer who was required to provide music for visits of dignitaries, weddings, treaties and other events of state. But it was as a composer of religious motets that Lassus achieved his widest and most lasting fame.\n\nLassus's 1584 setting of the seven [[Penitential Psalms]] of David (''[[Penitential Psalms (Lassus)|Psalmi Davidis poenitentiales]]'') is one of the most famous collections of psalm settings of the entire Renaissance. The counterpoint is free, avoiding the pervasive [[imitation (music)|imitation]] of the Netherlanders such as [[Nicolas Gombert|Gombert]], and occasionally using expressive devices foreign to Palestrina. As elsewhere, Lassus strives for emotional impact, and uses a variety of texture and care in text-setting towards that end. The penultimate piece in the collection, his setting of the ''[[Psalm 130|De profundis]]'' (Psalm 129/130), is considered by many scholars to be one of the high-water marks of Renaissance polyphony, ranking alongside the two settings of the same text by [[Josquin des Prez]].\n\nAmong his other liturgical compositions are [[hymn]]s, [[canticle]]s (including over 100 [[Magnificat]]s), [[responsories for Holy Week]], Passions, [[Lamentations (music)|Lamentations]], and some independent pieces for major feasts.\n\n=== Secular music ===\nLassus wrote in all the prominent secular forms of the time. In the preface to his collection of German songs, Lassus lists his secular works: [[Italian language|Italian]] madrigals and [[French language|French]] chansons, [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] songs. He is probably the only Renaissance composer to write prolifically in five languages&nbsp;\u2013 [[Latin]] in addition to those mentioned above&nbsp;\u2013 and he wrote with equal fluency in each. Many of his songs became hugely popular, circulating widely in Europe. In these various secular songs, he conforms to the manner of the country of origin while still showing his characteristic originality, wit, and terseness of statement.\n\n==== Madrigals ====\n[[File:Orlando de Lassus2.jpg|thumb|right|Lassus leading a chamber ensemble, painted by Hans Mielich]]\n\nIn his [[madrigal]]s, many of which he wrote during his stay in Rome, his style is clear and concise, and he wrote tunes which were easily memorable; he also \"signed\" his work by frequently using the word 'lasso' (and often setting with the sol-fege syllables la-sol, i.e. A-G in the key of C). His choice of poetry varied widely, from [[Petrarch]] for his more serious work to the lightest verse for some of his amusing [[canzonetta]]s.\n\nLassus often preferred cyclic madrigals, i.e. settings of multiple poems in a group as a set of related pieces of music. For example, his fourth book of madrigals for five voices begins with a complete [[sestina]] by Petrarch, continues with two-part [[sonnet]]s, and concludes with another sestina:  therefore the entire book can be heard as a unified composition with each madrigal a subsidiary part.\n\n==== Chansons ====\nAnother form which Lassus cultivated was the French chanson, of which he wrote about 150. Most of them date from the 1550s, but he continued to write them even after he was in Germany:  his last productions in this genre come from the 1580s. They were enormously popular in Europe, and of all his works, they were the most widely arranged for instruments such as lute and keyboard. Most were collected in the 1570s and 1580s in three publications:  one by [[Petrus Phalesius the Elder]] in 1571, and two by Le Roy and Ballard in 1576 and 1584. Stylistically, they ranged from the dignified and serious, to playful, bawdy, and amorous compositions, as well as drinking songs suited to taverns. Lassus followed the polished, lyrical style of [[Claudin de Sermisy|Sermisy]] rather than the programmatic style of [[Cl\u00e9ment Janequin]] for his writing.\n\nOne of the most famous of Lassus's drinking songs was used by [[Shakespeare]] in [[Henry IV, Part II]]. English words are fitted to ''Un jour vis un foulon qui fouloit'' (as ''Monsieur Mingo'') and sung by the drunken Justice Silence, in Act V, Scene iii.\n\n==== German lieder ====\nA third type of secular composition by Lassus was the German [[lied]]. Most of these he evidently intended for a different audience, since they are considerably different in tone and style from either the chansons or madrigals; in addition, he wrote them later in life, with none appearing until 1567, when he was already well-established at Munich. Many are on religious subjects, although light and comic verse is represented as well. He also wrote drinking songs in German, and contrasting with his parallel work in the genre of the chanson, he also wrote songs on the unfortunate aspects of overindulgence.\n<!-- finish up with a summation, comparing to Palestrina and other late 16th c. people -->\n\n==== Dutch songs ====\nIn the preface to his collection of German songs, Lassus states that he had composed Dutch songs. However, no Dutch song has been preserved.<ref>Jan Willem Bonda, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QliYge7-5w0C&lpg=PA144&dq=Orlandus%20Lassus%20Bonda&hl=nl&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q=Lassus&f=false ''De meerstemmige Nederlandse liederen van de vijftiende en zestiende eeuw''], Uitgeverij Verloren, 1996, {{ISBN|90-6550-545-8}}, {{ISBN|978-90-6550-545-3}}, p. 23</ref>\n\n== Media ==\n{{listen|type=music\n | filename     = ResonetInLaudibus.ogg\n | title        = Resonet in laudibus\n | description  =\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n | filename2     = Orlando di Lasso Hodie Completi Sunt \u00e0 6.ogg\n | title2        = Hodie Completi Sunt\n | description2  =\n | format2       = [[Ogg]]}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References and further reading ==\n* Haar, James, \"Orlande de Lassus\", in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', ed.

Already Hollywood veterans, the four stars talked of forming their own company to better control their own work.\n\nThey were spurred on by established Hollywood producers and distributors who were tightening their control over actor salaries and creative decisions, a process that evolved into the [[studio system]]. With the addition of Griffith, planning began, but Hart bowed out before anything was formalized. When he heard about their scheme, [[Richard A.

O'Brien (right)<br>stand in the background.]]\n\nUA's first production, ''[[His Majesty, the American]]'', written by and starring Fairbanks, was a success. Funding for movies was limited. Without selling stock to the public like other studios, all United had for finance was weekly prepayment installments from theater owners for upcoming movies. As a result, production was slow, and the company distributed an average of only five films a year in its first five years.<ref name=\"fu\">{{cite web| title=History of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.| url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/metro-goldwyn-mayer-inc-history/| website=Funding Universe| accessdate=December 20, 2014| language=en}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2017}}\n\nBy 1924, Griffith had dropped out, and the company was facing a crisis.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Veteran producer [[Joseph Schenck]] was hired as president.<ref name=\"fu\" /> He had produced pictures for a decade,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and brought commitments for films starring his wife, [[Norma Talmadge]],<ref name=\"fu\" /> his sister-in-law, [[Constance Talmadge]],{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and his brother-in-law, [[Buster Keaton]].<ref name=\"fu\" /> Contracts were signed with independent producers, including [[Samuel Goldwyn]], and [[Howard Hughes]].<ref name=\"fu\" /> In 1933, Schenck organized a new company with [[Darryl&nbsp;F. Zanuck]], called [[Twentieth Century Pictures]], which soon provided four pictures a year, forming half of UA's schedule.<ref name=\"fu\" />\n\nSchenck formed a separate partnership with Pickford and Chaplin to buy and build theaters under the United Artists name. They began international operations, first in Canada, and then in Mexico. By the end of the 1930s, United Artists was represented in over 40 countries.\n\nWhen he was denied an ownership share in 1935, Schenck resigned. He set up [[Twentieth Century Pictures|20th Century Pictures]]' merger with [[Fox Film|Fox Film Corporation]] to form [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/zanuck-schenck.htm|title=The Formation of Twentieth Century-Fox (20th Century Fox)|website=www.cobbles.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref> [[Al Lichtman]] succeeded Schenck as company president. Other independent producers distributed through United Artists in the 1930s including [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]], [[Alexander Korda]], [[Hal Roach]], [[David O. Selznick]], and [[Walter Wanger]].<ref name=\"fu\"/> As the years passed, and the dynamics of the business changed, these \"producing partners\" drifted away. [[Samuel Goldwyn Productions]] and [[Disney]] went to [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] and Wanger to [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nIn the late 1930s, UA turned a profit. Goldwyn was providing most of the output for distribution. He sued United several times for disputed compensation leading him to leave. MGM's 1939 hit ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' was supposed to be a UA release except that Selznick wanted [[Clark Gable]], who was under contract to MGM, to play [[Rhett Butler]]. Also that year, Fairbanks died.<ref name=\"fu\"/>\n\nUA became embroiled in lawsuits with Selznick over his distribution of some films through [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]. Selznick considered UA's operation sloppy, and left to start his own distribution arm.<ref name=\"fu\" />\n\nIn the 1940s, United Artists was losing money because of poorly received pictures.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Cinema attendance continued to decline as television became more popular.<ref name=\"fu\"/>  The company sold its Mexican releasing division to Cr\u00e9dito Cinematogr\u00e1fico Mexicano, a local company.\n\n===Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (1940s and 1950s)===\nIn 1941, Pickford, Chaplin, Disney, [[Orson Welles]], Goldwyn, Selznick, Alexander Korda, and Wanger\u2014many of whom were members of United Artists\u2014formed the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (SIMPP). Later members included [[Hunt Stromberg]], [[William Cagney]], [[Sol Lesser]], and [[Hal Roach]].\n\nThe Society aimed to advance the interests of independent producers in an industry controlled by the studio system. SIMPP fought to end ostensibly anti-competitive practices by the seven major film studios\u2014Loew's (MGM), [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], RKO Radio Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros./First National]]\u2014that controlled the production, distribution, and exhibition of motion pictures.\n\nIn 1942, SIMPP filed an antitrust suit against Paramount's [[United Paramount Theaters|United Detroit Theatres]]. The complaint accused Paramount of conspiracy to control first-and subsequent-run theaters in Detroit. This was the first antitrust suit brought by producers against exhibitors that alleged monopoly and restraint of trade. In 1948, the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Paramount Decision]] ordered the major Hollywood [[movie studio]]s to sell their theater chains and to end certain anti-competitive practices. This court ruling ended the studio system.\n\nBy 1958, SIMPP achieved many of the goals that led to its creation, and the group ceased operations.\n\n===Krim and Benjamin===\nNeeding a turnaround, Pickford and Chaplin hired [[Paul V. McNutt]] in 1950,<ref name=UA40/> a former governor of Indiana, as chairman and Frank L. McNamee as president. McNutt did not have the skill to solve UA's financial problems and the pair was replaced after only a few months.<ref name=\"fu\"/>\n\nOn February 15, 1951, lawyers-turned-producers [[Arthur B. Krim]] (of [[Eagle-Lion Films]]), [[Robert Benjamin]] and Matty Fox<ref name=UA40/> approached Pickford and Chaplin with a wild idea: let them take over United Artists for ten years.

Primarily acting as bankers, they offered money to independent producers. UA leased space at the Pickford/Fairbanks Studio but did not own a studio lot. Thus UA did not have the overhead, the maintenance, or the expensive production staff at other studios.\n\nAmong their first clients were [[Sam Spiegel]] and [[John Huston]], whose Horizon Productions gave UA one major hit, ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951) and a substantial success, ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]'' (1952). As well as ''The African Queen'' UA also had success with ''[[High Noon]]'' in their first year, earning a profit of $313,000 compared to a loss of $871,000 the previous year.<ref name=UA40/><ref name=\"fu\"/>  Others clients followed, among them [[Stanley Kramer]], [[Otto Preminger]], [[Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions]], and actors newly freed from studio contracts and seeking to produce or direct their own films.\n\nWith the instability in the film industry due to theater divestment, the business was considered risky. In 1955, movie attendance reached its lowest level since 1923. Chaplin sold his 25 percent share during this crisis to Krim and Benjamin for $1.1&nbsp;million, followed a year later by Pickford who sold her share for $3&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"fu\"/>\n\nIn the late 1950s, United Artists produced two modest films that became financial and critical successes for the company. The company made ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' which won 1955's Palme d'Or and best picture Oscar.

But his attempt failed and instead he merged MGM/UA with his former company, resulting in [[MGM-Path\u00e9 Communications]] Co. During the transaction, Parretti overstated his own financial condition and within a year defaulted to his primary lender, [[Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais]], which foreclosed on the studio in 1992.<ref name=PBart>{{cite news| title=MGM: Sometimes a Roaring Silence Is Best| url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/news/mgm-sometimes-a-roaring-silence-is-best-1200341378/| last=Bart| first=Peter| date=April 10, 2013| newspaper=Variety| accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Fleming\"/> This resulted in the sale or closure of MGM/UA's string of US theaters.

Under his supervision, Calley revived the Pink Panther and James Bond franchises and highlighted UA's past by giving the widest release ever to a film with an NC-17 rating, ''[[Showgirls]]''. Credit Lyonnais sold MGM in 1996, again to Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda, leading to Calley's departure.<ref name=\"Fleming\"/>\n\nIn 1999, filmmaker [[Francis Ford Coppola]] attempted to buy UA from Kerkorian who rejected the offer.

However, throughout the studio's history, UA acted more as a distributor than a film studio, crediting the copyright to the production company responsible.

In 1982, 20th Century-Fox Video merged with [[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS Video Enterprises]] (which earlier split from [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/CBS Home Video]] after MGM merged with UA) giving birth to [[CBS/Fox Video]].

However, the newly renamed [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]] started releasing some UA product, including UA films originally released in the mid-80s.

[[Mary Pickford]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] had their contracts, with First National and [[Famous Players-Lasky]] respectively, running out soon with no offers forthcoming. Sydney Chaplin, brother and business manager for Charlie, check with Pickford and Fairbanks and deduced something was up. The trio hired a private detective to find out. The detective turned up a plan to merge all production companies and lock in exhibition companies with five year contracts.<ref name=uacbs/>\n\nPickford, Chaplin, [[Douglas Fairbanks|Fairbanks]], and [[D. W. Griffith|Griffith]] incorporated United Artist as a joint venture on February 5, 1919. Each held a 25 percent stake in the [[Preferred stock|preferred shares]] and a 20 percent stake in the [[Common stock|common shares]] of the joint venture, with the remaining 20 percent of common shares held by lawyer and advisor [[William Gibbs McAdoo]].<ref name=\"siklos\">{{cite news|last1=Siklos|first1=Richard|title=Mission Improbable: Tom Cruise as Mogul|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/business/yourmoney/04cruise.html|accessdate=2 October 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=4 March 2007}}</ref> The idea for the venture originated with Fairbanks, Chaplin, Pickford and cowboy star [[William&nbsp;S. Hart]] a year earlier. Already Hollywood veterans, the four stars talked of forming their own company to better control their own work.\n\nThey were spurred on by established Hollywood producers and distributors who were tightening their control over actor salaries and creative decisions, a process that evolved into the [[studio system]]. With the addition of Griffith, planning began, but Hart bowed out before anything was formalized. When he heard about their scheme, [[Richard A. Rowland]], head of [[Metro Pictures]], apparently said, \"The inmates are taking over the asylum.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@devonjames/the-inmates-are-taking-over-the-asylum-3b6ffd8a66c4|title=\"The inmates are taking over the asylum.\"|last=james|first=devon|date=2016-06-02|website=devon james|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref> The four partners, with advice from McAdoo (son-in-law and former [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] of then-President [[Woodrow Wilson]]), formed their distribution company.

By the time the company was operational in 1921, feature films were becoming more expensive and polished, and running times had settled at around ninety minutes (eight reels). The original goal was thus abandoned.\n\n[[File:United Artists contract signature 1919.jpg|thumb|[[D. W.

O'Brien (right)<br>stand in the background.]]\n\nUA's first production, ''[[His Majesty, the American]]'', written by and starring Fairbanks, was a success. Funding for movies was limited. Without selling stock to the public like other studios, all United had for finance was weekly prepayment installments from theater owners for upcoming movies. As a result, production was slow, and the company distributed an average of only five films a year in its first five years.<ref name=\"fu\">{{cite web| title=History of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.| url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/metro-goldwyn-mayer-inc-history/| website=Funding Universe| accessdate=December 20, 2014| language=en}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2017}}\n\nBy 1924, Griffith had dropped out, and the company was facing a crisis.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Veteran producer [[Joseph Schenck]] was hired as president.<ref name=\"fu\" /> He had produced pictures for a decade,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and brought commitments for films starring his wife, [[Norma Talmadge]],<ref name=\"fu\" /> his sister-in-law, [[Constance Talmadge]],{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and his brother-in-law, [[Buster Keaton]].<ref name=\"fu\" /> Contracts were signed with independent producers, including [[Samuel Goldwyn]], and [[Howard Hughes]].<ref name=\"fu\" /> In 1933, Schenck organized a new company with [[Darryl&nbsp;F. Zanuck]], called [[Twentieth Century Pictures]], which soon provided four pictures a year, forming half of UA's schedule.<ref name=\"fu\" />\n\nSchenck formed a separate partnership with Pickford and Chaplin to buy and build theaters under the United Artists name. They began international operations, first in Canada, and then in Mexico. By the end of the 1930s, United Artists was represented in over 40 countries.\n\nWhen he was denied an ownership share in 1935, Schenck resigned. He set up [[Twentieth Century Pictures|20th Century Pictures]]' merger with [[Fox Film|Fox Film Corporation]] to form [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/zanuck-schenck.htm|title=The Formation of Twentieth Century-Fox (20th Century Fox)|website=www.cobbles.com|access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref> [[Al Lichtman]] succeeded Schenck as company president. Other independent producers distributed through United Artists in the 1930s including [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]], [[Alexander Korda]], [[Hal Roach]], [[David O. Selznick]], and [[Walter Wanger]].<ref name=\"fu\"/> As the years passed, and the dynamics of the business changed, these \"producing partners\" drifted away. [[Samuel Goldwyn Productions]] and [[Disney]] went to [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] and Wanger to [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nIn the late 1930s, UA turned a profit. Goldwyn was providing most of the output for distribution. He sued United several times for disputed compensation leading him to leave. MGM's 1939 hit ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' was supposed to be a UA release except that Selznick wanted [[Clark Gable]], who was under contract to MGM, to play [[Rhett Butler]]. Also that year, Fairbanks died.<ref name=\"fu\"/>\n\nUA became embroiled in lawsuits with Selznick over his distribution of some films through [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]. Selznick considered UA's operation sloppy, and left to start his own distribution arm.<ref name=\"fu\" />\n\nIn the 1940s, United Artists was losing money because of poorly received pictures.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Cinema attendance continued to decline as television became more popular.<ref name=\"fu\"/>  The company sold its Mexican releasing division to Cr\u00e9dito Cinematogr\u00e1fico Mexicano, a local company.\n\n===Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (1940s and 1950s)===\nIn 1941, Pickford, Chaplin, Disney, [[Orson Welles]], Goldwyn, Selznick, Alexander Korda, and Wanger\u2014many of whom were members of United Artists\u2014formed the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers (SIMPP). Later members included [[Hunt Stromberg]], [[William Cagney]], [[Sol Lesser]], and [[Hal Roach]].\n\nThe Society aimed to advance the interests of independent producers in an industry controlled by the studio system. SIMPP fought to end ostensibly anti-competitive practices by the seven major film studios\u2014Loew's (MGM), [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], RKO Radio Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros./First National]]\u2014that controlled the production, distribution, and exhibition of motion pictures.\n\nIn 1942, SIMPP filed an antitrust suit against Paramount's [[United Paramount Theaters|United Detroit Theatres]]. The complaint accused Paramount of conspiracy to control first-and subsequent-run theaters in Detroit. This was the first antitrust suit brought by producers against exhibitors that alleged monopoly and restraint of trade. In 1948, the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Paramount Decision]] ordered the major Hollywood [[movie studio]]s to sell their theater chains and to end certain anti-competitive practices. This court ruling ended the studio system.\n\nBy 1958, SIMPP achieved many of the goals that led to its creation, and the group ceased operations.\n\n===Krim and Benjamin===\nNeeding a turnaround, Pickford and Chaplin hired [[Paul V. McNutt]] in 1950,<ref name=UA40/> a former governor of Indiana, as chairman and Frank L. McNamee as president.

Primarily acting as bankers, they offered money to independent producers. UA leased space at the Pickford/Fairbanks Studio but did not own a studio lot. Thus UA did not have the overhead, the maintenance, or the expensive production staff at other studios.\n\nAmong their first clients were [[Sam Spiegel]] and [[John Huston]], whose Horizon Productions gave UA one major hit, ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951) and a substantial success, ''[[Moulin Rouge (1952 film)|Moulin Rouge]]'' (1952).

In 1955, movie attendance reached its lowest level since 1923. Chaplin sold his 25 percent share during this crisis to Krim and Benjamin for $1.1&nbsp;million, followed a year later by Pickford who sold her share for $3&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"fu\"/>\n\nIn the late 1950s, United Artists produced two modest films that became financial and critical successes for the company. The company made ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' which won 1955's Palme d'Or and best picture Oscar.

Other successful projects backed in this period included the ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|Pink Panther]]'' series, which began in 1964, and [[Spaghetti Western]]s, which made a star of [[Clint Eastwood]] in the films of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' and ''[[The Good, The Bad and The Ugly]]''.\n\nIn 1964, the French subsidiary, Les Productions Artistes Associ\u00e9s, released its first production ''[[That Man from Rio]]''.\n\nIn 1965, UA released the anticipated George Stevens' production of ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' and was at the time, the most expensive film which was budgeted at $20 million. Max Von Sydow in the role of Jesus Christ, lead an all-star cast which includes Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowell, Martin Landau, Dorothy McGuire, Sal Mineo, Ina Balin, Joanna Dunham, David McCallum, Nehemiah Persoff, Donald Pleasence, Jos\u00e9 Ferrer and Ed Wynn. Some had cameos for only a brief moment in the picture: Angela Lansbury, Sidney Poitier, Shelley Winters, Pat Boone and John Wayne as the Centurion who supervises Christ\u2019s crucifixion. While the film was released in Ultra Panavision 70 and included several breathtaking scenes of cinematography, the film didn\u2019t make back its budget and was released to mixed critical receptions, but it has since been acclaimed as a classic by audiences around the world for being admirably inspired in its attempt to be faithful to the four books of the New Testament in the Holy Bible plus the book of the same name by Fulton Oursler and the radio program. \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" received five Academy Award\u00ae nominations in 1965 and received an accolade\nas one of the \u201cTop 10 Films of the Year\u201d from The National Board of Review.\n\n===Transamerica subsidiary===\n[[File:United Artists logo 1975.svg|thumb|The second United Artists logo, used during the company's sale to Transamerica from 1967 until 1982.]]\nOn the basis of its film and television hits, in 1967, [[Transamerica Corporation]] purchased 98 percent of UA's stock. Transamerica selected David and Arnold Picker to lead its studio.<ref name=\"fu\"/> UA debuted a new logo incorporating the parent company's striped T emblem and the tagline \"Entertainment from Transamerica Corporation\". This wording was later shortened to \"A Transamerica Company\". The following year, in 1968, United Artists Associated was reincorporated as United Artists Television Distribution.\n\nUA released another Best Picture Oscar winner in 1967, ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' and a nominee for Best Picture, ''[[The Graduate]]'', an [[Embassy Pictures|Embassy]] production that UA distributed overseas.\n\nIn 1970, UA lost $35&nbsp;million; thus the Pickers were pushed aside for the return of Krim and Benjamin.<ref name=\"fu\"/>\n\nOther successful pictures included the [[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|1971 screen version]] of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''. However, [[Man of La Mancha (film)|the 1972 film version of ''Man of La Mancha'']] was a failure. New talent was encouraged, including [[Woody Allen]], [[Robert Altman]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Saul Zaentz]], [[Milo\u0161 Forman]], and [[Brian De Palma]].\n\nIn 1973, United Artists took over the sales and distribution of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s films in [[Anglo-America]]. [[Cinema International Corporation]] assumed international distribution rights for MGM's films and carried on to United International Pictures (made from CIC and UA's International assets being owned by partner MGM) in the 1980s.

In his youth, Philip was held as a [[Hostage#Historical practices|hostage]] in Illyria under Bardylis<ref>Howe, T.

The deaths of Philip's elder brothers, [[Alexander II of Macedon|King Alexander II]] and [[Perdiccas III of Macedon|Perdiccas III]], allowed him to take the throne in 359 BC. Originally appointed [[regent]] for his infant nephew [[Amyntas IV of Macedon|Amyntas IV]], who was the son of Perdiccas III, Philip succeeded in taking the kingdom for himself that same year.\n\nPhilip's military skills and expansionist vision of Macedonian greatness brought him early success. He first had to remedy a predicament which had been greatly worsened by the defeat against the [[Illyrians]] in which King Perdiccas himself had died. The [[Paionia]]ns and the [[Thracians]] had sacked and invaded the eastern regions of Macedonia, while the [[Athens|Athenians]] had landed, at [[Methoni, Pieria|Methoni]] on the coast, a contingent under a Macedonian pretender called [[Argeus (pretender)|Argeus]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Early military career===\n{{see also|Ancient Macedonian army|Government of Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\nUsing diplomacy, Philip pushed back the Paionians and Thracians promising tributes, and crushed the 3,000 Athenian [[hoplite]]s (359). Momentarily free from his opponents, he concentrated on strengthening his internal position and, above all, his army. His most important innovation was doubtless the introduction of the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] infantry corps, armed with the famous [[sarissa]], an exceedingly long spear, at the time the most important army corps in Macedonia.\n\nPhilip had married [[Audata]], great-granddaughter of the Illyrian king of [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]], [[Bardyllis]]. However, this did not prevent him from marching against the Illyrians in 358 and crushing them in a ferocious battle in which some 7,000 Illyrians died (357). By this move, Philip established his authority inland as far as [[Lake Ohrid]] and earned the favour of the [[Epirotes]].<ref>The Cambridge Ancient History Volume 6: The Fourth Century BC by D. M. Lewis, 1994, p. 374, {{ISBN|0-521-23348-8}}: \"...&nbsp;The victory over Bardylis made him an attractive ally to the Epirotes, who too had suffered at the Illyrians' hands, and his recent alignment ...\"</ref>\n[[File:The wounding of Philip.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The wounding of Philip.]]\nThe Athenians had been unable to conquer [[Amphipolis]], which commanded the [[Gold mining|gold mines]] of [[Mount Pangaion]].  So Philip reached an agreement with Athens to lease the city to them after its conquest, in exchange for [[Ancient Pydna|Pydna]] (lost by Macedon in 363). However, after conquering Amphipolis, Philip kept both cities (357). As Athens had declared war against him, he allied Macedon with the [[Chalkidian League]] of [[Olynthus]]. He subsequently conquered [[Potidaea]], this time keeping his word and ceding it to the League in 356.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 357 BC, Philip married the [[Epirus|Epirote]] princess [[Olympias]], who was the daughter of the king of the [[Molossians]].  [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] was born in 356, the same year as Philip's racehorse won at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]].\n\nDuring 356 BC, Philip conquered the town of [[Krinides|Crenides]] and changed its name to [[Philippi]]. He then established a powerful garrison there to control its mines, which yielded much of the gold he later used for his campaigns. In the meantime, his general [[Parmenion]] defeated the Illyrians again.\n\nIn 355\u2013354 he besieged [[Methoni, Pieria|Methone]], the last city on the [[Thermaic Gulf]] controlled by Athens. During the siege, Philip was injured in his right eye, which was later removed surgically.<ref>A special instrument known as the [[Spoon of Dioclese]] was used to remove his eye.</ref> Despite the arrival of two Athenian fleets, the city fell in 354. Philip also attacked [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] and Maronea, on the [[Thrace|Thracian]] coast (354\u2013353).<ref name=\"Bevan1911\">{{EB1911|wstitle = Philip II., king of Macedonia|volume=21|first=Edwyn Robert |last=Bevan|page=377|inline=yes}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Map Macedonia 336 BC-en.svg|thumb|450px|Map of the territory of Philip II of Macedon]]\n\n===Third Sacred War===\nPhilip was involved in the [[Third Sacred War]] which had begun in Greece in 356. In summer 353 he invaded [[Thessaly]], defeating 7,000 [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocians]] under the brother of [[Onomarchus]]. The latter however defeated Philip in the two succeeding battles. Philip returned to Thessaly the next summer, this time with an army of 20,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry including all{{clarify|date=July 2016}} Thessalian troops. In the [[Battle of Crocus Field]] 6,000 Phocians fell, while 3,000 were taken as prisoners and later drowned.\n\nThis battle earned Philip immense prestige, as well as the free acquisition of [[Pherae]]. Philip was also ''tagus'' of Thessaly, and he claimed as his own [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]], with the important harbour of [[Pagasae]].<ref name=\"Bevan1911\" /> Philip did not attempt to advance into [[Central Greece]] because the Athenians, unable to arrive in time to defend Pagasae, had occupied [[Thermopylae]].\n\nThere were no hostilities with Athens yet, but Athens was threatened by the Macedonian party which Philip's gold created{{clarify|date=July 2016}} in [[Euboea]]. From 352 to 346 BC, Philip did not again travel south. He was active in completing the subjugation of the [[Balkans|Balkan]] hill-country to the west and north, and in reducing the Greek cities of the coast as far as the [[Maritsa|Hebrus]]. To the chief of these coastal cities, [[Olynthus]], Philip continued to profess friendship until its neighbouring cities were in his hands.<ref name=\"Bevan1911\" />\n\n[[File:PhilipIIGoldStaterHeadOfApollo.jpg|thumb|250px|Philip II gold [[stater]], with head of [[Apollo]]]]\n[[File:Macedon Philip II AR Tetradrachm Thunderbolt Control Mark, LeRider 234 Plate Coin, 1965 Thessalonica Hoard.xcf|thumb|249x249px|Silver tetradrachms dated back to the reign of Philip II.

Olynthus had at first allied itself with Philip, but later shifted its allegiance to Athens. The latter, however, did nothing to help the city, its expeditions held back by a revolt in Euboea (probably paid for by Philip's gold). The Macedonian king finally took Olynthus in 348 BC and razed the city to the ground. The same fate was inflicted on other cities of the Chalcidian peninsula.\n\nMacedon and the regions adjoining it having now been securely consolidated, Philip celebrated his [[Olympic Games]] at [[Dion, Greece|Dium]]. In 347 BC, Philip advanced to the conquest of the eastern districts about Hebrus, and compelled the submission of the [[Odrysian kingdom|Thracian]] prince [[Cersobleptes]]. In 346 BC, he intervened effectively in the war between Thebes and the Phocians, but his wars with Athens continued intermittently. However, Athens had made overtures for peace, and when Philip again moved south, peace was sworn in Thessaly.<ref name=\"Bevan1911\" />\n\n===Later campaigns (346\u2013336 BC)===\nWith key Greek city-states in submission, Philip II turned to [[Sparta]]; he sent them a message: \"If I win this war, you will be slaves forever.\" In another version, he warned: \"You are advised to submit without further delay, for if I bring my army into your land, I will destroy your farms, slay your people, and raze your city.\" According to both accounts, the Spartans' [[laconic]] reply was one word: \"If.\" Philip II and Alexander both chose to leave Sparta alone. Later, Macedonian arms were carried across Epirus to the [[Adriatic Sea]].<ref name=\"Bevan1911\" />\n\nIn 345 BC, Philip conducted a hard-fought campaign against the Ardiaioi ([[Ardiaei]]), under their king [[Pleuratus I]], during which Philip was seriously wounded in the lower right leg by an Ardian soldier.<ref>Ashley, James R., The Macedonian Empire: The Era of Warfare Under Philip II and Alexander the Great, 359\u2013323 BCE., McFarland, 2004, p. 114, {{ISBN|0-7864-1918-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 342 BC, Philip led a great military expedition north against the [[Scythians]], conquering the Thracian fortified settlement Eumolpia to give it his name, ''Philippopolis'' (modern [[Plovdiv]]).\n\nIn 340 BC, Philip started the siege of [[Marmara Ere\u011fli|Perinthus]]. Philip began another siege in 339 of the city of [[Byzantium]]. After unsuccessful sieges of both cities, Philip's influence all over Greece was compromised.<ref name=\"Bevan1911\" /> However, he successfully reasserted his authority in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] by defeating an alliance of Thebans and Athenians at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] in 338 BC, while in the same year, Philip destroyed [[Amfissa]] because the residents had illegally cultivated part of the Crisaian plain which belonged to [[Delphi]].\n\nIn 336 BC, Philip and Alexander the Great were honored with numerous decrees passed by the Assembly Presidents proposed by Athenian Philippides of Paiania for their triumph at Chaeronea. Philippides also succored Philip's campaign in Eleuthera, Tenegra and Thebes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Edward |title=Dinarchus, Hyperides,& Lycurgus |date=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0-292-79143-7 |pages=80\u201382}}</ref>\n\nIt was these decisive victories that finally secured Philip's position, with the majority of Greece under Macedonian sovereignty.\n\nPhilip created and led the [[League of Corinth]] in 337 BC. Members of the League agreed never to wage war against each other, unless it was to suppress [[revolution]]. Philip was elected as leader (''[[Hegemony|hegemon]]'') of the army of invasion against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].\n\n===Asian campaign (336 BC)===\nPhilip II was involved quite early against the Achaemenid Empire.

The court had gathered there for the celebration of the marriage between [[Alexander I of Epirus]] and [[Cleopatra of Macedon]], who was Philip's daughter by his fourth wife [[Olympias]]. While the king was entering unprotected into the town's theatre (highlighting his approachability to the Greek diplomats present), he was killed by [[Pausanias of Orestis]], one of his seven bodyguards. The assassin immediately tried to escape and reach his associates who were waiting for him with horses at the entrance to Aegae. He was pursued by three of Philip's bodyguards, tripped on a vine, and died by their hands.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe reasons for the assassination are difficult to expound fully: There was already controversy among ancient historians, and the only contemporary account in our possession is that of [[Aristotle]], who states rather tersely that Philip was killed because Pausanias had been offended by the followers of [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]], uncle of Philip's wife [[Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon|Cleopatra]] (renamed Eurydice upon marriage).\n\n===Cleitarchus' analysis===\nFifty years later, the historian [[Cleitarchus]] expanded and embellished the story. Centuries later, this version was to be narrated by [[Diodorus Siculus]] and all the historians who used Cleitarchus. According to the sixteenth book of Diodorus' history,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holoka.com/diodorus%20on%20philip.htm |author=Diodorus Siculus |title=The Library of History |id=16.91-95 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304065912/http://www.holoka.com/diodorus%20on%20philip.htm |archive-date=2010-03-04 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Pausanias of Orestis had been a lover of Philip, but became jealous when Philip turned his attention to a younger man, also called Pausanias. The elder Pausanias' taunting of the new lover caused the younger Pausanias to throw away his life in battle, which turned his friend Attalus against the elder Pausanias. Attalus took his revenge by getting Pausanias of Orestis drunk at a public dinner and then raping him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nWhen Pausanias complained to Philip, the king felt unable to chastise Attalus, as he was about to send him to Asia with [[Parmenion]], to establish a bridgehead for his planned invasion. Philip also was recently married to Attalus' niece, [[Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon|Cleopatra Eurydice]]. Rather than offend Attalus, Philip tried to mollify Pausanias by elevating him within his personal bodyguard. Pausanias' desire for revenge seems to have turned towards the man who had failed to avenge his damaged honour, so he planned to kill Philip. Some time after the alleged rape, while Attalus was away in Asia fighting the Persians, he put his plan in action.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Justin's analysis===\nOther historians (e.g., [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] 9.7) suggested that Alexander and/or his mother [[Olympias]] were at least privy to the intrigue, if not themselves instigators. The latter seems to have been anything but discreet in manifesting her gratitude to Pausanias, according to Justin's report: He writes that the same night of her return from exile, she placed a crown on the assassin's corpse, and later erected a [[tumulus]] over his grave and ordering annual sacrifices to the memory of Pausanias.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Modern analysis===\n[[File:Assassination of Philip of Macedon.jpg|thumb|Assassination of Philip of Macedon. 19th century illustration.]]\nMany modern historians have observed that '''''all''''' the accounts are improbable: In the case of Pausanias, the stated motive of the crime hardly seems adequate. On the other hand, the implication of Alexander and Olympias seems specious \u2013 to act as they did would have required brazen effrontery in the face of a military personally loyal to Philip. What seems to be recorded are the natural suspicions that fell on the chief beneficiaries of the assassination, however their actions in response to the murder cannot prove their guilt in the crime itself \u2013 regardless of how sympathetic they might have seemed afterward.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nWhatever the actual background to the assassination, it may have had an enormous effect on later world history, far beyond what any conspirators could have predicted. As asserted by some modern historians, had the older and more settled Philip been the one in charge of the war against Persia, he might have rested content with relatively moderate conquests, e.g., making [[Anatolia]] into a Macedonian province, and not pushed further into an overall conquest of Persia and further campaigns in India.<ref>{{cite book |author-first=Laurence T. |author-last=Stevens |contribution=The Assassin who Launched the Hellenistic Age |editor-first=Jane |editor-last=Trent |title=Is History Made by Accident?}}</ref>\n\n==Marriages==\n[[File:Philip II statue 350-400 CE.jpg|thumb|Statue of Philip II, 350-400 CE.

The deaths of Philip's elder brothers, [[Alexander II of Macedon|King Alexander II]] and [[Perdiccas III of Macedon|Perdiccas III]], allowed him to take the throne in 359 BC. Originally appointed [[regent]] for his infant nephew [[Amyntas IV of Macedon|Amyntas IV]], who was the son of Perdiccas III, Philip succeeded in taking the kingdom for himself that same year.\n\nPhilip's military skills and expansionist vision of Macedonian greatness brought him early success. He first had to remedy a predicament which had been greatly worsened by the defeat against the [[Illyrians]] in which King Perdiccas himself had died. The [[Paionia]]ns and the [[Thracians]] had sacked and invaded the eastern regions of Macedonia, while the [[Athens|Athenians]] had landed, at [[Methoni, Pieria|Methoni]] on the coast, a contingent under a Macedonian pretender called [[Argeus (pretender)|Argeus]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Early military career===\n{{see also|Ancient Macedonian army|Government of Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\nUsing diplomacy, Philip pushed back the Paionians and Thracians promising tributes, and crushed the 3,000 Athenian [[hoplite]]s (359). Momentarily free from his opponents, he concentrated on strengthening his internal position and, above all, his army. His most important innovation was doubtless the introduction of the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] infantry corps, armed with the famous [[sarissa]], an exceedingly long spear, at the time the most important army corps in Macedonia.\n\nPhilip had married [[Audata]], great-granddaughter of the Illyrian king of [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]], [[Bardyllis]]. However, this did not prevent him from marching against the Illyrians in 358 and crushing them in a ferocious battle in which some 7,000 Illyrians died (357). By this move, Philip established his authority inland as far as [[Lake Ohrid]] and earned the favour of the [[Epirotes]].<ref>The Cambridge Ancient History Volume 6: The Fourth Century BC by D. M. Lewis, 1994, p. 374, {{ISBN|0-521-23348-8}}: \"...&nbsp;The victory over Bardylis made him an attractive ally to the Epirotes, who too had suffered at the Illyrians' hands, and his recent alignment ...\"</ref>\n[[File:The wounding of Philip.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The wounding of Philip.]]\nThe Athenians had been unable to conquer [[Amphipolis]], which commanded the [[Gold mining|gold mines]] of [[Mount Pangaion]].  So Philip reached an agreement with Athens to lease the city to them after its conquest, in exchange for [[Ancient Pydna|Pydna]] (lost by Macedon in 363). However, after conquering Amphipolis, Philip kept both cities (357). As Athens had declared war against him, he allied Macedon with the [[Chalkidian League]] of [[Olynthus]]. He subsequently conquered [[Potidaea]], this time keeping his word and ceding it to the League in 356.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 357 BC, Philip married the [[Epirus|Epirote]] princess [[Olympias]], who was the daughter of the king of the [[Molossians]].  [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] was born in 356, the same year as Philip's racehorse won at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]].\n\nDuring 356 BC, Philip conquered the town of [[Krinides|Crenides]] and changed its name to [[Philippi]]. He then established a powerful garrison there to control its mines, which yielded much of the gold he later used for his campaigns. In the meantime, his general [[Parmenion]] defeated the Illyrians again.\n\nIn 355\u2013354 he besieged [[Methoni, Pieria|Methone]], the last city on the [[Thermaic Gulf]] controlled by Athens. During the siege, Philip was injured in his right eye, which was later removed surgically.<ref>A special instrument known as the [[Spoon of Dioclese]] was used to remove his eye.</ref> Despite the arrival of two Athenian fleets, the city fell in 354. Philip also attacked [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] and Maronea, on the [[Thrace|Thracian]] coast (354\u2013353).<ref name=\"Bevan1911\">{{EB1911|wstitle = Philip II., king of Macedonia|volume=21|first=Edwyn Robert |last=Bevan|page=377|inline=yes}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Map Macedonia 336 BC-en.svg|thumb|450px|Map of the territory of Philip II of Macedon]]\n\n===Third Sacred War===\nPhilip was involved in the [[Third Sacred War]] which had begun in Greece in 356. In summer 353 he invaded [[Thessaly]], defeating 7,000 [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocians]] under the brother of [[Onomarchus]]. The latter however defeated Philip in the two succeeding battles. Philip returned to Thessaly the next summer, this time with an army of 20,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry including all{{clarify|date=July 2016}} Thessalian troops. In the [[Battle of Crocus Field]] 6,000 Phocians fell, while 3,000 were taken as prisoners and later drowned.\n\nThis battle earned Philip immense prestige, as well as the free acquisition of [[Pherae]]. Philip was also ''tagus'' of Thessaly, and he claimed as his own [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]], with the important harbour of [[Pagasae]].<ref name=\"Bevan1911\" /> Philip did not attempt to advance into [[Central Greece]] because the Athenians, unable to arrive in time to defend Pagasae, had occupied [[Thermopylae]].\n\nThere were no hostilities with Athens yet, but Athens was threatened by the Macedonian party which Philip's gold created{{clarify|date=July 2016}} in [[Euboea]]. From 352 to 346 BC, Philip did not again travel south. He was active in completing the subjugation of the [[Balkans|Balkan]] hill-country to the west and north, and in reducing the Greek cities of the coast as far as the [[Maritsa|Hebrus]]. To the chief of these coastal cities, [[Olynthus]], Philip continued to profess friendship until its neighbouring cities were in his hands.<ref name=\"Bevan1911\" />\n\n[[File:PhilipIIGoldStaterHeadOfApollo.jpg|thumb|250px|Philip II gold [[stater]], with head of [[Apollo]]]]\n[[File:Macedon Philip II AR Tetradrachm Thunderbolt Control Mark, LeRider 234 Plate Coin, 1965 Thessalonica Hoard.xcf|thumb|249x249px|Silver tetradrachms dated back to the reign of Philip II.

Olynthus had at first allied itself with Philip, but later shifted its allegiance to Athens. The latter, however, did nothing to help the city, its expeditions held back by a revolt in Euboea (probably paid for by Philip's gold). The Macedonian king finally took Olynthus in 348 BC and razed the city to the ground. The same fate was inflicted on other cities of the Chalcidian peninsula.\n\nMacedon and the regions adjoining it having now been securely consolidated, Philip celebrated his [[Olympic Games]] at [[Dion, Greece|Dium]]. In 347 BC, Philip advanced to the conquest of the eastern districts about Hebrus, and compelled the submission of the [[Odrysian kingdom|Thracian]] prince [[Cersobleptes]]. In 346 BC, he intervened effectively in the war between Thebes and the Phocians, but his wars with Athens continued intermittently. However, Athens had made overtures for peace, and when Philip again moved south, peace was sworn in Thessaly.<ref name=\"Bevan1911\" />\n\n===Later campaigns (346\u2013336 BC)===\nWith key Greek city-states in submission, Philip II turned to [[Sparta]]; he sent them a message: \"If I win this war, you will be slaves forever.\" In another version, he warned: \"You are advised to submit without further delay, for if I bring my army into your land, I will destroy your farms, slay your people, and raze your city.\" According to both accounts, the Spartans' [[laconic]] reply was one word: \"If.\" Philip II and Alexander both chose to leave Sparta alone. Later, Macedonian arms were carried across Epirus to the [[Adriatic Sea]].<ref name=\"Bevan1911\" />\n\nIn 345 BC, Philip conducted a hard-fought campaign against the Ardiaioi ([[Ardiaei]]), under their king [[Pleuratus I]], during which Philip was seriously wounded in the lower right leg by an Ardian soldier.<ref>Ashley, James R., The Macedonian Empire: The Era of Warfare Under Philip II and Alexander the Great, 359\u2013323 BCE., McFarland, 2004, p. 114, {{ISBN|0-7864-1918-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 342 BC, Philip led a great military expedition north against the [[Scythians]], conquering the Thracian fortified settlement Eumolpia to give it his name, ''Philippopolis'' (modern [[Plovdiv]]).\n\nIn 340 BC, Philip started the siege of [[Marmara Ere\u011fli|Perinthus]]. Philip began another siege in 339 of the city of [[Byzantium]]. After unsuccessful sieges of both cities, Philip's influence all over Greece was compromised.<ref name=\"Bevan1911\" /> However, he successfully reasserted his authority in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] by defeating an alliance of Thebans and Athenians at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] in 338 BC, while in the same year, Philip destroyed [[Amfissa]] because the residents had illegally cultivated part of the Crisaian plain which belonged to [[Delphi]].\n\nIn 336 BC, Philip and Alexander the Great were honored with numerous decrees passed by the Assembly Presidents proposed by Athenian Philippides of Paiania for their triumph at Chaeronea. Philippides also succored Philip's campaign in Eleuthera, Tenegra and Thebes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Edward |title=Dinarchus, Hyperides,& Lycurgus |date=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=0-292-79143-7 |pages=80\u201382}}</ref>\n\nIt was these decisive victories that finally secured Philip's position, with the majority of Greece under Macedonian sovereignty.\n\nPhilip created and led the [[League of Corinth]] in 337 BC. Members of the League agreed never to wage war against each other, unless it was to suppress [[revolution]]. Philip was elected as leader (''[[Hegemony|hegemon]]'') of the army of invasion against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].\n\n===Asian campaign (336 BC)===\nPhilip II was involved quite early against the Achaemenid Empire. From around 352 BC, he supported several Persian opponents to [[Artaxerxes III]], such as [[Artabazos II]], [[Amminapes]] or a Persian nobleman named [[Sisines]], by receiving them for several years as exiles at the Macedonian court.<ref name=\"JM\">{{cite book |last1=Morgan |first1=Janett |title=Greek Perspectives on the Achaemenid Empire: Persia Through the Looking Glass |date=2016 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-4724-8 |page=271 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49JVDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA271 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"NC\">{{cite book |last1=Cawthorne |first1=Nigel |title=Alexander the Great |date=2004 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=978-1-904341-56-7 |pages=42\u201343 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxyz0v9T74sC&pg=PA42 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Briant |first1=Pierre |title=Alexander the Great and His Empire: A Short Introduction |date=2012 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-15445-9 |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAW6kmL30RUC&pg=PA114 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"EJ\">{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Erik |title=Barbarians in the Greek and Roman World |date=2018 |publisher=Hackett Publishing |isbn=978-1-62466-714-5 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCRtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA92 |language=en}}</ref> This gave him a good knowledge of Persian issues, and may even have influenced some of his innovations in the management of the Macedonian state.<ref name=\"JM\" /> The future Alexander the Great, son of Philip, was also acquainted with these Persian exiles during his youth.<ref name=\"NC\" /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=Timothy |last2=Brice |first2=Lee L. |title=Brill's Companion to Insurgency and Terrorism in the Ancient Mediterranean |date=2015 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-28473-9 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=248DCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA170 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"EDC\">{{cite book |last1=Carney |first1=Elizabeth Donnelly |title=Women and Monarchy in Macedonia |date=2000 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=978-0-8061-3212-9 |page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbI2hZBy_EkC&pg=PA101 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 336 BC, Philip II sent [[Parmenion]], with [[Amyntas (son of Andromenes)|Amyntas]], Andromenes and [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]], and an army of 10,000 men into [[Asia Minor]] to make preparations for an invasion to free the Greeks living on the western coast and islands from Achaemenid rule.<ref name=\"PB\">{{cite book |last1=Briant |first1=Pierre |title=From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire |date=2002 |publisher=Eisenbrauns |isbn=978-1-57506-120-7 |page=817 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxQ9W6F1oSYC&pg=PA817 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"WH\">{{cite book |last1=Heckel |first1=Waldemar |title=Who's Who in the Age of Alexander the Great: Prosopography of Alexander's Empire |date=2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-4051-5469-7 |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NR4Wn9VU8vkC&pg=PT205 |language=en}}</ref>  At first, all went well. The Greek cities on the western coast of Anatolia revolted until the news arrived that Philip had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son Alexander.

The court had gathered there for the celebration of the marriage between [[Alexander I of Epirus]] and [[Cleopatra of Macedon]], who was Philip's daughter by his fourth wife [[Olympias]]. While the king was entering unprotected into the town's theatre (highlighting his approachability to the Greek diplomats present), he was killed by [[Pausanias of Orestis]], one of his seven bodyguards. The assassin immediately tried to escape and reach his associates who were waiting for him with horses at the entrance to Aegae. He was pursued by three of Philip's bodyguards, tripped on a vine, and died by their hands.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe reasons for the assassination are difficult to expound fully: There was already controversy among ancient historians, and the only contemporary account in our possession is that of [[Aristotle]], who states rather tersely that Philip was killed because Pausanias had been offended by the followers of [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]], uncle of Philip's wife [[Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon|Cleopatra]] (renamed Eurydice upon marriage).\n\n===Cleitarchus' analysis===\nFifty years later, the historian [[Cleitarchus]] expanded and embellished the story. Centuries later, this version was to be narrated by [[Diodorus Siculus]] and all the historians who used Cleitarchus. According to the sixteenth book of Diodorus' history,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holoka.com/diodorus%20on%20philip.htm |author=Diodorus Siculus |title=The Library of History |id=16.91-95 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304065912/http://www.holoka.com/diodorus%20on%20philip.htm |archive-date=2010-03-04 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Pausanias of Orestis had been a lover of Philip, but became jealous when Philip turned his attention to a younger man, also called Pausanias. The elder Pausanias' taunting of the new lover caused the younger Pausanias to throw away his life in battle, which turned his friend Attalus against the elder Pausanias. Attalus took his revenge by getting Pausanias of Orestis drunk at a public dinner and then raping him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nWhen Pausanias complained to Philip, the king felt unable to chastise Attalus, as he was about to send him to Asia with [[Parmenion]], to establish a bridgehead for his planned invasion. Philip also was recently married to Attalus' niece, [[Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon|Cleopatra Eurydice]]. Rather than offend Attalus, Philip tried to mollify Pausanias by elevating him within his personal bodyguard. Pausanias' desire for revenge seems to have turned towards the man who had failed to avenge his damaged honour, so he planned to kill Philip. Some time after the alleged rape, while Attalus was away in Asia fighting the Persians, he put his plan in action.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Justin's analysis===\nOther historians (e.g., [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] 9.7) suggested that Alexander and/or his mother [[Olympias]] were at least privy to the intrigue, if not themselves instigators. The latter seems to have been anything but discreet in manifesting her gratitude to Pausanias, according to Justin's report: He writes that the same night of her return from exile, she placed a crown on the assassin's corpse, and later erected a [[tumulus]] over his grave and ordering annual sacrifices to the memory of Pausanias.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Modern analysis===\n[[File:Assassination of Philip of Macedon.jpg|thumb|Assassination of Philip of Macedon. 19th century illustration.]]\nMany modern historians have observed that '''''all''''' the accounts are improbable: In the case of Pausanias, the stated motive of the crime hardly seems adequate. On the other hand, the implication of Alexander and Olympias seems specious \u2013 to act as they did would have required brazen effrontery in the face of a military personally loyal to Philip. What seems to be recorded are the natural suspicions that fell on the chief beneficiaries of the assassination, however their actions in response to the murder cannot prove their guilt in the crime itself \u2013 regardless of how sympathetic they might have seemed afterward.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nWhatever the actual background to the assassination, it may have had an enormous effect on later world history, far beyond what any conspirators could have predicted. As asserted by some modern historians, had the older and more settled Philip been the one in charge of the war against Persia, he might have rested content with relatively moderate conquests, e.g., making [[Anatolia]] into a Macedonian province, and not pushed further into an overall conquest of Persia and further campaigns in India.<ref>{{cite book |author-first=Laurence T. |author-last=Stevens |contribution=The Assassin who Launched the Hellenistic Age |editor-first=Jane |editor-last=Trent |title=Is History Made by Accident?}}</ref>\n\n==Marriages==\n[[File:Philip II statue 350-400 CE.jpg|thumb|Statue of Philip II, 350-400 CE.

In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php |archivedate=21 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship | title=Author battles 'censorship' | newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard | first=Geoffrey | last=Johnston | date=1 June 2017 | accessdate=12 July 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Death in October.''

It purports to be the charter by which \u00c6thelred granted 300 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] (about 36,000 acres) at Gloucester to King [[Osric, king of the Hwicce|Osric of the Hwicce]], and another 300 at Pershore to Osric's brother Oswald.<ref name=Sims94-6>Sims-Williams, ''Religion and literature'', pp. 94-6.</ref><ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+70 S 70]</ref> It is preserved only as a copy in a 14th-century register of Gloucester, where it is followed by two charters listing the endowments made to the abbey until the reign of Link [[Burgred of Mercia]] (852-874).<ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+209 S 209]</ref><ref name=S1782>[http://www.esawyer.org.uk/content/charter/1782.html S 1782]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The 300 hides mentioned here are unlikely to be a contemporary detail, as they were intended to represent the triple [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]] which later made up the area of Worcestershire.<ref name=Sims94-6 /> Historian [[H. P. R. Finberg]] suggests that the foundation charter may have been drafted in the 9th century, based on some authentic material.<ref>Finberg, ''Early charters'', pp. 153-66.</ref> Oswald's foundation of a monastery at Pershore is not stated explicitly in the charter, but the Worcester chronicle ''[[Cronica de Anglia]]'', written ''c''. 1150, reports it under the annal for 683, and [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], consulting the now lost ''Annals of Pershore'', places the event around 689.<ref name=Sims94-6 /><ref>John Leland, ''Collectanea'', ed. Hearne, pp. 240-1.</ref> Patrick Sims-Williams suggests that the foundation by Oswald may also represent an oral tradition at Pershore, as its archives were probably destroyed in fires of the 1002 and 1223.<ref name=Sims94-6 />\n\nIn the 9th century, Pershore comes to light again as a ministry under the patronage of [[List of monarchs of Mercia|Mercian kings]]. In other charters contained in the Gloucester register, [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Coenwulf]] (r. 796-821) and Burgred are recorded as having been patrons of Pershore.<ref name=S1782 /> A charter of [[Edgar the Peaceful|King Edgar]] refers back to a grant of privileges by Coenwulf at the request of his [[ealdorman]] (''[[dux]]'') Beornnoth.<ref name=Sims94-6 /><ref name=S786>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+786 S 786]</ref>\n\n===Refoundation===\nIn the reign of King Edgar (959-975), Pershore reappears as one of the abbeys to be re-established (or restored) under the programme of [[Benedictine]] reform. Writing ''c''. 1000, the Ramsey monk [[Byrhtferth]] relates that under the auspices of [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald, bishop of Worcester]], seven monasteries were founded in his diocese, notably including Pershore.<ref>Byrhtferth, ''Life of Oswald'', p. 494 (ch. 8).</ref> The first abbot was one Foldbriht,<ref>Byrhtferth, ''Life of Oswald'', pp. 494-5 (ch. 9).</ref> whose name is sufficiently rare to suggest that he may be the same Foldbriht whom Bishop [[\u00c6thelwold]] previously installed at [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]] and used to be a monk of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]] before that time.<ref>Hudson, ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis'', p. cciii.</ref>\n\nThe refoundation is what lies behind an exceptionally elaborate charter for Pershore, dated 972, in which King Edgar is presented as granting new lands and privileges as well as confirming old ones, such as the one granted by Coenwulf.<ref name=S786 /> The authenticity of this document, however, has been questioned. [[Simon Keynes]] in 1980 showed that it belongs to the so-called ''Orthodoxorum'' group of charters, so named after the initial word of their [[Preface|proem]], which he concluded were forgeries based on a charter of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred II]]'s reign.<ref>Keynes, ''The diplomas of King \u00c6thelred 'the Unready' 978-1016'', pp. 98-100</ref> Since then, Susan Kelly and John Hudson have vindicated the status of some of these charters, including the one for Pershore, which is written in square minuscule characteristic of some of Edgar's charters.<ref>Hudson, ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis'', pp. cxcix-cciv</ref> More recently, Peter Stokes has brought to light a variant copy of the charter and suggests that two different versions may have been produced around the same time, somewhere between 972 and 1066. A possible scenario is that they were produced to make up for the loss of the original charter(s), perhaps shortly after the fire which is reported to have destroyed the abbey in ''c''. 1002 (see below).<ref name=Stokes72-3>Stokes, \"King Edgar's charter for Pershore, 972\", pp. 72-3.</ref>\n\nThe 12th-century historian [[William of Malmesbury]], who seems unaware of any pre-existing minster, claims that one \u00c6thelweard (''Egelwardus''), whom he describes as \"ealdorman of Dorset\", had founded the abbey of Pershore in the time of King Edgar.<ref name=Gesta-iv.162>William of Malmesbury, ''Gesta pontificum'' IV, ch. 162, ed. and tr, Winterbottom and Thomson</ref> Similarly, [[Osbert de Clare|Osbert]]'s ''Life'' of [[Eadburh of Winchester]] alleges that one ''Alwardus'', who is styled ''comes'' and ''consul'', was responsible for the refoundation. Both authors also attribute to him a role in the translation of some of the saint's relics to Pershore. Osbert writes that an abbess of Nunnaminster had sold some relics to \u00c6thelweard (''Alwardus''), who in turn handed them over for the refoundation of Pershore.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ridyard, ''The royal saints of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref> Some scholars have identified him with [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], the well-known chronicler and ealdorman of the western shires.<ref name=World11-3>Williams, ''World before Domesday'', pp. 11-3.</ref> {{#tag:ref|A tradition at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]], only 10&nbsp;miles from Pershore, also remembers a royal kinsman called \u00c6thelweard (''Haylwardus'') as its patron as well as that of [[Cranborne Abbey]] (Dorset), of which Tewkesbury was a dependency.<ref name=World11-3 /><ref name=reform347>Jayakumar, \"Reform and retribution\", p. 347.</ref> The account, which places his floruit in the time of King \u00c6thelred and Dunstan, is recorded in a late chronicle of that house, written in the 15th century, but may very well be based on older sources.<ref name=World11-3 /><ref name=reform347 /> This \u00c6thelweard is to be identified with the \u00c6thelweard ''M\u00e6w'' whose activities, including the foundation of Cranborne, are attested in sources closer to his day.<ref name=World11-3 /> Historian Jayakumar suggests that he may be the chronicler [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], ealdorman of the western shires, as both were royal kinsmen and in the Tewkesbury Chronicle, Cranborne is said to have been founded ''in suo dominio''.<ref name=reform347 /> Ann Williams, however, prefers to see them as separate persons.<ref name=World11-3 />|group=note}}\n\nWhatever high-level patronage the foundation may have received, it was not enough to sustain its fortunes for very long. Precisely what happened to Pershore in the later 10th century is poorly documented, but some sources seem to hint that it went into decline during the succession crisis which emerged in the wake of King Edgar's death.<ref name=Williams167-8>Williams, \"''Princeps Merciorum gentis''\", pp. 167-8</ref> William of Malmesbury says that \"it, too, like the others, decayed to a pitiful extent, and was reduced by more than a half\".<ref name=Gesta-iv.162 /> According to Leland, the ''Annals of Pershore'' hold an earl called ''Delfer'' responsible for depriving the abbey of several of its lands. This ''Delfer'' has been interpreted as a misreading for [[\u00c6lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6lfhere]] (d. 983), ealdorman of Mercia<ref name=Williams167-8 /> (whom Leland mentions elsewhere).<ref name=LelandIter>\"Oswaldus ''primum instituit Canonicos seculares apud'' Persore.{{Clear}} ''Postea fuit ibidem chorus monachorum''.{{Clear}}''Rursus Canonici inducti''.{{Clear}}''Postea monachi per'' Edgarum.{{Clear}} Elferus ''abstulit pr\u00e6dia monachis''.{{Clear}}Odda ''comes ejus filius restituit''.{{Clear}}''Monasterium conflagravit & \u00e0 monachis desertum est''.{{Clear}}''Monachi'' Westmonasterienses ''pr\u00e6dia usurpabant''.{{Clear}}Wada ''comes attulit reliqias S.''

Hearne, vol. 5, p. 2.</ref> While himself a patron of Ely and Abingdon, \u00c6lfhere was also charged with despoiling reformed monasteries during [[Edward the Martyr]]'s brief reign (975-978). The targets included houses refounded by Bishop Oswald or Bishop \u00c6thelwold and considerably enriched under the patronage of \u00c6thelstan Half-King's sons, notably [[\u00c6thelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia|\u00c6thelwine, ealdorman of East Anglia]]. [[Evesham Abbey]], for instance, as later reported by [[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham|its own chronicle]], also claimed to have lost several of its lands in this way, and [[Winchcombe]] was disbanded altogether. \u00c6thelwine, in his turn, was remembered at Ely as a despoiler of its lands. Tensions between \u00c6lfhere and Bishop Oswald, whose authorities overlapped, and between \u00c6lfhere and \u00c6thelwine, with whom Oswald maintained a close relationship, are therefore likely to have been the principal cause of the upheaval.<ref name=Williams167-8 /> Whether a liberty similar to that of [[Oswaldslow (hundred)|Oswaldslow]] was an extra cause for concern, compromising \u00c6lfhere's authority as ealdorman, cannot be ascertained from the sources.<ref name=Williams167-8 />\n\n===\"Second\" refoundation===\n[[File:Pershore Abbey Nave.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The chancel]]\nPershore suffered worse misfortune when, according to Leland, it was destroyed by fire and subsequently deserted by the monks,<ref name=LelandIter /><ref name=Victoria /> probably in the year 1002.<ref name=ODNBOdda>Williams, \"Odda, earl (''d''. 1056)\"</ref> The monastic archives were largely lost in the event, as no original record from before that date survives today.<ref name=ODNBOdda /> Pershore, however, found a generous patron in the wealthy nobleman [[Odda of Deerhurst]] (d. 1056), who restored many of its lands and granted new ones. It has been suggested{{who|date=April 2019}} that he was a kinsman of the ealdorman \u00c6thelweard. The earliest extant record from the archive of Pershore, a charter of 1014 by which King \u00c6thelred granted Mathon (Herefordshire) to ealdorman Leofwine, may testify to Odda's restorations of lands to the house.<ref name=ODNBOdda /><ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+932 S 932].</ref> The monastery was active again by the 1020s, as its abbot Brihtheah was promoted bishop of Worcester in 1033.<ref name=ODNBOdda /> Odda's brother \u00c6lfric was buried at Pershore in 1053, joined three years later by Odda himself.<ref name=ODNBOdda />\n\nIn Odda's lifetime the total landed assets of Pershore grew to 300 hides, but after the loss of its benefactor in 1056 about two-thirds were seized and given to [[Edward the Confessor]]'s new foundation at Westminster.<ref name=ODNBOdda /> The original single sheet which preserves the fullest version of King Edgar's refoundation charter (though it need not be authentic) is marked by a number of textual alterations and erasures. Some of these changes may suggest a response to the abbey's proprietary struggles.<ref name=Stokes72-3 />\n\nFrom the early 12th century there is evidence that Pershore Abbey claimed possession of some of the relics of Saint [[Eadburh of Winchester]], the [[saint]]ed daughter of King [[Edward the Elder]]. Her body was initially buried at [[Nunnaminster]] (Winchester), but it was translated in the 960s to a more central spot in [[Winchester]], and again to a shrine in the 970s. Among several possibilities, Susan Ridyard has suggested that the Eadburh whose relics were preserved at Pershore may have been a Mercian saint of that name whose identity had become obscure.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Later Middle Ages===\nThe main building was begun in about 1100.  In the fourteenth century it benefitted from the generosity of [[Adam de Harvington]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] 1327\u201330, who was probably related to the Abbot, William of Harvington. The abbey was [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] in 1539. A monk of Pershore, named Richard Beerly, was one of those who gave evidence to [[Thomas Cromwell]] in 1536 about the misbehaviour of some of his brothers, writing that \"Monckes drynk an bowll after collacyon tell ten or xii of the clock, and cum to mattens as dronck as myss, and sume at cardes, sume at dyss.\"{{refn|{{cite book|editor-last=Wright|editor-first=Thomas|series=Camden Society Old Series: Volume XXVI|title=Three Chapters of Letters Relating to the Suppression of Monasteries|chapter=LX.

It purports to be the charter by which \u00c6thelred granted 300 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] (about 36,000 acres) at Gloucester to King [[Osric, king of the Hwicce|Osric of the Hwicce]], and another 300 at Pershore to Osric's brother Oswald.<ref name=Sims94-6>Sims-Williams, ''Religion and literature'', pp. 94-6.</ref><ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+70 S 70]</ref> It is preserved only as a copy in a 14th-century register of Gloucester, where it is followed by two charters listing the endowments made to the abbey until the reign of Link [[Burgred of Mercia]] (852-874).<ref>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+209 S 209]</ref><ref name=S1782>[http://www.esawyer.org.uk/content/charter/1782.html S 1782]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The 300 hides mentioned here are unlikely to be a contemporary detail, as they were intended to represent the triple [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]] which later made up the area of Worcestershire.<ref name=Sims94-6 /> Historian [[H. P. R. Finberg]] suggests that the foundation charter may have been drafted in the 9th century, based on some authentic material.<ref>Finberg, ''Early charters'', pp. 153-66.</ref> Oswald's foundation of a monastery at Pershore is not stated explicitly in the charter, but the Worcester chronicle ''[[Cronica de Anglia]]'', written ''c''. 1150, reports it under the annal for 683, and [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], consulting the now lost ''Annals of Pershore'', places the event around 689.<ref name=Sims94-6 /><ref>John Leland, ''Collectanea'', ed. Hearne, pp. 240-1.</ref> Patrick Sims-Williams suggests that the foundation by Oswald may also represent an oral tradition at Pershore, as its archives were probably destroyed in fires of 1002 and again in 1223.<ref name=Sims94-6 />\n\nIn the 9th century, Pershore comes to light again as a minster under the patronage of [[List of monarchs of Mercia|Mercian kings]]. In other charters contained in the Gloucester register, [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Coenwulf]] (r. 796-821) and Burgred are recorded as having been patrons of Pershore.<ref name=S1782 /> A charter of [[Edgar the Peaceful|King Edgar]] refers back to a grant of privileges by Coenwulf at the request of his [[ealdorman]] (''[[dux]]'') Beornnoth.<ref name=Sims94-6 /><ref name=S786>[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query=S+786 S 786]</ref>\n\n===Refoundation===\nIn the reign of King Edgar (959-975), Pershore reappears as one of the abbeys to be re-established (or restored) under the programme of [[Benedictine]] reform. Writing ''c''. 1000, the Ramsey monk [[Byrhtferth]] relates that under the auspices of [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald, bishop of Worcester]], seven monasteries were founded in his diocese, notably including Pershore.<ref>Byrhtferth, ''Life of Oswald'', p. 494 (ch. 8).</ref> The first abbot was one Foldbriht,<ref>Byrhtferth, ''Life of Oswald'', pp. 494-5 (ch. 9).</ref> whose name is sufficiently rare to suggest that he may be the same Foldbriht whom Bishop [[\u00c6thelwold]] previously installed at [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]] and used to be a monk of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]] before that time.<ref>Hudson, ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis'', p. cciii.</ref>\n\nThe refoundation is what lies behind an exceptionally elaborate charter for Pershore, dated 972, in which King Edgar is presented as granting new lands and privileges as well as confirming old ones, such as the one granted by Coenwulf.<ref name=S786 /> The authenticity of this document, however, has been questioned. [[Simon Keynes]] in 1980 showed that it belongs to the so-called ''Orthodoxorum'' group of charters, so named after the initial word of their [[Preface|proem]], which he concluded were forgeries based on a charter of [[\u00c6thelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred II]]'s reign.<ref>Keynes, ''The diplomas of King \u00c6thelred 'the Unready' 978-1016'', pp. 98-100</ref> Since then, Susan Kelly and John Hudson have vindicated the status of some of these charters, including the one for Pershore, which is written in square minuscule characteristic of some of Edgar's charters.<ref>Hudson, ''Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis'', pp. cxcix-cciv</ref> More recently, Peter Stokes has brought to light a variant copy of the charter and suggests that two different versions may have been produced around the same time, somewhere between 972 and 1066. A possible scenario is that they were produced to make up for the loss of the original charter(s), perhaps shortly after the fire which is reported to have destroyed the abbey in ''c''. 1002 (see below).<ref name=Stokes72-3>Stokes, \"King Edgar's charter for Pershore, 972\", pp. 72-3.</ref>\n\nThe 12th-century historian [[William of Malmesbury]], who seems unaware of any pre-existing minster, claims that one \u00c6thelweard (''Egelwardus''), whom he describes as \"ealdorman of Dorset\", had founded the abbey of Pershore in the time of King Edgar.<ref name=Gesta-iv.162>William of Malmesbury, ''Gesta pontificum'' IV, ch. 162, ed. and tr, Winterbottom and Thomson</ref> Similarly, [[Osbert de Clare|Osbert]]'s ''Life'' of [[Eadburh of Winchester]] alleges that one ''Alwardus'', who is styled ''comes'' and ''consul'', was responsible for the refoundation. Both authors also attribute to him a role in the translation of some of the saint's relics to Pershore. Osbert writes that an abbess of Nunnaminster had sold some relics to \u00c6thelweard (''Alwardus''), who in turn handed them over for the refoundation of Pershore.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ridyard, ''The royal saints of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref> Some scholars have identified him with [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], the well-known chronicler and ealdorman of the western shires.<ref name=World11-3>Williams, ''World before Domesday'', pp. 11-3.</ref> {{#tag:ref|A tradition at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]], only 10&nbsp;miles from Pershore, also remembers a royal kinsman called \u00c6thelweard (''Haylwardus'') as its patron as well as that of [[Cranborne Abbey]] (Dorset), of which Tewkesbury was a dependency.<ref name=World11-3 /><ref name=reform347>Jayakumar, \"Reform and retribution\", p. 347.</ref> The account, which places his floruit in the time of King \u00c6thelred and Dunstan, is recorded in a late chronicle of that house, written in the 15th century, but may very well be based on older sources.<ref name=World11-3 /><ref name=reform347 /> This \u00c6thelweard is to be identified with the \u00c6thelweard ''M\u00e6w'' whose activities, including the foundation of Cranborne, are attested in sources closer to his day.<ref name=World11-3 /> Historian Jayakumar suggests that he may be the chronicler [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], ealdorman of the western shires, as both were royal kinsmen and in the Tewkesbury Chronicle, Cranborne is said to have been founded ''in suo dominio''.<ref name=reform347 /> Ann Williams, however, prefers to see them as separate persons.<ref name=World11-3 />|group=note}}\n\nWhatever high-level patronage the foundation may have received, it was not enough to sustain its fortunes for very long. Precisely what happened to Pershore in the later 10th century is poorly documented, but some sources seem to hint that it went into decline during the succession crisis which emerged in the wake of King Edgar's death.<ref name=Williams167-8>Williams, \"''Princeps Merciorum gentis''\", pp. 167-8</ref> William of Malmesbury says that \"it, too, like the others, decayed to a pitiful extent, and was reduced by more than a half\".<ref name=Gesta-iv.162 /> According to Leland, the ''Annals of Pershore'' hold an earl called ''Delfer'' responsible for depriving the abbey of several of its lands. This ''Delfer'' has been interpreted as a misreading for [[\u00c6lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia|\u00c6lfhere]] (d. 983), ealdorman of Mercia<ref name=Williams167-8 /> (whom Leland mentions elsewhere).<ref name=LelandIter>\"Oswaldus ''primum instituit Canonicos seculares apud'' Persore.{{Clear}} ''Postea fuit ibidem chorus monachorum''.{{Clear}}''Rursus Canonici inducti''.{{Clear}}''Postea monachi per'' Edgarum.{{Clear}} Elferus ''abstulit pr\u00e6dia monachis''.{{Clear}}Odda ''comes ejus filius restituit''.{{Clear}}''Monasterium conflagravit & \u00e0 monachis desertum est''.{{Clear}}''Monachi'' Westmonasterienses ''pr\u00e6dia usurpabant''.{{Clear}}Wada ''comes attulit reliqias S.''

The targets included houses refounded by Bishop Oswald or Bishop \u00c6thelwold and considerably enriched under the patronage of \u00c6thelstan Half-King's sons, notably [[\u00c6thelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia|\u00c6thelwine, ealdorman of East Anglia]]. [[Evesham Abbey]], for instance, as later reported by [[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham|its own chronicle]], also claimed to have lost several of its lands in this way, and [[Winchcombe]] was disbanded altogether. \u00c6thelwine, in his turn, was remembered at Ely as a despoiler of its lands. Tensions between \u00c6lfhere and Bishop Oswald, whose authorities overlapped, and between \u00c6lfhere and \u00c6thelwine, with whom Oswald maintained a close relationship, are therefore likely to have been the principal cause of the upheaval.<ref name=Williams167-8 /> Whether a liberty similar to that of [[Oswaldslow (hundred)|Oswaldslow]] was an extra cause for concern, compromising \u00c6lfhere's authority as ealdorman, cannot be ascertained from the sources.<ref name=Williams167-8 />\n\n===\"Second\" refoundation===\n[[File:Pershore Abbey Nave.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The chancel]]\nPershore suffered worse misfortune when, according to Leland, it was destroyed by fire and subsequently deserted by the monks,<ref name=LelandIter /><ref name=Victoria /> probably in the year 1002.<ref name=ODNBOdda>Williams, \"Odda, earl (''d''. 1056)\"</ref> The monastic archives were largely lost in the event, as no original record from before that date survives today.<ref name=ODNBOdda /> Pershore, however, found a generous patron in the wealthy nobleman [[Odda of Deerhurst]] (d. 1056), who restored many of its lands and granted new ones.

Her body was initially buried at [[Nunnaminster]] (Winchester), but it was translated in the 960s to a more central spot in [[Winchester]], and again to a shrine in the 970s. Among several possibilities, Susan Ridyard has suggested that the Eadburh whose relics were preserved at Pershore may have been a Mercian saint of that name whose identity had become obscure.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Later Middle Ages===\nThe main building was begun in about 1100.

The abbey was [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] in 1539.

The root is narrow, about 15&nbsp;cm long, 20&nbsp;cm in width, and is directed obliquely from the [[duodenojejunal flexure]] at the left side of the second [[lumbar vertebra]] to the right [[sacroiliac joint]]. The root of the mesentery extends from the duodenojejunal flexure to the [[ileocecal valve|ileocaecal junction]]. This section of the small intestine is located centrally in the abdominal cavity and lies behind the transverse colon and the [[greater omentum]].\n\nThe mesentery becomes attached to the [[large intestine|colon]] at the gastrointestinal margin and continues as the several regions of the mesocolon. The parts of the mesocolon take their names from the part of the colon to which they attach. These are the transverse mesocolon attaching to the transverse colon, the sigmoid mesocolon attaching to the sigmoid colon, the mesoappendix attaching to the appendix, and the mesorectum attaching to the upper third of the rectum.\n\nThe mesocolon regions were traditionally taught to be separate sections with separate insertions into the posterior abdominal wall. In 2012, the first detailed observational and [[histology|histological]] studies of the mesocolon were undertaken and this revealed several new findings.<ref name=\"Culligan\"/> The study included 109 patients undergoing open, elective, total abdominal [[colectomy]]. Anatomical observations were recorded during the surgery and on the post-operative specimens.\n\nThese studies showed that the mesocolon is continuous from the ileocaecal to the rectosigmoid level. It was also shown that a mesenteric confluence occurs at the ileocaecal and rectosigmoid junctions, as well as at the [[colic flexures|hepatic and splenic flexures]] and that each confluence involves peritoneal and omental attachments. The proximal rectum was shown to originate at the confluence of the mesorectum and mesosigmoid. A plane occupied by perinephric fascia was shown to separate the entire apposed small intestinal mesentery and the mesocolon from the [[retroperitoneum]]. Deep in the [[pelvis]], this fascia coalesces to give rise to [[presacral fascia]].<ref name=\"Culligan\"/>\n\n=== Flexural anatomy ===\nFlexural anatomy is frequently described as a difficult area. It is simplified when each flexure is considered as being centered on a mesenteric contiguity. The ileocaecal flexure arises at the point where the ileum is continuous with the caecum around the ileocaecal mesenteric flexure. Similarly, the [[Colic flexures|hepatic flexure]] is formed between the right mesocolon and transverse mesocolon at the mesenteric confluence. The colonic component of the hepatic flexure is draped around this mesenteric confluence. Furthermore, the [[colic flexures|splenic flexure]] is formed by the mesenteric confluence between the transverse and left mesocolon. The colonic component of the splenic flexure occurs lateral to the mesenteric confluence. At every flexure, a continuous peritoneal fold lies outside the colonic/mesocolic complex tethering this to the posterior abdominal wall.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/><ref name=\"Culligan\"/>\n\n===Mesocolon regions===\nThe '''transverse mesocolon''' is that section of the mesocolon attached to the [[transverse colon]] that lies between the [[colic flexures]].\n\nThe '''sigmoid mesocolon''' is that region of the mesentery to which the [[sigmoid colon]] is attached at the gastrointestinal mesenteric margin.\n\nThe '''mesoappendix''' is the portion of the mesocolon connecting the [[ileum]] to the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]]. It may extend to the tip of the appendix. It encloses the [[appendicular artery]] and vein, as well as [[lymph]]atic vessels, nerves, and often a [[lymph node]].\n\nThe '''mesorectum''' is that part attached to the upper third of the rectum.\n\n=== Peritoneal folds ===\nUnderstanding the macroscopic structure of the mesenteric organ meant that associated structures\u2014the peritoneal folds and congenital and omental adhesions\u2014could be better appraised. The small intestinal mesenteric fold occurs where the small intestinal mesentery folds onto the posterior abdominal wall and continues laterally as the right mesocolon. During mobilization of the small intestinal mesentery from the posterior abdominal wall, this fold is incised, allowing access to the interface between the small intestinal mesentery and the retroperitoneum. The fold continues at the inferolateral boundary of the ileocaecal junction and turn {{linktext|cephalad}} as the right paracolic peritoneal fold. This fold is divided during lateral to medial mobilization, permitting the surgeon to serially lift the right colon and associated mesentery off the underlying fascia and retroperitoneum. At the hepatic flexure, the right lateral peritoneal fold turns and continues medially as the hepatocolic peritoneal fold. Division of the fold in this location permits separation of the colonic component of the hepatic flexure and mesocolon off the retroperitoneum.<ref name=\"Coffey\" /><ref name=\"Culligan\" />\n\nInterposed between the hepatic and splenic flexures, the greater omentum adheres to the transverse colon along a further band or fold of peritoneum. Dissection through this allows access to the cephalad (top) surface of the transverse mesocolon. Focal adhesions frequently tether the greater omentum to the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. The left colon is associated with a similar anatomic configuration of peritoneal folds; the splenic peritoneal fold is contiguous with the left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold at the splenic flexure. Division of the latter similarly allows for the separation of the left colon and associated mesentery off the underlying fascia and frees it from the retroperitoneum. The left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold continues distally at the lateral aspect of the mobile component of the mesosigmoid.<ref name=\"Coffey\" /><ref name=\"Culligan\" />\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\nDetermination of the macroscopic structure of the mesenteric organ allowed a recent characterisation of the histological and electron microscopic properties.<ref name=\"pmid24441808\">{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Culligan K, Walsh S, Dunne C, etal|date=January 2014|title=The Mesocolon: A Histological and Electron Microscopic Characterization of the Mesenteric Attachment of the Colon Prior to and After Surgical Mobilization|url=https://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/10344/4895/1/Dunne_2014_surgical.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|journal=[[Annals of Surgery]]|volume=260|issue=6|pages=1048\u201356|doi=10.1097/SLA.0000000000000323|pmid=24441808|via=|hdl=10344/4895}}</ref> The microscopic structure of the mesocolon and associated fascia is consistent from ileocecal to mesorectal levels. A surface [[mesothelium]] and underlying connective tissue is universally apparent. [[Adipocytes]] lobules within the body of the mesocolon are separated by fibrous [[septae]] arising from submesothelial connective tissue. Where apposed to the retroperitoneum, two mesothelial layers separate the mesocolon and underlying retroperitoneum. Between these is [[Toldt's fascia]], a discrete layer of connective tissue. Lymphatic channels are evident in mesocolic connective tissue and in Toldt's fascia.<ref name=pmid24441808/>\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Gray987.png|thumb|300px|Two of the stages in the development of the digestive tube and its mesentery]]\n\n====Dorsal mesentery====\n[[File:Gray1038 vector.svg|240px|thumb|left|Mesentery in red.

Human embryo of six weeks.]]\n[[File: Gray989.png |thumb|Schematic figure of the bursa omentalis, etc. Human embryo of eight weeks.]]\nThe [[primitive gut]] is suspended from the posterior abdominal wall by the '''dorsal mesentery'''. The gastrointestinal tract and associated dorsal mesentery are subdivided into [[foregut]], [[midgut]], and [[hindgut]] regions based on the respective blood supply. The foregut is supplied by the [[celiac trunk]], the midgut is supplied by the [[superior mesenteric artery]] (SMA), and the hindgut is supplied by the [[inferior mesenteric artery]] (IMA). This division is established by the fourth week of [[human embryogenesis|development]]. After this, the midgut undergoes a period of rapid elongation, forcing it to herniate through the [[navel]]. During herniation, the midgut [[intestinal rotation|rotates]] 90\u00b0 anti-clockwise around the axis of the SMA and forms the midgut loop. The cranial portion of the loop moves to the right and the caudal portion of the loop moves toward the left. This [[intestinal rotation|rotation]] occurs at about the eighth week of development. The [[cranium|cranial]] portion of the loop will develop into the jejunum and most of the ileum, while the [[caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] part of the loop eventually forms the terminal portion of the ileum, the [[ascending colon]] and the initial two-thirds of the transverse colon. As the foetus grows larger, the mid-gut loop is drawn back through the umbilicus and undergoes a further 180\u00b0 rotation, completing a total of 270\u00b0 rotation. At this point, about 10 weeks, the [[caecum]] lies close to the [[liver]]. From here it moves in a cranial to caudal direction to eventually lie in the lower right portion of the abdominal cavity. This process brings the ascending colon to lie vertically in the lateral right portion of the abdominal cavity apposed to the posterior abdominal wall. The descending colon occupies a similar position on the left side.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Harold |last1=Ellis |first2=Vishy |last2=Mahadevan |date=April 2014 |title=Anatomy of the caecum, appendix and colon |journal=Surgery |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=155\u20138 |doi=10.1016/j.mpsur.2014.02.001}}</ref><ref name=\":7\">Mitchell B, Sharma R.

Most anatomical and embryological textbooks say that after adopting a final position, the ascending and descending mesocolons disappear during embryogenesis. ''Embryology\u2014An Illustrated Colour Text'', \"most of the mid-gut retains the original dorsal mesentery, though parts of the duodenum derived from the mid-gut do not.

The part of the dorsal mesentery that suspends the [[large intestine|colon]] is termed the [[mesocolon]]. The dorsal mesogastrium develops into the [[greater omentum]].\n\n====Ventral mesentery====\nThe development of the [[septum transversum]] takes part in the formation of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], while the caudal portion into which the [[liver]] grows forms the '''ventral mesentery'''. The part of the ventral mesentery that attaches to the [[stomach]] is known as the '''ventral mesogastrium'''.<ref name=gray>Gray's anatomy</ref>\n\nThe [[lesser omentum]] is formed, by a thinning of the mesoderm or ventral mesogastrium, which attaches the stomach and [[duodenum]] to the anterior [[abdominal wall]]. By the subsequent growth of the liver this leaf of mesoderm is divided into two parts \u2013 the [[lesser omentum]] between the stomach and liver, and the [[Falciform ligament|falciform]] and [[coronary ligament]]s between the liver and the abdominal wall and diaphragm.<ref name=gray/>\n\nIn the adult, the ventral mesentery is the part of the [[peritoneum]] closest to the [[navel]].\n\n==Clinical significance==\nClarifications of the mesenteric anatomy have facilitated a clearer understanding of diseases involving the mesentery, examples of which include [[malrotation]] and [[Crohn's disease]] (CD). In CD, the mesentery is frequently thickened, rendering [[hemostasis]] challenging. In addition, fat wrapping\u2014creeping fat\u2014involves extension of mesenteric fat over the circumference of contiguous gastrointestinal tract, and this may indicate increased mesothelial plasticity. The relationship between mesenteric derangements and mucosal manifestations in CD points to a pathobiological overlap; some authors say that CD is mainly a mesenteric disorder that secondarily affects the GIT and systemic circulation.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sahebally SM, Burke JP, Chang KH, Kiernan MG, O'Connell PR, Coffey JC |title=Circulating fibrocytes and Crohn's disease |journal=The British Journal of Surgery |volume=100 |issue=12 |pages=1549\u201356 |date=November 2013  |pmid=24264775 |doi=10.1002/bjs.9302}}</ref>\n\n[[Thrombosis]] of the [[superior mesenteric vein]] can cause [[mesenteric ischemia]] also known as ''ischemic bowel''.

These are highly variable among patients and occur in several locations. Congenital adhesions occur between the lateral aspect of the peritoneum overlying the mobile component of the mesosigmoid, and the parietal peritoneum in the left iliac fossa. During lateral to medial approach of mobilizing of the mesosigmoid, these must be divided first before the peritoneum proper can be accessed. Similarly, focal adhesions occur between the undersurface of the greater omentum and the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. These can be accessed after dividing the peritoneal fold that links the greater omentum and transverse colon. Adhesions here must be divided to separate the greater omentum off the transverse mesocolon, thus allowing access to the lesser sac proper.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/><ref name=\"Sehgal\"/>\n\n=== Surgery ===\nWhile the total mesocolic excision (TME) operation has become the surgical gold standard for the management of rectal cancer, this is not so for colon cancer.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/><ref name=\"Sehgal\">{{cite journal|last1=Sehgal|first1=R|last2=Coffey|first2=JC|title=The development of consensus for complete mesocolic excision (CME) should commence with standardisation of anatomy and related terminology.|journal=International Journal of Colorectal Disease|date=June 2014|volume=29|issue=6|pages=763\u20134|doi=10.1007/s00384-014-1852-8|pmid=24676507}}</ref>\nRecently, the surgical principles underpinning TME in rectal cancer have been extrapolated to colonic surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=West NP, Morris EJ, Rotimi O, Cairns A, Finan PJ, Quirke P |title=Pathology grading of colon cancer surgical resection and its association with survival: a retrospective observational study |journal=The Lancet Oncology |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=857\u201365 |date=September 2008  |pmid=18667357 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(08)70181-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=S\u00f8ndenaa K, Quirke P, Hohenberger W, etal |title=The rationale behind complete mesocolic excision (CME) and a central vascular ligation for colon cancer in open and laparoscopic surgery : proceedings of a consensus conference |journal=International Journal of Colorectal Disease |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=419\u201328 |date=April 2014  |pmid=24477788 |doi=10.1007/s00384-013-1818-2}}</ref> Total or complete mesocolic excision (CME), use planar surgery and extensive mesenterectomy (high tie) to minimise breach of the mesentery and maximise lymph nodes yield.

The root is narrow, about 15&nbsp;cm long, 20&nbsp;cm in width, and is directed obliquely from the [[duodenojejunal flexure]] at the left side of the second [[lumbar vertebra]] to the right [[sacroiliac joint]]. The root of the mesentery extends from the duodenojejunal flexure to the [[ileocecal valve|ileocaecal junction]]. This section of the small intestine is located centrally in the abdominal cavity and lies behind the transverse colon and the [[greater omentum]].\n\nThe mesentery becomes attached to the [[large intestine|colon]] at the gastrointestinal margin and continues as the several regions of the mesocolon. The parts of the mesocolon take their names from the part of the colon to which they attach. These are the transverse mesocolon attaching to the transverse colon, the sigmoid mesocolon attaching to the sigmoid colon, the mesoappendix attaching to the appendix, and the mesorectum attaching to the upper third of the rectum.\n\nThe mesocolon regions were traditionally taught to be separate sections with separate insertions into the posterior abdominal wall. In 2012, the first detailed observational and [[histology|histological]] studies of the mesocolon were undertaken and this revealed several new findings.<ref name=\"Culligan\"/> The study included 109 patients undergoing open, elective, total abdominal [[colectomy]]. Anatomical observations were recorded during the surgery and on the post-operative specimens.\n\nThese studies showed that the mesocolon is continuous from the ileocaecal to the rectosigmoid level. It was also shown that a mesenteric confluence occurs at the ileocaecal and rectosigmoid junctions, as well as at the [[colic flexures|hepatic and splenic flexures]] and that each confluence involves peritoneal and omental attachments. The proximal rectum was shown to originate at the confluence of the mesorectum and mesosigmoid. A plane occupied by perinephric fascia was shown to separate the entire apposed small intestinal mesentery and the mesocolon from the [[retroperitoneum]]. Deep in the [[pelvis]], this fascia coalesces to give rise to [[presacral fascia]].<ref name=\"Culligan\"/>\n\n=== Flexural anatomy ===\nFlexural anatomy is frequently described as a difficult area. It is simplified when each flexure is considered as being centered on a mesenteric contiguity. The ileocaecal flexure arises at the point where the ileum is continuous with the caecum around the ileocaecal mesenteric flexure. Similarly, the [[Colic flexures|hepatic flexure]] is formed between the right mesocolon and transverse mesocolon at the mesenteric confluence. The colonic component of the hepatic flexure is draped around this mesenteric confluence. Furthermore, the [[colic flexures|splenic flexure]] is formed by the mesenteric confluence between the transverse and left mesocolon. The colonic component of the splenic flexure occurs lateral to the mesenteric confluence. At every flexure, a continuous peritoneal fold lies outside the colonic/mesocolic complex tethering this to the posterior abdominal wall.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/><ref name=\"Culligan\"/>\n\n===Mesocolon regions===\nThe '''transverse mesocolon''' is that section of the mesocolon attached to the [[transverse colon]] that lies between the [[colic flexures]].\n\nThe '''sigmoid mesocolon''' is that region of the mesentery to which the [[sigmoid colon]] is attached at the gastrointestinal mesenteric margin.\n\nThe '''mesoappendix''' is the portion of the mesocolon connecting the [[ileum]] to the [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]]. It may extend to the tip of the appendix. It encloses the [[appendicular artery]] and vein, as well as [[lymph]]atic vessels, nerves, and often a [[lymph node]].\n\nThe '''mesorectum''' is that part attached to the upper third of the rectum.\n\n=== Peritoneal folds ===\nUnderstanding the macroscopic structure of the mesenteric organ meant that associated structures\u2014the peritoneal folds and congenital and omental adhesions\u2014could be better appraised. The small intestinal mesenteric fold occurs where the small intestinal mesentery folds onto the posterior abdominal wall and continues laterally as the right mesocolon. During mobilization of the small intestinal mesentery from the posterior abdominal wall, this fold is incised, allowing access to the interface between the small intestinal mesentery and the retroperitoneum. The fold continues at the inferolateral boundary of the ileocaecal junction and turn {{linktext|cephalad}} as the right paracolic peritoneal fold. This fold is divided during lateral to medial mobilization, permitting the surgeon to serially lift the right colon and associated mesentery off the underlying fascia and retroperitoneum. At the hepatic flexure, the right lateral peritoneal fold turns and continues medially as the hepatocolic peritoneal fold. Division of the fold in this location permits separation of the colonic component of the hepatic flexure and mesocolon off the retroperitoneum.<ref name=\"Coffey\" /><ref name=\"Culligan\" />\n\nInterposed between the hepatic and splenic flexures, the greater omentum adheres to the transverse colon along a further band or fold of peritoneum. Dissection through this allows access to the cephalad (top) surface of the transverse mesocolon. Focal adhesions frequently tether the greater omentum to the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. The left colon is associated with a similar anatomic configuration of peritoneal folds; the splenic peritoneal fold is contiguous with the left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold at the splenic flexure. Division of the latter similarly allows for the separation of the left colon and associated mesentery off the underlying fascia and frees it from the retroperitoneum. The left lateral paracolic peritoneal fold continues distally at the lateral aspect of the mobile component of the mesosigmoid.<ref name=\"Coffey\" /><ref name=\"Culligan\" />\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\nDetermination of the macroscopic structure of the mesenteric organ allowed a recent characterisation of the histological and electron microscopic properties.<ref name=\"pmid24441808\">{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Culligan K, Walsh S, Dunne C, etal|date=January 2014|title=The Mesocolon: A Histological and Electron Microscopic Characterization of the Mesenteric Attachment of the Colon Prior to and After Surgical Mobilization|url=https://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/10344/4895/1/Dunne_2014_surgical.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|journal=[[Annals of Surgery]]|volume=260|issue=6|pages=1048\u201356|doi=10.1097/SLA.0000000000000323|pmid=24441808|via=|hdl=10344/4895}}</ref> The microscopic structure of the mesocolon and associated fascia is consistent from ileocecal to mesorectal levels.

Where apposed to the retroperitoneum, two mesothelial layers separate the mesocolon and underlying retroperitoneum. Between these is [[Toldt's fascia]], a discrete layer of connective tissue. Lymphatic channels are evident in mesocolic connective tissue and in Toldt's fascia.<ref name=pmid24441808/>\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Gray987.png|thumb|300px|Two of the stages in the development of the digestive tube and its mesentery]]\n\n====Dorsal mesentery====\n[[File:Gray1038 vector.svg|240px|thumb|left|Mesentery in red.

Human embryo of six weeks.]]\n[[File: Gray989.png |thumb|Schematic figure of the bursa omentalis, etc. Human embryo of eight weeks.]]\nThe [[primitive gut]] is suspended from the posterior abdominal wall by the '''dorsal mesentery'''. The gastrointestinal tract and associated dorsal mesentery are subdivided into [[foregut]], [[midgut]], and [[hindgut]] regions based on the respective blood supply. The foregut is supplied by the [[celiac trunk]], the midgut is supplied by the [[superior mesenteric artery]] (SMA), and the hindgut is supplied by the [[inferior mesenteric artery]] (IMA). This division is established by the fourth week of [[human embryogenesis|development]]. After this, the midgut undergoes a period of rapid elongation, forcing it to herniate through the [[navel]]. During herniation, the midgut [[intestinal rotation|rotates]] 90\u00b0 anti-clockwise around the axis of the SMA and forms the midgut loop. The cranial portion of the loop moves to the right and the caudal portion of the loop moves toward the left. This [[intestinal rotation|rotation]] occurs at about the eighth week of development. The [[cranium|cranial]] portion of the loop will develop into the jejunum and most of the ileum, while the [[caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] part of the loop eventually forms the terminal portion of the ileum, the [[ascending colon]] and the initial two-thirds of the transverse colon. As the foetus grows larger, the mid-gut loop is drawn back through the umbilicus and undergoes a further 180\u00b0 rotation, completing a total of 270\u00b0 rotation. At this point, about 10 weeks, the [[caecum]] lies close to the [[liver]]. From here it moves in a cranial to caudal direction to eventually lie in the lower right portion of the abdominal cavity. This process brings the ascending colon to lie vertically in the lateral right portion of the abdominal cavity apposed to the posterior abdominal wall. The descending colon occupies a similar position on the left side.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Harold |last1=Ellis |first2=Vishy |last2=Mahadevan |date=April 2014 |title=Anatomy of the caecum, appendix and colon |journal=Surgery |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=155\u20138 |doi=10.1016/j.mpsur.2014.02.001}}</ref><ref name=\":7\">Mitchell B, Sharma R.

The dorsal mesogastrium develops into the [[greater omentum]].\n\n====Ventral mesentery====\nThe development of the [[septum transversum]] takes part in the formation of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], while the caudal portion into which the [[liver]] grows forms the '''ventral mesentery'''.

In CD, the mesentery is frequently thickened, rendering [[hemostasis]] challenging. In addition, fat wrapping\u2014creeping fat\u2014involves extension of mesenteric fat over the circumference of contiguous gastrointestinal tract, and this may indicate increased mesothelial plasticity. The relationship between mesenteric derangements and mucosal manifestations in CD points to a pathobiological overlap; some authors say that CD is mainly a mesenteric disorder that secondarily affects the GIT and systemic circulation.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sahebally SM, Burke JP, Chang KH, Kiernan MG, O'Connell PR, Coffey JC |title=Circulating fibrocytes and Crohn's disease |journal=The British Journal of Surgery |volume=100 |issue=12 |pages=1549\u201356 |date=November 2013  |pmid=24264775 |doi=10.1002/bjs.9302}}</ref>\n\n[[Thrombosis]] of the [[superior mesenteric vein]] can cause [[mesenteric ischemia]] also known as ''ischemic bowel''.

These are highly variable among patients and occur in several locations. Congenital adhesions occur between the lateral aspect of the peritoneum overlying the mobile component of the mesosigmoid, and the parietal peritoneum in the left iliac fossa. During lateral to medial approach of mobilizing of the mesosigmoid, these must be divided first before the peritoneum proper can be accessed. Similarly, focal adhesions occur between the undersurface of the greater omentum and the cephalad aspect of the transverse mesocolon. These can be accessed after dividing the peritoneal fold that links the greater omentum and transverse colon. Adhesions here must be divided to separate the greater omentum off the transverse mesocolon, thus allowing access to the lesser sac proper.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/><ref name=\"Sehgal\"/>\n\n=== Surgery ===\nWhile the total mesocolic excision (TME) operation has become the surgical gold standard for the management of rectal cancer, this is not so for colon cancer.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/><ref name=\"Sehgal\">{{cite journal|last1=Sehgal|first1=R|last2=Coffey|first2=JC|title=The development of consensus for complete mesocolic excision (CME) should commence with standardisation of anatomy and related terminology.|journal=International Journal of Colorectal Disease|date=June 2014|volume=29|issue=6|pages=763\u20134|doi=10.1007/s00384-014-1852-8|pmid=24676507}}</ref>\nRecently, the surgical principles underpinning TME in rectal cancer have been extrapolated to colonic surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=West NP, Morris EJ, Rotimi O, Cairns A, Finan PJ, Quirke P |title=Pathology grading of colon cancer surgical resection and its association with survival: a retrospective observational study |journal=The Lancet Oncology |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=857\u201365 |date=September 2008  |pmid=18667357 |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(08)70181-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=S\u00f8ndenaa K, Quirke P, Hohenberger W, etal |title=The rationale behind complete mesocolic excision (CME) and a central vascular ligation for colon cancer in open and laparoscopic surgery : proceedings of a consensus conference |journal=International Journal of Colorectal Disease |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=419\u201328 |date=April 2014  |pmid=24477788 |doi=10.1007/s00384-013-1818-2}}</ref> Total or complete mesocolic excision (CME), use planar surgery and extensive mesenterectomy (high tie) to minimise breach of the mesentery and maximise lymph nodes yield.
