In the video, Fischbach elaborated on his extensive personal background with firearms, revealing that his father was a member of the [[National Rifle Association]] and a proud gun owner, collector, and enthusiast who taught Fischbach about firearms from a very young age and how to handle them, shoot them and respect them. He stated that while he believes in the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] and supports [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|the right of people to keep and bear arms]], he does not believe that people should be allowed to access [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] [[assault rifle]]s, and thus believes they should be banned from civilian ownership. He further advocated for stringent licensing and registration requirements for firearm ownership in general as well as [[Mental health care in the United States|mental health reform]].

An ardent [[Serbophilia|Serbophile]], he attended school in [[Anatolia]] for several years before relocating to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and settling in its capital, [[Belgrade]]. In 1900, Karabegovi\u0107 and fellow Muslim Serbophiles [[Osman \u0110iki\u0107]] and [[Omer-beg Sulejmanpa\u0161i\u0107]] printed a book of Serbian patriotic poetry. Later that year, upon entering [[Austria-Hungary]] on a visit to neighbouring [[Zemun]], Karabegovi\u0107 was arrested for [[draft evasion]] by the Austro-Hungarian authorities and forcibly inducted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], where he contracted [[tuberculosis]].\n\nShortly after being discharged from the Austro-Hungarian Army, Karabegovi\u0107 was stripped of his Austrian citizenship. He subsequently returned to Serbia and completed teachers' college. In 1905, Karabegovi\u0107 published his second and final poetry collection. Later that year, he was hired to teach Muslim schoolchildren in the town of [[Mali Zvornik]], in western Serbia. By 1908, Karabegovi\u0107's health had deteriorated rapidly, and in November of that year, his friends took him to a hospital in the town of [[Loznica]], where he died the following month. His body was buried at Belgrade's [[Belgrade's New Cemetery|New Cemetery]].\n\n==Biography==\nAvdo Karabegovi\u0107 was born into a prominent but impoverished [[Muslim]] land-owning family in the town of [[Modri\u010da]], in northern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], on 25 August 1878. He was the son of Halim-beg and Fatima Karabegovi\u0107 ({{nee|Mustajbegovi\u0107}}).{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} The Karabegovi\u0107 clan is believed to have originated from the village of [[Budim Do]], in western [[Herzegovina]]. At the beginning of the 18th century, four brothers from the clan left the village and migrated northward, settling in [[Zenica]], Biha\u0107, [[Mostar]] and Modri\u010da, respectively.{{sfn|Kamberovi\u0107|2003|p=389}} Karabegovi\u0107 personally believed that he was descended from the medieval [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], which ruled the [[Principality of Zeta]] in the 15th century.{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}}\n\nKarabegovi\u0107 completed his [[primary education]] in Modri\u010da, where he also attended [[maktab]]. He became a published writer at the age of seventeen. His first work, a poem titled ''Zec'' (Rabbit), was published in the periodical ''Br\u0161ljan'' (Ivy) in 1895. His second poem, ''Srpstvu'' (To Serbdom), was published in the periodical ''Bosanska vila'' (Bosnian Nymph) in 1896.{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} Karabegovi\u0107 adopted the letter ''[[S]].'' as his first initial, which stood for ''Srbin'' ([[Serbs|Serb]]). This was done, in part, to emphasize his self-identification as a Serb, but also to distinguish himself from his cousin [[Avdo Karabegovi\u0107 Hasanbegov]].{{sfn|Banac|1984|p=363}} Karabegovi\u0107 did not shy away from proselytizing and openly espousing his [[Serbophilia|Serbophile]] convictions, going so far as to secretly teach the [[Latin alphabet]] to Hasanbegov, who had been forbidden from receiving a [[Western education]] by his father. After Hasanbegov began publishing pro-Serb periodicals in the Latin alphabet, his home was attacked by a mob.{{sfn|Okey|2007|p=105}}\n\nKarabegovi\u0107 subsequently relocated to the town of [[Adapazar\u0131]], in [[Anatolia]], where he attended a [[vocational school]]. In 1896, he enrolled in a [[lyceum]] in [[Constantinople]]. In 1898, having completed three years of study, Karabegovi\u0107 dropped out and relocated to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]].{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} He settled in [[Belgrade]], which was then home to one of the world's largest [[Bosnian Muslim]] diasporas, second only to Constantinople.{{sfn|Okey|2007|p=105}} In 1899, the writer [[Janko Veselinovi\u0107 (writer)|Janko Veselinovi\u0107]]'s publication ''Zvezda'' printed a Serbian patriotic poem that Karabegovi\u0107 had written.{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} In 1900, Karabegovi\u0107 and fellow Muslim Serbophiles [[Osman \u0110iki\u0107]] and [[Omer-beg Sulejmanpa\u0161i\u0107]] printed a book of Serbian patriotic poetry.{{sfn|Okey|2007|p=105}}{{sfn|Hajdarpa\u0161i\u0107|2015|p=121}} Later that same year, after crossing the Austro-Hungarian border to visit [[Zemun]], Karabegovi\u0107 was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian authorities for [[draft evasion]]. He was subsequently taken to [[Budapest]], and as a Habsburg subject, compelled to serve three years in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. It was during this time that he contracted [[tuberculosis]], which would plague him for the rest of his life.{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}}\n\nAfter being discharged from the Austro-Hungarian Army, Karabegovi\u0107 enrolled in a teachers' college in [[Pakrac]].{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} Due to his pro-Serb and anti-Habsburg convictions, he was soon stripped of his Austrian citizenship.{{sfn|Selimovi\u0107 6 March 2019}} In 1903, Karabegovi\u0107 relocated to [[Aleksinac]], in central Serbia, where he attended teachers' college. He graduated from teachers' college in 1905.{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} The same year, the Royal Serbian Government hired Karabegovi\u0107 to teach Muslim schoolchildren the town of [[Mali Zvornik]], in western Serbia.{{sfn|Hajdarpa\u0161i\u0107|2015|loc=p. 241, note 144}} Later that year, Karabegovi\u0107 published his second poetry collection, titled simply ''Pjesme'' (Poems). By 1908, Karabegovi\u0107's tuberculosis had worsened substantially. He initially sought treatment in Belgrade before relocating to [[Ulcinj]] in the hope that the town's warm climate would ameliorate his symptoms, to no avail. On the advice of his doctors, Karabegovi\u0107 returned to Mali Zvornik. On {{OldStyleDate|20 November|1908|7 November}}, Karabegovi\u0107's friends took him to a hospital in the town of [[Loznica]], where he died on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1908|5 December}}, aged 30.

An ardent [[Serbophilia|Serbophile]], he attended school in [[Anatolia]] for several years before relocating to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and settling in its capital, [[Belgrade]]. In 1900, Karabegovi\u0107 and fellow Muslim Serbophiles [[Osman \u0110iki\u0107]] and [[Omer-beg Sulejmanpa\u0161i\u0107]] printed a book of Serbian patriotic poetry. Later that year, upon entering [[Austria-Hungary]] on a visit to neighbouring [[Zemun]], Karabegovi\u0107 was arrested for [[draft evasion]] by the Austro-Hungarian authorities and forcibly inducted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], where he contracted [[tuberculosis]].\n\nShortly after being discharged from the Austro-Hungarian Army, Karabegovi\u0107 was stripped of his Austrian citizenship. He subsequently returned to Serbia and completed teachers' college. In 1905, Karabegovi\u0107 published his second and final poetry collection. Later that year, he was hired to teach Muslim schoolchildren in the town of [[Mali Zvornik]], in western Serbia. By 1908, Karabegovi\u0107's health had deteriorated rapidly, and in November of that year, his friends took him to a hospital in the town of [[Loznica]], where he died the following month. His body was buried at Belgrade's [[Belgrade's New Cemetery|New Cemetery]].\n\n==Biography==\nAvdo Karabegovi\u0107 was born into a prominent but impoverished [[Muslim]] land-owning family in the town of [[Modri\u010da]], in northern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], on 25 August 1878. He was the son of Halim-beg and Fatima Karabegovi\u0107 ({{nee|Mustajbegovi\u0107}}).{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} The Karabegovi\u0107 clan is believed to have originated from the village of [[Budim Do]], in western [[Herzegovina]]. At the beginning of the 18th century, four brothers from the clan left the village and migrated northward, settling in [[Zenica]], Biha\u0107, [[Mostar]] and Modri\u010da, respectively.{{sfn|Kamberovi\u0107|2003|p=389}} Karabegovi\u0107 personally believed that he was descended from the medieval [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], which ruled the [[Principality of Zeta]] in the 15th century.{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}}\n\nKarabegovi\u0107 completed his [[primary education]] in Modri\u010da, where he also attended [[maktab]]. He became a published writer at the age of seventeen. His first work, a poem titled ''Zec'' (Rabbit), was published in the periodical ''Br\u0161ljan'' (Ivy) in 1895. His second poem, ''Srpstvu'' (To Serbdom), was published in the periodical ''Bosanska vila'' (Bosnian Nymph) in 1896.{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} Karabegovi\u0107 adopted the letter ''[[S]].'' as his first initial, which stood for ''Srbin'' ([[Serbs|Serb]]). This was done, in part, to emphasize his self-identification as a Serb, but also to distinguish himself from his cousin [[Avdo Karabegovi\u0107 Hasanbegov]].{{sfn|Banac|1984|p=363}} Karabegovi\u0107 did not shy away from proselytizing and openly espousing his [[Serbophilia|Serbophile]] convictions, going so far as to secretly teach the [[Latin alphabet]] to Hasanbegov, who had been forbidden from receiving a [[Western education]] by his father. After Hasanbegov began publishing pro-Serb periodicals in the Latin alphabet, his home was attacked by a mob.{{sfn|Okey|2007|p=105}}\n\nKarabegovi\u0107 subsequently relocated to the town of [[Adapazar\u0131]], in [[Anatolia]], where he attended a [[vocational school]]. In 1896, he enrolled in a [[lyceum]] in [[Constantinople]]. In 1898, having completed three years of study, Karabegovi\u0107 dropped out and relocated to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]].{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} He settled in [[Belgrade]], which was then home to one of the world's largest [[Bosnian Muslim]] diasporas, second only to Constantinople.{{sfn|Okey|2007|p=105}} In 1899, the writer [[Janko Veselinovi\u0107 (writer)|Janko Veselinovi\u0107]]'s publication ''Zvezda'' printed a Serbian patriotic poem that Karabegovi\u0107 had written.{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} In 1900, Karabegovi\u0107 and fellow Muslim Serbophiles [[Osman \u0110iki\u0107]] and [[Omer-beg Sulejmanpa\u0161i\u0107]] printed a book of Serbian patriotic poetry.{{sfn|Okey|2007|p=105}}{{sfn|Hajdarpa\u0161i\u0107|2015|p=121}} Later that same year, after crossing the Austro-Hungarian border to visit [[Zemun]], Karabegovi\u0107 was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian authorities for [[draft evasion]]. He was subsequently taken to [[Budapest]], and as a Habsburg subject, compelled to serve three years in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. It was during this time that he contracted [[tuberculosis]], which would plague him for the rest of his life.{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}}\n\nAfter being discharged from the Austro-Hungarian Army, Karabegovi\u0107 enrolled in a teachers' college in [[Pakrac]].{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} Due to his pro-Serb and anti-Habsburg convictions, he was soon stripped of his Austrian citizenship.{{sfn|Selimovi\u0107 6 March 2019}} In 1903, Karabegovi\u0107 relocated to [[Aleksinac]], in central Serbia, where he attended teachers' college. He graduated from teachers' college in 1905.{{sfn|\u0160a\u0161i\u0107|1998|p=143}} The same year, the Royal Serbian Government hired Karabegovi\u0107 to teach Muslim schoolchildren the town of [[Mali Zvornik]], in western Serbia.{{sfn|Hajdarpa\u0161i\u0107|2015|loc=p. 241, note 144}} Later that year, Karabegovi\u0107 published his second poetry collection, titled simply ''Pjesme'' (Poems). By 1908, Karabegovi\u0107's tuberculosis had worsened substantially. He initially sought treatment in Belgrade before relocating to [[Ulcinj]] in the hope that the town's warm climate would ameliorate his symptoms, to no avail. On the advice of his doctors, Karabegovi\u0107 returned to Mali Zvornik.

He attended [[Sir Astley Cooper]]'s lectures on anatomy, and met in 1813 [[Joseph Henry Green]], a fellow apprentice and lifelong friend.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nSouth was admitted a member of the [[College of Surgeons of England]] on 6 Aug. 1819, six months before he had completed his indentures. He then acted for some months as prosector to the lecturers on anatomy at St. Thomas's Hospital, and on 14 December 1820 he was appointed conservator of the museum and assistant demonstrator of anatomy there for a term of three years. He was elected a joint demonstrator of anatomy with Bransby Cooper in February 1823, an election which gave rise to friction between Cooper and Green. He then was made lecturer on anatomy. Illness in 1841 led him to resign his lectureship, and he removed to [[Blackheath Park]], where he lived for the remainder of his life.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nSouth was elected a member of the council of the College of Surgeons on 3 March 1841, and on 28 July of the same year was appointed full surgeon to St. Thomas's Hospital, in place of [[Benjamin Travers]]; he resigned in April 1863. He was made surgeon to the Female Orphan Asylum in 1843, and on 27 September 1843 he was nominated one of the first fellows of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]. He acted as professor of human anatomy and surgery in the College for 1845, and he was [[Hunterian orator]] in 1844. His oration made no mention of [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]]; a history of medicine, it began early, and the time expired. He became a member of the court of examiners in 1849, president of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1851, and again in 1860. As a vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons he was instrumental in getting the body of Hunter interred in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 28 March 1859. He resigned his official connection with the college in 1873.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIn 1852 South went to Sweden, where he introduced the [[vegetable marrow]]. As a reward the Swedish Horticultural Society at Stockholm, at the instigation of his friend Retzius, awarded to its Linn\u00e6an medal of bronze. Recognised as a Latinist, he was selected to examine articled pupils in Latin before they were apprenticed to the Royal College of Surgeons of England.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nSouth died at Blackheath Park on 8 January 1882, and was buried in Charlton cemetery.

He was put to school in October 1805 with Samuel Hemming, D.D., at [[Hampton, Middlesex]], where he remained until June 1813.<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=South, John Flint|volume=53}}</ref>\n\nSouth began to attend the practice of [[St. Thomas's Hospital]] within a few weeks of leaving school, and on 18 February 1814 he was apprenticed to [[Henry Cline the younger]], then a surgeon there. He attended [[Sir Astley Cooper]]'s lectures on anatomy, and met in 1813 [[Joseph Henry Green]], a fellow apprentice and lifelong friend.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nSouth was admitted a member of the [[College of Surgeons of England]] on 6 Aug. 1819, six months before he had completed his indentures. He then acted for some months as prosector to the lecturers on anatomy at St. Thomas's Hospital, and on 14 December 1820 he was appointed conservator of the museum and assistant demonstrator of anatomy there for a term of three years. He was elected a joint demonstrator of anatomy with Bransby Cooper in February 1823, an election which gave rise to friction between Cooper and Green. He then was made lecturer on anatomy. Illness in 1841 led him to resign his lectureship, and he removed to [[Blackheath Park]], where he lived for the remainder of his life.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nSouth was elected a member of the council of the College of Surgeons on 3 March 1841, and on 28 July of the same year was appointed full surgeon to St. Thomas's Hospital, in place of [[Benjamin Travers]]; he resigned in April 1863. He was made surgeon to the Female Orphan Asylum in 1843, and on 27 September 1843 he was nominated one of the first fellows of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]. He acted as professor of human anatomy and surgery in the College for 1845, and he was [[Hunterian orator]] in 1844. His oration made no mention of [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]]; a history of medicine, it began early, and the time expired. He became a member of the court of examiners in 1849, president of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1851, and again in 1860. As a vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons he was instrumental in getting the body of Hunter interred in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 28 March 1859. He resigned his official connection with the college in 1873.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIn 1852 South went to Sweden, where he introduced the [[vegetable marrow]]. As a reward the Swedish Horticultural Society at Stockholm, at the instigation of his friend Retzius, awarded to its Linn\u00e6an medal of bronze. Recognised as a Latinist, he was selected to examine articled pupils in Latin before they were apprenticed to the Royal College of Surgeons of England.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nSouth died at Blackheath Park on 8 January 1882, and was buried in Charlton cemetery. He was religious, and threw himself into church work, especially with Sunday schools. In 1831 he was a prime mover in establishing the Surrey Zoological and Botanical Society.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Works==\n[[File:John Flint South Wellcome L0000076.jpg|thumb|John Flint South engraving]]\nBesides tracts on surgical and religious subjects and the articles on the \"Zoology of the Invertebrata\" in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana]]'', South wrote:<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n* ''A Short Description of the Bones'', 1825; 2nd edit.

He later told a negotiator he was \"out here right now\" because of the American-led interventions [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014\u2013present)|in Iraq]] and [[American-led intervention in Syria|in Syria]] and that the negotiator should tell the United States to stop the bombing.

Mateen was interviewed twice during the investigation, and had provided a written statement in which he confessed that he had previously lied to FBI investigators. During the investigation, the FBI had tracked his daily routine using unmarked vehicles, closely examined his phone records, and used two informants to secretly record his face-to-face conversations. The FBI Director said that they could have taken more initiative in gaining access to his social media accounts in 2013, but noted that back then such checks were not yet \"part of [their] investigative DNA\". However, it would not have mattered, as the analysis of Mateen's computer after the shooting showed that his social media accounts, including Facebook, had no ties to any terrorist groups, and that he did not post any \"radical statements\" until the early morning of the shooting. The FBI in 2013 also did not have the [[probable cause]] needed to obtain a search warrant in order to secretly listen to his phone calls or probe into Mateen's computer.<ref name=\"PastFBI2013\">{{cite news |last=Wilber |first=Del Quentin |date=July 14, 2016 |title=The FBI investigated the Orlando mass shooter for 10 months \u2014 and found nothing.

He later told a negotiator he was \"out here right now\" because of the American-led interventions [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014\u2013present)|in Iraq]] and [[American-led intervention in Syria|in Syria]] and that the negotiator should tell the United States to stop the bombing.

He was influenced by native Mexican cultures. Of his six symphonies, the second, or ''[[Sinfon\u00eda india]]'', which uses native [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] percussion instruments, is probably the most popular.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Conservatorio Nacional de M\u00fasica de M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|257px|left|National Conservatory of Music. M\u00e9xico City]]\nThe seventh child of a creole family, Ch\u00e1vez was born on Tacuba Avenue in Mexico City, near the suburb of Popotla {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=11}}. His paternal grandfather, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ch\u00e1vez Alonso]], served as governor of the state of [[Aguascalientes]] and was executed on the orders of Emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico|Maximilian]] in 1864. His father, August\u00edn Ch\u00e1vez, who died when Carlos was barely three years old, invented a [[plough]] that was produced and used in the [[United States]].{{harv|Parker|1998|loc=3}}.\n\nCarlos had his first piano lessons from his brother Manuel, and later on he was taught piano by Asunci\u00f3n Parra, [[Manuel Ponce]], and Pedro Luis Ozag\u00f3n, and harmony by Juan Fuentes. His family often holidayed in [[Tlaxcala]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Oaxaca]], and other places where the cultural influence of the Mexican indigenous peoples was still very strong {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn 1916, Ch\u00e1vez and friends started a cultural journal, ''Gladios'', and this led to his joining the staff of the Mexico City newspaper {{lang|es|[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]}} in 1924. In the succeeding 36 years he was to write over 500 items for this paper ({{harvnb|Parker|2001}}; {{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=230\u201336}}).\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the installation of a democratically elected president, [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]], Ch\u00e1vez became one of the first exponents of Mexican nationalist music with ballets on [[Aztec]] themes {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn September 1922, Ch\u00e1vez married Otilia Ortiz and they went on honeymoon to Europe, from October 1922 until April 1923, spending two weeks in [[Vienna]], five months in Berlin, and eight or ten days in Paris {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=25\u201326}}. During the latter visit he met [[Paul Dukas]] {{harv|Parker|2001}}. Some months later, in December 1923, Ch\u00e1vez visited the United States for the first time, returning in March 1924 {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=26}}. Ch\u00e1vez again went to New York City in September 1926 and stayed there until June 1928 {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=40}}. Upon his return to Mexico, Ch\u00e1vez became director of the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica Mexicana (Mexican Symphonic Orchestra), later renamed Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico (Mexico's Symphonic Orchestra); the country's first permanent orchestra, started by a musicians' [[labor union]]. Ch\u00e1vez was instrumental in taking the orchestra on tour through Mexico's rural areas.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nIn December 1928, Ch\u00e1vez was appointed director of Mexico's National Conservatory of Music\u2014a position he held for a total of five years (until March 1933, and again for eight months in 1934). In that capacity, Ch\u00e1vez spearheaded three ''academias de investigaci\u00f3n'', two concerned with collecting and cataloguing indigenous music and its literature, and the third to study the uses of old and new scales {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn 1937, Ch\u00e1vez published a book, ''Toward a New Music'', which is one of the first books in which a composer speaks about [[electronic music]]. In 1938, he conducted a series of concerts with the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], during a period of absence by the orchestra's regular conductor, [[Arturo Toscanini]]. In 1940 he produced concerts at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], and by 1945, Ch\u00e1vez had come to be regarded as the foremost Mexican composer and conductor {{harv|Slonimsky|1945|loc=230\u201331}}.\n\nFrom January 1947 until 1952, Ch\u00e1vez served as director-general of the [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes|National Institute of Fine Arts]]. In his first year, he formed the [[National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico)|National Symphony Orchestra]], which supplanted the older OSM as Mexico's premier orchestra and led to the disbanding of the older ensemble. Throughout all this time, Ch\u00e1vez maintained a busy international touring schedule {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n[[File:CarlosChaveztombDoloresDF.JPG|thumb|200px|Carlos Ch\u00e1vez's tomb in the [[Pante\u00f3n de Dolores]], Mexico City]]\n\nIn May 1953 he was commissioned by [[Lincoln Kirstein]], director of the New York City center of Music and Drama, for a three-act opera to a libretto by [[Chester Kallman]] based on a story by [[Boccaccio]], to be titled ''The Tuscan Players''. Intended to be finished in August 1954, it was first postponed to April 1955, but only finally completed in 1956, by which time the title had been changed twice, first to ''P\u00e1nfilo and Lauretta'', then to {{lang|es|El amor propiciado}}. The City Center waived its rights to the first performance, which was given under the title ''Panfilo and Lauretta'' in the Brander Matthews Theatre at [[Columbia University]] in New York on May 9, 1957, under the baton of [[Howard Shanet]]. Stage direction was by Bill Butler, scenic design by Herbert Senn and Helen Pond, and costumes by Sylvia Wintle. The principal singers were [[Sylvia Stahlman]], Frank Porretta, [[Craig Timberlake]], Mary McMurray, Michael Kermoyan, and [[Thomas Stewart (bass-baritone)|Thomas Stewart]] {{harv|Taubman|1957}}. The opera would be revised twice more and the title changed again to {{lang|es|Los visitantes}} (''[[The Visitors (opera)|The Visitors]]''), for productions in 1968 and 1973, in Mexico City and [[Aptos, California]], respectively ({{harvnb|Parker|2001}}; {{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=171}}). From 1958\u20131959 he was the Charles Eliot Norton professor at [[Harvard University]], and the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|public lectures]] he gave there were published as a book, ''Musical Thought'' {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961}}.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973, Carlos Ch\u00e1vez served as the music director of the [[Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music]]. His orchestral composition ''Discovery'' (1969) had previously been commission by the Festival and was first performed there.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nFailing health and financial setbacks forced Ch\u00e1vez to sell his house{{when|date=June 2012}} in the [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] neighborhood of Mexico City and move in with his daughter Anita in [[Coyoac\u00e1n]], in the fringes of the Mexican capital, where he died quietly on 2 August 1978 {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nCarlos Ch\u00e1vez's manuscripts and papers are housed in the Music Division of the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]] and in the [[General National Archive (Mexico)|National Archive of Mexico]], in Mexico City.\n\n==Musical style==\nCh\u00e1vez's music does not fall into clear stylistic periods, but rather cumulates elements in a process of continual synthesis. The [[juvenilia]], up to 1921 and consisting primarily of piano compositions, is essentially [[Romantic music|Romantic]], with [[Robert Schumann]] as the main influence. A period of nationalistic leanings was initiated in 1921 with the [[Aztec]]-themed ballet {{lang|es|El fuego nuevo}} (The New Fire), followed by a second ballet, {{lang|es|Los cuatro soles}} (The Four Suns), in 1925 {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nDuring his time in New York City between 1924 and 1928, Ch\u00e1vez acquired a taste for the then-fashionable abstract and quasi-scientific music, as is reflected in the titles of many of his compositions written between 1923 and 1934: {{lang|es|Pol\u00edgonos}} for piano (Polygons, 1923), {{lang|es|Ex\u00e1gonos}} for voice and piano (Hexagons, 1924), ''36'' for piano (1925), {{lang|es|Energ\u00eda}} for nine instruments (Energy, 1925), {{lang|es|Espiral}} for violin and piano (Spiral, 1934), and an unfinished orchestral score titled {{lang|es|Pir\u00e1mides}} (Pyramids).\n\nThe culmination of this period was the ballet ''[[Caballos de vapor|H. P.]]'' (i.e., Horse Power), also known by the Spanish title {{lang|es|Caballos de vapor}} (1926\u201331) {{harv|Slonimsky|1945|loc=231}}. ''H. P.'' is a colorfully orchestrated score of ample dimensions and dense, compact atmosphere, notable for its dynamism and vitality, revealing the influence of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and at the same time returning to folkloric and popular elements, with dances such as the [[sandunga]], [[tango (dance)|tango]], [[huapango]], and [[foxtrot]] {{harv|Garcia_Morillo|1960|loc=49\u201351}}. Such nationalisms would appear through the 1930s, notably in the Second Symphony (the {{lang|es|Sinfon\u00eda \u00edndia}} of 1935\u201336, one of the few works by Ch\u00e1vez to quote actual Native-American themes), but only sporadically in later compositions {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nAlthough this early period saw the creation of the Sonatina for violin and piano (1924), it was only in the 1930s that Ch\u00e1vez returned to another of the main musical interests of his maturity, prefigured in the juvenilia: the traditional genres of the [[sonata]], [[String quartet|quartet]], [[symphony]], and [[concerto]] {{harv|Parker|2001}}. He composed six numbered symphonies. The first, titled {{lang|es|[[Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona]]}} (1933), was reworked from incidental music for [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''Antigone'', an adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' tragedy. In it, Ch\u00e1vez sought to create an archaic ambiance through the use of modal polyphony, harmonies built on fourths and fifths, and a predominant use of wind instruments {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn the fourth of his Norton lectures of 1958\u201359, titled \"Repetition in Music\" {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961|loc=55\u201384}}, he described a mode of composition already observable in many of his compositions since the 1920s, in which \"The idea of repetition and variation can be replaced by the notion of constant rebirth, of true derivation: a stream that never comes back to its source; a stream in eternal development, like a spiral&nbsp;\u2026\" {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961|loc=84}}. A notable early example of this method is ''Soli I'' (1933), the first work acknowledged by the composer to have been consciously organized according to this principle. It only became a regular feature, however, beginning with ''Invenci\u00f3n I'' for piano (1958), and subsequently in most of his instrumental compositions of the 1960s and 1970s: ''Invenci\u00f3n II'' for string trio (1965), ''Invenci\u00f3n III'' for harp (1967), ''Soli II'' for wind quintet (1961), ''Soli III'' for bassoon, trumpet, viola, timpani, and orchestra (1969), ''Soli IV'' for brass trio (1966), ''Cinco Caprichos'' for piano (1975), and the late orchestral works ''Resonancias'' (1964), ''Elatio'' (1967), ''Discovery'' (1969), ''Clio'' (1969), and ''Initium'' (1970\u201372) {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=41, 47, 98\u2013103, 123\u201324}}.\n\n==Recordings==\n\nCh\u00e1vez made more than a handful of recordings, conducting his own music as well as that of other composers. One of the earliest was made in the 1930s for Victor, containing Ch\u00e1vez's ''Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona'' and ''Sinfon\u00eda india'', together with his orchestration of [[Dietrich Buxtehude]]'s Chaconne in E minor: 4-disc 78-rpm set, Victor Musical Masterpiece Series, Victor Red Seal M 503 (manual sequence) and DM 503 (automatic sequence). The best-known{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} of his discs was the [[Everest Records]] stereophonic recording of his ''Sinfon\u00eda India'', ''Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona'', and ''Sinfon\u00eda Rom\u00e1ntica'', in which Ch\u00e1vez conducted the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra|Stadium Symphony Orchestra]], the name given to the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] for its summer performances in the [[Lewisohn Stadium]]. The album was originally issued in 1959 by [[Everest Records]] on LP SDBR 3029, and was reissued on CD in 1996 by Everest as EVC-9041, as well as at some point by [[Philips Records]]. In 1963 Ch\u00e1vez conducted the [[Vienna State Opera|Vienna State Opera Orchestra]] in two recordings with pianist [[Eugene List]] for [[Westminster Records]], both released on LP: one of his own Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (Westminster WST 17030, reissued in 1976 as Westminster Gold WGS 8324) and one of the two piano concertos by [[Edward Macdowell]] (ABC Westminster Gold WGS 8156). In the 1950s he released two recordings on US Decca records, on which he conducted the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico. In 1951 a 10-inch mono LP was issued (Decca Gold Label DL 7512, reissued 1978 by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] on side 2 of 12-inch LP ), containing his Suite from ''[[La hija de C\u00f3lquide]]'' (originally recorded in 1947 for the Mexican label Anfi\u00f3n and issued as a 3-disc 78 rpm set Anfi\u00f3n AM 4), and in 1956 they released an anthology, ''Music of Mexico'', on which he conducted three of his own works, plus [[Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo]]'s ''Huapango'' (Decca Gold Label LP, DL9527). He also made some recordings for [[Columbia Records]] which were issued on 78-rpm discs and on LP (Columbia 4-disc 78-rpm set M 414, reissued 1949 on Columbia 10-inch LP, Columbia ML 2080 and Mexican Columbia DCL 98, reissued on Columbia 12-inch LP, LL 1015; CBS Masterworks 3-LP set 32 31 0001 (mono)/ 32 31 002 (stereo); CBC Masterworks LP 32 11 0064; Columbia LP M32685; Odyssey LP Y 31534). In 1961 he recorded [[Sergey Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', with the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico and [[Carlos Pellicer]], narrator, released on Mexican CBS MC 1360.\n\n== List of works ==\n{{main|List of compositions by Carlos Ch\u00e1vez}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Daniel Ayala P\u00e9rez]]\n* [[Aaron Copland]]\n* [[Blas Galindo]]\n* [[Grupo de los cuatro]]\n* [[Silvestre Revueltas]]\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Ch\u00e1vez|1937}}|reference=Ch\u00e1vez, Carlos. 1937.

He was influenced by native Mexican cultures. Of his six symphonies, the second, or ''[[Sinfon\u00eda india]]'', which uses native [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] percussion instruments, is probably the most popular.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Conservatorio Nacional de M\u00fasica de M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|257px|left|National Conservatory of Music. M\u00e9xico City]]\nThe seventh child of a creole family, Ch\u00e1vez was born on Tacuba Avenue in Mexico City, near the suburb of Popotla {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=11}}. His paternal grandfather, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ch\u00e1vez Alonso]], served as governor of the state of [[Aguascalientes]] and was executed on the orders of Emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico|Maximilian]] in 1864. His father, August\u00edn Ch\u00e1vez, who died when Carlos was barely three years old, invented a [[plough]] that was produced and used in the [[United States]].{{harv|Parker|1998|loc=3}}.\n\nCarlos had his first piano lessons from his brother Manuel, and later on he was taught piano by Asunci\u00f3n Parra, [[Manuel Ponce]], and Pedro Luis Ozag\u00f3n, and harmony by Juan Fuentes. His family often holidayed in [[Tlaxcala]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Oaxaca]], and other places where the cultural influence of the Mexican indigenous peoples was still very strong {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn 1916, Ch\u00e1vez and friends started a cultural journal, ''Gladios'', and this led to his joining the staff of the Mexico City newspaper {{lang|es|[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]}} in 1924. In the succeeding 36 years he was to write over 500 items for this paper ({{harvnb|Parker|2001}}; {{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=230\u201336}}).\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the installation of a democratically elected president, [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]], Ch\u00e1vez became one of the first exponents of Mexican nationalist music with ballets on [[Aztec]] themes {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn September 1922, Ch\u00e1vez married Otilia Ortiz and they went on honeymoon to Europe, from October 1922 until April 1923, spending two weeks in [[Vienna]], five months in Berlin, and eight or ten days in Paris {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=25\u201326}}. During the latter visit he met [[Paul Dukas]] {{harv|Parker|2001}}. Some months later, in December 1923, Ch\u00e1vez visited the United States for the first time, returning in March 1924 {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=26}}. Ch\u00e1vez again went to New York City in September 1926 and stayed there until June 1928 {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=40}}. Upon his return to Mexico, Ch\u00e1vez became director of the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica Mexicana (Mexican Symphonic Orchestra), later renamed Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico (Mexico's Symphonic Orchestra); the country's first permanent orchestra, started by a musicians' [[labor union]]. Ch\u00e1vez was instrumental in taking the orchestra on tour through Mexico's rural areas.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nIn December 1928, Ch\u00e1vez was appointed director of Mexico's National Conservatory of Music\u2014a position he held for a total of five years (until March 1933, and again for eight months in 1934). In that capacity, Ch\u00e1vez spearheaded three ''academias de investigaci\u00f3n'', two concerned with collecting and cataloguing indigenous music and its literature, and the third to study the uses of old and new scales {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn 1937, Ch\u00e1vez published a book, ''Toward a New Music'', which is one of the first books in which a composer speaks about [[electronic music]]. In 1938, he conducted a series of concerts with the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], during a period of absence by the orchestra's regular conductor, [[Arturo Toscanini]]. In 1940 he produced concerts at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], and by 1945, Ch\u00e1vez had come to be regarded as the foremost Mexican composer and conductor {{harv|Slonimsky|1945|loc=230\u201331}}.\n\nFrom January 1947 until 1952, Ch\u00e1vez served as director-general of the [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes|National Institute of Fine Arts]]. In his first year, he formed the [[National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico)|National Symphony Orchestra]], which supplanted the older OSM as Mexico's premier orchestra and led to the disbanding of the older ensemble. Throughout all this time, Ch\u00e1vez maintained a busy international touring schedule {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n[[File:CarlosChaveztombDoloresDF.JPG|thumb|200px|Carlos Ch\u00e1vez's tomb in the [[Pante\u00f3n de Dolores]], Mexico City]]\n\nIn May 1953 he was commissioned by [[Lincoln Kirstein]], director of the New York City center of Music and Drama, for a three-act opera to a libretto by [[Chester Kallman]] based on a story by [[Boccaccio]], to be titled ''The Tuscan Players''. Intended to be finished in August 1954, it was first postponed to April 1955, but only finally completed in 1956, by which time the title had been changed twice, first to ''P\u00e1nfilo and Lauretta'', then to {{lang|es|El amor propiciado}}. The City Center waived its rights to the first performance, which was given under the title ''Panfilo and Lauretta'' in the Brander Matthews Theatre at [[Columbia University]] in New York on May 9, 1957, under the baton of [[Howard Shanet]]. Stage direction was by Bill Butler, scenic design by Herbert Senn and Helen Pond, and costumes by Sylvia Wintle. The principal singers were [[Sylvia Stahlman]], Frank Porretta, [[Craig Timberlake]], Mary McMurray, Michael Kermoyan, and [[Thomas Stewart (bass-baritone)|Thomas Stewart]] {{harv|Taubman|1957}}. The opera would be revised twice more and the title changed again to {{lang|es|Los visitantes}} (''[[The Visitors (opera)|The Visitors]]''), for productions in 1968 and 1973, in Mexico City and [[Aptos, California]], respectively ({{harvnb|Parker|2001}}; {{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=171}}). From 1958\u20131959 he was the Charles Eliot Norton professor at [[Harvard University]], and the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|public lectures]] he gave there were published as a book, ''Musical Thought'' {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961}}.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973, Carlos Ch\u00e1vez served as the music director of the [[Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music]].

One of the earliest was made in the 1930s for Victor, containing Ch\u00e1vez's ''Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona'' and ''Sinfon\u00eda india'', together with his orchestration of [[Dietrich Buxtehude]]'s Chaconne in E minor: 4-disc 78-rpm set, Victor Musical Masterpiece Series, Victor Red Seal M 503 (manual sequence) and DM 503 (automatic sequence). The best-known{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} of his discs was the [[Everest Records]] stereophonic recording of his ''Sinfon\u00eda India'', ''Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona'', and ''Sinfon\u00eda Rom\u00e1ntica'', in which Ch\u00e1vez conducted the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra|Stadium Symphony Orchestra]], the name given to the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] for its summer performances in the [[Lewisohn Stadium]]. The album was originally issued in 1959 by [[Everest Records]] on LP SDBR 3029, and was reissued on CD in 1996 by Everest as EVC-9041, as well as at some point by [[Philips Records]]. In 1963 Ch\u00e1vez conducted the [[Vienna State Opera|Vienna State Opera Orchestra]] in two recordings with pianist [[Eugene List]] for [[Westminster Records]], both released on LP: one of his own Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (Westminster WST 17030, reissued in 1976 as Westminster Gold WGS 8324) and one of the two piano concertos by [[Edward Macdowell]] (ABC Westminster Gold WGS 8156). In the 1950s he released two recordings on US Decca records, on which he conducted the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico. In 1951 a 10-inch mono LP was issued (Decca Gold Label DL 7512, reissued 1978 by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] on side 2 of 12-inch LP ), containing his Suite from ''[[La hija de C\u00f3lquide]]'' (originally recorded in 1947 for the Mexican label Anfi\u00f3n and issued as a 3-disc 78 rpm set Anfi\u00f3n AM 4), and in 1956 they released an anthology, ''Music of Mexico'', on which he conducted three of his own works, plus [[Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo]]'s ''Huapango'' (Decca Gold Label LP, DL9527). He also made some recordings for [[Columbia Records]] which were issued on 78-rpm discs and on LP (Columbia 4-disc 78-rpm set M 414, reissued 1949 on Columbia 10-inch LP, Columbia ML 2080 and Mexican Columbia DCL 98, reissued on Columbia 12-inch LP, LL 1015; CBS Masterworks 3-LP set 32 31 0001 (mono)/ 32 31 002 (stereo); CBC Masterworks LP 32 11 0064; Columbia LP M32685; Odyssey LP Y 31534). In 1961 he recorded [[Sergey Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', with the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico and [[Carlos Pellicer]], narrator, released on Mexican CBS MC 1360.\n\n== List of works ==\n{{main|List of compositions by Carlos Ch\u00e1vez}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Daniel Ayala P\u00e9rez]]\n* [[Aaron Copland]]\n* [[Blas Galindo]]\n* [[Grupo de los cuatro]]\n* [[Silvestre Revueltas]]\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Ch\u00e1vez|1937}}|reference=Ch\u00e1vez, Carlos. 1937.
