The image of the [[Saint Sofia Church, Sofia|Church of St. Sophia]] which gave the name to the city takes up the upper left quarter (as seen from behind the shield) and a humanized picture of the ancient town of [[Serdica]] taken from an antique coin is located to the right (again, heraldry [[dexter and sinister|reverses right and left]] as it is from the point of view of someone holding the shield from behind). At lower left is a golden [[baldachin]] and a statue of [[Apollo Medicus]] representing the [[mineral spring]]s around the city, while the lower right quarter is reserved for [[Vitosha]], the mountain at the foot of which Sofia is located. \n\nIn the middle is another, smaller shield ([[inescutcheon]]), with a lion rampant, a traditional [[Bulgaria]]n symbol. A [[mural crown]] tops the larger shield.

The then-[[List of Bulgarian monarchs|Knyaz]] [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand]] approved the coat of arms and it was sent to Paris.\n\nChanges were made to the original image of the coat of arms in the following years. The motto was first added in 1911 by Haralampi Tachev, who also gave it a final touch by adding a band with the motto and [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] twigs in 1928. A simplified version was suggested by Boris Angelushev in the 1940s, with Ivan Radoev adding a five-pointed star and additionally stylizing the coat of arms in 1974.

The then-[[List of Bulgarian monarchs|Knyaz]] [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand]] approved the coat of arms and it was sent to Paris.\n\nChanges were made to the original image of the coat of arms in the following years.

They remained in that order of votes after all other candidates were eliminated and their votes re-allocated. When Kaplan was then eliminated, Quan picked up 18,864 votes from Kaplan backers while Perata was the next choice of only 6,407 Kaplan backers. As a result, Quan won a final round majority when matched against Perata, which means she was ranked ahead of Perata on a majority of ballots in which one of them received a ranking.(11% of voters did not rank either of them, making their votes exhausted by the time of the final round.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acgov.org/rov/rcv/results/rcvresults_2984.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 11, 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115182601/http://www.acgov.org/rov/rcv/results/rcvresults_2984.htm |archivedate=November 15, 2011 }}</ref>\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Candidate\n!colspan=3|Round 1\n!rowspan=2|\u2026\n!colspan=3|Round 9\n!colspan=2|Round 10\n|-\n!Votes||%<sup>(*)</sup>||Transfer||Votes||%<sup>(*)</sup>||Transfer||Votes||%<sup>(*)</sup>\n|-\n|[[Don Perata]]||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''40,342'''</span>||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''33.73%'''</span>||+32||||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''45,465'''</span>||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''40.16%'''</span>||+6,407||51,872||49.04%\n|-\n|'''[[Jean Quan]]'''||29,266||24.47%||+33||||35,033||30.94%||+18,864||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''53,897'''</span>||<span style=\"color:red;\">'''50.96%'''</span>\n|-\n|[[Rebecca Kaplan]]||25,813||21.58%||+18||||32,719||28.90%||-32,719||||\n|-\n|Joe Tuman||14,347||12.00%||+10||||||||||||\n|-\n|Marcie Hodge||2,994||2.50%||+5||||||||||||\n|-\n|Terence Candell||2,315||1.94%||+1||||||||||||\n|-\n|Don MacLeay||1,630||1.36%||+6||||||||||||\n|-\n|Greg Harland||966||0.81%||+2||||||||||||\n|-\n|Larry Lionel ''LL'' Young Jr.||933||0.78%||+6||||||||||||\n|-\n|Arnold Fields||733||0.61%||+5||||||||||||\n|-\n|Write-In||268||0.22%||-268||||||||||||\n|-\n|Continuing Ballots||119,607||100.00%||||||113,217||100.00%||||105,769||100.00%\n|-\n|Exhausted Ballots||0||||+149||||6,284||||+7,383||13,667|||\n|-\n|Overvotes||355||||+1||||461||||+65||526|||\n|-\n|Undervotes||2,306||||||||2,306||||||2,306|||\n|-\n|Total Ballots||122,268||||||||122,268||||||122,268|||\n|}\n\n=====2012 elections=====\nOakland used RCV for several elections in 2012, including a citywide election for city attorney and for several seats on the city council and school board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zennie62blog.com/2012/06/07/oakland-city-council-will-change-oaklanders-get-to-decide-how-dan-cohen-48125/ |title=Oakland City Council Will Change; Oaklanders Get To Decide How \u2013 Dan Cohen |website=Zennie62blog.com |date=2012-06-07 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}</ref> Several races were decided after multiple rounds, including the District 3 city council race where the winner trailed in first choices.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mollie |last=Hailey  |url=http://www.fairvote.org/fairvote-s-first-take-on-rcv-elections-in-four-bay-area-cities |title=FairVote's First Take on RCV Elections in Four Bay Area Cities |work=FairVote.org  |date=2012-11-12 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}</ref> Of the 18 Oakland offices elected by RCV in 2010 and 2012, sixteen of the RCV winners received more votes than the previous winner had won before adoption in the last non-RCV election <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fairvote.org/assets/Oakland-RCV-Analysis-2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-06 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130106162800/http://www.fairvote.org/assets/Oakland-RCV-Analysis-2012.pdf |archive-date=2013-01-06 |url-status = bot: unknown}}</ref>\n\n====San Francisco====\n[[San Francisco]] has used RCV for its Board of Supervisors and most citywide offices nearly every November since 2004.

The winner won 54% of the final round count, which amounted to 48.67% of the total first-round votes, with 9.89% of the ballots exhausted by the final round.\n* District 5: There were 22 candidates, reduced to 3 in 19 rounds, when the winner had a majority of active ballots. The winner finished with 50.6% of the final round vote against two runners up, which amounted to 37.63% of the first-round vote with 25.63% of the ballots exhausted.\n* District 7: There were 13 candidates, reduced to 2 in 11 rounds. The winner finished with 57% of the votes cast for the two active candidates in the final round. Of first round votes, this amounted to 43.72% of the first-round vote, with 23.12% exhausted ballots.\n* District 11: There were 8 candidates, reduced to 2 in 6 rounds. The winner finished with 58% of the final round vote, which amounted to 46.08% of the total first-round vote, with 21.01% of the ballots exhausted.\n\nThe District 5 results are included below as the largest election from 2004 and the one with the most rounds of counting. The elimination table shows the candidates reordered by their elimination. The elimination process was stable for the highest 5 candidates, holding their same plurality ranking each round despite the 19 rounds of elimination and transfer votes.\n\nThe RCV elimination process was halted when candidate Mirkarimi reached more than 50% of the active ballots, but only 37.6% of the total first-round ballots.
