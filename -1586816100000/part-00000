The current bridge is the second bridge located in Hay that crosses the Murrumbidgee; the first bridge was in operation from 1873 until 1973; the second and current bridge has operated since 1973.\n\n== Current bridge ==\nThe current Hay Bridge is a six-[[Span (architecture)|span]], [[reinforced concrete]] and steel [[box girder]] structure supported on steel piles and slender concrete piers. It has an overall length of {{convert|638|ft|m|0|order=flip}} with two {{convert|97|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} spans and four {{convert|105|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} spans, and is {{convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}} between kerbs. A {{convert|5|ft|m|0|adj=mid|order=flip|spell=on|-wide}} [[footway]] has been provided for pedestrian use.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\nEach box girder is made up of five cells each {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} wide and {{convert|3|ft|3|in|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} high. The base and walls of each cell are steel plates and the reinforced concrete deck forms the top section. A feature of the design is the cantilever construction of the girders. This allows a greater distance between piers than a simply supported span design.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\nHay is located on the Western Plains where the clay and silt deposit can be up to {{convert|1500|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in depth. Due to the complete absence of rock in this deposit, {{convert|10|x|10|in|cm|0|order=flip}} in rolled \"H\" section steel piles have been used for the [[Foundation (construction)|foundations]]. These vary from {{convert|51|to|81|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in length.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\n[[Coffer dam]]s of steel sheet piling were constructed in the river to enable the construction of the two pile caps and the lower portions of the two piers in the river. The steel girders were manufactured at Sydney in pairs {{convert|15|ft|m|0|order=flip}} wide, transported by road to Hay and bolted together after having been placed in position on falsework.

The current bridge is the second bridge located in Hay that crosses the Murrumbidgee; the first bridge was in operation from 1873 until 1973; the second and current bridge has operated since 1973.\n\n== Current bridge ==\nThe current Hay Bridge is a six-[[Span (architecture)|span]], [[reinforced concrete]] and steel [[box girder]] structure supported on steel piles and slender concrete piers. It has an overall length of {{convert|638|ft|m|0|order=flip}} with two {{convert|97|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} spans and four {{convert|105|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} spans, and is {{convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}} between kerbs. A {{convert|5|ft|m|0|adj=mid|order=flip|spell=on|-wide}} [[footway]] has been provided for pedestrian use.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\nEach box girder is made up of five cells each {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} wide and {{convert|3|ft|3|in|m|0|order=flip|spell=on}} high. The base and walls of each cell are steel plates and the reinforced concrete deck forms the top section. A feature of the design is the cantilever construction of the girders. This allows a greater distance between piers than a simply supported span design.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\nHay is located on the Western Plains where the clay and silt deposit can be up to {{convert|1500|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in depth. Due to the complete absence of rock in this deposit, {{convert|10|x|10|in|cm|0|order=flip}} in rolled \"H\" section steel piles have been used for the [[Foundation (construction)|foundations]]. These vary from {{convert|51|to|81|ft|m|0|order=flip}} in length.<ref name=\"Main Roads\"/>\n\n[[Coffer dam]]s of steel sheet piling were constructed in the river to enable the construction of the two pile caps and the lower portions of the two piers in the river. The steel girders were manufactured at Sydney in pairs {{convert|15|ft|m|0|order=flip}} wide, transported by road to Hay and bolted together after having been placed in position on falsework.

The current party originated in 2009 with the merger of the [[Lakas\u2013CMD (1991)|original Lakas\u2013CMD]] party with the [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI); it was known as '''Lakas\u2013Kampi\u2013CMD''' until 2012. The party produced one president, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], who was president when the two parties merged in 2009.\n\nWith Arroyo unable to run for a new term due to term limits, the party lost the [[2010 Philippine presidential election|2010 presidential election]] with [[Gilberto Teodoro]] as its presidential nominee. The party retained its two [[Philippine Senate|senators]], both incumbents, in the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|Senate election]] and became a part of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]-led majority coalition; in the [[2010 Philippine House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives election]], it won 47% of the seats contested in the district election, but most of its members were split into three groups, with many defecting to the Liberal Party, some formed the [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]], and the remaining members were split into the majority and minority blocs, with its members heading the minority. On May 11, 2012, the party decided to revert to its original name and drop Arroyo's KAMPI from the coalition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/22728-lakas-drops-gmas-kampi-from-coalition |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514081052/http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/22728-lakas-drops-gmas-kampi-from-coalition |archivedate=2012-05-14 }} The Manila Times: Lakas drops GMA's Kampi from coalition</ref> Lakas\u2013CMD is currently one of the parties in opposition.

It is known for its advocacy of a shift from the present [[presidential system]] to a parliamentary form of government through constitutional amendments and through establishing peace talks with [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]] separatists and [[communism|communist]] rebels.

Ramos, co-founder of Lakas NUCD.]]\nLakas ng Tao was formed in December 1991 for the [[1992 Philippine general election|1992 elections]] as retired General, then-Defense Secretary, [[Fidel V. Ramos]] and former [[Cebu]] Governor [[Emilio Mario Osme\u00f1a|Emilio Mario \"Lito\" R. Osme\u00f1a]] were running for president and vice-president respectively. It was also formed when Ramos bolted from the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP; Struggle of Democratic Filipinos), after he had lost in the bid for the presidency under that said banner to Speaker [[Ramon Mitra]].\n\nThe party was formed out of two parties: Ramos's Partido Lakas ng Tao (People Power Party) and the National Union of Christian Democrats of [[Raul Manglapus]].  As they coalesced, the party became known as Lakas ng Tao-[[Lakas\u2013CMD (1991)|National Union of Christian Democrats]], with Lakas ng Tao usually just shortened to \"Lakas\" and abbreviated as Lakas-NUCD.\n\nIn 1994, it formed a coalition government with the LDP for the [[1995 Philippine general election|1995 legislative elections]].  This coalition, dubbed the \"[[Lakas-Laban Coalition]]\", won a majority in both Houses of Congress. In the 1997 Lakas National Convention, the party nominated House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] of [[Pangasinan]] after a close nominal fight with then Defense Secretary [[Renato de Villa]] as its nominee to the presidency against the opposition's Vice President [[Joseph Estrada]] in the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  By this time, it was joined by the Union of Muslim Democrats of the Philippines of former ambassador to Egypt and Oman [[Sanchez Ali|Sanchez A. Ali]] to form Lakas ng EDSA-National Union of Christian Democrats-United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines.\n\nSecretary de Villa eventually bolted the party and formed [[Partido ng Demokratikong Reporma]] (Democratic Reform Party) for the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  Lakas also nominated then-Senator [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] of [[Pampanga]] as its candidate as [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]]. Arroyo had originally intended to run for president under her party, [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino|Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI). De Venecia lost to Vice President Estrada by a significant plurality, while Arroyo won the vice presidency in the same manner while her KAMPI party was in hiatus.\n\n===Arroyo administration===\nIn the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 elections]], the name changed again to the current Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats, or Lakas\u2013CMD.  However, the meaning of Lakas in the party name is usually now referred to as \"Lakas ng [[EDSA I|EDSA]]\" which means \"The Strength of EDSA\" than the original Lakas ng Tao which means \"The Strength of the People\" or \"People Power.\"  This is also the name that it used when it ran in 2004 elections under the K-4 coalition.  President Arroyo, who succeeded the deposed President [[Joseph Estrada]], was the K-4 Coalition candidate for president in the 2004 election, eventually winning over her opponents primarily [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]] and Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]].<ref name= \"Centre-right\" />\n\nAt the onset of 2006, Lakas\u2013CMD was torn by factional rivalry between supporters of President Arroyo and supporters of former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]].  Issues include transitory provisions in a proposed Constitution to scrap mid-term elections (or \"no-el\") set for 2007 and calls for her to step down in time for the elections, which is related to the \"no-el\" controversy. The party held its Annual Party Directorate Meeting on January 14, 2006 to discuss these matters.\n\nThere are no official results available of the 2007 [[elections in the Philippines|elections]] released by the party but according to the [[Philippine House of Representatives]], the party holds 79 out of 235 seats.\n\nOn January 16, 2008, Lakas spokesman and legal counsel [[Raul Lambino]] stated that Lakas\u2013CMD officially released the list of senatorial bets for 2010\u2014spokesman  in 2010. Except for Para\u00f1aque Representative Eduardo Zialcita, they were not yet identified.

Ramos, co-founder of Lakas NUCD.]]\nLakas ng Tao was formed in December 1991 for the [[1992 Philippine general election|1992 elections]] as retired General, then-Defense Secretary, [[Fidel V. Ramos]] and former [[Cebu]] Governor [[Emilio Mario Osme\u00f1a|Emilio Mario \"Lito\" R. Osme\u00f1a]] were running for president and vice-president respectively. It was also formed when Ramos bolted from the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP; Struggle of Democratic Filipinos), after he had lost in the bid for the presidency under that said banner to Speaker [[Ramon Mitra]].\n\nThe party was formed out of two parties: Ramos's Partido Lakas ng Tao (People Power Party) and the National Union of Christian Democrats of [[Raul Manglapus]].  As they coalesced, the party became known as Lakas ng Tao-[[Lakas\u2013CMD (1991)|National Union of Christian Democrats]], with Lakas ng Tao usually just shortened to \"Lakas\" and abbreviated as Lakas-NUCD.\n\nIn 1994, it formed a coalition government with the LDP for the [[1995 Philippine general election|1995 legislative elections]].  This coalition, dubbed the \"[[Lakas-Laban Coalition]]\", won a majority in both Houses of Congress. In the 1997 Lakas National Convention, the party nominated House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] of [[Pangasinan]] after a close nominal fight with then Defense Secretary [[Renato de Villa]] as its nominee to the presidency against the opposition's Vice President [[Joseph Estrada]] in the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  By this time, it was joined by the Union of Muslim Democrats of the Philippines of former ambassador to Egypt and Oman [[Sanchez Ali|Sanchez A. Ali]] to form Lakas ng EDSA-National Union of Christian Democrats-United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines.\n\nSecretary de Villa eventually bolted the party and formed [[Partido ng Demokratikong Reporma]] (Democratic Reform Party) for the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  Lakas also nominated then-Senator [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] of [[Pampanga]] as its candidate as [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]]. Arroyo had originally intended to run for president under her party, [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino|Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI). De Venecia lost to Vice President Estrada by a significant plurality, while Arroyo won the vice presidency in the same manner while her KAMPI party was in hiatus.\n\n===Arroyo administration===\nIn the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 elections]], the name changed again to the current Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats, or Lakas\u2013CMD.  However, the meaning of Lakas in the party name is usually now referred to as \"Lakas ng [[EDSA I|EDSA]]\" which means \"The Strength of EDSA\" than the original Lakas ng Tao which means \"The Strength of the People\" or \"People Power.\"  This is also the name that it used when it ran in 2004 elections under the K-4 coalition.  President Arroyo, who succeeded the deposed President [[Joseph Estrada]], was the K-4 Coalition candidate for president in the 2004 election, eventually winning over her opponents primarily [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]] and Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]].<ref name= \"Centre-right\" />\n\nAt the onset of 2006, Lakas\u2013CMD was torn by factional rivalry between supporters of President Arroyo and supporters of former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]].  Issues include transitory provisions in a proposed Constitution to scrap mid-term elections (or \"no-el\") set for 2007 and calls for her to step down in time for the elections, which is related to the \"no-el\" controversy. The party held its Annual Party Directorate Meeting on January 14, 2006 to discuss these matters.\n\nThere are no official results available of the 2007 [[elections in the Philippines|elections]] released by the party but according to the [[Philippine House of Representatives]], the party holds 79 out of 235 seats.\n\nOn January 16, 2008, Lakas spokesman and legal counsel [[Raul Lambino]] stated that Lakas\u2013CMD officially released the list of senatorial bets for 2010\u2014spokesman  in 2010. Except for Para\u00f1aque Representative Eduardo Zialcita, they were not yet identified.

In 2013, the party suffered its largest decline, due  to the arrest of the party's [[matriarchy|matriarch]], Gloria Arroyo; however the remaining party largely supports the [[United Nationalist Alliance]], with candidates from among its former members such as [[Migz Zubiri]], [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]] and [[Mitos Magsaysay]].\n\n===Duterte administration and dissolution===\n{{main|Coalition for Change (Philippines)}}\nIn the [[2016 Philippine presidential election|2016 Presidential Elections]], Lakas supports the candidacy of [[Rodrigo Roa Duterte|Rodrigo \"Rody/Digong\" Duterte]] and [[Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.|Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos, Jr.]] for President and Vice President respectively, which Duterte won and Marcos lost to Liberal Party candidate [[Leni Robredo|Ma.

It was a product of the [[Arthur Freed]] unit at [[MGM]], and is notable for its combination of studio and location filming, as a result of Gene Kelly's insistence that some scenes be shot in [[New York City]], including at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and [[Rockefeller Center]].\n\nThe film was an immediate success and won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music\u2014Scoring of a Musical Picture]], and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Cinematography (Color). Screenwriters Comden and Green won the [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for Best Written American Musical.\n\nIn 2006, the film ranked No. 19 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years of Musicals|list of Best Musicals]].

Riding the subway, Gabey falls in love with the picture of \"Miss Turnstiles\", who is actually called Ivy Smith, and fantasizes about what she's like in real life (\"Miss Turnstiles\").  The sailors race around New York attempting to find her in the brief period they have.\n\nThey are assisted by, and become romantically involved with, two women, and pair up: Ozzie with Claire, an anthropologist; and Chip with Hildy Esterhazy, an aggressively amorous taxi driver.  Claire claims that she's found her passionate \"Prehistoric Man\" in Ozzie at the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Anthropological History]]. Hildy invites Chip to \"Come Up to My Place\". Finally finding Ivy, Gabey takes her on an imaginary date down his home town \"Main Street\" in a studio in [[Carnegie Hall|Symphonic Hall]] - not realising that she is also from the same town.  Later, Chip sincerely falls for Hildy telling her \"You're Awful\"&nbsp;\u2013 that is, awful nice to be with. That evening, all the couples meet at the top of the [[Empire State Building]] to celebrate a night \"On the Town\".\n\nBut when an ashamed Ivy walks out on Gabey to get to her late night work as a [[Burlesque|cooch dancer]], the friends tell a despondent Gabey, \"You Can Count on Me\", joined by Hildy's annoying, but well-meaning roommate, Lucy Schmeeler. They have a number of adventures before reuniting with Ivy at [[Coney Island]] just as their 24-hour leave ends and they must return to their ship to head off to sea. Although their future is uncertain, the boys and girls share one last kiss on the pier as a new batch of sailors heads out into the city for their leave (\"New York, New York\" reprise).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gene Kelly]] as Gabey\n* [[Frank Sinatra]] as Chip\n* [[Betty Garrett]] as Brunhilde \"Hildy\" Esterhazy\n* [[Ann Miller]] as Claire Huddesen\n* [[Jules Munshin]] as Ozzie\n* [[Vera-Ellen]] as Ivy Smith\n* [[Florence Bates]] as Madame Dilyovska\n* [[Alice Pearce]] as Lucy Shmeeler\n* George Meader as Professor\n* [[Hans Conried]] as Fran\u00e7ois (head waiter) ''(uncredited)''\n\n'''Cast notes'''\n* [[Carol Haney]], Gene Kelly's assistant, performed with Kelly in the ''Day in New York'' ballet sequence, but was not credited.

It was a product of the [[Arthur Freed]] unit at [[MGM]], and is notable for its combination of studio and location filming, as a result of Gene Kelly's insistence that some scenes be shot in [[New York City]], including at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and [[Rockefeller Center]].\n\nThe film was an immediate success and won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music\u2014Scoring of a Musical Picture]], and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Cinematography (Color). Screenwriters Comden and Green won the [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for Best Written American Musical.\n\nIn 2006, the film ranked No. 19 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years of Musicals|list of Best Musicals]]. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>https://www.npr.org/2018/12/12/675384976/jurassic-park-the-shining-and-23-other-movies-added-to-national-film-registry</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThree sailors&nbsp;&ndash; Gabey, Chip, and Ozzie&nbsp;&ndash; begin their shore leave, excited for their 24 hours in New York (\"[[New York, New York (On the Town)|New York, New York]]\"). Riding the subway, Gabey falls in love with the picture of \"Miss Turnstiles\", who is actually called Ivy Smith, and fantasizes about what she's like in real life (\"Miss Turnstiles\").  The sailors race around New York attempting to find her in the brief period they have.\n\nThey are assisted by, and become romantically involved with, two women, and pair up: Ozzie with Claire, an anthropologist; and Chip with Hildy Esterhazy, an aggressively amorous taxi driver.  Claire claims that she's found her passionate \"Prehistoric Man\" in Ozzie at the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Anthropological History]]. Hildy invites Chip to \"Come Up to My Place\". Finally finding Ivy, Gabey takes her on an imaginary date down his home town \"Main Street\" in a studio in [[Carnegie Hall|Symphonic Hall]] - not realising that she is also from the same town.  Later, Chip sincerely falls for Hildy telling her \"You're Awful\"&nbsp;\u2013 that is, awful nice to be with. That evening, all the couples meet at the top of the [[Empire State Building]] to celebrate a night \"On the Town\".\n\nBut when an ashamed Ivy walks out on Gabey to get to her late night work as a [[Burlesque|cooch dancer]], the friends tell a despondent Gabey, \"You Can Count on Me\", joined by Hildy's annoying, but well-meaning roommate, Lucy Schmeeler. They have a number of adventures before reuniting with Ivy at [[Coney Island]] just as their 24-hour leave ends and they must return to their ship to head off to sea. Although their future is uncertain, the boys and girls share one last kiss on the pier as a new crew of sailors heads out into the city for their leave (\"New York, New York\" reprise).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Gene Kelly]] as Gabey\n* [[Frank Sinatra]] as Chip\n* [[Betty Garrett]] as Brunhilde \"Hildy\" Esterhazy\n* [[Ann Miller]] as Claire Huddesen\n* [[Jules Munshin]] as Ozzie\n* [[Vera-Ellen]] as Ivy Smith\n* [[Florence Bates]] as Madame Dilyovska\n* [[Alice Pearce]] as Lucy Shmeeler\n* George Meader as Professor\n* [[Hans Conried]] as Fran\u00e7ois (head waiter) ''(uncredited)''\n\n'''Cast notes'''\n* [[Carol Haney]], Gene Kelly's assistant, performed with Kelly in the ''Day in New York'' ballet sequence, but was not credited.

It consisted of a series of satirical interviews with fictional great men, who were played by Atkinson himself. The series was written by Atkinson and [[Richard Curtis]], and produced by [[Griff Rhys Jones]].<ref name=\"Atkinson people\">\"[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/31/tvandradio Pick of the Day]\", ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Television ===\nAfter university, Atkinson did a one-off pilot for [[London Weekend Television]] in 1979 called [[Canned Laughter (sitcom)|''Canned Laughter'']]. Atkinson then went on to do [[Not the Nine O'Clock News|''Not the Nine O'Clock News'']] for the [[BBC]], produced by his friend [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]]. He featured in the show with [[Pamela Stephenson]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]] and [[Mel Smith]], and was one of the main sketch writers.\n\nThe success of ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' led to him taking the lead role of [[Edmund Blackadder]] in ''[[Blackadder]]''. The first series [[The Black Adder|''The Black Adder'']] (1983), set in the medieval period, Atkinson co-wrote with [[Richard Curtis]]. After a three-year gap, in part due to budgetary concerns, a second series was broadcast, written by Curtis and [[Ben Elton]]. [[Blackadder II|''Blackadder II'']] (1986) followed the fortunes of one of the descendants of Atkinson's original character, this time in the [[Elizabethan era]]. The same pattern was repeated in the two more sequels [[Blackadder the Third|''Blackadder the Third'']] (1987), set in the [[Regency era]], and [[Blackadder Goes Forth|''Blackadder Goes Forth'']] (1989), set in World War I. The ''Blackadder'' series became one of the most successful of all [[BBC]] situation comedies, spawning television specials including [[Blackadder's Christmas Carol|''Blackadder's Christmas Carol'']] (1988), [[Blackadder: The Cavalier Years|''Blackadder: The Cavalier Years'']] (1988), and later [[Blackadder: Back & Forth|''Blackadder: Back & Forth'']] (1999), which was set at the turn of the Millennium. The final scene of \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" (when Blackadder and his men go \"over the top\" and charge into No-Man's-Land) has been described as \"bold and highly poignant\". Possessing an [[acerbic wit]] and armed with numerous quick put-downs (which are often wasted on those at whom they are directed), in a 2001 [[Channel 4]] poll Edmund Blackadder was ranked third (behind [[Homer Simpson]] from [[The Simpsons|''The Simpsons'']] and [[Basil Fawlty]] from [[Fawlty Towers|''Fawlty Towers'']]) on their list of the [[100 Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest TV Characters]]. During the 2014 [[centennial of the start of World War I]], Conservative Party politician [[Michael Gove]] and war historian [[Max Hastings]] complained about the so-called \"Blackadder version of history\".\n\nAtkinson in 1997, promoting ''Bean''. In 2014, young adults from abroad named Mr. Bean among a group of people they most associated with British culture.\n\nAtkinson's other creation, the hapless [[Mr. Bean|''Mr. Bean'']], first appeared on New Year's Day in 1990 in a half-hour special for [[Thames Television]]. The character of Mr. Bean has been likened to a modern-day [[Buster Keaton]], but Atkinson himself has stated that [[Jacques Tati]]'s character [[Monsieur Hulot]] was the main inspiration.\n\nSeveral sequels to ''Mr. Bean'' appeared on television until 1995, and the character later appeared in a feature film. [[Bean (film)|''Bean'']] (1997) was directed by Mel Smith, Atkinson's colleague in ''Not the Nine O'Clock News''. A second film, [[Mr. Bean's Holiday|''Mr. Bean's Holiday'']], was released in 2007. Atkinson portrayed Inspector Raymond Fowler in [[The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|''The Thin Blue Line'']] (1995\u201396), a television sitcom written by Ben Elton, which takes place in a police station located in fictitious Gasforth.\n\nAtkinson has fronted campaigns for [[Kronenbourg Brewery|Kronenbourg]], [[Fujifilm]], and [[Blood donation|Give Blood]]. Atkinson appeared as a hapless and error-prone espionage agent named Richard Lathum in a long-running series of adverts for [[Barclaycard]], on which character his title role in [[Johnny English|''Johnny English'']], [[Johnny English Reborn|''Johnny English Reborn'']] and [[Johnny English Strikes Again|''Johnny English Strikes Again'']] was based. In 1999, he played [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in [[Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death|''The Curse of Fatal Death'']], a special [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] serial produced for the charity telethon [[Comic Relief]]. Atkinson appeared as the ''Star in a Reasonably Priced Car'' on the BBC's [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|''Top Gear'']] in July 2011, driving the [[Kia Cee'd]] around the track in 1:42.2. Placing him at the top of the leaderboard, his lap time was significantly quicker than the previous high-profile record holder [[Tom Cruise]], whose time was a 1:44.2.\n\nAtkinson appeared at the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]] in London as Mr. Bean in a comedy sketch during a performance of \"[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]\", playing a repeated single note on [[synthesizer]]. He then lapsed into a dream sequence in which he joined the runners from the [[Chariots of Fire|film of the same name]] (about the [[1924 Summer Olympics]]), beating them in their iconic run along West Sands at St. Andrews, by riding in a [[minicab]] and tripping the front runner. Atkinson starred as [[Jules Maigret]] in [[Maigret (2016 TV series)|''Maigret'']], a series of television films from ITV.\n\n=== Retirement of Mr. Bean Live ===\nIn November 2012, it emerged that Rowan Atkinson intended to retire Mr. Bean. \"The stuff that has been most commercially successful for me \u2014 basically quite physical, quite childish \u2014 I increasingly feel I'm going to do a lot less of,\" Atkinson told [[The Daily Telegraph|''The Daily Telegraph'']]'s Review. \"Apart from the fact that your physical ability starts to decline, I also think someone in their 50s being childlike becomes a little sad. You've got to be careful.\" He has also said that the role [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] him to a degree. Despite these comments, Atkinson said in 2016 that he would never retire the character of Mr. Bean.\n\nIn October 2014, Atkinson also appeared as Mr. Bean in a TV advert for [[Snickers]]. In 2015, he starred alongside [[Ben Miller]] and [[Rebecca Front]] in a sketch for BBC [[Red Nose Day]] in which Mr. Bean attends a funeral.\n\nIn 2017, he appeared as Mr. Bean in the Chinese film ''Huan Le Xi Ju Ren''. In October 2018, Atkinson (as Mr. Bean) received [[YouTube Play Buttons|YouTube's Diamond Play Button]] for his channel surpassing 10 million subscribers on the video platform. Among the most-watched channels in the world, in 2017 it had more than 4.5 billion views.\n\n=== Animated Mr. Bean ===\nIn January 2014, ITV announced a new animated series featuring Mr. Bean with Rowan Atkinson returning to the role. It was expected to be released online as a Web-series later in 2014, as a television broadcast followed shortly after.\n\nOn 6 February 2018, Regular Capital announced that there would be a Season 5 of the Animated Mr Bean in 2019 (voiced by Atkinson). The first episode, Teddy's King, aired in February 2019.\n\nFollowing yet another 3-year hiatus, a fifth season consisting of 26 episodes is scheduled to premiere in 2019 on CITV as well as on [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]] channels worldwide.\n\n=== Film ===\nAtkinson's film career began with a supporting part in the \"unofficial\" [[James Bond]] movie [[Never Say Never Again|''Never Say Never Again'']] (1983) and a leading role in [[Dead on Time (1983 film)|''Dead on Time'']] (also 1983) with [[Nigel Hawthorne]]. He was in the 1988 Oscar-winning short film [[The Appointments of Dennis Jennings|''The Appointments of Dennis Jennings'']]. He appeared in Mel Smith's directorial debut [[The Tall Guy|''The Tall Guy'']] (1989) and appeared alongside [[Anjelica Huston]] and [[Mai Zetterling]] in [[The Witches (1990 film)|''The Witches'']] (1990), a film adaptation of the [[Roald Dahl]] [[The Witches (novel)|children's novel]]. He played the part of Dexter Hayman in [[Hot Shots! Part Deux|''Hot Shots! Part Deux'']] (1993), a parody of [[Rambo III|''Rambo III'']], starring [[Charlie Sheen]].\n\nAtkinson gained further recognition with his turn as a verbally bumbling vicar in [[Four Weddings and a Funeral|''Four Weddings and a Funeral'']] (1994, written and directed by his long time collaborator [[Richard Curtis]]), and featured in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] [[The Lion King|''The Lion King'']] (also 1994) as the voice of Zazu the [[red-billed hornbill]]. He also sang the song \u201c[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]\u201d in ''The Lion King''. Atkinson continued to appear in supporting roles in comedies, including [[Rat Race (film)|''Rat Race'']] (2001), [[Scooby-Doo (film)|''Scooby-Doo'']] (2002), jewellery salesman Rufus in another Richard Curtis British-set romantic comedy, [[Love Actually|''Love Actually'']] (2003), and the crime comedy [[Keeping Mum|''Keeping Mum'']] (2005), which also starred [[Kristin Scott Thomas]], [[Maggie Smith]], and [[Patrick Swayze]].\n\nIn addition to his supporting roles, Atkinson has also had success as a leading man. His television character Mr. Bean debuted on the big screen with [[Bean (film)|''Bean'']] (1997) to international success. A sequel, [[Mr. Bean's Holiday|''Mr. Bean's Holiday'']] (2007), (again inspired to some extent by Jacques Tati in his film \u2018Les Vacances de M. Hulot\u2019), also became an international success. He has also starred in the James Bond parody [[Johnny English (film series)|''Johnny English film series'']] (2003\u20132018).\n\n=== Theatre ===\nRowan Atkinson performed live on-stage skits \u2014 also appearing with members of [[Monty Python]] \u2014 in [[The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)|''The Secret Policeman's Ball'']] (1979) in London for [[Amnesty International]]. Atkinson undertook a four-month tour of the UK in 1980. A recording of the stage performance was subsequently released as [[Live in Belfast|''Live in Belfast'']]''.''\n\nIn 1984, Atkinson appeared in a [[West End theatre|West End]] version of the comedy play [[The Nerd (play)|''The Nerd'']] alongside a 10-year-old [[Christian Bale]]. ''The Sneeze and Other Stories'', seven short [[Anton Chekhov]] plays, translated and adapted by [[Michael Frayn]], were performed by Rowan Atkinson, [[Timothy West]] and [[Cheryl Campbell]] at the [[Aldwych Theatre]], London in 1988 and early 1989.\n\n''Oliver!'' billboard at the West End's [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 2009.\n\nIn 2009, during the West End revival of the musical ''[[Oliver!]]'' based on [[Charles Dickens]]' novel [[Oliver Twist|''Oliver Twist'']], Atkinson played the role of [[Fagin]]. His portrayal and singing of Fagin at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London gained favourable reviews and he was nominated for an [[Laurence Olivier Award|Olivier Award]] for best actor in a musical or entertainment.\n\nOn 28 November 2012, Rowan Atkinson reprised the role of Blackadder at the \"We Are Most Amused\" comedy gala for [[The Prince's Trust]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London. He was joined by Tony Robinson as Baldrick. The sketch involved the first new Blackadder material for 10 years, with Blackadder as CEO of Melchett, Melchett and Darling bank facing an enquiry over the banking crisis.\n\nIn February 2013, Atkinson took on the titular role in a 12-week production (directed by [[Richard Eyre]]) of the [[Simon Gray]] play [[Quartermaine's Terms|''Quartermaine's Terms'']] at [[Wyndham's Theatre]] in London with costars [[Conleth Hill]] ([[Game of Thrones|''Game of Thrones'']]) and [[Felicity Montagu]] ([[I'm Alan Partridge|''I'm Alan Partridge'']]). In December 2013, he revived his schoolmaster sketch for Royal Free Hospital's Rocks with Laughter at the Adelphi Theatre. A few days prior, he performed a selection of sketches in a small coffee venue in front of only 30 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theindychannel.com/entertainment/rowan-atkinson-plays-surprise-comedy-show-in-london_26375720|title=Rowan-Atkinson-plays-surprise-comedy-show-in-London_26375720|author=(SMH/WNTSU/LR)|work=RTV6|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217104405/http://www.theindychannel.com/entertainment/rowan-atkinson-plays-surprise-comedy-show-in-london_26375720|archivedate=17 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Comic style ==\nBest known for his use of [[physical comedy]] in his Mr. Bean persona, Atkinson's other characters rely more on language. Atkinson often plays authority figures (especially priests or vicars) speaking absurd lines with a completely [[deadpan]] delivery.\n\nOne of his better-known [[comedic device|comic devices]] is over-articulation of the \"B\" sound, such as his pronunciation of \"[[Bob (Blackadder character)|Bob]]\" in the ''[[Blackadder II]]'' episode \"[[Bells (Blackadder)|Bells]]\". Atkinson suffers from a [[Stuttering|stammer]],<ref>{{cite news|title=10 Questions for Rowan Atkinson|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1655712,00.html|access-date=1 June 2011|work=Time|date=23 August 2007}}</ref> and the over-articulation is a technique to overcome problematic consonants.\n\nAtkinson's often visually based style, which has been compared to that of [[Buster Keaton]],<ref name=\"Museum.tv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/atkinsonrow.htm|title=Museum.tv|publisher=Museum.tv|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005150240/http://www.museum.tv/eotv/atkinsonrow.htm|archive-date=5 October 2014|access-date=21 June 2011}}</ref> sets him apart from most modern television and film comics, who rely heavily on dialogue, as well as stand-up comedy which is mostly based on monologues. This talent for visual comedy has led to Atkinson being called \"the man with the rubber face\"; comedic reference was made to this in an episode of ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (\"[[Sense and Senility]]\"), in which [[Baldrick]] ([[Tony Robinson]]) refers to his master, [[Edmund Blackadder|Mr. E. Blackadder]], as a \"lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard\".\n\n==Influences==\n\nAtkinson's early comedy influences were the sketch comedy troupe ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', made up of [[Peter Cook]], [[Dudley Moore]], [[Jonathan Miller]] and [[Alan Bennett]], major figures of the 1960s British [[satire boom]], and then [[Monty Python]]. Atkinson states, \u201cI remember watching them avidly as students at university.\u201d<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He continued to be influenced by the work of [[John Cleese]] following his Monty Python days, regarding Cleese as being \u201ca major, major inspiration\u201d, adding, \u201cI think that he and I are quite different in our style and our approach, but certainly it was comedy I liked to watch. He was very physical. Yes, very physical and very angry.\u201d<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He was also influenced by [[Peter Sellers]], whose characters [[Hrundi Bakshi]] from ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]'' (1968) and [[Inspector Clouseau]] from ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' films influenced Atkinson's characters Mr. Bean and Johnny English.<ref>{{cite news |title=Want funny?

It consisted of a series of satirical interviews with fictional great men, who were played by Atkinson himself. The series was written by Atkinson and [[Richard Curtis]], and produced by [[Griff Rhys Jones]].<ref name=\"Atkinson people\">\"[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/31/tvandradio Pick of the Day]\", ''The Guardian'', 31 January 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Television ===\nAfter university, Atkinson did a one-off pilot for [[London Weekend Television]] in 1979 called ''[[Canned Laughter (sitcom)|Canned Laughter]]''. Atkinson then went on to do ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]'' for the [[BBC]], produced by his friend [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]]. He featured in the show with [[Pamela Stephenson]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]] and [[Mel Smith]], and was one of the main sketch writers.\n\nThe success of ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' led to him taking the lead role of [[Edmund Blackadder]] in ''[[Blackadder]]''. The first series ''[[The Black Adder]]'' (1983), set in medieval period, Atkinson co-wrote with [[Richard Curtis]]. After a three-year gap, in part due to budgetary concerns, a second series was broadcast, written by Curtis and [[Ben Elton]]. ''[[Blackadder II]]'' (1986) followed the fortunes of one of the descendants of Atkinson's original character, this time in the [[Elizabethan era]]. The same pattern was repeated in the two more sequels ''[[Blackadder the Third]]'' (1987), set in the [[Regency era]], and ''[[Blackadder Goes Forth]]'' (1989), set in World War I.

Blackadder]], as a \"lazy, big-nosed, rubber-faced bastard\".\n\n==Influences==\n\nAtkinson's early comedy influences were the sketch comedy troupe ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', made up of [[Peter Cook]], [[Dudley Moore]], [[Jonathan Miller]] and [[Alan Bennett]], major figures of the 1960s British [[satire boom]], and then [[Monty Python]]. Atkinson states, \u201cI remember watching them avidly as students at university.\u201d<ref name=\"LA Times\"/> He continued to be influenced by the work of [[John Cleese]] following his Monty Python days, regarding Cleese as being \u201ca major, major inspiration\u201d, adding, \u201cI think that he and I are quite different in our style and our approach, but certainly it was comedy I liked to watch.
