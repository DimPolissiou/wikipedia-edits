It was built by the [[Cenomanni]] Gauls, but later became a Roman colony and a frontier fortress.\n\nAbout 600 Cremona, until then a part of the Byzantine Emperor, was captured by the Lombard king, [[Agilulf]]. Under the [[Emperor Otto I]] and his successors, its bishops acquired temporal sovereignty, but in 900 the people expelled Bishop [[Olderico]] and adopted a republican form of government.\n\nThe [[Emperor Henry IV]] (1056\u20131106), however, confirmed Bishop [[Landulf (bishop of Cremona)|Landulf]] in all imperial grants made to his predecessors. On the other hand [[Emperor Henry V]] (1106\u201325) restored to the people their communal rights. Thenceforth Cremona became a citadel of [[Ghibellinism]] and was greatly favoured by [[Frederic Barbarossa]] and [[Emperor Frederick II]], though for the same reason frequently at war with the neighbouring cities. In later medieval times it had many lords or \"tyrants\", the [[Pallavicini]], the [[Bovara]], the [[Cavalcabo]], the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]], the [[Sforza]], until it became part of the [[Duchy of Milan]] (1328). In 1702 it was taken by imperial troops, and in 1796 and 1800 fell into the hands of the French.\n\nThe people of Cremona venerate [[St. Sabinus]] as their first missionary and first bishop; he is said to have lived in the 1st century of our era. Among the better-known early bishops are [[St. Syrinus]] (c. 340), a valiant apologist of the Faith against the [[Arianism|Arians]], and [[St. Silvinus]] (733); the latter is held in great veneration. [[Liudprand of Cremona]] was sent (946) as ambassador to [[Constantinople]] by the [[Emperor Otto II]], and is the most famous historical writer of the 10th century.\n\nOther important bishops were Gualtiero (1096), in whose time the cathedral was begun; [[Sicardo]] (1185), author of a chronicle; Cacciaconte da Somma (1261), under whom was erected the belfry of the cathedral; [[Niccolo Sfondrati]] (1560), later Pope Gregory XIV; his nephew Paolo (1607); also the zealous and charitable Omobono di Offredi (1791).\n\n==Bishops==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\n* Stephen I (320\u2013342)\n* Sirino I (342\u2013380)\n* Auderio (381\u2013391)\n* Conrad\n* Vincenzo (407\u2013?)\n* St. Sirino II (422\u2013451)\n* John I (451\u2013?)\n* Eustasius, Eustachio (491\u2013 c. 513)\n* Crisogono (513\u2013537)\n* Felix (537\u2013562)\n* Creato (563 \u2013 c. 584)\n* Sisto (584 \u2013 c. 609)\n* Desiderius I (609\u2013610)\n* Anselm (610\u2013?)\n* Eusebius (c. 637\u2013?)\n* Bernard (670\u2013?)\n* Desiderius II (679\u2013?)\n* Zeno, OSB (703\u2013?)\n* Silvino (733\u2013?)\n* Stephen II (776\u2013?)\n* Walfred (816\u2013818)\n* Atto (818\u2013823)\n* Siniperto degli Addobati (823\u2013?)\n* Pancoardo (840\u2013851)\n* Benedict (c. 851 \u2013 c. 878)\n* Lando (c. 878\u2013?)\n* John II (c. 915\u2013924, c.f.

It was built by the [[Cenomanni]] Gauls, but later became a Roman colony and a frontier fortress.\n\nAbout 600 Cremona, until then a part of the Byzantine Emperor, was captured by the Lombard king, [[Agilulf]]. Under the [[Emperor Otto I]] and his successors, its bishops acquired temporal sovereignty, but in 900 the people expelled Bishop [[Olderico]] and adopted a republican form of government.\n\nThe [[Emperor Henry IV]] (1056\u20131106), however, confirmed Bishop [[Landulf (bishop of Cremona)|Landulf]] in all imperial grants made to his predecessors. On the other hand [[Emperor Henry V]] (1106\u201325) restored to the people their communal rights. Thenceforth Cremona became a citadel of [[Ghibellinism]] and was greatly favoured by [[Frederic Barbarossa]] and [[Emperor Frederick II]], though for the same reason frequently at war with the neighbouring cities. In later medieval times it had many lords or \"tyrants\", the [[Pallavicini]], the [[Bovara]], the [[Cavalcabo]], the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]], the [[Sforza]], until it became part of the [[Duchy of Milan]] (1328). In 1702 it was taken by imperial troops, and in 1796 and 1800 fell into the hands of the French.\n\nThe people of Cremona venerate [[St. Sabinus]] as their first missionary and first bishop; he is said to have lived in the 1st century of our era. Among the better-known early bishops are [[St. Syrinus]] (c. 340), a valiant apologist of the Faith against the [[Arianism|Arians]], and [[St. Silvinus]] (733); the latter is held in great veneration. [[Liudprand of Cremona]] was sent (946) as ambassador to [[Constantinople]] by the [[Emperor Otto II]], and is the most famous historical writer of the 10th century.\n\nOther important bishops were Gualtiero (1096), in whose time the cathedral was begun; [[Sicardo]] (1185), author of a chronicle; Cacciaconte da Somma (1261), under whom was erected the belfry of the cathedral; [[Niccolo Sfondrati]] (1560), later Pope Gregory XIV; his nephew Paolo (1607); also the zealous and charitable Omobono di Offredi (1791).\n\n==Bishops==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\n* Stephen I (320\u2013342)\n* Sirino I (342\u2013380)\n* Auderio (381\u2013391)\n* Conrad\n* Vincenzo (407\u2013?)\n* St. Sirino II (422\u2013451)\n* John I (451\u2013?)\n* Eustasius, Eustachio (491\u2013 c. 513)\n* Crisogono (513\u2013537)\n* Felix (537\u2013562)\n* Creato (563 \u2013 c. 584)\n* Sisto (584 \u2013 c. 609)\n* Desiderius I (609\u2013610)\n* Anselm (610\u2013?)\n* Eusebius (c. 637\u2013?)\n* Bernard (670\u2013?)\n* Desiderius II (679\u2013?)\n* Zeno, OSB (703\u2013?)\n* Silvino (733\u2013?)\n* Stephen II (776\u2013?)\n* Walfred (816\u2013818)\n* Atto (818\u2013823)\n* Siniperto degli Addobati (823\u2013?)\n* Pancoardo (840\u2013851)\n* Benedict (c. 851 \u2013 c. 878)\n* Lando (c. 878\u2013?)\n* John II (c. 915\u2013924, c.f.

The first is the [[Pro-independence movements in Russian Civil War|disintegration of the Russian Empire]] as a result of the [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]] in 1917\u20131921. Active disintegration processes began in the economy, social structure, public and political spheres of the [[Russian Empire]], which ultimately led to the end of the Tsarist regime and became parts of independent states as [[Poland]], [[Finland]] and [[Romania]]. The second is the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1990\u20131991 which led to the independence of the 15 republics of the USSR ([[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]).\n\nIn the 1990s, a number of regions wanted to secede from the Russian Federation: the [[Chechen\u2013Russian conflict|Chechen Wars]] (with the  [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]]), the [[Republic of Tatarstan]], which finally became part of Russia only in the mid-1990s, can also be attributed to the disintegration processes which, nevertheless, managed to be stopped.\n\n== Possible causes of decay ==\nChief researcher, [[Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of philosophy RAS]] V.

In addition the German emperors held the overlordship of the Po Valley and from time to time dominated the political situation.<ref>Solera, p. 8.</ref>  Otto of Freising (died 1158), for instance, draws attention to Crema's situation in the perpetual struggle between Cremona and Milan. Crema was situated just halfway between Cremona and Milan.  It bore a good deal of the military action, and, as Cremona regularly rejected its demands in litigation for redress and reparations, Crema developed a grudge.  This was particularly wrenching since Crema was politically subject to Cremona and spiritually subject to its bishop. To gain an advantage, the leaders of Cremona urged the Emperor Frederic Barbarossa to destroy Crema in exchange for a considerable sum of money, which would allow him to pursue his ventures in the Po Valley. The citizens of Crema therefore threw in their lot with Milan.<ref>Otto of Freising, ''Gesta Friderici Imperatoris'' Book IV, chapter 39, in: ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica'' Tomus XX, (Hannover 1868), p. 466.</ref>\n\nCrema became subject to the [[Republic of Venice]] in September 1512, and the possession was ratified by the Treaty of Blois of 1513.<ref>{{cite book|author1=M.

In addition the German emperors held the overlordship of the Po Valley and from time to time dominated the political situation.<ref>Solera, p. 8.</ref>  Otto of Freising (died 1158), for instance, draws attention to Crema's situation in the perpetual struggle between Cremona and Milan. Crema was situated just halfway between Cremona and Milan.  It bore a good deal of the military action, and, as Cremona regularly rejected its demands in litigation for redress and reparations, Crema developed a grudge.  This was particularly wrenching since Crema was politically subject to Cremona and spiritually subject to its bishop. To gain an advantage, the leaders of Cremona urged the Emperor Frederic Barbarossa to destroy Crema in exchange for a considerable sum of money, which would allow him to pursue his ventures in the Po Valley. The citizens of Crema therefore threw in their lot with Milan.<ref>Otto of Freising, ''Gesta Friderici Imperatoris'' Book IV, chapter 39, in: ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica'' Tomus XX, (Hannover 1868), p. 466.</ref>\n\nCrema became subject to the [[Republic of Venice]] in September 1512, and the possession was ratified by the Treaty of Blois of 1513.<ref>{{cite book|author1=M.

From that time until 1325 the city and its territory were assigned ecclesiastically to the [[Diocese of Arezzo]].\n\nAt the beginning of the 14th century, however, Arezzo and Cortona were still involved in the struggles between the [[Guelfs and Ghibellines|Guelfs and the Ghibellines]]. Arezzo was Ghibelline in allegiance, supporting the emperor; Cortona, which had been conquered by Arezzo in 1258, was Guelf, and supported the papal states.<ref>{{cite book|author=Blake R.

This expansionist activity greatly alarmed both the Florentines and [[Pope John XXII]], who, though safely settled in Avignon, feared for the loss of church territories and the threat to the papal states.

Based on the revisions, a set of ''Normae'' was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, ''aeque personaliter'', was abolished. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under [[Pope John XXIII]] for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese. In Tuscany, this particularly affected three dioceses: Arezzo, Cortona, and Borgo San Sepolcro (Biturgensis).\n\nOn 30 September 1986, [[Pope John Paul II]] ordered that the dioceses of Arezzo, Cortona, and San Sepolcro be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title ''Dioecesis Arretina-Cortonensis-Biturgensis''. The seat of the diocese was to be in Arezzo, and the cathedral of Arezzo was to serve as the cathedral of the merged diocese. The cathedrals in Cortona and San Sepolcro were to become co-cathedrals, and their cathedral Chapters were to be a ''Capitulum Concathedralis''. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Arezzo, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. The territory of the new diocese was to include the territory of the former dioceses of Cortona and Borgo San Sepolcro.<ref>''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 79 (Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano 1987), pp. 654-656.</ref>\n\n==Bishops==\n===from 1325 to 1603===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Rainerius Ubertini (1325\u20131348)<ref>Rainerius Ubertini was the brother of Boso Ubertini, the Provost of Arezzo, who had been named Apostolic Administrator of Arezzo when Bishop Guido Tarlati was excommunicated and deposed.

Based on the revisions, a set of ''Normae'' was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, ''aeque personaliter'', was abolished. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under [[Pope John XXIII]] for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese. In Tuscany, this particularly affected three dioceses: Arezzo, Cortona, and Borgo San Sepolcro (Biturgensis).\n\nOn 30 September 1986, [[Pope John Paul II]] ordered that the dioceses of Arezzo, Cortona, and San Sepolcro be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title ''Dioecesis Arretina-Cortonensis-Biturgensis''. The seat of the diocese was to be in Arezzo, and the cathedral of Arezzo was to serve as the cathedral of the merged diocese. The cathedrals in Cortona and San Sepolcro were to become co-cathedrals, and their cathedral Chapters were to be a ''Capitulum Concathedralis''. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Arezzo, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. The territory of the new diocese was to include the territory of the former dioceses of Cortona and Borgo San Sepolcro.<ref>''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 79 (Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano 1987), pp. 654-656.</ref>\n\n==Bishops==\n===from 1325 to 1603===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Rainerius Ubertini (1325\u20131348)<ref>Rainerius Ubertini was the brother of Boso Ubertini, the Provost of Arezzo, who had been named Apostolic Administrator of Arezzo when Bishop Guido Tarlati was excommunicated and deposed.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11.

Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

His daughter Kayley dreams of becoming a [[knight]] like her father. At [[Camelot]], one of the knights, Ruber - wanting to usurp [[King Arthur]] - attempts to kill him, but Lionel sacrifices himself and is killed. Ruber flees Camelot in exile after being rebounded by Arthur's sword [[Excalibur]]. During Lionel's funeral, Arthur tells Kayley and her mother, Juliana, that they will be welcomed should they come to Camelot.\n\nA decade later, a [[griffin]] attacks Camelot, stealing Excalibur. [[Merlin]]'s falcon Ayden attacks the griffin and the sword falls into the Forbidden Forest. Meanwhile, Ruber invades Kayley's home, holds everyone hostage and uses a potion he purchased from [[Witchcraft|witches]] to create steel warriors from his human henchmen and a [[rooster]], who becomes known as Bladebeak. He plans to use Juliana to gain entrance into Camelot.\n\nAfter escaping and eavesdropping on Ruber and the griffin's conversation, Kayley enters the Forbidden Forest where she encounters Garrett; a [[Visual impairment|blind]] [[hermit]], and Ayden. Kayley convinces him to help her find Excalibur and learns that Garrett was once a stable boy in Camelot, and was blinded by one of the horses that he was rescuing from a stable fire. Lionel stood by Garrett, and taught him to adapt to his conditions.\n\nThey enter [[Dragon]] Country and meet a [[Polycephaly|two-headed dragon]] named Devon and Cornwall who hate each other, cannot breathe fire or fly, and want to be two individual dragons. Devon and Cornwall decide to join to the group; Garrett reluctantly agrees after Kayley convinces him.\n\nLater, they find the belt of Excalibur in a giant footprint. Kayley's insistence of distracting Garrett causes him to miss Ayden's signal, and he is injured by one of Ruber's men. Kayley uses the thorn bushed [[Legendary creature|creatures]] to hold Ruber and his men captive, and escorts Garrett into a remote cave where the magic of the forest heals Garrett's wounds. Whilst in the cave, Kayley and Garrett begin to fall in love. The group goes into a giant cave where a rock-like [[ogre]] holds Excalibur, using it as a toothpick. Kayley succeeds in retrieving Excalibur and they escape before Ruber can get to it.\n\nExiting the forest with Excalibur, Garrett chooses to stay in the forest, feeling uncomfortable in Camelot. After he leaves, Ruber captures Kayley and takes Excalibur. Devon and Cornwall, who witness this, rush to Garrett and convince him to save Kayley. By working together for the first time, Devon and Cornwall are able to fly and breathe fire, and they hold off the griffin. Meanwhile, Kayley is bound and gagged in one of the wagons; Bladebeak frees Kayley from her ropes as Garrett comes to her aid and they enter the castle.\n\nInside, they find Ruber attempting to kill Arthur with Excalibur, now bonded to his arm with his magic potion. Kayley and Garrett intervene and trick Ruber into returning Excalibur to its stone, causing its magic to disintegrate Ruber and revert the mechanical men, including Bladebeak, back to normal. Later, with Camelot restored to its former glory, Kayley and Garrett become knights of the round table.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jessalyn Gilsig]] as Kayley, a teenage girl who wants to be a knight, and saves [[Camelot]].\n** [[Andrea Corr]] does singing vocals for Kayley.\n** [[Sarah Freeman (actress)|Sarah Rayne]] as Kayley as a child.\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Garrett, a blind [[hermit]] who helps Kayley save [[Camelot]].\n** [[Bryan White]] does singing vocals for Garrett\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Ruber, a former knight that wants to be the king of [[Camelot]].

His daughter Kayley dreams of becoming a [[knight]] like her father. At [[Camelot]], one of the knights, Ruber - wanting to usurp [[King Arthur]] - attempts to kill him, but Lionel sacrifices himself and is killed. Ruber flees Camelot in exile after being rebounded by Arthur's sword [[Excalibur]]. During Lionel's funeral, Arthur tells Kayley and her mother, Juliana, that they will be welcomed should they come to Camelot.\n\nA decade later, a [[griffin]] attacks Camelot, stealing Excalibur. [[Merlin]]'s falcon Ayden attacks the griffin and the sword falls into the Forbidden Forest. Meanwhile, Ruber invades Kayley's home, holds everyone hostage and uses a potion he purchased from [[Witchcraft|witches]] to create steel warriors from his human henchmen and a [[rooster]], who becomes known as Bladebeak. He plans to use Juliana to gain entrance into Camelot.\n\nAfter escaping and eavesdropping on Ruber and the griffin's conversation, Kayley enters the Forbidden Forest where she encounters Garrett; a [[Visual impairment|blind]] [[hermit]], and Ayden. Kayley convinces him to help her find Excalibur and learns that Garrett was once a stable boy in Camelot, and was blinded by one of the horses that he was rescuing from a stable fire. Lionel stood by Garrett, and taught him to adapt to his conditions.\n\nThey enter [[Dragon]] Country and meet a [[Polycephaly|two-headed dragon]] named Devon and Cornwall who hate each other, cannot breathe fire or fly, and want to be two individual dragons. Devon and Cornwall decide to join to the group; Garrett reluctantly agrees after Kayley convinces him.\n\nLater, they find the belt of Excalibur in a giant footprint. Kayley's insistence of distracting Garrett causes him to miss Ayden's signal, and he is injured by one of Ruber's men. Kayley uses the thorn bushed [[Legendary creature|creatures]] to hold Ruber and his men captive, and escorts Garrett into a remote cave where the magic of the forest heals Garrett's wounds. Whilst in the cave, Kayley and Garrett begin to fall in love. The group goes into a giant cave where a rock-like [[ogre]] holds Excalibur, using it as a toothpick. Kayley succeeds in retrieving Excalibur and they escape before Ruber can get to it.\n\nExiting the forest with Excalibur, Garrett chooses to stay in the forest, feeling uncomfortable in Camelot. After he leaves, Ruber captures Kayley and takes Excalibur. Devon and Cornwall, who witness this, rush to Garrett and convince him to save Kayley. By working together for the first time, Devon and Cornwall are able to fly and breathe fire, and they hold off the griffin. Meanwhile, Kayley is bound and gagged in one of the wagons; Bladebeak frees Kayley from her ropes as Garrett comes to her aid and they enter the castle.\n\nInside, they find Ruber attempting to kill Arthur with Excalibur, now bonded to his arm with his magic potion. Kayley and Garrett intervene and trick Ruber into returning Excalibur to its stone, causing its magic to disintegrate Ruber and revert the mechanical men, including Bladebeak, back to normal. Later, with Camelot restored to its former glory, Kayley and Garrett become knights of the round table.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jessalyn Gilsig]] as Kayley, a teenage girl who wants to be a knight, and saves [[Camelot]].\n** [[Andrea Corr]] does singing vocals for Kayley.\n** [[Sarah Freeman (actress)|Sarah Rayne]] as Kayley as a child.\n* [[Cary Elwes]] as Garrett, a blind [[hermit]] who helps Kayley save [[Camelot]].\n** [[Bryan White]] does singing vocals for Garrett\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Ruber, a former knight that wants to be the king of [[Camelot]].

After the invasion of the Normans, it was for a while the seat of a duchy; later, however, it became a fief of the [[dukes of Atri]].\n\nLocal tradition preserves the name of a bishop, Simplicius, who attended the Roman synod of 487 and died in 492, but he belongs to legend, not history.<ref>Lanzoni, p. 303, who notes that his name is not found in the acta of that synod.</ref> Ferdinando Ughelli<ref>''Italia sacra'' VII, p. 701.</ref> prints the narrative of Francesco Giuliano of Conversano concerning Simplicius, but states that it seems to him to be highly suspect, and maybe deliberately invented falsehoods or corrupt, since there are some things found in it which cannot be true.<ref>''...mihi valde suspecta videtur, et forte commentitia vel corrupta, cum in ea aliqua sint apposita quae cum veritate esse non possunt.''</ref>\n\nThe first alleged bishop of Conversano was [[Hilarius (bishop, fl. 501)|Hilarius]], present at the Roman synod of 501. His name however is a false reading of the acts of the synod; he actually belonged to Tempsa in the Abruzzi, not to Conversano in Apulia.\n\nNo other names are recorded up to the episcopate of Leo, mentioned in a document of 1088.\n\nIn 1670 (and 1744) the Chapter of the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Body of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven was composed of four dignities (the Archdeacon, the Archpriest, the Cantor and the Primicerius<ref>Ughelli, p. 700.</ref>) and twenty-six Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 171 note 1; VI, p. 181 note 1.

After the invasion of the Normans, it was for a while the seat of a duchy; later, however, it became a fief of the [[dukes of Atri]].\n\nLocal tradition preserves the name of a bishop, Simplicius, who attended the Roman synod of 487 and died in 492, but he belongs to legend, not history.<ref>Lanzoni, p. 303, who notes that his name is not found in the acta of that synod.</ref> Ferdinando Ughelli<ref>''Italia sacra'' VII, p. 701.</ref> prints the narrative of Francesco Giuliano of Conversano concerning Simplicius, but states that it seems to him to be highly suspect, and maybe deliberately invented falsehoods or corrupt, since there are some things found in it which cannot be true.<ref>''...mihi valde suspecta videtur, et forte commentitia vel corrupta, cum in ea aliqua sint apposita quae cum veritate esse non possunt.''</ref>\n\nThe first alleged bishop of Conversano was [[Hilarius (bishop, fl. 501)|Hilarius]], present at the Roman synod of 501. His name however is a false reading of the acts of the synod; he actually belonged to Tempsa in the Abruzzi, not to Conversano in Apulia.\n\nNo other names are recorded up to the episcopate of Leo, mentioned in a document of 1088.\n\nIn 1670 (and 1744) the Chapter of the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Body of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven was composed of four dignities (the Archdeacon, the Archpriest, the Cantor and the Primicerius<ref>Ughelli, p. 700.</ref>) and twenty-six Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 171 note 1; VI, p. 181 note 1.

It is a [[suffragan diocese]] of the [[Archdiocese of Los Angeles]].  Geographically, the diocese consists of {{convert|35239|sqmi|km2}} of the Southern [[San Joaquin Valley]] of California, a portion of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and some eastern valleys. The diocese consists of all of the Counties of [[Fresno County, California|Fresno]], [[Inyo County, California|Inyo]], [[Kern County, California|Kern]], [[Kings County, California|Kings]], [[Madera County, California|Madera]], [[Mariposa County, California|Mariposa]], [[Merced County, California|Merced]], and [[Tulare County, California|Tulare]].  The total population of the diocesan region is about 2.4 million inhabitants, of whom 1,074,944 are registered Catholic as of 2012.  For administrative purposes the diocese is sub-divided into five deaneries: [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] City, Fresno (rural), [[Hanford, California|Tulare/Kings]], [[Kern County, California|Kern]]/[[Inyo County, California|Inyo]], and [[Merced, California|Merced/Mariposa]].\n\n==History==\nThe see was created in 1967 by splitting the [[Diocese of Monterey-Fresno]] into two sees.  Historically the area of the current diocese belonged to the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Guadalajara|Guadalajara]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Durango|Durango]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sonora|Sonora]], Californias, Monterey, Monterey-Los Angeles, and lastly Monterey-Fresno. [[Timothy Manning]] (first Bishop of Fresno) and [[Roger Mahony]] (Auxiliary Bishop) have both served in the diocese.\n\nThe most recent [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]], [[John Thomas Steinbock]], was appointed the fourth Bishop of Fresno on October 15, 1991, taking over from Apostolic Administrator Most Rev.
