{"title_page": "List of national border changes since World War I", "text_new": "Since [[World War I]], there have been numerous changes in [[border]]s between [[nations]], detailed below. For information on border changes from the end of the Napoleonic Wars to 1914, see [[List of national border changes from 1815 to 1914]]. Cases are only listed where there have been changes in borders, not necessarily including changes in ownership of a territory. For instance, many European colonies in Africa became independent without any adjustment to their borders, although some did have many changes. Also mentioned are some de facto changes, not recognized by the international community, such as [[Crimea]], [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]], and [[South Ossetia]].\n\n==Africa==\n* 1919 \u2014 The [[treaty of Versailles]] divides Germany's African colonies into mandates of the victors (which largely become new colonies of the victors). Most of Cameroon becomes a French mandate with a small portion taken by the British and some territory incorporated into France's previously existing colonies; [[Togo]] is mostly taken by the British, though the French gain a slim portion; [[German East Africa]] was separated between [[Belgium]] ([[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]), Portugal (the [[Kionga Triangle]]) and the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Tanganyika]], later merging with [[Zanzibar]] to form [[Tanzania]]); and [[German South-West Africa]] ([[Namibia]]) becomes a mandate of [[South Africa]].

UV light creates [[electron-hole pair]]s, with the holes reacting with lattice oxygen, creating surface oxygen vacancies, while the electrons reduce V<sup>5+</sup> to V<sup>3+</sup>.

Once again hydrophobicity is induced by interlaminar air pockets (separated by 2.1 [[nanometer|nm]] distances). The UV effect is also explained. UV light creates [[electron-hole pair]]s, with the holes reacting with lattice oxygen, creating surface oxygen vacancies, while the electrons reduce V<sup>5+</sup> to V<sup>3+</sup>. The oxygen vacancies are met by water, and it is this water absorbency by the vanadium surface that makes it hydrophilic.

Each episode centers on an animal that deals with or helps explain the issue Stanley is grappling with.\n\n[[Junkanoo]] and [[reggae fusion]] group [[Baha Men]], known for their hit song \"[[Who Let the Dogs Out?]]\", sang the theme song for the series, \"My Man Stanley\".\n[[Relient K]] later re-recorded the theme song in 2011, as part of [[Disney Junior - Live on Stage!]]\n\n==Synopsis==\nEach episode shows Stanley (voiced by Jessica D. Stone) in a situation he does not fully understand. He discusses it with his pet goldfish Dennis ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]) before consulting the ''Great Big Book of Everything'', a remarkably complete [[zoology]] book aimed at young children or his computer. By observing how an animal copes with the same situation Stanley faces, or how it can overcome a similar difficulty, Stanley learns to deal with the situation himself.\n\nThroughout the show Stanley and all his preschool aged friends are able to talk to his pet cat, Elsie ([[Hynden Walch]]) and dog Harry (Rene Mujica) as well as Dennis. Other animals also seem to occasionally respond, but never talk or give a definite indication they truly understood what was said. Stanley and his friends actively try to keep the adults (that is, except Stanley's grandmother), and by extension Stanley's older brother Lionel, from realizing this.\n\nThe ''Great Big Book of Everything'' appears to be magical in nature, able to either let the animals out of the pages or allow the children to enter, sometimes changing them into animals in the process. This does not appear to be imaginary since occasionally adults do notice the noise, and Stanley works hard to hide the animals. There is also an episode where Stanley's brother sees a whale on the roof but dismisses the memory when it disappears back into the book.\n\nThe [[Halloween]] special features Stanley's grandmother who, it is implied, is a witch. She reveals that she too can work the book, and in fact was the one who gave it to Stanley. She was also the one who taught its theme song to Harry and Elsie.\n\nWhen someone says the \"Great Big Book of Everything\", hints it out, or even has the book, Elsie and Harry will wake up or find their way into the scene and start singing. This usually annoys Dennis, who after the introductory verse, says something like \"Oh not again!\"\n\nThe episodes, \"Growing Pains,\" \"Time for Toolfish,\" and \"Pearls of Wisdom,\" show Harry, Stanley's pet dog, in a swimsuit.\n\n==Characters==\n* Stanley Griff (Jessica D. Stone) is an imaginative young boy. He has three pets: a goldfish named Dennis, a dog named Harry, and a cat named Elsie. He has an older brother named Lionel, who enjoys playing his electric guitar, a father who stays at home and draws cartoons, and a mother who is a dentist (the latter two were revealed in the episode \"Double-Duty Dad\"). \n* Dennis the Goldfish ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]) is the goldfish of Stanley Griff. In fact, he is Stanley's best friend who gives him education about animals to help him with his everyday problems, which interest him. He also has to point out the flaws in Stanley's ridiculous solutions. He even breaks the fourth wall by either encouraging the audience to do something fun or by asking them questions at the end of almost every episode.\n* Lionel Griff ([[Shawn Pyfrom]]) is the older brother of Stanley. He likes rock and roll music a lot and always wears headphones on his ears, but still loves his younger brother very much by giving him advice, helping out with his homework, and looking out for him. He's a [[teenager]].\n* Mark Griff ([[David Landsberg]]) is the father of Stanley and Lionel. He is a stay-at-home father but works anyway as a [[cartoonist]]. He wears glasses, a dark purple short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, has short dark strands of hair and has a beard. \n* Joyce Griff ([[Ari Meyers]]) is the sweet and caring mother of Stanley and Lionel. She works as a [[dentist]] and loves her family very much. However, she does have ophidiophobia, which is the fear of snakes. She has red hair, wears [[jeans]], a green collared short-sleeved shirt, red [[lipstick]] and white shoes. Whether at the pool or the beach, her bathing suit is mostly a two piece bikini style.\n* Lester Goldberg ([[Philece Sampler]]) is one of Stanley's friends. He has a father who is referred to as Mr. Goldberg ([[Wallace Shawn]]) and a mother who is referred to as Mrs. Goldberg ([[Didi Conn]]). In \"Little Dog Lost\", it is revealed that he is Jewish because not only is his last name Goldberg, he does not celebrate [[Christmas]] and he celebrates [[Hanukkah]]. But he gets a present for every one of the 8 nights of the holiday. In the episode Gorilla Sleepover it is revealed that his mom's first name is Nancy. He also has a little sister named Samantha who went to Mrs. Griff for a dental checkup and in the episode \"Tasmanian Tantrum\" she throws [[tantrum]]s when she wants something.\n* Marci & Mimi (Khaylan Jones) are [[African-American]] identical [[twin]] sisters who are very good friends with Stanley. They both have black hair, but Mimi's hair is long with a purple hairbow on the top of her head and Marcie's hair is tied in a ponytail. In \"Little Dog Lost\", it's revealed that they celebrate [[Kwanzaa]].\n* Jane is a [[Chinese-American]] girl that is in Stanley's class. She has pigtails and appears in several episodes. She invites Stanley to her house in \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\".\n* Ben (Aria Noelle) is a boy that wears a hat. He appears in \"Me and My Pal Fish!\" where he takes Stanley's ball. Stanley stands up to him saying that he and Lester make a great time. He makes cameos in other episodes.\n* Teresa Kirby is a girl that appears in the episode \"Shell Game\". She is the same age as Stanley. She gets shy and Stanley doesn't know why Teresa's shy. Later on, Stanley apologizes and him and Teresa were great friends. She has a pet turtle (Because Stanley and Dennis learned about turtles in this episode).\n* Unnamed Female Student is an unnamed orange-haired girl that is in Stanley's class. She makes cameos in the episodes where Stanley is in class. She has speaking appearances in In a While Crocodile, Save the Bluebird, and Dances with Flamingos. She has orange pigtails, glasses, blue dress, and purple high heels. \n* Fox is an animal that appears in the episode \"Watch Out for Lionels\" and \"Outfoxing Lionel\". It barks out loud at the armadillo, who then rolls up into a ball. In the episode \"Outfoxing Lionel\", the fox was the primary source of this episode.\n\n==Cast==\n* Jessica D.

(Animal Topic: [[Kangaroo]])\n\n2. \"Daddy Pride / Show-and-Tell Shark\"\n* Stanley is upset that his Daddy often has to stop playing with him to go to work. He decides that maybe he should get an animal to be his Daddy -- perhaps a lion. Worried that this may not be the best idea, Dennis urges him to consult The Great Big Book of Everything.

(Animal Topic: [[Lion]])\n* Stanley has an assignment to bring a really cool animal to show off at show-and-tell. Dennis is excited by the project, until he hears some of Stanley's wild ideas of what he's going to bring. He considers a Tyrannosaurus Rex and an elephant before finally decided on a shark.

Now's the time to go in The Great Big Book of Everything! From there, Stanley studies armadillos, armor-plated champions of defense!!!!!!

(Animal Topic: [[Armadillo]])\n* Stanley does not want a new bed, but his parents want him to get a new bed at the mattress store.

Stanley decides to find out more about this animal by hopping into The Great Big Book of Everything. (Animal Topic: [[Frog]])\n* Stanley and his pets all want to get to sleep, but Stanley keeps hearing mysterious noises. His mom assures him that there is nothing to be afraid of, but Stanley remains convinced that he's hearing a scary monster. He knows that owls can see in the dark and wonders how they do it. He seeks the answer in The Great Big Book of Everything in the hope that it will help him to spot the monster so everyone can finally get some sleep.

When Stanley loses the game of hide-and-seek, he realizes he's going to need to learn more about tigers, and by association, cats, in order to figure out the best way to locate Elsie. (Animal Topic: [[Tiger]])\n* Stanley has been training hard for the upcoming school field day, but there's one event that he can't seem to master -- the monkey bars.

He decides to look up deserts in The Great Big Book of Everything and learns about camels in the process. (Animal Topic: [[Camel]])\n* Stanley heads out one morning to play with Mimi and Marci in the snow, but doesn't put on his snowsuit because he feels it's too bulky.

He's been working hard on the show and really wants to put on a great show all by himself. His friends are rather upset when he tells them that he doesn't want any help whatsoever. Then, he hears that the party is starting early, and it looks like he isn't going to have is show ready on time. He decides that perhaps he could learn from an octopus how to get many things done at once, since they have eight arms.

He doesn't know how to tell Marci that he's lost it and is afraid that he will lose her friendship. Instead of telling her, he decides to run and hide.

When Playhouse Disney rebranded its on-air presentation in 2007, ''Stanley'' was put on a new timeslot at 6:00 AM ET on the weekdays. As of May 2008, ''Stanley'' no longer airs on Playhouse Disney, but DVDs and books are still available. In February 2011, the show was completely removed when Playhouse Disney rebranded as [[Disney Junior]]. The show was briefly seen online on DisneyJunior.com as part of \"fan favorites\" week on the week of June 20, 2011. From March 23, 2012 to September 3, 2013, the series returned on the U.S. airwaves on [[Disney Junior]].\n\nIn Canada, it ran on The Family Channel from 2002 to 2007 and then was moved to Disney Junior, which has been running since 2007. It also aired on the Canadian-French version of Disney Junior since 2010.\n\n===Canada===\n*[[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family (Canada)]] (2002 - November 29, 2007)\n*[[Family Jr.|Disney Junior (English Canada)]] (May 6, 2011 - September 29, 2013)\n*[[T\u00e9l\u00e9magino|Disney Junior (French Canada)]] (May 6, 2011 - 2015)\n*[[Family Jr.|Playhouse Disney (English Canada)]] (November 30, 2007 - May 5, 2011)\n*[[T\u00e9l\u00e9magino|Playhouse Disney (French Canada)]] (July 5, 2010 - May 5, 2011)\n\n===United States===\n*[[Disney Channel]] ([[Playhouse Disney]]) (September 15, 2001 - May 16, 2008) \n*[[Disney Junior]] (March 23, 2012 - September 3, 2013)\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n'''[[Daytime Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]]'''\n*[[29th Daytime Emmy Awards|2002]] \u2013 ''[[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer In An Animated Program|Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program]]'' \u2013 [[Charles Shaughnessy]] for playing \"Dennis\" (won)\n\n==Film==\nOn January 3, 2006, [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] and [[Cartoon Pizza]] released a full-length [[direct-to-video]] movie based on ''Stanley''.

Each episode centers on an animal that deals with or helps explain the issue Stanley is grappling with.\n\n[[Junkanoo]] and [[reggae fusion]] group [[Baha Men]], known for their hit song \"[[Who Let the Dogs Out?]]\", sang the theme song for the series, \"My Man Stanley\".\n[[Relient K]] later re-recorded the theme song in 2011, as part of [[Disney Junior - Live on Stage!]]\n\n==Synopsis==\nEach episode shows Stanley (voiced by Jessica D. Stone) in a situation he does not fully understand. He discusses it with his pet goldfish Dennis ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]) before consulting the ''Great Big Book of Everything'', a remarkably complete [[zoology]] book aimed at young children or his computer. By observing how an animal copes with the same situation Stanley faces, or how it can overcome a similar difficulty, Stanley learns to deal with the situation himself.\n\nThroughout the show Stanley and all his preschool aged friends are able to talk to his pet cat, Elsie ([[Hynden Walch]]) and dog Harry (Rene Mujica) as well as Dennis. Other animals also seem to occasionally respond, but never talk or give a definite indication they truly understood what was said. Stanley and his friends actively try to keep the adults (that is, except Stanley's grandmother), and by extension Stanley's older brother Lionel, from realizing this.\n\nThe ''Great Big Book of Everything'' appears to be magical in nature, able to either let the animals out of the pages or allow the children to enter, sometimes changing them into animals in the process. This does not appear to be imaginary since occasionally adults do notice the noise, and Stanley works hard to hide the animals. There is also an episode where Stanley's brother sees a whale on the roof but dismisses the memory when it disappears back into the book.\n\nThe [[Halloween]] special features Stanley's grandmother who, it is implied, is a witch. She reveals that she too can work the book, and in fact was the one who gave it to Stanley. She was also the one who taught its theme song to Harry and Elsie.\n\nWhen someone says the \"Great Big Book of Everything\", hints it out, or even has the book, Elsie and Harry will wake up or find their way into the scene and start singing. This usually annoys Dennis, who after the introductory verse, says something like \"Oh not again!\"\n\nThe episodes, \"Growing Pains,\" \"Time for Toolfish,\" and \"Pearls of Wisdom,\" show Harry, Stanley's pet dog, in a swimsuit.\n\n==Characters==\n* Stanley Griff (Jessica D. Stone) is an imaginative young boy. He has three pets: a goldfish named Dennis, a dog named Harry, and a cat named Elsie. He has an older brother named Lionel, who enjoys playing his electric guitar, a father who stays at home and draws cartoons, and a mother who is a dentist (the latter two were revealed in the episode \"Double-Duty Dad\"). \n* Dennis the Goldfish ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]) is the goldfish of Stanley Griff. In fact, he is Stanley's best friend who gives him education about animals to help him with his everyday problems, which interest him. He also has to point out the flaws in Stanley's ridiculous solutions. He even breaks the fourth wall by either encouraging the audience to do something fun or by asking them questions at the end of almost every episode.\n* Lionel Griff ([[Shawn Pyfrom]]) is the older brother of Stanley. He likes rock and roll music a lot and always wears headphones on his ears, but still loves his younger brother very much by giving him advice, helping out with his homework, and looking out for him. He's a [[teenager]].\n* Mark Griff ([[David Landsberg]]) is the father of Stanley and Lionel. He is a stay-at-home father but works anyway as a [[cartoonist]]. He wears glasses, a dark purple short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, has short dark strands of hair and has a beard. \n* Joyce Griff ([[Ari Meyers]]) is the sweet and caring mother of Stanley and Lionel. She works as a [[dentist]] and loves her family very much. However, she does have ophidiophobia, which is the fear of snakes. She has red hair, wears [[jeans]], a green collared short-sleeved shirt, red [[lipstick]] and white shoes. Whether at the pool or the beach, her bathing suit is mostly a two piece bikini style.\n* Lester Goldberg ([[Philece Sampler]]) is one of Stanley's friends. He has a father who is referred to as Mr. Goldberg ([[Wallace Shawn]]) and a mother who is referred to as Mrs. Goldberg ([[Didi Conn]]). In \"Little Dog Lost\", it is revealed that he is Jewish because not only is his last name Goldberg, he does not celebrate [[Christmas]] and he celebrates [[Hanukkah]]. But he gets a present for every one of the 8 nights of the holiday. In the episode Gorilla Sleepover it is revealed that his mom's first name is Nancy. He also has a little sister named Samantha who went to Mrs. Griff for a dental checkup and in the episode \"Tasmanian Tantrum\" she throws [[tantrum]]s when she wants something.\n* Marci & Mimi (Khaylan Jones) are [[African-American]] identical [[twin]] sisters who are very good friends with Stanley. They both have black hair, but Mimi's hair is long with a purple hairbow on the top of her head and Marcie's hair is tied in a ponytail. In \"Little Dog Lost\", it's revealed that they celebrate [[Kwanzaa]].\n* Jane is a [[Chinese-American]] girl that is in Stanley's class. She has pigtails and appears in several episodes. She invites Stanley to her house in \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\".\n* Ben (Aria Noelle) is a boy that wears a hat. He appears in \"Me and My Pal Fish!\" where he takes Stanley's ball. Stanley stands up to him saying that he and Lester make a great time. He makes cameos in other episodes.\n* Teresa Kirby is a girl that appears in the episode \"Shell Game\". She is the same age as Stanley. She gets shy and Stanley doesn't know why Teresa's shy. Later on, Stanley apologizes and him and Teresa were great friends. She has a pet turtle (Because Stanley and Dennis learned about turtles in this episode).\n* Unnamed Female Student is an unnamed orange-haired girl that is in Stanley's class. She makes cameos in the episodes where Stanley is in class. She has speaking appearances in In a While Crocodile, Save the Bluebird, and Dances with Flamingos. She has orange pigtails, glasses, blue dress, and purple high heels. \n* Fox is an animal that appears in the episode \"Watch Out for Lionels\" and \"Outfoxing Lionel\". It barks out loud at the armadillo, who then rolls up into a ball. In the episode \"Outfoxing Lionel\", the fox was the primary source of this episode.\n\n==Cast==\n* Jessica D.

It seems Stanley's completely forgotten his mother's birthday and now he's in serious need of a present. He knows that she likes apples, but has trouble getting one down from a tree. He decides to summon a giraffe from The Great Big Book of Everything for help. (Animal Topic: [[Giraffe]])\n* When Stanley messes up his parents room, they declare that he'll have no dessert unless he cleans it up. Stanley doesn't want to miss out on banana whammy, but doesn't know how he can possibly clean up the giant mess he's created. Thinking he can get an animal to do it for him, he looks up kangaroos in The Great Big Book of Everything. He discovers some important facts about kangaroos and also stumbles upon an idea for cleaning. (Animal Topic: [[Kangaroo]])\n\n2. \"Daddy Pride / Show-and-Tell Shark\"\n* Stanley is upset that his Daddy often has to stop playing with him to go to work. He decides that maybe he should get an animal to be his Daddy -- perhaps a lion. Worried that this may not be the best idea, Dennis urges him to consult The Great Big Book of Everything. Stanley learns that when it comes to lions, playing is serious business, and a lion may not be well-suited to be his father. (Animal Topic: [[Lion]])\n* Stanley has an assignment to bring a really cool animal to show off at show-and-tell. Dennis is excited by the project, until he hears some of Stanley's wild ideas of what he's going to bring. He considers a Tyrannosaurus Rex and an elephant before finally decided on a shark. Stanley, learns, however, that he's neither well-equipped to care for a shark, nor are sharks really the right temperament for animal to bring to school. (Animal Topoc: [[Great White Shark]])\n\n3. \"Bearly Awake / The Eagle Has Landed\"\n* Stanley doesn't get enough sleep, and eventually sleeps in school. Stanley then gets tired when Lionel tells a joke involving \"7 ate 9\" at dinner time where the Griffs are having spaghetti. Stanley doesn't want to sleep at night, so he learns about bears in the Great Big Book of Everything, and learns about why sleep is very important. (Animal Topic: [[Grizzly bear]])\n*  Stanley builds a kite for a contest, but he needs a little help. So Stanley learns about eagles in The Great Big Book of Everything. (Animal Topic: [[Bald eagle]])\n\n4. \"Watch Out for Lionels / Growing Pains\"\n* Stanley is so sick and tired of Lionel always pestering him around. This happens almost like all the time the following day, but Stanley is very mad and frustrated at Lionel. What can Stanley do, so that Lionel will stop bugging him? Now's the time to go in The Great Big Book of Everything! From there, Stanley studies armadillos, armor-plated champions of defense!!!!!! For example, an armadillo rolled into a ball, because it was scared by a fox barking at it, Stanley then gets the idea to then ignore it. (Animal Topic: [[Armadillo]])\n* Stanley does not want a new bed, but his parents want him to get a new bed at the mattress store. Stanley then goes into The Great Big Book of Everything to learn about crabs, and why crabs grow, they need more space for their new home!!! (Animal Topic: [[Crab]])\n\n5. \"Frog Legs / Whoo's Afraid of the Dark?\"\n* Stanley is less-than-excited when he learns that he's finally old enough to join his family in the big pool. In fact, he doesn't want to admit it, but he's a bit scared. When he states that humans are meant to stay on land, Dennis mentions an animal that copes quite well on both land and water-- the frog. Stanley decides to find out more about this animal by hopping into The Great Big Book of Everything. (Animal Topic: [[Frog]])\n* Stanley and his pets all want to get to sleep, but Stanley keeps hearing mysterious noises. His mom assures him that there is nothing to be afraid of, but Stanley remains convinced that he's hearing a scary monster. He knows that owls can see in the dark and wonders how they do it. He seeks the answer in The Great Big Book of Everything in the hope that it will help him to spot the monster so everyone can finally get some sleep. (Animal Topic: [[Owl]])\n\n6. \"Tiger Hunt / Monkey Bar Business\"\n* When Stanley's family gets tired of him taking pictures of them, they encourage him to find something else to take pictures of. Stanley decides to play a hide-and-seek game with Elsie and takes pictures of her, but wants her to dress up in his old set of tiger pajamas. Elsie, proud of her fur, reluctantly agrees, but then goes off for a cat nap behind the furnace where Stanley can't find her. When Stanley loses the game of hide-and-seek, he realizes he's going to need to learn more about tigers, and by association, cats, in order to figure out the best way to locate Elsie.

It is equivalent to the [[naval]] & Coast Guard rank of [[Captain (United States O-6)|captain]] in the other [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]].{{NoteTag|The other United States uniformed services include the [[United States Navy]], [[United States Coast Guard]], and the commissioned corps of the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] and [[United States Public Health Service]].}}  By law, a colonel must have at least 22 years of cumulative service and a minimum of three years as a lieutenant colonel before being promoted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.military-ranks.org/air-force/colonel|title=Air Force Colonel |publisher=www.military-ranks.org|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref>  The [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades|pay grade]] for colonel is O-6.\n\nWhen worn alone, the insignia of rank seen at right is worn centered on headgear and fatigue uniforms. When worn in pairs, the insignia is worn on the officer's left side while a mirror-image reverse version is worn on the right side, such that both of the eagles faces forward to the wearer's front.\n\n==Insignia==\n[[File:Colonel William Few.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Few]] in the uniform of a Continental Army colonel]]\n\nThe insignia for a colonel is a [[silver]] [[eagle]] which is a stylized representation of the eagle dominating the [[Great Seal of the United States]] (which is the [[coat of arms]] of the United States). As on the Great Seal, the eagle has a U.S. shield superimposed on its chest and is holding an [[olive branch]] and bundle of [[arrow]]s in its [[Talon (anatomy)|talons]]. However, in simplification of the Great Seal image, the insignia lacks the scroll in the eagle's mouth and the [[Rosette (design)|rosette]] above its head. On the Great Seal, the olive branch is always clutched in the eagle's right-side talons, while the bundle of arrows is always clutched in the left-side talons. The head of the eagle faces towards the olive branch, rather than the arrows, advocating peace rather than war. As a result, the head of the eagle always faces towards the viewer's left.\n\nHowever, when worn as a single insignia with no matching pair, such as on the [[patrol cap]], [[garrison cap]]/[[flight cap]], or the front of the Army ACU, there is a split between the services on which mirror image of the eagle should be worn. In the United States Army and United States Air Force, the eagle is always worn with \"the head of the eagle to the wearer's right,\" with the olive branch clutched in the eagle's right hand talons (see Department of the Army Pamphlet 670-1, paragraph 19-6 (a)(1)). In the United States Marine Corps, United States Navy, United States Coast Guard and NOAA, the eagle is worn with \"the head facing forward\" on the wearer's right side of the garrison cover (see Marine Corps Order P1020.34G, Uniform Regulation, paragraph 4005d(1)). Since respective service's officer insignia is worn on the left side and the rank insignia is worn on the right hand side of the Marine, Navy, Coast Guard and NOAA garrison caps, the eagle is facing to the eagle's left with the olive branch clutched in the eagle's left hand talons, which is a mirror opposite to the wear of the single eagle for Army and Air Force officers.\n\n==Origins==\nThe United States rank of colonel is a direct successor to the [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|same rank]] in the [[British Army]]. The first colonels in the U.S. were appointed from [[Colonialism|Colonial]] [[militia]]s maintained as [[Military reserve force|reserves]] to the British Army in the North American colonies. Upon the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]], colonial legislatures would grant commissions to men to raise a [[regiment]] and serve as its colonel. Thus, the first U.S. colonels were usually respected men with ties in local communities and active in politics.\n\nWith the post-war reduction of the U.S. Army, the rank of colonel disappeared, and was not re-introduced until 1802.\n\nThe first insignia for the rank of colonel consisted of gold [[epaulette]]s worn on the blue uniform of the [[Continental Army]]. The first recorded use of the eagle insignia was in 1805 as this insignia was made official in uniform regulations by 1810.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:UCWColonel.jpg|thumb|upright|A shoulder strap from an infantry colonel in the Union Army]]\n[[File:Union Army colonel rank insignia.png|thumb|upright|A shoulder strap from an infantry colonel in the Union Army]]\nThe rank of colonel was relatively rare in the early 19th century, partly because the U.S. Army was very small, and the rank was usually obtained only after long years of service. During the [[War of 1812]] the Army grew rapidly and many colonels were appointed, but most of these colonels were discharged when their regiments were disbanded at the war's conclusion. A number of other colonels were appointed by brevet - an honorary promotion usually for distinguished service in combat.\n\nThe [[American Civil War]] saw a large influx of colonels as the rank was commonly held in both the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] and [[Union Army]] by those who commanded a regiment. Since most regiments were state formations and were quickly raised, the colonels in command of the regiments were known by the title \"Colonel of Volunteers,\" in contrast to [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] colonels who held permanent commissions.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the Confederate Army maintained a unique insignia for colonel, three stars worn on the collar of a uniform. [[Robert E. Lee]] wore this insignia due to his former rank in the United States Army and refused to wear the [[Ranks and insignia of the Confederate States|insignia of a Confederate general]], stating that he would only accept permanent promotion when the South had achieved independence.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the rank of colonel again became rare as the forces of the United States Army became extremely small. However, many colonels were appointed in the volunteers during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], prominent among them [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[David Grant Colson]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==20th century==\n[[File:WheelerClement1965Vietnam.jpg|thumb|left|A U.S. Marine colonel (center) during the Vietnam War.]]\n[[File:Sustad JI.jpg|thumb|Colonel [[Jeanette Sustad]] as Director of Women Marines.]]\n\n[[World War I]] and [[World War II]] saw the largest numbers of colonels ever appointed in the U.S. military. This was mostly due to the temporary ranks of the [[History of the United States Army#World War I|National Army]] and the [[Army of the United States]], where those who would normally hold the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] in the peacetime Regular Army were thrust into the rank of colonel during these two wars.\n\nThe Military Promotion System was revised and standardized for all the services in 1980 as a result of passage of the [[Defense Officer Personnel Management Act]].\n\n==21st century==\nModern U.S. colonels usually command Army infantry, artillery, armor, aviation or other types of [[brigade]]s, USMC [[regiment]]s, [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s or Marine Aircraft Groups, and USAF [[Group (air force unit)|groups]] or [[wing (air force unit)|wing]]s. An Army colonel typically commands brigade-sized units (4,000 to 6,000 soldiers), with another colonel or a lieutenant colonel as deputy commander, a major as [[executive officer]], and a [[command sergeant major]] as a senior [[non-commissioned officer]] (NCO) advisor. An Air Force colonel typically commands a [[wing (air force unit)|wing]] consisting of 1,000 to 4,000+ airmen with another colonel as the vice commander and a [[Chief master sergeant#Command Chief Master Sergeant|Command Chief Master Sergeant]] as principal senior NCO enlisted adviser. Some USAF colonels are commanders of [[Group (air force)|groups]], which are the four major components of wings. Colonels are also found as the chief of staff at divisional level-(Army) or [[Numbered Air Force]]-level staff agencies.\n\nIn the modern armed forces, the colonel's eagle is worn facing forward with head and beak pointing towards the wearer's front. Of all U.S. military commissioned officer rank, only the colonel's eagle has a distinct right and left insignia.

When worn in pairs, the insignia is worn on the officer's left side while a mirror-image reverse version is worn on the right side, such that both of the eagles faces forward to the wearer's front.\n\n==Insignia==\n[[File:Colonel William Few.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Few]] in the uniform of a Continental Army colonel]]\n\nThe insignia for a colonel is a [[silver]] [[eagle]] which is a stylized representation of the eagle dominating the [[Great Seal of the United States]] (which is the [[coat of arms]] of the United States). As on the Great Seal, the eagle has a U.S. shield superimposed on its chest and is holding an [[olive branch]] and bundle of [[arrow]]s in its [[Talon (anatomy)|talons]]. However, in simplification of the Great Seal image, the insignia lacks the scroll in the eagle's mouth and the [[Rosette (design)|rosette]] above its head. On the Great Seal, the olive branch is always clutched in the eagle's right-side talons, while the bundle of arrows is always clutched in the left-side talons. The head of the eagle faces towards the olive branch, rather than the arrows, advocating peace rather than war. As a result, the head of the eagle always faces towards the viewer's left.\n\nHowever, when worn as a single insignia with no matching pair, such as on the [[patrol cap]], [[garrison cap]]/[[flight cap]], or the front of the Army ACU, there is a split between the services on which mirror image of the eagle should be worn. In the United States Army and United States Air Force, the eagle is always worn with \"the head of the eagle to the wearer's right,\" with the olive branch clutched in the eagle's right hand talons (see Department of the Army Pamphlet 670-1, paragraph 19-6 (a)(1)). In the United States Marine Corps, United States Navy, United States Coast Guard and NOAA, the eagle is worn with \"the head facing forward\" on the wearer's right side of the garrison cover (see Marine Corps Order P1020.34G, Uniform Regulation, paragraph 4005d(1)). Since respective service's officer insignia is worn on the left side and the rank insignia is worn on the right hand side of the Marine, Navy, Coast Guard and NOAA garrison caps, the eagle is facing to the eagle's left with the olive branch clutched in the eagle's left hand talons, which is a mirror opposite to the wear of the single eagle for Army and Air Force officers.\n\n==Origins==\nThe United States rank of colonel is a direct successor to the [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|same rank]] in the [[British Army]]. The first colonels in the U.S. were appointed from [[Colonialism|Colonial]] [[militia]]s maintained as [[Military reserve force|reserves]] to the British Army in the North American colonies. Upon the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]], colonial legislatures would grant commissions to men to raise a [[regiment]] and serve as its colonel. Thus, the first U.S. colonels were usually respected men with ties in local communities and active in politics.\n\nWith the post-war reduction of the U.S. Army, the rank of colonel disappeared, and was not re-introduced until 1802.\n\nThe first insignia for the rank of colonel consisted of gold [[epaulette]]s worn on the blue uniform of the [[Continental Army]]. The first recorded use of the eagle insignia was in 1805 as this insignia was made official in uniform regulations by 1810.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==19th century==\n[[File:UCWColonel.jpg|thumb|upright|A shoulder strap from an infantry colonel in the Union Army]]\n[[File:Union Army colonel rank insignia.png|thumb|upright|A shoulder strap from an infantry colonel in the Union Army]]\nThe rank of colonel was relatively rare in the early 19th century, partly because the U.S. Army was very small, and the rank was usually obtained only after long years of service. During the [[War of 1812]] the Army grew rapidly and many colonels were appointed, but most of these colonels were discharged when their regiments were disbanded at the war's conclusion. A number of other colonels were appointed by brevet - an honorary promotion usually for distinguished service in combat.\n\nThe [[American Civil War]] saw a large influx of colonels as the rank was commonly held in both the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate army]] and [[Union Army]] by those who commanded a regiment. Since most regiments were state formations and were quickly raised, the colonels in command of the regiments were known by the title \"Colonel of Volunteers,\" in contrast to [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] colonels who held permanent commissions.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the Confederate Army maintained a unique insignia for colonel, three stars worn on the collar of a uniform. [[Robert E. Lee]] wore this insignia due to his former rank in the United States Army and refused to wear the [[Ranks and insignia of the Confederate States|insignia of a Confederate general]], stating that he would only accept permanent promotion when the South had achieved independence.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the rank of colonel again became rare as the forces of the United States Army became extremely small. However, many colonels were appointed in the volunteers during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], prominent among them [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[David Grant Colson]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==20th century==\n[[File:WheelerClement1965Vietnam.jpg|thumb|left|A U.S. Marine colonel (center) during the Vietnam War.]]\n[[File:Sustad JI.jpg|thumb|Colonel [[Jeanette Sustad]] as Director of Women Marines.]]\n\n[[World War I]] and [[World War II]] saw the largest numbers of colonels ever appointed in the U.S. military. This was mostly due to the temporary ranks of the [[History of the United States Army#World War I|National Army]] and the [[Army of the United States]], where those who would normally hold the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] in the peacetime Regular Army were thrust into the rank of colonel during these two wars.\n\nThe Military Promotion System was revised and standardized for all the services in 1980 as a result of passage of the [[Defense Officer Personnel Management Act]].\n\n==21st century==\nModern U.S. colonels usually command Army infantry, artillery, armor, aviation or other types of [[brigade]]s, USMC [[regiment]]s, [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s or Marine Aircraft Groups, and USAF [[Group (air force unit)|groups]] or [[wing (air force unit)|wing]]s. An Army colonel typically commands brigade-sized units (4,000 to 6,000 soldiers), with another colonel or a lieutenant colonel as deputy commander, a major as [[executive officer]], and a [[command sergeant major]] as a senior [[non-commissioned officer]] (NCO) advisor. An Air Force colonel typically commands a [[wing (air force unit)|wing]] consisting of 1,000 to 4,000+ airmen with another colonel as the vice commander and a [[Chief master sergeant#Command Chief Master Sergeant|Command Chief Master Sergeant]] as principal senior NCO enlisted adviser. Some USAF colonels are commanders of [[Group (air force)|groups]], which are the four major components of wings. Colonels are also found as the chief of staff at divisional level-(Army) or [[Numbered Air Force]]-level staff agencies.\n\nIn the modern armed forces, the colonel's eagle is worn facing forward with head and beak pointing towards the wearer's front. Of all U.S. military commissioned officer rank, only the colonel's eagle has a distinct right and left insignia. All other commissioned officer rank insignia can be worn on either the right or left side.\n\nColonels are sometimes referred to (but not addressed as) '''full colonels''', '''bird colonels''', or '''full bird colonels''' because lieutenant colonels are also referred to and addressed in correspondence as \"colonel.\" Referring to an \"O-6\", a colonel's pay grade, also may differentiate colonels and [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonels]], who have a pay grade of \"O-5\".\n\nAlmost all Army colonels have attended a war college or a senior staff college equivalent to study joint warfare and war itself.

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=314 562 846-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

Jackson wrote further lyrics for the song during the same night Jam came up with the melody alongside drum programmer Alex Richburg.

Two different choruses were written by Jam and Jackson; Jam wrote \"Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you\" while Jackson wrote \"Doesn't really matter\". They decided to use Jackson's chorus, and include Jam's chorus towards the end of the track. Jackson presented three songs to Segal on May 12, 2000, three days prior to his set deadline for the soundtrack. He chose \"Doesn't Really Matter\", believing it was a better fit and a \"summertime record\".

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=314 562 846-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

Jackson wrote further lyrics for the song during the same night Jam came up with the melody alongside drum programmer Alex Richburg. Initially conceived as a \"slow melody\", Jam chose to increase its [[tempo]]. Two different choruses were written by Jam and Jackson; Jam wrote \"Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you\" while Jackson wrote \"Doesn't really matter\". They decided to use Jackson's chorus, and include Jam's chorus towards the end of the track. Jackson presented three songs to Segal on May 12, 2000, three days prior to his set deadline for the soundtrack. He chose \"Doesn't Really Matter\", believing it was a better fit and a \"summertime record\". A slightly modified version was included on ''All for You'', featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's [[Rockwilder]] remix.<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\n==Composition==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" is lyrically inspired by Jackson's character in the film, who falls in love with Klump. According to Jackson, the lyrics are about Gaines' love for Klump and \"how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior\",<ref name=\"Making\" /> with Jam stating that it is about what counts on the inside.<ref name=\"MTV\" /> The song has an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] sound, which is inspired by [[Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs]]' digital [[funk]] production used in the discographies of [[TLC (group)|TLC]] and [[Destiny's Child]].<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> The track begins with a twenty-second \"breathy, mid-paced intro\", before transitioning into a \"spacious, electronic R&B club track\".<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> The dynamics also fluctuate, from stop-start verses leading to a double [[tempo]] chorus, to the mid-point breakdown eventually ending with the song's rapid conclusion.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described \"Doesn't Really Matter\" as [[Burt Bacharach|Bacharachian]] with \"bells and whistles in the production\" and noted Jackson's \"falsetto trill\" on the lyrics \"My love / For you / Is unconditional too\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20267962,00.html|title=Now That's What I Call Music! 5|last=Farber|first=Jim|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 17, 2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1226514,00.html|title=Chart Flashback|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Pastorek|first=Whitney|date=August 15, 2006|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> The magazine also pointed out the [[Half-time (music)|half-time]], [[Stutter edit|stutter-beat]] verse to the sung chorus,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=All for You Review|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Sinclair|first=Tom|date=May 4, 2001}}</ref> which is complimented by the track's \"minimal percussive programming\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/janet-jackson-all-for-you/94|title=Janet Jackson: All for You \u2013 Music Review|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|date=June 13, 2001|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[AllMusic]] called it an \"instant smash\" and \"impossibly catchy\", adding that the, \"public's appetite for Janet Jackson never wanes.\" Despite being \"the first new offering from Ms. Jackson in years,\" the song was thought to have \"the feel and sound of a young, girlish, naive Janet singing a happy pop song about love as opposed to the hardened, sexually experimental Janet who emerged during the later ''Velvet Rope'' years.\" The \"definitive\" song was qualified as \"classic pop Janet through and through\" and an \"essential\" hit.<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/doesnt-really-matter-us-cd5-cassette-mw0000101400 |title=Doesn't Really Matter [US CD5/Cassette]|work=[[AllMusic]] |last=Promis|first=Jose F. |date=August 8, 2000 |access-date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] commended the song for maintaining Jackson and her producers reputations as the \"leading lights of contemporary urban soul.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/all-for-you-mw0000017729 |title=All for You \u2013 Janet Jackson|work=[[AllMusic]] |last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas |date=April 24, 2001 |access-date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> AllMusic also reviewed several of the song's remixes, citing the \"[[Jonathan Peters]] Club Mix\" as the most superior; transforming the original into a \"summery, breezy dance record, complete with Spanish guitars and whistles.\" The review added \"The song lends itself surprisingly well to this transformation, and, with great instrumentation, results in a pleasant and effortless dance record.\" Rockwilder's \"Dance All Day Extended Mix\" was described as possessing a melodic [[hip-hop]] and \"[[dancehall]] flavor\", though was considered to lack the original's vibrancy.

The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the television programs, was established by [[Crossover (fiction)|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed eight films, with a multitude of other planned films in various stages of development. It is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|eleventh-highest-grossing film franchise]] of all time, having grossed over $5.48 billion at the global box office. Its highest-grossing film is ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'', which earned over $1.15 billion worldwide, becoming the [[List of films based on DC Comics publications|highest-grossing DC film]] to date.\n\nThe films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] casts. [[Henry Cavill]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]] and [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], among others, star in several films. However, unlike the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the franchise has non-linear, loosely connected storylines, with greater autonomy for the filmmakers who create each individual film. The first film in the DCEU was ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013), followed by ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018), ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' (2019), and ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020). The franchise will continue with ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' in 2020, ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'', ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'', and ''Black Adam'' in 2021; and ''Shazam! 2'', ''The Flash'' and ''Aquaman 2'' in 2022.\n\n== Development ==\nIn 2002, [[Wolfgang Petersen]] was set to direct a ''[[Superman in film#Batman vs. Superman (2001\u20132002)|Batman vs. Superman]]'' film from a script by [[Akiva Goldsman]].<ref name=\"BvSNewsweek\"/> Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after [[J.

Several television series featuring DC characters and storylines have their own shared continuity, frequently referred to as the [[Arrowverse]].<ref name=\"Arrowverse\"/> DC's [[chief creative officer]] [[Geoff Johns]] explained DC's difference in approach to [[Marvel Studios]] and their cinematic universe, saying, \"We look at it as the [[multiverse]]. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach.\"<ref name=\"GoeffJonesBuzzFeed\"/> In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman expanded on DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, \"We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other.

Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them.\"<ref name=\"RethinkVulture\"/>\n\nIn January 2018, [[Walter Hamada]] was appointed the President of DC Films and co-runner of the DCEU, replacing Berg.<ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> The following month, Chantal Nong was named Vice President of DC Films.<ref name=\"ChantalNongVP\"/> The pair were hired to oversee the franchise with Johns, as the key production team managers.<ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> However, Johns stepped down from his executive roles at DC in June 2018.

with the naming convention of the already established [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"DCMarvelForbes\"/><ref name=\"DCCUYahoo\"/><ref name=\"DCCU-EW\"/> Keith Staskiewicz, writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', coined the term \"DC Extended Universe\u2122\" as a joke in an article of his about ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' on July 1, 2015.<ref name=\"DCEU-EW\"/><ref name=\"DCEU-SR\"/> This term and the abbreviation DCEU quickly spread among the press and fans thinking of it as the official name of the franchise over the following years.<ref name=\"TheyAreLegend\"/><ref name=\"BvSEmpireCover\"/> According to ''[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]'' writer Abraham Riesman, DC confirmed to him in September 2017 that the term is not used internally and they do not consider it official.<ref name=\"DCEU-SR\"/> In 2016, as part of ''DC Films Presents: Dawn of the Justice League'', both Geoff Johns and [[Kevin Smith]] referred to the franchise's name as being the \"Justice League Universe\".<ref name=\"JLU-SR\"/> During the [[DC Films]] panel at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2018, a video banner displayed the words \"Welcome to the Worlds of DC\", after showcasing some upcoming films. As a result, some media outlets interpreted this as DC officially naming their shared film universe as the \"Worlds of DC\".<ref name=\"WoDC-SR\"/><ref name=\"WoDCForbes\"/> Despite this, there has been no official announcement from Warner Bros. nor DC Films to confirm this.}} is an unofficial term used to refer to an American [[media franchise]] and [[shared universe]] that is centered on a [[film series|series]] of [[superhero film]]s, distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]]. The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the television programs, was established by [[Crossover (fiction)|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed eight films, with a multitude of other planned films in various stages of development. It is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|eleventh-highest-grossing film franchise]] of all time, having grossed over $5.48 billion at the global box office. Its highest-grossing film is ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'', which earned over $1.15 billion worldwide, becoming the [[List of films based on DC Comics publications|highest-grossing DC film]] to date.\n\nThe films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] casts. [[Henry Cavill]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]] and [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], among others, star in several films. However, unlike the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the franchise has non-linear, loosely connected storylines, with greater autonomy for the filmmakers who create each individual film. The first film in the DCEU was ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013), followed by ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018), ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' (2019), and ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020). The franchise will continue with ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' in 2020, ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'', ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'', and ''Black Adam'' in 2021; and ''Shazam! 2'', ''The Flash'' and ''Aquaman 2'' in 2022.\n\n== Development ==\nIn 2002, [[Wolfgang Petersen]] was set to direct a ''[[Superman in film#Batman vs. Superman (2001\u20132002)|Batman vs. Superman]]'' film from a script by [[Akiva Goldsman]].<ref name=\"BvSNewsweek\"/> Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after [[J. J. Abrams]] submitted another draft for ''Superman: Flyby''.<ref name=\"DevelopmentHell\"/><ref name=\"BalePetersenMTV\"/> In February 2007, Warner Bros. hired husband and wife duo Michele and [[Kieran Mulroney]] to write a script for a ''[[Justice League]]'' film.<ref name=\"JusticeVariety2007\"/> [[Christian Bale]], who starred as Batman in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), was not approached to reprise the role,<ref name=\"BaleJusticeLeague\"/> nor was [[Brandon Routh]], who starred as Superman in ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"RouthJusticeLeague\"/> [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] was hired to direct the film,<ref name=\"MillerVariety\"/> reportedly titled ''Justice League Mortal'',<ref name=\"JLMortalVariety\"/> with [[Armie Hammer]] cast as Batman, [[D.

Goyer]] would be returning for a sequel, which was being fast-tracked by Warner Bros.<ref name=\"GoyerMoSSequel\"/> In July, at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], it was revealed that the sequel would include Batman in a main role, establishing the shared universe.<ref name=\"LATimesCC2013\"/><ref name=\"EWCC2013\"/> In October 2014, Warner Bros. announced a slate of ten DC films.<ref name=\"2014Slate\"/>\n\n[[File:Geoff Johns by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|Geoff Johns has served in various positions in DC Films and the DCEU.]]\nWhile the rival [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) includes television productions, DC's crossover series is a shared continuity for films. Several television series featuring DC characters and storylines have their own shared continuity, frequently referred to as the [[Arrowverse]].<ref name=\"Arrowverse\"/> DC's [[chief creative officer]] [[Geoff Johns]] explained DC's difference in approach to [[Marvel Studios]] and their cinematic universe, saying, \"We look at it as the [[multiverse]]. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach.\"<ref name=\"GoeffJonesBuzzFeed\"/> In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman expanded on DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, \"We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other. You'll see the difference when you see ... the things that we are working on.\"<ref name=\"SilvermanTHR\"/>\n\nIn May 2016, following criticism of ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'', Warner Bros. established a [[DC Films]] division with Geoff Johns and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg as its heads,<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsVulture\"/> which oversees production to form a cohesive creative direction for the franchise.<ref name=\"Shakeup\"/><ref name=\"WarnerBrosResponse\"/> DC Films would not be fully autonomous, as Johns reported to DC president [[Diane Nelson (comics)|Diane Nelson]] and Berg reported to Silverman.<ref name=\"Shakeup\"/> [[Charles Roven]] was also moved from his day-by-day producer role on future DC films, which he had served since 2005's ''Batman Begins'', to an administrative executive producer role.<ref name=\"RovenFallout\"/> In December, Silverman was ousted from his role in Warner Bros., and [[Toby Emmerich]] was promoted to president and chief content officer, in his place.<ref name=\"EmmerichCCO\"/> By January 2017, Johns and Berg reported to Emmerich.<ref name=\"GreenLanternWriters\"/> Following the financial and critical success of ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' in June 2017, Johns stated that moving forward the films will focus on the heart, humor, hope, heroics, and optimism of the characters.<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsTheWrap\"/> As a result of [[Justice League (film)|''Justice League'']]'s underperformance at the box office, Berg left his position by January 2018 and became a production partner with [[Roy Lee]].<ref name=\"Shakeup2\"/><ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> DC also sought to deemphasize the shared nature of their films, with Diane Nelson stating, \"Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall storyline or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them.\"<ref name=\"RethinkVulture\"/>\n\nIn January 2018, [[Walter Hamada]] was appointed the President of DC Films and co-runner of the DCEU, replacing Berg.<ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> The following month, Chantal Nong was named Vice President of DC Films.<ref name=\"ChantalNongVP\"/> The pair were hired to oversee the franchise with Johns, as the key production team managers.<ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> However, Johns stepped down from his executive roles at DC in June 2018. He created a production company, Mad Ghost Productions, to have a greater hands-on role in various DC media as a writer and producer.<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsExit\"/> After the financial success of ''Aquaman'', Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] said the upcoming slate of DC films would be focused on individual character stories instead of interconnectivity.<ref name=\"TsujiharaLATimes\"/>\n\n== Released films ==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n!

The term can legitimately refer to any form of psychotherapy when delivered in a group format, including [[Art therapy]], [[cognitive behavioural therapy]] or [[interpersonal therapy]], but it is usually applied to [[psychodynamic]] group therapy where the group context and [[group process]] is explicitly utilised as a mechanism of change by developing, exploring and examining interpersonal relationships within the group.\n\nThe broader concept of ''group [[therapy]]'' can be taken to include any helping process that takes place in a group, including [[support groups]], skills training groups (such as [[anger management]], [[mindfulness]], [[relaxation training]] or [[social skills]] training), and [[psychoeducation]] groups. The differences between psychodynamic groups, activity groups, support groups, problem-solving and psychoeducational groups have been discussed by psychiatrist Charles Montgomery.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Montgomery |first=Charles |date=January 2002 |title=Role of dynamic group therapy in psychiatry |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=34\u201341 |doi=10.1192/apt.8.1.34 }}</ref> Other, more specialised forms of group therapy would include non-verbal [[expressive therapy|expressive therapies]] such as [[art therapy]], [[dance therapy]], or [[music therapy]].\n\n==History==\nThe founders of group psychotherapy in the USA were Joseph H. Pratt, [[Trigant Burrow]] and [[Paul Schilder]]. All three of them were active and working at the East Coast in the first half of the 20th century. In 1932 [[Jacob L. Moreno]] presented his work on group psychotherapy to the [[American Psychiatric Association]], and co-authored a monograph on the subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-qkaAAAAIAAJ&q=inauthor:%22Jacob+Levy+Moreno%22&dq=inauthor:%22Jacob+Levy+Moreno%22|title=Group method and group psychotherapy|first1=Jacob Levy|last1=Moreno|first2=Helen Hall|last2=Jennings|first3=Ernest Stagg|last3=Whitin| author4 = National Committee on Prisons | name-list-format = vanc |date=9 April 2018|publisher=Beacon House|access-date=9 April 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> After [[World War II]], group psychotherapy was further developed by Moreno, [[Samuel Slavson]], [[Hyman Spotnitz]], [[Irvin Yalom]], and Lou Ormont. Yalom's approach to group therapy has been very influential not only in the USA but across the world.\n\nAn early development in group therapy was the [[T-group (social psychology)|T-group]] or training group (sometimes also referred to as [[Sensitivity training|sensitivity-training]] group, human relations training group or encounter group), a form of group psychotherapy where participants (typically, between eight and 15 people) learn about themselves (and about small group processes in general) through their interaction with each other. They use feedback, problem solving, and role play to gain insights into themselves, others, and groups. It was pioneered in the mid-1940s by [[Kurt Lewin]] and [[Carl Rogers]] and his colleagues as a method of learning about human behavior in what became the [[National Training Laboratories]] (also known as the [[NTL Institute]]) that was created by the [[Office of Naval Research]] and the [[National Education Association]] in Bethel, Maine, in 1947.\n\nMoreno developed a specific and highly structured form of group therapy known as [[psychodrama]] (although the entry on psychodrama claims it is not a form of group therapy). Another recent development in the theory and method of group psychotherapy based on an integration of systems thinking is [[Yvonne Agazarian]]'s [[systems-centered therapy]] (SCT), which sees groups functioning within the principles of system dynamics. Her method of \"functional subgrouping\" introduces a method of organizing group communication so it is less likely to react counterproductively to differences. SCT also emphasizes the need to recognize the phases of group development and the defenses related to each phase in order to best make sense and influence group dynamics.\n\nIn the United Kingdom group psychotherapy initially developed independently, with pioneers [[S. H. Foulkes]] and [[Wilfred Bion]] using group therapy as an approach to treating combat fatigue in the Second World War. Foulkes and Bion were psychoanalysts and incorporated psychoanalysis into group therapy by recognising that [[transference]] can arise not only between group members and the therapist but also among group members. Furthermore, the psychoanalytic concept of the unconscious was extended with a recognition of a group unconscious, in which the unconscious processes of group members could be acted out in the form of irrational processes in group sessions. Foulkes developed the model known as [[group analysis]] and the [[Institute of Group Analysis]], while Bion was influential in the development of group therapy at the [[Tavistock Clinic]].\n\nBion's approach is comparable to [[social therapy]], first developed in the United States in the late 1970s by [[Lois Holzman]] and [[Fred Newman (philosopher)|Fred Newman]], which is a group therapy in which practitioners relate to the group, not its individuals, as the fundamental unit of development. The task of the group is to \"build the group\" rather than focus on problem solving or \"fixing\" individuals.\n\nIn Argentina an independent school of group analysis stemmed from the work and teachings of Swiss-born Argentine psychoanalyst [[Enrique Pichon-Rivi\u00e8re]]. This thinker conceived of a group-centered approach which, although not directly influenced by Foulkes' work, was fully compatible with it.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tubert-Oklander|first1=Juan|last2= de Tubert|first2=Reyna Hern\u00e1ndez | name-list-format = vanc |title=Operative groups : the Latin-American approach to group analysis|date=2004|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London|isbn=978-1-84310-094-2}}</ref>\n\n==Therapeutic principles==\n[[Irvin Yalom]] proposed a number of therapeutic factors (originally termed ''curative factors'' but renamed ''therapeutic'' factors in the 5th edition of ''The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy'').\n* '''Universality'''\n:The recognition of shared experiences and feelings among group members and that these may be widespread or universal human concerns, serves to remove a group member's sense of isolation, validate their experiences, and raise self-esteem\n* '''Altruism'''\n:The group is a place where members can help each other, and the experience of being able to give something to another person can lift the member's self esteem and help develop more adaptive coping styles and interpersonal skills.\n* '''Instillation of hope'''\n:In a mixed group that has members at various stages of development or recovery, a member can be inspired and encouraged by another member who has overcome the problems with which they are still struggling.\n* '''Imparting information'''\n:While this is not strictly speaking a psychotherapeutic process, members often report that it has been very helpful to learn factual information from other members in the group. For example, about their treatment or about access to services.\n* '''Corrective recapitulation of the primary family experience'''\n:Members often [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]] identify the group therapist and other group members with their own parents and siblings in a process that is a form of [[transference]] specific to group psychotherapy. The therapist's interpretations can help group members gain understanding of the impact of childhood experiences on their personality, and they may learn to avoid unconsciously repeating unhelpful past interactive patterns in present-day relationships.\n* '''Development of socializing techniques'''\n:The group setting provides a safe and supportive environment for members to take risks by extending their repertoire of interpersonal behaviour and improving their social skills\n* '''Imitative behaviour'''\n:One way in which group members can develop social skills is through a [[Observational learning|modeling]] process, observing and imitating the therapist and other group members. For example, sharing personal feelings, showing concern, and supporting others.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kislev|first1=Elyakim | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Use of Participant-Observers in Group Therapy: A Critical Exploration in Light of Foucauldian Theory|journal=Group|date=2015|volume=39|issue=1|pages=9\u201324|doi=10.13186/group.39.1.0009 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280076179 }}</ref>\n* '''Cohesiveness'''\n:It has been suggested<ref name=\"Joyce_2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Joyce AS, Piper WE, Ogrodniczuk JS | title = Therapeutic alliance and cohesion variables as predictors of outcome in short-term group psychotherapy | journal = International Journal of Group Psychotherapy | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 269\u201396 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17661544 | doi = 10.1521/ijgp.2007.57.3.269 }}</ref> that this is the primary therapeutic factor from which all others flow. Humans are herd animals with an instinctive need to belong to groups, and personal development can only take place in an interpersonal context. A cohesive group is one in which all members feel a sense of belonging, acceptance, and validation.\n* '''Existential factors'''\n:Learning that one has to take responsibility for one's own life and the consequences of one's decisions.\n* '''Catharsis'''\n:[[Catharsis]] is the experience of relief from emotional distress through the free and uninhibited expression of emotion. When members tell their story to a supportive audience, they can obtain relief from chronic feelings of shame and guilt.\n* '''Interpersonal learning'''\n:Group members achieve a greater level of [[self-awareness]] through the process of interacting with others in the group, who give feedback on the member's behaviour and impact on others.\n* '''Self-understanding'''\n:This factor overlaps with interpersonal learning but refers to the achievement of greater levels of insight into the genesis of one's problems and the unconscious motivations that underlie one's behaviour.\n\n==Settings==\nGroup therapy can form part of the [[Milieu therapy|therapeutic milieu]] of a psychiatric in-patient unit<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Yalom | first1 = Irvin D. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Inpatient Group Psychotherapy | date = 1983 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-465-03298-3 }}</ref> or ambulatory psychiatric [[partial hospitalization]] (also known as [[day hospital]] treatment).<ref name=\"Ogrodniczuk_2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ogrodniczuk JS, Steinberg PI | title = A renewed interest in day treatment | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 77 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15754672 | doi = 10.1177/070674370505000120 }}</ref>\nIn addition to classical \"talking\" therapy, group therapy in an institutional setting can also include group-based [[expressive therapy|expressive therapies]] such as [[drama therapy]], [[psychodrama]], [[art therapy]], and non-verbal types of therapy such as [[music therapy]] and dance/movement therapy.\n\nGroup psychotherapy is a key component of [[milieu therapy]] in a [[therapeutic community]].

The term can legitimately refer to any form of psychotherapy when delivered in a group format, including [[Art therapy]], [[cognitive behavioural therapy]] or [[interpersonal therapy]], but it is usually applied to [[psychodynamic]] group therapy where the group context and [[group process]] is explicitly utilised as a mechanism of change by developing, exploring and examining interpersonal relationships within the group.\n\nThe broader concept of ''group [[therapy]]'' can be taken to include any helping process that takes place in a group, including [[support groups]], skills training groups (such as [[anger management]], [[mindfulness]], [[relaxation training]] or [[social skills]] training), and [[psychoeducation]] groups. The differences between psychodynamic groups, activity groups, support groups, problem-solving and psychoeducational groups have been discussed by psychiatrist Charles Montgomery.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Montgomery |first=Charles |date=January 2002 |title=Role of dynamic group therapy in psychiatry |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=34\u201341 |doi=10.1192/apt.8.1.34 }}</ref> Other, more specialised forms of group therapy would include non-verbal [[expressive therapy|expressive therapies]] such as [[art therapy]], [[dance therapy]], or [[music therapy]].\n\n==History==\nThe founders of group psychotherapy in the USA were Joseph H. Pratt, [[Trigant Burrow]] and [[Paul Schilder]]. All three of them were active and working at the East Coast in the first half of the 20th century. In 1932 [[Jacob L. Moreno]] presented his work on group psychotherapy to the [[American Psychiatric Association]], and co-authored a monograph on the subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-qkaAAAAIAAJ&q=inauthor:%22Jacob+Levy+Moreno%22&dq=inauthor:%22Jacob+Levy+Moreno%22|title=Group method and group psychotherapy|first1=Jacob Levy|last1=Moreno|first2=Helen Hall|last2=Jennings|first3=Ernest Stagg|last3=Whitin| author4 = National Committee on Prisons | name-list-format = vanc |date=9 April 2018|publisher=Beacon House|access-date=9 April 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> After [[World War II]], group psychotherapy was further developed by Moreno, [[Samuel Slavson]], [[Hyman Spotnitz]], [[Irvin Yalom]], and Lou Ormont. Yalom's approach to group therapy has been very influential not only in the USA but across the world.\n\nAn early development in group therapy was the [[T-group (social psychology)|T-group]] or training group (sometimes also referred to as [[Sensitivity training|sensitivity-training]] group, human relations training group or encounter group), a form of group psychotherapy where participants (typically, between eight and 15 people) learn about themselves (and about small group processes in general) through their interaction with each other. They use feedback, problem solving, and role play to gain insights into themselves, others, and groups. It was pioneered in the mid-1940s by [[Kurt Lewin]] and [[Carl Rogers]] and his colleagues as a method of learning about human behavior in what became the [[National Training Laboratories]] (also known as the [[NTL Institute]]) that was created by the [[Office of Naval Research]] and the [[National Education Association]] in Bethel, Maine, in 1947.\n\nMoreno developed a specific and highly structured form of group therapy known as [[psychodrama]] (although the entry on psychodrama claims it is not a form of group therapy). Another recent development in the theory and method of group psychotherapy based on an integration of systems thinking is [[Yvonne Agazarian]]'s [[systems-centered therapy]] (SCT), which sees groups functioning within the principles of system dynamics. Her method of \"functional subgrouping\" introduces a method of organizing group communication so it is less likely to react counterproductively to differences. SCT also emphasizes the need to recognize the phases of group development and the defenses related to each phase in order to best make sense and influence group dynamics.\n\nIn the United Kingdom group psychotherapy initially developed independently, with pioneers [[S. H. Foulkes]] and [[Wilfred Bion]] using group therapy as an approach to treating combat fatigue in the Second World War. Foulkes and Bion were psychoanalysts and incorporated psychoanalysis into group therapy by recognising that [[transference]] can arise not only between group members and the therapist but also among group members. Furthermore, the psychoanalytic concept of the unconscious was extended with a recognition of a group unconscious, in which the unconscious processes of group members could be acted out in the form of irrational processes in group sessions. Foulkes developed the model known as [[group analysis]] and the [[Institute of Group Analysis]], while Bion was influential in the development of group therapy at the [[Tavistock Clinic]].\n\nBion's approach is comparable to [[social therapy]], first developed in the United States in the late 1970s by [[Lois Holzman]] and [[Fred Newman (philosopher)|Fred Newman]], which is a group therapy in which practitioners relate to the group, not its individuals, as the fundamental unit of development. The task of the group is to \"build the group\" rather than focus on problem solving or \"fixing\" individuals.\n\nIn Argentina an independent school of group analysis stemmed from the work and teachings of Swiss-born Argentine psychoanalyst [[Enrique Pichon-Rivi\u00e8re]]. This thinker conceived of a group-centered approach which, although not directly influenced by Foulkes' work, was fully compatible with it.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tubert-Oklander|first1=Juan|last2= de Tubert|first2=Reyna Hern\u00e1ndez | name-list-format = vanc |title=Operative groups : the Latin-American approach to group analysis|date=2004|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London|isbn=978-1-84310-094-2}}</ref>\n\n==Therapeutic principles==\n[[Irvin Yalom]] proposed a number of therapeutic factors (originally termed ''curative factors'' but renamed ''therapeutic'' factors in the 5th edition of ''The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy'').\n* '''Universality'''\n:The recognition of shared experiences and feelings among group members and that these may be widespread or universal human concerns, serves to remove a group member's sense of isolation, validate their experiences, and raise self-esteem\n* '''Altruism'''\n:The group is a place where members can help each other, and the experience of being able to give something to another person can lift the member's self esteem and help develop more adaptive coping styles and interpersonal skills.\n* '''Instillation of hope'''\n:In a mixed group that has members at various stages of development or recovery, a member can be inspired and encouraged by another member who has overcome the problems with which they are still struggling.\n* '''Imparting information'''\n:While this is not strictly speaking a psychotherapeutic process, members often report that it has been very helpful to learn factual information from other members in the group. For example, about their treatment or about access to services.\n* '''Corrective recapitulation of the primary family experience'''\n:Members often [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]] identify the group therapist and other group members with their own parents and siblings in a process that is a form of [[transference]] specific to group psychotherapy. The therapist's interpretations can help group members gain understanding of the impact of childhood experiences on their personality, and they may learn to avoid unconsciously repeating unhelpful past interactive patterns in present-day relationships.\n* '''Development of socializing techniques'''\n:The group setting provides a safe and supportive environment for members to take risks by extending their repertoire of interpersonal behaviour and improving their social skills\n* '''Imitative behaviour'''\n:One way in which group members can develop social skills is through a [[Observational learning|modeling]] process, observing and imitating the therapist and other group members. For example, sharing personal feelings, showing concern, and supporting others.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kislev|first1=Elyakim | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Use of Participant-Observers in Group Therapy: A Critical Exploration in Light of Foucauldian Theory|journal=Group|date=2015|volume=39|issue=1|pages=9\u201324|doi=10.13186/group.39.1.0009 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280076179 }}</ref>\n* '''Cohesiveness'''\n:It has been suggested<ref name=\"Joyce_2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Joyce AS, Piper WE, Ogrodniczuk JS | title = Therapeutic alliance and cohesion variables as predictors of outcome in short-term group psychotherapy | journal = International Journal of Group Psychotherapy | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 269\u201396 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17661544 | doi = 10.1521/ijgp.2007.57.3.269 }}</ref> that this is the primary therapeutic factor from which all others flow.

The new government signed an [[Armistice of Cassibile|armistice]] with the Allies on 8 September 1943. However, German forces soon took control of northern and central Italy; Mussolini, who was rescued by German paratroopers, established a collaborationist puppet state, the Italian Social Republic (RSI) to administer the German-occupied territory. The Germans, often with Italian fascists, also committed several [[Axis war crimes in Italy|atrocities]] against civilians and non-fascist troops. As result, the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Army]] was created to fight against the RSI and its German allies, alongside the large Italian resistance movement, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the [[National Republican Army]]. This period is known as the [[Italian Civil War]]. The campaign ended when [[Army Group C]] surrendered unconditionally to the Allies on May 2, 1945, one week before the formal [[German Instrument of Surrender]]. The independent states of [[Battle of San Marino|San Marino]] and [[The Bombing of The Vatican|the Vatican]], both surrounded by Italian territory, also suffered damage during the campaign.\n\n==Strategic background==\nEven before the victory in the [[North African Campaign|North African campaign]] in May 1943, there was disagreement among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on the best strategy to defeat the [[Axis powers|Axis]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The British, especially the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], advocated their traditional naval-based peripheral strategy. Even with a large [[British Army|army]], but greater [[Royal Navy|naval]] power, the traditional British answer against a continental enemy was to fight as part of a coalition and mount small peripheral operations designed to gradually weaken the enemy. The United States, with the larger [[U.S. Army]], favoured a more direct method of fighting the main force of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] in [[Western Front (World War II)|northwestern Europe]]. The ability to launch such a campaign depended on first winning the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\nThe strategic disagreement was fierce, with the U.S. service chiefs arguing for an invasion of France as early as possible, while their British counterparts advocated a policy centred on operations in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. There was even pressure from some Latin American countries to stage an invasion of Spain, which, under [[Francisco Franco]], was friendly to the Axis nations, although not a participant in the war.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802544,00.html \"Batista's Boost\"], ''TIME'', January 18, 1943, Retrieved March 2, 2010</ref> The American staff believed that a full-scale invasion of France at the earliest possible time was required to end the war in Europe, and that no operations should be undertaken that might delay that effort. The British argued that the presence of large numbers of troops trained for amphibious landings in the Mediterranean made a limited-scale invasion possible and useful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nEventually the U.S. and British political leadership reached a compromise in which both would commit most of their forces to an invasion of France in early 1944, but also launch a relatively small-scale Italian campaign. A contributing factor was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s desire to keep U.S. troops active in the European theatre during 1943 and his attraction to the idea of eliminating Italy from the war.<ref>Carver, pp4 & 59</ref> It was hoped that an invasion might knock Italy out of the conflict,<ref>Blumenson 1969, p. 7.</ref> or at least increase the pressure on it and weaken it.<ref>Weinberg 1994, pp. 588 & 591.</ref><ref name=\"Liddell Hart 1970, p. 457\">Liddell Hart 1970, p. 457.</ref> The elimination of Italy would enable Allied naval forces, principally the [[Royal Navy]], to dominate the Mediterranean Sea, securing the lines of communications with Egypt and thus Asia.<ref name=\"Liddell Hart 1970, p. 457\"/><ref>Keegan 2005, p. 287.</ref> Italian divisions on occupation and coastal defence duties in the Balkans and France would be withdrawn to defend Italy, while the Germans would have to transfer troops from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] to defend Italy and the entire southern coast of France, thus aiding the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Weinberg 1994, p. 591.</ref><ref>Churchill 1959, p. 669.</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\n===Invasion of Sicily===\n{{Main article|Allied invasion of Sicily}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in Sicily 1943 NA4561.jpg|thumb|right|British infantry marching through the town of [[Noto, Sicily]], 11 July 1943]]\n\nA combined Allied invasion of [[Sicily]] began on 10 July 1943 with both amphibious and airborne landings at the [[Gulf of Gela]]. The land forces involved were the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. Seventh Army]], under [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George S. Patton]], and the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], under [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]. The original plan contemplated a strong advance by the British northwards along the east coast to [[Messina]], with the Americans in a supporting role along their left flank. When the Eighth Army were held up by stubborn defences in the rugged hills south of [[Mount Etna]], Patton amplified the American role by a wide advance northwest toward [[Palermo]] and then directly north to cut the northern coastal road. This was followed by an eastward advance north of Etna towards Messina, supported by a series of amphibious landings on the northern coast that propelled Patton's troops into Messina shortly before the first units of the Eighth Army. The defending German and Italian forces were unable to prevent the Allied capture of the island, but they succeeded in evacuating most of their troops to the mainland, with the last leaving on 17 August 1943. The Allied forces gained experience in opposed amphibious operations, coalition warfare, and large airborne drops.\n\n===Invasion of Continental Italy===\n{{Main article|Allied invasion of Italy|Armistice of Cassibile|Operation Achse}}\n[[File:ItalySalernoInvasion1943.jpg|thumb|left|Artillery being landed during the invasion of mainland Italy at Salerno, September 1943]]\nForces of the British Eighth Army, still under Montgomery, landed in the 'toe' of Italy on 3 September 1943 in [[Operation Baytown]], the day the Italian government agreed to an [[Armistice of Cassibile|armistice]] with the Allies. The armistice was publicly announced on 8 September by two broadcasts, first by General Eisenhower and then by a [[Badoglio Proclamation|proclamation by Marshal Badoglio]]. Although the German forces prepared to defend without Italian assistance, only two of their divisions opposite the Eighth Army and one at [[Salerno]] were not tied up disarming the [[Royal Italian Army]].\n\nOn 9 September, forces of the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]], under Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]], expecting little resistance, landed against heavy German resistance at Salerno in [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Operation Avalanche]]; in addition, British forces landed at [[Taranto]] in [[Operation Slapstick]], which was almost unopposed. There had been a hope that, with the surrender of the Italian government, the Germans would withdraw to the north, since at the time [[Adolf Hitler]] had been persuaded that [[Southern Italy]] was strategically unimportant. However, this was not to be; although, for a while, the Eighth Army was able to make relatively easy progress up the eastern coast, capturing the port of [[Bari]] and the important airfields around [[Foggia]]. Despite none of the northern reserves having been made available to the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]], it nevertheless came close to repelling the Salerno landing. The main Allied effort in the west initially centred on the port of [[Naples]]: that city was selected because it was the northernmost port that could receive air cover by [[fighter plane]]s flying from Sicily.\n\nAs the Allies advanced, they encountered increasingly difficult terrain: the [[Apennine Mountains]] form a spine along the Italian peninsula offset somewhat to the east. In the most mountainous areas of [[Abruzzo]], more than half the width of the peninsula comprises crests and peaks over {{convert|3000|ft|m}} that are relatively easy to defend; and the spurs and re-entrants to the spine confronted the Allies with a succession of ridges and rivers across their line of advance. The rivers were subject to sudden and unexpected flooding, which had the potential to thwart the Allied commanders' plans.<ref>Phillips (1957), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Ita-c1-2.html#n20 p. 20]</ref>\n\n===Allied advance to Rome===\n{{Main article|Bernhardt Line|Moro River Campaign|Battle of Monte Cassino|Battle of Anzio}}\n[[File:ItalyDefenseLinesSouthofRome1943 4.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|The situation south of Rome showing German prepared defensive lines]]\nIn early October 1943, Hitler was persuaded by his Army Group Commander in [[Southern Italy]], [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field Marshal]] [[Albert Kesselring]], that the defence of Italy should be conducted as far away from Germany as possible. This would make the most of the natural defensive geography of [[Central Italy]], whilst denying the Allies the easy capture of a succession of airfields, each one being ever closer to Germany. Hitler was also convinced that yielding southern Italy would provide the Allies with a springboard for an invasion of the [[Balkans]], with its vital resources of oil, bauxite and copper.<ref>Orgill, ''The Gothic Line'', p5</ref>\n\n[[File:Canadian sniper in Ortona.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian sniper at the [[Battle of Ortona]]]]\n\nKesselring was given command of the whole of Italy and immediately ordered the preparation of a series of defensive lines across Italy, south of [[Rome]]. Two lines, the [[Volturno Line|Volturno]] and the [[Barbara Line|Barbara]], were used to delay the Allied advance so as to buy time to prepare the most formidable defensive positions, which formed the ''[[Winter Line]]'' \u2013 the collective name for the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]] and two associated defensive lines on the west of the Apennine Mountains, the [[Bernhardt Line|Bernhardt]] and [[Hitler Line|Hitler]] lines (the latter had been renamed the Senger Line by 23 May 1944).<ref>Carver, p. 195</ref>\n\n[[File:Polish II Corps (35) - 1946-05-16 - J\u00f3zef Gawlina in Casarano.jpg|thumb|[[Polish II Corps]] and Bishop [[J\u00f3zef Gawlina]] in [[Casarano]]]]\n[[File:Canadians Italy1.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian soldiers inspect a captured German [[MG34]] machine gun.]]\n\nThe Winter Line proved a major obstacle to the Allies at the end of 1943, halting the Fifth Army's advance on the western side of Italy. Although the Gustav Line was penetrated on the Eighth Army's [[Adriatic]] front, and [[Battle of Ortona|Ortona]] was liberated with heavy casualties to Canadian troops, the blizzards, drifting snow and zero visibility at the end of December caused the advance to grind to a halt. The Allies' focus then turned to the western front, where an attack through the [[Liri]] valley was considered to have the best chance of a breakthrough towards the Italian capital. Landings behind the line [[Battle of Anzio|at Anzio]] during Operation Shingle, advocated by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], were intended to destabilise the German Gustav line defences, but the early thrust inland to cut off the German defences did not occur because of disagreements that the American commander, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[John P. Lucas]], had with the battle plan and his insistence that his forces were not large enough to accomplish their mission. Lucas entrenched his forces, during which time German Field Marshal Kesselring assembled sufficient forces to form a ring around the beachhead. After a month of hard fighting Lucas was replaced by Major General [[Lucian Truscott]] who eventually broke out in May.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-310-0880-38, Italien, Rom, Tiger I vor Vittoriano.jpg|thumb|right|German [[Tiger I]] tank in front of the [[Altare della Patria]] in [[Rome]] in 1944]]\n\nIt took four major offensives between January and May 1944 before the line was eventually broken by a combined assault of the Fifth and Eighth Armies (including British, American, French, Polish, and Canadian corps) concentrated along a twenty-mile front between [[Monte Cassino]] and the western seaboard. In a concurrent action, [[Mark W. Clark|American General Mark Clark]] was ordered to break out of the stagnant position at Anzio and cash in on the opportunity to cut off and destroy a large part of the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]] retreating from the Gustav Line between them and the Canadians. But this opportunity was lost on the brink of success, when Clark disobeyed his orders and sent his U.S. forces to enter the vacant Rome instead.<ref>Katz, ''The Battle for Rome''</ref> Rome had been declared an [[open city]] by the German Army so no resistance was encountered.\n\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA15496.jpg|thumb|left|The ruined town of [[Pontecorvo]], 26 May 1944]]\n\nThe American forces took possession of Rome on 4 June 1944.<ref name=\"Clark, Calculated Risk\">Clark, ''Calculated Risk''</ref> The German Tenth Army were allowed to get away and, in the next few weeks, may have been responsible for doubling the Allied casualties in the next few months.

Churchill, the British Prime Minister, had hoped that a major advance in late 1944 would open the way for the Allied armies to advance northeast through the \"Ljubljana Gap\" (the area between [[Venice]] and [[Vienna]], which is today's [[Slovenia]]) to Vienna and [[Hungary]] to forestall the [[Red Army]] from advancing into [[Eastern Europe]].

The new government signed an [[Armistice of Cassibile|armistice]] with the Allies on 8 September 1943. However, German forces soon took control of northern and central Italy; Mussolini, who was rescued by German paratroopers, established a collaborationist puppet state, the Italian Social Republic (RSI) to administer the German-occupied territory. The Germans, often with Italian fascists, also committed several [[Axis war crimes in Italy|atrocities]] against civilians and non-fascist troops. As result, the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Army]] was created to fight against the RSI and its German allies, alongside the large Italian resistance movement, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the [[National Republican Army]]. This period is known as the [[Italian Civil War]]. The campaign ended when [[Army Group C]] surrendered unconditionally to the Allies on May 2, 1945, one week before the formal [[German Instrument of Surrender]]. The independent states of [[Battle of San Marino|San Marino]] and [[The Bombing of The Vatican|the Vatican]], both surrounded by Italian territory, also suffered damage during the campaign.\n\n==Strategic background==\nEven before the victory in the [[North African Campaign|North African campaign]] in May 1943, there was disagreement among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on the best strategy to defeat the [[Axis powers|Axis]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The British, especially the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], advocated their traditional naval-based peripheral strategy. Even with a large [[British Army|army]], but greater [[Royal Navy|naval]] power, the traditional British answer against a continental enemy was to fight as part of a coalition and mount small peripheral operations designed to gradually weaken the enemy. The United States, with the larger [[U.S. Army]], favoured a more direct method of fighting the main force of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] in [[Western Front (World War II)|northwestern Europe]]. The ability to launch such a campaign depended on first winning the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\nThe strategic disagreement was fierce, with the U.S. service chiefs arguing for an invasion of France as early as possible, while their British counterparts advocated a policy centred on operations in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. There was even pressure from some Latin American countries to stage an invasion of Spain, which, under [[Francisco Franco]], was friendly to the Axis nations, although not a participant in the war.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802544,00.html \"Batista's Boost\"], ''TIME'', January 18, 1943, Retrieved March 2, 2010</ref> The American staff believed that a full-scale invasion of France at the earliest possible time was required to end the war in Europe, and that no operations should be undertaken that might delay that effort. The British argued that the presence of large numbers of troops trained for amphibious landings in the Mediterranean made a limited-scale invasion possible and useful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nEventually the U.S. and British political leadership reached a compromise in which both would commit most of their forces to an invasion of France in early 1944, but also launch a relatively small-scale Italian campaign. A contributing factor was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s desire to keep U.S. troops active in the European theatre during 1943 and his attraction to the idea of eliminating Italy from the war.<ref>Carver, pp4 & 59</ref> It was hoped that an invasion might knock Italy out of the conflict,<ref>Blumenson 1969, p. 7.</ref> or at least increase the pressure on it and weaken it.<ref>Weinberg 1994, pp. 588 & 591.</ref><ref name=\"Liddell Hart 1970, p. 457\">Liddell Hart 1970, p. 457.</ref> The elimination of Italy would enable Allied naval forces, principally the [[Royal Navy]], to dominate the Mediterranean Sea, securing the lines of communications with Egypt and thus Asia.<ref name=\"Liddell Hart 1970, p. 457\"/><ref>Keegan 2005, p. 287.</ref> Italian divisions on occupation and coastal defence duties in the Balkans and France would be withdrawn to defend Italy, while the Germans would have to transfer troops from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] to defend Italy and the entire southern coast of France, thus aiding the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Weinberg 1994, p. 591.</ref><ref>Churchill 1959, p. 669.</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\n===Invasion of Sicily===\n{{Main article|Allied invasion of Sicily}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in Sicily 1943 NA4561.jpg|thumb|right|British infantry marching through the town of [[Noto, Sicily]], 11 July 1943]]\n\nA combined Allied invasion of [[Sicily]] began on 10 July 1943 with both amphibious and airborne landings at the [[Gulf of Gela]]. The land forces involved were the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. Seventh Army]], under [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George S. Patton]], and the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], under [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]. The original plan contemplated a strong advance by the British northwards along the east coast to [[Messina]], with the Americans in a supporting role along their left flank. When the Eighth Army were held up by stubborn defences in the rugged hills south of [[Mount Etna]], Patton amplified the American role by a wide advance northwest toward [[Palermo]] and then directly north to cut the northern coastal road. This was followed by an eastward advance north of Etna towards Messina, supported by a series of amphibious landings on the northern coast that propelled Patton's troops into Messina shortly before the first units of the Eighth Army. The defending German and Italian forces were unable to prevent the Allied capture of the island, but they succeeded in evacuating most of their troops to the mainland, with the last leaving on 17 August 1943. The Allied forces gained experience in opposed amphibious operations, coalition warfare, and large airborne drops.\n\n===Invasion of Continental Italy===\n{{Main article|Allied invasion of Italy|Armistice of Cassibile|Operation Achse}}\n[[File:ItalySalernoInvasion1943.jpg|thumb|left|Artillery being landed during the invasion of mainland Italy at Salerno, September 1943]]\nForces of the British Eighth Army, still under Montgomery, landed in the 'toe' of Italy on 3 September 1943 in [[Operation Baytown]], the day the Italian government agreed to an [[Armistice of Cassibile|armistice]] with the Allies. The armistice was publicly announced on 8 September by two broadcasts, first by General Eisenhower and then by a [[Badoglio Proclamation|proclamation by Marshal Badoglio]]. Although the German forces prepared to defend without Italian assistance, only two of their divisions opposite the Eighth Army and one at [[Salerno]] were not tied up disarming the [[Royal Italian Army]].\n\nOn 9 September, forces of the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]], under Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]], expecting little resistance, landed against heavy German resistance at Salerno in [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Operation Avalanche]]; in addition, British forces landed at [[Taranto]] in [[Operation Slapstick]], which was almost unopposed. There had been a hope that, with the surrender of the Italian government, the Germans would withdraw to the north, since at the time [[Adolf Hitler]] had been persuaded that [[Southern Italy]] was strategically unimportant. However, this was not to be; although, for a while, the Eighth Army was able to make relatively easy progress up the eastern coast, capturing the port of [[Bari]] and the important airfields around [[Foggia]]. Despite none of the northern reserves having been made available to the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]], it nevertheless came close to repelling the Salerno landing. The main Allied effort in the west initially centred on the port of [[Naples]]: that city was selected because it was the northernmost port that could receive air cover by [[fighter plane]]s flying from Sicily.\n\nAs the Allies advanced, they encountered increasingly difficult terrain: the [[Apennine Mountains]] form a spine along the Italian peninsula offset somewhat to the east. In the most mountainous areas of [[Abruzzo]], more than half the width of the peninsula comprises crests and peaks over {{convert|3000|ft|m}} that are relatively easy to defend; and the spurs and re-entrants to the spine confronted the Allies with a succession of ridges and rivers across their line of advance. The rivers were subject to sudden and unexpected flooding, which had the potential to thwart the Allied commanders' plans.<ref>Phillips (1957), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Ita-c1-2.html#n20 p. 20]</ref>\n\n===Allied advance to Rome===\n{{Main article|Bernhardt Line|Moro River Campaign|Battle of Monte Cassino|Battle of Anzio}}\n[[File:ItalyDefenseLinesSouthofRome1943 4.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|The situation south of Rome showing German prepared defensive lines]]\nIn early October 1943, Hitler was persuaded by his Army Group Commander in [[Southern Italy]], [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field Marshal]] [[Albert Kesselring]], that the defence of Italy should be conducted as far away from Germany as possible. This would make the most of the natural defensive geography of [[Central Italy]], whilst denying the Allies the easy capture of a succession of airfields; each one being ever closer to Germany. Hitler was also convinced that yielding southern Italy would provide the Allies with a springboard for an invasion of the [[Balkans]] with its vital resources of oil, bauxite and copper.<ref>Orgill, ''The Gothic Line'', p5</ref>\n\n[[File:Canadian sniper in Ortona.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian sniper at the [[Battle of Ortona]]]]\n\nKesselring was given command of the whole of Italy and immediately ordered the preparation of a series of defensive lines across Italy, south of [[Rome]]. Two lines, the [[Volturno Line|Volturno]] and the [[Barbara Line|Barbara]], were used to delay the Allied advance so as to buy time to prepare the most formidable defensive positions, which formed the ''[[Winter Line]]'' \u2013 the collective name for the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]] and two associated defensive lines on the west of the Apennine Mountains, the [[Bernhardt Line|Bernhardt]] and [[Hitler Line|Hitler]] lines (the latter had been renamed the Senger Line by 23 May 1944).<ref>Carver, p. 195</ref>\n\n[[File:Polish II Corps (35) - 1946-05-16 - J\u00f3zef Gawlina in Casarano.jpg|thumb|Polish II Corps and bishop [[J\u00f3zef Gawlina]] in [[Casarano]]]]\n[[File:Canadians Italy1.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian soldiers inspect a captured German [[MG34]] machine gun.]]\n\nThe Winter Line proved a major obstacle to the Allies at the end of 1943, halting the Fifth Army's advance on the western side of Italy. Although the Gustav Line was penetrated on the Eighth Army's Adriatic front, and [[Battle of Ortona|Ortona]] was liberated with heavy casualties to Canadian troops, the blizzards, drifting snow and zero visibility at the end of December caused the advance to grind to a halt. The Allies' focus then turned to the western front, where an attack through the [[Liri]] valley was considered to have the best chance of a breakthrough towards the Italian capital. [[Battle of Anzio|Landings at Anzio]] during Operation Shingle, advocated by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], behind the line were intended to destabilise the German Gustav line defences, but the early thrust inland to cut off the German defences did not occur because of disagreements that the American commander, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[John P. Lucas]], had with the battle plan and his insistence that his forces were not large enough to accomplish their mission. Lucas entrenched his forces, during which time German Field Marshal Kesselring assembled sufficient forces to form a ring around the beachhead. After a month of hard fighting Lucas was replaced by Major General [[Lucian Truscott]] who eventually broke out in May.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-310-0880-38, Italien, Rom, Tiger I vor Vittoriano.jpg|thumb|right|German [[Tiger I]] tank in front of the [[Altare della Patria]] in [[Rome]] in 1944]]\n\nIt took four major offensives between January and May 1944 before the line was eventually broken by a combined assault of the Fifth and Eighth Armies (including British, American, French, Polish, and Canadian corps) concentrated along a twenty-mile front between [[Monte Cassino]] and the western seaboard. In a concurrent action, [[Mark W. Clark|American General Mark Clark]] was ordered to break out of the stagnant position at Anzio and cash in on the opportunity to cut off and destroy a large part of the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]] retreating from the Gustav Line between them and the Canadians. But this opportunity was lost on the brink of success, when Clark disobeyed his orders and sent his U.S. forces to enter the vacant Rome instead.<ref>Katz, ''The Battle for Rome''</ref> Rome had been declared an [[open city]] by the German Army so no resistance was encountered.\n\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA15496.jpg|thumb|left|The ruined town of Pontecorvo, 26 May 1944]]\n\nThe American forces took possession of Rome on 4 June 1944.<ref name=\"Clark, Calculated Risk\">Clark, ''Calculated Risk''</ref> The German Tenth Army were allowed to get away and, in the next few weeks, may have been responsible for doubling the Allied casualties in the next few months.

Churchill, the British Prime Minister, had hoped that a major advance in late 1944 would open the way for the Allied armies to advance northeast through the \"Ljubljana Gap\" (the area between [[Venice]] and [[Vienna]], which is today's [[Slovenia]]) to Vienna and [[Hungary]] to forestall the [[Red Army]] from advancing into [[Eastern Europe]].
