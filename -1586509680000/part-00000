One of the two [[pollinium|pollinia]] bends itself towards the [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]].]]\n'''Self-pollination''' is when [[pollen]] from the same plant arrives at the [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] of a flower (in [[flowering plant]]s) or at the [[ovule]] (in [[gymnosperm]]s). There are two types of self-pollination: in [[autogamy]], pollen is transferred to the [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]] of the same flower; in [[geitonogamy]], pollen is transferred from the [[anther]] of one flower to the stigma of another flower on the same flowering plant, or from [[Microsporangia|microsporangium]] to [[ovule]] within a single ([[monoecious]]) gymnosperm. Some plants have mechanisms that ensure autogamy, such as flowers that do not open ([[cleistogamy]]), or [[stamen]]s that move to come into contact with the stigma. The term '''[[selfing]]''' that is often used as a synonym, is not limited to self-pollination, but also applies to other types of self-fertilization.\n\n== Occurrence ==\nFew plants self-pollinate without the aid of pollen vectors (such as wind or insects). The mechanism is seen most often in some [[legume]]s such as [[peanut]]s. In another legume, [[soybean]]s, the flowers open and remain receptive to insect cross pollination during the day. If this is not accomplished, the flowers self-pollinate as they are closing. Among other plants that can self-pollinate are many kinds of [[orchid]]s, [[pea]]s, [[sunflower]]s and [[tridax]].  Most of the self-pollinating plants have small, relatively inconspicuous flowers that shed pollen directly onto the stigma, sometimes even before the bud opens. Self-pollinated plants expend less energy in the production of pollinator attractants and can grow in areas where the kinds of insects or other animals that might visit them are absent or very scarce\u2014as in the Arctic or at high elevations.\n\nSelf-pollination limits the variety of progeny and may [[Inbreeding depression|depress plant vigor]].  However, self-pollination can be advantageous, allowing plants to spread beyond the range of suitable pollinators or produce offspring in areas where pollinator populations have been [[pollinator decline|greatly reduced]] or are naturally variable.<ref name=\"pmid25980327\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Grossenbacher D, Briscoe Runquist R, Goldberg EE, Brandvain Y |title=Geographic range size is predicted by plant mating system |journal=Ecol.

Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen, by wind or animals such as insects and birds, from the anther to the stigma of flowers on separate plants.\n\n== Types of flowers that self pollinate ==\nBoth [[hermaphrodite]] and [[monoecious]] species have the potential for self-pollination leading to self-fertilization unless there is a mechanism to avoid it.  Eighty percent of all flowering plants are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both sexes in the same flower, while 5 percent of plant species are monoecious. The remaining 15% would therefore be dioecious (each plant unisexual). Plants that self-pollinate include several types of orchids, and sunflowers. Dandelions are also capable of self-pollination as well as cross-pollination.\n\n== Advantages of self-pollination ==\nThere are several advantages for self-pollinating flowers. Firstly, if a given genotype is well-suited for an environment, self-pollination helps to keep this trait stable in the species. Not being dependent on pollinating agents allows self-pollination to occur when bees and wind are nowhere to be found. Self-pollination or cross pollination can be an advantage when the number of flowers is small or they are widely spaced. During self-pollination, the pollen grains are not transmitted from one flower to another. As a result, there is less wastage of pollen. Also, self-pollinating plants do not depend on external carriers. They also cannot make changes in their characters and so the features of a species can be maintained with purity.\nSelf-pollination also helps to preserve parental characters as the gametes from the same flower are evolved. It is not necessary for flowers to produce nectar, scent, or to be colourful in order to attract pollinaters.\n\n== Disadvantages of self-pollination ==\nThe disadvantages of self-pollination come from a lack of variation that allows no adaptation to the changing environment or potential pathogen attack. Self-pollination can lead to inbreeding depression caused by expression of deleterious recessive mutations,<ref name=\"pmid19834483\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Charlesworth D, Willis JH |title=The genetics of inbreeding depression |journal=Nat.

After independence, Pakistan had an organisation whereby all divisions were controlled directly by General Headquarters.  Although a corps (the [[I Corps (Pakistan)|I Corps]]) would be raised in the late 1950s, it was found that the organisation was unwieldy, and thus orders for a second corps and a [[field army]] to control the two corps were given, the army was later disbanded.<ref>The Pakistan Army-War 1965-Shaukat Riza-Army Education Press-1984</ref>\n\n==1965 War==\nThe Corps and its assigned assets were still under the process of raising when war came. Its only operational arm was 4 Corps Artillery which was to play a major role in the Kashmir operations preceding the war and in the capture of Chamb and Jaurian under the able command of Brig. Amjad Chaudhry.\n\nLater the formation was moved in support of 6 Armoured Division in the historic Battle of Chawinda. Brig.

After independence, Pakistan had an organisation whereby all divisions were controlled directly by General Headquarters.  Although a corps (the [[I Corps (Pakistan)|I Corps]]) would be raised in the late 1950s, it was found that the organisation was unwieldy, and thus orders for a second corps and a [[field army]] to control the two corps were given, the army was later disbanded.<ref>The Pakistan Army-War 1965-Shaukat Riza-Army Education Press-1984</ref>\n\n==1965 War==\nThe Corps and its assigned assets were still under the process of raising when war came. It's only operational arm was 4 Corps Artillery which was to play a major role in the Kashmir operations preceding the war and in the capture of Chamb and Jaurian under the able command of Brig. Amjad Chaudhry.\n\nLater the formation was moved in support of 6 Armoured Division in the historic Battle of Chawinda. Brig.

Air guitar is generally used in the imaginary simulation of loud electric or [[acoustic guitar]] music.\n\n== History ==\nMusical [[pantomime]], the mimicking of the playing of an instrument, has roots as far back as the 1860s, when it was considered a [[Mental disorder|mental illness]]. The popularity of the [[phonograph]] in the 1930s led to the phenomenon of \"shadow conducting\", in which listeners would pretend to [[Conducting|conduct an orchestra]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2016/06/23/air-guitar-from-elaborate-lark-utopian-gesture/eopfkYUwQM4EowQkCYLJPI/story.html|title=Air guitar, from elaborate lark to utopian gesture|last=Guerrieri|first=Matthew|date=2016-06-23|website=The Boston Globe|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref>\n\nAir guitar itself had a seminal moment at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock music festival]] in 1969 when singer [[Joe Cocker]] mimicked the playing of the keyboard and guitar during his performance of \"[[With a Little Help from My Friends|With a Little Help From My Friends]]\". Cocker's signature elaborate moves helped display air guitar to the broader public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/electrifying-history-air-guitar-180972553/|title=An Electrifying History of Air Guitar|last=White|first=April|date=July 2019|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"air guitar\" gained popularity in the 1980s, with one of the first contests held at [[Florida State University]] in 1978. Contests multiplied in Sweden and the United States during the 1980s, and since 1996, the annual Air Guitar World Championships have been a part of the [[Oulu Music Video Festival]] in [[Oulu]], [[Finland]], and the festival currently administers the Air Guitar World Championships Network of official national championship competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airguitarworldchampionships.com|title=Air Guitar World Championships}}</ref> The idea of the contest was originally coined as a joke, meant only to be a side attraction for the music video festival, but has since become a major draw in its own right.<ref name=\"airguitarworldchampionships1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airguitarworldchampionships.com/2009/EN/history.html|title=Air Guitar World Championships 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822150518/http://www.airguitarworldchampionships.com/2009/EN/history.html|archivedate=August 22, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009 the Network consisted of twenty countries: [[Finland]], [[United States]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]], [[Greece]], [[Belgium]], [[Norway]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], and [[Brazil]].\n\n==Contests==\n[[File:20120824- MG 8352.jpg|thumb|Air Guitar Championship 2012 in Oulu]]\n[[File:Airguitar WC2010 1.JPG|thumb|Kevin \"Narvalwaker\" Leloux at the 2010 Air Guitar World Championships in Oulu, Finland]]\n{{Wikinews|Japanese man retains title at Air Guitar World Championship in Finland}}\nAir guitar contests have much in common with the old [[figure skating]] scoring system, especially using [[Figure skating#6.0 System|6.0 score system]]. The most common set of rules are as following:\n\n* Each participant has to play air guitar on stage in two rounds, each lasting for 1 minute.\n** Round 1: participant plays a selection of their own choosing.  Typically the song has been edited (or a medley has been created) to fit the 60-second format.\n** Round 2: participant plays a section of the song chosen by an organizer or competitor; usually the song is not announced beforehand and kept secret until the round begins, so a participant has to [[Improvisation|improvise]].\n* Participant plays alone; backing bands, either with real or air instruments are not allowed; [[Road crew|roadie]]s and [[groupie]]s are allowed to make up some image, but they have to leave the stage before performance.\n* Participant has to play air guitar (i.e. air drums, piano and other instruments are not allowed). Air guitar can be acoustic, electric or both.\n* Generally, there is no dress code and participant is encouraged to use any clothing and props that would add character and make the performance more interesting. However, any real musical equipment or crew (instruments, [[guitar amplifier|amplifiers]], [[Effects unit|effect pedal]]s, backing band members, etc.) are strictly forbidden. Some events make an exception for a real guitar pick, some don't.\n* Jury consists of independent judges, usually B-list musicians, music critics, comedians, or other members of the media.\n* Judges use the same 6.0 score system as in the traditional figure skating system: there are several varying criteria, and each judge must give the contestant a score from 4.0 to 6.0 on each of the following:\n** '''Technical merit'''\u2014how much the performance looks like the real playing, including accurate reproduction of all fretwork, chords, solos and technical moves.\n** '''Mimesmanship'''\u2014how convincingly the performer can [[mime]] their performance, and create the illusion of an invisible guitar, apart from the technical accuracy of the fretwork \n** '''Stage presence'''\u2014a [[charisma]] of rock star, the ability to rock, lack of stage fright and power to drive thousands of listeners; involves [[guitar showmanship]] and other emotional demonstrations.\n** '''Airness'''\u2014the most subjective criterion, as \"presentation\" in figure skating\u2014how much the performance was an object of [[art]] by itself, not only a simulation of playing guitar.\n\n===World===\n\n[[Image:Agworldchamps.png|right]]\nAnnual world championships, officially named \"The Annual Air Guitar World Championship Contest\", were first held in 1996 as part of the Oulu Music Video Festival in [[Oulu]], [[Finland]] and now held there annually in August. The ideology behind the event was that \"wars would end and all the bad things would go away if everyone just played air guitar.\"\n\nParticipants from all over the world competed in skills of playing air guitar. The judging panel included Finnish guitarist Juha Torvinen, and prizes included a custom made 'Flying Finn' guitar and [[Vox (musical equipment)|VOX BM Special amplifier]] donated by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]]. \n\n====List of World Championships====\n\n{| {{MedalistTable|type=Year|width=300}}\n|-\n|2019\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Rob \u201cThe Marquis\u201d Messel, Portland,

Provost, and ran initially for ten years until 2010. The first Australian champion was \u2018Super Dave'. There have been a number of unofficial competitions held in Australia.\n\nAustralians have claimed 2nd place three times and 3rd place three times at the Air Guitar World Championships.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2017, Australia has been represented at the Air Guitar World Championships a number of times through the Dark Horse Qualifiers, though has not had an official national champion.\n\nIn 2014 ABC Kids aired an episode of Whacky World Beaters, filmed on location at the Air Guitar World Championships in 2013.\n\nAir Guitar Australia was reformed in 2017 by Tom \"Sgt. Wrecker\" Hill, who has represented Australia four times at the Air Guitar World Championships. Air Guitar Australia launched at the Embassy of Finland at the Suomi 100 celebrations in September 2017. The competition was won by Jimmy Dangles who was presented with the Ronnie Riffless Memorial Trophy by Ambassador Lars Backstr\u00f6m. The 2018 Championship season saw competitors from NT, NSW, QLD, ACT, Victoria and WA qualifying at State and Territory Qualifiers in Canberra, Perth and Melbourne. The Finals will be held in Melbourne and the winner will represent Australia at the Air Guitar World Championships in August 2018.\n\n===United States===\nIn 2003, Cedric Devitt and Kriston Rucker founded US Air Guitar, the official governing body of air guitar in the US.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2005815,00.html | work=Time | title=The Air Guitar | first=Charlie | last=Duerr | date=22 July 2010}}</ref> The 2003 US Air Guitar Championships included just two regional competitions, in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Los Angeles]], with the national championship taking place in Los Angeles. David \"C-Diddy\" Jung won the competition, becoming the first ever US Air Guitar Champion and earning a spot in the World Air Guitar Championships. He was accompanied by fellow American Dan \"Bjorn Turoque\" Crane, who raised money to pay for his trip to Finland, where he qualified for the World Championships through a Dark Horse competition. At the World Championships, C-Diddy emerged victorious, becoming the first American to win the title of World Air Guitar Champion. Jung and Crane were featured in the 2006 documentary [[Air Guitar Nation]], a film that documented their 2003 journey, from the United States to Finland.\n\nThe 2004 US Air Guitar Championships featured regional competitions in five cities. MiRi \"Sonyk-Rok\" Park, winner of the New York City regional, took the national crown by defeating Fatima \"The Rockness Monster\" Hoang from Los Angeles.  She went on to [[Finland]], where she tied for first place, becoming the 2004 World Air Guitar Co-Champion.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/fashion/sundaystyles/play-that-funky-oh-never-mind.html?pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | title=Play That Funky ...

In 2012, he was overtaken in the US by Matt \u201cAiristotle\u201d Burns, but ultimately won the 2012 World Air Guitar Championships after qualifying as a dark horse competitor.\n\nIn 2013, Jason \"Lt. Facemelter\" Farnan captured the U.S. Air Guitar Championship after posting a perfect score in the compulsory round, which was the first in U.S. Air Guitar history to feature a live guitarist.\n\nWhile the United States missed gold at the 2014 World Air Guitar Championships, \"Airistotle\" and \"Mean Melin\" took second and third place, respectively, for the US. This marked the third consecutive year in which one country produced two of the top three finishers\u2014the first time this feat has been accomplished since 2000, when Finland took the top two spots.\n\nIn 2017, US Air Guitar crowned its first female champion since 2004, Nicole \"Mom Jeans Jeanie\" Sevcik. In 2018, Brittany \u201cGeorgia Lunch\u201d Diaz took the National Finals, giving US Air Guitar back to back female champions for the first time.\n\n====List of United States Championships====\n\n{| {{MedalistTable|type=Year|width=100}}\n|-\n|2019\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Rob \u201cThe Marquis\u201d Messel, Portland, OR|USA}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Kate \"KitKat\" Rose, Sacramento, CA|USA}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Matt \u201cAiristotle\u201d Burns, New York City|USA}}\n|-\n|2018\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Brittany \u201cGeorgia Lunch\u201d Diaz, New York City|USA}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Rob \"Windhammer\" Weychert, New York City|USA}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Colin \"Old Glory\" Bach, Chicago|USA}}\n|-\n|2017\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Nicole \"Mom Jeans Jeanie\" Sevcik, Atlanta|USA}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Beth \"CindAIRella\" Melin, Kansas City, KS|USA}} / {{flagIOCathlete|Alexander \u201cThe Jinja Assassin\u201d Roberts, Chicago|USA}}\n| \n|-\n|2016\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Matt \u201cAiristotle\u201d Burns, New York City|USA}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Nicole \"Mom Jeans Jeanie\" Sevcik, Atlanta|USA}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Rob \"The Marquis\" Messel, Portland|USA}}\n|-\n|2015\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Matt \u201cAiristotle\u201d Burns, New York City|USA}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Lance \"The Shred\" Kasten, Washington, DC|USA}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Andrew \"Flying Finn\" Finn, Des Moines / Jeff \"The Airtiste\" Stiles, Boston / Whit \"Witness\" Hubner, Nashville|USA}}\n|-\n|2014\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Matt \u201cAiristotle\u201d Burns, New York City|USA}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Doug \"The Thunder\" Stroock, Washington, DC|USA}}\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Jason \u201cLt.

are currently two national air guitar championships running in the UK, both claiming status as the 'official' competition.\n\nThe UK Air Guitar Championships (UKAG) is the longest running air guitar championships in the world, established between 1994 and 1995 by Jeffrey Louis-Reed, and is still to this day the only Air Guitar Championships where the audience are the judges. It is also the only UK competition that tours the whole UK to find a true champion.\n\nThe similarly named, Air Guitar UK Championships (AGUK) was created in 2006 by two-time world Air Guitar champion Zac Monro. It originated over the issues of how to decide the competition (through the audience, or by a figure-skating style [[6.0 system|judging system]]), and over membership of the World Air Guitar Network (UKAG were unwilling to pay to participate in the World Championships, as their competition wished to remain free, which was the main cause of the creation of AGUK). However this is the only championship officially recognised as part of Air Guitar World Championships (AGWC)\n\nThe Air Guitar UK Championship was created in 2006 by twice air guitar world champion Zac 'the Magnet' Monroe (the first non-Finn to win the competition<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,544692,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=My week: Zac Monro}}</ref>) and is affiliated with the Air Guitar World Championships in [[Oulu]], [[Finland]], forming part of the [[Air guitar#Official Air Guitar World Championships Network Countries|World Air Guitar Network]].\n\nIn September 2011, Air Guitar UK launched Air Guitar Wales and Air Guitar Northern Ireland to join Air Guitar Scotland (first launched by AGUK in 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/air-way-to-heaven-for-guitarists-1.981574 |title=Air-way to heaven for &apos;guitarists&apos; (From Evening Times) |publisher=Eveningtimes.co.uk |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2017-08-21}}</ref>) as part of the Air Guitar UK Network.\n\nThe first official Championship was held in August 2006 at the Academy Islington, London, and was won by Gabi \u201cThe Hoxton Creeper\u201d Matzeu, who was sent to Finland as the UK's 1st Official Champion.\n\nIn 2007, in the run-up to release of the cult Film [[Air Guitar Nation]], the second Championship played once again to a full house at the Academy. It was held at the Academy until 2010, and in 2011 moved to The Garage, Islington.\n\nAir Guitar UK events are held in support of the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]]. Air Guitar is considered a force for good, and in the absence of world peace this is at least something.\n\nAll profits from all of the Air Guitar UK events are donated to the Teenage Cancer Trust (www.teenagecancertrust.org).\n\nAGUK's official site can be found at https://web.archive.org/web/20070216235714/http://www.airguitaruk.com/\n\n====UKAG====\n\nThe UK Air Guitar Championships were founded in the upstairs of a pub called 'The Pig in Paradise' which is in central Brighton, England. The UK Air Guitar championships annually hosts regional championships in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the north and south of England to find the best competitors from the UK and bring them to the national final stage to battle for crown of UK Air Guitar Champion\n\nFarmer John AKA Doozer McDooze won the 2004 UK air guitar championship.\n\nChristopher 'Crispy' Vearncombe won the competition in 2005, but was killed in a road traffic accident in South Africa weeks before the 2006 competition. His many friends hold an annual charity music festival in his memory. [[Crispystock]] is held in his home town of Andover, Hampshire. Next came Colin 'Cozza' Fulker who won 2006, 2007 and 2008 to become one of the UKAG's most successful champions.\n\n2009 saw Declan Gillick aka 'Deku Chan' win the competition. It was also the first year that drinks manufacturer WKD sponsored the competition.\n\n2010 - UKAG returned to London for the national final; the winner of the southern England heat, 'Eddie Six Strings' aka Sophie Aymonier, wriggled her way into the final and beat 'Juan Nightstand' to become the first ever female UK Air Guitar Champion.\n\nMany air bands were founded in Brighton in the late 90s with acts such as 'Dum BN3', 'PISS', Satans underpants and 'Triple Slash'. There were many more who all took part in the UK Air Guitar Championships and a few of them won.\n\nUKAG work's regularly with various charities including RAFA, The 1800 Club and Action Medical Research\n\nWebsite: http://www.ukairguitar.com\n\n==Innovations==\n\nThere are multiple technological innovations that try to allow air guitar to be played as a real instrument, producing sounds that depend on air guitarist's actions.\n\nIn 2005, students from the [[Aalto University School of Science and Technology|Helsinki University of Technology]] developed a system that translates hand movements into electric guitar sounds, resulting in a functional air guitar.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8383 | title = Air guitarists' rock dreams come true | first = Will | last = Knight | publisher = [[New Scientist]] | date = 28 November 2005 | access-date = 31 May 2008}}</ref> The system, consisting of a pair of brightly coloured gloves and an infrared camera, is one of the most popular exhibits at the Helsinki Science Center. The camera recognizes the distance between the two gloves as well as strumming movements made by the wearer to synthesize an electric guitar tune, working using only six notes.\n\nIn November 2006, researchers at the [[Australia]]n government's [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] announced they had developed a T-shirt that senses human movement to \"showcase its expertise in designing and manufacturing electronic and intelligent textiles with which people effortlessly control computers\", publicising it as an air guitar shirt.<ref>{{cite news\n|url = http://www.csiro.au/science/AirGuitar.html\n|title = It's not rocket science... it's rockin' science\n|first = Richard\n|last = Helmer\n|publisher = [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]]\n|date = 13 November 2006\n|accessdate = 31 May 2008\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517141701/http://www.csiro.au/science/AirGuitar.html| archivedate= 17 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|url = http://www.csiro.au/news/ps2gl.html\n|title = Every wanna-be rocker's fantasy comes true\n|date = 13 November 2006\n|accessdate = 31 May 2008\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517074456/http://www.csiro.au/news/ps2gl.html| archivedate= 17 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, toy company [[Silverlit]] introduced V-Beat Air Guitar, an air guitar gadget. The three-part device consists of a motion-sensing guitar pick, a neck part with four buttons and a guitar body. By changing the distance between body and neck and pressing a combination of the four buttons on the neck part, up to 48 tones and chords can be played. The V-Beat Air Guitar was won 'Best Music Gadget' on the television program The Gadget Show.<ref>{{cite web\n |title= Play some real guitar.

He was seen playing the Tomy Guitar Rockstar in one of Top Gear's famous challenges.\n\nIn March 2008, [[Jada Toys]] of California introduced the Air Guitar Rocker toy which featured patented technology in a belt buckle. When the user strums a magnetic pick in front of the belt buckle, guitar music plays through a portable amp attached to the users pant or belt. The Air Guitar Rocker is marketed with the popular [[Guitar Hero]] license and was created by toy inventor David F\u00fchrer and his team.<ref>{{cite web|title=5 Best Guitar For Beginners In India|url=https://www.getbeststrings.com/best-guitar-for-beginners-in-india/|date=November 2019}}{date= November 2019}</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, San Francisco, CA startup [[Yobble]] announced the Air Guitar Move, an [[appcessory]] for iPhone and iPod Touch.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Users holds the iPhone in one hand and a motion sensing guitar pick in the other. Based on the motions of both hands, the Air Guitar Move software is able to recognize air guitar movements. The bundled game is a mix of [[Guitar Hero]] and [[Dance Central]]. Red Bull donated $20,000 to the project and is organizing events around Air Guitar Move.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Air Guitar Nation]]'', a documentary film about the

metal]]-style [[electric guitar]], including [[riff]]s, solos, etc. Playing an air guitar usually consists of exaggerated [[strum]]ming and [[guitar pick|picking]] motions and is often coupled with loud [[singing]] or [[Lip sync|lip-synching]]. Air guitar is generally used in the imaginary simulation of loud electric or [[acoustic guitar]] music.\n\n== History ==\nMusical [[pantomime]], the mimicking of the playing of an instrument, has roots as far back as the 1860s, when it was considered a [[Mental disorder|mental illness]]. The popularity of the [[phonograph]] in the 1930s led to the phenomenon of \"shadow conducting\", in which listeners would pretend to [[Conducting|conduct an orchestra]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2016/06/23/air-guitar-from-elaborate-lark-utopian-gesture/eopfkYUwQM4EowQkCYLJPI/story.html|title=Air guitar, from elaborate lark to utopian gesture|last=Guerrieri|first=Matthew|date=2016-06-23|website=The Boston Globe|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref>\n\nAir guitar itself had a seminal moment at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock music festival]] in 1969 when singer [[Joe Cocker]] mimicked the playing of the keyboard and guitar during his performance of \"[[With a Little Help from My Friends|With a Little Help From My Friends]]\". Cocker's signature elaborate moves helped display air guitar to the broader public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/electrifying-history-air-guitar-180972553/|title=An Electrifying History of Air Guitar|last=White|first=April|date=July 2019|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"air guitar\" gained popularity in the 1980s, with one of the first contests held at [[Florida State University]] in 1978. Contests multiplied in Sweden and the United States during the 1980s, and since 1996, the annual Air Guitar World Championships have been a part of the [[Oulu Music Video Festival]] in [[Oulu]], [[Finland]], and the festival currently administers the Air Guitar World Championships Network of official national championship competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airguitarworldchampionships.com|title=Air Guitar World Championships}}</ref> The idea of the contest was originally coined as a joke, meant only to be a side attraction for the music video festival, but has since become a major draw in its own right.<ref name=\"airguitarworldchampionships1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airguitarworldchampionships.com/2009/EN/history.html|title=Air Guitar World Championships 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822150518/http://www.airguitarworldchampionships.com/2009/EN/history.html|archivedate=August 22, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009 the Network consisted of twenty countries: [[Finland]], [[United States]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]], [[Greece]], [[Belgium]], [[Norway]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[Germany]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], and [[Brazil]].\n\n==Contests==\n[[File:20120824- MG 8352.jpg|thumb|Air Guitar Championship 2012 in Oulu]]\n[[File:Airguitar WC2010 1.JPG|thumb|Kevin \"Narvalwaker\" Leloux at the 2010 Air Guitar World Championships in Oulu, Finland]]\n{{Wikinews|Japanese man retains title at Air Guitar World Championship in Finland}}\nAir guitar contests have much in common with the old [[figure skating]] scoring system, especially using [[Figure skating#6.0 System|6.0 score system]]. The most common set of rules are as following:\n\n* Each participant has to play air guitar on stage in two rounds, each lasting for 1 minute.\n** Round 1: participant plays a selection of their own choosing.  Typically the song has been edited (or a medley has been created) to fit the 60-second format.\n** Round 2: participant plays a section of the song chosen by an organizer or competitor; usually the song is not announced beforehand and kept secret until the round begins, so a participant has to [[Improvisation|improvise]].\n* Participant plays alone; backing bands, either with real or air instruments are not allowed; [[Road crew|roadie]]s and [[groupie]]s are allowed to make up some image, but they have to leave the stage before performance.\n* Participant has to play air guitar (i.e. air drums, piano and other instruments are not allowed). Air guitar can be acoustic, electric or both.\n* Generally, there is no dress code and participant is encouraged to use any clothing and props that would add character and make the performance more interesting. However, any real musical equipment or crew (instruments, [[guitar amplifier|amplifiers]], [[Effects unit|effect pedal]]s, backing band members, etc.) are strictly forbidden. Some events make an exception for a real guitar pick, some don't.\n* Jury consists of independent judges, usually B-list musicians, music critics, comedians, or other members of the media.\n* Judges use the same 6.0 score system as in the traditional figure skating system: there are several varying criteria, and each judge must give the contestant a score from 4.0 to 6.0 on each of the following:\n** '''Technical merit'''\u2014how much the performance looks like the real playing, including accurate reproduction of all fretwork, chords, solos and technical moves.\n** '''Mimesmanship'''\u2014how convincingly the performer can [[mime]] their performance, and create the illusion of an invisible guitar, apart from the technical accuracy of the fretwork \n** '''Stage presence'''\u2014a [[charisma]] of rock star, the ability to rock, lack of stage fright and power to drive thousands of listeners; involves [[guitar showmanship]] and other emotional demonstrations.\n** '''Airness'''\u2014the most subjective criterion, as \"presentation\" in figure skating\u2014how much the performance was an object of [[art]] by itself, not only a simulation of playing guitar.\n\n===World===\n\n[[Image:Agworldchamps.png|right]]\nAnnual world championships, officially named \"The Annual Air Guitar World Championship Contest\", were first held in 1996 as part of the Oulu Music Video Festival in [[Oulu]], [[Finland]] and now held there annually in August. The ideology behind the event was that \"wars would end and all the bad things would go away if everyone just played air guitar.\"\n\nParticipants from all over the world competed in skills of playing air guitar. The judging panel included Finnish guitarist Juha Torvinen, and prizes included a custom made 'Flying Finn' guitar and [[Vox (musical equipment)|VOX BM Special amplifier]] donated by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]]. \n\n====List of World Championships====\n\n{| {{MedalistTable|type=Year|width=300}}\n|-\n|2019\n| {{flagIOCathlete|Rob \u201cThe Marquis\u201d Messel, Portland,

Provost, and ran initially for ten years until 2010. The first Australian champion was \u2018Super Dave'. There have been a number of unofficial competitions held in Australia.\n\nAustralians have claimed 2nd place three times and 3rd place three times at the Air Guitar World Championships.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2017, Australia has been represented at the Air Guitar World Championships a number of times through the Dark Horse Qualifiers, though has not had an official national champion.\n\nIn 2014 ABC Kids aired an episode of Whacky World Beaters, filmed on location at the Air Guitar World Championships in 2013.\n\nAir Guitar Australia was reformed in 2017 by Tom \"Sgt. Wrecker\" Hill, who has represented Australia four times at the Air Guitar World Championships. Air Guitar Australia launched at the Embassy of Finland at the Suomi 100 celebrations in September 2017. The competition was won by Jimmy Dangles who was presented with the Ronnie Riffless Memorial Trophy by Ambassador Lars Backstr\u00f6m. The 2018 Championship season saw competitors from NT, NSW, QLD, ACT, Victoria and WA qualifying at State and Territory Qualifiers in Canberra, Perth and Melbourne.

At the World Championships, C-Diddy emerged victorious, becoming the first American to win the title of World Air Guitar Champion. Jung and Crane were featured in the 2006 documentary [[Air Guitar Nation]], a film that documented their 2003 journey, from the United States to Finland.\n\nThe 2004 US Air Guitar Championships featured regional competitions in five cities. MiRi \"Sonyk-Rok\" Park, winner of the New York City regional, took the national crown by defeating Fatima \"The Rockness Monster\" Hoang from Los Angeles.

are currently two national air guitar championships running in the UK, both claiming status as the 'official' competition.\n\nThe UK Air Guitar Championships (UKAG) is the longest running air guitar championships in the world, established between 1994 and 1995 by Jeffrey Louis-Reed, and is still to this day the only Air Guitar Championships where the audience are the judges. It is also the only UK competition that tours the whole UK to find a true champion.\n\nThe similarly named, Air Guitar UK Championships (AGUK) was created in 2006 by two-time world Air Guitar champion Zac Monro. It originated over the issues of how to decide the competition (through the audience, or by a figure-skating style [[6.0 system|judging system]]), and over membership of the World Air Guitar Network (UKAG were unwilling to pay to participate in the World Championships, as their competition wished to remain free, which was the main cause of the creation of AGUK). However this is the only championship officially recognised as part of Air Guitar World Championships (AGWC)\n\nThe Air Guitar UK Championship was created in 2006 by twice air guitar world champion Zac 'the Magnet' Monroe (the first non-Finn to win the competition<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,544692,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=My week: Zac Monro}}</ref>) and is affiliated with the Air Guitar World Championships in [[Oulu]], [[Finland]], forming part of the [[Air guitar#Official Air Guitar World Championships Network Countries|World Air Guitar Network]].\n\nIn September 2011, Air Guitar UK launched Air Guitar Wales and Air Guitar Northern Ireland to join Air Guitar Scotland (first launched by AGUK in 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/air-way-to-heaven-for-guitarists-1.981574 |title=Air-way to heaven for &apos;guitarists&apos; (From Evening Times) |publisher=Eveningtimes.co.uk |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2017-08-21}}</ref>) as part of the Air Guitar UK Network.\n\nThe first official Championship was held in August 2006 at the Academy Islington, London, and was won by Gabi \u201cThe Hoxton Creeper\u201d Matzeu, who was sent to Finland as the UK's 1st Official Champion.\n\nIn 2007, in the run-up to release of the cult Film [[Air Guitar Nation]], the second Championship played once again to a full house at the Academy. It was held at the Academy until 2010, and in 2011 moved to The Garage, Islington.\n\nAir Guitar UK events are held in support of the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]]. Air Guitar is considered a force for good, and in the absence of world peace this is at least something.\n\nAll profits from all of the Air Guitar UK events are donated to the Teenage Cancer Trust (www.teenagecancertrust.org).\n\nAGUK's official site can be found at https://web.archive.org/web/20070216235714/http://www.airguitaruk.com/\n\n====UKAG====\n\nThe UK Air Guitar Championships were founded in the upstairs of a pub called 'The Pig in Paradise' which is in central Brighton, England. The UK Air Guitar championships annually hosts regional championships in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the north and south of England to find the best competitors from the UK and bring them to the national final stage to battle for crown of UK Air Guitar Champion\n\nFarmer John AKA Doozer McDooze won the 2004 UK air guitar championship.\n\nChristopher 'Crispy' Vearncombe won the competition in 2005, but was killed in a road traffic accident in South Africa weeks before the 2006 competition. His many friends hold an annual charity music festival in his memory. [[Crispystock]] is held in his home town of Andover, Hampshire. Next came Colin 'Cozza' Fulker who won 2006, 2007 and 2008 to become one of the UKAG's most successful champions.\n\n2009 saw Declan Gillick aka 'Deku Chan' win the competition. It was also the first year that drinks manufacturer WKD sponsored the competition.\n\n2010 - UKAG returned to London for the national final; the winner of the southern England heat, 'Eddie Six Strings' aka Sophie Aymonier, wriggled her way into the final and beat 'Juan Nightstand' to become the first ever female UK Air Guitar Champion.\n\nMany air bands were founded in Brighton in the late 90s with acts such as 'Dum BN3', 'PISS', Satans underpants and 'Triple Slash'. There were many more who all took part in the UK Air Guitar Championships and a few of them won.\n\nUKAG work's regularly with various charities including RAFA, The 1800 Club and Action Medical Research\n\nWebsite: http://www.ukairguitar.com\n\n==Innovations==\n\nThere are multiple technological innovations that try to allow air guitar to be played as a real instrument, producing sounds that depend on air guitarist's actions.\n\nIn 2005, students from the [[Aalto University School of Science and Technology|Helsinki University of Technology]] developed a system that translates hand movements into electric guitar sounds, resulting in a functional air guitar.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8383 | title = Air guitarists' rock dreams come true | first = Will | last = Knight | publisher = [[New Scientist]] | date = 28 November 2005 | access-date = 31 May 2008}}</ref> The system, consisting of a pair of brightly coloured gloves and an infrared camera, is one of the most popular exhibits at the Helsinki Science Center. The camera recognizes the distance between the two gloves as well as strumming movements made by the wearer to synthesize an electric guitar tune, working using only six notes.\n\nIn November 2006, researchers at the [[Australia]]n government's [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] announced they had developed a T-shirt that senses human movement to \"showcase its expertise in designing and manufacturing electronic and intelligent textiles with which people effortlessly control computers\", publicising it as an air guitar shirt.<ref>{{cite news\n|url = http://www.csiro.au/science/AirGuitar.html\n|title = It's not rocket science... it's rockin' science\n|first = Richard\n|last = Helmer\n|publisher = [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]]\n|date = 13 November 2006\n|accessdate = 31 May 2008\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517141701/http://www.csiro.au/science/AirGuitar.html| archivedate= 17 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|url = http://www.csiro.au/news/ps2gl.html\n|title = Every wanna-be rocker's fantasy comes true\n|date = 13 November 2006\n|accessdate = 31 May 2008\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517074456/http://www.csiro.au/news/ps2gl.html| archivedate= 17 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, toy company [[Silverlit]] introduced V-Beat Air Guitar, an air guitar gadget. The three-part device consists of a motion-sensing guitar pick, a neck part with four buttons and a guitar body. By changing the distance between body and neck and pressing a combination of the four buttons on the neck part, up to 48 tones and chords can be played. The V-Beat Air Guitar was won 'Best Music Gadget' on the television program The Gadget Show.<ref>{{cite web\n |title= Play some real guitar.

He was seen playing the Tomy Guitar Rockstar in one of Top Gear's famous challenges.\n\nIn March 2008, [[Jada Toys]] of California introduced the Air Guitar Rocker toy which featured patented technology in a belt buckle. When the user strums a magnetic pick in front of the belt buckle, guitar music plays through a portable amp attached to the users pant or belt. The Air Guitar Rocker is marketed with the popular [[Guitar Hero]] license and was created by toy inventor David F\u00fchrer and his team.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frets Afire: The Three Leading Air-Guitar Toys|url=http://www.brandweek.com/bw/magazine/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003711866|date=February 18, 2008}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, San Francisco, CA startup [[Yobble]] announced the Air Guitar Move, an [[appcessory]] for iPhone and iPod Touch.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Users holds the iPhone in one hand and a motion sensing guitar pick in the other. Based on the motions of both hands, the Air Guitar Move software is able to recognize air guitar movements. The bundled game is a mix of [[Guitar Hero]] and [[Dance Central]].

May purchased a set of [[Burns London|Burns]] [[Burns Tri-Sonic|Tri-Sonic]] pick-ups and covered the coils of two with [[Araldite]] [[epoxy]] to reduce [[microphonics]]. The middle pickup remained uncoated and this is understood to have been modified in the early 1980s when [[DiMarzio]] examined the Red Special when designing pickups for the first Guild replica. The magnet was turned over to change its polarity and the wires on the solder posts swapped (to mimic a reverse wound coil) which made his favoured pickup combination of bridge and middle in phase [[humbucking]]. He originally wound his own pick-ups, as he had for his first guitar, but he did not like the resulting sound because of the polarity of these pick-ups: alternating North-South instead of all North.\n\nThe [[Vibrato systems for guitar|tremolo system]] is made from an old hardened-steel knife-edge shaped into a V and two motorbike [[poppet valve|valve]] springs to counter the 79 lbs string tension. The tension of the springs can be adjusted by screwing the bolts, which run through the middle of the springs, in or out via two small access holes next to the rear strap button. To reduce friction, the bridge was completed with rollers to allow the strings to return perfectly in tune after using the tremolo arm (the arm itself was from a bicycle saddlebag holder with a plastic knitting needle tip).<ref name=Grdn2014/> For the same reason, at the other end of the neck the strings pass over a [[zero fret]] and through a [[bakelite]] string guide.\n\nOriginally the guitar had a built-in distortion circuit, adapted from a mid-1960s [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] distortion [[effects unit]]. The switch for this was in front of the phase switches. May soon discovered that he preferred the sound of a [[Vox AC30]] distorting at full power, so the circuit was removed. The switch hole is now covered by a mother-of-pearl star inlay, but was originally covered by insulation tape.\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Brian May playing the Red Special in [[Frankfurt]] on 19 April 2005, during the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour]]]]\nMay still uses the original but he has used replicas in some performances. Two notable occasions on which the original guitar was not used were in the videos \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", and \"[[Spread Your Wings]]\", using his John-Birch-made Red Special copy (see Replicas section below) which differs from the original in its all-maple construction and natural maple color, since he did not want to expose the Red Special to snow. The Birch was also used live as a back-up for the Red Special until it was destroyed by May. He also opted not to use the Red Special for the \"[[Play the Game (song)|Play the Game]]\" video, instead using a budget Satellite-badged replica of a [[Fender Stratocaster]], since at one point in the video, Queen singer [[Freddie Mercury]] would snatch the guitar from May and \"throw\" it back to him. Another video that did not feature the Red Special was \"[[Princes of the Universe]]\", where May used a white [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR11V]] (for reasons unknown, and this guitar is often mistaken for a [[Jackson Randy Rhoads]]). He also recorded the original of \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\" on Queen drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]]'s [[Fender Esquire]] but performed the accompanying video and live performances of the song until 1992 with a [[Fender Telecaster]].<ref>Blackett, Matt. \"Renaissance Man.\" Guitar Player Magazine Jan. 2008: 92.

The guitar differs from the original in its all-maple construction and natural finish except for the back which is gold finished. After its destruction May sent the guitar to American luthier John Page, who kept the remains for over 20 years before sending them back to May. May then had the guitar glued back together by Andrew Guyton and still owns it, however it hardly functions anymore.\n\nOther official replicas of the Red Special have been manufactured in varying numbers and in multiple models (i.e. a higher-end full-featured model, and a lower-cost one lacking some of the intricacies of the former) several times during the 1980s and '90s, most often by the [[Guild Guitar Company]] from 1983\u201385 and again from 1993\u201395, and by Burns Guitars from 2001 (mass-produced models made in Korea). The Burns model, produced with guidance from May, was awarded \"Best Electric Guitar of the Year 2001\" by [[Guitarist (magazine)|''Guitarist'' Magazine]].<ref name=\"Gj\u00f6rde62\">{{cite book |last=Gj\u00f6rde |first=Per |title=Pearls and Crazy Diamonds |publisher=Addit Information AB |year=2001 |location=G\u00f6teborg, Sweden |pages=62\u201363}}</ref> Currently, only Brian May Guitars (taking over manufacture from Burns) manufacture authorised replicas, the Special at a budget price point and the Super Mk2 at a higher price point aimed at enthusiasts.\n\nKZ Guitar Works manufactured the original Red Special Super model which was hand-made in Japan by master luthier Kazutaka Ijuin. This model has been discontinued and production of the revised Super model taken up in the Czech Republic for Brian May Guitars.\n\nThe Brian May Guitars version differs from the Burns original in several ways; for example, the tremolo was a two-point synchronised tremolo with rear access plate. These models also feature a half-moon scratch plate behind the bridge to emulate the original. The switches were also changed from black to white to match May's guitar. They still use the Burns Tri-Sonic pick-ups. 24 guitars were made in a rare baby blue color with a pearloid pickguard and gold hardware. The guitars come in Antique Cherry (a similar color to that of the Red Special), White and 3-Tone Sunburst with chrome hardware. They also have Honey Sunburst, Black and Gold with gold hardware and other various finishes.\n\nGreg Fryer, of Fryer Guitars<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fryerguitars.com/|title=Fryer Guitars|website=www.fryerguitars.com|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref> an Australian luthier, produced three replicas of the Red Special in 1996/97, and with permission from May, made exhaustive measurements of the original guitar.<ref name=\"restoration-1998\">{{cite web|url=https://fryerguitars.wordpress.com/red-special-restoration-1998/|title=Red Special restoration 1998|author=|date=30 January 2014|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"theredspecial.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theredspecial.com/2017/05/the-red-special-new-picture-10/|title=The Red Special \u2013 New Picture #10 \u2013 The Red Special|author=|date=|website=www.theredspecial.com|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"hackaday.com\">{{cite web|url=https://hackaday.com/2017/06/13/the-red-special-brian-mays-handmade-guitar/|title=The Red Special: Brian May\u2019s Handmade Guitar|author=|date=13 June 2017|website=hackaday.com|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> Fryer named his three replicas [[John Lennon|John]], [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[George Burns]] (after two members of [[The Beatles]] and the famous American comedian).

While the woods used in John and Paul are more faithful to the original, George Burns was built with [[Pterocarpus indicus|New Guinea rosewood]]<ref name=\"JohnPaulGeorge\">{{cite web |title=Greg Fryer's Red Special Replicas |publisher=\"Guitarist magazine via Brian May World web site\" |url=http://www.brianmayworld.com/replicas.htm |accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref> for a \"more aggressive edge\" tonally. John is May's main back-up Red Special, and is tuned to standard. His green Guyton has replaced George Burns for [[Drop D tuning]] duties to play \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\" live.\n\nIn 2004, Andrew Guyton of Guyton Guitars,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/|title=Guyton Guitars|website=Guyton Guitars|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref> a luthier in the UK, manufactured 50 authorised, limited edition replicas of the Red Special: 40 in red to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the guitar, and ten in green, as he had previously seen a green Guild copy that he liked.<ref>[http://www.brianmaycentral.net/guyton.html Guyton Red Special Guitars] Brian May Central.

This was done in 2003 at [[St. Bartholomews Hospital]] in London.

In 2017, the \"Mini May\" was upsized with a 22 3/4\" scale neck.\n\nAn acoustic guitar, featuring a 24-fret neck and the body outline of the Red Special went into production in 2007. This model is named the \"Rhapsody\", after the Queen song \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".\n\nA bass guitar called the ''Bri-Bass'' was announced on May's website and is available. It looks like his normal guitar but with four bass strings. It features a bound mahogany body and 31.5\" scale neck, topped with a 20-fret ebony fingerboard. Pickups are a [[Gibson EB-0]] type chrome-covered humbucking neck pick-up and a rear-position single coil pick-up hooked up to a passive volume/volume/tone circuit.\n\nThe Guild models of the early 1990s featured three major configurations. Of the three, the \"Signature\" model was closest to May's guitar, although it was made of mahogany (body and neck) and ebony (fingerboard) and sported Trisonic-styled \"Brian May\" pick-ups made by Seymour Duncan and hardware (including the unique bridge) from Schaller. The \"Special\" model featured a stop-tailpiece rather than a vibrato, the middle pick-up was moved back next to the bridge pick-up for a humbucking look, and the back of the guitar had no binding. The \"Standard\" model featured a more common Strat-style 5-way pick-up selector switch, a longer scale neck, and a deeper headstock angle. Andrew Guyton made May a double-neck version, which has never been a production model.\n\n==Restoration==\n\nAfter viewing the replicas and taking note of the wear and tear the Red Special had suffered during nearly 30 years of constant touring, May had Fryer restore the original Red Special in 1998 using as much original and time-period specific material as possible.<ref name=\"restoration-1998\"/><ref name=\"theredspecial.com\"/><ref name=\"hackaday.com\"/> Damaged veneer on the back of the guitar was removed and new pieces scarfed in. The binding was removed and various nicks and dents in the top were repaired. Fryer re-finished the neck and body in the original Rustin's Plastic Coating used in the creation over the existing finish, and fretboard wear was repaired and dot-markers replaced. The original electrics were also re-wired and overhauled, and cosmetic work was done, such as filling in holes and worn areas on access panels, pick-up covers (worn by May's use of a [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] as opposed to a standard [[plectrum]]) and the front scratchplate.\n\nThe restored Red Special is prominently featured during a series of video interviews with ''[[Guitarist (magazine)|Guitarist]]'' in 1999, in which May also demonstrated its delay{{clarify|date=January 2016}} capabilities.<ref>[https:https://www.getbeststrings.com/best-way-to-learn-guitar-on-your-own/: \"Best Way To Learn Guitar On Your Own\"] on Blog.</ref>{date=March 2020}\n\nAt the end of the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tour in 2005, May had several revisions made to the original Red Special, including having the [[zero fret]] replaced for the first time (this had been judged unnecessary at the time of the 1998 restoration) and making a larger opening for a new, modern 1/4\" jack socket. Despite all of this work, the original frets (other than the zero fret) have never been replaced.\n\nAndrew Guyton of Guyton Guitars, carried out a limited restoration in April 2016 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/blog/the-original-red-special-guyton-red-special-for-sale-and-imminent-badger-making-of-video|title=The Original Red Special, Guyton Red Special for sale and imminent Badger 'making of' video.|author=|date=|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref>. This work involved making good all the cracks in the Rustins Plastic Coating lacquer finish, repairing damage to the end and edge, and touching in of the fretboard and replacing one of the mother-of-pearl marker dots. Various parts, including the tremolo and bridge assembly were removed, serviced, cleaned and lubricated then refitted. The zero fret was also replaced again.\n\n==Unusual features==\n'''Series wiring''' \n:The pick-ups are wired in series rather than the more usual parallel configuration. The output is also added together when wired in series, meaning that with all three pick-ups turned on, the output is tripled.\n'''On/Off switches''' \n:Each pick-up has its own dedicated on/off switch. This allows for the additional pick-up combinations of \"all three on\" and \"neck and bridge on\", combinations not commonly available on three pick-up guitars.\n'''Phase switches''' \n:Each pick-up has a phase switch which reverses the pick-up wiring, therefore reversing the phase of the signal from the pick-up. This means that when more than one pick-up is active and one has the phase reversed, the resultant tone is what remains after the signal common to the two pick-ups is cancelled out, and only the differences from pick-up position remain.\n'''Controls''' \n:The position of the volume and tone controls is transposed compared to most guitars, with the tone being nearest the pick-ups and the volume furthest away.\n'''Tremolo''' \n:The tremolo (known as a knife-edge tremolo) is unique and was designed by May and his father. The knife-edge acts as a fulcrum on which the tremolo block, or tailpiece, pivots.\n\n==Specifications==\n'''Body'''\n*Oak from an old table and blockboard (with a mahogany veneer), semi-solid body\n*Depth: 1 9/16\" (40&nbsp;mm)\n'''Neck'''\n*Bolt on, one large bolt which sits beneath the fingerboard and goes through a hole in the body then a nut is then attached; it is also screwed down by two wood screws at the tenon end which ends just before the bridge pick-up.

He originally wound his own pick-ups, as he had for his first guitar, but he did not like the resulting sound because of the polarity of these pick-ups: alternating North-South instead of all North.\n\nThe [[Vibrato systems for guitar|tremolo system]] is made from an old hardened-steel knife-edge shaped into a V and two motorbike [[poppet valve|valve]] springs to counter the 79 lbs string tension. The tension of the springs can be adjusted by screwing the bolts, which run through the middle of the springs, in or out via two small access holes next to the rear strap button. To reduce friction, the bridge was completed with rollers to allow the strings to return perfectly in tune after using the tremolo arm (the arm itself was from a bicycle saddlebag holder with a plastic knitting needle tip).<ref name=Grdn2014/> For the same reason, at the other end of the neck the strings pass over a [[zero fret]] and through a [[bakelite]] string guide.\n\nOriginally the guitar had a built-in distortion circuit, adapted from a mid-1960s [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] distortion [[effects unit]]. The switch for this was in front of the phase switches. May soon discovered that he preferred the sound of a [[Vox AC30]] distorting at full power, so the circuit was removed. The switch hole is now covered by a mother-of-pearl star inlay, but was originally covered by insulation tape.\n\n==Appearances==\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Brian May playing the Red Special in [[Frankfurt]] on 19 April 2005, during the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour]]]]\nMay still uses the original but he has used replicas in some performances. Two notable occasions on which the original guitar was not used were in the videos \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", and \"[[Spread Your Wings]]\", using his John-Birch-made Red Special copy (see Replicas section below) which differs from the original in its all-maple construction and natural maple color, since he did not want to expose the Red Special to snow. The Birch was also used live as a back-up for the Red Special until it was destroyed by May. He also opted not to use the Red Special for the \"[[Play the Game (song)|Play the Game]]\" video, instead using a budget Satellite-badged replica of a [[Fender Stratocaster]], since at one point in the video, Queen singer [[Freddie Mercury]] would snatch the guitar from May and \"throw\" it back to him. Another video that did not feature the Red Special was \"[[Princes of the Universe]]\", where May used a white [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR11V]] (for reasons unknown, and this guitar is often mistaken for a [[Jackson Randy Rhoads]]). He also recorded the original of \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\" on Queen drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]]'s [[Fender Esquire]] but performed the accompanying video and live performances of the song until 1992 with a [[Fender Telecaster]].<ref>Blackett, Matt. \"Renaissance Man.\" Guitar Player Magazine Jan. 2008: 92.

The guitar differs from the original in its all-maple construction and natural finish except for the back which is gold finished. After its destruction May sent the guitar to American luthier John Page, who kept the remains for over 20 years before sending them back to May. May then had the guitar glued back together by Andrew Guyton and still owns it, however it hardly functions anymore.\n\nOther official replicas of the Red Special have been manufactured in varying numbers and in multiple models (i.e. a higher-end full-featured model, and a lower-cost one lacking some of the intricacies of the former) several times during the 1980s and '90s, most often by the [[Guild Guitar Company]] from 1983\u201385 and again from 1993\u201395, and by Burns Guitars from 2001 (mass-produced models made in Korea). The Burns model, produced with guidance from May, was awarded \"Best Electric Guitar of the Year 2001\" by [[Guitarist (magazine)|''Guitarist'' Magazine]].<ref name=\"Gj\u00f6rde62\">{{cite book |last=Gj\u00f6rde |first=Per |title=Pearls and Crazy Diamonds |publisher=Addit Information AB |year=2001 |location=G\u00f6teborg, Sweden |pages=62\u201363}}</ref> Currently, only Brian May Guitars (taking over manufacture from Burns) manufacture authorised replicas, the Special at a budget price point and the Super Mk2 at a higher price point aimed at enthusiasts.\n\nKZ Guitar Works manufactured the original Red Special Super model which was hand-made in Japan by master luthier Kazutaka Ijuin. This model has been discontinued and production of the revised Super model taken up in the Czech Republic for Brian May Guitars.\n\nThe Brian May Guitars version differs from the Burns original in several ways; for example, the tremolo was a two-point synchronised tremolo with rear access plate. These models also feature a half-moon scratch plate behind the bridge to emulate the original. The switches were also changed from black to white to match May's guitar. They still use the Burns Tri-Sonic pick-ups. 24 guitars were made in a rare baby blue color with a pearloid pickguard and gold hardware. The guitars come in Antique Cherry (a similar color to that of the Red Special), White and 3-Tone Sunburst with chrome hardware. They also have Honey Sunburst, Black and Gold with gold hardware and other various finishes.\n\nGreg Fryer, of Fryer Guitars<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fryerguitars.com/|title=Fryer Guitars|website=www.fryerguitars.com|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref> an Australian luthier, produced three replicas of the Red Special in 1996/97, and with permission from May, made exhaustive measurements of the original guitar.<ref name=\"restoration-1998\">{{cite web|url=https://fryerguitars.wordpress.com/red-special-restoration-1998/|title=Red Special restoration 1998|author=|date=30 January 2014|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"theredspecial.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theredspecial.com/2017/05/the-red-special-new-picture-10/|title=The Red Special \u2013 New Picture #10 \u2013 The Red Special|author=|date=|website=www.theredspecial.com|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"hackaday.com\">{{cite web|url=https://hackaday.com/2017/06/13/the-red-special-brian-mays-handmade-guitar/|title=The Red Special: Brian May\u2019s Handmade Guitar|author=|date=13 June 2017|website=hackaday.com|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> Fryer named his three replicas [[John Lennon|John]], [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[George Burns]] (after two members of [[The Beatles]] and the famous American comedian). May has two of these guitars, John and George Burns; Fryer kept Paul for some years and used it for testing modified Vox AC30 amplifiers and his range of treble boosters until he sold it to a Japanese collector for an undisclosed sum. While the woods used in John and Paul are more faithful to the original, George Burns was built with [[Pterocarpus indicus|New Guinea rosewood]]<ref name=\"JohnPaulGeorge\">{{cite web |title=Greg Fryer's Red Special Replicas |publisher=\"Guitarist magazine via Brian May World web site\" |url=http://www.brianmayworld.com/replicas.htm |accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref> for a \"more aggressive edge\" tonally. John is May's main back-up Red Special, and is tuned to standard. His green Guyton has replaced George Burns for [[Drop D tuning]] duties to play \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\" live.\n\nIn 2004, Andrew Guyton of Guyton Guitars,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/|title=Guyton Guitars|website=Guyton Guitars|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref> a luthier in the UK, manufactured 50 authorised, limited edition replicas of the Red Special: 40 in red to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the guitar, and ten in green, as he had previously seen a green Guild copy that he liked.<ref>[http://www.brianmaycentral.net/guyton.html Guyton Red Special Guitars] Brian May Central. Retrieved 17 August 2011</ref> Pete Malandrone, May's [[guitar technician]] suggested having X-ray images made of the original guitar to allow more accurate reproduction of the internal chambers. This was done in 2003 at [[St. Bartholomews Hospital]] in London. May has since commissioned Guyton to make several other Red Special variants, e.g. with a [[scalloped fretboard]], a [[double-neck]] and an [[arch top]] [[semi-acoustic]].\n\n=== Unofficial replicas ===\n\nIn the 1970s, Japanese guitar manufacturer [[Greco_guitars|Greco]] was the first company to market a line of mass produced Red Special copies, albeit unofficial and unlicensed.

In 2017, the \"Mini May\" was upsized with a 22 3/4\" scale neck.\n\nAn acoustic guitar, featuring a 24-fret neck and the body outline of the Red Special went into production in 2007. This model is named the \"Rhapsody\", after the Queen song \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".\n\nA bass guitar called the ''Bri-Bass'' was announced on May's website and is available. It looks like his normal guitar but with four bass strings. It features a bound mahogany body and 31.5\" scale neck, topped with a 20-fret ebony fingerboard. Pickups are a [[Gibson EB-0]] type chrome-covered humbucking neck pick-up and a rear-position single coil pick-up hooked up to a passive volume/volume/tone circuit.\n\nThe Guild models of the early 1990s featured three major configurations. Of the three, the \"Signature\" model was closest to May's guitar, although it was made of mahogany (body and neck) and ebony (fingerboard) and sported Trisonic-styled \"Brian May\" pick-ups made by Seymour Duncan and hardware (including the unique bridge) from Schaller. The \"Special\" model featured a stop-tailpiece rather than a vibrato, the middle pick-up was moved back next to the bridge pick-up for a humbucking look, and the back of the guitar had no binding. The \"Standard\" model featured a more common Strat-style 5-way pick-up selector switch, a longer scale neck, and a deeper headstock angle. Andrew Guyton made May a double-neck version, which has never been a production model.\n\n==Restoration==\n\nAfter viewing the replicas and taking note of the wear and tear the Red Special had suffered during nearly 30 years of constant touring, May had Fryer restore the original Red Special in 1998 using as much original and time-period specific material as possible.<ref name=\"restoration-1998\"/><ref name=\"theredspecial.com\"/><ref name=\"hackaday.com\"/> Damaged veneer on the back of the guitar was removed and new pieces scarfed in. The binding was removed and various nicks and dents in the top were repaired. Fryer re-finished the neck and body in the original Rustin's Plastic Coating used in the creation over the existing finish, and fretboard wear was repaired and dot-markers replaced. The original electrics were also re-wired and overhauled, and cosmetic work was done, such as filling in holes and worn areas on access panels, pick-up covers (worn by May's use of a [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] as opposed to a standard [[plectrum]]) and the front scratchplate.\n\nThe restored Red Special is prominently featured during a series of video interviews with ''[[Guitarist (magazine)|Guitarist]]'' in 1999, in which May also demonstrated its delay{{clarify|date=January 2016}} capabilities.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCP_1ddfkPc Guitarist: \"Brian May on Guitar\"] on YouTube.</ref>{{Dead link|date=April 2019}}\n\nAt the end of the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tour in 2005, May had several revisions made to the original Red Special, including having the [[zero fret]] replaced for the first time (this had been judged unnecessary at the time of the 1998 restoration) and making a larger opening for a new, modern 1/4\" jack socket. Despite all of this work, the original frets (other than the zero fret) have never been replaced.\n\nAndrew Guyton of Guyton Guitars, carried out a limited restoration in April 2016 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/blog/the-original-red-special-guyton-red-special-for-sale-and-imminent-badger-making-of-video|title=The Original Red Special, Guyton Red Special for sale and imminent Badger 'making of' video.|author=|date=|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref>. This work involved making good all the cracks in the Rustins Plastic Coating lacquer finish, repairing damage to the end and edge, and touching in of the fretboard and replacing one of the mother-of-pearl marker dots. Various parts, including the tremolo and bridge assembly were removed, serviced, cleaned and lubricated then refitted. The zero fret was also replaced again.\n\n==Unusual features==\n'''Series wiring''' \n:The pick-ups are wired in series rather than the more usual parallel configuration. The output is also added together when wired in series, meaning that with all three pick-ups turned on, the output is tripled.\n'''On/Off switches''' \n:Each pick-up has its own dedicated on/off switch. This allows for the additional pick-up combinations of \"all three on\" and \"neck and bridge on\", combinations not commonly available on three pick-up guitars.\n'''Phase switches''' \n:Each pick-up has a phase switch which reverses the pick-up wiring, therefore reversing the phase of the signal from the pick-up. This means that when more than one pick-up is active and one has the phase reversed, the resultant tone is what remains after the signal common to the two pick-ups is cancelled out, and only the differences from pick-up position remain.\n'''Controls''' \n:The position of the volume and tone controls is transposed compared to most guitars, with the tone being nearest the pick-ups and the volume furthest away.\n'''Tremolo''' \n:The tremolo (known as a knife-edge tremolo) is unique and was designed by May and his father. The knife-edge acts as a fulcrum on which the tremolo block, or tailpiece, pivots.\n\n==Specifications==\n'''Body'''\n*Oak from an old table and blockboard (with a mahogany veneer), semi-solid body\n*Depth: 1 9/16\" (40&nbsp;mm)\n'''Neck'''\n*Bolt on, one large bolt which sits beneath the fingerboard and goes through a hole in the body then a nut is then attached; it is also screwed down by two wood screws at the tenon end which ends just before the bridge pick-up.

In his youth, he was an introverted child and spent most of his time in his room, which was filled with comic books, games, martial-arts movie memorabilia, and toys. He also spent a lot of time at Disneyland.<ref name=\"MTV.com\"/>\n\nCarroll began playing guitar at the age of 12. He learned how to play from an elderly man who lived down the road, who died before Carroll moved. He had been quoted as saying, however, that he did not become serious until a year later when he moved from [[Huntington Beach, California]] to [[Claremont, California|Claremont]]. His playing began improving by taking private lessons from various teachers at a local music store. His early teachers included Max McGuire, Johnny Fortune, Mark Hammond, Pebber Brown, [[Joey Tafolla]] and [[Paul Gilbert]]. Buckethead played a tribute to all his early teachers when the Deli Creeps played a show at Styles Music's 25th anniversary. He then began making demo recordings of both his playing as well as his writing styles, which would later be released in 2007\u20132008.\n\nThe Buckethead persona came to be when Carroll saw the 1988 [[horror movie]] ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers|Halloween 4]]'' and was inspired by the film. He went out right after seeing it and bought a Michael Myers-like white mask.

Though available only as a pricey import, the record received positive reviews and earned some attention. At about this time, Buckethead fell into the orbit of prolific bassist/producer [[Bill Laswell]], himself an occasional Zorn collaborator; Buckethead (as a performer, producer, or composer) was introduced to Laswell with the help of Limbomaniacs drummer [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan \"Brain\" Mantia]], who gave Laswell a video of Buckethead playing in his room.<ref>[http://www.tedkurland.com/pbuild/linkbuilder.cfm?selection=doc.271] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215182308/http://www.tedkurland.com/pbuild/linkbuilder.cfm?selection=doc.271 |date=December 15, 2006 }}</ref> Buckethead soon became Laswell's second staple guitar player, besides [[Nicky Skopelitis]].\n\nIn 1992, Buckethead, with Bill Laswell, [[Bernie Worrell]], [[Bootsy Collins]], and [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan \"Brain\" Mantia]], formed the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]].

The final track, \"Nottingham Lace,\" was first made public via his home page and soon became a concert staple and one of his most popular songs. Buckethead also released two further solo albums in 2005, ''[[Kaleidoscalp]]'' and ''Inbred Mountain''\u2014the latter being the first album as a solo artist released on the label TDRS Music. Both albums originally were sold exclusively at concerts and only later got an official release through the label's website.\n\nBuckethead released albums with other bands that year: with [[Cornbugs]], he released two compilation albums, called ''[[Rest Home for Robots]]'' and ''Skeleton Farm''. Gorgone's ''self titled album'' was released that year' itself based upon recording sessions from the album ''[[Population Override]]'' that Buckethead released in 2004.\n\n{{Listen\n |filename     = Buckethead - Jordan (GH2 Version).ogg\n |title        = Excerpt of \"Jordan\"\n |description  = First two bars of \"Jordan\"\n |header = Main guitar riff of \"Jordan\"\n}}\n\nIn 2006 the cross-console video game ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'' was launched, featuring Buckethead's song \"[[Jordan (Buckethead composition)|Jordan]]\" as an unlockable bonus track. Although the song has been performed live in the past, the video game version is the only known studio recording of the song.

The DVD also contains three complete [[Deli Creeps]] shows, a sound check, backstage footage, and solo footage of just Buckethead. He also released the albums ''The Elephant Man's Alarm Clock'' and ''[[Crime Slunk Scene]]'', both sold on his tours but later sold on the TDRS Music website. The last album has the song \"Soothsayer (Dedicated to Aunt Suzie)\"; this song (along with \"Jordan\" and \"Nottingham Lace\") is one of his most popular songs and is often played live. Buckethead released his final compilation album with the band [[Cornbugs]], called ''Celebrity Psychos''. He also released an album with [[Travis Dickerson]], called ''Chicken Noodles'', a move that would see the start of a four-year long collaboration with the keyboardist.

In February, a box set titled ''[[In Search of The]]'', containing 13 albums of original material, was released. It was handcrafted, numbered, and monogrammed by Buckethead and contained over nine hours of music. A regular solo album, called ''Pepper's Ghost'', was released in March. A disc of acoustic improvisations called ''[[Acoustic Shards]]'' was also released, becoming the twentieth studio album that the artist had released so far in his solo career. In midyear, he reissued his demo tape ''Bucketheadland Blueprints'', with two alternative album covers: a special edition with a hand-drawn cover made by him, or a standard edition with the original cover art. In October, he released his final two albums of the year, called  ''Decoding the Tomb of Bansheebot'' and ''Cyborg Slunks''. The latter again came in both a hand-drawn limited edition and (some weeks later) as a normal CD. Buckethead wrote three songs dedicated to Aunt Suzie in 2006-07: the aforementioned \u201cSoothsayer\u201d (Crime Slunk Scene), \u201cAunt Suzie\u201d (Cyborg Slunks), and \u201cSail On Soothsayer\u201d, (Decoding The Tomb Of Bansheebot).\n\nAs ''Death Cube K'', Buckethead released two albums in 2007: an album called DCK, limited to 400 hand-numbered copies and released in August; and in December, the 5-CD box set ''Monolith'', which consisted of one unbroken track per CD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://travisdickersonmusic.com/store/monolith.html |title=Monolith |publisher=Travisdickersonmusic.com |accessdate=2012-02-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206184107/http://travisdickersonmusic.com/store/monolith.html |archivedate=February 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring 2007, Buckethead also collaborated and appeared on numerous albums with other artists.

Their first album, called ''[[Living on Another Frequency]]'', was delayed several times and was finally released in November 2008.\n[[File:Wakarusa 2008.jpg|thumbnail|right|Buckethead live at [[Wakarusa Music and Camping Festival|Wakarusa]], 2008]]\nOn January 1, 2008, the band [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]] released the long-awaited album ''[[Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness)]]'' in Japan. The album had actually been recorded in 2005, but had to be put on hold when the original label went bankrupt. That year Buckethead released ''[[From the Coop]]'' through the label Avabella (where he released ''Acoustic Shards''), consisting of the demos Buckethead gave to Jas Obrecht back in 1988. This CD also included the first ever \"official\" biography of/by the artist. Later that same year, he announced the release of the album called ''Albino Slug'' (a tour-only CD until official release on December of the same year). Along with this album, he appeared on the album ''The Dragons of Eden'', with Dickerson and Mantia, and in collaboration with [[That 1 Guy]] as the ''Frankenstein Brothers'', an album called ''[[Bolt on Neck]]'' was released. [[That 1 Guy]] and Buckethead toured together through fall 2008, playing songs from this album.\n\nBuckethead also appeared in the [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[American Music: Off the Record]]'', in which he appears only playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0887710/ |title=American Music: Off the Record (2008) |publisher=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-29}}</ref> [[Serj Tankian]]'s label, [[Serjical Strike]], reissued the album ''[[Enter the Chicken]]'' with an extra song.

Other influences include martial artist and actor [[Bruce Lee]] (on \"The Game of Death\" song and inspiration behind the use of nunchakus on stage), author [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (on the \"Lurker at the Threshold\" suite), numerous [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] TV shows and movies including ''[[Little House on the Prairie]]'', [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s ''[[The Holy Mountain (1973 film)|The Holy Mountain]]'' (on [[Kaleidoscalp]]), and ''[[Giant Robo (tokusatsu)|Giant Robo]]t'' (mentioned on several songs, albums, and episodes shown on stage).<ref name=\"Buckethead FAQ\" /> [[Disney]] and [[Disneyland]] are also major influences on Buckethead's career.<ref name=\"Buckknows\" /> Buckethead is also inspired by Japanese filmmaker [[Takashi Miike]], to whom a song on Pepper's Ghost is dedicated. ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' franchise of movies is also a big inspiration to him and he has written many songs such as Jowls, which are heavily inspired by those movies. The song \"To Infinity and Beyond\" from ''Out Orbit'' was dedicated to then-recently deceased basketball reporter [[Craig

In his youth, he was an introverted child and spent most of his time in his room, which was filled with comic books, games, martial-arts movie memorabilia, and toys. He also spent a lot of time at Disneyland.<ref name=\"MTV.com\"/>\n\nCarroll began playing guitar at the age of 12. He learned how to play from an elderly man who lived down the road, who died before Carroll moved. He had been quoted as saying, however, that he did not become serious until a year later when he moved from [[Huntington Beach, California]] to [[Claremont, California|Claremont]]. His playing began improving by taking private lessons from various teachers at a local music store. His early teachers included Max McGuire, Johnny Fortune, Mark Hammond, Pebber Brown, [[Joey Tafolla]] and [[Paul Gilbert]]. Buckethead played a tribute to all his early teachers when the Deli Creeps played a show at Styles Music's 25th anniversary. He then began making demo recordings of both his playing as well as his writing styles, which would later be released in 2007\u20132008.\n\nThe Buckethead persona came to be when Carroll saw the 1988 [[horror movie]] ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers|Halloween 4]]'' and was inspired by the film. He went out right after seeing it and bought a Michael Myers-like white mask.

Though available only as a pricey import, the record received positive reviews and earned some attention. At about this time, Buckethead fell into the orbit of prolific bassist/producer [[Bill Laswell]], himself an occasional Zorn collaborator; Buckethead (as a performer, producer, or composer) was introduced to Laswell with the help of Limbomaniacs drummer [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan \"Brain\" Mantia]], who gave Laswell a video of Buckethead playing in his room.<ref>[http://www.tedkurland.com/pbuild/linkbuilder.cfm?selection=doc.271] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215182308/http://www.tedkurland.com/pbuild/linkbuilder.cfm?selection=doc.271 |date=December 15, 2006 }}</ref> Buckethead soon became Laswell's second staple guitar player, besides [[Nicky Skopelitis]].\n\nIn 1992, Buckethead, with Bill Laswell, [[Bernie Worrell]], [[Bootsy Collins]], and [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan \"Brain\" Mantia]], formed the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]].

The final track, \"Nottingham Lace,\" was first made public via his home page and soon became a concert staple and one of his most popular songs. Buckethead also released two further solo albums in 2005, ''[[Kaleidoscalp]]'' and ''Inbred Mountain''\u2014the latter being the first album as a solo artist released on the label TDRS Music. Both albums originally were sold exclusively at concerts and only later got an official release through the label's website.\n\nBuckethead released albums with other bands that year: with [[Cornbugs]], he released two compilation albums, called ''[[Rest Home for Robots]]'' and ''Skeleton Farm''. Gorgone's ''self titled album'' was released that year' itself based upon recording sessions from the album ''[[Population Override]]'' that Buckethead released in 2004.\n\n{{Listen\n |filename     = Buckethead - Jordan (GH2 Version).ogg\n |title        = Excerpt of \"Jordan\"\n |description  = First two bars of \"Jordan\"\n |header = Main guitar riff of \"Jordan\"\n}}\n\nIn 2006 the cross-console video game ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'' was launched, featuring Buckethead's song \"[[Jordan (Buckethead composition)|Jordan]]\" as an unlockable bonus track. Although the song has been performed live in the past, the video game version is the only known studio recording of the song.

The DVD also contains three complete [[Deli Creeps]] shows, a sound check, backstage footage, and solo footage of just Buckethead. He also released the albums ''The Elephant Man's Alarm Clock'' and ''[[Crime Slunk Scene]]'', both sold on his tours but later sold on the TDRS Music website. The last album has the song \"Soothsayer (Dedicated to Aunt Suzie)\"; this song (along with \"Jordan\" and \"Nottingham Lace\") is one of his most popular songs and is often played live. Buckethead released his final compilation album with the band [[Cornbugs]], called ''Celebrity Psychos''. He also released an album with [[Travis Dickerson]], called ''Chicken Noodles'', a move that would see the start of a four-year long collaboration with the keyboardist.

In February, a box set titled ''[[In Search of The]]'', containing 13 albums of original material, was released. It was handcrafted, numbered, and monogrammed by Buckethead and contained over nine hours of music. A regular solo album, called ''Pepper's Ghost'', was released in March. A disc of acoustic improvisations called ''[[Acoustic Shards]]'' was also released, becoming the twentieth studio album that the artist had released so far in his solo career. In midyear, he reissued his demo tape ''Bucketheadland Blueprints'', with two alternative album covers: a special edition with a hand-drawn cover made by him, or a standard edition with the original cover art. In October, he released his final two albums of the year, called  ''Decoding the Tomb of Bansheebot'' and ''Cyborg Slunks''. The latter again came in both a hand-drawn limited edition and (some weeks later) as a normal CD. Buckethead wrote three songs dedicated to Aunt Suzie in 2006-07: the aforementioned \u201cSoothsayer\u201d (Crime Slunk Scene), \u201cAunt Suzie\u201d (Cyborg Slunks), and \u201cSail On Soothsayer\u201d, (Decoding The Tomb Of Bansheebot).\n\nAs ''Death Cube K'', Buckethead released two albums in 2007: an album called DCK, limited to 400 hand-numbered copies and released in August; and in December, the 5-CD box set ''Monolith'', which consisted of one unbroken track per CD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://travisdickersonmusic.com/store/monolith.html |title=Monolith |publisher=Travisdickersonmusic.com |accessdate=2012-02-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206184107/http://travisdickersonmusic.com/store/monolith.html |archivedate=February 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring 2007, Buckethead also collaborated and appeared on numerous albums with other artists.

Their first album, called ''[[Living on Another Frequency]]'', was delayed several times and was finally released in November 2008.\n[[File:Wakarusa 2008.jpg|thumbnail|right|Buckethead live at [[Wakarusa Music and Camping Festival|Wakarusa]], 2008]]\nOn January 1, 2008, the band [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]] released the long-awaited album ''[[Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness)]]'' in Japan. The album had actually been recorded in 2005, but had to be put on hold when the original label went bankrupt. That year Buckethead released ''[[From the Coop]]'' through the label Avabella (where he released ''Acoustic Shards''), consisting of the demos Buckethead gave to Jas Obrecht back in 1988. This CD also included the first ever \"official\" biography of/by the artist. Later that same year, he announced the release of the album called ''Albino Slug'' (a tour-only CD until official release on December of the same year). Along with this album, he appeared on the album ''The Dragons of Eden'', with Dickerson and Mantia, and in collaboration with [[That 1 Guy]] as the ''Frankenstein Brothers'', an album called ''[[Bolt on Neck]]'' was released. [[That 1 Guy]] and Buckethead toured together through fall 2008, playing songs from this album.\n\nBuckethead also appeared in the [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[American Music: Off the Record]]'', in which he appears only playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0887710/ |title=American Music: Off the Record (2008) |publisher=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-29}}</ref> [[Serj Tankian]]'s label, [[Serjical Strike]], reissued the album ''[[Enter the Chicken]]'' with an extra song.

Other influences include martial artist and actor [[Bruce Lee]] (on \"The Game of Death\" song and inspiration behind the use of nunchakus on stage), author [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (on the \"Lurker at the Threshold\" suite), numerous [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] TV shows and movies including ''[[Little House on the Prairie]]'', [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s ''[[The Holy Mountain (1973 film)|The Holy Mountain]]'' (on [[Kaleidoscalp]]), and ''[[Giant Robo (tokusatsu)|Giant Robo]]t'' (mentioned on several songs, albums, and episodes shown on stage).<ref name=\"Buckethead FAQ\" /> [[Disney]] and [[Disneyland]] are also major influences on Buckethead's career.<ref name=\"Buckknows\" /> Buckethead is also inspired by Japanese filmmaker [[Takashi Miike]], to whom a song on Pepper's Ghost is dedicated. ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' franchise of movies is also a big inspiration to him and he has written many songs such as Jowls, which are heavily inspired by those movies. The song \"To Infinity and Beyond\" from ''Out Orbit'' was dedicated to then-recently deceased basketball reporter [[Craig
