They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?

They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?

{"title_page": "List of state and territorial universities in the United States", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2013}}\n<span class=\"plainlinks\"></span>\nIn the [[United States]], a '''state college''' or '''state university''' is one of the [[Public university|public]] [[List of colleges and universities|colleges or universities]] funded by or associated with the [[State governments of the United States|state government]]. In some cases, these institutions of [[higher education|higher learning]] are part of a [[state university]] system, while in other cases they are not. Several [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] also administer public colleges and universities.\n\nAlthough most of these institutions are associated with state governments, a small number of public institutions are directly funded and governed by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], including the [[United States Service academies|service academies]], the [[Community College of the Air Force]], the [[Naval Postgraduate School]], the [[Air Force Institute of Technology]], the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]], military [[War College (disambiguation)|war college]]s and [[staff college]]s, and [[Haskell Indian Nations University]]. A few universities - [[Georgetown University]], [[Gallaudet University]], [[Howard University]], and [[American University]] - are private universities in the District of Columbia that are federally chartered by the United States Government. \n\nThese state, as well as private, universities are accredited by different regional, not national, accreditation agencies, including the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]], the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]], the [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]], the [[Higher Learning Commission]], the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], and the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]], depending on which region of the United States the university is located in. These accreditation agencies' approvals are critical to a university's operations and public reputation. If a university loses accreditation or is not accredited in the first place, students will be reluctant to either continue or enroll at the school because the degree will be seen as being worthless. In a worst-case scenario, a university can shut down completely. The aforementioned agencies are all recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]].\n\nMost state universities receive at least part of their funding from the state, although many have substantial income from [[tuition]] and fees, [[Financial endowment|endowment]] proceeds, donations (such as from alumni or philanthropists), and revenue from [[royalties]]. State universities usually offer lower tuition costs to in-state residents. According to the [[College Board]], public four-year colleges charge on average $7,605 per year in tuition and fees for full-time in-state students and $11,990 for out-of-state students.<ref>[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/pay/add-it-up/4494.html]</ref> Substantial financial support is also provided by the federal government, particularly through federal [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]].\n\nIn some states, e.g. [[Maryland]], [[Tennessee]], [[Indiana]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], there is a campus designated as the \"flagship\" campus in the state's university system, which generally is the most prestigious campus and the largest campus in student population, e.g. the [[University of Maryland College Park]] campus in the [[University System of Maryland]], the [[Indiana University Bloomington]] campus in the [[Indiana University (system)|Indiana University System]], the [[University of Tennessee Knoxville]] campus in the [[University of Tennessee System]], and the [[University of Washington]]'s Seattle campus in the University of Washington System.\n\nHowever, in some other states, the state universities are treated as equal partners; therefore there is no officially recognized flagship campus in the state's university system.<ref>[http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2012/02/29/krichert/a_single_outdated_word_board_president_addresses_u_i_flagship_fl Idaho] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411025340/http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2012/02/29/krichert/a_single_outdated_word_board_president_addresses_u_i_flagship_fl |date=2013-04-11 }}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of states that have more than one university system, e.g. [[California]] with 2; [[Colorado]] with 2; [[Indiana]] with 2; [[New York (state)|New York]] with 2; [[Tennessee]] with 2; and [[Texas]] with 6 (the most).\n{{Education in the U.S.}}\n'''Notes:'''\n*As a general rule, schools are not alphabetized by their complete names, but rather by the names by which they are normally called. For example, in a list alphabetized by normal rules, \"Auburn University\" would precede \"University of Alabama,\" but the schools are virtually always referred to in popular conversation as \"Auburn\" and \"Alabama\" (followed by a campus identifier if required by the context). Therefore, in this article, \"Alabama\" precedes \"Auburn\".\n*The list includes some of the more common academic nicknames or acronyms used for certain colleges or universities, e.g. \"Ole Miss\" for the University of Mississippi, \"Idaho State\" for Idaho State University, or \"UNF\" for the University of North Florida, not the \"Rebels\", \"Bengals\", or \"Ospreys\", respectively. \n**To minimize any confusion regarding acronyms, either the first school listed or the school that is more nationally known having an acronym the same as another has the acronym provided, e.g. San Diego State University has the acronym \"SDSU\" included because it is listed before South Dakota State University, and Arizona State University has the acronym \"ASU\" given because it is better known nationally than Alabama State. In addition, only acronyms that are unique are given, e.g. \"UW Tacoma\" for the University of Washington's Tacoma campus or \"UNH\" for the University of New Hampshire. \n*The list also includes schools that grant first-professional doctorates only (e.g., [[medical school]]s, [[law school]]s, or [[Schools of veterinary medicine|veterinary schools]]) that are independent of any other school in a state system.\n*Satellite campuses that do not have accreditation separate from the mother institution are not included in the list, e.g. [[University of Washington Tacoma]] remains an integral part of the [[University of Washington]], which is based in Seattle. On the other hand, institutions like [[University of Houston\u2013Downtown]] and [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] are provided separate entries as they are considered independent, autonomous institutions. \n*To see a list of community colleges and technical centers in the United States that offer only [[associate's degrees]], visit the [[List of community colleges|community colleges list]].\n*To see a list of tribal colleges and universities in the United States, visit the [[List of tribal colleges and universities|tribal colleges and universities list]].\n*Non-[[bachelor's degree]]-granting institutions, such as [[graduate school]]s, are listed in ''italics''.\n\n<!---This list is for public 4 year regionally accredited state universities only, not for private or for-profit schools nor for community colleges. Technical institutions are to be listed here only if they either have 4 year degree programs or ''are'' 4 year colleges. Also, satellite campuses that do not have separate regional accreditation from the mother institution should NOT be included in the list. Tribal colleges and universities are on their own page due to the fact that tribal institutions are controlled and operated by various American Indian tribes (who have dual sovereignty in the United States), not states.!--->\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Alabama==\n*[[Alabama A&M University]] (Alabama A&M)\n*[[Alabama State University]] (Alabama State)\n*[[Athens State University]]\n*Auburn University system\n**[[Auburn University]] (Auburn) ([[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[Auburn University at Montgomery]]\n*[[Jacksonville State University]]\n*[[Troy University]]\n*[[University of Alabama System]]\n**[[University of Alabama]] (Alabama) ([[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] (UAB)\n**[[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH)\n*[[University of Montevallo]]\n*[[University of North Alabama]] (UNA)\n*[[University of South Alabama]] (USA)\n*[[University of West Alabama]] (UWA)\n\n==Alaska==\n*[[University of Alaska System]]\n**[[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] (UAF) ([[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Alaska Anchorage]] (UAA)\n**[[University of Alaska Southeast]] (UAS)\n\n==Arizona==\n\n* [[Arizona Board of Regents]]\n**[[Arizona State University]] (ASU)\n**[[Northern Arizona University]] (NAU)\n**[[University of Arizona]]\n\n==Arkansas==\n*[[University of Arkansas System]]\n**[[University of Arkansas]] (Arkansas) ([[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Arkansas\u2013Fort Smith]]\n**[[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]]\n**''[[University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences]]''\n**[[University of Arkansas at Monticello]]\n**[[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]]\n*[[Arkansas State University System]]\n**[[Arkansas State University]]\n*[[Arkansas Tech University]]\n*[[University of Central Arkansas]] (UCA, Central Arkansas)\n*[[Henderson State University]]\n*[[Southern Arkansas University]] (SAU)\n\n==California==\n*[[University of California]] system\n**[[University of California, Berkeley]] (UC Berkeley) \n**[[University of California, Davis]] (UC Davis)\n**[[University of California, Irvine]] (UC Irvine)\n**[[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA)\n**[[University of California, Merced]] (UC Merced)\n**[[University of California, Riverside]] (UC Riverside)\n**[[University of California, San Diego]] (UC San Diego)\n**''[[University of California, San Francisco]]''  (UCSF)\n**[[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB)\n**[[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (UC Santa Cruz)\n**''[[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]]'' (law school;

In some cases, these institutions of [[higher education|higher learning]] are part of a [[state university]] system, while in other cases they are not. Several [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] also administer public colleges and universities.\n\nAlthough most of these institutions are associated with state governments, a small number of public institutions are directly funded and governed by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], including the [[United States Service academies|service academies]], the [[Community College of the Air Force]], the [[Naval Postgraduate School]], the [[Air Force Institute of Technology]], the [[Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences]], military [[War College (disambiguation)|war college]]s and [[staff college]]s, and [[Haskell Indian Nations University]]. A few universities - [[Georgetown University]], [[Gallaudet University]], [[Howard University]], and [[American University]] - are private universities in the District of Columbia that are federally chartered by the United States Government. \n\nThese state, as well as private, universities are accredited by different regional, not national, accreditation agencies, including the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]], the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]], the [[Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities]], the [[Higher Learning Commission]], the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], and the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]], depending on which region of the United States the university is located in. These accreditation agencies' approvals are critical to a university's operations and public reputation. If a university loses accreditation or is not accredited in the first place, students will be reluctant to either continue or enroll at the school because the degree will be seen as being worthless. In a worst-case scenario, a university can shut down completely. The aforementioned agencies are all recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]].\n\nMost state universities receive at least part of their funding from the state, although many have substantial income from [[tuition]] and fees, [[Financial endowment|endowment]] proceeds, donations (such as from alumni or philanthropists), and revenue from [[royalties]]. State universities usually offer lower tuition costs to in-state residents. According to the [[College Board]], public four-year colleges charge on average $7,605 per year in tuition and fees for full-time in-state students and $11,990 for out-of-state students.<ref>[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/pay/add-it-up/4494.html]</ref> Substantial financial support is also provided by the federal government, particularly through federal [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]].\n\nIn some states, e.g. [[Maryland]], [[Tennessee]], [[Indiana]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], there is a campus designated as the \"flagship\" campus in the state's university system, which generally is the most prestigious campus and the largest campus in student population, e.g. the [[University of Maryland College Park]] campus in the [[University System of Maryland]], the [[Indiana University Bloomington]] campus in the [[Indiana University (system)|Indiana University System]], the [[University of Tennessee Knoxville]] campus in the [[University of Tennessee System]], and the [[University of Washington]]'s Seattle campus in the University of Washington System.\n\nHowever, in some other states, the state universities are treated as equal partners; therefore there is no officially recognized flagship campus in the state's university system.<ref>[http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2012/02/29/krichert/a_single_outdated_word_board_president_addresses_u_i_flagship_fl Idaho] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130411025340/http://voices.idahostatesman.com/2012/02/29/krichert/a_single_outdated_word_board_president_addresses_u_i_flagship_fl |date=2013-04-11 }}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of states that have more than one university system, e.g. [[California]] with 2; [[Colorado]] with 2; [[Indiana]] with 2; [[New York (state)|New York]] with 2; [[Tennessee]] with 2; and [[Texas]] with 6 (the most).\n{{Education in the U.S.}}\n'''Notes:'''\n*As a general rule, schools are not alphabetized by their complete names, but rather by the names by which they are normally called. For example, in a list alphabetized by normal rules, \"Auburn University\" would precede \"University of Alabama,\" but the schools are virtually always referred to in popular conversation as \"Auburn\" and \"Alabama\" (followed by a campus identifier if required by the context). Therefore, in this article, \"Alabama\" precedes \"Auburn\".\n*The list includes some of the more common academic nicknames or acronyms used for certain colleges or universities, e.g. \"Ole Miss\" for the University of Mississippi, \"Idaho State\" for Idaho State University, or \"UNF\" for the University of North Florida, not the \"Rebels\", \"Bengals\", or \"Ospreys\", respectively. \n**To minimize any confusion regarding acronyms, either the first school listed or the school that is more nationally known having an acronym the same as another has the acronym provided, e.g. San Diego State University has the acronym \"SDSU\" included because it is listed before South Dakota State University, and Arizona State University has the acronym \"ASU\" given because it is better known nationally than Alabama State. In addition, only acronyms that are unique are given, e.g. \"UW Tacoma\" for the University of Washington's Tacoma campus or \"UNH\" for the University of New Hampshire. \n*The list also includes schools that grant first-professional doctorates only (e.g., [[medical school]]s, [[law school]]s, or [[Schools of veterinary medicine|veterinary schools]]) that are independent of any other school in a state system.\n*Satellite campuses that do not have accreditation separate from the mother institution are not included in the list, e.g. [[University of Washington Tacoma]] remains an integral part of the [[University of Washington]], which is based in Seattle. On the other hand, institutions like [[University of Houston\u2013Downtown]] and [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] are provided separate entries as they are considered independent, autonomous institutions. \n*To see a list of community colleges and technical centers in the United States that offer only [[associate's degrees]], visit the [[List of community colleges|community colleges list]].\n*To see a list of tribal colleges and universities in the United States, visit the [[List of tribal colleges and universities|tribal colleges and universities list]].\n*Non-[[bachelor's degree]]-granting institutions, such as [[graduate school]]s, are listed in ''italics''.\n\n<!---This list is for public 4 year regionally accredited state universities only, not for private or for-profit schools nor for community colleges. Technical institutions are to be listed here only if they either have 4 year degree programs or ''are'' 4 year colleges. Also, satellite campuses that do not have separate regional accreditation from the mother institution should NOT be included in the list. Tribal colleges and universities are on their own page due to the fact that tribal institutions are controlled and operated by various American Indian tribes (who have dual sovereignty in the United States), not states.!--->\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Alabama==\n*[[Alabama A&M University]] (Alabama A&M)\n*[[Alabama State University]] (Alabama State)\n*[[Athens State University]]\n*Auburn University system\n**[[Auburn University]] (Auburn) ([[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[Auburn University at Montgomery]]\n*[[Jacksonville State University]]\n*[[Troy University]]\n*[[University of Alabama System]]\n**[[University of Alabama]] (Alabama) ([[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] (UAB)\n**[[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH)\n*[[University of Montevallo]]\n*[[University of North Alabama]] (UNA)\n*[[University of South Alabama]] (USA)\n*[[University of West Alabama]] (UWA)\n\n==Alaska==\n*[[University of Alaska System]]\n**[[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] (UAF) ([[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Alaska Anchorage]] (UAA)\n**[[University of Alaska Southeast]] (UAS)\n\n==Arizona==\n\n* [[Arizona Board of Regents]]\n**[[Arizona State University]] (ASU)\n**[[Northern Arizona University]] (NAU)\n**[[University of Arizona]]\n\n==Arkansas==\n*[[University of Arkansas System]]\n**[[University of Arkansas]] (Arkansas) ([[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]] \u2013 flagship/main campus)\n**[[University of Arkansas\u2013Fort Smith]]\n**[[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]]\n**''[[University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences]]''\n**[[University of Arkansas at Monticello]]\n**[[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]]\n*[[Arkansas State University System]]\n**[[Arkansas State University]]\n*[[Arkansas Tech University]]\n*[[University of Central Arkansas]] (UCA, Central Arkansas)\n*[[Henderson State University]]\n*[[Southern Arkansas University]] (SAU)\n\n==California==\n*[[University of California]] system\n**[[University of California, Berkeley]] (UC Berkeley) \n**[[University of California, Davis]] (UC Davis)\n**[[University of California, Irvine]] (UC Irvine)\n**[[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA)\n**[[University of California, Merced]] (UC Merced)\n**[[University of California, Riverside]] (UC Riverside)\n**[[University of California, San Diego]] (UC San Diego)\n**''[[University of California, San Francisco]]''  (UCSF)\n**[[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB)\n**[[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (UC Santa Cruz)\n**''[[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]]'' (law school;

Based on \"''when you drink water, think of its source, to not forget one's roots or heritage''\" ({{linktext|\u98f2\u6c34\u601d\u6e90}}) traditional chinese [[proverb]], on 1 May 2004, the Ma Chung College was established as the initial step in the establishment of Ma Chung University, which was founded by [[Mochtar Riady]], a [[Chinese-Indonesian]] billionaire, and other fourteen notable Ma Chung High School alumni (Soegeng Hendarto, Teguh Kinarto, Hendro Sunjoto, Koentjoro Loekito, Effendy Sudargo, Agus Chandra, Hadi Widjojo, Nuryati Tanuwidjaya, Nehemja, Alex Lesmana Samudra, Evelyn Adam, Usman Harsono, Nagawidjaja Winoto, and Soebroto Wirotomo):<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.machung.ac.id/tentang-pendiri|title=Founders of Ma Chung University|last=|first=|date=|website=Universitas Ma Chung|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the Grand Reunion in commemoration of the 60th Anniversary of Ma Chung High School in Malang, 17 July 2005, laid the first stone in the construction of Ma Chung University and the Harapan Bangsa Sejahtera Foundation was formed which houses Ma Chung University.

Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support.\n[[File:WGEliot.jpg|203x203px|left|thumb|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees]]\n\nDuring the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names. The board first approved \"Eliot Seminary,\" but William Eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary, which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith.

During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the university amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S.

Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the university, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|195x195px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the university began to move west. The university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]].

The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson's original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.<ref name=\"Architecture of Danforth Campus\" />\nBy 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louis's Central West End.

It is the location of all the freshman buildings as well as several sophomore buildings, which are set up in the traditional [[residential college]] system. All of the residential halls are co-ed. The dormitories on the South 40 have grown national recognition for their large size and large number of amenities.<ref name=\":1\" /> The South 40 is organized as a pedestrian-friendly environment wherein residences surround a central recreational lawn known as the Swamp. Bear's Den (the largest dining hall on campus), the Habif Health and Wellness Center (Student Health Services), the Residential Life Office, [[University police]] Headquarters, various student-owned businesses (e.g. the laundry service, Wash U Wash), and the baseball, softball, and intramural fields are also located on the South 40.\n\nAnother group of residences, known as the Village, is located in the northwest corner of [[Danforth Campus]]. Only open to upperclassmen and January Scholars, the North Side consists of Millbrook Apartments, The Village, Village East on-campus apartments, and all fraternity houses except the Zeta Beta Tau house, which is off campus and located just northwest of the South 40. Sororities at Washington University do not have houses by their own accord. The Village is a group of residences where students who have similar interests or academic goals apply as small groups of 4 to 24, known as BLOCs, to live together in clustered suites along with non-BLOCs. Like the South 40, the residences around the Village also surround a recreational lawn.\n\nIn addition to South 40 and North Side residence halls, Washington University owns several apartment buildings within walking distance to Danforth Campus, which are open to upperclassmen.\n\n===Student media===\nWashington University supports four major student-run media outlets. The university's [[student newspaper]], [[Student Life (newspaper)|''Student Life'']], is available for students. [[KWUR]] (90.3 FM) serves as the students' official radio station; the station also attracts an audience in the immediately surrounding community due to its eclectic and free-form musical programming. WUTV is the university's [[closed-circuit television|closed-circuit]] [[television channel]]. The university's main student-run political publication is the Washington University Political Review (nicknamed \"WUPR\"), a self-described \"multipartisan\" monthly magazine. Washington University undergraduates publish two literary and art journals, The Eliot Review and Spires Intercollegiate Arts and Literary Magazine. A variety of other publications also serve the university community, ranging from in-house [[academic journal]]s to glossy alumni magazines to ''WUnderground'', the student-run satirical newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.wustl.edu/|title=WUnderground \u2013 WashU's Premier (and only) satirical newspaper!|website=Wunderground.wustl.edu|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505144307/http://www.wunderground.wustl.edu/|archive-date=May 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Athletics===\n{{Main|Washington University Bears}}\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|266x266px|[[Francis Olympic Field]] during the [[1904 St. Louis Olympics]]|alt=|left]]\nWashington University's sports teams are called the Bears.

Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support.\n[[File:WGEliot.jpg|203x203px|left|thumb|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees]]\n\nDuring the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names. The board first approved \"Eliot Seminary,\" but William Eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary, which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith. He favored a nonsectarian university.<ref name=founding>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |title=The Founding of Washington University |accessdate=January 8, 2009 |work=Washington University in St. Louis Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725130512/http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> In 1854, the Board of Trustees changed the name to \"Washington Institute\" in honor of [[George Washington]], and because the charter was coincidentally passed on Washington\u2019s birthday, February 22.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.wustl.edu/wustl-faq/washington|title=Research Guides: WU History FAQ: Origin of Washington University's Name|last=Rectenwald|first=Miranda|website=libguides.wustl.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Naming the university after the nation's first president, only seven years before the [[American Civil War]] and during a time of bitter national division, was no coincidence. During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the university amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S.

Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the university, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|195x195px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the university began to move west. The university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]. The elevation of the land was thought to resemble the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and inspired the nickname of \"Hilltop\" campus, renamed the Danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor [[William Henry Danforth|William H.

The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson's original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.<ref name=\"Architecture of Danforth Campus\" />\nBy 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louis's Central West End.

It is the location of all the freshman buildings as well as several sophomore buildings, which are set up in the traditional [[residential college]] system. All of the residential halls are co-ed. The dormitories on the South 40 have grown national recognition for their large size and large number of amenities.<ref name=\":1\" /> The South 40 is organized as a pedestrian-friendly environment wherein residences surround a central recreational lawn known as the Swamp. Bear's Den (the largest dining hall on campus), the Habif Health and Wellness Center (Student Health Services), the Residential Life Office, [[University police]] Headquarters, various student-owned businesses (e.g. the laundry service, Wash U Wash), and the baseball, softball, and intramural fields are also located on the South 40.\n\nAnother group of residences, known as the Village, is located in the northwest corner of [[Danforth Campus]]. Only open to upperclassmen and January Scholars, the North Side consists of Millbrook Apartments, The Village, Village East on-campus apartments, and all fraternity houses except the Zeta Beta Tau house, which is off campus and located just northwest of the South 40. Sororities at Washington University do not have houses by their own accord. The Village is a group of residences where students who have similar interests or academic goals apply as small groups of 4 to 24, known as BLOCs, to live together in clustered suites along with non-BLOCs. Like the South 40, the residences around the Village also surround a recreational lawn.\n\nIn addition to South 40 and North Side residence halls, Washington University owns several apartment buildings within walking distance to Danforth Campus, which are open to upperclassmen.\n\n===Student media===\nWashington University supports four major student-run media outlets. The university's [[student newspaper]], [[Student Life (newspaper)|''Student Life'']], is available for students. [[KWUR]] (90.3 FM) serves as the students' official radio station; the station also attracts an audience in the immediately surrounding community due to its eclectic and free-form musical programming. WUTV is the university's [[closed-circuit television|closed-circuit]] [[television channel]]. The university's main student-run political publication is the Washington University Political Review (nicknamed \"WUPR\"), a self-described \"multipartisan\" monthly magazine. Washington University undergraduates publish two literary and art journals, The Eliot Review and Spires Intercollegiate Arts and Literary Magazine. A variety of other publications also serve the university community, ranging from in-house [[academic journal]]s to glossy alumni magazines to ''WUnderground'', the student-run satirical newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.wustl.edu/|title=WUnderground \u2013 WashU's Premier (and only) satirical newspaper!|website=Wunderground.wustl.edu|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505144307/http://www.wunderground.wustl.edu/|archive-date=May 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Athletics===\n{{Main|Washington University Bears}}\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|266x266px|[[Francis Olympic Field]] during the [[1904 St. Louis Olympics]]|alt=|left]]\nWashington University's sports teams are called the Bears.

As needs have arisen, MF has developed a broad portfolio of professional degrees for church and school. The religious demography of Norway has changed significantly. There is an increasing need and demand for knowledge and quality in research on, education in and communication about religion and society. MF meets this challenge through interdisciplinary research on religion and society, along with relevant bachelor, master and ph.d. degrees in theology, religion and society.\n\n'''MF has two centers:'''\n\n''MF KOM \u2013 Center for Excellence in Research, Development and Communication for Church and Congregation''.

The Chair of [[Systematic Theology]] was vacant after the death of [[Fredrik Petersen (theologian)|Fredrik Petersen]] in 1903, and in 1906 the liberal theologian [[Johannes Ording]] was appointed to the Chair. Ording was appointed after a lengthy debate which almost led to a crisis in the Government of Norway. It was not supported by the other leading professors at the faculty, and [[Sigurd Odland]] at the Faculty of Theology and the Minister of Church Affairs [[Christopher Knudsen]] in the Government left their positions following the appointment.\n<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://snl.no/Johannes_Ording\n| title      = Johannes Ording\n| publisher  = Store norske leksikon\n| author     = Hallgeir Elstad\n| accessdate = March 1, 2017\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://snl.no/Fredrik_Petersen_-_norsk_teolog\n| title      = Fredrik Petersen \u2013 norsk teolog\n| publisher  = Store norske leksikon\n| author     = Hallgeir Elstad\n| accessdate = March 1, 2017\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://snl.no/Sigurd_Vilhelm_Odland\n| title      = Sigurd Vilhelm Odland\n| publisher  = Store norske leksikon\n| author     = Hallgeir Elstad\n| accessdate = March 1, 2017\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://snl.no/Christoffer_Knudsen\n| title      = Christoffer Knudsen\n| publisher  = Store norske leksikon\n| author     = Knut D\u00f8rum\n| accessdate = March 1, 2017\n}}</ref>\n\nNotable people in the society and the Church gathering around Odland then took steps to found an independent institution training the clergy. The founding charter was signed October 16, 1907, and the School was opened in the autumn of 1908 with only 8 students (a number that increased to 14 before the end of the first term).

As needs have arisen, MF has developed a broad portfolio of professional degrees for church and school. The religious demography of Norway has changed significantly. There is an increasing need and demand for knowledge and quality in research on, education in and communication about religion and society. MF meets this challenge through interdisciplinary research on religion and society, along with relevant bachelor, master and ph.d. degrees in theology, religion and society.\n\n\n'''MF has two centers:'''\n\n''MF KOM \u2013 Center for Excellence in Research, Development and Communication for Church and Congregation''. This center is an intermediary between scholars at MF and church workers who wish to utilize MF's competency in their own contexts.\n\n''MF Center for the Advanced Study of Religion, MF CASR'', organizes the research on religion done at MF. It facilitates joint projects between MF and other institutions. MF CASR encompasses areas of research including religious studies, history of religion, philosophy of religion, texts and manuscript research, cultural and art history, along with sociology of religion.\n\n\n''Norwegian Philological Institute'' (PHI) is affiliated with and located at MF. The cooperation involves offering courses in classical languages connected with major world religions and cultures.  \n\n\nMF's areas of activity are education, research and communication.\n\nBeginning as a confessional school, today it is an ecumenical inclusive school offering education specific to a number of denominations ([[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]], [[Catholic]], [[Salvation Army]] and [[Pentecostal]]).<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.mf.no/om-mf\n| title      = Presentasjon av Det teologiske menighetsfakultet\n| publisher  = Det teologiske menighetsfakultet\n| accessdate = March 1, 2017\n}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Menighetsfakultetet.jpg|thumb|left|Campus]]\nMF was founded in 1907 by a body of people (Norwegian academics, politicians, clergy and lay people) wanting to build the education and research on the [[Holy Scriptures]] and the [[Lutheran Confessions]].\n\nThe main reason for the establishing of the School was an appointment to a professoriate at the Faculty of Theology at [[University of Oslo]]. The Chair of [[Systematic Theology]] was vacant after the death of [[Fredrik Petersen (theologian)|Fredrik Petersen]] in 1903, and in 1906 the liberal theologian [[Johannes Ording]] was appointed to the Chair. Ording was appointed after a lengthy debate which almost led to a crisis in the Government of Norway. It was not supported by the other leading professors at the faculty, and [[Sigurd Odland]] at the Faculty of Theology and the Minister of Church Affairs [[Christopher Knudsen]] in the Government left their positions following the appointment.\n<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://snl.no/Johannes_Ording\n| title      = Johannes Ording\n| publisher  = Store norske leksikon\n| author     = Hallgeir Elstad\n| accessdate = March 1, 2017\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://snl.no/Fredrik_Petersen_-_norsk_teolog\n| title      = Fredrik Petersen \u2013 norsk teolog\n| publisher  = Store norske leksikon\n| author     = Hallgeir Elstad\n| accessdate = March 1, 2017\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://snl.no/Sigurd_Vilhelm_Odland\n| title      = Sigurd Vilhelm Odland\n| publisher  = Store norske leksikon\n| author     = Hallgeir Elstad\n| accessdate = March 1, 2017\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://snl.no/Christoffer_Knudsen\n| title      = Christoffer Knudsen\n| publisher  = Store norske leksikon\n| author     = Knut D\u00f8rum\n| accessdate = March 1, 2017\n}}</ref>\n\nNotable people in the society and the Church gathering around Odland then took steps to found an independent institution training the clergy. The founding charter was signed October 16, 1907, and the School was opened in the autumn of 1908 with only 8 students (a number that increased to 14 before the end of the first term). The earliest teachers were [[Sigurd Odland]] ([[New Testament]]), [[Edvard Sverdrup]] ([[Church history]]), [[Peter Hognestad]] ([[Old Testament]]), [[Ole Hallesby]] ([[Systematic theology]]). From 1919 the members of academic staff was granted the right to call themselves professors.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://snl.no/Edvard_Sverdrup\n| title      = Edvard Sverdrup\n| publisher  = Store norske leksikon\n| author     = Hallgeir Elstad\n| accessdate = March 1, 2017\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://snl.no/Peter_Hansson_Hognestad\n| title      = Peter Hansson Hognestad\n| publisher  = Store norske leksikon\n| author     = Hallgeir Elstad\n| accessdate = March 1, 2017\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://snl.no/Ole_Hallesby\n| title      = Ole Hallesby\n| publisher  = Store norske leksikon\n| author     = Hallgeir Elstad\n| accessdate = March 1, 2017\n}}</ref>\n\nThe school grew steadily, and in 1913 MF was given the right to offer degrees in [[Theology]], and also in [[Practical Theology]] from 1925.
