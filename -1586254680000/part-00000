For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its [[molecules]] may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid-crystal [[Phase (matter)|phases]], which can be distinguished by their different [[Optics|optical]] properties (such as [[Texture (crystalline)|textures]]). The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal state of matter (just as water may turn into ice or water vapor).\n\nLiquid crystals can be divided into [[thermotropic]], [[lyotropic]] and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of [[organic molecules]], although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a [[phase transition]] into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and [[concentration]] of the liquid-crystal molecules in a [[solvent]] (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.\n\nExamples of liquid crystals can be found both in the natural world and in technological applications. Widespread [[Liquid-crystal display]]s use liquid crystals. Lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems but can also be found in the mineral world. For example, many proteins and cell membranes are liquid crystals. Other well-known examples of liquid crystals are solutions of [[soap]] and various related [[detergent]]s, as well as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]], and some [[clays]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1888, Austrian botanical physiologist [[Friedrich Reinitzer]], working at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universit\u00e4t]], examined the physico-chemical properties of various [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of [[cholesterol]] which now belong to the class of materials known as cholesteric liquid crystals. Previously, other researchers had observed distinct color effects when cooling cholesterol derivatives just above the [[freezing point]], but had not associated it with a new phenomenon. Reinitzer perceived that color changes in a derivative [[cholesteryl benzoate]] were not the most peculiar feature.[[File:Cholesteryl benzoate.png|thumb|250 px|Chemical structure of [[cholesteryl benzoate]] molecule]] He found that cholesteryl benzoate does not [[melting|melt]] in the same manner as other compounds, but has two [[melting point]]s. At {{convert|145.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} it melts into a cloudy liquid, and at {{convert|178.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} it melts again and the cloudy liquid becomes clear. The phenomenon is reversible. Seeking help from a physicist, on March 14, 1888, he wrote to [[Otto Lehmann (physicist)|Otto Lehmann]], at that time a ''{{lang|de|[[Privatdozent]]}}'' in [[Aachen]]. They exchanged letters and samples. Lehmann examined the intermediate cloudy fluid, and reported seeing [[crystallite]]s. Reinitzer's Viennese colleague von Zepharovich also indicated that the intermediate \"fluid\" was crystalline. The exchange of letters with Lehmann ended on April 24, with many questions unanswered. Reinitzer presented his results, with credits to Lehmann and von Zepharovich, at a meeting of the Vienna Chemical Society on May 3, 1888.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss des Cholesterins| journal=Monatshefte f\u00fcr Chemie| volume = 9| issue =1| pages = 421\u2013441|date =1888| doi =10.1007/BF01516710| last1 = Reinitzer| first1 = Friedrich}}</ref>\n\nBy that time, Reinitzer had discovered and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): the existence of two melting points, the reflection of [[circular polarization|circularly polarized light]], and the ability to rotate the polarization direction of light.\n\nAfter his accidental discovery, Reinitzer did not pursue studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who realized that he had encountered a new phenomenon and was in a position to investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the [[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=Lehmann, O. |doi=10.1515/zpch-1889-0434| title = \u00dcber fliessende Krystalle| journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie|volume =4| pages = 462\u201372|date =1889}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Otto Lehmann.jpg|thumb|180px|Otto Lehmann]]\nLehmann's work was continued and significantly expanded by the German chemist [[Daniel Vorl\u00e4nder]], who from the beginning of 20th century until his retirement in 1935, had synthesized most of the liquid crystals known. However, liquid crystals were not popular among scientists and the material remained a pure scientific curiosity for about 80 years.<ref name=b3/>\n\nAfter World War II work on the synthesis of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. [[George William Gray]], a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed a better understanding of how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book ''Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals''<ref>Gray, G. W. (1962) ''Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals'', Academic Press</ref> became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the [[University of Cincinnati]] and later at [[Kent State University]]. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world's top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13583149408628630|title=Professor Horst Sackmann, 1921 \u2013 1993|date=1994|last1=Stegemeyer|first1=H|journal=Liquid Crystals Today|volume=4|pages=1\u20132}}</ref><ref>[http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm Liquid Crystals] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120805230930/http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm |date=August 5, 2012 }}. kfupm.edu.sa</ref>\n\nLiquid crystal materials became a focus of research in the development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at [[RCA]] Laboratories.<ref name=castellano/> When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a [[#Nematic_phase|nematic]] liquid crystal at 125&nbsp;\u00b0C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague [[George H. Heilmeier]] to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the [[para-Azoxyanisole]] that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116&nbsp;\u00b0C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.\n\nIn 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, research chemists in Heilmeier group at RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed only in the number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of [[Schiff base]] compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22\u2013105&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>Goldmacher, Joel E. and Castellano, Joseph A. \"Electro-optical Compositions and Devices,\" {{US Patent|3540796}}, Issue date: November 17, 1970.</ref> Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1652453|title=Dynamic Scattering in Nematic Liquid Crystals|date=1968|last1=Heilmeier|first1=G.

This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide [[operating temperature]] range eventually became the industry standard and is still used to tailor materials to meet specific applications.\n\n[[File:MBBA cleaner.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of [[MBBA|N-(4-Methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline (MBBA)]] molecule]]\nIn 1969, Hans Kelker succeeded in synthesizing a substance that had a nematic phase at room temperature, [[MBBA]], which is one of the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Angew.

Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotic, conic (bowlic), and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a conic LC is not flat, but is shaped like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object).<ref>Lam, Lui (1994). \"Bowlics\".

One can distinguish positional order (whether molecules are arranged in any sort of ordered lattice) and orientational order (whether molecules are mostly pointing in the same direction), and moreover order can be either short-range (only between molecules close to each other) or long-range (extending to larger, sometimes [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]], dimensions). Most thermotropic LCs will have an [[isotropic]] phase at high temperature. That is that heating will eventually drive them into a conventional liquid phase characterized by random and isotropic molecular ordering (little to no long-range order), and [[fluid]]-like flow behavior. Under other conditions (for instance, lower temperature), a LC might inhabit one or more phases with significant  [[anisotropic]] orientational structure and short-range orientational order while still having an ability to flow.<ref name=b2>\n{{cite book|author=Chandrasekhar, S.|title=Liquid Crystals|edition = 2nd|location = Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1992|isbn=978-0-521-41747-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TxvUxFlQsEsC&printsec=frontcover|author-link=Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar}}\n</ref><ref name=b1>\n{{cite book|author=[[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes|de Gennes, P.G.]] and Prost, J|title=The Physics of Liquid Crystals|location = Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|date=1993|isbn=978-0-19-852024-5}}\n</ref>\n\nThe ordering of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends up to the entire domain size, which may be on the order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical [[crystal]]line solids. However some techniques, such as the use of boundaries or an applied [[electric field]], can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The orientational ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one [[dimension]], with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.<ref name=b4>{{cite book|author=Dierking, I. |title=Textures of Liquid Crystals|location=Weinheim|date=2003|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-3-527-30725-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p-0xdzDRB2kC&printsec=frontcover}}</ref><ref name=b5>{{cite book|author1=Collings, P.J.|author2=Hird, M.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Introduction to Liquid Crystals|location=Bristol, PA|publisher=Taylor & Francis|date=1997|isbn=978-0-7484-0643-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoli0000coll}}\n</ref>\n\n===Thermotropic liquid crystals===\n{{see also|Thermotropic crystal}}\nThermotropic phases are those that occur in a certain temperature range.

At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal.<ref name=b2/><ref name=b1/> Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed.

The word ''nematic'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|\u03bd\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1}} (''{{lang-el|nema}}''), which means \"thread\". This term originates from the thread-like [[topological defect]]s observed in nematics, which are formally called '[[disclination]]s'. Nematics also exhibit so-called \"hedgehog\" topological defects. In a nematic phase, the ''calamitic'' or rod-shaped organic molecules have no positional order, but they self-align to have long-range directional order with their long axes roughly parallel.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.csupomona.edu/~jarego/pubs/RD2_LC.pdf |title=Asymmetric synthesis of a highly soluble 'trimeric' analogue of the chiral nematic liquid crystal twist agent Merck S1011 |last=Rego |first=J.A. |last2=Harvey |first2=Jamie A.A. |last3=MacKinnon |first3=Andrew L. |last4=Gatdula |first4=Elysse |journal=Liquid Crystals |volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 2010 |pages=37\u201343 |doi=10.1080/02678290903359291 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008152304/http://www.csupomona.edu/~jarego/pubs/RD2_LC.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Thus, the molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid, but still maintain their long-range directional order.

This phase is often called the [[Cholesteric liquid crystal|''cholesteric'']] phase because it was first observed for [[cholesterol]] derivatives. Only [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral molecules]] can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle with respect to the layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.<ref name=b1/><ref name=b4/><ref name=b5/>\n\n[[File:Cholesterinisch.png|thumb|Chiral nematic phase; p refers to the chiral pitch (see text)]]\nThe ''chiral pitch'', p, refers to the distance over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360\u00b0 twist (but note that the structure of the chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0\u00b0 and \u00b1180\u00b0 are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly.

Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with [[Crystal structure|lattice]] periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective [[Bragg's law|Bragg reflections]] in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the [[Cubic phase|cubic lattice]]. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to [[quasicrystal]]s.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| title = Lattice Textures in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals\n| author=Kleinert H.\n| author-link=Hagen Kleinert\n| author2=Maki K.\n| last-author-amp=yes\n| journal=Fortschritte der Physik\n| volume = 29\n| issue = 5\n| pages = 219\u2013259\n| date = 1981\n| doi = 10.1002/prop.19810290503\n| url = http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/75/75.pdf|bibcode = 1981ForPh..29..219K\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://chemgroups.northwestern.edu/seideman/Publications/The%20liquid-crystalline%20blue%20phases.pdf|title=The liquid-crystalline blue phases|journal=Rep.

Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.\n\nThe content of water or other solvent molecules changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into [[micelle]]s or [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.\n\nThe objects created by amphiphiles are usually spherical (as in the case of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These anisotropic self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves in much the same way as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).\n\nFor some systems, at high concentrations, inverse phases are observed. That is, one may generate an inverse hexagonal columnar phase (columns of water encapsulated by amphiphiles) or an inverse micellar phase (a bulk liquid crystal sample with spherical water cavities).\n\nA generic progression of phases, going from low to high amphiphile concentration, is:\n* Discontinuous cubic phase ([[micellar cubic]] phase)\n* [[Hexagonal phase]] (hexagonal columnar phase) (middle phase)\n* [[Lamellar phase]]\n* Bicontinuous [[cubic phase]]\n* Reverse hexagonal columnar phase\n* Inverse cubic phase (Inverse micellar phase)\n\nEven within the same phases, their self-assembled structures are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, it is more difficult to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.\n\nSimilar phases and characteristics can be observed in immiscible diblock [[copolymer]]s.\n\n===Metallotropic liquid crystals===\n\nLiquid crystal phases can also be based on low-melting inorganic phases like [[Zinc chloride|ZnCl<sub>2</sub>]] that have a structure formed of linked tetrahedra and easily form glasses. The addition of long chain soap-like molecules leads to a series of new phases that show a variety of liquid crystalline behavior both as a function of the inorganic-organic composition ratio and of temperature. This class of materials has been named metallotropic.<ref name=martin>{{cite journal| title =Metallotropic liquid crystals formed by surfactant templating of molten metal halides| doi=10.1038/nmat1610|journal=Nature Materials |volume =5|date =2006| pmid =16547520| issue =4|bibcode = 2006NatMa...5..271M| last1 =Martin| first1 =James D.| last2 =Keary| first2 =Cristin L.| last3 =Thornton| first3 =Todd A.| last4 =Novotnak| first4 =Mark P.| last5 =Knutson| first5 =Jeremey W.| last6 =Folmer| first6 =Jacob C.

As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, [[differential scanning calorimetry]] (DSC),<ref name=\"Tomczyk2017\" /> allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.\n\nLyotropic mesophases are analyzed in a similar fashion, though these experiments are somewhat more complex, as the concentration of mesogen is a key factor. These experiments are run at various concentrations of [[mesogen]] in order to analyze that impact.\n\n==Biological liquid crystals==\nLyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems, the study of which is referred to as [[lipid polymorphism]]. Accordingly, lyotropic liquid crystals attract particular attention in the field of biomimetic chemistry. In particular, [[biological membrane]]s and [[cell membranes]] are a form of liquid crystal. Their constituent molecules (e.g. [[phospholipid]]s) are perpendicular to the membrane surface, yet the membrane is flexible. These lipids vary in shape (see page on [[lipid polymorphism]]). The constituent molecules can inter-mingle easily, but tend not to leave the membrane due to the high energy requirement of this process. Lipid molecules can flip from one side of the membrane to the other, this process being catalyzed by [[flippase]]s and floppases (depending on the direction of movement). These liquid crystal membrane phases can also host important proteins such as receptors freely \"floating\" inside, or partly outside, the membrane, e.g. CCT.\n\nMany other biological structures exhibit liquid-crystal behavior. For instance, the concentrated [[protein]] solution that is extruded by a spider to generate [[spider silk|silk]] is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase. The precise ordering of molecules in silk is critical to its renowned strength.

In the case of liquid crystals, anisotropy in all of these interactions further complicates analysis. There are a number of fairly simple theories, however, that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.\n\n===Director===\n\nAs we already saw above, the nematic liquid crystals are composed of rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector '''''n''''' called the ''director'', is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules in the neighborhood of any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, '''''n''''' and '''''-n''''' are fully equivalent.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Order parameter===\n\n[[File:Nematic-Director.png|thumb|The ''local nematic director'', which is also the ''local optical axis'', is given by the spatial and temporal average of the long molecular axes]]\n\nThe description of liquid crystals involves an analysis of order. A second rank symmetric traceless tensor order parameter is used to describe the orientational order of a nematic liquid crystal, although a scalar order parameter is usually sufficient to describe uniaxial nematic liquid crystals. To make this quantitative, an orientational order parameter is usually defined based on the average of the second [[Legendre polynomial]]:\n\n:<math>S = \\langle P_2(\\cos \\theta) \\rangle = \\left \\langle \\frac{3 \\cos^2(\\theta) - 1}{2} \\right \\rangle</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the angle between the liquid-crystal molecular axis and the ''local director'' (which is the 'preferred direction' in a volume element of a liquid crystal sample, also representing its ''[[optical axis|local optical axis]]''). The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average. This definition is convenient, since for a completely random and isotropic sample, ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S=1. For a typical liquid crystal sample, ''S'' is on the order of 0.3 to 0.8, and generally decreases as the temperature is raised. In particular, a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase.<ref>{{cite journal|title = A model for the orientational order in liquid crystals| doi =10.1007/BF02453342|journal=Il Nuovo Cimento D|volume = 4| issue =3|date =1984| page = 229|bibcode = 1984NCimD...4..229G|last1 = Ghosh|first1 = S. K. }}</ref> The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways; for instance, [[diamagnetism]], [[birefringence]], [[Raman scattering]], [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[Electron Paramagnetic Resonance|EPR]] can be used to determine S.<ref name=b5/>\n\nThe order of a liquid crystal could also be characterized by using other even Legendre polynomials (all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director can point in either of two antiparallel directions). These higher-order averages are more difficult to measure, but can yield additional information about molecular ordering.<ref name=b2/>\n\nA positional order parameter is also used to describe the ordering of a liquid crystal. It is characterized by the variation of the density of the center of mass of the liquid crystal molecules along a given vector. In the case of positional variation along the ''z''-axis the density <math>\\rho (z)</math> is often given by:\n\n:<math>\\rho (\\mathbf{r}) = \\rho (z) = \\rho_0 + \\rho_1\\cos(q_sz - \\varphi) + \\cdots \\, </math>\n\nThe complex positional order parameter is defined as <math>\\psi (\\mathbf{r}) = \\rho_1 (\\mathbf{r})e^{i\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})}</math> and <math>\\rho_0</math> the average density. Typically only the first two terms are kept and higher order terms are ignored since most phases can be described adequately using sinusoidal functions. For a perfect nematic <math>\\psi = 0</math> and for a smectic phase <math>\\psi</math> will take on complex values. The complex nature of this order parameter allows for many parallels between nematic to smectic phase transitions and conductor to superconductor transitions.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Onsager hard-rod model===\n{{unsolved|physics|Can the nematic to smectic (A) phase transition in liquid crystal states be characterized as a [[background independence|universal]] phase transition?}}\nA simple model which predicts lyotropic phase transitions is the hard-rod model proposed by [[Lars Onsager]]. This theory considers the volume excluded from the center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, there is very little volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a ''decrease'' in the net positional [[entropy]] of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume = 51| issue =4|date = 1949| page = 627| doi =10.1111/j.1749-6632.1949.tb27296.x|title=The effects of shape on the interaction of colloidal particles|bibcode = 1949NYASA..51..627O| last1=Onsager| first1=Lars }}</ref><ref name=vroege>{{cite journal| title = Phase transitions in lyotropic colloidal and polymer liquid crystals| doi= 10.1088/0034-4885/55/8/003|journal=Rep.

This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod-shaped objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a nematic phase. Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems.<ref name=vroege/>\n\n===Maier\u2013Saupe mean field theory===\nThis statistical theory, proposed by [[Alfred Saupe]] and Wilhelm Maier, includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced dipole moment between adjacent rod-like liquid crystal molecules. The anisotropic attraction stabilizes parallel alignment of neighboring molecules, and the theory then considers a [[mean-field theory|mean-field]] average of the interaction. Solved self-consistently, this theory predicts thermotropic nematic-isotropic phase transitions, consistent with experiment.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Maier W. and Saupe A.| journal=Z. Naturforsch.

It predicts that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the strength of the short-range interaction between the molecules. As a result, it allows for a triple critical point where the nematic, isotropic, and smectic A phase meet. Although it predicts the existence of a triple critical point, it does not successfully predict its value. The model utilizes two order parameters that describe the orientational and positional order of the liquid crystal. The first is simply the average of the second [[Legendre polynomials|Legendre polynomial]] and the second order parameter is given by:\n\n: <math>\\sigma = \\left\\langle\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z_i}{d}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\left(\\theta_i\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right\\rangle</math>\n\nThe values ''z<sub>i</sub>, \u03b8<sub>i</sub>'', and ''d'' are the position of the molecule, the angle between the molecular axis and director, and the layer spacing. The postulated potential energy of a single molecule is given by:\n\n:<math>U_i(\\theta_i, z_i) = -U_0\\left(S + \\alpha\\sigma\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z_i}{d}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\left(\\theta_i\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)</math>\n\nHere constant \u03b1 quantifies the strength of the interaction between adjacent molecules. The potential is then used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium. It results in two self-consistency equations that must be solved numerically, the solutions of which are the three stable phases of the liquid crystal.<ref name=b5/>\n\n===Elastic continuum theory===\nIn this formalism, a liquid crystal material is treated as a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the [[Frank free energy density]]. One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) '''twists''' of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) '''splay''' of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) '''bend''' of the material, where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions. Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling liquid crystal devices <ref>{{cite journal|title = Continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals| journal=Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics|volume = 4|date= 1992| issue =3| page = 167| doi =10.1007/BF01130288|bibcode = 1992CMT.....4..167L|last1 = Leslie|first1 = F.

Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director.\n\n===Electric and magnetic field effects===\nThe ability of the director to align along an external field is caused by the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2014|title=Historical Overview of Polar Liquid Crystals|journal=Ferroelectrics|volume=468|pages=1\u201317|doi=10.1080/00150193.2014.932653|last1=Takezoe|first1=Hideo}}</ref>\n\nEven if a molecule does not form a permanent dipole, it can still be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While not as strong as permanent dipoles, orientation with the external field still occurs.\n\nThe response of any system to an external electrical field is\n\n: <math>D_i = \\epsilon_0 E_i + P_i</math>\n\nwhere <math>E_i</math>, <math>D_i</math> and <math>P_i</math> are the components of the electric field, electric displacement field and polarization density. The electric energy per volume stored in the system is\n\n: <math>f_\\text{elec} = -\\frac{1}{2} D_i E_i</math>\n\n(summation over the doubly appearing index <math>i</math>). In nematic liquid crystals, the polarization, and electric displacement both depend linearly on the direction of the electric field. The polarization should be even in the director since liquid crystals are invariants under reflexions of <math>n</math>. The most general form to express <math>D</math> is\n\n: <math>D_i = \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_\\bot E_i + \\left(\\epsilon_\\parallel - \\epsilon_\\bot\\right) n_i n_j E_j </math>\n\n(summation over the index <math>j</math>) with <math>\\epsilon_\\bot</math> and <math>\\epsilon_\\parallel</math> the electric [[permittivity]] parallel and perpendicular to the director <math>n</math>.

There are both <math>\\Delta\\epsilon > 0</math> and <math>\\Delta\\epsilon < 0</math> commercial liquid crystals. [[5CB]] and [[E7 liquid crystal mixture]] are two <math>\\Delta\\epsilon > 0</math> liquid crystals commonly used. [[MBBA]] is a common <math>\\Delta\\epsilon < 0</math> liquid crystal.\n\nThe effects of magnetic fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges, permanent magnetic dipoles are produced by electrons moving about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field. Electromagnetic radiation, e.g. UV-Visible light, can influence light-responsive liquid crystals which mainly carry at least a photo-switchable unit.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017|title=photoswitchable liquid crystal design|journal=Synthesis|volume=49|issue=6|pages=1214\u20131222|doi=10.1055/s-0036-1588913|last1=Kazem-Rostami|first1=Masoud}}</ref>\n\n===Surface preparations===\nIn the absence of an external field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.\n\nSeveral liquid crystal chemicals also align to a 'command surface' which is in turn aligned by electric field of polarized light. This process is called [[photoalignment]].\n\n===[[Fr\u00e9edericksz transition|Fredericks transition]]===\nThe competition between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider the case in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the surface and an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.\n\nThe Fredericks transition is fundamental to the operation of many liquid crystal displays because the director orientation (and thus the properties) can be controlled easily by the application of a field.\n\n==Effect of chirality==\nAs already described, [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] liquid-crystal molecules usually give rise to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a [[stereogenic]] center. An additional requirement is that the system not be [[racemic]]: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, a small amount of chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.\n\nChiral phases usually have a helical twisting of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is on the order of the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as [[polarizer|polarization filters]].<ref>{{cite journal| title = Video camera system using liquid-crystal polarizing filter toreduce reflected light| doi =10.1109/11.735903|journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting|volume = 44| issue =4|date = 1998| page = 419| last1 = Fujikake| first1 = H.| last2 = Takizawa| first2 = K.| last3 = Aida| first3 = T.| last4 = Negishi| first4 = T.| last5 = Kobayashi| first5 = M.}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and [[molecular weight]], DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is of the formation of chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Switching of banana liquid crystal mesophases under field| doi =10.1140/epje/e2003-00016-y|journal=European Physical Journal E| volume = 10|date = 2003| pmid =15011066| issue =2|bibcode = 2003EPJE...10..129A|last1 = Achard|first1 = M.F.|last2 = Bedel|first2 = J.Ph.|last3 = Marcerou|first3 = J.P.|last4 = Nguyen|first4 = H.T.|last5 = Rouillon|first5 = J.C.|pages = 129\u201334 }}</ref> In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present. The appearance mechanism of this macroscopic chirality is not yet entirely clear. It appears that the molecules stack in layers and orient themselves in a tilted fashion inside the layers. These liquid crystals phases may be [[ferroelectric]] or anti-ferroelectric, both of which are of interest for applications.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Ferroelectric nematic liquid-crystal phases of dipolar hard ellipsoids|journal=Phys.

In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 \u03bcm thick) sits between two [[polarizer]]s that are crossed (oriented at 90\u00b0 to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see [[Twisted nematic field effect]]).<ref name=castellano/> This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels.<ref name=castellano/> Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Integrating liquid crystal based optical devices in photonic crystal| doi = 10.1007/s11082-007-9139-8|journal=Optical and Quantum Electronics|volume = 39| issue =12\u201313|date =2007| page = 1009|last1 = Alkeskjold|first1 = Thomas Tanggaard|last2 = Scolari|first2 = Lara|last3 = Noordegraaf|first3 = Danny|last4 = L\u00e6gsgaard|first4 = Jesper|last5 = Weirich|first5 = Johannes|last6 = Wei|first6 = Lei|last7 = Tartarini|first7 = Giovanni|last8 = Bassi|first8 = Paolo|last9 = Gauza|first9 = Sebastian| last10 = Wu| first10 = Shin-Tson| last11 = Bjarklev| first11 = Anders}}</ref>\n\n[[Liquid crystal tunable filter]]s are used as [[electrooptical]] devices,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PKwlrW-CrxUC&pg=PA16|title=Piezoelectric Nanomaterials for Biomedical Applications|last=Ciofani|first=Gianni|last2=Menciassi|first2=Arianna|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9783642280443}}</ref> e.g., in [[hyperspectral imaging]].\n\n[[thermochromism|Thermotropic]] chiral LCs whose pitch varies strongly with temperature can be used as crude [[liquid crystal thermometer]]s, since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed.

For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its [[molecules]] may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid-crystal [[Phase (matter)|phases]], which can be distinguished by their different [[Optics|optical]] properties (such as [[Texture (crystalline)|textures]]). The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal state of matter (just as water may turn into ice or water vapor).\n\nLiquid crystals can be divided into [[thermotropic]], [[lyotropic]] and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of [[organic molecules]], although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a [[phase transition]] into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and [[concentration]] of the liquid-crystal molecules in a [[solvent]] (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.\n\nExamples of liquid crystals can be found both in the natural world and in technological applications. Widespread [[Liquid-crystal display]]s use liquid crystals. Lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems but can also be found in the mineral world. For example, many proteins and cell membranes are liquid crystals. Other well-known examples of liquid crystals are solutions of [[soap]] and various related [[detergent]]s, as well as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]], and some [[clays]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1888, Austrian botanical physiologist [[Friedrich Reinitzer]], working at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universit\u00e4t]], examined the physico-chemical properties of various [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of [[cholesterol]] which now belong to the class of materials known as cholesteric liquid crystals. Previously, other researchers had observed distinct color effects when cooling cholesterol derivatives just above the [[freezing point]], but had not associated it with a new phenomenon. Reinitzer perceived that color changes in a derivative [[cholesteryl benzoate]] were not the most peculiar feature.[[File:Cholesteryl benzoate.png|thumb|250 px|Chemical structure of [[cholesteryl benzoate]] molecule]] He found that cholesteryl benzoate does not [[melting|melt]] in the same manner as other compounds, but has two [[melting point]]s. At {{convert|145.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} it melts into a cloudy liquid, and at {{convert|178.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} it melts again and the cloudy liquid becomes clear. The phenomenon is reversible. Seeking help from a physicist, on March 14, 1888, he wrote to [[Otto Lehmann (physicist)|Otto Lehmann]], at that time a ''{{lang|de|[[Privatdozent]]}}'' in [[Aachen]]. They exchanged letters and samples. Lehmann examined the intermediate cloudy fluid, and reported seeing [[crystallite]]s. Reinitzer's Viennese colleague von Zepharovich also indicated that the intermediate \"fluid\" was crystalline. The exchange of letters with Lehmann ended on April 24, with many questions unanswered. Reinitzer presented his results, with credits to Lehmann and von Zepharovich, at a meeting of the Vienna Chemical Society on May 3, 1888.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss des Cholesterins| journal=Monatshefte f\u00fcr Chemie| volume = 9| issue =1| pages = 421\u2013441|date =1888| doi =10.1007/BF01516710| last1 = Reinitzer| first1 = Friedrich}}</ref>\n\nBy that time, Reinitzer had discovered and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): the existence of two melting points, the reflection of [[circular polarization|circularly polarized light]], and the ability to rotate the polarization direction of light.\n\nAfter his accidental discovery, Reinitzer did not pursue studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who realized that he had encountered a new phenomenon and was in a position to investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the [[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=Lehmann, O. |doi=10.1515/zpch-1889-0434| title = \u00dcber fliessende Krystalle| journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie|volume =4| pages = 462\u201372|date =1889}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Otto Lehmann.jpg|thumb|180px|Otto Lehmann]]\nLehmann's work was continued and significantly expanded by the German chemist [[Daniel Vorl\u00e4nder]], who from the beginning of 20th century until his retirement in 1935, had synthesized most of the liquid crystals known. However, liquid crystals were not popular among scientists and the material remained a pure scientific curiosity for about 80 years.<ref name=b3/>\n\nAfter World War II work on the synthesis of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. [[George William Gray]], a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed a better understanding of how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book ''Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals''<ref>Gray, G. W. (1962) ''Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals'', Academic Press</ref> became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the [[University of Cincinnati]] and later at [[Kent State University]]. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world's top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13583149408628630|title=Professor Horst Sackmann, 1921 \u2013 1993|date=1994|last1=Stegemeyer|first1=H|journal=Liquid Crystals Today|volume=4|pages=1\u20132}}</ref><ref>[http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm Liquid Crystals] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120805230930/http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm |date=August 5, 2012 }}. kfupm.edu.sa</ref>\n\nLiquid crystal materials became a focus of research in the development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at [[RCA]] Laboratories.<ref name=castellano/> When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a [[#Nematic_phase|nematic]] liquid crystal at 125&nbsp;\u00b0C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague [[George H. Heilmeier]] to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the [[para-Azoxyanisole]] that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116&nbsp;\u00b0C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.\n\nIn 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, research chemists in Heilmeier group at RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed only in the number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of [[Schiff base]] compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22\u2013105&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>Goldmacher, Joel E. and Castellano, Joseph A. \"Electro-optical Compositions and Devices,\" {{US Patent|3540796}}, Issue date: November 17, 1970.</ref> Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1652453|title=Dynamic Scattering in Nematic Liquid Crystals|date=1968|last1=Heilmeier|first1=G.

This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide [[operating temperature]] range eventually became the industry standard and is still used to tailor materials to meet specific applications.\n\n[[File:MBBA cleaner.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of [[MBBA|N-(4-Methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline (MBBA)]] molecule]]\nIn 1969, Hans Kelker succeeded in synthesizing a substance that had a nematic phase at room temperature, [[MBBA]], which is one of the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Angew.

There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotic, conic (bowlic), and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a conic LC is not flat, but is shaped like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object).<ref>Lam, Lui (1994). \"Bowlics\".

One can distinguish positional order (whether molecules are arranged in any sort of ordered lattice) and orientational order (whether molecules are mostly pointing in the same direction), and moreover order can be either short-range (only between molecules close to each other) or long-range (extending to larger, sometimes [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]], dimensions). Most thermotropic LCs will have an [[isotropic]] phase at high temperature. That is that heating will eventually drive them into a conventional liquid phase characterized by random and isotropic molecular ordering (little to no long-range order), and [[fluid]]-like flow behavior. Under other conditions (for instance, lower temperature), a LC might inhabit one or more phases with significant  [[anisotropic]] orientational structure and short-range orientational order while still having an ability to flow.<ref name=b2>\n{{cite book|author=Chandrasekhar, S.|title=Liquid Crystals|edition = 2nd|location = Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1992|isbn=978-0-521-41747-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TxvUxFlQsEsC&printsec=frontcover|author-link=Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar}}\n</ref><ref name=b1>\n{{cite book|author=[[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes|de Gennes, P.G.]] and Prost, J|title=The Physics of Liquid Crystals|location = Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|date=1993|isbn=978-0-19-852024-5}}\n</ref>\n\nThe ordering of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends up to the entire domain size, which may be on the order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical [[crystal]]line solids.

This term originates from the thread-like [[topological defect]]s observed in nematics, which are formally called '[[disclination]]s'. Nematics also exhibit so-called \"hedgehog\" topological defects. In a nematic phase, the ''calamitic'' or rod-shaped organic molecules have no positional order, but they self-align to have long-range directional order with their long axes roughly parallel.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.csupomona.edu/~jarego/pubs/RD2_LC.pdf |title=Asymmetric synthesis of a highly soluble 'trimeric' analogue of the chiral nematic liquid crystal twist agent Merck S1011 |last=Rego |first=J.A. |last2=Harvey |first2=Jamie A.A. |last3=MacKinnon |first3=Andrew L. |last4=Gatdula |first4=Elysse |journal=Liquid Crystals |volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 2010 |pages=37\u201343 |doi=10.1080/02678290903359291 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008152304/http://www.csupomona.edu/~jarego/pubs/RD2_LC.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Thus, the molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid, but still maintain their long-range directional order.

The chiral nematic phase (left), also called the cholesteric phase, and the smectic C* phase (right).]]\nThe [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[nematic]] phase exhibits [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] (handedness). This phase is often called the [[Cholesteric liquid crystal|''cholesteric'']] phase because it was first observed for [[cholesterol]] derivatives. Only [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral molecules]] can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle with respect to the layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.<ref name=b1/><ref name=b4/><ref name=b5/>\n\n[[File:Cholesterinisch.png|thumb|Chiral nematic phase; p refers to the chiral pitch (see text)]]\nThe ''chiral pitch'', p, refers to the distance over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360\u00b0 twist (but note that the structure of the chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0\u00b0 and \u00b1180\u00b0 are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]].

Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.\n\nThe content of water or other solvent molecules changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into [[micelle]]s or [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.\n\nThe objects created by amphiphiles are usually spherical (as in the case of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These anisotropic self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves in much the same way as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).\n\nFor some systems, at high concentrations, inverse phases are observed. That is, one may generate an inverse hexagonal columnar phase (columns of water encapsulated by amphiphiles) or an inverse micellar phase (a bulk liquid crystal sample with spherical water cavities).\n\nA generic progression of phases, going from low to high amphiphile concentration, is:\n* Discontinuous cubic phase ([[micellar cubic]] phase)\n* [[Hexagonal phase]] (hexagonal columnar phase) (middle phase)\n* [[Lamellar phase]]\n* Bicontinuous [[cubic phase]]\n* Reverse hexagonal columnar phase\n* Inverse cubic phase (Inverse micellar phase)\n\nEven within the same phases, their self-assembled structures are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, it is more difficult to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.\n\nSimilar phases and characteristics can be observed in immiscible diblock [[copolymer]]s.\n\n===Metallotropic liquid crystals===\n\nLiquid crystal phases can also be based on low-melting inorganic phases like [[Zinc chloride|ZnCl<sub>2</sub>]] that have a structure formed of linked tetrahedra and easily form glasses. The addition of long chain soap-like molecules leads to a series of new phases that show a variety of liquid crystalline behavior both as a function of the inorganic-organic composition ratio and of temperature.

As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, [[differential scanning calorimetry]] (DSC),<ref name=\"Tomczyk2017\" /> allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.\n\nLyotropic mesophases are analyzed in a similar fashion, though these experiments are somewhat more complex, as the concentration of mesogen is a key factor. These experiments are run at various concentrations of [[mesogen]] in order to analyze that impact.\n\n==Biological liquid crystals==\nLyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems, the study of which is referred to as [[lipid polymorphism]]. Accordingly, lyotropic liquid crystals attract particular attention in the field of biomimetic chemistry. In particular, [[biological membrane]]s and [[cell membranes]] are a form of liquid crystal. Their constituent molecules (e.g. [[phospholipid]]s) are perpendicular to the membrane surface, yet the membrane is flexible. These lipids vary in shape (see page on [[lipid polymorphism]]). The constituent molecules can inter-mingle easily, but tend not to leave the membrane due to the high energy requirement of this process. Lipid molecules can flip from one side of the membrane to the other, this process being catalyzed by [[flippase]]s and floppases (depending on the direction of movement). These liquid crystal membrane phases can also host important proteins such as receptors freely \"floating\" inside, or partly outside, the membrane, e.g. CCT.\n\nMany other biological structures exhibit liquid-crystal behavior. For instance, the concentrated [[protein]] solution that is extruded by a spider to generate [[spider silk|silk]] is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase. The precise ordering of molecules in silk is critical to its renowned strength.

There are a number of fairly simple theories, however, that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.\n\n===Director===\n\nAs we already saw above, the nematic liquid crystals are composed of rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector '''''n''''' called the ''director'', is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules in the neighborhood of any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, '''''n''''' and '''''-n''''' are fully equivalent.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Order parameter===\n\n[[File:Nematic-Director.png|thumb|The ''local nematic director'', which is also the ''local optical axis'', is given by the spatial and temporal average of the long molecular axes]]\n\nThe description of liquid crystals involves an analysis of order. A second rank symmetric traceless tensor order parameter is used to describe the orientational order of a nematic liquid crystal, although a scalar order parameter is usually sufficient to describe uniaxial nematic liquid crystals. To make this quantitative, an orientational order parameter is usually defined based on the average of the second [[Legendre polynomial]]:\n\n:<math>S = \\langle P_2(\\cos \\theta) \\rangle = \\left \\langle \\frac{3 \\cos^2(\\theta) - 1}{2} \\right \\rangle</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the angle between the liquid-crystal molecular axis and the ''local director'' (which is the 'preferred direction' in a volume element of a liquid crystal sample, also representing its ''[[optical axis|local optical axis]]''). The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average. This definition is convenient, since for a completely random and isotropic sample, ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S=1. For a typical liquid crystal sample, ''S'' is on the order of 0.3 to 0.8, and generally decreases as the temperature is raised. In particular, a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase.<ref>{{cite journal|title = A model for the orientational order in liquid crystals| doi =10.1007/BF02453342|journal=Il Nuovo Cimento D|volume = 4| issue =3|date =1984| page = 229|bibcode = 1984NCimD...4..229G|last1 = Ghosh|first1 = S. K. }}</ref> The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways; for instance, [[diamagnetism]], [[birefringence]], [[Raman scattering]], [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[Electron Paramagnetic Resonance|EPR]] can be used to determine S.<ref name=b5/>\n\nThe order of a liquid crystal could also be characterized by using other even Legendre polynomials (all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director can point in either of two antiparallel directions). These higher-order averages are more difficult to measure, but can yield additional information about molecular ordering.<ref name=b2/>\n\nA positional order parameter is also used to describe the ordering of a liquid crystal. It is characterized by the variation of the density of the center of mass of the liquid crystal molecules along a given vector. In the case of positional variation along the ''z''-axis the density <math>\\rho (z)</math> is often given by:\n\n:<math>\\rho (\\mathbf{r}) = \\rho (z) = \\rho_0 + \\rho_1\\cos(q_sz - \\varphi) + \\cdots \\, </math>\n\nThe complex positional order parameter is defined as <math>\\psi (\\mathbf{r}) = \\rho_1 (\\mathbf{r})e^{i\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})}</math> and <math>\\rho_0</math> the average density. Typically only the first two terms are kept and higher order terms are ignored since most phases can be described adequately using sinusoidal functions. For a perfect nematic <math>\\psi = 0</math> and for a smectic phase <math>\\psi</math> will take on complex values. The complex nature of this order parameter allows for many parallels between nematic to smectic phase transitions and conductor to superconductor transitions.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Onsager hard-rod model===\n{{unsolved|physics|Can the nematic to smectic (A) phase transition in liquid crystal states be characterized as a [[background independence|universal]] phase transition?}}\nA simple model which predicts lyotropic phase transitions is the hard-rod model proposed by [[Lars Onsager]]. This theory considers the volume excluded from the center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, there is very little volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a ''decrease'' in the net positional [[entropy]] of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume = 51| issue =4|date = 1949| page = 627| doi =10.1111/j.1749-6632.1949.tb27296.x|title=The effects of shape on the interaction of colloidal particles|bibcode = 1949NYASA..51..627O| last1=Onsager| first1=Lars }}</ref><ref name=vroege>{{cite journal| title = Phase transitions in lyotropic colloidal and polymer liquid crystals| doi= 10.1088/0034-4885/55/8/003|journal=Rep.

Thus in some case greater positional order will be entropically favorable. This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod-shaped objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a nematic phase. Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems.<ref name=vroege/>\n\n===Maier\u2013Saupe mean field theory===\nThis statistical theory, proposed by [[Alfred Saupe]] and Wilhelm Maier, includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced dipole moment between adjacent rod-like liquid crystal molecules. The anisotropic attraction stabilizes parallel alignment of neighboring molecules, and the theory then considers a [[mean-field theory|mean-field]] average of the interaction. Solved self-consistently, this theory predicts thermotropic nematic-isotropic phase transitions, consistent with experiment.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Maier W. and Saupe A.| journal=Z. Naturforsch.

It predicts that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the strength of the short-range interaction between the molecules. As a result, it allows for a triple critical point where the nematic, isotropic, and smectic A phase meet. Although it predicts the existence of a triple critical point, it does not successfully predict its value. The model utilizes two order parameters that describe the orientational and positional order of the liquid crystal. The first is simply the average of the second [[Legendre polynomials|Legendre polynomial]] and the second order parameter is given by:\n\n: <math>\\sigma = \\left\\langle\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z_i}{d}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\left(\\theta_i\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right\\rangle</math>\n\nThe values ''z<sub>i</sub>, \u03b8<sub>i</sub>'', and ''d'' are the position of the molecule, the angle between the molecular axis and director, and the layer spacing. The postulated potential energy of a single molecule is given by:\n\n:<math>U_i(\\theta_i, z_i) = -U_0\\left(S + \\alpha\\sigma\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z_i}{d}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\left(\\theta_i\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)</math>\n\nHere constant \u03b1 quantifies the strength of the interaction between adjacent molecules. The potential is then used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium. It results in two self-consistency equations that must be solved numerically, the solutions of which are the three stable phases of the liquid crystal.<ref name=b5/>\n\n===Elastic continuum theory===\nIn this formalism, a liquid crystal material is treated as a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the [[Frank free energy density]]. One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) '''twists''' of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) '''splay''' of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) '''bend''' of the material, where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions. Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling liquid crystal devices <ref>{{cite journal|title = Continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals| journal=Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics|volume = 4|date= 1992| issue =3| page = 167| doi =10.1007/BF01130288|bibcode = 1992CMT.....4..167L|last1 = Leslie|first1 = F.

Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director.\n\n===Electric and magnetic field effects===\nThe ability of the director to align along an external field is caused by the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2014|title=Historical Overview of Polar Liquid Crystals|journal=Ferroelectrics|volume=468|pages=1\u201317|doi=10.1080/00150193.2014.932653|last1=Takezoe|first1=Hideo}}</ref>\n\nEven if a molecule does not form a permanent dipole, it can still be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While not as strong as permanent dipoles, orientation with the external field still occurs.\n\nThe response of any system to an external electrical field is\n\n: <math>D_i = \\epsilon_0 E_i + P_i</math>\n\nWhere <math>E</math>, <math>D</math> and <math>P</math> are the electric field, electric displacement field and polarization density.

[[MBBA]] is a common <math>\\Delta\\epsilon < 0</math> liquid crystal.\n\nThe effects of magnetic fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges, permanent magnetic dipoles are produced by electrons moving about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field. Electromagnetic radiation, e.g. UV-Visible light, can influence light-responsive liquid crystals which mainly carry at least a photo-switchable unit.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017|title=photoswitchable liquid crystal design|journal=Synthesis|volume=49|issue=6|pages=1214\u20131222|doi=10.1055/s-0036-1588913|last1=Kazem-Rostami|first1=Masoud}}</ref>\n\n===Surface preparations===\nIn the absence of an external field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.\n\nSeveral liquid crystal chemicals also align to a 'command surface' which is in turn aligned by electric field of polarized light. This process is called [[photoalignment]].\n\n===[[Fr\u00e9edericksz transition|Fredericks transition]]===\nThe competition between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider the case in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the surface and an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.\n\nThe Fredericks transition is fundamental to the operation of many liquid crystal displays because the director orientation (and thus the properties) can be controlled easily by the application of a field.\n\n==Effect of chirality==\nAs already described, [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] liquid-crystal molecules usually give rise to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a [[stereogenic]] center. An additional requirement is that the system not be [[racemic]]: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, a small amount of chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.\n\nChiral phases usually have a helical twisting of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is on the order of the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as [[polarizer|polarization filters]].<ref>{{cite journal| title = Video camera system using liquid-crystal polarizing filter toreduce reflected light| doi =10.1109/11.735903|journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting|volume = 44| issue =4|date = 1998| page = 419| last1 = Fujikake| first1 = H.| last2 = Takizawa| first2 = K.| last3 = Aida| first3 = T.| last4 = Negishi| first4 = T.| last5 = Kobayashi| first5 = M.}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and [[molecular weight]], DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is of the formation of chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Switching of banana liquid crystal mesophases under field| doi =10.1140/epje/e2003-00016-y|journal=European Physical Journal E| volume = 10|date = 2003| pmid =15011066| issue =2|bibcode = 2003EPJE...10..129A|last1 = Achard|first1 = M.F.|last2 = Bedel|first2 = J.Ph.|last3 = Marcerou|first3 = J.P.|last4 = Nguyen|first4 = H.T.|last5 = Rouillon|first5 = J.C.|pages = 129\u201334 }}</ref> In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present.

In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 \u03bcm thick) sits between two [[polarizer]]s that are crossed (oriented at 90\u00b0 to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see [[Twisted nematic field effect]]).<ref name=castellano/> This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels.<ref name=castellano/> Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators.

He was the sixth king of the [[House of Plantagenet]]. The fourth son of [[Edward I]], Edward became the [[heir apparent]] to the throne following the death of his elder brother [[Alphonso, Earl of Chester|Alphonso]]. Beginning in 1300, Edward accompanied his father on [[Wars of Scottish Independence|campaigns to pacify Scotland]]. In 1306, he was [[knight]]ed in a [[Feast of the Swans|grand ceremony]] at [[Westminster Abbey]]. Following his father's death, Edward succeeded to the throne in 1307. He married [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the daughter of the powerful King [[Philip IV of France]], in 1308, as part of a long-running effort to resolve tensions between the English and French crowns.\n\nEdward had a close and controversial relationship with [[Piers Ione Mohu Gaveston]], who had joined his household in 1300. The precise nature of their relationship is uncertain; they may have been friends, lovers or [[sworn brothers]]. Edward's relationship with Gaveston inspired [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s 1592 play ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'', along with other plays, films, novels and media. Gaveston's power as Edward's [[favourite]] provoked discontent among both the [[baron]]s and the French royal family, and Edward was forced to [[exile]] him. On Gaveston's return, the barons pressured the king into agreeing to wide-ranging reforms, called the [[Ordinances of 1311]]. The newly empowered barons banished Gaveston, to which Edward responded by revoking the reforms and recalling his favourite. Led by Edward's cousin, [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], a group of the barons seized and executed Gaveston in 1312, beginning several years of armed confrontation. English forces were pushed back in Scotland, where Edward was decisively defeated by [[Robert the Bruce]] at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314. [[Great Famine of 1315\u201317|Widespread famine]] followed, and criticism of the king's reign mounted.\n\nThe Despenser family, in particular [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], became close friends and advisers to Edward, but Lancaster and many of the barons seized the Despensers' lands in 1321, and forced the king to exile them. In response, Edward led a [[Despenser War|short military campaign]], capturing and executing Lancaster. Edward and the Despensers strengthened their grip on power, formally revoking the 1311 reforms, executing their enemies and confiscating estates. Unable to make progress in Scotland, Edward finally signed a truce with Robert. Opposition to the regime grew, and when Isabella was sent to France to negotiate a [[War of Saint-Sardos#Aftermath|peace treaty]] in 1325, she turned against Edward and refused to return. Instead, she allied herself with the exiled [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], and [[Invasion of England (1326)|invaded England]] with a small army in 1326. Edward's regime collapsed and he fled to Wales, where he was captured in November. The king was forced to relinquish his crown in January 1327 in favour of his 14-year-old son, [[Edward III]], and he died in [[Berkeley Castle]] on 21 September, probably murdered on the orders of the new regime.\n\nEdward's contemporaries criticised his performance as king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of [[Parliament of England|parliamentary institutions]] during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate over his perceived failures has continued into the 21st century.\n\n==Background==\nEdward II was the fourth son<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=3}}</ref> of [[Edward I, King of England]], [[Lord of Ireland]], and ruler of [[Gascony]] in south-western France (which he held as the [[feudal]] vassal of the [[king of France]]),<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|1988|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> and [[Eleanor, Countess of Ponthieu]] in northern France. Eleanor was from the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] royal family.

One line of argument stemmed from the 1259 treaty agreed by Edward's grandfather, Henry III, under which Henry had agreed to give homage for Gascony; Edward's lawyers observed that this treaty, which underpinned Edward's 1303 treaty with France, had been a bilateral agreement between the two kings, rather than a conventional feudal agreement. As such, Edward's offering homage for Gascony was dependent on the French crown delivering on its own commitments, rather than an absolute duty. Edward's lawyers also argued that Isabella had a potential claim to the lands in the south under customary French law. When granting Gascony to Isabella, Phillip IV appeared to have been dividing up his lands, as was customary at the time, rather than giving a conditional grant, which meant that Gascony was an [[allod]], Edward's personal property, and as such not subject to the French king's laws on the carrying of weapons or money.<ref>{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|pp=322, 387}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=19\u201320, 305\u2013306}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nEdward now expected Isabella and their son to return to England, but instead she remained in France and showed no intention of making her way back.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=485\u2013486}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=169}}</ref> Until 1322, Edward and Isabella's marriage appears to have been successful, but by the time Isabella left for France in 1325, it had deteriorated.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> Isabella appears to have disliked Hugh Despenser the Younger intensely, not least because of his abuse of high-status women.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=74\u201375}}</ref> Isabella was embarrassed that she had fled from Scottish armies three times during her marriage to Edward, and she blamed Hugh for the final occurrence in 1322.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=75\u201377}}</ref> When Edward had negotiated the recent truce with Robert the Bruce, he had severely disadvantaged a range of noble families who owned land in Scotland, including the Beaumonts, close friends of Isabella's.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=437\u2013438}}</ref> She was also angry about the arrest of her household and seizure of her lands in 1324.

1284&nbsp;\u2013 21 September 1327), also called '''Edward of Carnarvon''', was [[King of England]] from 1307 until he was [[deposed]] in January 1327. He was the sixth king of the [[House of Plantagenet]]. The fourth son of [[Edward I]], Edward became the [[heir apparent]] to the throne following the death of his elder brother [[Alphonso, Earl of Chester|Alphonso]]. Beginning in 1300, Edward accompanied his father on [[Wars of Scottish Independence|campaigns to pacify Scotland]]. In 1306, he was [[knight]]ed in a [[Feast of the Swans|grand ceremony]] at [[Westminster Abbey]]. Following his father's death, Edward succeeded to the throne in 1307. He married [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the daughter of the powerful King [[Philip IV of France]], in 1308, as part of a long-running effort to resolve tensions between the English and French crowns.\n\nEdward had a close and controversial relationship with [[Piers Gaveston]], who had joined his household in 1300. The precise nature of their relationship is uncertain; they may have been friends, lovers or [[sworn brothers]]. Edward's relationship with Gaveston inspired [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s 1592 play ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'', along with other plays, films, novels and media. Gaveston's power as Edward's [[favourite]] provoked discontent among both the [[baron]]s and the French royal family, and Edward was forced to [[exile]] him. On Gaveston's return, the barons pressured the king into agreeing to wide-ranging reforms, called the [[Ordinances of 1311]]. The newly empowered barons banished Gaveston, to which Edward responded by revoking the reforms and recalling his favourite. Led by Edward's cousin, [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], a group of the barons seized and executed Gaveston in 1312, beginning several years of armed confrontation. English forces were pushed back in Scotland, where Edward was decisively defeated by [[Robert the Bruce]] at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314. [[Great Famine of 1315\u201317|Widespread famine]] followed, and criticism of the king's reign mounted.\n\nThe Despenser family, in particular [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], became close friends and advisers to Edward, but Lancaster and many of the barons seized the Despensers' lands in 1321, and forced the king to exile them. In response, Edward led a [[Despenser War|short military campaign]], capturing and executing Lancaster. Edward and the Despensers strengthened their grip on power, formally revoking the 1311 reforms, executing their enemies and confiscating estates. Unable to make progress in Scotland, Edward finally signed a truce with Robert. Opposition to the regime grew, and when Isabella was sent to France to negotiate a [[War of Saint-Sardos#Aftermath|peace treaty]] in 1325, she turned against Edward and refused to return. Instead, she allied herself with the exiled [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], and [[Invasion of England (1326)|invaded England]] with a small army in 1326. Edward's regime collapsed and he fled to Wales, where he was captured in November. The king was forced to relinquish his crown in January 1327 in favour of his 14-year-old son, [[Edward III]], and he died in [[Berkeley Castle]] on 21 September, probably murdered on the orders of the new regime.\n\nEdward's contemporaries criticised his performance as king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of [[Parliament of England|parliamentary institutions]] during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate over his perceived failures has continued into the 21st century.\n\n==Background==\nEdward II was the fourth son<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=3}}</ref> of [[Edward I, King of England]], [[Lord of Ireland]], and ruler of [[Gascony]] in south-western France (which he held as the [[feudal]] vassal of the [[king of France]]),<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|1988|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> and [[Eleanor, Countess of Ponthieu]] in northern France. Eleanor was from the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] royal family. Edward I proved a successful military leader, leading the [[Second Barons' War|suppression of the baronial revolts]] in the 1260s and joining the [[Ninth Crusade]].<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=33}}</ref> During the 1280s he [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|conquered North Wales]], removing the [[Welsh people|native Welsh]] princes from power and, in the 1290s, he [[Wars of Scottish Independence|intervened in Scotland's civil war]], claiming [[suzerainty]] over the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=5\u20136}}</ref> He was considered an extremely successful ruler by his contemporaries, largely able to control the powerful [[earl]]s that formed the senior ranks of the English nobility.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Given-Wilson|1996|pp=29\u201330}}</ref> The historian [[Michael Prestwich]] describes Edward I as \"a king to inspire fear and respect\", while [[John Gillingham]] characterises him as an efficient bully.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=5}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/reviews/history/article750063.ece | title=Hard on Wales |mode=cs2 | accessdate=22 April 2014 | last1= Gillingham| first1= John | website=Times Literary Supplement | publisher=Times Literary Supplement | date = 11 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nDespite Edward I's successes, when he died in 1307 he left a range of challenges for his son to resolve.<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=25}}</ref> One of the most critical was the problem of English rule in Scotland, where Edward I's long but ultimately inconclusive military campaign was ongoing when he died.<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=241}}</ref> His control of Gascony created tension with the French kings.<ref name=Brown1988P575>{{harvnb|Brown|1988|p=575}}</ref> They insisted that the English kings give [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to them for the lands; the English kings saw this demand as insulting to their honour, and the issue remained unresolved.<ref name=Brown1988P575/> Edward I also faced increasing opposition from his barons over the taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars, and left his son debts of around \u00a3200,000 on his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=129}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=30\u201331, 93\u201394}}</ref>{{refn|It is impossible to accurately convert sums of medieval money into modern incomes and prices.

One line of argument stemmed from the 1259 treaty agreed by Edward's grandfather, Henry III, under which Henry had agreed to give homage for Gascony; Edward's lawyers observed that this treaty, which underpinned Edward's 1303 treaty with France, had been a bilateral agreement between the two kings, rather than a conventional feudal agreement. As such, Edward's offering homage for Gascony was dependent on the French crown delivering on its own commitments, rather than an absolute duty. Edward's lawyers also argued that Isabella had a potential claim to the lands in the south under customary French law. When granting Gascony to Isabella, Phillip IV appeared to have been dividing up his lands, as was customary at the time, rather than giving a conditional grant, which meant that Gascony was an [[allod]], Edward's personal property, and as such not subject to the French king's laws on the carrying of weapons or money.<ref>{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|pp=322, 387}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=19\u201320, 305\u2013306}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nEdward now expected Isabella and their son to return to England, but instead she remained in France and showed no intention of making her way back.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=485\u2013486}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=169}}</ref> Until 1322, Edward and Isabella's marriage appears to have been successful, but by the time Isabella left for France in 1325, it had deteriorated.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> Isabella appears to have disliked Hugh Despenser the Younger intensely, not least because of his abuse of high-status women.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=74\u201375}}</ref> Isabella was embarrassed that she had fled from Scottish armies three times during her marriage to Edward, and she blamed Hugh for the final occurrence in 1322.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=75\u201377}}</ref> When Edward had negotiated the recent truce with Robert the Bruce, he had severely disadvantaged a range of noble families who owned land in Scotland, including the Beaumonts, close friends of Isabella's.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=437\u2013438}}</ref> She was also angry about the arrest of her household and seizure of her lands in 1324.

{"title_page": "Context-free grammar", "text_new": "{{Short description|Type of formal grammar}}{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}{{more citations needed|date=February 2012}}\n{{merge from|Useless rules|date=February 2019|discuss=Talk:Useless rules#Proposed merge}}\n[[File:C grammar example derivation svg.svg|thumb|600px|Simplified excerpt of the formal grammar for the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] (left), and a derivation of a piece of C code (right) from the nonterminal symbol <math>\\langle\\text{Stmt}\\rangle</math>. Nonterminal and terminal symbols are shown in blue and red, respectively.]]\nIn [[formal language]] theory, a '''context-free grammar''' ('''CFG''') is a [[formal grammar]] in which every [[Production (computer science)|production rule]] is of the form\n\n:<math>A\\ \\to\\ \\alpha</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is a ''single'' [[nonterminal]] symbol, and <math>\\alpha</math> is a string of [[Terminal and nonterminal symbols|terminal]]s and/or nonterminals (<math>\\alpha</math> can be empty). A formal grammar is considered \"context free\" when its production rules can be applied regardless of the context of a nonterminal. No matter which symbols surround it, the single nonterminal on the left hand side can always be replaced by the right hand side. This is what distinguishes it from a [[context-sensitive grammar]].\n\nA formal grammar is essentially a set of production rules that describe all possible strings in a given formal language. Production rules are simple replacements. For example, the first rule in the picture,\n\n:<math>\\langle\\text{Stmt}\\rangle \\to \\langle\\text{Id}\\rangle = \\langle\\text{Expr}\\rangle ;</math>\n\nreplaces <math>\\langle\\text{Stmt}\\rangle</math> with <math>\\langle\\text{Id}\\rangle = \\langle\\text{Expr}\\rangle ;</math>. There can be multiple replacement rules for a given nonterminal symbol. The language generated by a grammar is the set of all strings of terminal symbols that can be derived, by repeated rule applications, from some particular nonterminal symbol (\"start symbol\").\nNonterminal symbols are used during the derivation process, but may not appear in its final result string. \n\n[[formal language|Language]]s generated by context-free grammars are known as [[context-free language]]s (CFL). Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. It is important to distinguish the properties of the language (intrinsic properties) from the properties of a particular grammar (extrinsic properties). The [[#Language equality|language equality]] question (do two given context-free grammars generate the same language?) is [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]].\n\nContext-free grammars arise in [[linguistics]] where they are used to describe the structure of sentences and words in a [[natural language]], and they were in fact invented by the linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] for this purpose. By contrast, in [[computer science]], as the use of recursively-defined concepts increased, they were used more and more. In an early application, grammars are used to describe the structure of [[programming language]]s. In a newer application, they are used in an essential part of the [[Extensible Markup Language]] (XML) called the ''[[Document Type Definition]]''.<ref>''Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation'', John E. Hopcroft, Rajeev Motwani, Jeffrey D. Ullman, Addison Wesley, 2001, p.191</ref>\n\nIn [[linguistics]], some authors use the term '''[[phrase structure grammar]]''' to refer to context-free grammars, whereby phrase-structure grammars are distinct from [[dependency grammar]]s. In [[computer science]], a popular notation for context-free grammars is [[Backus\u2013Naur form]], or ''BNF''.\n\n== Background ==\n\nSince the time of [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]], at least, linguists have described the [[grammar]]s of languages in terms of their block structure, and described how sentences are [[recursion|recursively]] built up from smaller phrases, and eventually individual words or word elements. An essential property of these block structures is that logical units never overlap. For example, the sentence:\n: ''John, whose blue car was in the garage, walked to the grocery store.''\ncan be logically parenthesized (with the logical metasymbols '''[ ]''') as follows:\n: '''['''''John'''''[''', '''['''''whose '''''['''''blue car''''']]''' '''['''''was '''''['''''in '''''['''''the garage''''']]]''',''']]''' '''['''''walked '''''['''''to '''''['''''the '''''['''''grocery store''''']]]]'''.\nA context-free grammar provides a simple and mathematically precise mechanism for describing the methods by which phrases in some natural language are built from smaller blocks, capturing the \"block structure\" of sentences in a natural way. Its simplicity makes the formalism amenable to rigorous mathematical study. Important features of natural language syntax such as [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] and [[reference]] are not part of the context-free grammar, but the basic recursive structure of sentences, the way in which clauses nest inside other clauses, and the way in which lists of adjectives and adverbs are swallowed by nouns and verbs, is described exactly.\n\nContext-free grammars are a special form of [[Semi-Thue system]]s that in their general form date back to the work of [[Axel Thue]].\n\nThe formalism of context-free grammars was developed in the mid-1950s by [[Noam Chomsky]],<ref name=\"hu106\">{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, p.&nbsp;106.</ref> and also their [[Chomsky hierarchy|classification as a special type]] of [[formal grammar]] (which he called [[phrase-structure grammar]]s).<ref name=\"chomsky1956\">{{citation\n | last = Chomsky | first = Noam | authorlink =\n | title = Three models for the description of language\n | journal = IEEE Transactions on Information Theory\n | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 113\u2013124\n | date = Sep 1956\n | doi = 10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813| id = }}</ref> What Chomsky called a phrase structure grammar is also known now as a constituency grammar, whereby constituency grammars stand in contrast to [[dependency grammar]]s. In Chomsky's [[generative grammar]] framework, the syntax of natural language was described by context-free rules combined with transformation rules.\n\nBlock structure was introduced into computer [[programming language]]s by the [[Algol (programming language)|Algol]] project (1957\u20131960), which, as a consequence, also featured a context-free grammar to describe the resulting Algol syntax. This became a standard feature of computer languages, and the notation for grammars used in concrete descriptions of computer languages came to be known as [[Backus\u2013Naur form]], after two members of the Algol language design committee.<ref name=\"hu106\"/> The \"block structure\" aspect that context-free grammars capture is so fundamental to grammar that the terms syntax and grammar are often identified with context-free grammar rules, especially in computer science. Formal constraints not captured by the grammar are then considered to be part of the \"semantics\" of the language.\n\nContext-free grammars are simple enough to allow the construction of efficient [[list of algorithms#Parsing|parsing algorithm]]s that, for a given string, determine whether and how it can be generated from the grammar. An [[Earley parser]] is an example of such an algorithm, while the widely used [[LR parser|LR]] and [[LL parser]]s are simpler algorithms that deal only with more restrictive subsets of context-free grammars.\n\n== Formal definitions ==\nA context-free grammar {{mvar|G}} is defined by the 4-[[tuple]]:<ref>The notation here is that of {{harvtxt|Sipser|1997}}, p.&nbsp;94. {{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}} (p.&nbsp;79) define context-free grammars as 4-tuples in the same way, but with different variable names.</ref>\n\n<math>G = (V, \\Sigma, R, S)</math>\nwhere\n# {{mvar|V}} is a finite set; each element <math> v\\in V</math> is called ''a nonterminal character'' or a ''variable''. Each variable represents a different type of phrase or clause in the sentence. Variables are also sometimes called syntactic categories. Each variable defines a sub-language of the language defined by {{mvar|G}}.\n# {{math|\u03a3}} is a finite set of ''terminal''s, disjoint from {{mvar|V}}, which make up the actual content of the sentence. The set of terminals is the alphabet of the language defined by the grammar {{mvar|G}}.\n# {{mvar|R}} is a finite relation from {{mvar|V}} to <math>(V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math>, where the asterisk represents the [[Kleene star]] operation. The members of {{mvar|R}} are called the ''(rewrite) rule''s or ''production''s of the grammar. (also commonly symbolized by a {{mvar|P}})\n# {{mvar|S}} is the start variable (or start symbol), used to represent the whole sentence (or program). It must be an element of {{mvar|V}}.\n\n=== Production rule notation ===\nA [[Formal grammar#The syntax of grammars|production rule]] in {{mvar|R}} is formalized mathematically as a pair <math>(\\alpha, \\beta)\\in R</math>, where <math>\\alpha \\in V</math> is a nonterminal and <math>\\beta \\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math> is a [[string (computer science)|string]] of variables and/or terminals; rather than using [[ordered pair]] notation, production rules are usually written using an arrow operator with {{mvar|\u03b1}} as its left hand side and {{mvar|\u03b2}} as its right hand side:\n<math>\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta</math>.\n\nIt is allowed for {{mvar|\u03b2}} to be the [[empty string]], and in this case it is customary to denote it by \u03b5. The form <math>\\alpha\\rightarrow\\varepsilon</math> is called an {{mvar|\u03b5}}-production.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, pp. 90\u201392.</ref>\n\nIt is common to list all right-hand sides for the same left-hand side on the same line, using | (the [[pipe symbol]]) to separate them. Rules <math>\\alpha\\rightarrow \\beta_1</math> and <math>\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta_2</math> can hence be written as <math>\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta_1\\mid\\beta_2</math>. In this case, <math>\\beta_1</math> and <math>\\beta_2</math> is called the first and second alternative, respectively.\n\n=== Rule application ===\nFor any strings <math>u, v\\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math>, we say {{mvar|u}} directly yields {{mvar|v}}, written as <math>u\\Rightarrow v\\,</math>, if <math>\\exists (\\alpha, \\beta)\\in R</math> with <math>\\alpha \\in V</math> and <math>u_{1}, u_{2}\\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math> such that <math>u\\,=u_{1}\\alpha u_{2}</math> and <math>v\\,=u_{1}\\beta u_{2}</math>. Thus, {{mvar|v}} is a result of applying the rule <math>(\\alpha, \\beta)</math> to {{mvar|u}}.\n\n=== Repetitive rule application ===\nFor any strings <math>u, v\\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}, </math> we say {{mvar|u}} '''yields''' {{mvar|v}}, written as <math>u\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow} v</math> (or <math>u\\Rightarrow\\Rightarrow v\\,</math> in some textbooks), if <math>\\exists k\\geq 1\\, \\exists \\, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{k}\\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math> such that <math>u = \\, u_{1} \\Rightarrow u_{2} \\Rightarrow \\cdots \\Rightarrow u_{k} \\, = v</math>. In this case, if <math>k\\geq 2</math> (i.e., <math>u \\neq v</math>), the relation <math>u\\stackrel{+}{\\Rightarrow} v</math> holds. In other words, <math>(\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow})</math> and <math>(\\stackrel{+}{\\Rightarrow})</math> are the [[reflexive transitive closure]] (allowing a word to yield itself) and the [[transitive closure]] (requiring at least one step) of <math>(\\Rightarrow)</math>, respectively.\n\n=== Context-free language ===\nThe language of a grammar <math>G = (V, \\Sigma, R, S)</math> is the set\n:<math>L(G) = \\{ w\\in\\Sigma^{*} : S\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow} w\\}</math>\n\nA language {{mvar|L}} is said to be a context-free language (CFL), if there exists a CFG {{mvar|G}}, such that <math>L\\,=\\,L(G)</math>.\n\n[[Pushdown automaton#PDA and context-free languages|Non-deterministic pushdown automata]] recognize exactly the context-free languages.\n\n=== Proper CFGs ===\nA context-free grammar is said to be ''proper'',<ref>{{citation\n | last = Nijholt | first = Anton\n | isbn = 978-3-540-10245-8\n | mr = 590047\n | page = 8\n | publisher = Springer\n | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science\n | title = Context-free grammars: covers, normal forms, and parsing\n | volume = 93\n | year = 1980}}.</ref> if it has\n* no [[unreachable symbol]]s: <math>\\forall N \\in V: \\exists \\alpha,\\beta \\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^*: S \\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow} \\alpha{N}\\beta</math>\n* no [[unproductive symbol]]s: <math>\\forall N \\in V: \\exists w \\in \\Sigma^*: N \\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow} w</math>\n* no \u03b5-productions: <math>\\neg\\exists N \\in V: (N, \\varepsilon) \\in R</math>\n* no cycles: <math>\\neg\\exists N \\in V: N \\stackrel{+}{\\Rightarrow} N</math>\n\nEvery context-free grammar can be effectively transformed into a [[weak equivalence (formal languages)|weakly equivalent]] one without unreachable symbols,<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), p.88, Lemma 4.1</ref> a weakly equivalent one without unproductive symbols,<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), p.89, Lemma 4.2</ref> and a weakly equivalent one without cycles.<ref>This is a consequence of the unit-production elimination theorem in Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), p.91, Theorem 4.4</ref>\nEvery context-free grammar not producing \u03b5 can be effectively transformed into a weakly equivalent one without \u03b5-productions;<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), p.91, Theorem 4.4</ref> altogether, every such grammar can be effectively transformed into a weakly equivalent proper CFG.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== Words concatenated with their reverse ===\n\nThe grammar <math>G = (\\{S\\}, \\{a, b\\}, P, S)</math>, with productions\n\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ''aSa''}},\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ''bSb''}},\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 \u03b5}},\n\nis context-free. It is not proper since it includes an \u03b5-production. A typical derivation in this grammar is\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ''aSa'' \u2192 ''aaSaa'' \u2192 ''aabSbaa'' \u2192 ''aabbaa''}}.\nThis makes it clear that \n<math>L(G) = \\{ww^R:w\\in\\{a,b\\}^*\\}</math>. \nThe language is context-free, however, it can be proved that it is not [[Regular language|regular]].\n\nIf the productions\n\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ''a''}},\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ''b''}},\n\nare added, a context-free grammar for the set of all [[palindrome]]s over the alphabet {{math| { ''a'', ''b'' } }} is obtained.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, Exercise 4.1a, p.&nbsp;103.</ref>\n\n=== Well-formed parentheses ===\nThe canonical example of a context-free grammar is parenthesis matching, which is representative of the general case. There are two terminal symbols \"(\" and \")\" and one nonterminal symbol S. The production rules are\n\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ''SS''}},\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 (''S'')}},\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ()}}\n\nThe first rule allows the S symbol to multiply; the second rule allows the S symbol to become enclosed by matching parentheses; and the third rule terminates the recursion.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, Exercise 4.1b, p.&nbsp;103.</ref>\n\n=== Well-formed nested parentheses and square brackets ===\n\nA second canonical example is two different kinds of matching nested parentheses, described by the productions:\n\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''SS''}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ()}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 (''S'')}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 []}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 [''S'']}}\n\nwith terminal symbols [ ] ( ) and nonterminal S.\n\nThe following sequence can be derived in that grammar:\n:{{Math|([ [ [ ()() [ ][ ] ] ]([ ]) ])}}\n\n=== Matching pairs ===\nIn a context-free grammar, we can pair up characters the way we do with [[bracket]]s. The simplest example:\n\n:{{math|''S \u2192 aSb''}}\n:{{math|''S \u2192 ab''}}\n\nThis grammar generates the language <math> \\{ a^n b^n : n \\ge 1 \\} </math>, which is not [[regular language|regular]] (according to the [[pumping lemma for regular languages]]).\n\nThe special character \u03b5 stands for the empty string. By changing the above grammar to\n\n:{{math|''S \u2192 aSb''}}\n:{{math|''S \u2192 \u03b5''}}\n\nwe obtain a grammar generating the language <math> \\{ a^n b^n : n \\ge 0 \\} </math> instead. This differs only in that it contains the empty string while the original grammar did not.\n\n=== Distinct number of a's and b's ===\n\nA context-free grammar for the language consisting of all strings over {a,b} containing an unequal number of a's and b's:\n:{{math|''S \u2192 T &#124; U''}}\n:{{math|''T \u2192 VaT &#124; VaV &#124; TaV''}}\n:{{math|''U \u2192 VbU &#124; VbV &#124; UbV''}}\n:{{math|''V \u2192 aVbV &#124; bVaV &#124; \u03b5''}}\nHere, the nonterminal T can generate all strings with the same number of a's as b's, the nonterminal U generates all strings with more a's than b's and the nonterminal V generates all strings with fewer a's than b's. Omitting the third alternative in the rule for U and V doesn't restrict the grammar's language.\n\n=== Second block of b's of double size ===\n\nAnother example of a non-regular language is <math> \\{ \\text{b}^n \\text{a}^m \\text{b}^{2n} : n \\ge 0, m \\ge 0 \\} </math>. It is context-free as it can be generated by the following context-free grammar:\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''bSbb'' {{!}} ''A''}}\n:{{Math|''A'' \u2192 ''aA'' {{!}} ''\u03b5''}}\n\n=== First-order logic formulas ===\n\nThe [[First-order logic#Formation rules|formation rules]] for the terms and formulas of formal logic fit the definition of context-free grammar, except that the set of symbols may be infinite and there may be more than one start symbol.\n\n== Examples of languages that are not context free ==\n\nIn contrast to well-formed nested parentheses and square brackets in the previous section, there is no context-free grammar for generating all sequences of two different types of parentheses, each separately balanced ''disregarding the other'', where the two types need not nest inside one another, for example:\n\n:{{Math|[ ( ] )}}\n\nor\n\n:{{Math|[ [ [ [(((( ] ] ] ]))))(([ ))(([ ))([ )( ])( ])( ])}}\n\nThe fact that this language is not context free can be proven using [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages]] and a proof by contradiction, observing that all words of the form \n<math>\n{(}^n {[}^n {)}^n {]}^n\n</math>\nshould belong to the language. This language belongs instead to a more general class and can be described by a [[conjunctive grammar]], which in turn also includes other non-context-free languages, such as the language of all words of the form\n<math>\n\\text{a}^n \\text{b}^n \\text{c}^n\n</math>.\n\n== Regular grammars ==\n{{main|Regular grammar}}\nEvery [[regular grammar]] is context-free, but not all context-free grammars are regular.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aho |first1=Alfred Vaino |last2=Lam |first2=Monica S. |last3=Sethi |first3=Ravi |last4=Ullman |first4=Jeffrey David |authorlink1=Alfred Aho |authorlink2=Monica S.

For instance, one leftmost derivation of the same string is\n\n:{{Math|''S''}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + ''S''}} (by rule 2 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + 1 + ''S''}} (by rule 2 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + 1 + ''a''}} (by rule 3 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}}),\n\nwhich can be summarized as\n\n:rule 1\n:rule 2\n:rule 1\n:rule 2\n:rule 3.\n\nOne rightmost derivation is:\n\n:{{Math|''S''}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S'' + ''a''}} (by rule 3 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + 1 + ''a''}} (by rule 2 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + 1 + ''a''}} (by rule 2 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}}),\n\nwhich can be summarized as\n\n:rule 1\n:rule 1\n:rule 3\n:rule 2\n:rule 2.\n\nThe distinction between leftmost derivation and rightmost derivation is important because in most [[parsing|parser]]s the transformation of the input is defined by giving a piece of code for every grammar rule that is executed whenever the rule is applied. Therefore, it is important to know whether the parser determines a leftmost or a rightmost derivation because this determines the order in which the pieces of code will be executed. See for an example [[LL parser]]s and [[LR parser]]s.\n\nA derivation also imposes in some sense a hierarchical structure on the string that is derived. For example, if the string \"1 + 1 + a\" is derived according to the leftmost derivation outlined above, the structure of the string would be:\n\n:{{Math|&#123;&#123;1}<sub>''S''</sub> + &#123;&#123;1}<sub>''S''</sub> + {''a''}<sub>''S''</sub>}<sub>''S''</sub>}<sub>''S''</sub>}}\n\nwhere {{Math|{...}<sub>''S''</sub>}} indicates a substring recognized as belonging to {{Math|''S''}}. This hierarchy can also be seen as a tree:\n\n[[File:Simple Parse Tree 1.svg|x260px|Rightmost derivation of `1 + 1 + a`]]\n\nThis tree is called a ''[[parse tree]]'' or \"concrete syntax tree\" of the string, by contrast with the [[abstract syntax tree]]. In this case the presented leftmost and the rightmost derivations define the same parse tree; however, there is another rightmost derivation of the same string\n\n:{{Math|''S''}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''a''}} (by rule 3 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S'' + ''a''}} (by rule 1 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + 1 + ''a''}} (by rule 2 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + 1 + ''a''}} (by rule 2 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}}),\n\nwhich defines a string with a different structure\n\n:{{Math|&#123;&#123;&#123;1}<sub>''S''</sub> + {''a''}<sub>''S''</sub>}<sub>''S''</sub> + {''a''}<sub>''S''</sub>}<sub>''S''</sub>}}\n\nand a different parse parse tree:\n\n[[File:Simple Parse Tree 2.svg|x260px|Leftmost derivation of `1 + 1 + a`]]\n\nNote however that both parse trees can be obtained by both leftmost and rightmost derivations.  For example, the last tree can be obtained with the leftmost derivation as follows:\n\n:{{Math|''S''}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 2 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + 1 + ''S''}} (by rule 2 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + 1 + ''a''}} (by rule 3 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}}),\n\nIf a string in the language of the grammar has more than one parsing tree, then the grammar is said to be an ''[[ambiguous grammar]]''. Such grammars are usually hard to parse because the parser cannot always decide which grammar rule it has to apply. Usually, ambiguity is a feature of the grammar, not the language, and an unambiguous grammar can be found that generates the same context-free language. However, there are certain languages that can only be generated by ambiguous grammars; such languages are called ''[[inherently ambiguous language]]s''.\n\n=== Example: Algebraic expressions ===\nHere is a context-free grammar for syntactically correct [[Infix notation|infix]] algebraic expressions in the variables x, y and z:\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''x''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''y''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''z''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' + ''S''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' \u2013 ''S''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' * ''S''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' / ''S''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 (''S'')}}\n\nThis grammar can, for example, generate the string\n\n:{{Math|(''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''z'' * ''y'' / (''x'' + ''x'')}}\n\nas follows:\n\n:{{Math|''S''}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' \u2013 ''S''}} (by rule 5)\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' * ''S'' \u2013 ''S''}} (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / ''S''}} (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''S'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / ''S''}} (by rule 8, applied to the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''S'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / (''S'')}} (by rule 8, applied to the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''S'' + ''S'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / (''S'')}} (by rule 4, applied to the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''S'' + ''S'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' * ''S'' / (''S'')}} (by rule 6, applied to the fourth {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''S'' + ''S'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' * ''S'' / (''S'' + ''S'')}} (by rule 4, applied to the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''S'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' * ''S'' / (''S'' + ''S'')}} (etc.)\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''y'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' * ''S'' / (''S'' + ''S'')}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''S'' * ''S'' / (''S'' + ''S'')}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''z'' * ''S'' / (''S'' + ''S'')}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''z'' * ''y'' / (''S'' + ''S'')}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''z'' * ''y'' / (''x'' + ''S'')}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''z'' * ''y'' / (''x'' + ''x'')}}\n\nNote that many choices were made underway as to which rewrite was going to be performed next.\nThese choices look quite arbitrary. As a matter of fact, they are, in the sense that the string finally generated is always the same.  For example, the second and third rewrites\n\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' * ''S'' \u2013 ''S''}} (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / ''S''}} (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n\ncould be done in the opposite order:\n\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / ''S''}} (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / ''S''}} (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n\nAlso, many choices were made on which rule to apply to each selected {{Math|''S''}}.\nChanging the choices made and not only the order they were made in usually affects which terminal string comes out at the end.\n\nLet's look at this in more detail. Consider the [[parse tree]] of this derivation:\n\n[[File:Parse Tree 1.svg|An example parse tree]]\n\nStarting at the top, step by step, an S in the tree is expanded, until no more unexpanded {{Math|''S''}}es (nonterminals) remain.\nPicking a different order of expansion will produce a different derivation, but the same parse tree.\nThe parse tree will only change if we pick a different rule to apply at some position in the tree.\n\nBut can a different parse tree still produce the same terminal string,\nwhich is {{Math|(''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''z'' * ''y'' / (''x'' + ''x'')}} in this case?\nYes, for this particular grammar, this is possible.\nGrammars with this property are called [[ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]].\n\nFor example, {{Math|''x'' + ''y'' * ''z''}} can be produced with these two different parse trees:\n\n[[File:Parse Tree Derivations.svg|x260px|Two different parse trees from the same input]]\n\nHowever, the ''language'' described by this grammar is not inherently ambiguous:\nan alternative, unambiguous grammar can be given for the language, for example:\n\n:{{Math|''T'' \u2192 ''x''}}\n:{{Math|''T'' \u2192 ''y''}}\n:{{Math|''T'' \u2192 ''z''}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' + ''T''}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' \u2013 ''T''}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' * ''T''}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' / ''T''}}\n:{{Math|''T'' \u2192 (''S'')}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''T''}},\n\nonce again picking {{Math|''S''}} as the start symbol. This alternative grammar will produce {{Math|''x'' + ''y'' * ''z''}} with a parse tree similar to the left one above, i.e. implicitly assuming the association {{Math|(''x'' + ''y'') * ''z''}}, which is does not follow standard [[order of operations]]. More elaborate, unambiguous and context-free grammars can be constructed that produce parse trees that obey all desired [[Operator-precedence parser|operator precedence]] and associativity rules.\n\n== Normal forms ==\nEvery context-free grammar that does not generate the empty string can be transformed into one in which there is no \u03b5-production (that is, a rule that has the empty string as a product). If a grammar does generate the empty string, it will be necessary to include the rule {{Math|''S'' \u2192 \u03b5}}, but there need be no other \u03b5-rule. Every context-free grammar with no \u03b5-production has an equivalent grammar in [[Chomsky normal form]], and a grammar in [[Greibach normal form]]. \"Equivalent\" here means that the two grammars generate the same language.\n\nThe especially simple form of production rules in Chomsky normal form grammars has both theoretical and practical implications. For instance, given a context-free grammar, one can use the Chomsky normal form to construct a [[polynomial-time]] algorithm that decides whether a given string is in the language represented by that grammar or not (the [[CYK algorithm]]).\n\n==Closure properties==\nContext-free languages are [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the various operations, that is, if the languages ''K'' and ''L'' are \ncontext-free, so is the result of the following operations:\n\n* [[set union|union]] ''K'' \u222a ''L''; [[string concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]] ''K'' \u2218 ''L''; [[Kleene star]] ''L''<sup>*</sup><ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), p.131, Theorem 6.1</ref>\n* [[string substitution|substitution]] (in particular [[string homomorphism|homomorphism]])<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), pp.131\u2013132, Theorem 6.2</ref>\n* [[string homomorphism|inverse homomorphism]]<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), pp.132\u2013134, Theorem 6.3</ref>\n* [[set intersection|intersection]] with a [[regular language]]<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), pp.135\u2013136, Theorem 6.5</ref>\n\nThey are not closed under general intersection (hence neither under [[set complement|complementation]]) and set difference.<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), pp.134\u2013135, Theorem 6.4</ref>\n\n== Decidable problems ==\n\nThe following are some decidable problems about context-free grammars.\n\n=== Parsing ===\n\nThe parsing problem, checking whether a given word belongs to the language given by a context-free grammar, is decidable, using one of the general-purpose parsing algorithms:\n* [[CYK algorithm]] (for grammars in [[Chomsky normal form]])\n* [[Earley parser]]\n* [[GLR parser]]\n* [[LL parser]] (only for the proper subclass of for LL(''k'') grammars)\nContext-free parsing for [[Chomsky normal form]] grammars was shown by Leslie G.

Examples are:\n\n=== Universality ===\nGiven a CFG, does it generate the language of all strings over the alphabet of terminal symbols used in its rules?<ref name=\"sipser\">{{harvtxt|Sipser|1997}}, Theorem 5.10, p. 181.</ref><ref name=\"hu281\"/>\n\nA reduction can be demonstrated to this problem from the well-known undecidable problem of determining whether a [[Turing machine]] accepts a particular input (the [[halting problem]]). The reduction uses the concept of a ''[[computation history]]'', a string describing an entire computation of a [[Turing machine]]. A CFG can be constructed that generates all strings that are not accepting computation histories for a particular Turing machine on a particular input, and thus it will accept all strings only if the machine doesn't accept that input.\n\n=== Language equality ===\nGiven two CFGs, do they generate the same language?<ref name=\"hu281\">{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, p. 281.</ref><ref name=\"eom\"/>\n\nThe undecidability of this problem is a direct consequence of the previous: it is impossible to even decide whether a CFG is equivalent to the trivial CFG defining the language of all strings.\n\n=== Language inclusion ===\nGiven two CFGs, can the first one generate all strings that the second one can generate?<ref name=\"hu281\"/><ref name=\"eom\"/>\n\nIf this problem was decidable, then language equality could be decided too: two CFGs G1 and G2 generate the same language if L(G1) is a subset of L(G2) and L(G2) is a subset of L(G1).\n\n=== Being in a lower or higher level of the Chomsky hierarchy ===\nUsing [[Greibach's theorem]], it can be shown that the two following problems are undecidable:\n\n* Given a [[context-sensitive grammar]], does it describe a context-free language?\n* Given a context-free grammar, does it describe a [[regular language]]?<ref name=\"hu281\"/><ref name=\"eom\">{{citation|title=Encyclopaedia of mathematics: an updated and annotated translation of the Soviet \"Mathematical Encyclopaedia\"|first=Michiel|last=Hazewinkel|publisher=Springer|year=1994|isbn=978-1-55608-003-6|at=Vol. IV, p. 56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s9F71NJxwzoC&pg=PA56}}.</ref>\n\n=== Grammar ambiguity ===\nGiven a CFG, is it [[Ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]]?\n\nThe undecidability of this problem follows from the fact that if an algorithm to determine ambiguity existed, the [[Post correspondence problem]] could be decided, which is known to be undecidable.\n\n=== Language disjointness ===\nGiven two CFGs, is there any string derivable from both grammars?\n\nIf this problem was decidable, the undecidable [[Post correspondence problem]] could be decided, too: given strings <math>\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_N, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_N</math> over some alphabet <math>\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_k\\}</math>, let the grammar {{tmath|G_1}} consist of the rule\n:<math>S \\to \\alpha_1 S \\beta_1^{rev} | \\cdots | \\alpha_N S \\beta_N^{rev} | b</math>;\nwhere <math>\\beta_i^{rev}</math> denotes the [[String (computer science)#Reversal|reversed]] string <math>\\beta_i</math> and <math>b</math> doesn't occur among the <math>a_i</math>; and let grammar {{tmath|G_2}} consist of  the rule\n:<math>T \\to a_1 T a_1 | \\cdots | a_k T a_k | b</math>;\nThen the Post problem given by <math>\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_N, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_N</math> has a solution if and only if {{tmath|L(G_1)}} and {{tmath|L(G_2)}} share a derivable string.\n\n== Extensions ==\nAn obvious way to extend the context-free grammar formalism is to allow nonterminals to have arguments, the values of which are passed along within the rules. This allows natural language features such as [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] and [[reference]], and programming language analogs such as the correct use and definition of identifiers, to be expressed in a natural way. E.g. we can now easily express that in English sentences, the subject and verb must agree in number. In computer science, examples of this approach include [[affix grammar]]s, [[attribute grammar]]s, [[indexed grammar]]s, and Van Wijngaarden [[two-level grammar]]s. Similar extensions exist in linguistics.\n\nAn '''extended context-free grammar''' (or '''regular right part grammar''') is one in which the right-hand side of the production rules is allowed to be a [[regular expression]] over the grammar's terminals and nonterminals. Extended context-free grammars describe exactly the context-free languages.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Courses/fm/pub/context-free.pdf | title=A Short Introduction to Regular Expressions and Context-Free Grammars | accessdate=August 24, 2012 | author=Norvell, Theodore | pages=4}}</ref>\n\nAnother extension is to allow additional terminal symbols to appear at the left-hand side of rules, constraining their application. This produces the formalism of [[context-sensitive grammar]]s.\n\n== Subclasses ==\nThere are a number of important subclasses of the context-free grammars:\n\n* [[LR parser|LR(''k'')]] grammars (also known as [[deterministic context-free grammar]]s) allow [[parsing]] (string recognition) with [[deterministic pushdown automaton|deterministic pushdown automata]] (PDA), but they can only describe [[deterministic context-free language]]s.\n* [[SLR grammar|Simple LR]], [[LALR parser|Look-Ahead LR]] grammars are subclasses that allow further simplification of parsing. SLR and LALR are recognized using the same PDA as LR, but with simpler tables, in most cases.\n* [[LL parser|LL(''k'') and LL(''*'')]] grammars allow parsing by direct construction of a leftmost derivation as described above, and describe even fewer languages.\n* [[Simple grammar]]s are a subclass of the LL(1) grammars mostly interesting for its theoretical property that language equality of simple grammars is decidable, while language inclusion is not.\n* [[Bracketed grammar]]s have the property that the terminal symbols are divided into left and right bracket pairs that always match up in rules.\n* [[Linear grammar]]s have no rules with more than one nonterminal on the right-hand side.\n* [[Regular grammar]]s are a subclass of the linear grammars and describe the [[regular language|regular]] languages, i.e. they correspond to [[finite automaton|finite automata]] and [[regular expression]]s.\n\nLR parsing extends LL parsing to support a larger range of grammars; in turn, [[GLR parser|generalized LR parsing]] extends LR parsing to support arbitrary context-free grammars.  On LL grammars and LR grammars, it essentially performs LL parsing and LR parsing, respectively, while on [[nondeterministic grammar]]s, it is as efficient as can be expected.  Although GLR parsing was developed in the 1980s, many new language definitions and [[parser generator]]s continue to be based on LL, LALR or LR parsing up to the present day.\n\n== Linguistic applications ==\n[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] initially hoped to overcome the limitations of context-free grammars by adding [[transformational grammar|transformation rules]].<ref name=\"chomsky1956\"/>\n\nSuch rules are another standard device in traditional linguistics; e.g. [[grammatical voice|passivization]] in English. Much of [[generative grammar]] has been devoted to finding ways of refining the descriptive mechanisms of phrase-structure grammar and transformation rules such that exactly the kinds of things can be expressed that natural language actually allows. Allowing arbitrary transformations does not meet that goal: they are much too powerful, being [[Turing complete]] unless significant restrictions are added (e.g. no transformations that introduce and then rewrite symbols in a context-free fashion).\n\nChomsky's general position regarding the non-context-freeness of natural language has held up since then,<ref name=\"shieber1985\">{{citation | title=Evidence against the context-freeness of natural language | year=1985 | last=Shieber | first=Stuart | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=8 | pages=333\u2013343 | url=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~shieber/Biblio/Papers/shieber85.pdf | doi=10.1007/BF00630917 | issue=3}}.</ref> although his specific examples regarding the inadequacy of context-free grammars in terms of their weak generative capacity were later disproved.<ref name=\"pullum-gazdar1982\">{{citation | title=Natural languages and context-free languages | year=1982 | last=Pullum | first=Geoffrey K. | author2=Gerald Gazdar | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=4 | pages=471\u2013504 | doi=10.1007/BF00360802 | issue=4}}.</ref>\n[[Gerald Gazdar]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum]] have argued that despite a few non-context-free constructions in natural language (such as [[cross-serial dependencies]] in [[Swiss German]]<ref name=\"shieber1985\"/> and [[reduplication]] in [[Bambara language|Bambara]]<ref name=\"culy1985\">{{citation | title=The Complexity of the Vocabulary of Bambara | year=1985 | last=Culy | first=Christopher | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=8 | pages=345\u2013351 | doi=10.1007/BF00630918 | issue=3}}.</ref>), the vast majority of forms in natural language are indeed context-free.<ref name=\"pullum-gazdar1982\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Parsing expression grammar]]\n* [[Stochastic context-free grammar]]\n* [[Context-free grammar generation algorithms|Algorithms for context-free grammar generation]]\n* [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages]]\n* [[The RiTa Toolkit]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n<!--Group some notes as references-->\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation|first1=John E.|last1=Hopcroft|author1-link=John Hopcroft|first2=Jeffrey D.|last2=Ullman|author2-link=Jeffrey Ullman|title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1979}}.

Nonterminal and terminal symbols are shown in blue and red, respectively.]]\nIn [[formal language]] theory, a '''context-free grammar''' ('''CFG''') is a [[formal grammar]] in which every [[Production (computer science)|production rule]] is of the form\n\n:<math>A\\ \\to\\ \\alpha</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is a ''single'' [[nonterminal]] symbol, and <math>\\alpha</math> is a string of [[Terminal and nonterminal symbols|terminal]]s and/or nonterminals (<math>\\alpha</math> can be empty). A formal grammar is considered \"context free\" when its production rules can be applied regardless of the context of a nonterminal. No matter which symbols surround it, the single nonterminal on the left hand side can always be replaced by the right hand side. This is what distinguishes it from a [[context-sensitive grammar]].\n\nA formal grammar is essentially a set of production rules that describe all possible strings in a given formal language. Production rules are simple replacements. For example, the first rule in the picture,\n\n:<math>\\langle\\text{Stmt}\\rangle \\to \\langle\\text{Id}\\rangle = \\langle\\text{Expr}\\rangle ;</math>\n\nreplaces <math>\\langle\\text{Stmt}\\rangle</math> with <math>\\langle\\text{Id}\\rangle = \\langle\\text{Expr}\\rangle ;</math>. There can be multiple replacement rules for a given nonterminal symbol. The language generated by a grammar is the set of all strings of terminal symbols that can be derived, by repeated rule applications, from some particular nonterminal symbol (\"start symbol\").\nNonterminal symbols are used during the derivation process, but may not appear in its final result string. \n\n[[formal language|Language]]s generated by context-free grammars are known as [[context-free language]]s (CFL). Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. It is important to distinguish the properties of the language (intrinsic properties) from the properties of a particular grammar (extrinsic properties). The [[#Language equality|language equality]] question (do two given context-free grammars generate the same language?) is [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]].\n\nContext-free grammars arise in [[linguistics]] where they are used to describe the structure of sentences and words in a [[natural language]], and they were in fact invented by the linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] for this purpose. By contrast, in [[computer science]], as the use of recursively-defined concepts increased, they were used more and more. In an early application, grammars are used to describe the structure of [[programming language]]s. In a newer application, they are used in an essential part of the [[Extensible Markup Language]] (XML) called the ''[[Document Type Definition]]''.<ref>''Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation'', John E. Hopcroft, Rajeev Motwani, Jeffrey D. Ullman, Addison Wesley, 2001, p.191</ref>\n\nIn [[linguistics]], some authors use the term '''[[phrase structure grammar]]''' to refer to context-free grammars, whereby phrase-structure grammars are distinct from [[dependency grammar]]s. In [[computer science]], a popular notation for context-free grammars is [[Backus\u2013Naur form]], or ''BNF''.\n\n== Background ==\n\nSince the time of [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]], at least, linguists have described the [[grammar]]s of languages in terms of their block structure, and described how sentences are [[recursion|recursively]] built up from smaller phrases, and eventually individual words or word elements. An essential property of these block structures is that logical units never overlap. For example, the sentence:\n: ''John, whose blue car was in the garage, walked to the grocery store.''\ncan be logically parenthesized (with the logical metasymbols '''[ ]''') as follows:\n: '''['''''John'''''[''', '''['''''whose '''''['''''blue car''''']]''' '''['''''was '''''['''''in '''''['''''the garage''''']]]''',''']]''' '''['''''walked '''''['''''to '''''['''''the '''''['''''grocery store''''']]]]'''.\nA context-free grammar provides a simple and mathematically precise mechanism for describing the methods by which phrases in some natural language are built from smaller blocks, capturing the \"block structure\" of sentences in a natural way. Its simplicity makes the formalism amenable to rigorous mathematical study. Important features of natural language syntax such as [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] and [[reference]] are not part of the context-free grammar, but the basic recursive structure of sentences, the way in which clauses nest inside other clauses, and the way in which lists of adjectives and adverbs are swallowed by nouns and verbs, is described exactly.\n\nContext-free grammars are a special form of [[Semi-Thue system]]s that in their general form date back to the work of [[Axel Thue]].\n\nThe formalism of context-free grammars was developed in the mid-1950s by [[Noam Chomsky]],<ref name=\"hu106\">{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, p.&nbsp;106.</ref> and also their [[Chomsky hierarchy|classification as a special type]] of [[formal grammar]] (which he called [[phrase-structure grammar]]s).<ref name=\"chomsky1956\">{{citation\n | last = Chomsky | first = Noam | authorlink =\n | title = Three models for the description of language\n | journal = IEEE Transactions on Information Theory\n | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 113\u2013124\n | date = Sep 1956\n | doi = 10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813| id = }}</ref> What Chomsky called a phrase structure grammar is also known now as a constituency grammar, whereby constituency grammars stand in contrast to [[dependency grammar]]s. In Chomsky's [[generative grammar]] framework, the syntax of natural language was described by context-free rules combined with transformation rules.\n\nBlock structure was introduced into computer [[programming language]]s by the [[Algol (programming language)|Algol]] project (1957\u20131960), which, as a consequence, also featured a context-free grammar to describe the resulting Algol syntax. This became a standard feature of computer languages, and the notation for grammars used in concrete descriptions of computer languages came to be known as [[Backus\u2013Naur form]], after two members of the Algol language design committee.<ref name=\"hu106\"/> The \"block structure\" aspect that context-free grammars capture is so fundamental to grammar that the terms syntax and grammar are often identified with context-free grammar rules, especially in computer science. Formal constraints not captured by the grammar are then considered to be part of the \"semantics\" of the language.\n\nContext-free grammars are simple enough to allow the construction of efficient [[list of algorithms#Parsing|parsing algorithm]]s that, for a given string, determine whether and how it can be generated from the grammar. An [[Earley parser]] is an example of such an algorithm, while the widely used [[LR parser|LR]] and [[LL parser]]s are simpler algorithms that deal only with more restrictive subsets of context-free grammars.\n\n== Formal definitions ==\nA context-free grammar {{mvar|G}} is defined by the 4-[[tuple]]:<ref>The notation here is that of {{harvtxt|Sipser|1997}}, p.&nbsp;94. {{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}} (p.&nbsp;79) define context-free grammars as 4-tuples in the same way, but with different variable names.</ref>\n\n<math>G = (V, \\Sigma, R, S)</math>\nwhere\n# {{mvar|V}} is a finite set; each element <math> v\\in V</math> is called ''a nonterminal character'' or a ''variable''. Each variable represents a different type of phrase or clause in the sentence. Variables are also sometimes called syntactic categories. Each variable defines a sub-language of the language defined by {{mvar|G}}.\n# {{math|\u03a3}} is a finite set of ''terminal''s, disjoint from {{mvar|V}}, which make up the actual content of the sentence. The set of terminals is the alphabet of the language defined by the grammar {{mvar|G}}.\n# {{mvar|R}} is a finite relation from {{mvar|V}} to <math>(V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math>, where the asterisk represents the [[Kleene star]] operation. The members of {{mvar|R}} are called the ''(rewrite) rule''s or ''production''s of the grammar. (also commonly symbolized by a {{mvar|P}})\n# {{mvar|S}} is the start variable (or start symbol), used to represent the whole sentence (or program). It must be an element of {{mvar|V}}.\n\n=== Production rule notation ===\nA [[Formal grammar#The syntax of grammars|production rule]] in {{mvar|R}} is formalized mathematically as a pair <math>(\\alpha, \\beta)\\in R</math>, where <math>\\alpha \\in V</math> is a nonterminal and <math>\\beta \\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math> is a [[string (computer science)|string]] of variables and/or terminals; rather than using [[ordered pair]] notation, production rules are usually written using an arrow operator with {{mvar|\u03b1}} as its left hand side and {{mvar|\u03b2}} as its right hand side:\n<math>\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta</math>.\n\nIt is allowed for {{mvar|\u03b2}} to be the [[empty string]], and in this case it is customary to denote it by \u03b5. The form <math>\\alpha\\rightarrow\\varepsilon</math> is called an {{mvar|\u03b5}}-production.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, pp. 90\u201392.</ref>\n\nIt is common to list all right-hand sides for the same left-hand side on the same line, using | (the [[pipe symbol]]) to separate them. Rules <math>\\alpha\\rightarrow \\beta_1</math> and <math>\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta_2</math> can hence be written as <math>\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta_1\\mid\\beta_2</math>. In this case, <math>\\beta_1</math> and <math>\\beta_2</math> is called the first and second alternative, respectively.\n\n=== Rule application ===\nFor any strings <math>u, v\\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math>, we say {{mvar|u}} directly yields {{mvar|v}}, written as <math>u\\Rightarrow v\\,</math>, if <math>\\exists (\\alpha, \\beta)\\in R</math> with <math>\\alpha \\in V</math> and <math>u_{1}, u_{2}\\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math> such that <math>u\\,=u_{1}\\alpha u_{2}</math> and <math>v\\,=u_{1}\\beta u_{2}</math>. Thus, {{mvar|v}} is a result of applying the rule <math>(\\alpha, \\beta)</math> to {{mvar|u}}.\n\n=== Repetitive rule application ===\nFor any strings <math>u, v\\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}, </math> we say {{mvar|u}} '''yields''' {{mvar|v}}, written as <math>u\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow} v</math> (or <math>u\\Rightarrow\\Rightarrow v\\,</math> in some textbooks), if <math>\\exists k\\geq 1\\, \\exists \\, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{k}\\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math> such that <math>u = \\, u_{1} \\Rightarrow u_{2} \\Rightarrow \\cdots \\Rightarrow u_{k} \\, = v</math>. In this case, if <math>k\\geq 2</math> (i.e., <math>u \\neq v</math>), the relation <math>u\\stackrel{+}{\\Rightarrow} v</math> holds. In other words, <math>(\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow})</math> and <math>(\\stackrel{+}{\\Rightarrow})</math> are the [[reflexive transitive closure]] (allowing a word to yield itself) and the [[transitive closure]] (requiring at least one step) of <math>(\\Rightarrow)</math>, respectively.\n\n=== Context-free language ===\nThe language of a grammar <math>G = (V, \\Sigma, R, S)</math> is the set\n:<math>L(G) = \\{ w\\in\\Sigma^{*} : S\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow} w\\}</math>\n\nA language {{mvar|L}} is said to be a context-free language (CFL), if there exists a CFG {{mvar|G}}, such that <math>L\\,=\\,L(G)</math>.\n\n[[Pushdown automaton#PDA and context-free languages|Non-deterministic pushdown automata]] recognize exactly the context-free languages.\n\n=== Proper CFGs ===\nA context-free grammar is said to be ''proper'',<ref>{{citation\n | last = Nijholt | first = Anton\n | isbn = 978-3-540-10245-8\n | mr = 590047\n | page = 8\n | publisher = Springer\n | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science\n | title = Context-free grammars: covers, normal forms, and parsing\n | volume = 93\n | year = 1980}}.</ref> if it has\n* no [[unreachable symbol]]s: <math>\\forall N \\in V: \\exists \\alpha,\\beta \\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^*: S \\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow} \\alpha{N}\\beta</math>\n* no [[unproductive symbol]]s: <math>\\forall N \\in V: \\exists w \\in \\Sigma^*: N \\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow} w</math>\n* no \u03b5-productions: <math>\\neg\\exists N \\in V: (N, \\varepsilon) \\in R</math>\n* no cycles: <math>\\neg\\exists N \\in V: N \\stackrel{+}{\\Rightarrow} N</math>\n\nEvery context-free grammar can be effectively transformed into a [[weak equivalence (formal languages)|weakly equivalent]] one without unreachable symbols,<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), p.88, Lemma 4.1</ref> a weakly equivalent one without unproductive symbols,<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), p.89, Lemma 4.2</ref> and a weakly equivalent one without cycles.<ref>This is a consequence of the unit-production elimination theorem in Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), p.91, Theorem 4.4</ref>\nEvery context-free grammar not producing \u03b5 can be effectively transformed into a weakly equivalent one without \u03b5-productions;<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), p.91, Theorem 4.4</ref> altogether, every such grammar can be effectively transformed into a weakly equivalent proper CFG.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== Words concatenated with their reverse ===\n\nThe grammar <math>G = (\\{S\\}, \\{a, b\\}, P, S)</math>, with productions\n\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ''aSa''}},\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ''bSb''}},\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 \u03b5}},\n\nis context-free. It is not proper since it includes an \u03b5-production. A typical derivation in this grammar is\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ''aSa'' \u2192 ''aaSaa'' \u2192 ''aabSbaa'' \u2192 ''aabbaa''}}.\nThis makes it clear that \n<math>L(G) = \\{ww^R:w\\in\\{a,b\\}^*\\}</math>. \nThe language is context-free, however, it can be proved that it is not [[Regular language|regular]].\n\nIf the productions\n\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ''a''}},\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ''b''}},\n\nare added, a context-free grammar for the set of all [[palindrome]]s over the alphabet {{math| { ''a'', ''b'' } }} is obtained.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, Exercise 4.1a, p.&nbsp;103.</ref>\n\n=== Well-formed parentheses ===\nThe canonical example of a context-free grammar is parenthesis matching, which is representative of the general case. There are two terminal symbols \"(\" and \")\" and one nonterminal symbol S. The production rules are\n\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ''SS''}},\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 (''S'')}},\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ()}}\n\nThe first rule allows the S symbol to multiply; the second rule allows the S symbol to become enclosed by matching parentheses; and the third rule terminates the recursion.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, Exercise 4.1b, p.&nbsp;103.</ref>\n\n=== Well-formed nested parentheses and square brackets ===\n\nA second canonical example is two different kinds of matching nested parentheses, described by the productions:\n\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''SS''}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ()}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 (''S'')}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 []}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 [''S'']}}\n\nwith terminal symbols [ ] ( ) and nonterminal S.\n\nThe following sequence can be derived in that grammar:\n:{{Math|([ [ [ ()() [ ][ ] ] ]([ ]) ])}}\n\n=== Matching pairs ===\nIn a context-free grammar, we can pair up characters the way we do with [[bracket]]s. The simplest example:\n\n:{{math|''S \u2192 aSb''}}\n:{{math|''S \u2192 ab''}}\n\nThis grammar generates the language <math> \\{ a^n b^n : n \\ge 1 \\} </math>, which is not [[regular language|regular]] (according to the [[pumping lemma for regular languages]]).\n\nThe special character \u03b5 stands for the empty string. By changing the above grammar to\n\n:{{math|''S \u2192 aSb''}}\n:{{math|''S \u2192 \u03b5''}}\n\nwe obtain a grammar generating the language <math> \\{ a^n b^n : n \\ge 0 \\} </math> instead. This differs only in that it contains the empty string while the original grammar did not.\n\n=== Distinct number of a's and b's ===\n\nA context-free grammar for the language consisting of all strings over {a,b} containing an unequal number of a's and b's:\n:{{math|''S \u2192 T &#124; U''}}\n:{{math|''T \u2192 VaT &#124; VaV &#124; TaV''}}\n:{{math|''U \u2192 VbU &#124; VbV &#124; UbV''}}\n:{{math|''V \u2192 aVbV &#124; bVaV &#124; \u03b5''}}\nHere, the nonterminal T can generate all strings with the same number of a's as b's, the nonterminal U generates all strings with more a's than b's and the nonterminal V generates all strings with fewer a's than b's. Omitting the third alternative in the rule for U and V doesn't restrict the grammar's language.\n\n=== Second block of b's of double size ===\n\nAnother example of a non-regular language is <math> \\{ \\text{b}^n \\text{a}^m \\text{b}^{2n} : n \\ge 0, m \\ge 0 \\} </math>. It is context-free as it can be generated by the following context-free grammar:\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''bSbb'' {{!}} ''A''}}\n:{{Math|''A'' \u2192 ''aA'' {{!}} ''\u03b5''}}\n\n=== First-order logic formulas ===\n\nThe [[First-order logic#Formation rules|formation rules]] for the terms and formulas of formal logic fit the definition of context-free grammar, except that the set of symbols may be infinite and there may be more than one start symbol.\n\n== Examples of languages that are not context free ==\n\nIn contrast to well-formed nested parentheses and square brackets in the previous section, there is no context-free grammar for generating all sequences of two different types of parentheses, each separately balanced ''disregarding the other'', where the two types need not nest inside one another, for example:\n\n:{{Math|[ ( ] )}}\n\nor\n\n:{{Math|[ [ [ [(((( ] ] ] ]))))(([ ))(([ ))([ )( ])( ])( ])}}\n\nThe fact that this language is not context free can be proven using [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages]] and a proof by contradiction, observing that all words of the form \n<math>\n{(}^n {[}^n {)}^n {]}^n\n</math>\nshould belong to the language. This language belongs instead to a more general class and can be described by a [[conjunctive grammar]], which in turn also includes other non-context-free languages, such as the language of all words of the form\n<math>\n\\text{a}^n \\text{b}^n \\text{c}^n\n</math>.\n\n== Regular grammars ==\n{{main|Regular grammar}}\nEvery [[regular grammar]] is context-free, but not all context-free grammars are regular.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aho |first1=Alfred Vaino |last2=Lam |first2=Monica S. |last3=Sethi |first3=Ravi |last4=Ullman |first4=Jeffrey David |authorlink1=Alfred Aho |authorlink2=Monica S.

For instance, one leftmost derivation of the same string is\n\n:{{Math|''S''}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + ''S''}} (by rule 2 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + 1 + ''S''}} (by rule 2 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + 1 + ''a''}} (by rule 3 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}}),\n\nwhich can be summarized as\n\n:rule 1\n:rule 2\n:rule 1\n:rule 2\n:rule 3.\n\nOne rightmost derivation is:\n\n:{{Math|''S''}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S'' + ''a''}} (by rule 3 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + 1 + ''a''}} (by rule 2 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + 1 + ''a''}} (by rule 2 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}}),\n\nwhich can be summarized as\n\n:rule 1\n:rule 1\n:rule 3\n:rule 2\n:rule 2.\n\nThe distinction between leftmost derivation and rightmost derivation is important because in most [[parsing|parser]]s the transformation of the input is defined by giving a piece of code for every grammar rule that is executed whenever the rule is applied. Therefore, it is important to know whether the parser determines a leftmost or a rightmost derivation because this determines the order in which the pieces of code will be executed. See for an example [[LL parser]]s and [[LR parser]]s.\n\nA derivation also imposes in some sense a hierarchical structure on the string that is derived. For example, if the string \"1 + 1 + a\" is derived according to the leftmost derivation outlined above, the structure of the string would be:\n\n:{{Math|&#123;&#123;1}<sub>''S''</sub> + &#123;&#123;1}<sub>''S''</sub> + {''a''}<sub>''S''</sub>}<sub>''S''</sub>}<sub>''S''</sub>}}\n\nwhere {{Math|{...}<sub>''S''</sub>}} indicates a substring recognized as belonging to {{Math|''S''}}. This hierarchy can also be seen as a tree:\n\n[[File:Simple Parse Tree 1.svg|x260px|Rightmost derivation of `1 + 1 + a`]]\n\nThis tree is called a ''[[parse tree]]'' or \"concrete syntax tree\" of the string, by contrast with the [[abstract syntax tree]]. In this case the presented leftmost and the rightmost derivations define the same parse tree; however, there is another rightmost derivation of the same string\n\n:{{Math|''S''}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''a''}} (by rule 3 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S'' + ''a''}} (by rule 1 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + 1 + ''a''}} (by rule 2 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + 1 + ''a''}} (by rule 2 on the rightmost {{Math|''S''}}),\n\nwhich defines a string with a different structure\n\n:{{Math|&#123;&#123;&#123;1}<sub>''S''</sub> + {''a''}<sub>''S''</sub>}<sub>''S''</sub> + {''a''}<sub>''S''</sub>}<sub>''S''</sub>}}\n\nand a different parse parse tree:\n\n[[File:Simple Parse Tree 2.svg|x260px|Leftmost derivation of `1 + 1 + a`]]\n\nNote however that both parse trees can be obtained by both leftmost and rightmost derivations.  For example, the last tree can be obtained with the leftmost derivation as follows:\n\n:{{Math|''S''}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' + ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 1 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + ''S'' + ''S''}} (by rule 2 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + 1 + ''S''}} (by rule 2 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 1 + 1 + ''a''}} (by rule 3 on the leftmost {{Math|''S''}}),\n\nIf a string in the language of the grammar has more than one parsing tree, then the grammar is said to be an ''[[ambiguous grammar]]''. Such grammars are usually hard to parse because the parser cannot always decide which grammar rule it has to apply. Usually, ambiguity is a feature of the grammar, not the language, and an unambiguous grammar can be found that generates the same context-free language. However, there are certain languages that can only be generated by ambiguous grammars; such languages are called ''[[inherently ambiguous language]]s''.\n\n=== Example: Algebraic expressions ===\nHere is a context-free grammar for syntactically correct [[Infix notation|infix]] algebraic expressions in the variables x, y and z:\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''x''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''y''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''z''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' + ''S''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' \u2013 ''S''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' * ''S''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' / ''S''}}\n#{{Math|''S'' \u2192 (''S'')}}\n\nThis grammar can, for example, generate the string\n\n:{{Math|(''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''z'' * ''y'' / (''x'' + ''x'')}}\n\nas follows:\n\n:{{Math|''S''}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' \u2013 ''S''}} (by rule 5)\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' * ''S'' \u2013 ''S''}} (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / ''S''}} (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''S'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / ''S''}} (by rule 8, applied to the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''S'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / (''S'')}} (by rule 8, applied to the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''S'' + ''S'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / (''S'')}} (by rule 4, applied to the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''S'' + ''S'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' * ''S'' / (''S'')}} (by rule 6, applied to the fourth {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''S'' + ''S'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' * ''S'' / (''S'' + ''S'')}} (by rule 4, applied to the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''S'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' * ''S'' / (''S'' + ''S'')}} (etc.)\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''y'') * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' * ''S'' / (''S'' + ''S'')}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''S'' * ''S'' / (''S'' + ''S'')}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''z'' * ''S'' / (''S'' + ''S'')}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''z'' * ''y'' / (''S'' + ''S'')}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''z'' * ''y'' / (''x'' + ''S'')}}\n:{{Math|\u2192 (''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''z'' * ''y'' / (''x'' + ''x'')}}\n\nNote that many choices were made underway as to which rewrite was going to be performed next.\nThese choices look quite arbitrary. As a matter of fact, they are, in the sense that the string finally generated is always the same.  For example, the second and third rewrites\n\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' * ''S'' \u2013 ''S''}} (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / ''S''}} (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n\ncould be done in the opposite order:\n\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / ''S''}} (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost {{Math|''S''}})\n:{{Math|\u2192 ''S'' * ''S'' \u2013 ''S'' / ''S''}} (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost {{Math|''S''}})\n\nAlso, many choices were made on which rule to apply to each selected {{Math|''S''}}.\nChanging the choices made and not only the order they were made in usually affects which terminal string comes out at the end.\n\nLet's look at this in more detail. Consider the [[parse tree]] of this derivation:\n\n[[File:Parse Tree 1.svg|An example parse tree]]\n\nStarting at the top, step by step, an S in the tree is expanded, until no more unexpanded {{Math|''S''}}es (nonterminals) remain.\nPicking a different order of expansion will produce a different derivation, but the same parse tree.\nThe parse tree will only change if we pick a different rule to apply at some position in the tree.\n\nBut can a different parse tree still produce the same terminal string,\nwhich is {{Math|(''x'' + ''y'') * ''x'' \u2013 ''z'' * ''y'' / (''x'' + ''x'')}} in this case?\nYes, for this particular grammar, this is possible.\nGrammars with this property are called [[ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]].\n\nFor example, {{Math|''x'' + ''y'' * ''z''}} can be produced with these two different parse trees:\n\n[[File:Parse Tree Derivations.svg|x260px|Two different parse trees from the same input]]\n\nHowever, the ''language'' described by this grammar is not inherently ambiguous:\nan alternative, unambiguous grammar can be given for the language, for example:\n\n:{{Math|''T'' \u2192 ''x''}}\n:{{Math|''T'' \u2192 ''y''}}\n:{{Math|''T'' \u2192 ''z''}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' + ''T''}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' \u2013 ''T''}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' * ''T''}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''S'' / ''T''}}\n:{{Math|''T'' \u2192 (''S'')}}\n:{{Math|''S'' \u2192 ''T''}},\n\nonce again picking {{Math|''S''}} as the start symbol. This alternative grammar will produce {{Math|''x'' + ''y'' * ''z''}} with a parse tree similar to the left one above, i.e. implicitly assuming the association {{Math|(''x'' + ''y'') * ''z''}}, which is does not follow standard [[order of operations]]. More elaborate, unambiguous and context-free grammars can be constructed that produce parse trees that obey all desired [[Operator-precedence parser|operator precedence]] and associativity rules.\n\n== Normal forms ==\nEvery context-free grammar that does not generate the empty string can be transformed into one in which there is no \u03b5-production (that is, a rule that has the empty string as a product). If a grammar does generate the empty string, it will be necessary to include the rule {{Math|''S'' \u2192 \u03b5}}, but there need be no other \u03b5-rule. Every context-free grammar with no \u03b5-production has an equivalent grammar in [[Chomsky normal form]], and a grammar in [[Greibach normal form]]. \"Equivalent\" here means that the two grammars generate the same language.\n\nThe especially simple form of production rules in Chomsky normal form grammars has both theoretical and practical implications. For instance, given a context-free grammar, one can use the Chomsky normal form to construct a [[polynomial-time]] algorithm that decides whether a given string is in the language represented by that grammar or not (the [[CYK algorithm]]).\n\n==Closure properties==\nContext-free languages are [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the various operations, that is, if the languages ''K'' and ''L'' are \ncontext-free, so is the result of the following operations:\n\n* [[set union|union]] ''K'' \u222a ''L''; [[string concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]] ''K'' \u2218 ''L''; [[Kleene star]] ''L''<sup>*</sup><ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), p.131, Theorem 6.1</ref>\n* [[string substitution|substitution]] (in particular [[string homomorphism|homomorphism]])<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), pp.131\u2013132, Theorem 6.2</ref>\n* [[string homomorphism|inverse homomorphism]]<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), pp.132\u2013134, Theorem 6.3</ref>\n* [[set intersection|intersection]] with a [[regular language]]<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), pp.135\u2013136, Theorem 6.5</ref>\n\nThey are not closed under general intersection (hence neither under [[set complement|complementation]]) and set difference.<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), pp.134\u2013135, Theorem 6.4</ref>\n\n== Decidable problems ==\n\nThe following are some decidable problems about context-free grammars.\n\n=== Parsing ===\n\nThe parsing problem, checking whether a given word belongs to the language given by a context-free grammar, is decidable, using one of the general-purpose parsing algorithms:\n* [[CYK algorithm]] (for grammars in [[Chomsky normal form]])\n* [[Earley parser]]\n* [[GLR parser]]\n* [[LL parser]] (only for the proper subclass of for LL(''k'') grammars)\nContext-free parsing for [[Chomsky normal form]] grammars was shown by Leslie G.

Examples are:\n\n=== Universality ===\nGiven a CFG, does it generate the language of all strings over the alphabet of terminal symbols used in its rules?<ref name=\"sipser\">{{harvtxt|Sipser|1997}}, Theorem 5.10, p. 181.</ref><ref name=\"hu281\"/>\n\nA reduction can be demonstrated to this problem from the well-known undecidable problem of determining whether a [[Turing machine]] accepts a particular input (the [[halting problem]]). The reduction uses the concept of a ''[[computation history]]'', a string describing an entire computation of a [[Turing machine]]. A CFG can be constructed that generates all strings that are not accepting computation histories for a particular Turing machine on a particular input, and thus it will accept all strings only if the machine doesn't accept that input.\n\n=== Language equality ===\nGiven two CFGs, do they generate the same language?<ref name=\"hu281\">{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, p. 281.</ref><ref name=\"eom\"/>\n\nThe undecidability of this problem is a direct consequence of the previous: it is impossible to even decide whether a CFG is equivalent to the trivial CFG defining the language of all strings.\n\n=== Language inclusion ===\nGiven two CFGs, can the first one generate all strings that the second one can generate?<ref name=\"hu281\"/><ref name=\"eom\"/>\n\nIf this problem was decidable, then language equality could be decided too: two CFGs G1 and G2 generate the same language if L(G1) is a subset of L(G2) and L(G2) is a subset of L(G1).\n\n=== Being in a lower or higher level of the Chomsky hierarchy ===\nUsing [[Greibach's theorem]], it can be shown that the two following problems are undecidable:\n\n* Given a [[context-sensitive grammar]], does it describe a context-free language?\n* Given a context-free grammar, does it describe a [[regular language]]?<ref name=\"hu281\"/><ref name=\"eom\">{{citation|title=Encyclopaedia of mathematics: an updated and annotated translation of the Soviet \"Mathematical Encyclopaedia\"|first=Michiel|last=Hazewinkel|publisher=Springer|year=1994|isbn=978-1-55608-003-6|at=Vol. IV, p. 56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s9F71NJxwzoC&pg=PA56}}.</ref>\n\n=== Grammar ambiguity ===\nGiven a CFG, is it [[Ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]]?\n\nThe undecidability of this problem follows from the fact that if an algorithm to determine ambiguity existed, the [[Post correspondence problem]] could be decided, which is known to be undecidable.\n\n=== Language disjointness ===\nGiven two CFGs, is there any string derivable from both grammars?\n\nIf this problem was decidable, the undecidable [[Post correspondence problem]] could be decided, too: given strings <math>\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_N, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_N</math> over some alphabet <math>\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_k\\}</math>, let the grammar {{tmath|G_1}} consist of the rule\n:<math>S \\to \\alpha_1 S \\beta_1^{rev} | \\cdots | \\alpha_N S \\beta_N^{rev} | b</math>;\nwhere <math>\\beta_i^{rev}</math> denotes the [[String (computer science)#Reversal|reversed]] string <math>\\beta_i</math> and <math>b</math> doesn't occur among the <math>a_i</math>; and let grammar {{tmath|G_2}} consist of  the rule\n:<math>T \\to a_1 T a_1 | \\cdots | a_k T a_k | b</math>;\nThen the Post problem given by <math>\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_N, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_N</math> has a solution if and only if {{tmath|L(G_1)}} and {{tmath|L(G_2)}} share a derivable string.\n\n== Extensions ==\nAn obvious way to extend the context-free grammar formalism is to allow nonterminals to have arguments, the values of which are passed along within the rules. This allows natural language features such as [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] and [[reference]], and programming language analogs such as the correct use and definition of identifiers, to be expressed in a natural way. E.g. we can now easily express that in English sentences, the subject and verb must agree in number. In computer science, examples of this approach include [[affix grammar]]s, [[attribute grammar]]s, [[indexed grammar]]s, and Van Wijngaarden [[two-level grammar]]s. Similar extensions exist in linguistics.\n\nAn '''extended context-free grammar''' (or '''regular right part grammar''') is one in which the right-hand side of the production rules is allowed to be a [[regular expression]] over the grammar's terminals and nonterminals. Extended context-free grammars describe exactly the context-free languages.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Courses/fm/pub/context-free.pdf | title=A Short Introduction to Regular Expressions and Context-Free Grammars | accessdate=August 24, 2012 | author=Norvell, Theodore | pages=4}}</ref>\n\nAnother extension is to allow additional terminal symbols to appear at the left-hand side of rules, constraining their application. This produces the formalism of [[context-sensitive grammar]]s.\n\n== Subclasses ==\nThere are a number of important subclasses of the context-free grammars:\n\n* [[LR parser|LR(''k'')]] grammars (also known as [[deterministic context-free grammar]]s) allow [[parsing]] (string recognition) with [[deterministic pushdown automaton|deterministic pushdown automata]] (PDA), but they can only describe [[deterministic context-free language]]s.\n* [[SLR grammar|Simple LR]], [[LALR parser|Look-Ahead LR]] grammars are subclasses that allow further simplification of parsing. SLR and LALR are recognized using the same PDA as LR, but with simpler tables, in most cases.\n* [[LL parser|LL(''k'') and LL(''*'')]] grammars allow parsing by direct construction of a leftmost derivation as described above, and describe even fewer languages.\n* [[Simple grammar]]s are a subclass of the LL(1) grammars mostly interesting for its theoretical property that language equality of simple grammars is decidable, while language inclusion is not.\n* [[Bracketed grammar]]s have the property that the terminal symbols are divided into left and right bracket pairs that always match up in rules.\n* [[Linear grammar]]s have no rules with more than one nonterminal on the right-hand side.\n* [[Regular grammar]]s are a subclass of the linear grammars and describe the [[regular language|regular]] languages, i.e. they correspond to [[finite automaton|finite automata]] and [[regular expression]]s.\n\nLR parsing extends LL parsing to support a larger range of grammars; in turn, [[GLR parser|generalized LR parsing]] extends LR parsing to support arbitrary context-free grammars.  On LL grammars and LR grammars, it essentially performs LL parsing and LR parsing, respectively, while on [[nondeterministic grammar]]s, it is as efficient as can be expected.  Although GLR parsing was developed in the 1980s, many new language definitions and [[parser generator]]s continue to be based on LL, LALR or LR parsing up to the present day.\n\n== Linguistic applications ==\n[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] initially hoped to overcome the limitations of context-free grammars by adding [[transformational grammar|transformation rules]].<ref name=\"chomsky1956\"/>\n\nSuch rules are another standard device in traditional linguistics; e.g. [[grammatical voice|passivization]] in English. Much of [[generative grammar]] has been devoted to finding ways of refining the descriptive mechanisms of phrase-structure grammar and transformation rules such that exactly the kinds of things can be expressed that natural language actually allows. Allowing arbitrary transformations does not meet that goal: they are much too powerful, being [[Turing complete]] unless significant restrictions are added (e.g. no transformations that introduce and then rewrite symbols in a context-free fashion).\n\nChomsky's general position regarding the non-context-freeness of natural language has held up since then,<ref name=\"shieber1985\">{{citation | title=Evidence against the context-freeness of natural language | year=1985 | last=Shieber | first=Stuart | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=8 | pages=333\u2013343 | url=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~shieber/Biblio/Papers/shieber85.pdf | doi=10.1007/BF00630917 | issue=3}}.</ref> although his specific examples regarding the inadequacy of context-free grammars in terms of their weak generative capacity were later disproved.<ref name=\"pullum-gazdar1982\">{{citation | title=Natural languages and context-free languages | year=1982 | last=Pullum | first=Geoffrey K. | author2=Gerald Gazdar | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=4 | pages=471\u2013504 | doi=10.1007/BF00360802 | issue=4}}.</ref>\n[[Gerald Gazdar]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum]] have argued that despite a few non-context-free constructions in natural language (such as [[cross-serial dependencies]] in [[Swiss German]]<ref name=\"shieber1985\"/> and [[reduplication]] in [[Bambara language|Bambara]]<ref name=\"culy1985\">{{citation | title=The Complexity of the Vocabulary of Bambara | year=1985 | last=Culy | first=Christopher | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=8 | pages=345\u2013351 | doi=10.1007/BF00630918 | issue=3}}.</ref>), the vast majority of forms in natural language are indeed context-free.<ref name=\"pullum-gazdar1982\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Parsing expression grammar]]\n* [[Stochastic context-free grammar]]\n* [[Context-free grammar generation algorithms|Algorithms for context-free grammar generation]]\n* [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n<!--Group some notes as references-->\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation|first1=John E.|last1=Hopcroft|author1-link=John Hopcroft|first2=Jeffrey D.|last2=Ullman|author2-link=Jeffrey Ullman|title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1979}}.
