This part of territory is, since 1997, [[Asinara National Park|a national park]].\n\nThe morphology of \"city part\" is flat; the area of Porto Torres and the rest part of north-west Sardinia is characterized by a [[Nurra]] flat, there are some hill formation in the middle of the flat. Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with it thickness of 342&nbsp;m.\n\nThe communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo. The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]\nIn ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. \u00a7 5; Itin. Ant. p.&nbsp;83.</ref>\n\nThe ancient remains still existing prove that it must have been a considerable town under the [[Roman Empire]]. According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.\n\n[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''. The ancient city continued to be inhabited till the 11th century, when the greater part of the population migrated to [[Sassari]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} inland, and situated on a hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: De la Marmora, ''Voy. en Sardaigne'', vol. ii. pp.&nbsp;363,468-72; Smyth's Sardinia, pp.&nbsp;263-66.</ref> It was partly under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] hands before, in the early 15th century, it was conquered by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]].

This part of territory is, since 1997, [[Asinara National Park|a national park]].\n\nThe morphology of \"city part\" is flat; the area of Porto Torres and the rest part of north-west Sardinia is characterized by a [[Nurra]] flat, there are some hill formation in the middle of the flat. Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with it thickness of 342&nbsp;m.\n\nThe communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo. The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]\nIn ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. \u00a7 5; Itin. Ant. p.&nbsp;83.</ref>\n\nThe ancient remains still existing prove that it must have been a considerable town under the [[Roman Empire]]. According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.\n\n[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''. The ancient city continued to be inhabited till the 11th century, when the greater part of the population migrated to [[Sassari]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} inland, and situated on a hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: De la Marmora, ''Voy. en Sardaigne'', vol. ii. pp.&nbsp;363,468-72; Smyth's Sardinia, pp.&nbsp;263-66.</ref> It was partly under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] hands before, in the early 15th century, it was conquered by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]].

Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* The [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] originally closed to regular passenger services in 1969 reopened in 2003 with the intermediate station at [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] \n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n* Regular passenger services between Yeovil Junction and Yeovil Pen Mill were withdrawn in 1968 and a limited service reinstated in 2015 which has since slowly increased.\n\n===East Anglia/Lincolnshire===\n* {{rws|Needham Market}} closed in 1967 was reopened in 1971 and {{rws|Watlington}} closed in 1968 and reopened in 1975\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]]. The section between Peterborough and Spalding closed to passengers on 5 October 1970 and reopened on 7 June 1971.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.  Since closure in 1964 Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* Stations at {{rws|Syston}}, {{rws|Sileby}} and {{rws|Barrow-upon-Soar}} between Leicester and Loughborough closed in 1968 reopened in 1994. \n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Melton Mowbray Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] and Oakham closed to passengers on 18 April 1966. A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009 with [[Corby railway station|Corby]] served by direct trains to London and a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n* {{rws|Narborough}} was closed in 1968 but reopened two years later, {{rws|Peartree}} was closed in 1968 and reopened 1976, {{rws|Willington}} was closed in 1968 and reopened in 1994 and {{rws|Wigston Glen Parva}} was closed in 1968 and replaced with a new station {{rws|South Wigston}} in 1986 on an adjacent site.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}.

Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n\n===North East===\n* On the lines from Leeds/Bradford to Skipton the following stations closed in 1965 have been reopened (or replacement stations on adjacent sites)- {{rws|Apperley Bridge}}, {{rws|Frizinghall}}, {{rws|Saltaire}}, {{rws|Steeton and Silsden}} and {{rws|Cononley}}\n* The line from Wakefield Kirkgate to Pontefract Monkhill closed in 1967 was reopened in 1992 with {{rws|Pontefract Tanshelf}} and two new stations.\n* {{rws|Swinton (South Yorkshire)}}, {{rws|Fitzwilliam}} and {{rws|Adwick}} were originally closed in 1967 but new stations were opened on adjacent sites.\n* Passenger service from Bradford to Huddersfield withdrawn in 1970 was reinstated in 2000 with reopening of {{rws|Brighouse}} station. In 2017 trains also served {{rws|Low Moor}} which was originally closed in 1965.\n* Other stations reopened are {{rws|Dronfield}} (closed 1967 reopened 1981), {{rws|Slaithwaite}} (closed 1968 reopened 1982) and {{rws|Sherburn-in-Elmet}} (closed 1965 reopened 1984).\n\n===North West===\n* The Merseyrail line from Liverpool Central to Hunts Cross was closed in 1972 and mainly reopened in 1978.\n* {{rws|Wetheral}} closed in 1967 was reopened in 1981.\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n* On the Settle and Carlisle line most of the intermediate stations were closed in 1970 but regular passenger services were restored in 1986 to the following stations-{{rws|Horton-in-Ribblesdale}}, {{rws|Ribblehead}}, {{rws|Dent}}, {{rws|Garsdale}}, {{rws|Kirkby Stephen}}, {{rws|Langwathby}}, {{rws|Lazonby and Kirkoswald}} and {{rws|Armathwaite}}.\n\n===North Wales===\n* {{rws|Glan Conwy}} closed in 1964 reopened in 1970 and {{rws| Dolgarrog}} closed in 1964 but reopened the following year.\n* On the [[North Wales Coast Line]] the following stations closed in 1966 have been reopened [[Shotton railway station|Shotton Low Level]], {{rws|Conwy}}, {{rws|Llanfairpwll}} and {{rws|Valley}}\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced in 1992 serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan (opened 2007), Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n* {{rws|Penally}} closed in 1964 reopened in 1972 also {{rws|Fishguard and Goodwick}} closed for regular passenger services in 1964 reopened in 2012\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]]. Intermediate stations at {{Stnlnk|Dalmarnock}}, {{Stnlnk|Bridgeton}}, [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central Low Level]] and {{Stnlnk|Anderston}} were reopened, and a new station opened at {{Stnlnk|Argyle Street}}.\n* The [[Maryhill Line]] in [[Glasgow]] re-opened to stopping trains in 1993, which had ceased in the 1960s.  It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966. The majority of the route was reopened (with a revised terminus station at [[Whifflet railway station|Whifflet]]) in 1993.  \n* [[Croy Line|Stirling to Alloa]] reopened on 19 May 2008, providing a passenger service to Alloa on the route of the former Stirling-Dunfermline main line after a 40-year gap. This line had not been marked for closure by Beeching. The restored line also provides for freight onwards to Kincardine, and ultimately to Dunfermline by the slower, single track coastal route.

cuts]]''' were a reduction of route network and restructuring of [[British Rail]] in the 1960s. Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* The [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] originally closed to regular passenger services in 1969 reopened in 2003 with the intermediate station at [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] \n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n* Regular passenger services between Yeovil Junction and Yeovil Pen Mill were withdrawn in 1968 and a limited service reinstated in 2015 which has since slowly increased.\n\n===East Anglia/Lincolnshire===\n* {{rws|Needham Market}} closed in 1967 was reopened in 1971 and {{rws|Watlington}} closed in 1968 and reopened in 1975\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]]. The section between Peterborough and Spalding closed to passengers on 5 October 1970 and reopened on 7 June 1971.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.  Previously Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* Stations at {{rws|Syston}}, {{rws|Sileby}} and {{rws|Barrow-upon-Soar}} between Leicester and Loughborough closed in 1968 reopened in 1994. \n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Melton Mowbray Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] and Oakham closed to passengers on 18 April 1966. A line was reopened in 1987 with a shuttle service between Kettering and Corby, but the service was unreliable and lost funding support from the local council, leading to its closure in 1990. The line was then reopened on 23 February 2009 with [[Corby railway station|Corby]] served by direct trains to London and a limited number of trains continuing on towards Oakham and Melton Mowbray.\n* [[Alfreton railway station|Alfreton]], [[Langley Mill railway station|Langley Mill]] and [[Ilkeston railway station|Ilkeston]] stations on the [[Erewash Valley Line]] have since been reopened.\n* {{rws|Narborough}} was closed in 1968 but reopened two years later, {{rws|Peartree}} was closed in 1968 and reopened 1976, {{rws|Willington}} was closed in 1968 and reopened in 1994 and {{rws|Wigston Glen Parva}} was closed in 1968 and replaced with a new station {{rws|South Wigston}} in 1986 on an adjacent site.\n\n===West Midlands===\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station|Birmingham Snow Hill station]], after closing in 1972, was rebuilt and reopened in 1987 along with [[Snow Hill Tunnel (Birmingham)|Snow Hill tunnel]] underneath [[Birmingham]] city centre to {{stnlnk|Birmingham Moor Street}}.

Some commentators believe an intermediate station at Willenhall should have been included with the original reopening.\n* The [[Cotswold Line]] has been redoubled in places and [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] station reopened.\n\n===North East===\n* On the lines from Leeds/Bradford to Skipton the following stations closed in 1965 have been reopened (or replacement stations on adjacent sites)- {{rws|Apperley Bridge}}, {{rws|Frizinghall}}, {{rws|Saltaire}}, {{rws|Steeton and Silsden}} and {{rws|Cononley}}\n* The line from Wakefield Kirkgate to Pontefract Monkhill closed in 1967 was reopened in 1992 with {{rws|Pontefract Tanshelf}} and two new stations.\n* {{rws|Swinton (South Yorkshire)}}, {{rws|Fitzwilliam}} and {{rws|Adwick}} were originally closed in 1967 but new stations were opened on adjacent sites.\n* Passenger service from Bradford to Huddersfield withdrawn in 1970 was reinstated in 2000 with reopening of {{rws|Brighouse}} station. In 2017 trains also served {{rws|Low Moor}} which was originally closed in 1965.\n* Other stations reopened are {{rws|Dronfield}} (closed 1967 reopened 1981), {{rws|Slaithwaite}} (closed 1968 reopened 1982) and {{rws|Sherburn-in-Elmet}} (closed 1965 reopened 1984).\n\n===North West===\n* The Merseyrail line from Liverpool Central to Hunts Cross was closed in 1972 and mainly reopened in 1978.\n* {{rws|Wetheral}} closed in 1967 was reopened in 1981.\n* The route out of Manchester Central over the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]]'s Manchester South District Line has been reopened by [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]].  The line opened to [[St Werburgh's Road tram stop|St Werburgh's Road]] (via Chorlton) in July 2011 and was extended as far as [[East Didsbury tram stop|East Didsbury]] in May 2013.\n* On the Settle and Carlisle line most of the intermediate stations were closed in 1970 but regular passenger services were restored in 1986 to the following stations-{{rws|Horton-in-Ribblesdale}}, {{rws|Ribblehead}}, {{rws|Dent}}, {{rws|Garsdale}}, {{rws|Kirkby Stephen}}, {{rws|Langwathby}}, {{rws|Lazonby and Kirkoswald}} and {{rws|Armathwaite}}.\n\n===North Wales===\n* {{rws|Glan Conwy}} closed in 1964 reopened in 1970 and {{rws| Dolgarrog}} closed in 1964 but reopened the following year.\n* On the [[North Wales Coast Line]] the following stations closed in 1966 have been reopened [[Shotton railway station|Shotton Low Level]], {{rws|Conwy}}, {{rws|Llanfairpwll}} and {{rws|Valley}}\n\n===South Wales===\n* 32 new stations and four lines reopened within 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) of each other: [[Merthyr Line|Abercynon\u2013Aberdare]], [[Vale of Glamorgan Line|Barry\u2013Bridgend]] via {{Stnlnk|Llantwit Major}}, [[Maesteg Line|Bridgend\u2013Maesteg]] and the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] via [[Newbridge railway station (Wales)|Newbridge]].\n* Stopping trains between Cardiff and Swansea re-introduced in 1992 serving reopened stations at Pontclun, Llanharan (opened 2007), Pencoed, Pyle, Baglan, Briton Ferry, Skewen and Llansamlet.\n* {{rws|Penally}} closed in 1964 reopened in 1972 also {{rws|Fishguard and Goodwick}} closed for regular passenger services in 1964 reopened in 2012\n\n===Scotland===\n* [[Glasgow Central Railway]] between {{Stnlnk|Rutherglen}} and {{Stnlnk|Stobcross}} was reopened in November 1979, establishing the [[Argyle Line]] connecting the Hamilton Circle to the [[North Clyde Line]].

It is a suburban railway line linking central Glasgow ([[Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]]) and [[Anniesland]] via [[Maryhill]].\n* The Argyle Line was extended in December 2005 when a four-mile (6.4&nbsp;km) section of the Mid Lanark Lines of the [[Caledonian Railway]] reopened, serving {{Stnlnk|Chatelherault}}, {{Stnlnk|Merryton}} and {{Stnlnk|Larkhall}}.<ref>[http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html SPT News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922170017/http://www.spt.co.uk/news/story318.html |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]]'s [[Paisley Canal line]] was closed to passengers in 1983.  The majority of the route reopened in 1990.\n* The [[Caledonian Railway]]'s [[Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway]] closed to passengers in 1966.

{"title_page": "Surrogate model", "text_new": "A '''surrogate model''' is an engineering method used when an outcome of interest cannot be easily directly measured,{{disputed inline|Used when outcome cannot be directly measured?|date=January 2020}} so a model of the outcome is used instead. Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as a function of design variables.  For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the airflow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..).  For many real-world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete.  As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and ''what-if'' analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.\n\nOne way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as '''surrogate models''', [[Response surface methodology|response surface models]], ''metamodels'' or ''emulators'', that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven, bottom-up approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important. A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points. This approach is also known as behavioral modeling or black-box modeling, though the terminology is not always consistent.  When only a single design variable is involved, the process is known as [[curve fitting]].\n\nThough using surrogate models in lieu of experiments and simulations in engineering design is more common, surrogate modeling may be used in many other areas of science where there are expensive experiments and/or function evaluations.\n\n==Goals==\n\nThe scientific challenge of surrogate modeling is the generation of a surrogate that is as accurate as possible, using as few simulation evaluations as possible. The process comprises three major steps which may be interleaved iteratively:\n\n* Sample selection (also known as sequential design, optimal experimental design (OED) or active learning)\n* Construction of the surrogate model and optimizing the model parameters (bias-variance trade-off)\n* Appraisal of the accuracy of the surrogate.\n\nThe accuracy of the surrogate depends on the number and location of samples (expensive experiments or simulations) in the design space.

Most engineering design problems require experiments and/or simulations to evaluate design objective and constraint functions as a function of design variables.  For example, in order to find the optimal airfoil shape for an aircraft wing, an engineer simulates the airflow around the wing for different shape variables (length, curvature, material, ..).  For many real-world problems, however, a single simulation can take many minutes, hours, or even days to complete.  As a result, routine tasks such as design optimization, design space exploration, sensitivity analysis and ''what-if'' analysis become impossible since they require thousands or even millions of simulation evaluations.\n\nOne way of alleviating this burden is by constructing approximation models, known as '''surrogate models''', [[Response surface methodology|response surface models]], ''metamodels'' or ''emulators'', that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible while being computationally cheap(er) to evaluate. Surrogate models are constructed using a data-driven, bottom-up approach. The exact, inner working of the simulation code is not assumed to be known (or even understood), solely the input-output behavior is important. A model is constructed based on modeling the response of the simulator to a limited number of intelligently chosen data points. This approach is also known as behavioral modeling or black-box modeling, though the terminology is not always consistent.  When only a single design variable is involved, the process is known as [[curve fitting]].\n\nThough using surrogate models in lieu of experiments and simulations in engineering design is more common, surrogate modeling may be used in many other areas of science where there are expensive experiments and/or function evaluations.\n\n==Goals==\n\nThe scientific challenge of surrogate modeling is the generation of a surrogate that is as accurate as possible, using as few simulation evaluations as possible. The process comprises three major steps which may be interleaved iteratively:\n\n* Sample selection (also known as sequential design, optimal experimental design (OED) or active learning)\n* Construction of the surrogate model and optimizing the model parameters (bias-variance trade-off)\n* Appraisal of the accuracy of the surrogate.\n\nThe accuracy of the surrogate depends on the number and location of samples (expensive experiments or simulations) in the design space. Various [[design of experiments]] (DOE) techniques cater to different sources of errors, in particular, errors due to noise in the data or errors due to an improper surrogate model.\n\n==Types of surrogate models==\n\nPopular surrogate modeling approaches are: polynomial [[response surface]]s; [[kriging]]; [[gradient-enhanced kriging]] (GEK); [[radial basis function]]; [[support vector machine]]s; [[space mapping]] <ref name=\"space mapping\">J.W.
