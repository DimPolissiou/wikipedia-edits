They are also used in offline applications, like [[electronic signature]]s. An X.509 certificate contains a public key and an identity (a hostname, or an organization, or an individual), and is either signed by a [[certificate authority]] or self-signed. When a certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority, or validated by other means, someone holding that certificate can rely on the public key it contains to establish secure communications with another party, or validate documents [[Digital signature|digitally signed]] by the corresponding [[private key]].\n\nX.509 also defines [[certificate revocation list]]s, which are a means to distribute information about certificates that have been deemed invalid by a signing authority, as well as a [[certification path validation algorithm]], which allows for certificates to be signed by intermediate CA certificates, which are, in turn, signed by other certificates, eventually reaching a [[trust anchor]].\n\nX.509 is defined by the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Telecommunications Union's]] Standardization sector ([[ITU-T]]), and is based on [[Abstract Syntax Notation One|ASN.1]], another ITU-T standard.\n\n==History and usage==\nX.509 was initially issued on July 3, 1988 and was begun in association with the [[X.500]] standard.  It assumes a strict hierarchical system of [[certificate authority|certificate authorities]] (CAs) for issuing the certificates. This contrasts with [[web of trust]] models, like [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], where anyone (not just special CAs) may sign and thus attest to the validity of others' key certificates. Version 3 of X.509 includes the flexibility to support other topologies like [[network bridge|bridges]] and [[Mesh network|meshes]].<ref name=\":0\">RFC 4158</ref>  It can be used in a peer-to-peer, [[OpenPGP]]-like web of trust,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} but was rarely used that way as of 2004. The X.500 system has only been implemented by sovereign nations for state identity information sharing treaty fulfillment purposes, and the [[IETF]]'s Public-Key Infrastructure (X.509), or PKIX, working group has adapted the standard to the more flexible organization of the Internet. In fact, the term ''X.509 certificate'' usually refers to the IETF's PKIX certificate and [[revocation list|CRL]] Profile of the X.509 v3 certificate standard, as specified in RFC 5280, commonly called PKIX for ''Public Key Infrastructure (X.509)''.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Certificates==\nIn the X.509 system, an organization that wants a signed certificate requests one via a [[certificate signing request]] (CSR).\n\nTo do this, it first generates a [[key pair]], keeping the [[Private-key cryptography|private key]] secret and using it to sign the CSR. This contains information identifying the applicant and the applicant's [[public-key cryptography|public key]] that is used to verify the signature of the CSR - and the [[Distinguished Name]] (DN) that the certificate is for. The CSR may be accompanied by other credentials or proofs of identity required by the certificate authority.\n\nThe [[certification authority]] issues a certificate binding a public key to a particular [[Distinguished Name#Directory structure|distinguished name]].\n\nAn organization's trusted [[root certificate]]s can be distributed to all employees so that they can use the company PKI system.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Browsers such as [[Internet Explorer]], [[Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] and [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] come with a predetermined set of root certificates pre-installed, so [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] certificates from major certificate authorities will work instantly; in effect the browsers' developers determine which CAs are trusted third parties for the browsers' users.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} For example, Firefox provides a CSV and/or HTML file containing a list of Included CAs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:IncludedCAs|title=CA:IncludedCAs - MozillaWiki|website=wiki.mozilla.org|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref>\n\nX.509 and RFC 5280 also include standards for certificate [[revocation list]] (CRL) implementations. Another [[IETF]]-approved way of checking a certificate's validity is the [[Online Certificate Status Protocol]] (OCSP). Firefox 3 enables OCSP checking by default, as do versions of Windows from at least Vista and later.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110161 | title=Bug 110161 - (ocspdefault) enable OCSP by default |accessdate=2016-03-17}}</ref>\n\n===Structure of a certificate===\nThe structure foreseen by the standards is expressed in a formal language, [[Abstract Syntax Notation One]] (ASN.1).\n\nThe structure of an X.509 v3 [[digital certificate]] is as follows:\n* Certificate\n**Version Number\n**Serial Number\n**Signature Algorithm ID\n**Issuer Name\n**Validity period\n***Not Before\n***Not After\n**Subject name\n**Subject Public Key Info\n***Public Key Algorithm\n***Subject Public Key\n**Issuer Unique Identifier (optional)\n**Subject Unique Identifier (optional)\n**Extensions (optional)\n*** ...\n*Certificate Signature Algorithm\n*Certificate Signature\n\nEach extension has its own ID, expressed as [[object identifier]], which is a set of values, together with either a critical or non-critical indication.  A certificate-using system must reject the certificate if it encounters a critical extension that it does not recognize, or a critical extension that contains information that it cannot process.  A non-critical extension may be ignored if it is not recognized, but must be processed if it is recognized.<ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2, RFC 5280 section 4.2, retrieved 12 February 2013]</ref>\n\nThe structure of version 1 is given in <nowiki>RFC 1422</nowiki>.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1422 RFC 1422]</ref>\n\nITU-T introduced issuer and subject unique identifiers in version 2 to permit the reuse of issuer or subject name after some time.  An example of reuse will be when a [[certificate authority|CA]] goes bankrupt and its name is deleted from the country's public list.  After some time another CA with the same name may register itself, even though it is unrelated to the first one. However, [[IETF]] recommends that no issuer and subject names be reused.  Therefore, version 2 is not widely deployed in the Internet.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nExtensions were introduced in version 3. A CA can use extensions to issue a certificate only for a specific purpose (e.g. only for [[code signing|signing digital objects]]).\n\nIn all versions, the serial number must be unique for each certificate issued by a specific CA (as mentioned in <nowiki>RFC 5280</nowiki>).\n\n===Extensions informing a specific usage of a certificate===\n<nowiki>RFC 5280</nowiki> (and its predecessors) defines a number of certificate extensions which indicate how the certificate should be used. Most of them are arcs from the <tt>joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) id-ce(29)</tt> OID. Some of the most common, defined in section 4.2.1, are:\n\n* Basic Constraints, <tt>{ id-ce 19 }</tt>,<ref>\n  {{cite web\n    | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.9\n    | title =RFC 5280, Section 'Basic Constraints'\n  }}\n</ref> are used to indicate whether the certificate belongs to a CA.\n* Key Usage, <tt>{ id-ce 15 }</tt>,<ref>\n  {{cite web\n    | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.3\n    | title ='RFC 5280, Section 'Key Usage'\n  }}\n</ref> provides a bitmap specifying the cryptographic operations which may be performed using the public key contained in the certificate; for example, it could indicate that the key should be used for signatures but not for encipherment.\n* Extended Key Usage, <tt>{ id-ce 37 }</tt>,<ref>\n  {{cite web\n    | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12\n    | title = RFC 5280, Section 'Extended Key Usage'\n  }}\n</ref> is used, typically on a leaf certificate, to indicate the purpose of the public key contained in the certificate. It contains a list of OIDs, each of which indicates an allowed use. For example, <tt>{ id-pkix 3 1  }</tt> indicates that the key may be used on the server end of a TLS or SSL connection; <tt>{ id-pkix 3 4  }</tt> indicates that the key may be used to secure email.\n\nIn general, if a certificate has several extensions restricting its use, all restrictions must be satisfied for a given use to be appropriate. <nowiki>RFC 5280</nowiki> gives the specific example of a certificate containing both keyUsage and extendedKeyUsage: in this case, both must be processed and the certificate can only be used if both extensions are coherent in specifying the usage of a certificate. For example, [[Network Security Services|NSS]] uses both extensions to specify certificate usage.<ref>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/nss_tech_notes/nss_tech_note3 All About Certificate Extensions]</ref>\n\n===Certificate filename extensions===\nThere are several commonly used filename extensions for X.509 certificates.  Unfortunately, some of these extensions are also used for other data such as private keys.\n\n* <tt>.pem</tt> \u2013 ([[Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail]]) [[Base64]] encoded [[Distinguished Encoding Rules|DER]] certificate, enclosed between \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\" and \"-----END CERTIFICATE-----\"\n* <tt>.cer</tt>, <tt>.crt</tt>, <tt>.der</tt> \u2013 usually in binary [[Distinguished Encoding Rules|DER]] form, but Base64-encoded certificates are common too (see <tt>.pem</tt> above)\n* <tt>.p7b</tt>, <tt>.p7c</tt> \u2013 [[PKCS7|PKCS#7]] SignedData structure without data, just certificate(s) or [[revocation list|CRL]](s)\n* <tt>.p12</tt> \u2013 [[PKCS12|PKCS#12]], may contain certificate(s) (public) and private keys (password protected)\n* <tt>.pfx</tt> \u2013 PFX, predecessor of PKCS#12 (usually contains data in PKCS#12 format, e.g., with PFX files generated in [[Internet Information Services|IIS]])\n\n[[PKCS7|PKCS#7]] is a standard for signing or encrypting (officially called \"enveloping\") data. Since the certificate is needed to verify signed data, it is possible to include them in the SignedData structure. A <tt>.P7C</tt> file is a degenerated SignedData structure, without any data to sign.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n[[PKCS12|PKCS#12]] evolved from the ''personal information exchange'' (PFX) standard and is used to exchange public and private objects in a single file.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Certificate chains and cross-certification==\nA '''certificate chain''' (see the equivalent concept of \"certification path\" defined by RFC 5280)<ref name =\"RFC 5280 Certification Path Validation\">{{cite book\n  | title = Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile\n  | publisher = Network Working Group\n  | year = 2008\n  | section = Certification Path Validation \n  | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#page-71\n}}</ref> is a list of certificates (usually starting with an end-entity certificate) followed by one or more [[Certificate authority|CA]] certificates (usually the last one being a self-signed certificate), with the following properties:\n# The Issuer of each certificate (except the last one) matches the Subject of the next certificate in the list.\n# Each certificate (except the last one) is supposed to be signed by the secret key corresponding to the next certificate in the chain (i.e. the signature of one certificate can be verified using the public key contained in the following certificate).\n# The last certificate in the list is a [[trust anchor]]: a certificate that you trust because it was delivered to you by some trustworthy procedure.\n\nCertificate chains are used in order to check that the public key (PK) contained in a target certificate (the first certificate in the chain) and other data contained in it effectively belongs to its subject. In order to ascertain this, the signature on the target certificate is verified by using the PK contained in the following certificate, whose signature is verified using the next certificate, and so on until the last certificate in the chain is reached. As the last certificate is a trust anchor, successfully reaching it will prove that the target certificate can be trusted.\n\nThe description in the preceding paragraph is a simplified view on the [[certification path validation algorithm|certification path validation process]] as defined by RFC 5280,<ref name=\"RFC 5280 Certification Path Validation\"/> which involves additional checks, such as verifying validity dates on certificates, looking up [[revocation list|CRLs]], etc.\n\n[[File:Cross-certification diagram.svg|thumb|350px|right|Example 1: Cross-certification between two PKIs]]\n[[File:CA certificate renewal.png|frame|right|Example 2: CA certificate renewal]]\n\nExamining how certificate chains are built and validated, it is important to note that a concrete certificate can be part of very different certificate chains (all of them valid). This is because several CA certificates can be generated for the same subject and public key, but be signed with different private keys (from different CAs or different private keys from the same CA). So, although a single X.509 certificate can have only one issuer and one CA signature, it can be validly linked to more than one certificate, building completely different certificate chains. This is crucial for cross-certification between PKIs and other applications.<ref name=\"Understanding Certification Path Construction\">\n{{cite book\n  |title=Understanding Certification Path Construction\n  |date=September 2002\n  |publisher=PKI Forum\n  |last=Lloyd\n  |first=Steve\n  |url=http://www.oasis-pki.org/pdfs/Understanding_Path_construction-DS2.pdf\n}}\n</ref>\nSee the following examples.\n\nIn these diagrams:\n* Each box represents a certificate, with its Subject in bold.\n* A \u2192 B means \"A is signed by B\" (or, more precisely, \"A is signed by the secret key corresponding to the public key contained in B\"). \n* Certificates with the same color (that are not white/transparent) contain the same public key.\n\n===Example 1: Cross-certification at root Certification Authority (CA) level between two PKIs===\n\nIn order to manage that user certificates existing in PKI 2 (like \"User 2\") are trusted by PKI 1, CA1 generates a certificate (cert2.1) containing the public key of CA2.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |title=Qualified Subordination Deployment Scenarios\n  |date=August 2009\n  |publisher=Microsoft\n  |section=Cross-Certification Between Root CAs\n  |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc785267(v=ws.10).aspx\n}}\n</ref>\nNow both \"cert2 and cert2.1 (in green) have the same subject and public key, so there are two valid chains for cert2.2 (User 2): \"cert2.2 \u2192 cert2\" and \"cert2.2 \u2192 cert2.1 \u2192 cert1\".\n\nSimilarly, CA2 can generate a certificate (cert1.1) containing the public key of CA1 so that user certificates existing in PKI 1 (like \"User 1\") are trusted by PKI 2.\n\n===Example 2: CA certificate renewal===\n{{cite book\n  |title=Understanding Certification Path Construction\n  |date=September 2002\n  |publisher=PKI Forum\n  |url=http://www.oasis-pki.org/pdfs/Understanding_Path_construction-DS2.pdf \n  |quote=To allow for graceful transition from the old signing key pair to the new signing key pair, the CA should issue a certificate that contains the old public key signed by the new private signing key and a certificate that contains the new public key signed by the old private signing key.

Note that these are in addition to the two self-signed certificates (one old, one new).\n}}\n\nSince both cert1 and cert3 contain the same public key (the old one), there are two valid certificate chains for cert5: \"cert5 \u2192 cert1\" and \"cert5 \u2192 cert3 \u2192 cert2\", and analogously for cert6. This allows that old user certificates (such as cert5) and new certificates (such as cert6) can be trusted indifferently by a party having either the new root CA certificate or the old one as trust anchor during the transition to the new CA keys.<ref name=\" PKI Implementing and Managing E-Security\">\n{{cite book\n  |title=PKI: Implementing and Managing E-Security\n  |year=2001\n  |publisher=RSA Press - Osborne/McGraw-Hill\n  |last1=Nash\n  |last2=Duane\n  |last3=Joseph\n  |last4=Brink\n  |isbn=0-07-213123-3\n  |section=Key and Certificate Life Cycles.

So most clients do trust certificates when CRLs are not available, but in that case an attacker that controls the communication channel can disable the CRLs.  Adam Langley of Google has said soft-fail CRL checks are like a safety belt that works except when you have an accident.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Langley|first1=Adam|title=Revocation checking and Chrome's CRL (05 Feb 2012)|url=https://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/02/05/crlsets.html|website=Imperial Violet|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n*CRLs are notably a poor choice because of large sizes and convoluted distribution patterns,\n*Ambiguous OCSP semantics and lack of historical revocation status,\n*Revocation of root certificates is not addressed,\n*'''Aggregation problem''': Identity claims (authenticate with an identifier), attribute claims (submit a bag of vetted attributes), and policy claims are combined in a single container. This raises privacy, policy mapping, and maintenance issues.{{clarify|date=March 2018}}\n*'''Delegation problem''': CAs cannot technically restrict subordinate CAs from issuing certificates outside a limited namespaces or attribute set; this feature of X.509 is not in use. Therefore, a large number of CAs exist on the Internet, and classifying them and their policies is an insurmountable task. Delegation of authority within an organization cannot be handled at all, as in common business practice.\n*'''Federation problem''': Certificate chains that are the result of subordinate CAs, bridge CAs, and cross-signing make validation complex and expensive in terms of processing time. Path validation semantics may be ambiguous. The hierarchy with a third-party trusted party is the only model. This is inconvenient when a bilateral trust relationship is already in place.\n*Issuance of an [[Extended Validation Certificate|Extended Validation (EV) certificate]] for a hostname doesn't prevent issuance of a lower-validation certificate valid for the same hostname, which means that the higher validation level of EV doesn't protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.<ref>[https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-09/SOTIROV/BHUSA09-Sotirov-AttackExtSSL-PAPER.pdf Zusman and Sotirov Blackhat 2009]</ref>\n\n===Problems with certificate authorities===\n* The subject, not the relying party, purchases certificates. The subject will often utilize the cheapest issuer, so quality is not being paid for in the competing market. This is partly addressed by [[Extended Validation]] certificates, yet trust value in the eyes of security experts are diminishing. <ref name=\"troyhuntevcertsdead\">{{cite web|last1=Hunt|first1=Troy|title=Extended Validation Certificates are Dead|url=https://www.troyhunt.com/extended-validation-certificates-are-dead/|website=TroyHunt.com|accessdate=26 February 2019|ref=troyhuntevcertsdead}}</ref>\n* Certification authorities deny almost all warranties to the user (including subject or even relying parties).\n* \"Users use an undefined certification request protocol to obtain a certificate which is published in an unclear location in a nonexistent directory with no real means to revoke it.\"<ref name=\"gutmann1\"/>\n* Like all businesses, CAs are subject to the legal jurisdictions they operate within, and may be legally compelled to compromise the interests of their customers and their users. Intelligence agencies have also made use of false certificates issued through extralegal compromise of CAs, such as [[DigiNotar]], to carry out [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Another example is a revocation request of the CA of the Dutch government, because of a new Dutch law becoming active starting January 1, 2018, giving new powers for the Dutch intelligence and security services.<ref name=\"van Pelt\">{{cite web|last1=van Pelt|first1=Cris|title=Logius: Dutch Government CA trust issue|url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408647|website=Bugzilla|accessdate=31 October 2017|ref=vanPelt}}</ref>\n\n===Implementation issues===\nImplementations suffer from design flaws, bugs, different interpretations of standards and lack of interoperability of different standards.

ITU-T X.690, clause 8.19.2</ref> 0x80 padded subidentifiers of [[object identifier]]s, wrong implementations or by using integer overflows of the client's browsers, an attacker can include an unknown attribute in the CSR, which the CA will sign, which the client wrongly interprets as \"CN\" (OID=2.5.4.3). Dan Kaminsky at the 26th  [[Chaos Communication Congress]] \"Black OPs of PKI\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan/events/3658.en.html|title=26C3: Black Ops Of PKI|date=|publisher=Events.ccc.de|accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref>\n\n===Cryptographic weaknesses===\nDigital signature systems depend on secure [[cryptographic hash function]]s to work. When a public key infrastructure allows the use of a hash function that is no longer secure, an attacker can exploit weaknesses in the hash function to forge certificates. Specifically, if an attacker is able to produce a [[Collision resistance|hash collision]], they can convince a CA to sign a certificate with innocuous contents, where the hash of those contents is identical to the hash of another, malicious set of certificate contents, created by the attacker with values of their choosing. The attacker can then append the CA-provided signature to their malicious certificate contents, resulting in a malicious certificate that appears to be signed by the CA. Because the malicious certificate contents are chosen solely by the attacker, they can have different validity dates or hostnames than the innocuous certificate. The malicious certificate can even contain a \"CA: true\" field making it able to issue further trusted certificates.\n* MD2-based certificates were used for a long time and were vulnerable to [[preimage attack]]s. Since the root certificate already had a self-signature, attackers could use this signature and use it for an intermediate certificate.\n* In 2005, [[Arjen Lenstra]] and [[Benne de Weger]] demonstrated \"how to use hash collisions to construct two X.509 certificates that contain identical signatures and that differ only in the public keys\", achieved using a [[collision attack]] on the [[MD5]] hash function.<ref name=\"Lenstra & de Weger\">{{cite techreport |first1=Arjen |last1=Lenstra |authorlink1=Arjen Lenstra |first2=Benne |last2=de Weger  |title=On the possibility of constructing meaningful hash collisions for public keys |url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~bdeweger/CollidingCertificates/ddl-full.pdf |accessdate=2013-09-28 |date=2005-05-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514200135/http://www.win.tue.nl/~bdeweger/CollidingCertificates/ddl-full.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-14 |url-status=live |location=Murray Hill, NJ, USA & Eindhoven, The Netherlands |publisher=[[Lucent Technologies]], [[Bell Laboratories]] & [[Technische Universiteit Eindhoven]]}}</ref>\n* In 2008, [[Alexander Sotirov]] and [[Marc Stevens (computer scientist)|Marc Stevens]] presented at the [[Chaos Communication Congress]] a practical attack that allowed them to create a rogue Certificate Authority, accepted by all common browsers, by exploiting the fact that RapidSSL was still issuing X.509 certificates based on MD5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/ |title=MD5 considered harmful today |publisher=Win.tue.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref>\n* In April 2009 at the Eurocrypt Conference,<ref>[https://www.iacr.org/conferences/eurocrypt2009/ Eurocrypt Conference]</ref> Australian Researchers of Macquarie University presented \"Automatic Differential Path Searching for [[SHA-1]]\".<ref>[http://eurocrypt2009rump.cr.yp.to/837a0a8086fa6ca714249409ddfae43d.pdf \"Automatic Differential Path Searching for SHA-1\"]</ref> The researchers were able to deduce a method which increases the likelihood of a collision by several orders of magnitude.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Litke|first1=Pat|title=SHA-1 Collision Attacks Now 252 |url=https://www.secureworks.com/blog/research-20935|website=SecureWorks|publisher=SecureWorks Insights|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref>\n* In February 2017, a group of researchers led by Marc Stevens produced a  SHA-1 collision, demonstrating SHA-1's weakness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shattered.io/static/shattered.pdf|title=The first collision for full SHA-1}}</ref>\n\n==== Mitigations for cryptographic weaknesses ====\nExploiting a hash collision to forge X.509 signatures requires that the attacker be able to predict the data that the certificate authority will sign.

When a certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority, or validated by other means, someone holding that certificate can rely on the public key it contains to establish secure communications with another party, or validate documents [[Digital signature|digitally signed]] by the corresponding [[private key]].\n\nX.509 also defines [[certificate revocation list]]s, which are a means to distribute information about certificates that have been deemed invalid by a signing authority, as well as a [[certification path validation algorithm]], which allows for certificates to be signed by intermediate CA certificates, which are, in turn, signed by other certificates, eventually reaching a [[trust anchor]].\n\nX.509 is defined by the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Telecommunications Union's]] Standardization sector ([[ITU-T]]), and is based on [[Abstract Syntax Notation One|ASN.1]], another ITU-T standard.\n\n==History and usage==\nX.509 was initially issued on July 3, 1988 and was begun in association with the [[X.500]] standard.  It assumes a strict hierarchical system of [[certificate authority|certificate authorities]] (CAs) for issuing the certificates. This contrasts with [[web of trust]] models, like [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], where anyone (not just special CAs) may sign and thus attest to the validity of others' key certificates. Version 3 of X.509 includes the flexibility to support other topologies like [[network bridge|bridges]] and [[Mesh network|meshes]].<ref name=\":0\">RFC 4158</ref>  It can be used in a peer-to-peer, [[OpenPGP]]-like web of trust,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} but was rarely used that way as of 2004. The X.500 system has only been implemented by sovereign nations for state identity information sharing treaty fulfillment purposes, and the [[IETF]]'s Public-Key Infrastructure (X.509), or PKIX, working group has adapted the standard to the more flexible organization of the Internet. In fact, the term ''X.509 certificate'' usually refers to the IETF's PKIX certificate and [[revocation list|CRL]] Profile of the X.509 v3 certificate standard, as specified in RFC 5280, commonly called PKIX for ''Public Key Infrastructure (X.509)''.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Certificates==\nIn the X.509 system, an organization that wants a signed certificate requests one via a [[certificate signing request]] (CSR).\n\nTo do this, it first generates a [[key pair]], keeping the [[Private-key cryptography|private key]] secret and using it to sign the CSR. This contains information identifying the applicant and the applicant's [[public-key cryptography|public key]] that is used to verify the signature of the CSR - and the [[Distinguished Name]] (DN) that the certificate is for. The CSR may be accompanied by other credentials or proofs of identity required by the certificate authority.\n\nThe [[certification authority]] issues a certificate binding a public key to a particular [[Distinguished Name#Directory structure|distinguished name]].\n\nAn organization's trusted [[root certificate]]s can be distributed to all employees so that they can use the company PKI system.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Browsers such as [[Internet Explorer]], [[Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] and [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] come with a predetermined set of root certificates pre-installed, so [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] certificates from major certificate authorities will work instantly; in effect the browsers' developers determine which CAs are trusted third parties for the browsers' users.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} For example, Firefox provides a CSV and/or HTML file containing a list of Included CAs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:IncludedCAs|title=CA:IncludedCAs - MozillaWiki|website=wiki.mozilla.org|access-date=2017-01-17}}</ref>\n\nX.509 and RFC 5280 also include standards for certificate [[revocation list]] (CRL) implementations. Another [[IETF]]-approved way of checking a certificate's validity is the [[Online Certificate Status Protocol]] (OCSP). Firefox 3 enables OCSP checking by default, as do versions of Windows from at least Vista and later.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110161 | title=Bug 110161 - (ocspdefault) enable OCSP by default |accessdate=2016-03-17}}</ref>\n\n===Structure of a certificate===\nThe structure foreseen by the standards is expressed in a formal language, [[Abstract Syntax Notation One]] (ASN.1).\n\nThe structure of an X.509 v3 [[digital certificate]] is as follows:\n* Certificate\n**Version Number\n**Serial Number\n**Signature Algorithm ID\n**Issuer Name\n**Validity period\n***Not Before\n***Not After\n**Subject name\n**Subject Public Key Info\n***Public Key Algorithm\n***Subject Public Key\n**Issuer Unique Identifier (optional)\n**Subject Unique Identifier (optional)\n**Extensions (optional)\n*** ...\n*Certificate Signature Algorithm\n*Certificate Signature\n\nEach extension has its own ID, expressed as [[object identifier]], which is a set of values, together with either a critical or non-critical indication.  A certificate-using system must reject the certificate if it encounters a critical extension that it does not recognize, or a critical extension that contains information that it cannot process.  A non-critical extension may be ignored if it is not recognized, but must be processed if it is recognized.<ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2, RFC 5280 section 4.2, retrieved 12 February 2013]</ref>\n\nThe structure of version 1 is given in <nowiki>RFC 1422</nowiki>.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1422 RFC 1422]</ref>\n\nITU-T introduced issuer and subject unique identifiers in version 2 to permit the reuse of issuer or subject name after some time.  An example of reuse will be when a [[certificate authority|CA]] goes bankrupt and its name is deleted from the country's public list.  After some time another CA with the same name may register itself, even though it is unrelated to the first one. However, [[IETF]] recommends that no issuer and subject names be reused.  Therefore, version 2 is not widely deployed in the Internet.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nExtensions were introduced in version 3. A CA can use extensions to issue a certificate only for a specific purpose (e.g. only for [[code signing|signing digital objects]]).\n\nIn all versions, the serial number must be unique for each certificate issued by a specific CA (as mentioned in <nowiki>RFC 5280</nowiki>).\n\n===Extensions informing a specific usage of a certificate===\n<nowiki>RFC 5280</nowiki> (and its predecessors) defines a number of certificate extensions which indicate how the certificate should be used. Most of them are arcs from the <tt>joint-iso-ccitt(2) ds(5) id-ce(29)</tt> OID. Some of the most common, defined in section 4.2.1, are:\n\n* Basic Constraints, <tt>{ id-ce 19 }</tt>,<ref>\n  {{cite web\n    | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.9\n    | title =RFC 5280, Section 'Basic Constraints'\n  }}\n</ref> are used to indicate whether the certificate belongs to a CA.\n* Key Usage, <tt>{ id-ce 15 }</tt>,<ref>\n  {{cite web\n    | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.3\n    | title ='RFC 5280, Section 'Key Usage'\n  }}\n</ref> provides a bitmap specifying the cryptographic operations which may be performed using the public key contained in the certificate; for example, it could indicate that the key should be used for signatures but not for encipherment.\n* Extended Key Usage, <tt>{ id-ce 37 }</tt>,<ref>\n  {{cite web\n    | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12\n    | title = RFC 5280, Section 'Extended Key Usage'\n  }}\n</ref> is used, typically on a leaf certificate, to indicate the purpose of the public key contained in the certificate. It contains a list of OIDs, each of which indicates an allowed use. For example, <tt>{ id-pkix 3 1  }</tt> indicates that the key may be used on the server end of a TLS or SSL connection; <tt>{ id-pkix 3 4  }</tt> indicates that the key may be used to secure email.\n\nIn general, if a certificate has several extensions restricting its use, all restrictions must be satisfied for a given use to be appropriate. <nowiki>RFC 5280</nowiki> gives the specific example of a certificate containing both keyUsage and extendedKeyUsage: in this case, both must be processed and the certificate can only be used if both extensions are coherent in specifying the usage of a certificate. For example, [[Network Security Services|NSS]] uses both extensions to specify certificate usage.<ref>[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/nss_tech_notes/nss_tech_note3 All About Certificate Extensions]</ref>\n\n===Certificate filename extensions===\nThere are several commonly used filename extensions for X.509 certificates.  Unfortunately, some of these extensions are also used for other data such as private keys.\n\n* <tt>.pem</tt> \u2013 ([[Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail]]) [[Base64]] encoded [[Distinguished Encoding Rules|DER]] certificate, enclosed between \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\" and \"-----END CERTIFICATE-----\"\n* <tt>.cer</tt>, <tt>.crt</tt>, <tt>.der</tt> \u2013 usually in binary [[Distinguished Encoding Rules|DER]] form, but Base64-encoded certificates are common too (see <tt>.pem</tt> above)\n* <tt>.p7b</tt>, <tt>.p7c</tt> \u2013 [[PKCS7|PKCS#7]] SignedData structure without data, just certificate(s) or [[revocation list|CRL]](s)\n* <tt>.p12</tt> \u2013 [[PKCS12|PKCS#12]], may contain certificate(s) (public) and private keys (password protected)\n* <tt>.pfx</tt> \u2013 PFX, predecessor of PKCS#12 (usually contains data in PKCS#12 format, e.g., with PFX files generated in [[Internet Information Services|IIS]])\n\n[[PKCS7|PKCS#7]] is a standard for signing or encrypting (officially called \"enveloping\") data. Since the certificate is needed to verify signed data, it is possible to include them in the SignedData structure. A <tt>.P7C</tt> file is a degenerated SignedData structure, without any data to sign.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n[[PKCS12|PKCS#12]] evolved from the ''personal information exchange'' (PFX) standard and is used to exchange public and private objects in a single file.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Certificate chains and cross-certification==\nA '''certificate chain''' (see the equivalent concept of \"certification path\" defined by RFC 5280)<ref name =\"RFC 5280 Certification Path Validation\">{{cite book\n  | title = Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile\n  | publisher = Network Working Group\n  | year = 2008\n  | section = Certification Path Validation \n  | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#page-71\n}}</ref> is a list of certificates (usually starting with an end-entity certificate) followed by one or more [[Certificate authority|CA]] certificates (usually the last one being a self-signed certificate), with the following properties:\n# The Issuer of each certificate (except the last one) matches the Subject of the next certificate in the list.\n# Each certificate (except the last one) is supposed to be signed by the secret key corresponding to the next certificate in the chain (i.e. the signature of one certificate can be verified using the public key contained in the following certificate).\n# The last certificate in the list is a [[trust anchor]]: a certificate that you trust because it was delivered to you by some trustworthy procedure.\n\nCertificate chains are used in order to check that the public key (PK) contained in a target certificate (the first certificate in the chain) and other data contained in it effectively belongs to its subject. In order to ascertain this, the signature on the target certificate is verified by using the PK contained in the following certificate, whose signature is verified using the next certificate, and so on until the last certificate in the chain is reached. As the last certificate is a trust anchor, successfully reaching it will prove that the target certificate can be trusted.\n\nThe description in the preceding paragraph is a simplified view on the [[certification path validation algorithm|certification path validation process]] as defined by RFC 5280,<ref name=\"RFC 5280 Certification Path Validation\"/> which involves additional checks, such as verifying validity dates on certificates, looking up [[revocation list|CRLs]], etc.\n\n[[File:Cross-certification diagram.svg|thumb|350px|right|Example 1: Cross-certification between two PKIs]]\n[[File:CA certificate renewal.png|frame|right|Example 2: CA certificate renewal]]\n\nExamining how certificate chains are built and validated, it is important to note that a concrete certificate can be part of very different certificate chains (all of them valid). This is because several CA certificates can be generated for the same subject and public key, but be signed with different private keys (from different CAs or different private keys from the same CA). So, although a single X.509 certificate can have only one issuer and one CA signature, it can be validly linked to more than one certificate, building completely different certificate chains. This is crucial for cross-certification between PKIs and other applications.<ref name=\"Understanding Certification Path Construction\">\n{{cite book\n  |title=Understanding Certification Path Construction\n  |date=September 2002\n  |publisher=PKI Forum\n  |last=Lloyd\n  |first=Steve\n  |url=http://www.oasis-pki.org/pdfs/Understanding_Path_construction-DS2.pdf\n}}\n</ref>\nSee the following examples.\n\nIn these diagrams:\n* Each box represents a certificate, with its Subject in bold.\n* A \u2192 B means \"A is signed by B\" (or, more precisely, \"A is signed by the secret key corresponding to the public key contained in B\"). \n* Certificates with the same color (that are not white/transparent) contain the same public key.\n\n===Example 1: Cross-certification at root Certification Authority (CA) level between two PKIs===\n\nIn order to manage that user certificates existing in PKI 2 (like \"User 2\") are trusted by PKI 1, CA1 generates a certificate (cert2.1) containing the public key of CA2.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |title=Qualified Subordination Deployment Scenarios\n  |date=August 2009\n  |publisher=Microsoft\n  |section=Cross-Certification Between Root CAs\n  |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc785267(v=ws.10).aspx\n}}\n</ref>\nNow both \"cert2 and cert2.1 (in green) have the same subject and public key, so there are two valid chains for cert2.2 (User 2): \"cert2.2 \u2192 cert2\" and \"cert2.2 \u2192 cert2.1 \u2192 cert1\".\n\nSimilarly, CA2 can generate a certificate (cert1.1) containing the public key of CA1 so that user certificates existing in PKI 1 (like \"User 1\") are trusted by PKI 2.\n\n===Example 2: CA certificate renewal===\n{{cite book\n  |title=Understanding Certification Path Construction\n  |date=September 2002\n  |publisher=PKI Forum\n  |url=http://www.oasis-pki.org/pdfs/Understanding_Path_construction-DS2.pdf \n  |quote=To allow for graceful transition from the old signing key pair to the new signing key pair, the CA should issue a certificate that contains the old public key signed by the new private signing key and a certificate that contains the new public key signed by the old private signing key.

This allows that old user certificates (such as cert5) and new certificates (such as cert6) can be trusted indifferently by a party having either the new root CA certificate or the old one as trust anchor during the transition to the new CA keys.<ref name=\" PKI Implementing and Managing E-Security\">\n{{cite book\n  |title=PKI: Implementing and Managing E-Security\n  |year=2001\n  |publisher=RSA Press - Osborne/McGraw-Hill\n  |last1=Nash\n  |last2=Duane\n  |last3=Joseph\n  |last4=Brink\n  |isbn=0-07-213123-3\n  |section=Key and Certificate Life Cycles.

So most clients do trust certificates when CRLs are not available, but in that case an attacker that controls the communication channel can disable the CRLs.  Adam Langley of Google has said soft-fail CRL checks are like a safety belt that works except when you have an accident.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Langley|first1=Adam|title=Revocation checking and Chrome's CRL (05 Feb 2012)|url=https://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/02/05/crlsets.html|website=Imperial Violet|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n*CRLs are notably a poor choice because of large sizes and convoluted distribution patterns,\n*Ambiguous OCSP semantics and lack of historical revocation status,\n*Revocation of root certificates is not addressed,\n*'''Aggregation problem''': Identity claims (authenticate with an identifier), attribute claims (submit a bag of vetted attributes), and policy claims are combined in a single container. This raises privacy, policy mapping, and maintenance issues.{{clarify|date=March 2018}}\n*'''Delegation problem''': CAs cannot technically restrict subordinate CAs from issuing certificates outside a limited namespaces or attribute set; this feature of X.509 is not in use. Therefore, a large number of CAs exist on the Internet, and classifying them and their policies is an insurmountable task. Delegation of authority within an organization cannot be handled at all, as in common business practice.\n*'''Federation problem''': Certificate chains that are the result of subordinate CAs, bridge CAs, and cross-signing make validation complex and expensive in terms of processing time. Path validation semantics may be ambiguous. The hierarchy with a third-party trusted party is the only model. This is inconvenient when a bilateral trust relationship is already in place.\n*Issuance of an [[Extended Validation Certificate|Extended Validation (EV) certificate]] for a hostname doesn't prevent issuance of a lower-validation certificate valid for the same hostname, which means that the higher validation level of EV doesn't protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.<ref>[https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-09/SOTIROV/BHUSA09-Sotirov-AttackExtSSL-PAPER.pdf Zusman and Sotirov Blackhat 2009]</ref>\n\n===Problems with certificate authorities===\n* The subject, not the relying party, purchases certificates. The subject will often utilize the cheapest issuer, so quality is not being paid for in the competing market. This is partly addressed by [[Extended Validation]] certificates, yet trust value in the eyes of security experts are diminishing. <ref name=\"troyhuntevcertsdead\">{{cite web|last1=Hunt|first1=Troy|title=Extended Validation Certificates are Dead|url=https://www.troyhunt.com/extended-validation-certificates-are-dead/|website=TroyHunt.com|accessdate=26 February 2019|ref=troyhuntevcertsdead}}</ref>\n* Certification authorities deny almost all warranties to the user (including subject or even relying parties).\n* \"Users use an undefined certification request protocol to obtain a certificate which is published in an unclear location in a nonexistent directory with no real means to revoke it.\"<ref name=\"gutmann1\"/>\n* Like all businesses, CAs are subject to the legal jurisdictions they operate within, and may be legally compelled to compromise the interests of their customers and their users. Intelligence agencies have also made use of false certificates issued through extralegal compromise of CAs, such as [[DigiNotar]], to carry out [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Another example is a revocation request of the CA of the Dutch government, because of a new Dutch law becoming active starting January 1, 2018, giving new powers for the Dutch intelligence and security services.<ref name=\"van Pelt\">{{cite web|last1=van Pelt|first1=Cris|title=Logius: Dutch Government CA trust issue|url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1408647|website=Bugzilla|accessdate=31 October 2017|ref=vanPelt}}</ref>\n\n===Implementation issues===\nImplementations suffer from design flaws, bugs, different interpretations of standards and lack of interoperability of different standards.

And define \"crash.\"|date=March 2018}}\n* Unspecified length of attributes lead to product-specific limits\n* There are implementation errors with X.509 that allow e.g. falsified subject names using null-terminated strings<ref>[https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-09/MARLINSPIKE/BHUSA09-Marlinspike-DefeatSSL-SLIDES.pdf Marlinspike Blackhat 2009]</ref> or code injection attacks in certificates.\n* By using illegal<ref>Rec. ITU-T X.690, clause 8.19.2</ref> 0x80 padded subidentifiers of [[object identifier]]s, wrong implementations or by using integer overflows of the client's browsers, an attacker can include an unknown attribute in the CSR, which the CA will sign, which the client wrongly interprets as \"CN\" (OID=2.5.4.3). Dan Kaminsky at the 26th  [[Chaos Communication Congress]] \"Black OPs of PKI\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan/events/3658.en.html|title=26C3: Black Ops Of PKI|date=|publisher=Events.ccc.de|accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref>\n\n===Cryptographic weaknesses===\nDigital signature systems depend on secure [[cryptographic hash function]]s to work. When a public key infrastructure allows the use of a hash function that is no longer secure, an attacker can exploit weaknesses in the hash function to forge certificates. Specifically, if an attacker is able to produce a [[Collision resistance|hash collision]], they can convince a CA to sign a certificate with innocuous contents, where the hash of those contents is identical to the hash of another, malicious set of certificate contents, created by the attacker with values of their choosing. The attacker can then append the CA-provided signature to their malicious certificate contents, resulting in a malicious certificate that appears to be signed by the CA. Because the malicious certificate contents are chosen solely by the attacker, they can have different validity dates or hostnames than the innocuous certificate. The malicious certificate can even contain a \"CA: true\" field making it able to issue further trusted certificates.\n* MD2-based certificates were used for a long time and were vulnerable to [[preimage attack]]s. Since the root certificate already had a self-signature, attackers could use this signature and use it for an intermediate certificate.\n* In 2005, [[Arjen Lenstra]] and [[Benne de Weger]] demonstrated \"how to use hash collisions to construct two X.509 certificates that contain identical signatures and that differ only in the public keys\", achieved using a [[collision attack]] on the [[MD5]] hash function.<ref name=\"Lenstra & de Weger\">{{cite techreport |first1=Arjen |last1=Lenstra |authorlink1=Arjen Lenstra |first2=Benne |last2=de Weger  |title=On the possibility of constructing meaningful hash collisions for public keys |url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~bdeweger/CollidingCertificates/ddl-full.pdf |accessdate=2013-09-28 |date=2005-05-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514200135/http://www.win.tue.nl/~bdeweger/CollidingCertificates/ddl-full.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-14 |url-status=live |location=Murray Hill, NJ, USA & Eindhoven, The Netherlands |publisher=[[Lucent Technologies]], [[Bell Laboratories]] & [[Technische Universiteit Eindhoven]]}}</ref>\n* In 2008, [[Alexander Sotirov]] and [[Marc Stevens (computer scientist)|Marc Stevens]] presented at the [[Chaos Communication Congress]] a practical attack that allowed them to create a rogue Certificate Authority, accepted by all common browsers, by exploiting the fact that RapidSSL was still issuing X.509 certificates based on MD5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/ |title=MD5 considered harmful today |publisher=Win.tue.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref>\n* In April 2009 at the Eurocrypt Conference,<ref>[https://www.iacr.org/conferences/eurocrypt2009/ Eurocrypt Conference]</ref> Australian Researchers of Macquarie University presented \"Automatic Differential Path Searching for [[SHA-1]]\".<ref>[http://eurocrypt2009rump.cr.yp.to/837a0a8086fa6ca714249409ddfae43d.pdf \"Automatic Differential Path Searching for SHA-1\"]</ref> The researchers were able to deduce a method which increases the likelihood of a collision by several orders of magnitude.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Litke|first1=Pat|title=SHA-1 Collision Attacks Now 252 |url=https://www.secureworks.com/blog/research-20935|website=SecureWorks|publisher=SecureWorks Insights|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref>\n* In February 2017, a group of researchers led by Marc Stevens produced a  SHA-1 collision, demonstrating SHA-1's weakness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shattered.io/static/shattered.pdf|title=The first collision for full SHA-1}}</ref>\n\n==== Mitigations for cryptographic weaknesses ====\nExploiting a hash collision to forge X.509 signatures requires that the attacker be able to predict the data that the certificate authority will sign.

Opened on {{Start date|1925|10|16|df=y}},{{sfn |Joyce |King |Newman |1986 |p=159}}<ref name=\"Short\"/> it gradually replaced [[Southend-on-Sea Corporation Tramways]].\n\n==History==\n{{Southend-on-Sea Trolleybus RDT}}\nSouthend-on-Sea Corporation had operated a tramway system in the town and surrounding districts since 1901, which had been steadily extended to cover {{convert|9.22|mi|km}} by 1914. The town also became a county borough in 1914. The tramways had been authorised by a succession of [[Light Railways Act 1896|Light Railway Orders]],{{sfn |Turner |1996 |pp=138-139}} and was managed by a Light Railways Committee. Once [[World War I]] was over, the committee looked at ways to meet the transport needs of the increasing number of residents and visitors to the seaside town in the early 1920s. The considered building tramways on reserved rights-of-way, and the introduction of trolleybuses. There was a particular need to improve the service between Victoria Circus and [[Prittlewell]], which was provided by a single track tramway. A report was submitted by the electrical engineer in 1923, and members of the Committee visited [[Trolleybuses in Birmingham|Birmingham]],{{sfn |Joyce |King |Newman |1986 |p=136}} where a trolleybus system had begun operating on 27 November 1922.{{sfn |Joyce |King |Newman |1986 |p=26}}\n\nThe committee were sufficiently impressed by the Birmingham system, that they decided to supplement the trams on the service to Prittlewell with trolleybuses, for a trial period of 12 months. They contacted the Railless Electric Traction Company of [[Leeds]], who agreed to provide two trolleybuses on loan, and to erect the overhead wiring. This incorporated a turning circle at Victoria Circus, and a reversing triangle at West Street in Prittlewell. The vehicles supplied had a single deck built on a low chassis with a central entrance. They were fitted with a {{convert|35|hp|kW|abbr=on}} motor supplied by [[Dick, Kerr & Co]], and a cam controller operated by a foot pedal, manufactured by [[English Electric]]. They were similar in design to vehicles supplied to [[Trolleybuses in Ashton-under-Lyne|Ashton-under-Lyne]] and [[Trolleybuses in Hartlepool|West Hartlepool]], but had an open drivers cab, which gave them a neater appearance. Operation on the Prittlewell route began on 16 October 1925.{{sfn |Joyce |King |Newman |1986 |pp=136-137}}\n\nThe experiment was deemed to be a success, and the Corporation bought the two vehicles from Railless. Trams ceased to be used on the Prittlewell route from 4 March 1927, and the fleet of trolleybuses was expanded by buying an [[Associated Equipment Company]] single deck vehicle which had previously run in [[Trolleybuses in Leeds|Leeds]], together with the first double deck vehicle, which was obtained from [[Richard Garrett & Sons]] of [[Leiston]], Suffolk. The Prittlewell route was extended to [[Priory Park, Southend-on-Sea|Priory Park]] in early 1929.

Opened on {{Start date|1925|10|16|df=y}},{{sfn |Joyce |King |Newman |1986 |p=159}}<ref name=\"Short\"/> it gradually replaced [[Southend-on-Sea Corporation Tramways]].\n\n==History==\n{{Southen-on-Sea Trolleybus RDT}}\nSouthend-on-Sea Corporation had operated a tramway system in the town and surrounding districts since 1901, which had been steadily extended to cover {{convert|9.22|mi|km}} by 1914. The town also became a county borough in 1914. The tramways had been authorised by a succession of [[Light Railways Act 1896|Light Railway Orders]],{{sfn |Turner |1996 |pp=138-139}} and was managed by a Light Railways Committee. Once [[World War I]] was over, the committee looked at ways to meet the transport needs of the increasing number of residents and visitors to the seaside town in the early 1920s. The considered building tramways on reserved rights-of-way, and the introduction of trolleybuses. There was a particular need to improve the service between Victoria Circus and [[Prittlewell]], which was provided by a single track tramway. A report was submitted by the electrical engineer in 1923, and members of the Committee visited [[Trolleybuses in Birmingham|Birmingham]],{{sfn |Joyce |King |Newman |1986 |p=136}} where a trolleybus system had begun operating on 27 November 1922.{{sfn |Joyce |King |Newman |1986 |p=26}}\n\nThe committee were sufficiently impressed by the Birmingham system, that they decided to supplement the trams on the service to Prittlewell with trolleybuses, for a trial period of 12 months. They contacted the Railless Electric Traction Company of [[Leeds]], who agreed to provide two trolleybuses on loan, and to erect the overhead wiring. This incorporated a turning circle at Victoria Circus, and a reversing triangle at West Street in Prittlewell. The vehicles supplied had a single deck built on a low chassis with a central entrance. They were fitted with a {{convert|35|hp|kW|abbr=on}} motor supplied by [[Dick, Kerr & Co]], and a cam controller operated by a foot pedal, manufactured by [[English Electric]]. They were similar in design to vehicles supplied to [[Trolleybuses in Ashton-under-Lyne|Ashton-under-Lyne]] and [[Trolleybuses in Hartlepool|West Hartlepool]], but had an open drivers cab, which gave them a neater appearance. Operation on the Prittlewell route began on 16 October 1925.{{sfn |Joyce |King |Newman |1986 |pp=136-137}}\n\nThe experiment was deemed to be a success, and the Corporation bought the two vehicles from Railless. Trams ceased to be used on the Prittlewell route from 4 March 1927, and the fleet of trolleybuses was expanded by buying an [[Associated Equipment Company]] single deck vehicle which had previously run in [[Trolleybuses in Leeds|Leeds]], together with the first double deck vehicle, which was obtained from [[Richard Garrett & Sons]] of [[Leiston]], Suffolk. The Prittlewell route was extended to [[Priory Park, Southend-on-Sea|Priory Park]] in early 1929. A route to the seafront was also planned, which would follow roads where there was no tramway service. It ran along White Gate Road to Bankside and opened on 12 December 1928.

It stars [[Brie Larson]] as a woman who has been held captive for seven years and whose 5-year-old son ([[Jacob Tremblay]]) was born in captivity. Their escape allows the boy to experience the outside world for the first time. The film also stars [[Joan Allen]], [[Sean Bridgers]], and [[William H. Macy]].\n\nThe film was a co-production of Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States and was shot in [[Toronto]], with the eponymous set built at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]]. The crew designed each part of the set for the room to be removable to provide access for the crew. Larson researched trauma and nutrition for her part.\n\n''Room'' premiered at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on September 4, 2015, and later screened at the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival]], where it received the People's Choice Award. The film was theatrically released in Canada on October 23, 2015 by [[Elevation Pictures]] and in the United Kingdom and Ireland on January 15, 2016 by [[StudioCanal UK|StudioCanal]]. It began a [[limited release|limited theatrical run]] in the United States on October 16, 2015 by [[A24 (company)|A24]]. ''Room'' received critical acclaim for Larson's and Tremblay's performances and the storytelling, and grossed $36.3 million on a $13 million budget.\n\nCited as one of the best films of the year, [[List of accolades received by Room|''Room'' received numerous awards and nominations]]. At the [[88th Academy Awards]], ''Room'' received four nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and winning [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Larson. It also won nine [[4th Canadian Screen Awards|Canadian Screen Awards]], including [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Motion Picture]], and seven [[13th Irish Film & Television Awards|Irish Film & Television Awards]], including Best Film. Larson won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] for Best Actress.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Akron, Ohio]], 24-year-old Joy Newsome and her 5-year-old son Jack live in a squalid shed they call Room. They share a bed, toilet, bathtub, television, and rudimentary kitchen; the only window is a skylight. They are captives of a man they call \"Old Nick\", Jack's biological father, who abducted Joy seven years prior and routinely rapes her while Jack sleeps in the closet. She tries to stay optimistic for her son but suffers from malnutrition and depression. She allows Jack to believe that only Room and its contents are real, and that the rest of the world exists only on television.\n\nOld Nick tells Joy that he has lost his job and threatens that he may not be able to afford their supplies in the future. That night, Jack is overcome with curiosity and ventures out of the closet while Old Nick is asleep in bed with his mother. Joy is horrified when she awakens and sees their interaction, slapping Old Nick away. As punishment, he cuts their heat and power. Joy decides to tell Jack about the outside world; he reacts with disbelief and incomprehension, but also curiosity. She has Jack fake a fever, hoping that Old Nick will take him to a hospital where he can alert the authorities, but Old Nick says he will return the following day with antibiotics.\n\nJoy wraps Jack in a carpet and has him play dead in the hope that Old Nick will remove him from Room. Falling for the ruse, Old Nick places Jack in the back of his pickup truck and drives through a residential neighborhood. Although stunned by his first exposure to the outside world, Jack jumps from the truck and attracts the attention of a passerby. The police arrive and rescue him. The police discover Joy as well, and take her and Jack to a hospital. Old Nick is captured and arrested.\n\nReunited with her family, Joy learns that her parents have divorced and that her mother has a new partner, Leo. She returns with Jack to her childhood home where her mother and Leo reside. Her father cannot accept Jack as his grandchild and leaves. Jack struggles to adjust to life in the larger world, speaking only to his mother and expressing a desire to return to Room. Joy struggles with anger and depression, lashing out at her mother and becoming worried about Jack's lack of interaction with \"real\" things. At the suggestion of the family's lawyer, Joy agrees to a television interview, but becomes upset when the interviewer questions her decision to keep the newborn Jack instead of asking Old Nick to take him to a hospital. Overwhelmed with guilt, she attempts suicide; Jack finds her unconscious in the bathroom, and she is admitted to a hospital.\n\nJack misses his mother but begins to settle into his new life. He bonds with his new family, meets Leo's dog, Seamus, and makes friends with a boy his age. Believing his long hair will give Joy the strength she needs to recover, Jack has his grandmother cut it for him so he can send it to her. Joy returns home and apologizes, thanking Jack for saving her life again. At Jack's request, they visit Room one last time, escorted by police. Jack is confused; he feels it has shrunk and that it is a different place with the door open. He and Joy say their goodbyes to Room and leave.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Brie Larson]] as Joy \"Ma\" Newsome\n* [[Jacob Tremblay]] as Jack Newsome\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Nancy Newsome\n* [[William H.

Macy]].\n\nThe film was a co-production of Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States and was shot in [[Toronto]], with the eponymous set built at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]].

Larson won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] for Best Actress.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Akron, Ohio]], 24-year-old Joy Newsome and her 5-year-old son Jack live in a squalid shed they call Room. They share a bed, toilet, bathtub, television, and rudimentary kitchen; the only window is a skylight. They are captives of a man they call \"Old Nick\", Jack's biological father, who abducted Joy seven years prior and routinely rapes her while Jack sleeps in the closet. She tries to stay optimistic for her son but suffers from malnutrition and depression. She allows Jack to believe that only Room and its contents are real, and that the rest of the world exists only on television.\n\nOld Nick tells Joy that he has lost his job and threatens that he may not be able to afford their supplies in the future. That night, Jack is overcome with curiosity and ventures out of the closet while Old Nick is asleep in bed with his mother. Joy is horrified when she awakens and sees their interaction, slapping Old Nick away. As punishment, he cuts their heat and power. Joy decides to tell Jack about the outside world; he reacts with disbelief and incomprehension, but also curiosity. She has Jack fake a fever, hoping that Old Nick will take him to a hospital where he can alert the authorities, but Old Nick says he will return the following day with antibiotics.\n\nJoy wraps Jack in a carpet and has him play dead in the hope that Old Nick will remove him from Room. Falling for the ruse, Old Nick places Jack in the back of his pickup truck and drives through a residential neighborhood. Although stunned by his first exposure to the outside world, Jack jumps from the truck and attracts the attention of a passerby. The police arrive and rescue him. The police discover Joy as well, and take her and Jack to a hospital. Old Nick is captured and arrested.\n\nReunited with her family, Joy learns that her parents have divorced and that her mother has a new partner, Leo. She returns with Jack to her childhood home where her mother and Leo reside. Her father cannot accept Jack as his grandchild and leaves. Jack struggles to adjust to life in the larger world, speaking only to his mother and expressing a desire to return to Room. Joy struggles with anger and depression, lashing out at her mother and becoming worried about Jack's lack of interaction with \"real\" things. At the suggestion of the family's lawyer, Joy agrees to a television interview, but becomes upset when the interviewer questions her decision to keep the newborn Jack instead of asking Old Nick to take him to a hospital. Overwhelmed with guilt, she attempts suicide; Jack finds her unconscious in the bathroom, and she is admitted to a hospital.\n\nJack misses his mother but begins to settle into his new life. He bonds with his new family, meets Leo's dog, Seamus, and makes friends with a boy his age. Believing his long hair will give Joy the strength she needs to recover, Jack has his grandmother cut it for him so he can send it to her. Joy returns home and apologizes, thanking Jack for saving her life again. At Jack's request, they visit Room one last time, escorted by police. Jack is confused; he feels it has shrunk and that it is a different place with the door open. He and Joy say their goodbyes to Room and leave.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Brie Larson]] as Joy \"Ma\" Newsome\n* [[Jacob Tremblay]] as Jack Newsome\n* [[Joan Allen]] as Nancy Newsome\n* [[William H.
