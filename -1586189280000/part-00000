Emo comes by to help Mirai who was upset about not getting a signature from Anna. She asks Mirai to help become Idols together to take down Anna and she was speaking so loud a baby cried.

Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances.\n\nSome such bands form on their own. They can evolve out of church choral or [[gospel music]] groups, but are often created by [[talent manager]]s or record producers who hold auditions. Due to this and their general commercial orientation towards a female audience of [[preteen]]s, [[teenybopper]]s, or teens, the term may be used with negative connotations in [[music journalism]]. Boy bands are similar in concept to their counterparts, [[girl group]]s. Boy bands' popularity peaked four times: in the 1960s (e.g., [[The Jackson 5]]), in the 1990s and early 2000s when acts such as the [[Backstreet Boys]], [[NSYNC|*NSYNC]], [[A1 (band)|A1]] and [[Westlife]], among others, dominated the top of the ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' and pop charts, in the early 2010s with the emergence of new boy bands such as [[JLS]], [[Big Time Rush (band)|Big Time Rush]] and [[One Direction]], and in the late 2010s with pop groups such as [[BTS (band)|BTS]] and [[Brockhampton (band)|Brockhampton]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe earliest forerunner of boy band music began in the late 19th century as [[a cappella]] [[barbershop quartets]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barbershop.org/web/groups/public/documents/pages/pub_cb_00016.hcsp |title=Definition of the Barbershop Style, from the Contest and Judging Handbook |date=July 11, 2002 |accessdate=June 6, 2007 |publisher=Barbershop Harmony Society |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607170531/http://www.barbershop.org/web/groups/public/documents/pages/pub_cb_00016.hcsp |archivedate=June 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> They were usually a group of males and sang in [[Four-part harmony|four-part harmonies]]. Barbershop quartets were popular into the earlier part of the 20th century. A revival of the male vocal group took place in the late 1940s and 1950s with the use of [[doo-wop]] music. Doo-wop bands sang about topics such as love and other themes used in [[pop music]]. The earliest traces of boy bands were in the mid-1950s although the term boy band was not used.

For instance, their music featured [[close harmony|close harmonies]] from [[soul music]] and catchy pop hooks influenced as much as they were by [[Motown]] and acts like [[the Supremes]]. The group also incorporated choreographed dance moves to their performances. All members of the band sang, which is a common convention of a boy band, as opposed to having a front man and the rest on instruments; thus, no one person dominated the stage.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Also a siblings group, The Osmonds first started singing [[barbershop music]] for local audiences, before being hired to perform at [[Disneyland]] early in their career. Their appearance in a televised Disney special earned them additional TV spots, such as ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'' and ''[[The Jerry Lewis Show]]''.<ref name=\"THR\"/>\n\n===Late 1970s and 1980s: Menudo, New Edition, and New Kids on the Block===\nOther antecedents (apart from those already mentioned) exist throughout the history of pop music. The genre has been copied into languages and cultures other than the Anglo-American. The Puerto Rican boy band [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], appealing to young [[Latino (demonym)|Latina]] audiences, was founded in 1977. Menudo had a convention unique among boy bands: when a member turned 16, became too tall, or their voice changed, they were replaced.  The members of Menudo were generally aged 12\u201316.\n\nThe [[Bay City Rollers]] were a [[Scotland|Scottish]] pop band who were most popular in the mid-1970s. The ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' noted that they were \"[[tartan]] teen sensations from [[Edinburgh]]\", and were \"the first of many acts heralded as the 'Biggest Group since [[The Beatles]]' and one of the most screamed-at teeny-bopper acts of the 1970s\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums|edition= 19th|publisher= Guinness World Records |location= London|isbn= 1-904994-10-5|page = 45}}</ref>  For a fairly brief but fervent period (nicknamed \"Rollermania\"), they were worldwide [[teen idol]]s.  The group were one of the first bands, like The Monkees before them, to take the formula shown by The Beatles and apply it to a teen market. The group achieved the same amount of success but for a limited period of time. At the peak of their popularity in the UK, comparisons were being made to The Beatles. Also by this time, Bay City Roller [[fan (person)|fans]] had a completely distinctive style of dress, the main elements of which were ankle-length [[tartan]] trousers and tartan [[scarf|scarves]], the group using the benefit of merchandise and promotion.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book| first= Martin C | last = Strong| year = 2000| title = The Great Rock Discography | edition = 5th|publisher= Mojo |location= Edinburgh|pages= 2\u20133|isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\nThe German boy band ''The Teens'' formed in [[West Berlin]] [[1976]] and had a couple of hits targeting young females.

[[Maurice Starr]] was influenced by New Edition and popularized it with his [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] [[New Kids on the Block]], the first commercially successful modern boy band, who formed in 1984 and found international success in 1988. Starr's idea was to take the traditional template from the R&B genre (in this case his teenage band New Edition) and apply it to a pop genre.\n\n[[Bros]] (abbreviation of the word \"brothers\") were a British boy band active in the late 1980s and early 1990s, consisting of twin brothers [[Matt Goss|Matt]] and [[Luke Goss]] along with [[Craig Logan]]. Formed in 1986, they scored multiple top 10 hits between 1987 and 1989 and in 1988 became the first modern era\u2013style boy band to have a multiple platinum-selling album in the UK, with ''[[Push (Bros album)|Push]]'', still one of the most successful boy-band albums in the UK. Other big boy bands in Britain during the late 1980s were [[Big Fun (boyband)|Big Fun]] and [[Brother Beyond]].\n\n===1990s: Boyz II Men, Take That, Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Westlife===\n\n[[File:Take That London Olympics 2012. by Rory.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Take That]] performing \u201c[[Rule the World (Take That song)|Rule the World]]\u201d at the [[2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|2012 Olympic Games closing ceremony]] in London]]\nSome managers in Europe soon created their own acts after being inspired by New Kids on the Block, beginning with [[Nigel Martin-Smith]]'s [[Take That]] in the UK (formed in 1990) and followed by [[Tom Watkins (music manager)|Tom Watkins]], who had success with [[Bros]] in the late 1980s and formed [[East 17]] in 1991. Bros were marketed and pitted against Take That as rivals with a harsher attitude, style and sound. Since reforming in 2006 after a decade-long hiatus, Take That have become one of the most successful groups in British music chart history and their albums and singles have also charted internationally, especially in Europe. Irish music manager [[Louis Walsh]], who had witnessed the impact of these British boy bands, put out an advert for an \"Irish Take That\", thereby creating [[Boyzone]] in 1993. [[Let Loose]] (formed in 1993), [[MN8]] and [[911 (UK band)|911]] (formed in 1995), and [[Damage (British band)|Damage]] (formed in 1996) were also successful boy bands in Britain; however, by the late 1990s all these bands had run their course and split up.\n\nAll these artists were very successful on both the singles and albums charts domestically and internationally; however, with the emergence of [[Britpop]] and the commercial co-option of [[indie rock]], many boy bands were ridiculed by the British music press as having no artistic credibility, although some, such as East 17 and Take That, did write most of their own material. The media attention was then placed on the \"Battle of Britpop\", and the bands [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]] replaced the importance and rivalry of Take That and East 17 as the two new biggest bands in Britain. However, boy bands continued to find success in the late 1990s, such as [[Five (band)|Five]], [[Another Level (band)|Another Level]], [[Point Break (band)|Point Break]] and [[Westlife]]. In 1995 successful German music manager [[Frank Farian]], who had been manager of [[Boney M]] and [[Milli Vanilli]], put together [[Latin American]] band [[No Mercy (pop band)|No Mercy]] who scored a few worldwide hits during the mid-90s.\n\nAlthough being American and the sons of [[Tito Jackson]], a member of [[The Jackson 5]], [[3T]] had several hits singles across Europe in the mid-1990s, despite limited success in the US, and finished the second biggest selling act of 1996 in Europe behind the [[Spice Girls]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.sortmusic.com/_0/3t-biography,len.html |title=3T Biography |publisher=Sort music |accessdate=August 5, 2012}}</ref> With the success of North American boy bands like [[New Kids on the Block]] in East Asia, Japanese entertainment company [[Johnny & Associates]] formed [[SMAP]] in 1992.

Continuing this success in the mid-1990s, most prominent boy bands were African American and had R&B and gospel elements, such as the groups [[All-4-One]] (formed in 1993) and [[Boyz II Men]] (formed in 1988). Boyz II Men are also the most successful boy band act on the [[U.S. Hot 100]] as well as the [[Australian Singles Chart]]. Although they had success on the Billboard charts, they were not marketed towards youth but more towards adults. It was not until 1997 and the change to pop-oriented groups such as [[Backstreet Boys]], [[98 Degrees]], [[NSYNC]], [[The Moffatts]], and [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] that boy bands exploded commercially and dominated the market in the United States. This late 1990s marked the height of boy band popularity in North America, which has not been seen since.\n\nArguably the most successful boy band manager from the U.S. was [[Lou Pearlman]], who founded commercially successful acts such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] in 1993, [[NSYNC]] and [[LFO (group)|LFO]] in 1995, [[O-Town (band)|O-Town]] in 2000, and [[US5]] in 2005. Backstreet Boys and NSYNC became the two biggest boy bands in the late 1990s until the early 2000s, and Backstreet Boys went on to tie [[The Jackson 5]] as the best-selling boy bands in history with over 100 million records sold.<ref name=\"bsb\"/>\n\nIn the late 1990s in the UK, producer [[Simon Cowell]] (noted in the U.S. for the ''American Idol/X Factor'' franchise) is also known for having managed British boyband [[Five (band)|Five]] (formed in 1997) and Irish boyband [[Westlife]] (formed in 1998). Westlife was created by Irishman [[Louis Walsh]] as a replacement for [[Boyzone]]<ref>{{cite web| url = http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/x-factor/judges/louis-walsh.html | work = Press Association | title = Louis Walsh Profile | publisher= Yahoo! |accessdate= January 9, 2010}}</ref> and was initially managed by a former member of the band [[Ronan Keating]]. Westlife would eventually overtake Take That in number one's tally in the UK although Take That's overall UK sales are still higher. In 2012, the [[Official Charts Company]] revealed the biggest selling singles artists in British music chart history with Take That placed 15th overall and the highest selling boyband act (9.3 million), followed by Boyzone at 29 (7.1 million) and Westlife at 34 (6.8 million).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-20-biggest-selling-groups-of-all-time-revealed-1682/ | title = The Official Top 20 biggest selling groups of all time revealed!|publisher=Official charts |accessdate=November 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-singles-charts-biggest-selling-artists-of-all-time-revealed-1431/ |title=Official Singles Charts' biggest selling artists of all time revealed | publisher =Official charts |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/take-thats-top-40-biggest-selling-songs-3313/ | title = Take That's Top 40 Biggest Selling Songs|publisher=Official charts |accessdate=November 29, 2014}}</ref> Even though Cowell is known to have managed several successful boy bands, he is also infamous for passing on signing two of the biggest boybands to emerge from the 1990s and 2000s, Take That and [[Busted (band)|Busted]].<ref>{{cite news| first =Alasdair | last = Glennie |url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2118414/Simon-Cowell-admits-turned-Take-That-overweight-Gary-Barlow.html | title =Simon Cowell admits that he turned down Take That because of 'overweight' Gary Barlow |work=Daily Mail |date = March 22, 2012 |accessdate=June 29, 2012 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bebo.com/BlogView.jsp?MemberId=7322368642&BlogId=7651779757 |title=Blog |publisher=Bebo |accessdate=June 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915184945/https://bebo.com/BlogView.jsp?MemberId=7322368642&BlogId=7651779757 |archive-date=September 15, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===2000s: Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, Westlife, Jonas Brothers and F4===\n[[File:JonasBrothers.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jonas Brothers]] are described as pop boy band]]\nWith the continued success of [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[NSYNC|*NSYNC]], American and British groups like [[98 Degrees]], [[Westlife]], [[O-Town (band)|O-Town]], [[A1 (band)|A1]], [[Blue (English band)|Blue]], and [[Busted (band)|Busted]] gained quick popularity both domestically and internationally.

The key factor of a boy band is being trendy. This means that the band conforms to the most recent fashion and musical trends in the popular music scene. Typically, each member of the group will have some distinguishing feature and be portrayed as having a particular personality stereotype, such as \"the baby,\" \"the bad boy,\" or \"the shy one.\"  While managing the portrayal of popular musicians is as old as [[popular music]], the particular pigeonholing of band members is a defining characteristic of boy and girl bands.\n\nIn most cases, their music is written, arranged and produced by a producer who works with the band at all times and controls the group's sound \u2013 if necessary, to the point of hiring [[session singers]] to record guide vocals for each member of the group to sing individually if the members cannot harmonize well together. However, for clarity of each voice, recording each voice individually is most commonly the norm with most modern vocal groups.  In recent years [[auto-tune]] has become a popular tool for boy bands who are unable to sing to a high standard. Some boy bands have come under fire for this issue of using auto-tune. Some have also come under fire for [[lip syncing]] in their performances as well, for example [[New Kids on the Block]].<ref>{{cite news | title = New Kids' Performance Was Dubbed, Critic Says | url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-03-04/news/9203040523_1_mcpherson-new-kids-starr |newspaper = Orlando Sentinel | accessdate =August 15, 2012|date=March 4, 1992}}</ref>\n\nA typical boy band performance features elaborately choreographed dancing, with the members taking turns singing and/or rapping. Boy bands generally do not compose or produce their own material, unless the members lobby hard enough for creative control. However, some bands were created around the talent of a songwriter within the group like [[Gary Barlow]] of [[Take That]] or [[Tony Mortimer]] of [[East 17]]. It is not uncommon to find extra songs on an album written by one or more of the band members; however, their producers rarely use these as singles.\n\nSince the 21st century, however, boy bands have been expected to write or at least contribute in some part lyrically to songs. Apart from the groups mentioned above who all had at least one primary songwriter from their beginning, other groups soon caught up.  From the late nineties, members of [[Backstreet Boys]] who had previously used writers like [[Max Martin]] during their early albums began writing their own songs. Newer groups from late 2000s such as [[JLS]] have all made a point from early interviews that they write their own songs and hold their own image as this is an important part of marketing. Some bands like [[The Wanted]] have even spent time learning the craft of songwriting.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a329584/the-wanted-go-to-songwriting-camp-to-write-new-album.html |title=The Wanted go to songwriting camp to write new album |work=Digital Spy |date=July 13, 2011 | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIndividuals can also go on to achieve greater success as a solo artist coming out of a boy band having used the groups popularity to build on. Usually this signals the end of the group until potential future reunions. Examples of this include [[Michael Jackson]] from [[The Jackson 5]], [[Donny Osmond]] from [[The Osmonds]], [[Ricky Martin]] from [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], [[Justin Timberlake]] from *NSYNC, and [[Ronan Keating]] from [[Boyzone]]. Sometimes the most successful solo star from a band is not the most popular member such as [[Robbie Williams]] as opposed to lead singer [[Gary Barlow]] from [[Take That]]. Some boy band members have gone on to successful careers elsewhere in the media. [[Michael Dolenz]] of [[The Monkees]] went on to become a successful television producer, working for [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] franchises such as [[LWT]] and [[Television South]].\n\n==Music genres==\nAlthough most boy bands consist of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] or pop influences, other [[music genre]]s, most notably [[country music]] and [[folk music]], are also represented. [[South 65]] and [[Marshall Dyllon]], for example, were both country music boy bands. [[Il Divo]], created by [[Simon Cowell]] in 2004, are a vocal group that performs [[operatic pop]] in several (mainly Italian) languages. Since then operatic/classical boy bands have become quite popular and common, especially in the UK. Since 2001 there has been some crossover with [[power pop]] and [[pop punk]] from bands that play live instruments. Just recently some boy bands decided to go back to their original doo-wop roots, most notably, [[The Overtones]].\n\n==Controversy==\nSince the 2000s, groups such as [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[LFO (group)|LFO]] have disliked the term \"boy band\" and have preferred to be known as a \"male vocal group\".<ref>{{cite web| title = I would be the dessert because I\u2019m satisfying | url = http://www.popjustice.com/interviewsandfeatures/backstreet-boys-interview/49849/|publisher= Pop Justice | accessdate = August 16, 2012|date=October 24, 2007|quote=We were never a boyband.

Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances.\n\nSome such bands form on their own. They can evolve out of church choral or [[gospel music]] groups, but are often created by [[talent manager]]s or record producers who hold auditions. Due to this and their general commercial orientation towards a female audience of [[preteen]]s, [[teenybopper]]s, or teens, the term may be used with negative connotations in [[music journalism]]. Boy bands are similar in concept to their counterparts, [[girl group]]s. Boy bands' popularity peaked four times: in the 1960s (e.g., [[The Jackson 5]]), in the 1990s and early 2000s when acts such as the [[Backstreet Boys]], [[NSYNC|*NSYNC]], [[A1 (band)|A1]] and [[Westlife]], among others, dominated the top of the ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' and pop charts, in the early 2010s with the emergence of new boy bands such as [[JLS]], [[Big Time Rush (band)|Big Time Rush]] and [[One Direction]], and in the late 2010s with pop groups such as [[BTS (band)|BTS]] and [[Brockhampton (band)|Brockhampton]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe earliest forerunner of boy band music began in the late 19th century as [[a cappella]] [[barbershop quartets]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barbershop.org/web/groups/public/documents/pages/pub_cb_00016.hcsp |title=Definition of the Barbershop Style, from the Contest and Judging Handbook |date=July 11, 2002 |accessdate=June 6, 2007 |publisher=Barbershop Harmony Society |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607170531/http://www.barbershop.org/web/groups/public/documents/pages/pub_cb_00016.hcsp |archivedate=June 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> They were usually a group of males and sang in [[Four-part harmony|four-part harmonies]]. Barbershop quartets were popular into the earlier part of the 20th century. A revival of the male vocal group took place in the late 1940s and 1950s with the use of [[doo-wop]] music. Doo-wop bands sang about topics such as love and other themes used in [[pop music]]. The earliest traces of boy bands were in the mid-1950s although the term boy band was not used. [[African American]] vocal group [[The Ink Spots]] was one of the first of what would now be called boy bands. The term boy band was not established until the late 1980s as before that they were called male vocal groups or \"hep harmony singing groups\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://didyouknow.org/boybands/ |title=Boy bands |publisher=Did you know |accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlthough generally described as a rock band, the highest-selling band in history [[The Beatles]] are considered by a number of journalists as \"the first\" or \"the original\" boyband, \"before anyone had thought of the term.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/news/faintings-stage-invasions-how-the-beatles-invented-the-cult-of-f/ |title=Faintings, stage invasions: how the Beatles invented the cult of female fandom |last=Brown |first=Mick |date=September 6, 2016 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=The Liverpool quartet known as [[The Beatles]] were not only the quintessential rock band, but many considered John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Star [''sic''] to be the original boy band \u2013 especially in the early 1960s when young girls would scream at the top of their lungs and pass out upon first sight of the \u201cFab Four.\"|author=''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''<ref name=\"THR\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/boy-bands-wanted-one-direction-nsync-beatles-backstreet-boys-306859/1-the-beatles |title=The Beatles to The Wanted: The Evolution of Boy Bands |last=Medina |first=Portia|last2=Hermon|first2=James|last3=James |first3=Kyleen |date=April 4, 2012 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=March 13, 2018}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Beatles inspired the production of the 1966 television series ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'',<ref name=\"Star Tribune\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.startribune.com/from-beatles-to-the-wanted-a-history-of-boy-bands-at-a-glance/215232031/ |title=From Beatles to the Wanted: A history of boy bands at a glance |last=Tillotson |first=Kristin |date=July 15, 2013 |work=[[Star Tribune]] |access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref> which spawned [[The Monkees|the music group of the same name]], formed by the four starring actors.

For instance, their music featured [[close harmony|close harmonies]] from [[soul music]] and catchy pop hooks influenced as much as they were by [[Motown]] and acts like [[the Supremes]]. The group also incorporated choreographed dance moves to their performances. All members of the band sang, which is a common convention of a boy band, as opposed to having a front man and the rest on instruments; thus, no one person dominated the stage.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Also a siblings group, The Osmonds first started singing [[barbershop music]] for local audiences, before being hired to perform at [[Disneyland]] early in their career. Their appearance in a televised Disney special earned them additional TV spots, such as ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'' and ''[[The Jerry Lewis Show]]''.<ref name=\"THR\"/>\n\n===Late 1970s and 1980s: Menudo, New Edition, and New Kids on the Block===\nOther antecedents (apart from those already mentioned) exist throughout the history of pop music. The genre has been copied into languages and cultures other than the Anglo-American. The Puerto Rican boy band [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], appealing to young [[Latino (demonym)|Latina]] audiences, was founded in 1977. Menudo had a convention unique among boy bands: when a member turned 16, became too tall, or their voice changed, they were replaced.  The members of Menudo were generally aged 12\u201316.\n\nThe [[Bay City Rollers]] were a [[Scotland|Scottish]] pop band who were most popular in the mid-1970s. The ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' noted that they were \"[[tartan]] teen sensations from [[Edinburgh]]\", and were \"the first of many acts heralded as the 'Biggest Group since [[The Beatles]]' and one of the most screamed-at teeny-bopper acts of the 1970s\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums|edition= 19th|publisher= Guinness World Records |location= London|isbn= 1-904994-10-5|page = 45}}</ref>  For a fairly brief but fervent period (nicknamed \"Rollermania\"), they were worldwide [[teen idol]]s.  The group were one of the first bands, like The Monkees before them, to take the formula shown by The Beatles and apply it to a teen market. The group achieved the same amount of success but for a limited period of time. At the peak of their popularity in the UK, comparisons were being made to The Beatles. Also by this time, Bay City Roller [[fan (person)|fans]] had a completely distinctive style of dress, the main elements of which were ankle-length [[tartan]] trousers and tartan [[scarf|scarves]], the group using the benefit of merchandise and promotion.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book| first= Martin C | last = Strong| year = 2000| title = The Great Rock Discography | edition = 5th|publisher= Mojo |location= Edinburgh|pages= 2\u20133|isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\nThe German boy band ''The Teens'' formed in [[West Berlin]] [[1976]] and had a couple of hits targeting young females.

Vocalist [[Eric Carmen]] later commented, \"It was not hip for people to like us, because their little sister liked us.\"<ref>{{Citation | last = Knopper | first = Steve | contribution = Raspberries | title = Contemporary Musicians | publisher = Gale | year = 2004 | series = Encyclopedia | accessdate = December 26, 2009 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/}}</ref>\n\nBoston group [[New Edition]] was formed in 1978 and reached their height of popularity in the 1980s, meaning they are often credited for starting the boy-band trend, even though the term \"boy band\" did not exist until the 1990s. [[Maurice Starr]] was influenced by New Edition and popularized it with his [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] [[New Kids on the Block]], the first commercially successful modern boy band, who formed in 1984 and found international success in 1988. Starr's idea was to take the traditional template from the R&B genre (in this case his teenage band New Edition) and apply it to a pop genre.\n\n[[Bros]] (abbreviation of the word \"brothers\") were a British boy band active in the late 1980s and early 1990s, consisting of twin brothers [[Matt Goss|Matt]] and [[Luke Goss]] along with [[Craig Logan]]. Formed in 1986, they scored multiple top 10 hits between 1987 and 1989 and in 1988 became the first modern era\u2013style boy band to have a multiple platinum-selling album in the UK, with ''[[Push (Bros album)|Push]]'', still one of the most successful boy-band albums in the UK. Other big boy bands in Britain during the late 1980s were [[Big Fun (boyband)|Big Fun]] and [[Brother Beyond]].\n\n===1990s: Boyz II Men, Take That, Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Westlife===\n\n[[File:Take That London Olympics 2012. by Rory.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Take That]] performing \u201c[[Rule the World (Take That song)|Rule the World]]\u201d at the [[2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|2012 Olympic Games closing ceremony]] in London]]\nSome managers in Europe soon created their own acts after being inspired by New Kids on the Block, beginning with [[Nigel Martin-Smith]]'s [[Take That]] in the UK (formed in 1990) and followed by [[Tom Watkins (music manager)|Tom Watkins]], who had success with [[Bros]] in the late 1980s and formed [[East 17]] in 1991. Bros were marketed and pitted against Take That as rivals with a harsher attitude, style and sound. Since reforming in 2006 after a decade-long hiatus, Take That have become one of the most successful groups in British music chart history and their albums and singles have also charted internationally, especially in Europe. Irish music manager [[Louis Walsh]], who had witnessed the impact of these British boy bands, put out an advert for an \"Irish Take That\", thereby creating [[Boyzone]] in 1993. [[Let Loose]] (formed in 1993), [[MN8]] and [[911 (UK band)|911]] (formed in 1995), and [[Damage (British band)|Damage]] (formed in 1996) were also successful boy bands in Britain; however, by the late 1990s all these bands had run their course and split up.\n\nAll these artists were very successful on both the singles and albums charts domestically and internationally; however, with the emergence of [[Britpop]] and the commercial co-option of [[indie rock]], many boy bands were ridiculed by the British music press as having no artistic credibility, although some, such as East 17 and Take That, did write most of their own material. The media attention was then placed on the \"Battle of Britpop\", and the bands [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]] replaced the importance and rivalry of Take That and East 17 as the two new biggest bands in Britain. However, boy bands continued to find success in the late 1990s, such as [[Five (band)|Five]], [[Another Level (band)|Another Level]], [[Point Break (band)|Point Break]] and [[Westlife]]. In 1995 successful German music manager [[Frank Farian]], who had been manager of [[Boney M]] and [[Milli Vanilli]], put together [[Latin American]] band [[No Mercy (pop band)|No Mercy]] who scored a few worldwide hits during the mid-90s.\n\nAlthough being American and the sons of [[Tito Jackson]], a member of [[The Jackson 5]], [[3T]] had several hits singles across Europe in the mid-1990s, despite limited success in the US, and finished the second biggest selling act of 1996 in Europe behind the [[Spice Girls]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.sortmusic.com/_0/3t-biography,len.html |title=3T Biography |publisher=Sort music |accessdate=August 5, 2012}}</ref> With the success of North American boy bands like [[New Kids on the Block]] in East Asia, Japanese entertainment company [[Johnny & Associates]] formed [[SMAP]] in 1992.

Continuing this success in the mid-1990s, most prominent boy bands were African American and had R&B and gospel elements, such as the groups [[All-4-One]] (formed in 1993) and [[Boyz II Men]] (formed in 1988). Boyz II Men are also the most successful boy band act on the [[U.S. Hot 100]] as well as the [[Australian Singles Chart]]. Although they had success on the Billboard charts, they were not marketed towards youth but more towards adults. It was not until 1997 and the change to pop-oriented groups such as [[Backstreet Boys]], [[98 Degrees]], [[NSYNC]], [[The Moffatts]], and [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] that boy bands exploded commercially and dominated the market in the United States. This late 1990s marked the height of boy band popularity in North America, which has not been seen since.\n\nArguably the most successful boy band manager from the U.S. was [[Lou Pearlman]], who founded commercially successful acts such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] in 1993, [[NSYNC]] and [[LFO (group)|LFO]] in 1995, [[O-Town (band)|O-Town]] in 2000, and [[US5]] in 2005. Backstreet Boys and NSYNC became the two biggest boy bands in the late 1990s until the early 2000s, and Backstreet Boys went on to tie [[The Jackson 5]] as the best-selling boy bands in history with over 100 million records sold.<ref name=\"bsb\"/>\n\nIn the late 1990s in the UK, producer [[Simon Cowell]] (noted in the U.S. for the ''American Idol/X Factor'' franchise) is also known for having managed British boyband [[Five (band)|Five]] (formed in 1997) and Irish boyband [[Westlife]] (formed in 1998).

The key factor of a boy band is being trendy. This means that the band conforms to the most recent fashion and musical trends in the popular music scene. Typically, each member of the group will have some distinguishing feature and be portrayed as having a particular personality stereotype, such as \"the baby,\" \"the bad boy,\" or \"the shy one.\"  While managing the portrayal of popular musicians is as old as [[popular music]], the particular pigeonholing of band members is a defining characteristic of boy and girl bands.\n\nIn most cases, their music is written, arranged and produced by a producer who works with the band at all times and controls the group's sound \u2013 if necessary, to the point of hiring [[session singers]] to record guide vocals for each member of the group to sing individually if the members cannot harmonize well together. However, for clarity of each voice, recording each voice individually is most commonly the norm with most modern vocal groups.  In recent years [[auto-tune]] has become a popular tool for boy bands who are unable to sing to a high standard. Some boy bands have come under fire for this issue of using auto-tune. Some have also come under fire for [[lip syncing]] in their performances as well, for example [[New Kids on the Block]].<ref>{{cite news | title = New Kids' Performance Was Dubbed, Critic Says | url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-03-04/news/9203040523_1_mcpherson-new-kids-starr |newspaper = Orlando Sentinel | accessdate =August 15, 2012|date=March 4, 1992}}</ref>\n\nA typical boy band performance features elaborately choreographed dancing, with the members taking turns singing and/or rapping. Boy bands generally do not compose or produce their own material, unless the members lobby hard enough for creative control. However, some bands were created around the talent of a songwriter within the group like [[Gary Barlow]] of [[Take That]] or [[Tony Mortimer]] of [[East 17]]. It is not uncommon to find extra songs on an album written by one or more of the band members; however, their producers rarely use these as singles.\n\nSince the 21st century, however, boy bands have been expected to write or at least contribute in some part lyrically to songs. Apart from the groups mentioned above who all had at least one primary songwriter from their beginning, other groups soon caught up.  From the late nineties, members of [[Backstreet Boys]] who had previously used writers like [[Max Martin]] during their early albums began writing their own songs. Newer groups from late 2000s such as [[JLS]] have all made a point from early interviews that they write their own songs and hold their own image as this is an important part of marketing. Some bands like [[The Wanted]] have even spent time learning the craft of songwriting.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a329584/the-wanted-go-to-songwriting-camp-to-write-new-album.html |title=The Wanted go to songwriting camp to write new album |work=Digital Spy |date=July 13, 2011 | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIndividuals can also go on to achieve greater success as a solo artist coming out of a boy band having used the groups popularity to build on. Usually this signals the end of the group until potential future reunions. Examples of this include [[Michael Jackson]] from [[The Jackson 5]], [[Donny Osmond]] from [[The Osmonds]], [[Ricky Martin]] from [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], [[Justin Timberlake]] from *NSYNC, and [[Ronan Keating]] from [[Boyzone]]. Sometimes the most successful solo star from a band is not the most popular member such as [[Robbie Williams]] as opposed to lead singer [[Gary Barlow]] from [[Take That]]. Some boy band members have gone on to successful careers elsewhere in the media. [[Michael Dolenz]] of [[The Monkees]] went on to become a successful television producer, working for [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] franchises such as [[LWT]] and [[Television South]].\n\n==Music genres==\nAlthough most boy bands consist of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] or pop influences, other [[music genre]]s, most notably [[country music]] and [[folk music]], are also represented. [[South 65]] and [[Marshall Dyllon]], for example, were both country music boy bands. [[Il Divo]], created by [[Simon Cowell]] in 2004, are a vocal group that performs [[operatic pop]] in several (mainly Italian) languages. Since then operatic/classical boy bands have become quite popular and common, especially in the UK. Since 2001 there has been some crossover with [[power pop]] and [[pop punk]] from bands that play live instruments. Just recently some boy bands decided to go back to their original doo-wop roots, most notably, [[The Overtones]].\n\n==Controversy==\nSince the 2000s, groups such as [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[LFO (group)|LFO]] have disliked the term \"boy band\" and have preferred to be known as a \"male vocal group\".<ref>{{cite web| title = I would be the dessert because I\u2019m satisfying | url = http://www.popjustice.com/interviewsandfeatures/backstreet-boys-interview/49849/|publisher= Pop Justice | accessdate = August 16, 2012|date=October 24, 2007|quote=We were never a boyband.

The city sits at the confluence of the [[Weiser River]] with the great [[Snake River]], which marks the border with [[Oregon]].  The population was 5,507 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name=quickfacts>{{cite web | url = http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/16/1686140.html | title = Quickfacts: Weiser, Idaho| publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2011-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe city was named after the nearby [[Weiser River]], but exactly who that was named for is not precisely known. In one version it is for [[Peter M. Weiser]], a soldier and member of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] of 1804\u20131806.  Another has it for Jacob Weiser, a trapper-turned-miner who struck it rich in Baboon Gulch in the Florence Basin of Idaho in 1861. \n \nWilliam Logan and his wife Nancy were the first white settlers in the vicinity of Weiser in 1863 building a roadhouse in anticipation of the opening of Olds Ferry west of them on the [[Snake River]] across from [[Farewell Bend State Recreation Area|Farewell Bend]].  In 1863, Reuben Olds acquired a franchise from the Territorial Legislature and began operating [[Olds Ferry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patroloff.com/history.htm|title= Judge Frank Harris, THE HISTORY OF WASHINGTON COUNTY, Weiser Signal-American, Weiser, 194?. Chapter 11|author=|date=|website=patroloff.com|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>  Olds ferry business did well (as did Logan's) as it diverted much of the traffic from the old Snake River crossing point at  [[Fort Boise#Old Fort Boise .281834-54.29|Old Fort Boise]].  Increasing settlement on the Weiser River valley increased Weiser's population.  A post office was established in 1866 as Weiser Ranch. In 1871, it was renamed Weiser.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://washington.idgenweb.org/postoffices.htm|title=Washington County Post Offices|author=|date=|website=washington.idgenweb.org|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n \nWeiser reached its height of prosperity when a railroad way station was established and it became a transportation hub for travelers.  Its history is well represented by the great number of original buildings from the 1890s and early 1900s that are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nDuring the 1890s, the city had pretensions of becoming a major regional market and transportation center.  The Idaho Northern Railroad was built up the Weiser River with the intention of reaching Lewiston and river transportation to the ocean.  The dream ended among the lumber mills of central Idaho almost at the community of Meadows... not needing to actually go past the stock loading and lumber ponds outside the village, the terminus station was built there and a new city, New Meadows, came into being.  Likewise the Union Pacific, after taking over the Oregon Short Line chose not to locate its major section yards in the flats west of Weiser\u2014probably due to inflated prices asked by land speculators\u2014and built at [[Huntington, Oregon]] at the western edge of the [[Snake River]] valley.\n\n[[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Walter Johnson]] played semi-pro baseball for the Weiser Kids as a young man in 1906\u20131907.  After high school in [[Fullerton, California]], the \"Big Train\" was lured to Weiser to play baseball and work for the local telephone company.  While in Weiser, he once pitched 84 consecutive scoreless innings.  His skills drew the attention of the [[Washington Nationals (1905\u201356)|Washington Nationals]], who sent scout [[Cliff Blankenship]] to offer Johnson a contract, and in July 1907 he departed Idaho for the [[Major League Baseball|major leagues]] at age nineteen.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ca-EYo-gY0C&pg=PA1&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0 Walter Johnson: Baseball's Big Train], pages 17-32, by Henry W. Thomas, Published by U of Nebraska Press, 1998. On Google Books</ref>\n\n[[U.S. Route 95 in Idaho|U.S. Route 95]] runs through the city, connecting to [[Oregon]] and [[British Columbia]].\n\n==Culture==\nWeiser bills itself as the \"Fiddling Capital of the World\" and the [[National Oldtime Fiddlers' Contest]] has been held each year since 1953.  Fiddling contests have been held in Weiser since 1914, but the present festival was the idea of [[Blaine Stubblefield]], a fiddler and folk music collector, and the head of the city's [[chamber of commerce]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fiddlecontest.com/History.php | title = History of Fiddling, Fiddle Contests and the National Oldtime Fiddlers' Contest | publisher = National Oldtime Fiddlers' Contest & Festival, Weiser, Idaho | accessdate = 2010-05-18 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100806154829/http://www.fiddlecontest.com/History.php | archivedate = 2010-08-06 }}</ref>  The festival is held at the beginning of summer, during the third full week in June, the only exception occurring during leap years when it is held on the 4th week of the month.  It draws national media coverage and over 7,000 people to the Weiser area.\n\nThe city has been consistently served by the Weiser Signal-American, the local weekly newspaper.\n\nFor many years Weiser's location as the last city upriver from  [[Hells Canyon]] made it the jump-off point for wilderness tours by powered rubber raft down the gorge.  Enormous sturgeon and plentiful salmon were a draw for anglers.

The city sits at the confluence of the [[Weiser River]] with the great [[Snake River]], which marks the border with [[Oregon]].  The population was 5,507 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name=quickfacts>{{cite web | url = http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/16/1686140.html | title = Quickfacts: Weiser, Idaho| publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division | year = 2010 | accessdate = 2011-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe city was named after the nearby [[Weiser River]], but exactly who that was named for is not precisely known. In one version it is for [[Peter M. Weiser]], a soldier and member of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] of 1804\u20131806.  Another has it for Jacob Weiser, a trapper-turned-miner who struck it rich in Baboon Gulch in the Florence Basin of Idaho in 1861. \n \nWilliam Logan and his wife Nancy were the first white settlers in the vicinity of Weiser in 1863 building a roadhouse in anticipation of the opening of Olds Ferry west of them on the [[Snake River]] across from [[Farewell Bend State Recreation Area|Farewell Bend]].  In 1863, Reuben Olds acquired a franchise from the Territorial Legislature and began operating [[Olds Ferry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patroloff.com/history.htm|title= Judge Frank Harris, THE HISTORY OF WASHINGTON COUNTY, Weiser Signal-American, Weiser, 194?. Chapter 11|author=|date=|website=patroloff.com|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>  Olds ferry business did well (as did Logan's) as it diverted much of the traffic from the old Snake River crossing point at  [[Fort Boise#Old Fort Boise .281834-54.29|Old Fort Boise]].  Increasing settlement on the Weiser River valley increased Weiser's population.  A post office was established in 1866 as Weiser Ranch. In 1871, it was renamed Weiser.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://washington.idgenweb.org/postoffices.htm|title=Washington County Post Offices|author=|date=|website=washington.idgenweb.org|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n \nWeiser reached its height of prosperity when a railroad way station was established and it became a transportation hub for travelers.  Its history is well represented by the great number of original buildings from the 1890s and early 1900s that are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nDuring the 1890s, the city had pretensions of becoming a major regional market and transportation center.  The Idaho Northern Railroad was built up the Weiser River with the intention of reaching Lewiston and river transportation to the ocean.  The dream ended among the lumber mills of central Idaho almost at the community of Meadows... not needing to actually go past the stock loading and lumber ponds outside the village, the terminus station was built there and a new city, New Meadows, came into being.  Likewise the Union Pacific, after taking over the Oregon Short Line chose not to locate its major section yards in the flats west of Weiser\u2014probably due to inflated prices asked by land speculators\u2014and built at [[Huntington, Oregon]] at the western edge of the [[Snake River]] valley.\n\n[[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Walter Johnson]] played semi-pro baseball for the Weiser Kids as a young man in 1906\u20131907.  After high school in [[Fullerton, California]], the \"Big Train\" was lured to Weiser to play baseball and work for the local telephone company.  While in Weiser, he once pitched 84 consecutive scoreless innings.  His skills drew the attention of the [[Washington Nationals (1905\u201356)|Washington Nationals]], who sent scout [[Cliff Blankenship]] to offer Johnson a contract, and in July 1907 he departed Idaho for the [[Major League Baseball|major leagues]] at age nineteen.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ca-EYo-gY0C&pg=PA1&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0 Walter Johnson: Baseball's Big Train], pages 17-32, by Henry W. Thomas, Published by U of Nebraska Press, 1998. On Google Books</ref>\n\n[[U.S. Route 95 in Idaho|U.S. Route 95]] runs through the city, connecting to [[Oregon]] and [[British Columbia]].\n\n==Culture==\nWeiser bills itself as the \"Fiddling Capital of the World\" and the [[National Oldtime Fiddlers' Contest]] has been held each year since 1953.  Fiddling contests have been held in Weiser since 1914, but the present festival was the idea of [[Blaine Stubblefield]], a fiddler and folk music collector, and the head of the city's [[chamber of commerce]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fiddlecontest.com/History.php | title = History of Fiddling, Fiddle Contests and the National Oldtime Fiddlers' Contest | publisher = National Oldtime Fiddlers' Contest & Festival, Weiser, Idaho | accessdate = 2010-05-18 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100806154829/http://www.fiddlecontest.com/History.php | archivedate = 2010-08-06 }}</ref>  The festival is held at the beginning of summer, during the third full week in June, the only exception occurring during leap years when it is held on the 4th week of the month.

This 6 x 60\u2019 series will see daredevil Zef Eisenberg take on his toughest challenge yet - to break the British land speed record in a car he plans to engineer himself. With over 40 land speed records currently to his name, he's already done it on a bike at the iconic Pendine Sands in Wales. Now Zef wants to finish what Sir Malcolm Campbell started in 1927 and break the 200mph barrier in a car and, in doing so, become the only person to hold the British land speed records on both two and four wheels. In order to prepare for this dangerous feat, Zef is scouring the nation to meet fellow motoring mavericks and glean essential engineering know-how from their incredible \u201cfranken-machines\u201d.\u00a0 Whether they've fitted a 24,000cc W12 aero-engine into a car, or built from scratch a full Dakar off-road racer, Zef's going to get behind the wheel and under the bonnet of Britain's fastest cars, bikes and boats. Inspired by these extraordinary machines, Zef will challenge his own team of mechanics to take a different vehicle each week and make it as fast as humanly possible. The knowledge they gain will play a crucial part in helping this real-life Tony Stark and his team prepare Zef's crazy 1200hp specially built road-legal Porsche 911 Turbo S for the series finale - his death-defying record attempt at Pendine Sands. Speed Freaks has been commissioned for ITV4 by Paul Mortimer, Head of Digital Channels and Satmohan Panesar, Commissioning Editor, Factual Entertainment.  David Williams, Keshet Productions said, \u201cThis high-octane series features a feast of items and VTs geared up to indulge anyone with an interest in cars, motorsports and engineering.\u00a0 Zef\u2019s need for speed and desire to break that land-speed record is infectious and makes for compelling viewing.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/speed-freaks-itv4|title=ITV press release - Speed Freaks}}</ref> In May 2019, Eisenberg achieved his goal of achieving the fastest ever wheel driven vehicle bike and car at Pendine sands, with speeds in excess of 210mph. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petrolicious.com/articles/zef-eisenberg-smashes-outright-speed-and-flying-mile-records-at-pendine-sands-in-porsche-911-turbo|title=Eisenberg achieves outright speed records at Pendine|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''The Bike Show:'''\n\nZef has also appeared on several other TV shows, most notably The Bike Show with Henry Cole with Zef's famous MADMAX Turbine bike.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nZef Eisenberg, his famous MADMAX Turbine bike, and his infamous 230mph crash featured in Guy Martin's Channel 4, documentary about the world's fastest tractor with JCB.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motoringresearch.com/car-news/guy-martin-worlds-fastest-tractor/|title=Guy Martin - world's fastest tractor|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Ultra-speed motorbike and car racing ==\nEisenberg is an ultra-high-speed [[Motorcycle racing|motorbike racer]].

This 6 x 60\u2019 series will see daredevil Zef Eisenberg take on his toughest challenge yet - to break the British land speed record in a car he plans to engineer himself. With over 40 land speed records currently to his name, he's already done it on a bike at the iconic Pendine Sands in Wales. Now Zef wants to finish what Sir Malcolm Campbell started in 1927 and break the 200mph barrier in a car and, in doing so, become the only person to hold the British land speed records on both two and four wheels. In order to prepare for this dangerous feat, Zef is scouring the nation to meet fellow motoring mavericks and glean essential engineering know-how from their incredible \u201cfranken-machines\u201d.\u00a0 Whether they've fitted a 24,000cc W12 aero-engine into a car, or built from scratch a full Dakar off-road racer, Zef's going to get behind the wheel and under the bonnet of Britain's fastest cars, bikes and boats. Inspired by these extraordinary machines, Zef will challenge his own team of mechanics to take a different vehicle each week and make it as fast as humanly possible. The knowledge they gain will play a crucial part in helping this real-life Tony Stark and his team prepare Zef's crazy 1200hp specially built road-legal Porsche 911 Turbo S for the series finale - his death-defying record attempt at Pendine Sands. Speed Freaks has been commissioned for ITV4 by Paul Mortimer, Head of Digital Channels and Satmohan Panesar, Commissioning Editor, Factual Entertainment.

During the early period of Spanish rule, officials gave land to settlers as a check against the English.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nAs part of this program, in 1802, Gr\u00e9goire Sarpy was granted {{convert|6002|acre}} by [[Charles de Hault Delassus]], the [[List of commandants of the Illinois Country#Lieutenant Governors of Upper Louisiana|last Spanish lieutenant governor]] of the [[Illinois Country]]. The land grant covered the major area now known as Webster Groves.\n\nWebster Groves' location on the [[Pacific Railroad]] line led to its development as a suburb. In the late 19th century, overcrowding, congestion, and unhealthy conditions in St. Louis prompted urban residents to leave the city for quieter, safer surroundings.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}  In 1892 the developers of Webster Park, an early housing subdivision, promoted the new community as the \"Queen of the Suburbs\", offering residents superb housing options in a country-like atmosphere, as well as a swift commute to downtown St. Louis jobs.<ref name=\"Start 1975 1\">{{cite book | last = Start | first = Clarissa | title = Webster Groves | publisher = Council of the City of Webster Groves |year=1975 | location =Webster Groves, Missouri | page=1}}</ref> The first public school in the community was Douglass Elementary School, founded as a [[separate but equal]] school for African-American children in the post-Civil War black community in North Webster. In the 1920s, the school grew into [[Douglass High School (Webster Groves, Missouri)|Douglass High School]], the only high school in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] for black students. The school operated until 1956, when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] required desegregation.\n\nAs a suburban municipality, Webster Groves has its origins as five separate communities along adjacent railroad lines. Webster, Old Orchard, Webster Park, Tuxedo Park, and Selma merged in 1896 to implement public services and develop a unified city government.<ref name=\"Start 1975 1\" /> Since then, Webster Groves' tree-lined streets and abundance of single family homes have continued to attract people to the area as a \"great place to live, work and play\", not solely for the wealthy commuter suburb that early developers envisioned but for families that cut across all socioeconomic lines. The geographic and economic diversity of Webster Groves is evident in its variety of neighborhoods.\n\nIn the 1960s, Webster Groves was featured in ''[[16 In Webster Groves]]'', a televised documentary that writer [[Jonathan Franzen]], a native of Webster Groves, described in his memoir ''[[The Discomfort Zone]]'' as an \"early experiment in hour-long prime-time sociology\". According to Franzen, it depicted [[Webster Groves High School]], which he attended only a few years after the documentary's broadcast, as being \"ruled by a tiny elite of 'soshies' who made life gray and marginal for the great majority of students who weren\u2019t 'football captains,' 'cheerleaders' or 'dance queens'\"; the school was depicted as having a \"student body obsessed with grades, cars and money.\" Franzen thought \"the Webster Groves depicted in it bears minimal resemblance to the friendly, unpretentious town I knew when I was growing up.\"<ref>{{cite web| author= [[Sam Tanenhaus]] | title= Franzen in Webster Groves| url= http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/franzen-in-webster-groves/ | series=Paper Cuts (blog)| date= August 17, 2010| work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref>\n\nWebster Groves was the setting for the [[1974\u201375 United States network television schedule|1974-5]] [[NBC]] television series ''[[Lucas Tanner]]''.\n\nIn the wake of the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]], Webster Groves High School was again profiled, this time in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', which described Webster Groves as a \"pretty town of old elms and deep porches\" and a \"mix of $90,000 cottages and $750,000 homes, young marrieds and old-line families and transient middle managers assigned to a stint in the St. Louis office who are looking for a comfortable place to settle and keep their kids on the track toward prosperity.\"<ref>{{cite journal| author=Nancy Gibbs| title= A Week in the Life of a High School| journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=October 25, 1999| pages=67\u2013103| url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,992319,00.html| accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Webster Groves High School Statesmen maintain one of the oldest high school football rivalries west of the [[Mississippi River]] with the Pioneers of [[Kirkwood High School]].

During the early period of Spanish rule, officials gave land to settlers as a check against the English.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nAs part of this program, in 1802, Gr\u00e9goire Sarpy was granted {{convert|6002|acre}} by [[Charles de Hault Delassus]], the [[List of commandants of the Illinois Country#Lieutenant Governors of Upper Louisiana|last Spanish lieutenant governor]] of the [[Illinois Country]]. The land grant covered the major area now known as Webster Groves.\n\nWebster Groves' location on the [[Pacific Railroad]] line led to its development as a suburb. In the late 19th century, overcrowding, congestion, and unhealthy conditions in St. Louis prompted urban residents to leave the city for quieter, safer surroundings.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}  In 1892 the developers of Webster Park, an early housing subdivision, promoted the new community as the \"Queen of the Suburbs\", offering residents superb housing options in a country-like atmosphere, as well as a swift commute to downtown St. Louis jobs.<ref name=\"Start 1975 1\">{{cite book | last = Start | first = Clarissa | title = Webster Groves | publisher = Council of the City of Webster Groves |year=1975 | location =Webster Groves, Missouri | page=1}}</ref> The first public school in the community was Douglass Elementary School, founded as a [[separate but equal]] school for African-American children in the post-Civil War black community in North Webster. In the 1920s, the school grew into [[Douglass High School (Webster Groves, Missouri)|Douglass High School]], the only high school in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] for black students. The school operated until 1956, when the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] required desegregation.\n\nAs a suburban municipality, Webster Groves has its origins as five separate communities along adjacent railroad lines. Webster, Old Orchard, Webster Park, Tuxedo Park, and Selma merged in 1896 to implement public services and develop a unified city government.<ref name=\"Start 1975 1\" /> Since then, Webster Groves' tree-lined streets and abundance of single family homes have continued to attract people to the area as a \"great place to live, work and play\", not solely for the wealthy commuter suburb that early developers envisioned but for families that cut across all socioeconomic lines. The geographic and economic diversity of Webster Groves is evident in its variety of neighborhoods.\n\nIn the 1960s, Webster Groves was featured in ''[[16 In Webster Groves]]'', a televised documentary that writer [[Jonathan Franzen]], a native of Webster Groves, described in his memoir ''[[The Discomfort Zone]]'' as an \"early experiment in hour-long prime-time sociology\". According to Franzen, it depicted [[Webster Groves High School]], which he attended only a few years after the documentary's broadcast, as being \"ruled by a tiny elite of 'soshies' who made life gray and marginal for the great majority of students who weren\u2019t 'football captains,' 'cheerleaders' or 'dance queens'\"; the school was depicted as having a \"student body obsessed with grades, cars and money.\" Franzen thought \"the Webster Groves depicted in it bears minimal resemblance to the friendly, unpretentious town I knew when I was growing up.\"<ref>{{cite web| author= [[Sam Tanenhaus]] | title= Franzen in Webster Groves| url= http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/franzen-in-webster-groves/ | series=Paper Cuts (blog)| date= August 17, 2010| work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref>\n\nWebster Groves was the setting for the [[1974\u201375 United States network television schedule|1974-5]] [[NBC]] television series ''[[Lucas Tanner]]''.\n\nIn the wake of the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]], Webster Groves High School was again profiled, this time in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', which described Webster Groves as a \"pretty town of old elms and deep porches\" and a \"mix of $90,000 cottages and $750,000 homes, young marrieds and old-line families and transient middle managers assigned to a stint in the St. Louis office who are looking for a comfortable place to settle and keep their kids on the track toward prosperity.\"<ref>{{cite journal| author=Nancy Gibbs| title= A Week in the Life of a High School| journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=October 25, 1999| pages=67\u2013103| url= http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,992319,00.html| accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Webster Groves High School Statesmen maintain one of the oldest high school football rivalries west of the [[Mississippi River]] with the Pioneers of [[Kirkwood High School]].
