These indigenous claims were quickly reduced and removed by various treaties. The [[Treaty of St. Mary's (1818)#New Purchase Tract|1818 Treaty with the Delaware Indians]] brought most of central Indiana into state control, and [[Madison County, Indiana|Madison County]] was organized on a portion of that area. The lower portion of Madison County was quickly settled, and by the late 1820s the inhabitants were petitioning for a separate county government. Accordingly, a portion of the county was partitioned on 1 March 1828, to form Hancock County. Greenfield was named as the county seat on 11 April. The county name recognized [[John Hancock]], president of the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]], who had signed his name prominently to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776.<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

In fact, Eaton created a one-page Hancock County Overdose Report form for officers to fill out when they turn in an affidavit for a search warrant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://filtermag.org/overdose-prosecution-indiana-naloxone-hancock/|title=Naloxone Now Used as Evidence to Prosecute Indiana OD Victims|date=2020-02-19|website=Filter|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref>\n\n{{Hidden begin|titlestyle=background:#ccccff|title=Presidential election results}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Atlas of US Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=17 May 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

These indigenous claims were quickly reduced and removed by various treaties. The [[Treaty of St. Mary's (1818)#New Purchase Tract|1818 Treaty with the Delaware Indians]] brought most of central Indiana into state control, and [[Madison County, Indiana|Madison County]] was organized on a portion of that area. The lower portion of Madison County was quickly settled, and by the late 1820s the inhabitants were petitioning for a separate county government. Accordingly, a portion of the county was partitioned on 1 March 1828, to form Hancock County. Greenfield was named as the county seat on 11 April. The county name recognized [[John Hancock]], president of the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]], who had signed his name prominently to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776.<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R.

The second stage was construction of the Pier Hotel. Agreements changed before Stage 2 began. The state government withdrew from the now-considered risky hotel development and sold the land to the consortium. The plan also changed, with the separation of the hotel from the Platinum Apartments \u2013 the new plan became known as Stage 2B.\n\nMeanwhile, a public-opinion survey in the lead-up to the May 2003 local government elections caused the council to rethink its support of the new plan.

The other side either had a sponsor's logo (e.g.: [[Coca-Cola]]) or ''\"NO CASH VALUE\"'' in big font around a logo shaped like [[South Australia]] labelled ''\"SA\"''.\n\n[[File:Magic_Mountain_2002_tokens.jpg|thumb|left|Two Magic Mountain tokens from 2002, this one with advertising on one side.]] [[File:Magic_Mountain_2002_tokens_(2).jpg|thumb|left|Two other Magic Mountain tokens showing the design when advertisers don't pay to be seen.]]<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\n\n==Attractions==\n\n<b>GROUND FLOOR:</b>\n\n* [[Pinball machines]] (20+/- approx.)\n''Titles included:''<br>\n- [[Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation_(pinball)|Star Trek: The Next Generation]]<br>\n* [[arcade game|Arcade Machines]] (35+/- approx.)\n''Titles included:''<br>\n- [[Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(arcade_game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]<br>\n- [[The_Simpsons_(video_game)|The Simpsons]]<br>\n* [[Air Hockey]] (3+/- approx.)\n* A [[Carousel]] (1 - which has now been preserved)\n* [[Miniature golf|Mini-Golf Course]] (1)<br><br>\n\n<b>LEVEL 1:</b>\n\n* A [[light gun|Light-Rifle]] [[Wild West]] themed [[shooting range|Shooting Gallery]] (1):\n\nA red sanded Old West desert plain area, red and white bullseye targets everywhere, one for each interactive target, doing comical actions when shot.\nFor example, The Piano Player would jerk around then play a short tune on his piano.

The plan, signed in 1997, included a profit-sharing agreement between the [[Government of South Australia|state government]] and the Holdfast Shores consortium, and a separate agreement concerning public infrastructure with the local government (the [[City of Holdfast Bay]]).\n\nStage 1 saw the construction of the marina, the Marina Pier and two apartment blocks. The second stage was construction of the Pier Hotel. Agreements changed before Stage 2 began. The state government withdrew from the now-considered risky hotel development and sold the land to the consortium. The plan also changed, with the separation of the hotel from the Platinum Apartments \u2013 the new plan became known as Stage 2B.\n\nMeanwhile, a public-opinion survey in the lead-up to the May 2003 local government elections caused the council to rethink its support of the new plan. Their new-found opposition to the proposed beachfront high-rise apartments focused on Magic Mountain as the one parcel of land within the project that was under their control.<ref name=\"cracks\">[http://www.adelaidereview.com.au/archives/2004_02/issuesandopinion_story1.shtml Cracks in the plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823010151/http://www.adelaidereview.com.au/archives/2004_02/issuesandopinion_story1.shtml |date=23 August 2006 }}, ''The Adelaide Review'', February 2004</ref>\n\nThe council's campaign was ultimately unsuccessful and the development received Government approval in early 2004.<ref name=\"holdfastshores\">[http://www.holdfast.sa.gov.au/db/whats_new/story.php?primKeyPost=126 Glenelg\u2019s Holdfast Shores Project near Completion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917193758/http://www.holdfast.sa.gov.au/db/whats_new/story.php?primKeyPost=126 |date=17 September 2006 }}, [[City of Holdfast Bay]], 24 August 2006</ref> Magic Mountain closed for the last time on 18 July 2004 and was demolished soon after.

{"title_page": "Ball mill", "text_new": "{{for|the type of end mill|Milling cutter#Ball nose cutter}}\n\n[[Image:Ball mill.gif|thumb|Ball mill]]\nA '''ball mill''' is a type of [[grinder (milling)|grinder]] used to grind, blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics and [[selective laser sintering]].  It works on the principle of  impact and  attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.\n\nA ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis.  The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal.  It is partially filled with balls.  The grinding media are the balls, which may be made of steel ([[chrome steel]]), stainless steel, ceramic or rubber.  The inner surface of the cylindrical shell is usually lined with an abrasion-resistant material such as [[Mangalloy|manganese steel]] or [http://sakarrubtech.com/mill-lining.php rubber lining].  Less wear takes place in rubber lined mills.  The length of the mill is approximately equal to its diameter.\n\nThe general idea behind the ball mill is an ancient one, but it was not until the [[industrial revolution]] and the invention of [[steam power]] that an effective ball milling machine could be built.  It is reported to have been used for grinding flint for pottery in 1870.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kj7PSOqTZ3IC&printsec=frontcover|title=The history of grinding|publisher=SME|year=2005|isbn=0-87335-238-6|author=Lynch, A.|author2=Rowland C}}</ref>\n\n==Working==\nIn case of continuously operated ball mill, the material to be ground is fed from the left through a 60\u00b0 cone and the product is discharged through a 30\u00b0 cone to the right. As the shell rotates, the balls are lifted up on the rising side of the shell and then they cascade down (or drop down on to the feed), from near the top of the shell.

The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wet or dry. There are two kinds of ball mill, grate type and overfall type due to different ways of discharging material.  Many types of grinding media are suitable for use in a ball mill, each material having its own specific properties and advantages.  Key properties of grinding media are size, density, hardness, and composition.\n* Size: The smaller the media particles, the smaller the particle size of the final product.  At the same time, the grinding media particles should be substantially larger than the largest pieces of material to be ground.\n* Density: The media should be denser than the material being ground.  It becomes a problem if the grinding media floats on top of the material to be ground.\n* Hardness: The grinding media needs to be durable enough to grind the material, but where possible should not be so tough that it also wears down the tumbler at a fast pace.\n* Composition: Various grinding applications have special requirements.  Some of these requirements are based on the fact that some of the grinding media will be in the finished product.  Others are based in how the media will react with the material being ground.\n* Where the color of the finished product is important, the color and material of the grinding media must be considered.\n* Where low contamination is important, the grinding media may be selected for ease of separation from the finished product (i.e.: steel dust produced from stainless steel media can be magnetically separated from non-ferrous products).  An alternative to separation is to use media of the same material as the product being ground.\n* Flammable products have a tendency to become [[dust explosion|explosive in powder form]].  Steel media may spark, becoming an ignition source for these products.  Either wet-grinding, or non-sparking media such as [[ceramic]] or [[lead]] must be selected.\n* Some media, such as iron, may react with corrosive materials.  For this reason, [[stainless steel]], ceramic, and [[flint]] grinding media may each be used when corrosive substances are present during grinding.\n\nThe grinding chamber can also be filled with an inert [[shield gas]] that does not react with the material being ground, to prevent oxidation or explosive reactions that could occur with ambient air inside the mill.\n\n==Advantages of the ball mill==\n[[File:Ceramic ball mill before 1945 Thiem and Towe Halle.jpg|thumb|Ceramic ball mill before 1945 [[Thiem&Towe]] [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].

Planetary ball mills are smaller than common ball mills and mainly used in laboratories for grinding sample material down to very small sizes. A planetary ball mill consists of at least one grinding jar which is arranged eccentrically on a so-called sun wheel. The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars (ratio: 1:-2 or 1:-1).\nThe grinding balls in the grinding jars are subjected to superimposed rotational movements, the so-called Coriolis forces. The difference in speeds between the balls and grinding jars produces an interaction between frictional and impact forces, which releases high dynamic energies. The interplay between these forces produces the high and very effective degree of size reduction of the planetary ball mill.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cement mill]]\n*[[Vertical roller mill]]\n*[[Tumble finishing]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n{{commons category|Ball mills}}\n\n{{Extractive metallurgy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ball Mill}}\n[[Category:Grinding mills]]\n[[Category:Mining equipment]]\n", "text_old": "{{For2|the type of end mill|[[Milling cutter#Ball nose cutter|Ball nose cutter]]}}\n\n[[Image:Ball mill.gif|thumb|Ball mill]]\nA '''ball mill''' is a type of [[grinder (milling)|grinder]] used to grind, blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics and [[selective laser sintering]].  It works on the principle of  impact and  attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.\n\nA ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotating about its axis.  The axis of the shell may be either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal.  It is partially filled with balls.  The grinding media are the balls, which may be made of steel ([[chrome steel]]), stainless steel, ceramic or rubber.  The inner surface of the cylindrical shell is usually lined with an abrasion-resistant material such as [[Mangalloy|manganese steel]] or [http://sakarrubtech.com/mill-lining.php rubber lining].  Less wear takes place in rubber lined mills.  The length of the mill is approximately equal to its diameter.\n\nThe general idea behind the ball mill is an ancient one, but it was not until the [[industrial revolution]] and the invention of [[steam power]] that an effective ball milling machine could be built.  It is reported to have been used for grinding flint for pottery in 1870.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kj7PSOqTZ3IC&printsec=frontcover|title=The history of grinding|publisher=SME|year=2005|isbn=0-87335-238-6|author=Lynch, A.|author2=Rowland C}}</ref>\n\n==Working==\nIn case of continuously operated ball mill, the material to be ground is fed from the left through a 60\u00b0 cone and the product is discharged through a 30\u00b0 cone to the right.

The first stage of a new colony is known as the pre-emergence state, in which workers have not been produced. No adult offspring are present and the larvae are still very young. A pre-emergent colony can have one or more queens.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>\n\nFollowing the pre-emergent state, the colony grows to the emergent stage. Workers are present along with larvae of different ages and multiple adult generations. In nests with fewer queens, intermediate females can be found.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>\n\n''S. cyanea'' males are present in the colony during the male-producing stage.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>\n\nUpon nest abandonment during the late summer, the colony shifts to the quiescent stage, i.e. the nest site no longer houses wasps.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\" />\n\n==Behavior==\n\n===Dominance hierarchy===\n\nThe hierarchy of ''S. cyanea'' is based on physiology, specifically ovarian development. Wasps containing undeveloped filamentous [[ovariole]]s, slightly developed oocytes, or some mature oocytes are considered workers and intermediates. Wasps with well-developed and longer ovarioles with mature oocytes become queens. The number of queens in the colony determines the development of a queen\u2019s ovaries. If there are more queens present, the ovaries are at a lower degree of development. One benefit to this is that as a swarming insect, queens with smaller abdomens are able to fly more easily  than queens with larger abdomens. This makes the queen less susceptible to predators.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>\n\n===Foraging===\n\nForaging activity for the swarm-founding wasp ''S. cyanea'' begins early in the morning and stops in the evening. During the hottest hours of the day, activity of the wasps is highest. In addition to temperature, ''S. cyanea'' increase their activity with decreased levels of humidity and heightened intensities of light. While foraging, the wasps collect water for temperature control, wood pulp for building and repairing the nest, sugary substances for both the larvae and adults and finally animal protein for larvae.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/>\n\n===Nest repair===\n\nFollowing damage by rain to the nest, ''S. cyanea'' will seal a leak of water with their mouth-pieces. Individuals begin by suctioning the water from the wall of the nest and then finish by expelling the water to the exterior of the colony. The hole is then repaired using wood pulp.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/>\n\n==Kin selection==\n\n===Worker-queen conflict===\n\nIn ''S. cyanea'', discrimination between the queen and workers is often not determined by morphology, but by physiology.

The first stage of a new colony is known as the pre-emergence state, in which workers have not been produced. No adult offspring are present and the larvae are still very young. A pre-emergent colony can have one or more queens.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>\n\nFollowing the pre-emergent state, the colony grows to the emergent stage. Workers are present along with larvae of different ages and multiple adult generations. In nests with fewer queens, intermediate females can be found.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>\n\n''S. cyanea'' males are present in the colony during the male-producing stage.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>\n\nUpon nest abandonment during the late summer, the colony shifts to the quiescent stage, i.e. the nest site no longer houses wasps.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\" />\n\n==Behavior==\n\n===Dominance hierarchy===\n\nThe hierarchy of ''S. cyanea'' is based on physiology, specifically ovarian development. Wasps containing undeveloped filamentous [[ovariole]]s, slightly developed oocytes, or some mature oocytes are considered workers and intermediates. Wasps with well-developed and longer ovarioles with mature oocytes become queens. The number of queens in the colony determines the development of a queen\u2019s ovaries. If there are more queens present, the ovaries are at a lower degree of development. One benefit to this is that as a swarming insect, queens with smaller abdomens are able to fly more easily  than queens with larger abdomens. This makes the queen less susceptible to predators.<ref name=\"Noda 2003\"/>\n\n===Foraging===\n\nForaging activity for the swarm-founding wasp ''S. cyanea'' begins early in the morning and stops in the evening. During the hottest hours of the day, activity of the wasps is highest. In addition to temperature, ''S. cyanea'' increase their activity with decreased levels of humidity and heightened intensities of light. While foraging, the wasps collect water for temperature control, wood pulp for building and repairing the nest, sugary substances for both the larvae and adults and finally animal protein for larvae.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/>\n\n===Nest repair===\n\nFollowing damage by rain to the nest, ''S. cyanea'' will seal a leak of water with their mouth-pieces. Individuals begin by suctioning the water from the wall of the nest and then finish by expelling the water to the exterior of the colony. The hole is then repaired using wood pulp.<ref name=\"Elisei 2005\"/>\n\n==Kin selection==\n\n===Worker-queen conflict===\n\nIn ''S. cyanea'', discrimination between the queen and workers is often not determined by morphology, but by physiology. Young females in the colony can develop ovaries at different points in the cycle, so castes must be determined by the adult wasps rather than at the larval stage. Often, adult wasps will manipulate young females and suppress their ovaries because a wasp becomes a queen once she has mated. The number of queens allowed in a nest often fluctuates.

In the early 1980s, she advanced the ideas and strategies proposed by the Pictures Generation Movement and began working with found images, re-photography, appropriation, film and installation, taking her place among those artists who have helped to redefine photography. She takes an intuitive approach to creating conceptual works in the construction of a coherent visual language.\u00a0 A retrospective exhibition of her work was organized in 2010 by the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and traveled to the ICA in Philadelphia<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/94790029.html|title=A Conversation: Jennifer Bolande and David Robbins|website=archive.jsonline.com|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>, and the Luckman Gallery at California State University in Los Angeles.

In the early 1980s, she advanced the ideas and strategies proposed by the Pictures Generation Movement and began working with found images, re-photography, appropriation, film and installation, taking her place among those artists who have helped to redefine photography. She takes an intuitive approach to creating conceptual works in the construction of a coherent visual language.\u00a0 A retrospective exhibition of her work was organized in 2010 by the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and traveled to the ICA in Philadelphia<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/94790029.html|title=A Conversation: Jennifer Bolande and David Robbins|website=archive.jsonline.com|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>, and the Luckman Gallery at California State University in Los Angeles.
