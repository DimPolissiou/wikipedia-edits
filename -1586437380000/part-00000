Nearly all of Thai production is consumed locally. Almost 85% of palm plantations and extraction mills are in south Thailand. At year-end 2016, 4.7 to 5.8 million [[Rai (unit)|rai]] were planted in oil palms, employing 300,000 farmers, mostly on small landholdings of 20 rai. [[ASEAN]] as a region accounts for 52.5 million tonnes of palm oil production, about 85% of the world total and more than 90% of global exports. Indonesia accounts for 52% of world exports. Malaysian exports total 38%. The biggest consumers of palm oil are India, the European Union, and China, with the three consuming nearly 50% of world exports. Thailand's Department of Internal Trade (DIT) usually sets the price of crude palm oil and refined palm oil. Thai farmers have a relatively low yield compared to those in Malaysia and Indonesia. Thai palm oil crops yield 4\u201317% oil compared to around 20% in competing countries. In addition, Indonesian and Malaysian oil palm plantations are 10 times the size of Thai plantations.<ref name=\"BP-20180128\">{{cite news|last1=Arunmas|first1=Phusadee|last2=Wipatayotin|first2=Apinya|title=EU move fuelling unease among palm oil producers|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/1403374/eu-move-fuelling-unease-among-palm-oil-producers|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=28 January 2018|format=Spectrum}}</ref>\n\n===Colombia===\nIn the 1960s, about {{convert|18,000|ha|sqmi}} were planted with palm.

When Michaela's partner is unavailable due to a \"busted pipe,\" Jared reluctantly follows Michaela's instincts and they interrupt the [[BATF|ATF]]'s undercover operation. Jared takes responsibility for his decision and is suspended. Grace learns the life insurance company intends to recollect the $500K which they paid her after Ben's disappearance and presumed death. Ben meets Grace's ex-boyfriend Danny after Olive was detained for attempting to shoplift a lipstick from a cosmetic store. Thomas escaped from the institution and the NSA is searching for him. With help from Michaela and Saanvi, Bethany correctly interprets the clues from Michaela's vision and they find Thomas. Bethany explains that Leo went missing two years after their flight disappeared, leaving no one to meet Thomas.

The fifth bus contained eleven passengers who were foreign nationals, had no next of kin, or were otherwise individuals no one would report as missing.

The fifth bus contained eleven passengers who were foreign nationals, had no next of kin, or were otherwise individuals no one would report as missing. The buses were contracted by Unified Dynamic Systems (UDS), a large corporation involved in many industries. After getting some information from a translator, Michaela locates a farm where UDS is experimenting on the eleven passengers, but she and Jared are chased away by armed men. Ben confronts Vance about the missing passengers, believing the NSA is behind their disappearance and threatens to tell the press. Although Vance has dossiers on the eleven passengers showing they are accounted for, he leads a team to investigate the farm location. UDS has moved locations, but Vance finds a bloody bandage that was left behind by accident.

At the same time, Ben and TJ work through a separate calling that leads them to Logan's brother Frank. Frank has the key to the safety deposit box and Ben takes him to the bank. Inside the box is a compass with a bullet in it that saved Logan and Frank's grandfather during World War II. Logan believes it will save his life too, and he gives it to Michaela for safekeeping while he is incarcerated. Having learned about the death date, TJ is upset and Olive takes him to the Church of the Returned for hope. Following the incident at the bank, Jared meets Tamara for a date. Meanwhile, the Major realizes she's been exposed and has Saanvi's research stolen from her lab and home. Saanvi tells Vance she had isolated the trait and was working on ways to both grant it to others and remove it from those who have it.\n| LineColor       = 3F4469\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 21\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = Coordinated Flight\n| DirectedBy      = Marisol Adler\n| WrittenBy       = Matthew Lau & Marta Gen\u00e9 Camps\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|3}}\n| ProdCode        = T30.10205\n| Viewers         = 3.55<ref name=\"2.05\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-3-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.3.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=February 4, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate= February 4, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary = Olive is the only witness when Xers vandalize the Church of the Returned and attack a member, and Ben receives a calling to \"save her\". Meanwhile, Grace's car is forced off the road by other Xers. In both instances, police dismiss the seriousness of the events because the victims are passengers and the attacks appear random. While being treated at the hospital, Ben and Grace learn their baby is a girl and assume the calling was about her. Ben and TJ review events and realize the Xer attacks have been carefully planned to divert police manpower. Olive tells Michaela what she saw and identifies a suspect, who directs the police to a meeting place for Xers. Jared knows Tamara's brother Billy was involved, so he leaks news of the coming raid to them and Michaela's strike team finds nothing. In return, Jared is introduced to Simon White, the organizer of the Xers. Meanwhile, Zeke tries to [[Twelve-step program|make amends]] with Courtney, a woman he wronged as an addict.
