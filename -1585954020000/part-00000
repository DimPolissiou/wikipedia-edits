Common functions of [[patient safety]] organizations are data collection and analysis, reporting, education, funding, and advocacy.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Patient safety#Prevalence of adverse events|reports]] in several countries revealed a staggering number of patient injuries and deaths each year due to avoidable errors and deficiencies in health care, among them [[adverse events]] and [[complication (medicine)|complications]] arising from poor infection control. In the United States, a 1999 report from the [[Institute of Medicine]] called for a broad national effort to prevent these events, including the establishment of patient safety centers, expanded reporting of adverse events, and development of safety programs in health care organizations.<ref name=IOM>{{cite web | last=Institute of Medicine | year=1999 | url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9728&page=R19| title=To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System (1999) | publisher=The National Academies Press | accessdate=2006-06-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826010429/http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=9728&page=R19|archivedate=26 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Although many PSOs are funded and run by governments, others have sprung from private entities such as industry, professional, and consumer groups.\n\n==Functions==\nTo achieve their goals, PSOs may\n# Collect data on the prevalence and individual details of errors.\n# Analyze sources of error by [[root cause analysis]].\n# Propose and disseminate methods for error prevention.\n# Design and conduct pilot projects to study safety initiatives, including monitoring of results.\n# Raise awareness and inform the public, health professionals, providers, purchasers, and employers.\n# Conduct fundraising and provide funding for research and safety projects.\n# Advocate for regulatory and legislative changes.\n\n==Governmental organizations==\n\n===World Health Organization===\n\n====World Alliance for Patient Safety====\n\nIn response to a 2002 World Health Assembly Resolution, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) launched the World Alliance for Patient Safety in October 2004.

Since 2005, the NPSA has also been responsible for: safety aspects of hospital design, cleanliness and food; safe research practices through the National Research Ethics Service (NRES); and performance of individual doctors and dentists, through the National Clinical Assessment Service (NCAS).<ref>National Health Service: [http://www.npsa.nhs.uk National Patient Safety Agency]</ref> The NPSA identifies patient safety deficiencies with the input of clinical experts and patients, develops solutions and monitors results of corrections within the NHS. Initiatives and alerts include hand hygiene, information for doctors and patients on steps to reduce risk of error, vaccine safety and disclosure of error to injured patients. In addition, the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) allows NHS employees to provide the NPSA with reports anonymously.\n\n====National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence====\nThe [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] is an independent organisation that produces guidance on public health, health technologies and clinical practice in England and Wales. NICE has three centres of excellence. The Centre for Public Health Excellence develops public health guidance, with information for patients on diagnosis and treatment of specific illnesses and conditions. The Centre for Health Technology Evaluation recommends medicines and evaluates the safety and efficacy of procedures within the [[National Health Service]]. The Centre for Clinical Practice develops evidence-based [[Guideline (medical)|clinical guidelines]] for clinicians on the appropriate treatment of people with specific diseases.<ref>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) [http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=home Providing national guidance on promoting good health]</ref> NICE and the [[#National Patient Safety Agency .28NPSA.29|National Patient Safety Agency]] (NPSA) cooperate in risk assessment of new technology, monitoring safety incidents associated with procedures, and providing solutions if adverse outcomes are reported.

An organization must undergo an on-site survey by a Joint Commission survey team at least every three years. The scope of reviews by JCAHO is broad, including hospitals, home care agencies, medical equipment providers, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, surgical centers and medical laboratories. Passing a survey is crucial for most organizations, since accreditation by JCAHO is required for participation in [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and some state and private health care programs. Since the accreditation rate is over 90%, there have been questions raised regarding the effectiveness of these surveys.<ref>{{cite news | last = Gaul | first = Gilbert M. | title = Accreditors Blamed for Overlooking Problems | publisher = The Washington Post | date = 2005-07-25 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/24/AR2005072401023.html | accessdate = 2006-07-08 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, JCAHO began including outcomes and other performance data into the accreditation process (the \"ORYX initiative\"). Information gained allowed the Joint Commission to develop National Patient Safety Goals to promote specific improvements in patient safety.<ref>JCAHO [http://www.jointcommission.org/PatientSafety/NationalPatientSafetyGoals National Patient Safety Goals]</ref> The Goals highlight problem areas in health care and describe evidence-based solutions. Examples include prevention of falls, patient identification, reducing [[hospital infections]] and [[pressure ulcers]], and improving hospital staff communication. In addition, the Joint Commission created a \"do not use\" list of abbreviations<ref>JCAHO  [http://www.jointcommission.org/PatientSafety/DoNotUseList \"do not use\" list] of abbreviations</ref> in 2004 to avoid acronyms and symbols that lead to misinterpretation.\n\nIdentifying [[sentinel event]]s and analyzing the root causes has been a focus of JCAHO since 1996; the first eight alerts were published in 1998. The Commission defines a sentinel event as \"any unexpected occurrence involving death or serious physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof.\"<ref>JCAHO: {http://www.jcipatientsafety.org/show.asp?durki=9751&site=165&return=9368 Sentinel Events}</ref> The health care facility experiencing the sentinel event is expected to complete a thorough [[root cause analysis]], make improvements to the underlying processes, and monitor the effectiveness of the changes.  Although the cause of most sentinel events is human error, changes in organizational systems will reduce the likelihood of human error in the future and protect patients from harm when human error does occur. Specific causes of sentinel events and the solutions that hospitals then used successfully to reduce risks are publicized by JCAHO annually. Alerts have included issues as varied as wrong site surgery, restraint deaths, [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] and [[medication errors]] and patient abductions.\n\nIn 2005, JCAHO established an International Center for Patient Safety to collaborate with international patient safety organizations to identify, develop and share safety solutions, conduct joint research, and advocate public policy changes.

PSMF also encourages healthcare technology companies to sign their Open Data Pledge, which 90 companies have signed to date. The Open Data Pledge asks any healthcare technology company to share the data their devices and systems generate without knowingly interfering, blocking or charging for that data. This data is critical to the industry's ability to develop accurate algorithms and processes to keep patients from harm. PSMF also has more than 60 partnerships with professional societies, associations, other global non-profits and advocacy groups to help get to zero deaths more quickly. PSMF also works closely with patients and their families. They're well known for producing short \"patient story\" videos that use patient voices to tell stories about preventable deaths and harm - all which are disseminated freely online for anyone to use.

Although the cause of most sentinel events is human error, changes in organizational systems will reduce the likelihood of human error in the future and protect patients from harm when human error does occur. Specific causes of sentinel events and the solutions that hospitals then used successfully to reduce risks are publicized by JCAHO annually. Alerts have included issues as varied as wrong site surgery, restraint deaths, [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]] and [[medication errors]] and patient abductions.\n\nIn 2005, JCAHO established an International Center for Patient Safety to collaborate with international patient safety organizations to identify, develop and share safety solutions, conduct joint research, and advocate public policy changes.

ASMSO was acquired by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) in 2013 and renamed the Medication Safety Officers Society (MSOS). Membership in MSOS is currently free to all interested parties who register.\n\n====Missouri Center for Patient Safety====\nThe [[Missouri Center for Patient Safety]] (MOCPS)<ref>[http://www.mocps.org The Missouri Center for Patient Safety]</ref> is a private, not-for-profit corporation fostering change throughout Missouri's health care delivery systems and across the continuum of care. It was established by the [[Missouri Hospital Association]] (MHA),<ref>[http://web.mhanet.com Missouri Hospital Association]</ref> the [[Missouri State Medical Association]] (MSMA)<ref>[http://www.msma.org Missouri State Medical Association]</ref> and [[Primaris]]<ref>[http://www.primaris.org Primaris]</ref> in response to recommendations from the Governor's Commission for Patient Safety.\n\nInitiatives that are currently the focus of MOCPS include the People, Priorities and Learning Together (PPLT) initiative, which brings together evidence-based practices that have been part of the work of the MOCPS and Missouri Hospital Association. This approach offers options for hospitals to select components of the initiative to fit their own unique needs for quality and safety efforts, providing options to select components of most value to the individual hospital.{{cn|date=September 2018}} In addition to opportunities to learn the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP), TeamSTEPPS\u2122, [[Just_Culture | just culture]], and other processes to improve teamwork and communication, participants may join clinical collaboratives, including the national CUSP/Stop BSI and CUSP/CAUTI projects focused on prevention of blood stream infections and catheter-associated blood stream infections. Additional initiatives include the Hand Hygiene Project, Prevention of Injury from Falls, and Hospital and Medical Offices Surveys on Patient Safety.\n\n====National Patient Safety Foundation====\nIn May 2017 the [[National Patient Safety Foundation]] and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) began working together as one organization. The merged entity is committed to using its combined knowledge and resources to focus and energize the patient safety agenda in order to build systems of safety across the continuum of care.\n\n====Patient Safety Movement Foundation====\nThe [http://www.patientsafetymovement.org Patient Safety Movement Foundation] (PSMF) is a commitments-based global non-profit that has a bold goal to achieve ZERO preventable deaths in hospitals. PSMF works with partners in more than 50 countries worldwide. The organization was founded in 2012 by [[Joe Kiani]] and is based in Irvine, California. Over the last 7 years, PSMF has gathered 4,710 hospitals over 46 countries. These hospitals have reported to save more than 90,146 lives through their commitments. Most of these commitments align with the PSMF's [http://www.patientsafetymovement.org/apss Actionable Patient Safety Solutions] (APSS), a collection of 34 evidence-based best practice documents which can help hospitals get closer to zero preventable in-hospital deaths when implemented in their facilities. PSMF also encourages healthcare technology companies to sign their Open Data Pledge, which 90 companies have signed to date. The Open Data Pledge asks any healthcare technology company to share the data their devices and systems generate without knowingly interfering, blocking or charging for that data. This data is critical to the industry's ability to develop accurate algorithms and processes to keep patients from harm. PSMF also has more than 60 partnerships with professional societies, associations, other global non-profits and advocacy groups to help get to zero deaths more quickly. PSMF also works closely with patients and their families. They're well known for producing short \"patient story\" videos that use patient voices to tell stories about preventable deaths and harm - all which are disseminated freely online for anyone to use. PSMF annually hosts its World Safety, Science & Technology Summit, which brings together all stakeholder groups to discuss solutions to the leading challenges hospitals face. At the Summit each year, PSMF recognizes influential patient safety advocates with its Humanitarian Awards, given in memory of Beau Biden and Steven Moreau.\n\n====Safe Care Campaign====\nThe [[Safe Care Campaign]] is a not-for-profit corporation created to help eradicate hospital acquired infections. Its goal is to instigate a national change in ideology and practices within the health care environment in regard to hand hygiene, by emphasizing well-established methods proven to result in safer patient care.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Infection Control: Frequently Asked Questions on Hand Hygiene|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=2005-04-21|url=https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/faq/hand.htm|accessdate=2007-01-07}}</ref>\n\n====United States Pharmacopeia====\nThe [[United States Pharmacopeia]] (USP) sets official standards for all prescription and over-the-counter medicines, dietary supplements, and other healthcare products manufactured and sold in the United States, but USP standards are also recognized and used in more than 130 other countries.

{"title_page": "Delwara", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n''History Before Medieval Period''\n__FORCETOC__\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town \u2013 Delwara ==\nDelwara, nestled in the Aravalli hills, is about 28&nbsp;km away from [[Udaipur]] and close to [[Eklingji]] Temple on way to temple town of [[Nathdwara]]. Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 which means the town of god, boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were about 400 Jain temples. The ancient Jain temples of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of Jain temples in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the Jain temples at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].<ref>Sharma, Suresh K.; Sharma, Usha (2004), Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Jainism, Mittal Publications, {{ISBN|978-81-7099-957-7}}</ref><ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samprati Samprati - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aayad were the centers of learning and culture before 15th century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to Nagda. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><br>\nAs on 2017, three main Jain temples remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of Rishabhdevbhagwan and one of Parshvnathbhagwan. Jain temples at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, Rishabhdev and Parshvnath. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 Tirthankara with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen Vidya-devis (goddesses of knowledge) are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why Jain temples at [[Mt. Abu]] are called Dilwara Jain temples? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\"/> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the Solanki rulers of Gujaratvisited these temples during 11th and 13th centuries ADand were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the Jain temples. Vimal Shah,the minister, governor of Chandravati and commander in chief of Bhimadev I (1022\u201364), the Solanki ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near Mount Abu which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. The temple is known as Vimal Vasahi (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of a Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the Jain temples designed after Vimal Vasahi temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11th and 13th century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as Dilwara (Delwara) Jain temples. The Dilwara temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara (Mewar).\n\n== Arrival of Chauhans to Aravalli\u2019s of South West [[Rajasthan]] ==\nThe Chauhans during 11th century founded Amber, [[Sambhar]] and [[Ajmer]] in Rajputana. The last of them, Vigraha Raja or Rao Bisaldeo, in the middle of the 12th century extended the ancestral dominions considerably and conquered [[Delhi]] from a chief of the Tomara clan. At that time, according to their own bard, the dominions of the Chauhans extended north to Hissar and south to the [[Aravalli]] hills. After Prithviraj Chauhan III was killed in a battle in 1192, the Chauhan kingdom was broken up. <br>\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized Nadol (near Jodhpur) from the Paramaras and established himself there toward the end of the 10th century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan Qutbud-din Aibak of Delhi, during the 12th century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to Bhinmal and Sanchor, before seizing Jalore from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipalwas progenitor of Songara clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref>Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref><br>\nChauhans have 26 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of Jalore, Chandravati and Sirohi belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.<br>\n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar(now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Kshem Singh or Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to Dungarpur. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. Jagirdars of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><br>\n<blockquote> ''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle. Samant Singh went to Vagad and established Dungarpur state. Later Rawal Kumar Singh, younger brother of Rawal Samant Singh, recaptured Ahar, the capital of Mewar\u201d.'' </blockquote>\nThis fact is also established by the existence of an Ashapura temple on a hill top at village Berwas, between Ahar and Debari region of Udaipur.

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra.

Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15th Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle.

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 which means the town of god, boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were about 400 Jain temples. The ancient Jain temples of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka\u2019s blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of Jain temples in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the Jain temples at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].<ref>Sharma, Suresh K.; Sharma, Usha (2004), Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Jainism, Mittal Publications, {{ISBN|978-81-7099-957-7}}</ref><ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samprati Samprati - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aayad were the centers of learning and culture before 15th century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to Nagda. Today only 25 % of the original town remains.<ref> Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><br>\nAs on 2017, three main Jain temples remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of Rishabhdevbhagwan and one of Parshvnathbhagwan. Jain temples at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, Rishabhdev and Parshvnath. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 Tirthankara with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen Vidya-devis (goddesses of knowledge) are carved on the ceiling. <br>\n=== Why Jain temples at [[Mt. Abu]] are called Dilwara Jain temples? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the Solanki rulers of Gujaratvisited these temples during 11th and 13th centuries ADand were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the Jain temples. Vimal Shah,the minister, governor of Chandravati and commander in chief of Bhimadev I (1022-64), the Solanki ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near Mount Abu which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. The temple is known as Vimal Vasahi (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of a Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the Jain temples designed after Vimal Vasahi temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11th and 13th century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as Dilwara (Delwara) Jain temples. The Dilwara temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara (Mewar).\n\n== Arrival of Chauhans to Aravalli\u2019s of South West [[Rajasthan]] ==\nThe Chauhans during 11th century founded Amber, [[Sambhar]] and [[Ajmer]] in Rajputana. The last of them, Vigraha Raja or Rao Bisaldeo, in the middle of the 12th century extended the ancestral dominions considerably and conquered [[Delhi]] from a chief of the Tomara clan. At that time, according to their own bard, the dominions of the Chauhans extended north to Hissar and south to the [[Aravalli]] hills. After Prithviraj Chauhan III was killed in a battle in 1192, the Chauhan kingdom was broken up. <br>\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized Nadol (near Jodhpur) from the Paramaras and established himself there toward the end of the 10th century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan Qutbud-din Aibak of Delhi, during the 12th century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to Bhinmal and Sanchor, before seizing Jalore from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipalwas progenitor of Songara clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref>Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi).

Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of Jalore, Chandravati and Sirohi belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.<br>\n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nIt is said that around 1172-80, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar(now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Kshem Singh or Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to Dungarpur. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. Jagirdars of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states, <ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><br>\n<blockquote> ''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle. Samant Singh went to Vagad and established Dungarpur state. Later Rawal Kumar Singh, younger brother of Rawal Samant Singh, recaptured Ahar, the capital of Mewar\u201d.'' </blockquote>\nThis fact is also established by the existence of an Ashapura temple on a hill top at village Berwas, between Ahar and Debari region of Udaipur. Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar\u2019s eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri KrishanJugnu, \u201cDebarimeans window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d.

It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref><br>\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn\u2019t find one. The prince\u2019s leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref> Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref>\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326-64), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan. Rawat Publications.</ref><br>\n=== Rana Shree Karan Sacrifices his Life for Mewar ===\nAfter Raja Bohitya,his eldest son Raja Shree Karan ascended the throne of Delwara. Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14th Century the soldiers of RanaShree Karan looted the treasury of Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk while his army was on a passage through Aravalli\u2019s from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Muhammad Bin Tughluk brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near Mandalgarh. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting MaharanaHamir Singh I.Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi. Mewar established their supremacy within 50 years of the sack of Chittorgarh and Maharana Hamir Singh I recaptured the Fort in 1353.<ref name=autogenerated2>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref> Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980). Karamchandra Vanshavali Prabandh (Sanskrit / Hindi). Singhi Granthmala, Bhartiya Vidhya Bhawan, Mumbai.</ref></blockquote>\nAfter the death of Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj\u2019s descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15th Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473-1509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509-1527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14th century till Jhalas came in 15th century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar? It is yet tobe researched and established.<br>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Uncategorized|date=April 2020}}\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: couldn\u2019t \u2192 couldn't, etc  \u2192 etc. , \u2019s \u2192 's (8), 1172-80 \u2192 1172\u201380", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delwara"}

G. Wodehouse]]\n}}\n\n'''Reginald Jeeves''', usually referred to as just '''Jeeves''', is a fictional character in a series of [[comedic]] short stories and novels by English author [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. Jeeves is the highly competent valet of a wealthy and idle young Londoner named [[Bertie Wooster]]. First appearing in print in 1915, Jeeves continued to feature in Wodehouse's work until his last completed novel ''[[Aunts Aren't Gentlemen]]'' in 1974, a span of 60 years.\n\nBoth the name \"Jeeves\" and the character of Jeeves have come to be thought of as the quintessential name and nature of a [[valet]] or [[butler]], inspiring many similar characters (as well as the name of the Internet search engine [[Ask.com|Ask Jeeves]], now simply called Ask.com). A \"Jeeves\" is now a generic term as validated by its entry in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oed.com/ |title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oed.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15}}</ref>\n\nJeeves is a valet, not a butler; that is, he is responsible for serving an individual, whereas a butler is responsible for a household and manages other servants. On rare occasions he fills in for someone else's butler. According to Bertie Wooster, he \"can buttle with the best of them.\"\n\n== Inspiration ==\nAn early prototype for Bertie Wooster is [[Reggie Pepper]], who was very much like Bertie Wooster but without Jeeves, though it was Jeeves who ultimately took the name \"Reggie\". A valet called Jevons appears in Wodehouse's 1914 short story \"Creatures of Impulse\", and may have been an early prototype for Jeeves.<ref name=cawthorne169>Cawthorne (2013), p. 169.</ref> Like Jeeves, Jevons is described as the perfect valet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.madameulalie.org/strand/Creatures_of_Impulse.html |title=Creatures of Impulse |last=Wodehouse |first=P. G. |date=October 1914 |website=Madame Eulalie |access-date=21 January 2018 |quote=What a treasure Jevons was! What a model of what a gentleman\u2019s servant should be! Existence without Jevons would be unthinkable.}}</ref> \"Creatures of Impulse\" appeared in ''The Strand Magazine'', and was not republished in any collection, though some parts went into the making of \"[[The Crime Wave at Blandings]]\".<ref>Usborne (2003), p. 82.</ref>\n\nIn his 1953 semi-autobiographical book written with [[Guy Bolton]], ''[[Bring on the Girls!]]'', Wodehouse suggested that the Jeeves character was inspired by an actual butler named Eugene Robinson whom Wodehouse employed for research purposes. Wodehouse described Robinson as a \"walking ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''\". However, Robinson worked at Wodehouse's house in Norfolk Street where Wodehouse did not live until 1927, long after Jeeves had been created.<ref name=cawthorne169 />\n\nWodehouse named his Jeeves after [[Percy Jeeves]] (1888\u20131916), a popular English cricketer for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]]. Wodehouse witnessed Percy Jeeves bowling at [[Cheltenham Cricket Festival]] in 1913. Percy Jeeves was killed at the [[Battle of the Somme]] during the attack on [[High Wood]] in July 1916, less than a year after the first appearance of the Wodehouse character who would make his name a household word.<ref name=Sarna>\"The most invaluable nugget contained in the book [''Wodehouse at the Wicket'' by P. G. Wodehouse and Murray Hedgcock] traces the origin of the name Jeeves to Percy Jeeves, a Warwickshire professional cricketer known for his impeccable grooming, smart shirts and spotlessly clean flannels. Wodehouse probably saw him take a couple of smooth, effortless catches in a match between Gloucestershire and Warwickshire. The name, the immaculate appearance and silent efficiency stuck and the inimitable manservant appeared first in 1916, just weeks after the original Percy Jeeves died in the war in France.\" {{cite journal|author = Navtej Sarna |title = Of Lords, aunts and pigs |journal= The Hindu Literary Review| date = June 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn a letter written in 1965, Wodehouse wrote that he had read [[Harry Leon Wilson]]'s ''Ruggles of Red Gap'' (first published as a magazine serial in 1914), which influenced the creation of Jeeves. ''Ruggles of Red Gap'' is a comedic novel about an English valet who is won by an American from an English earl in a poker game. In the letter, Wodehouse wrote, \"I felt that an English valet would never have been so docile about being handed over to an American in payment of a poker debt. I thought he had missed the chap's dignity. I think it was then that the idea of Jeeves came into my mind.\"<ref>{{cite book | author-last= Murphy | author-first= N. T. P. | title= The P. G.

His cousin Egbert is a constable and plays a role in the short story \"[[Without the Option]]\".<ref name=garrison96>Garrison (1991), pp. 96\u201398.</ref>\n\nJeeves has three placid aunts, in contrast to Bertie Wooster's aunts.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) (1971), ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 12, p. 126.</ref> Aunt Emily is interested in psychical research, and another aunt, Mrs. Pigott, owns a cat in Maiden Eggesford; this cat plays a major role in ''[[Aunts Aren't Gentlemen]]''. Jeeves occasionally references an aunt without naming her, including an aunt who read [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] to him when he was young.<ref>Ring & Jaggard (1999), p. 131.</ref> In ''[[Right Ho, Jeeves]]'', he references his Aunt Annie, though she was widely disliked.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 23, p. 288.</ref>\n\n=== Employment history ===\n\nIn his youth, Jeeves worked as a [[page (servant)|page boy]] at a girls' school. He apparently served in the military to some extent in [[World War I]].<ref>Cawthorne (2013), pp. 170\u2013173. When asked by Lord Rowcester if he was in the First World War, Jeeves claims he \"dabbled in it to a certain extent\".</ref> In the play ''[[Come On, Jeeves]]'', Jeeves states that he was a [[Batman (military)|batman]].\n\nShortly before entering Bertie's service, Jeeves was employed by Lord Frederick Ranelagh, who was swindled in [[Monte Carlo]].<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 46.</ref> Jeeves previously worked for [[Lord Worplesdon]], resigning after nearly a year because of Worplesdon's eccentric choice of evening dress.<ref name=\"auto\">Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 13.</ref> Jeeves later helps Lord Worplesdon in ''[[Joy in the Morning (Wodehouse novel)|Joy in the Morning]]''. Other former employers include Mr Digby Thistleton (later Lord Bridgnorth), who sold hair tonic;<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 2, p. 56-57 and chapter 4, p. 93.</ref> Mr Montague-Todd, a financier who is in the second year of a [[prison]] term when Jeeves mentions him;<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 10, p. 268.</ref> and Lord Brancaster, who gave [[port wine|port]]-soaked seedcake to his pet parrot.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 14, pp. 153\u2013154.</ref>\n\nJeeves becomes Bertie Wooster's valet. However, his tenure with Bertie Wooster has occasional lapses during the stories; at these times, Jeeves finds work elsewhere. Jeeves works for Lord Chuffnell for a week in ''[[Thank You, Jeeves]]'', after giving notice because of Bertie Wooster's unwillingness to give up the [[banjolele]], and is briefly employed by J. Washburn Stoker in the same novel. He serves as substitute butler for Bertie's [[Aunt Dahlia]] in ''[[Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves]]'', and later in the same story, he enters Sir [[Watkyn Bassett]]'s employment for a short time as a trick to get Bertie Wooster released from jail. Jeeves is Lord Rowcester's butler for the length of ''[[Ring for Jeeves]]''.<ref>Cawthorne (2013), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref>\n\nWhile working for Bertie Wooster, he occasionally pretends to be the valet of one of Bertie's friends as part of some scheme, though he is still actually Bertie's valet. He pretends to be the valet of Bicky Bickersteth in \"[[Jeeves and the Hard-boiled Egg]]\", [[List of Jeeves characters#Rockmetteller \"Rocky\" Todd|Rocky Todd]] in \"[[The Aunt and the Sluggard]]\", and [[Gussie Fink-Nottle]] when Gussie masquerades as Bertie Wooster in ''[[The Mating Season (novel)|The Mating Season]]''.<ref>Cawthorne (2013), p. 174.</ref> Jeeves acts as a bookmaker's clerk in ''[[Ring for Jeeves]]'', disguising himself for the role with a check suit and walrus moustache.<ref>Ring & Jaggard (1999), p. 137.</ref> In the play ''[[Come On, Jeeves]]'', which has mostly the same plot as ''Ring for Jeeves'', it is mentioned that Jeeves changed his appearance as a bookmaker's clerk, though in the play, Jeeves also impersonates a medieval ghost named Lady Agatha, wearing makeup and women's medieval clothing to complete the disguise. He pretends to be a broker's man in \"[[Jeeves and the Greasy Bird]]\" and Bertie's [[solicitor]] in ''[[Aunts Aren't Gentlemen]]''. In one instance, he pretends to be Bertie Wooster in a telephone conversation with playwright Percy Gorringe.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1954], ''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit'', chapter 3, pp. 36\u201337.</ref> In ''[[Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves]]'', he assumes an alias, calling himself Chief Inspector Witherspoon of [[Scotland Yard]]. This alias is also mentioned in ''[[Aunts Aren't Gentlemen]]''.\n\nJeeves is a member of the [[Junior Ganymede Club]], a London club for butlers and valets.\n\n=== The stories ===\n\nJeeves is first hired by Bertie in \"[[Jeeves Takes Charge]]\" to replace a valet whom Bertie had fired for stealing from him. In this short story, Bertie briefly fires Jeeves after Jeeves, who believes that Bertie would not be happy with his fianc\u00e9e [[Florence Craye]], takes steps to end Bertie's engagement to her. Bertie quickly rehires Jeeves after realizing that Jeeves was right. Thereafter, Jeeves lives with Bertie, usually in their London residence at [[P. G. Wodehouse locations#Berkeley Mansions|Berkeley Mansions]]. Over the course of the short stories and novels, Jeeves helps Bertie, frequently extricating him from unwanted engagements, and also assists Bertie's friends and relatives with various dilemmas. Jeeves often has another motive, such as disposing of an item recently acquired by Bertie that Jeeves does not like, for example a bright scarlet [[cummerbund]]. He sometimes receives a monetary reward from Bertie and other people he helps in early stories, though this does not occur in later stories.\n\nBertie and Jeeves experience a variety of adventures in numerous short stories and novels. Aside from changes in his employment status, some events occur that are particularly noteworthy for Jeeves. Jeeves gets engaged twice in \"[[Jeeves in the Springtime]]\", though he never references these fianc\u00e9es afterward, and it appears that he does not become engaged again.<ref>Usborne (2003), p. 91.</ref> In the only story Jeeves narrates, \"[[Bertie Changes His Mind]]\", he opposes Bertie's decision to live with his nieces. Jeeves and Bertie visit [[P. G. Wodehouse locations#Deverill Hall|Deverill Hall]], where Jeeves's Uncle Charlie is employed as butler, in ''[[The Mating Season (novel)|The Mating Season]]''. While away on his vacation in ''[[Jeeves in the Offing]]'', Jeeves is persuaded by a friend to judge a seaside bathing belle contest.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1960], ''Jeeves in the Offing'', chapter 11, pp. 111\u2013112.</ref>\n\nIn the novel ''[[Ring for Jeeves]]'', which is set after World War II, Jeeves temporarily works as Lord Rowcester's butler while Bertie is sent to a school where the idle rich learn to fend for themselves. This is the only story in which Jeeves appears without Bertie Wooster. The novel was adapted from the play ''[[Come On, Jeeves]]''.\n\nJeeves's first name was not revealed until the penultimate novel, ''[[Much Obliged, Jeeves]]''. Bertie Wooster learns Jeeves's name when he hears another valet greet Jeeves with \"Hullo, Reggie.\" The readers may have been surprised to learn Jeeves's first name, but Bertie was stunned by the revelation \"that he had a first name\" in the first place.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 38. \"'Hullo, Reggie,' he said, and I froze in my chair, stunned by the revelation that Jeeves's first name was Reginald. It had never occurred to me before that he had a first name\" (Bertie about Bingley greeting Jeeves).</ref><ref>In the 1937 film ''Step Lively, Jeeves'', Jeeves, portrayed by [[Arthur Treacher]], states his first name to be Rupert.  However, Wodehouse had nothing to do with the script of that film, and Treacher's Jeeves character is so unlike Wodehouse's Jeeves that the viewer could easily believe him to be a different Jeeves altogether.</ref> In the club book of Jeeves's club, the Junior Ganymede, all members must record the foibles of their employers to forewarn other butlers and valets. Bertie wants Jeeves to destroy his section. Jeeves is initially reluctant to defy his club's rules, but he eventually does destroy the pages for Bertie by the end of ''Much Obliged, Jeeves''.\n\nJeeves last appears in ''[[Aunts Aren't Gentlemen]]'', in which Jeeves and Bertie head to the rural village of Maiden Eggesford, though Jeeves wants to go to New York. He and Bertie visit New York at the end of the story.\n\n== Personal characteristics ==\n=== Age and appearance ===\n\nWhile Bertie Wooster is 24 years old in \"[[Jeeves Takes Charge]]\" (1916), Jeeves's age is not stated in the stories, and has been interpreted differently by various illustrators and adaptations. However, there are a few hints in the books regarding Jeeves's age. Jeeves has a long employment history, and he is older than Bertie Wooster.<ref>Wodehouse (1968) [1966], ''Plum Pie'', chapter 1, p. 46. Aunt Dahlia implies that Jeeves is \"maturer\" than Bertie.</ref> On the other hand, Jeeves is young enough to be engaged to a waitress courted by [[Bingo Little]], who is the same age as Bertie Wooster, in \"[[Jeeves in the Springtime]]\". In ''[[Ring for Jeeves]]'', Jeeves is described as resembling \"a youngish High Priest of a refined and dignified religion\".<ref>Wodeshouse (2008) [1953], ''Ring for Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 40.</ref>\n\nIn the reference work ''Wodehouse in Woostershire'' by Wodehouse scholars Geoffrey Jaggard and Tony Ring, it is speculated using information provided in the Jeeves canon that Bertie's age ranges from approximately 24 to 29 over the stories, and that Jeeves is roughly ten years older than Bertie, giving an age range of 35 to 40.<ref>Ring & Jaggard (1999), pp. 124\u2013126.</ref> This happens to agree with a personal letter written in 1961 by P. G. Wodehouse to scholar [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]], in which Wodehouse, explaining that his characters did not age with real life time, gave an approximate age for Jeeves:\n\n<blockquote>Keggs in ''[[A Damsel in Distress (novel)|A Damsel in Distress]]'' is supposed to be the same man who appears in ''[[Something Fishy|The Butler Did It]]'', but does it pan out all right? It doesn't if you go by when the books were written. The ''Damsel'' was published in 1919 and the ''Butler'' in 1957. But I always ignore real life time. After all, Jeeves\u2014first heard of at the age presumably of about thirty-five in 1916\u2014would now be around eighty-five, counting the real years.<ref>Hall (1974), pp. 16 and 19. Jeeves's first appearance was in \"Extricating Young Gussie\", which was published in 1915 the US. However, multiple Wodehouse reference books say that Jeeves first appeared in 1916, possibly because that is when he first appeared in both the US and the UK.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn appearance, Jeeves is described as \"tall and dark and impressive\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1953], ''Ring for Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 40.</ref> On multiple occasions, Bertie states that Jeeves has \"finely chiselled features\", and a large head, which seems to Bertie to indicate intelligence. As Bertie says, Jeeves is \"a godlike man in a bowler hat with grave, finely chiselled features and a head that stuck out at the back, indicating great brain power\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1949], ''The Mating Season'', chapter 23, pg. 219.</ref> Bertie also describes Jeeves's eyes as gleaming with intelligence.<ref name=garrison96 />\n\n=== Personality ===\n\nBertie frequently describes Jeeves as having a \"feudal spirit\". Jeeves aims to be helpful and will devote much time and effort to solving Bertie's personal problems despite not being obliged to do so. Demonstrating his loyalty to Bertie, Jeeves interrupts his vacation twice to come to Bertie's aid (in \"[[The Love That Purifies]]\" and ''[[Jeeves in the Offing]]''). He regularly rescues Bertie, usually from an unwanted marriage but also from other threats, such as when he saves Bertie from a hostile swan or when he pulls Bertie out of the way of a taxi.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 4, pp. 32\u201334.</ref> Proud of being a valet, Jeeves is evidently offended when a revolutionary tells him that servants are outdated in \"[[Comrade Bingo]]\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 12, p. 126.</ref>\n\nJeeves often shows sympathy for Bertie and others. He generally manipulates situations for the better and is described as \"a kindly man\" in ''Ring for Jeeves''.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1953], ''Ring for Jeeves'', chapter 19, p. 211.</ref>  However, he will influence Bertie's decisions to suit his own preferences, as when he causes Bertie to change his mind about living with his nieces in \"[[Bertie Changes His Mind]]\". Jeeves is also stubborn when opposing a new item that Bertie has taken a liking to, such as an alpine hat or purple socks. While he often stays on in spite of these radical objects, he can only withstand so much: the worst case is when he resigned after Bertie, privately labeling him as a \"domestic [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]\", resolved to study the banjolele in the countryside.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Thank You, Jeeves'', chapter 1.</ref> Usually, Jeeves finds a way to help Bertie with a problem, and Bertie agrees to give away the item that Jeeves disapproves of. Even when Bertie and Jeeves are having a disagreement, Jeeves still shows sympathy, as much as he shows any emotion, when Bertie is in serious trouble.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1963], ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 33. Bertie says regarding Jeeves, \"He and the young master may have had differences about Alpine hats with pink feathers in them, but when he sees the y.m. on the receiving end of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, he sinks his dudgeon and comes through with the feudal spirit at its best. So now, instead of being cold and distant and aloof, as a lesser man would have been, he showed the utmost agitation and concern. That is to say, he allowed one eyebrow to rise perhaps an eighth of an inch, which is as far as he ever goes in the way of expressing emotion.\"</ref>\n\nOften wearing \"an expression of quiet intelligence combined with a feudal desire to oblige\",<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Thank You, Jeeves'', chapter 5, p. 50.</ref> Jeeves consistently preserves the calm and courteous demeanor of a dutiful valet, and hardly displays any emotions. When he feels discomfort or is being discreet, he assumes an expressionless face which Bertie describes as resembling a \"stuffed moose\"<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 9, p. 94.</ref> or \"stuffed frog\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1954], ''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit'', chapter 12, p. 118 and chapter 21, p. 219.</ref> When very surprised, he will raise his eyebrow a small fraction of an inch, and when he is amused, the corner of his mouth twitches slightly.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1974], ''Aunts Aren't Gentlemen'', chapter 5, p. 46, and chapter 20, p. 182.</ref> His composure extends to his voice, which is soft and respectful.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 31.</ref> When he wishes to speak without having been spoken to or is about to discuss a delicate subject, he makes a low gentle cough \"like a very old sheep clearing its throat on a misty mountain top\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 11, p. 122.</ref> He may also cough to signify disapproval.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1963], ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves'', chapter 23, p. 191.</ref> Bertie states that he saw the normally imperturbable Jeeves come \"very near to being rattled\" for the first time when the sight of [[Bingo Little]] in a false beard caused Jeeves to drop his jaw and steady himself with a table in \"Comrade Bingo\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 12, p. 123&ndash;24.</ref> In ''[[Joy in the Morning (Wodehouse novel)|Joy in the Morning]]'', Bertie claims that the only occasion on which he had ever seen Jeeves \"really rattled\" was when he first met Bertie's friend Boko Fittleworth, who wears turtleneck sweaters and flannel trousers with a patch on the knee; Jeeves \"winced visibly and tottered off\" to recover his composure in the kitchen, where Bertie supposes Jeeves pulled himself together with cooking sherry.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1947], ''Joy in the Morning'', chapter 6, p. 52.</ref>\n\nBertie says that Jeeves is persuasive and magnetic. He notes that there is something about Jeeves that seems to soothe and hypnotize, making Jeeves effective at calming down an irate person.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 22, p. 269. Bertie describes Jeeves: \"He is magnetic. There is about him something that seems to soothe and hypnotize. To the best of my knowledge, he has never encountered a charging rhinoceros, but should this contingency occur, I have no doubt that the animal, meeting his eye, would check itself in mid-stride, roll over and lie purring with its legs in the air.\"</ref> He believes that Jeeves could convince a candidate standing for Parliament to vote against herself.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 8, p. 84.</ref> There is a poetic side to Jeeves, who recites a great deal of poetry. He is much affected when a parted couple reconciles, and tells Bertie that his heart leaps up when he beholds a rainbow in the sky.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1947], ''Joy in the Morning'', chapter 16, p. 154 and chapter 17, p. 161. Jeeves is probably quoting William Wordsworth's poem \"[[My Heart Leaps Up]]\".</ref>\n\nIt is not unusual for Bertie's acquaintances to ask for Jeeves's help directly without discussing it with Bertie, and Jeeves is willing to assist them even if Bertie is not involved in any way.<ref>Usborne (2003), p. 93.</ref> Bertie once says that Jeeves \"isn't so much a valet as a Mayfair consultant.\"<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1949], ''The Mating Season'', chapter 25, p. 245.</ref> On one occasion, Bertie considers it probable that even the distinguished Sir [[Roderick Glossop]] has consulted Jeeves, and says, \"Jeeves is like Sherlock Holmes. The highest in the land come to him with their problems. For all I know, they may give him jewelled snuff boxes.\"<ref>Wodehouse (1966), ''Plum Pie'', chapter 1, p. 15.</ref>\n\n=== Skills ===\nJeeves presents the ideal image of the gentlemanly manservant, being highly competent, dignified, and respectful. He speaks intelligently and correctly, using proper titles for members of the nobility. One of his skills is moving silently and unobtrusively from room to room. According to Bertie, Jeeves noiselessly \"floats\" and \"shimmers\";<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1938], ''The Code of the Woosters'', chapter 1, p. 1 and chapter 2, p. 28.</ref> Bertie once remarks, \"Presently I was aware that Jeeves was with me. I hadn't heard him come in, but you often don't with Jeeves. He just streams silently from spot A to spot B, like some gas\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1938], ''The Code of the Woosters'', chapter 6, p. 136.</ref> In addition to being a proficient valet, Jeeves can serve capably as a butler, and does so on a few occasions. As Bertie says in ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves'', \"If the call comes, he can buttle with the best of them.\"<ref name=cawthorne170>Cawthorne (2013), p. 170.</ref>\n\nIncredibly knowledgeable about topics ranging from horse racing to history, Jeeves has an encyclopedic knowledge of [[literature]] and [[Outline of academic disciplines|academic subjects]]. He frequently quotes from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and the [[Romanticism|romantic poets]]. Well informed about members of the British aristocracy thanks to the club book of the [[Junior Ganymede Club]], he also seems to have a considerable number of useful connections among various servants. Jeeves uses his knowledge and connections to solve problems inconspicuously.<ref>Cawthorne (2013), p. 173.</ref> [[Richard Usborne]], a leading scholar of the life and works of Wodehouse, describes Jeeves as a \"godlike prime mover\" and \"master brain who is found to have engineered the apparent coincidence or coincidences\".<ref>''Wodehouse at Work to the End'', Richard Usborne 1976.</ref> To form his plans, Jeeves often studies \"the psychology of the individual\" or the personality of one or more people involved in the situation.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1930], ''Very Good, Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 98. Jeeves says that studying \"the psychology of the individual\" is essential to solving problems, and that this means studying \"the natures and dispositions of the principals in the matter\".</ref> His mental prowess is attributed to eating fish, according to Bertie Wooster, who credits the phosphorus content in the fish with boosting Jeeves's brain power. Jeeves does not try to argue this claim, though at least once he says he does not eat a lot of fish,<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 5, p. 137.</ref> and in one conversation, Bertie states that he favours [[kippers]], while Jeeves prefers ham.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1949], ''The Mating Season'', chapter 8, p. 87.</ref>\n\nOne of Jeeves's greatest skills is making a special drink of his own invention, a strong beverage which momentarily stuns one's senses but is very effective in curing hangovers. Bertie first hires Jeeves after his hangover is cured by one of Jeeves's special drinks.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Not simply a hangover cure, the drink can also give energy to someone who needs it, yet calm down someone who is worked up.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1954], ''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit'', chapter 7, p. 65. \"It's a curious thing about those specials of Jeeves's, and one on which many revellers have commented, that while, as I mentioned earlier, they wake the sleeping tiger in you, they also work the other way round. I mean, if the tiger in you isn't sleeping but on the contrary up and doing with a heart for any fate, they lull you in. You come in like a lion, you take your snootful, and you got out like a lamb. Impossible to explain it, of course. One can merely state the facts.\"</ref> Dark in colour, Jeeves's special pick-me-up is composed of [[Worcester sauce]] (pronounced \"Wooster\" sauce), a raw egg, and red pepper according to Jeeves, though Bertie suspects that the drink consists of more than that.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 5, p. 48.</ref> Wodehouse mentions other ingredients in a personal letter he wrote late in his life, though the ingredients he stated in the letter are not referred to in the stories.<ref>Wodehouse (2011), ''P. G. Wodehouse: A Life in Letters'', p. 541. Wodehouse wrote: \"Jeeves's bracer does not contain dynamite as is generally supposed. It consists of lime juice, a lump of sugar, and one teaspoonful of [[Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo|Mulliner's ''Buck-U-Uppo'']]. This, it will be remembered, is the amount of the Buck-U-Uppo given to elephants in India to enable them to face tigers on tiger hunts with the necessary nonchalance.\"</ref> Additionally, Jeeves is capable of typing and writing [[shorthand]].<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 10, and chapter 16, p. 183.</ref>\n\nJeeves has knowledge in more dubious subjects as well. He is well-informed about how to steal paintings and kidnap dogs.<ref>Wodehouse (1993) [1959], ''A Few Quick Ones'', chapter 4, p. 79. Jeeves tells Bertie how to steal a painting with treacle and brown paper, and says that this is \"the recognized method in vogue in the burgling industry\".</ref><ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1930], ''Very Good, Jeeves'', chapter 5, pp. 125\u2013126. Jeeves tells Bertie how to lure a dog using aniseed, and says that it is extensively used in the dog-stealing industry.</ref> He uses a [[Mickey Finn (drugs)|Mickey Finn]] to incapacitate the unscrupulous [[List of Jeeves characters#Rupert Bingley|Bingley]].<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 11, p. 123.</ref> Capable of violence when the situation calls for it, Jeeves uses a golf club to knock out Sippy Sipperley in \"[[The Inferiority Complex of Old Sippy]]\", and takes down a swan with a raincoat and boathook in \"[[Jeeves and the Impending Doom]]\". He finds it necessary to get Aunt Dahlia to knock out Bertie with a gong stick in \"[[Jeeves Makes an Omelette]]\", though he agrees with Bertie not to use this sort of tactic again.<ref>Wodehouse (1993) [1959], ''A Few Quick Ones'', chapter 4, p. 89.</ref><ref>Thompson (1992), p. 131. \"Certainly Jeeves never uses violence against Bertie, though he does\u2014regretfully\u2014get Aunt Dahlia to knock him out as part of the solution in 'Jeeves Makes an Omelet'.\"</ref> After Jeeves uses a cosh to knock out Constable Dobbs in ''[[The Mating Season (novel)|The Mating Season]]'', an astonished Bertie describes Jeeves as \"something that would be gratefully accepted as a muscle guy by any gang on the lookout for new blood\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1949], ''The Mating Season'', chapter 24, p. 235.</ref>\n\n=== Hobbies ===\n\nJeeves often reads intellectual, \"improving\" books, including the works of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Shakespeare]], and \"[[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]] and the great Russians\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 7, p. 72. Bertie says, \"'You want me to recommend you a good book? Well, of course, it depends on what you like. Jeeves, for instance, is never happier than when curled up with his Spinoza or his Shakespeare.'\"</ref><ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1954], ''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit'', chapter 1, p. 11. \"'My personal tastes lie more in the direction of Dostoevsky and the great Russians.'\"</ref> He also enjoys the works of romance novelist [[Rosie M. Banks]],<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 19.</ref> and regularly reads ''[[The Times]]'', which Bertie occasionally borrows to try the crossword puzzle.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1960], ''Jeeves in the Offing'', chapter 2, p. 25.</ref> In \"[[Jeeves in the Springtime]]\", he went dancing in Camberwell, where he was seen by Bertie's friend Bingo Little. Bingo says that he saw Jeeves \"swinging a dashed efficient shoe\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 15.</ref> Once a week, Jeeves takes the afternoon off to play [[contract bridge|bridge]] at his club, the Junior Ganymede.<ref>Wodehouse (1968) [1966], ''Plum Pie'', chapter 1, p. 32.</ref>\n\nOne of Jeeves's hobbies is fishing, which he tends to do during his annual summer holiday. Bertie sees him fishing in ''[[Joy in the Morning (Wodehouse novel)|Joy in the Morning]]''.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1947], ''Joy in the Morning'', chapter 20, p. 184.</ref> Appreciating travel in general, Jeeves wants to go on a cruise in two different stories, \"[[The Spot of Art]]\" and ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. Jeeves claims that travel is educational, though Bertie suspects that Jeeves has a Viking strain and \"yearns for the tang of the salt breezes\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1938], ''The Code of the Woosters'', chapter 1, p. 9.</ref> Jeeves occasionally enjoys gambling, which is the reason he wishes to go to Monte Carlo in \"[[Jeeves and the Yule-tide Spirit]]\".\n\n== Relationship with Bertie Wooster ==\nThe premise of the Jeeves stories is that the brilliant [[valet]] is firmly in control of his rich and unworldly young employer's life. Jeeves becomes Bertie Wooster's guardian and all-purpose problem solver, devising subtle plans to help Bertie and his friends with various problems. In particular, Jeeves extricates Bertie Wooster from engagements to formidable women whom Bertie reluctantly becomes engaged to, Bertie being unwilling to hurt a woman's feelings by turning her down. While Jeeves wants to keep Bertie from a fianc\u00e9e whom he believes will not make Bertie happy, Jeeves also wants to keep his position, which he feels would be threatened by a wife.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 36. In \"Jeeves Takes Charge\", Bertie fires Jeeves after Jeeves causes Florence to end her engagement to Bertie. Jeeves explains his actions: \"'As I am no longer in your employment, sir, I can speak freely without appearing to take a liberty. In my opinion you and Lady Florence were quite unsuitably matched... You would not have been happy, sir!'\"</ref><ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 10, p. 256. Upset that Bertie appears to be contemplating marriage, Jeeves states that, in his experience, \"when the wife comes in at the front door the valet of bachelor days goes out at the back\".</ref> Jeeves also provides assistance when Bertie, who refuses to let a pal down, gets drawn into trouble trying to help a friend or a relative he is fond of. Bertie is usually unaware of the extent of Jeeves's machinations until all is revealed at the end of the story. On one occasion, Bertie acknowledges and accepts his role as a pawn in Jeeves's grand plan, though Jeeves objects, saying that he could have accomplished nothing without Bertie's cooperation.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Thank You, Jeeves'', chapter 22, pp. 259\u2013260.</ref>\n\nFor the most part, Bertie and Jeeves are on good terms. Being fond of Bertie, Jeeves considers their connection \"pleasant in every respect\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 10, pp. 256 and 266.</ref> Bertie says that he looks on Jeeves as \"a sort of guide, philosopher, and friend\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 10. This is a reference to a poem by Alexander Pope.</ref> At times when Bertie is separated from Jeeves, Bertie is miserable. When Bertie must stay by himself in a hotel in \"[[The Aunt and the Sluggard]]\", he struggles without having Jeeves there to press his clothes and bring him tea, saying \"I don't know when I've felt so rotten. Somehow I found myself moving about the room softly, as if there had been a death in the family\"; he later cheers himself up by going round the cabarets, though \"the frightful loss of Jeeves made any thought of pleasure more or less a mockery\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 5, pp. 125\u2013126 and 130.</ref> In ''[[Thank You, Jeeves]]'', when Jeeves has left Bertie's employment because of their disagreement over a banjolele, Bertie still seeks Jeeves for help and Jeeves comes to his aid.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Thank You, Jeeves'', chapter 15, p. 173.</ref> Bertie dislikes when Jeeves goes on his annual holiday, stating, \"without this right-hand man at his side Bertram Wooster becomes a mere shadow his former self\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1954], ''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit'', chapter 1, p. 8.</ref> Jeeves appreciates the praise that Bertie bestows on him, saying that \"Mr. Wooster has always been gratifyingly appreciative of my humble efforts on his behalf\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1953], ''Ring for Jeeves'', chapter 5, p. 61.</ref>\n\nJeeves has firm ideas about how an English gentleman should dress and behave, and sees it as his duty to ensure that his employer presents himself appropriately. When friction arises between Jeeves and Bertie, it is usually over some new item about which Bertie Wooster is enthusiastic that does not meet with Jeeves's approval, such as bright purple socks, a white mess jacket, or a garish vase. Bertie becomes attached to these less conservative pieces and views Jeeves's opposition to them as \"hidebound and reactionary\",<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 1, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> marking him \"an enemy to Progress\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 16, p. 210.</ref> This type of disagreement results in a period of coolness between them. The conflict is resolved by the end of the story, typically after Jeeves has helped Bertie with his latest problem. Bertie, grateful, agrees to have it Jeeves's way. He does not object if he learns that Jeeves, foreseeing that Bertie would agree to give up the item, has already disposed of it.\n\nBertie considers Jeeves to be a marvel, and wonders why Jeeves is content to work for him, stating, \"It beats me sometimes why a man with his genius is satisfied to hang around pressing my clothes and what not\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 2, p. 45.</ref> Jeeves has been offered twice the salary Bertie pays him by another gentleman, but still remains with Bertie.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 84.</ref> Jeeves views Bertie as being friendly but mentally negligible, though his opinion of Bertie's intelligence seems to improve over time. In an early story, he says that Bertie is \"an exceedingly pleasant and amiable young gentleman, but not intelligent. By no means intelligent. Mentally he is negligible \u2013 quite negligible.\"<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 5, p. 55.</ref> Hearing this spurs Bertie to try to solve problems on his own, though he ultimately fails and needs Jeeves's assistance. Nonetheless, Jeeves's view of Bertie's intelligence has apparently softened by the first novel, when Jeeves says that Bertie \"is, perhaps, mentally somewhat negligible, but he has a heart of gold\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Thank You, Jeeves'', chapter 7, p. 82.</ref> At one point in the ninth novel, Jeeves actually commends Bertie's quick thinking, saying that Bertie's tactic of hiding from an antagonist behind a sofa \"showed a resource and swiftness of thought which it would be difficult to overpraise\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1963], ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves'', chapter 21, p. 178.</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nIn the twenty-first century, a \"[[wikt:Jeeves|Jeeves]]\" is a generic term for any useful and reliable person, found in dictionaries such as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''<ref>{{cite web\n | author      = Ring, Tony\n | date        = c. 2000 <!--NO DATE GIVEN, ARTICLE CITES SOME \"1999\" BOOKS-->\n | title       = Jeeves and Wooster March Into The Twenty-first Century\n | work        = Wodehouse.ru <!-- NOT SOURCE GIVEN BY WODEHOUSE.RU -->\n | url         = http://wodehouse.ru/march.htm\n | accessdate  = 2007-08-15\n | quote       = The frequency with which the term 'Jeeves' is used without further explanation in the media of today, and its inclusion as a generic term in the Oxford English Dictionary, suggests that P G Wodehouse's Jeeves, together with his principal employer Bertie Wooster, remain the most popular of his many enduring characters.\n}}</ref> or the ''[[Encarta Webster's Dictionary|Encarta World English Dictionary]]''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |author=Encarta World English Dictionary\n |date=2007\n |title=Jeeves\n |work=Encarta.msn.com\n |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/Jeeves.html\n |accessdate=2007-08-15\n |quote=Jeeves [ jeevz ], noun \u2013 Definition: resourceful helper: a useful and reliable person who provides ready solutions to problems ( informal ) [Mid-20th century. < a character in the novels of P.

With minor exceptions, the short stories were written and published first (between 1915 and 1930); the novels later (between 1934 and 1974). While the series of stories featuring the character of Jeeves are often referred to as the \"Jeeves\" stories, the series is also called by other names such as the \"Jeeves and Wooster\" or \"Jeeves and Bertie\" stories.\n\nBertie Wooster narrates (in the [[First-person narrative|first person]]) all the stories but two, \"[[Bertie Changes His Mind]]\" (which Jeeves himself narrates in the [[First-person narrative|first person]]), and ''[[Ring for Jeeves]]'' (which features Jeeves but not Bertie Wooster and is written in the [[Third-person narrative#Third-person|third person]]).\n\nJeeves and Bertie first appeared in \"[[Extricating Young Gussie]]\", a short story published in the US in September 1915, though it was not seen in the UK until 1916. In the story, Jeeves's character is minor and not fully developed, and Bertie's surname appears to be Mannering-Phipps. The first fully recognisable Jeeves and Wooster story was \"Leave It to Jeeves\", published in early 1916.  As the series progressed, Jeeves assumed the role of Bertie Wooster's co-protagonist. Most of the Jeeves stories were originally published as magazine pieces before being collected into books, although 11 of the short stories were reworked and divided into 18 chapters to make an episodic semi-novel called ''The Inimitable Jeeves''.  Other collections, most notably ''The World of Jeeves'', restore these to their original form of 11 distinct stories.\n\n* ''[[The Man with Two Left Feet]]'' (1917) \u2013 One story in a book of thirteen\n** \"[[Extricating Young Gussie]]\" \u2013 The first appearances of Jeeves and Bertie, originally published 1915-9-18 in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wodehouse.ru/bibssty.htm |title= Bibliography of short stories |author= The Russian Wodehouse Society  |access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref>\n* ''[[My Man Jeeves]]'' (1919) \u2013 Four stories in a book of eight, all four reprinted in the 1925 collection ''Carry On, Jeeves''.

''The Cat-nappers'')\n\nThe collection ''The World of Jeeves'' (first published in 1967, reprinted in 1988) contains all of the Jeeves short stories (with the exception of \"Extricating Young Gussie\") presented more or less in narrative chronological order, but with some variations from the originals.\n\nAn efficient method of reading the entire Jeeves canon is to read ''The World of Jeeves'', followed by the eleven novels in order of publication. The novels generally mention characters and events that happened in previous stories. Another way of reading most of the Jeeves canon is to read the short story collections ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', ''Carry On, Jeeves'', and ''Very Good, Jeeves'', followed by the novels. While ''Carry On, Jeeves'' features some earlier stories, it also includes stories that occur after events in ''The Inimitable Jeeves''.\n\nTwo \"pastiche\" Jeeves and Wooster novels have been authorized by the Wodehouse estate:  ''Jeeves and the Wedding Bells'' (2013) by [[Sebastian Faulks]] and ''Jeeves and the King of Clubs'' (2018) by [[Ben Schott]].\n\n===Setting and timeline===\n\nThe short stories are set primarily in London, where Bertie Wooster has a flat and is a member of the raucous [[Drones Club]], or in [[New York City]], though some short stories are set around various stately homes in the English countryside. The novels all take place at or near an English country house, most commonly [[Brinkley Court]] (in four novels) and [[Totleigh Towers]] (in two novels).\n\nThe Jeeves stories are described as occurring within a few years of each other. For example, Bertie states in ''[[Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit]]'' (1954) that his Aunt Dahlia has been running her paper ''Milady's Boudoir'', first introduced in \"[[Clustering Round Young Bingo]]\" (1925), for about three years.<ref>''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit'', chapter 5, p. 45.</ref> However, there are inconsistencies between the stories that make it difficult to construct a timeline. For instance, it is stated in ''[[Jeeves in the Offing]]'' that Aunt Dahlia ran her paper for four years, and not three, as is shown in ''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit''. Nonetheless, some scholars have attempted to create a rough timeline. [[J. H. C. Morris]] suggested that the Jeeves canon spanned approximately five years, stating that four Christmases are accounted for, and another must have passed during Bertie's time in America in the early stories, making five in all.<ref>Morris (1981), p. 4.</ref> Writer [[Kristin Thompson]] also suggested that approximately five years passed during the stories, though Thompson instead relied on explicit references to time passed between events in the series.<ref>Thompson (1992), pp. 340\u2013341.</ref>\n\nThe stories follow a [[floating timeline]], with each story being set at the time it was written, while the characters do not change and past events are referred to as happening recently. This results in the stories following \"two kinds of time\", as the characters hardly age but are seen against the background of a changing world.<ref>French (1966), p. 95.</ref> This floating timeline allows for comedic references to films, songs, and politicians that would have been well known to readers when the stories were written. For example, in ''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit'' (1954), when Bertie is surprised to hear that his Aunt Dahlia wants to sell her weekly paper, he remarks, \"It was like hearing that Rodgers had decided to sell Hammerstein.\"<ref>Thompson (1992), pp. 343\u2013344. \"Dozens of references to contemporary events and personalities give the series its second kind of time, with the world changing around the unaging characters.\"</ref> (This is a reference to [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], who created popular Broadway musicals in the 1940s and 1950s.) However, certain [[Edwardian era]] elements, such as aristocratic country houses and traditional gentlemen's clubs like the Drones Club, continue to be prevalent throughout the series, despite becoming less common in the real world.<ref>French (1966), p. 73.</ref>\n\nThe setting is generally an idealised version of the world, with international conflicts being downplayed or ignored. Illness and injuries cause negligible harm, similar to downplayed injuries in stage comedy.<ref>Hall (1974), p. 45.</ref>\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n=== Television ===\n* ''[[The World of Wooster]]'' (30 May 1965 to 17 November 1967, 20 episodes of 30 minutes) was a half-hour comedy series for [[BBC1]], with [[Dennis Price]] as Jeeves, and [[Ian Carmichael]] as Bertie Wooster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/27224|title=P G Wodehouse's The World of Wooster|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=5 December 2010}}</ref>\n* In the 1970s and 1980s, Jeeves and Bertie Wooster were portrayed by various actors in twelve commercials for Croft Original Sherry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.warc.com/content/article/ipa/croft_original_one_instinctively_knows_when_something_is_right/4405|last=Haslam|first=Melanie|title=Croft Original Sherry Commercial: [Jeeves and Wooster]|date=1990|publisher= |website= WARC|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref> One 1973 advertisement featured [[Jeremy Irons]] as Bertie Wooster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hatads.org.uk/catalogue/record/4f75737d-980d-4e67-9e29-7b417de5fd7a|title=Croft Original 'One Instinctively Knows When Something Is Right'|publisher=History of Advertising Trust |website= HAT Ads|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref>\n* In the 1981 [[BBC Two]] documentary ''Thank You, P.

In contrast to the 1930s films featuring Arthur Treacher, the scripts for this series by [[Clive Exton]] have been praised for their fidelity to Wodehouse's original vision although there are some departures. Notably, in the episode \"[[The Delayed Arrival]]\", Jeeves wears women's clothing and makeup in order to impersonate the novelist [[List of Jeeves characters#Daphne Dolores Morehead|Daphne Dolores Morehead]], which he does not do in the story on which the episode was based, ''[[Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit]]''. Also, the series uses Hugh Laurie's ability to sing and play [[boogie woogie]] piano by having Bertie perform such songs accompanied by Jeeves, something that does not occur in the stories.\n\n=== Film ===\n* In 1919, two silent short comedy films, \"Making Good with Mother\" and \"Cutting Out Venus\", were released in the US. These shorts were inspired by the [[Reggie Pepper]] stories and directed by [[Lawrence C. Windom]]. Reggie Pepper, a prototype for Bertie Wooster, was given a manservant named \"Jeeves\" who was a reformed burglar. The shorts featured [[Lawrence Grossmith]] as Reggie Pepper and [[Charles Coleman (actor)|Charles Coleman]] as Jeeves.<ref>Taves (2006), pp. 16 and 150.</ref>\n* ''[[Thank You, Jeeves!]]'' (1936) was the first film to feature Jeeves and Bertie, with [[Arthur Treacher]] as Jeeves and [[David Niven]] as Bertie Wooster. In the film, they meet a girl and help her brother stop two spies trying to get his secret plans. The film has almost nothing to do with the book of that title.  Treacher was associated with butler and manservant roles, having played such parts in several previous films, including the [[Shirley Temple]] film ''Curly Top'' (1935). In this case, however, the script called on him to play the character as unhelpful, pompous and rather unpleasant, with none of the trademark brilliance of the literary Jeeves.\n* ''[[Step Lively, Jeeves!]]'' (1937) also featured [[Arthur Treacher]] as Jeeves. Two swindlers con Jeeves into claiming he has a fortune waiting for him in America, where Jeeves meets some gangsters. Bertie Wooster does not appear, Jeeves is portrayed as a naive bumbler, and the film has nothing to do with any Wodehouse story. Wodehouse was disappointed with the two Treacher films.<ref>Taves (2006), pp. 74\u201381.</ref>\n* ''[[By Jeeves]]'' (2001) was a recorded performance of the musical, released as a video (with British actor [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] as Jeeves and American actor John Scherer as Bertie Wooster). It also aired on television.\n\n=== Radio ===\n* \"Leave It To Jeeves\" (1940) was an episode of the American [[CBS]] radio series ''Forecast''. Despite its title, the episode was not based on the Wodehouse short story originally titled \"[[The Artistic Career of Corky|Leave it to Jeeves]]\". It featured an original story set in New York. In the radio drama, Bertie tries to help his friend [[Bingo Little]] end his engagement to a woman named Gloria, and inadvertently gets engaged to Gloria himself, while Jeeves dislikes Bertie's new yellow spats. Jeeves rescues Bertie from his engagement, and a grateful Bertie allows Jeeves to dispose of the spats. [[Alan Mowbray]] portrayed Jeeves and [[Edward Everett Horton]] portrayed Bertie Wooster.

Wodehouse]]. Jeeves is the highly competent valet of a wealthy and idle young Londoner named [[Bertie Wooster]]. First appearing in print in 1915, Jeeves continued to feature in Wodehouse's work until his last completed novel ''[[Aunts Aren't Gentlemen]]'' in 1974, a span of 60 years.\n\nBoth the name \"Jeeves\" and the character of Jeeves have come to be thought of as the quintessential name and nature of a [[valet]] or [[butler]], inspiring many similar characters (as well as the name of the Internet search engine [[Ask.com|Ask Jeeves]], now simply called Ask.com). A \"Jeeves\" is now a generic term as validated by its entry in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oed.com/ |title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oed.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15}}</ref>\n\nJeeves is a valet, not a butler; that is, he is responsible for serving an individual, whereas a butler is responsible for a household and manages other servants. On rare occasions he fills in for someone else's butler. According to Bertie Wooster, he \"can buttle with the best of them.\"\n\n== Inspiration ==\nAn early prototype for Bertie Wooster is [[Reggie Pepper]], who was very much like Bertie Wooster but without Jeeves, though it was Jeeves who ultimately took the name \"Reggie\". A valet called Jevons appears in Wodehouse's 1914 short story \"Creatures of Impulse\", and may have been an early prototype for Jeeves.<ref name=cawthorne169>Cawthorne (2013), p. 169.</ref> Like Jeeves, Jevons is described as the perfect valet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.madameulalie.org/strand/Creatures_of_Impulse.html |title=Creatures of Impulse |last=Wodehouse |first=P.

Existence without Jevons would be unthinkable.}}</ref> \"Creatures of Impulse\" appeared in ''The Strand Magazine'', and was not republished in any collection, though some parts went into the making of \"[[The Crime Wave at Blandings]]\".<ref>Usborne (2003), p. 82.</ref>\n\nIn his 1953 semi-autobiographical book written with [[Guy Bolton]], ''[[Bring on the Girls!]]'', Wodehouse suggested that the Jeeves character was inspired by an actual butler named Eugene Robinson whom Wodehouse employed for research purposes. Wodehouse described Robinson as a \"walking ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''\". However, Robinson worked at Wodehouse's house in Norfolk Street where Wodehouse did not live until 1927, long after Jeeves had been created.<ref name=cawthorne169 />\n\nWodehouse named his Jeeves after [[Percy Jeeves]] (1888\u20131916), a popular English cricketer for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]]. Wodehouse witnessed Percy Jeeves bowling at Cheltenham Cricket Festival in 1913. Percy Jeeves was killed at the [[Battle of the Somme]] during the attack on [[High Wood]] in July 1916, less than a year after the first appearance of the Wodehouse character who would make his name a household word.<ref name=Sarna>\"The most invaluable nugget contained in the book [''Wodehouse at the Wicket'' by P. G. Wodehouse and Murray Hedgcock] traces the origin of the name Jeeves to Percy Jeeves, a Warwickshire professional cricketer known for his impeccable grooming, smart shirts and spotlessly clean flannels. Wodehouse probably saw him take a couple of smooth, effortless catches in a match between Gloucestershire and Warwickshire. The name, the immaculate appearance and silent efficiency stuck and the inimitable manservant appeared first in 1916, just weeks after the original Percy Jeeves died in the war in France.\" {{cite journal|author = Navtej Sarna |title = Of Lords, aunts and pigs |journal= The Hindu Literary Review| date = June 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn a letter written in 1965, Wodehouse wrote that he had read [[Harry Leon Wilson]]'s ''Ruggles of Red Gap'' (first published as a magazine serial in 1914), which influenced the creation of Jeeves. ''Ruggles of Red Gap'' is a comedic novel about an English valet who is won by an American from an English earl in a poker game. In the letter, Wodehouse wrote, \"I felt that an English valet would never have been so docile about being handed over to an American in payment of a poker debt. I thought he had missed the chap's dignity. I think it was then that the idea of Jeeves came into my mind.\"<ref>{{cite book | author-last= Murphy | author-first= N. T. P. | title= The P. G.

According to Jeeves, he was privately educated,<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1960], ''Jeeves in the Offing'', chapter 2, p. 19.</ref> and his mother thought him intelligent.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1930], ''Very Good, Jeeves'', chapter 5, p. 128.</ref>\n\nJeeves has an uncle, [[List of Jeeves characters#Charlie Silversmith|Charlie Silversmith]], who is butler at [[P. G. Wodehouse locations#Deverill Hall|Deverill Hall]]. Silversmith dandled Jeeves on his knee frequently when Jeeves was very young, and when Jeeves is an adult, they write regularly to each other.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1949], ''The Mating Season'', chapter 8, p. 86.</ref><ref>Wodehouse (2008) (1971), ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 10 and chapter 15, p. 161.</ref> Charlie Silversmith's daughter Queenie Silversmith is Jeeves's cousin. Jeeves also mentions his late uncle Cyril in ''[[Right Ho, Jeeves]]''. His niece Mabel is engaged to Bertie Wooster's friend [[List of Jeeves characters#Charles \"Biffy\" Biffen|Charles \"Biffy\" Biffen]]. His cousin Egbert is a constable and plays a role in the short story \"[[Without the Option]]\".<ref name=garrison96>Garrison (1991), pp. 96\u201398.</ref>\n\nJeeves has three placid aunts, in contrast to Bertie Wooster's aunts.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) (1971), ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 12, p. 126.</ref> Aunt Emily is interested in psychical research, and another aunt, Mrs. Pigott, owns a cat in Maiden Eggesford; this cat plays a major role in ''[[Aunts Aren't Gentlemen]]''. Jeeves occasionally references an aunt without naming her, including an aunt who read [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] to him when he was young.<ref>Ring & Jaggard (1999), p. 131.</ref> In ''[[Right Ho, Jeeves]]'', he references his Aunt Annie, though she was widely disliked.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 23, p. 288.</ref>\n\n=== Employment history ===\n\nIn his youth, Jeeves worked as a [[page (servant)|page boy]] at a girls' school. He apparently served in the military to some extent in [[World War I]].<ref>Cawthorne (2013), pp. 170\u2013173. When asked by Lord Rowcester if he was in the First World War, Jeeves claims he \"dabbled in it to a certain extent\".</ref> In the play ''[[Come On, Jeeves]]'', Jeeves states that he was a [[Batman (military)|batman]].\n\nShortly before entering Bertie's service, Jeeves was employed by Lord Frederick Ranelagh, who was swindled in [[Monte Carlo]].<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 46.</ref> Jeeves previously worked for [[Lord Worplesdon]], resigning after nearly a year because of Worplesdon's eccentric choice of evening dress.<ref name=\"auto\">Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 13.</ref> Jeeves later helps Lord Worplesdon in ''[[Joy in the Morning (Wodehouse novel)|Joy in the Morning]]''. Other former employers include Mr Digby Thistleton (later Lord Bridgnorth), who sold hair tonic;<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 2, p. 56-57 and chapter 4, p. 93.</ref> Mr Montague-Todd, a financier who is in the second year of a [[prison]] term when Jeeves mentions him;<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 10, p. 268.</ref> and Lord Brancaster, who gave [[port wine|port]]-soaked seedcake to his pet parrot.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 14, pp. 153\u2013154.</ref>\n\nJeeves becomes Bertie Wooster's valet. However, his tenure with Bertie Wooster has occasional lapses during the stories; at these times, Jeeves finds work elsewhere. Jeeves works for Lord Chuffnell for a week in ''[[Thank You, Jeeves]]'', after giving notice because of Bertie Wooster's unwillingness to give up the [[banjolele]], and is briefly employed by J. Washburn Stoker in the same novel. He serves as substitute butler for Bertie's [[Aunt Dahlia]] in ''[[Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves]]'', and later in the same story, he enters Sir [[Watkyn Bassett]]'s employment for a short time as a trick to get Bertie Wooster released from jail. Jeeves is Lord Rowcester's butler for the length of ''[[Ring for Jeeves]]''.<ref>Cawthorne (2013), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref>\n\nWhile working for Bertie Wooster, he occasionally pretends to be the valet of one of Bertie's friends as part of some scheme, though he is still actually Bertie's valet. He pretends to be the valet of Bicky Bickersteth in \"[[Jeeves and the Hard-boiled Egg]]\", [[List of Jeeves characters#Rockmetteller \"Rocky\" Todd|Rocky Todd]] in \"[[The Aunt and the Sluggard]]\", and [[Gussie Fink-Nottle]] when Gussie masquerades as Bertie Wooster in ''[[The Mating Season (novel)|The Mating Season]]''.<ref>Cawthorne (2013), p. 174.</ref> Jeeves acts as a bookmaker's clerk in ''[[Ring for Jeeves]]'', disguising himself for the role with a check suit and walrus moustache.<ref>Ring & Jaggard (1999), p. 137.</ref> In the play ''[[Come On, Jeeves]]'', which has mostly the same plot as ''Ring for Jeeves'', it is mentioned that Jeeves changed his appearance as a bookmaker's clerk, though in the play, Jeeves also impersonates a medieval ghost named Lady Agatha, wearing makeup and women's medieval clothing to complete the disguise. He pretends to be a broker's man in \"[[Jeeves and the Greasy Bird]]\" and Bertie's [[solicitor]] in ''[[Aunts Aren't Gentlemen]]''. In one instance, he pretends to be Bertie Wooster in a telephone conversation with playwright Percy Gorringe.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1954], ''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit'', chapter 3, pp. 36\u201337.</ref> In ''[[Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves]]'', he assumes an alias, calling himself Chief Inspector Witherspoon of [[Scotland Yard]]. This alias is also mentioned in ''[[Aunts Aren't Gentlemen]]''.\n\nJeeves is a member of the [[Junior Ganymede Club]], a London club for butlers and valets.\n\n=== The stories ===\n\nJeeves is first hired by Bertie in \"[[Jeeves Takes Charge]]\" to replace a valet whom Bertie had fired for stealing from him. In this short story, Bertie briefly fires Jeeves after Jeeves, who believes that Bertie would not be happy with his fianc\u00e9e [[Florence Craye]], takes steps to end Bertie's engagement to her. Bertie quickly rehires Jeeves after realizing that Jeeves was right. Thereafter, Jeeves lives with Bertie, usually in their London residence at [[P. G. Wodehouse locations#Berkeley Mansions|Berkeley Mansions]]. Over the course of the short stories and novels, Jeeves helps Bertie, frequently extricating him from unwanted engagements, and also assists Bertie's friends and relatives with various dilemmas. Jeeves often has another motive, such as disposing of an item recently acquired by Bertie that Jeeves does not like, for example a bright scarlet [[cummerbund]]. He sometimes receives a monetary reward from Bertie and other people he helps in early stories, though this does not occur in later stories.\n\nBertie and Jeeves experience a variety of adventures in numerous short stories and novels. Aside from changes in his employment status, some events occur that are particularly noteworthy for Jeeves. Jeeves gets engaged twice in \"[[Jeeves in the Springtime]]\", though he never references these fianc\u00e9es afterward, and it appears that he does not become engaged again.<ref>Usborne (2003), p. 91.</ref> In the only story Jeeves narrates, \"[[Bertie Changes His Mind]]\", he opposes Bertie's decision to live with his nieces. Jeeves and Bertie visit [[P. G. Wodehouse locations#Deverill Hall|Deverill Hall]], where Jeeves's Uncle Charlie is employed as butler, in ''[[The Mating Season (novel)|The Mating Season]]''. While away on his vacation in ''[[Jeeves in the Offing]]'', Jeeves is persuaded by a friend to judge a seaside bathing belle contest.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1960], ''Jeeves in the Offing'', chapter 11, pp. 111\u2013112.</ref>\n\nIn the novel ''[[Ring for Jeeves]]'', which is set after World War II, Jeeves temporarily works as Lord Rowcester's butler while Bertie is sent to a school where the idle rich learn to fend for themselves. This is the only story in which Jeeves appears without Bertie Wooster. The novel was adapted from the play ''[[Come On, Jeeves]]''.\n\nJeeves's first name was not revealed until the penultimate novel, ''[[Much Obliged, Jeeves]]''. Bertie Wooster learns Jeeves's name when he hears another valet greet Jeeves with \"Hullo, Reggie.\" The readers may have been surprised to learn Jeeves's first name, but Bertie was stunned by the revelation \"that he had a first name\" in the first place.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 38. \"'Hullo, Reggie,' he said, and I froze in my chair, stunned by the revelation that Jeeves's first name was Reginald. It had never occurred to me before that he had a first name\" (Bertie about Bingley greeting Jeeves).</ref><ref>In the 1937 film ''Step Lively, Jeeves'', Jeeves, portrayed by [[Arthur Treacher]], states his first name to be Rupert.  However, Wodehouse had nothing to do with the script of that film, and Treacher's Jeeves character is so unlike Wodehouse's Jeeves that the viewer could easily believe him to be a different Jeeves altogether.</ref> In the club book of Jeeves's club, the Junior Ganymede, all members must record the foibles of their employers to forewarn other butlers and valets. Bertie wants Jeeves to destroy his section. Jeeves is initially reluctant to defy his club's rules, but he eventually does destroy the pages for Bertie by the end of ''Much Obliged, Jeeves''.\n\nJeeves last appears in ''[[Aunts Aren't Gentlemen]]'', in which Jeeves and Bertie head to the rural village of Maiden Eggesford, though Jeeves wants to go to New York. He and Bertie visit New York at the end of the story.\n\n== Personal characteristics ==\n=== Age and appearance ===\n\nWhile Bertie Wooster is 24 years old in \"[[Jeeves Takes Charge]]\" (1916), Jeeves's age is not stated in the stories, and has been interpreted differently by various illustrators and adaptations. However, there are a few hints in the books regarding Jeeves's age. Jeeves has a long employment history, and he is older than Bertie Wooster.<ref>Wodehouse (1968) [1966], ''Plum Pie'', chapter 1, p. 46. Aunt Dahlia implies that Jeeves is \"maturer\" than Bertie.</ref> On the other hand, Jeeves is young enough to be engaged to a waitress courted by [[Bingo Little]], who is the same age as Bertie Wooster, in \"[[Jeeves in the Springtime]]\". In ''[[Ring for Jeeves]]'', Jeeves is described as resembling \"a youngish High Priest of a refined and dignified religion\".<ref>Wodeshouse (2008) [1953], ''Ring for Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 40.</ref>\n\nIn the reference work ''Wodehouse in Woostershire'' by Wodehouse scholars Geoffrey Jaggard and Tony Ring, it is speculated using information provided in the Jeeves canon that Bertie's age ranges from approximately 24 to 29 over the stories, and that Jeeves is roughly ten years older than Bertie, giving an age range of 35 to 40.<ref>Ring & Jaggard (1999), pp. 124\u2013126.</ref> This happens to agree with a personal letter written in 1961 by P. G. Wodehouse to scholar [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]], in which Wodehouse, explaining that his characters did not age with real life time, gave an approximate age for Jeeves:\n\n<blockquote>Keggs in ''[[A Damsel in Distress (novel)|A Damsel in Distress]]'' is supposed to be the same man who appears in ''[[Something Fishy|The Butler Did It]]'', but does it pan out all right? It doesn't if you go by when the books were written. The ''Damsel'' was published in 1919 and the ''Butler'' in 1957. But I always ignore real life time. After all, Jeeves\u2014first heard of at the age presumably of about thirty-five in 1916\u2014would now be around eighty-five, counting the real years.<ref>Hall (1974), pp. 16 and 19. Jeeves's first appearance was in \"Extricating Young Gussie\", which was published in 1915 the US. However, multiple Wodehouse reference books say that Jeeves first appeared in 1916, possibly because that is when he first appeared in both the US and the UK.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn appearance, Jeeves is described as \"tall and dark and impressive\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1953], ''Ring for Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 40.</ref> On multiple occasions, Bertie states that Jeeves has \"finely chiselled features\", and a large head, which seems to Bertie to indicate intelligence. As Bertie says, Jeeves is \"a godlike man in a bowler hat with grave, finely chiselled features and a head that stuck out at the back, indicating great brain power\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1949], ''The Mating Season'', chapter 23, pg. 219.</ref> Bertie also describes Jeeves's eyes as gleaming with intelligence.<ref name=garrison96 />\n\n=== Personality ===\n\nBertie frequently describes Jeeves as having a \"feudal spirit\". Jeeves aims to be helpful and will devote much time and effort to solving Bertie's personal problems despite not being obliged to do so. Demonstrating his loyalty to Bertie, Jeeves interrupts his vacation twice to come to Bertie's aid (in \"[[The Love That Purifies]]\" and ''[[Jeeves in the Offing]]''). He regularly rescues Bertie, usually from an unwanted marriage but also from other threats, such as when he saves Bertie from a hostile swan or when he pulls Bertie out of the way of a taxi.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 4, pp. 32\u201334.</ref> Proud of being a valet, Jeeves is evidently offended when a revolutionary tells him that servants are outdated in \"[[Comrade Bingo]]\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 12, p. 126.</ref>\n\nJeeves often shows sympathy for Bertie and others. He generally manipulates situations for the better and is described as \"a kindly man\" in ''Ring for Jeeves''.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1953], ''Ring for Jeeves'', chapter 19, p. 211.</ref>  However, he will influence Bertie's decisions to suit his own preferences, as when he causes Bertie to change his mind about living with his nieces in \"[[Bertie Changes His Mind]]\". Jeeves is also stubborn when opposing a new item that Bertie has taken a liking to, such as an alpine hat or purple socks. While he often stays on in spite of these radical objects, he can only withstand so much: the worst case is when he resigned after Bertie, privately labeling him as a \"domestic [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]\", resolved to study the banjolele in the countryside.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Thank You, Jeeves'', chapter 1.</ref> Usually, Jeeves finds a way to help Bertie with a problem, and Bertie agrees to give away the item that Jeeves disapproves of. Even when Bertie and Jeeves are having a disagreement, Jeeves still shows sympathy, as much as he shows any emotion, when Bertie is in serious trouble.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1963], ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 33. Bertie says regarding Jeeves, \"He and the young master may have had differences about Alpine hats with pink feathers in them, but when he sees the y.m. on the receiving end of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, he sinks his dudgeon and comes through with the feudal spirit at its best. So now, instead of being cold and distant and aloof, as a lesser man would have been, he showed the utmost agitation and concern. That is to say, he allowed one eyebrow to rise perhaps an eighth of an inch, which is as far as he ever goes in the way of expressing emotion.\"</ref>\n\nOften wearing \"an expression of quiet intelligence combined with a feudal desire to oblige\",<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Thank You, Jeeves'', chapter 5, p. 50.</ref> Jeeves consistently preserves the calm and courteous demeanor of a dutiful valet, and hardly displays any emotions. When he feels discomfort or is being discreet, he assumes an expressionless face which Bertie describes as resembling a \"stuffed moose\"<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 9, p. 94.</ref> or \"stuffed frog\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1954], ''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit'', chapter 12, p. 118 and chapter 21, p. 219.</ref> When very surprised, he will raise his eyebrow a small fraction of an inch, and when he is amused, the corner of his mouth twitches slightly.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1974], ''Aunts Aren't Gentlemen'', chapter 5, p. 46, and chapter 20, p. 182.</ref> His composure extends to his voice, which is soft and respectful.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 31.</ref> When he wishes to speak without having been spoken to or is about to discuss a delicate subject, he makes a low gentle cough \"like a very old sheep clearing its throat on a misty mountain top\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 11, p. 122.</ref> He may also cough to signify disapproval.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1963], ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves'', chapter 23, p. 191.</ref> Bertie states that he saw the normally imperturbable Jeeves come \"very near to being rattled\" for the first time when the sight of [[Bingo Little]] in a false beard caused Jeeves to drop his jaw and steady himself with a table in \"Comrade Bingo\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 12, p. 123&ndash;24.</ref> In ''[[Joy in the Morning (Wodehouse novel)|Joy in the Morning]]'', Bertie claims that the only occasion on which he had ever seen Jeeves \"really rattled\" was when he first met Bertie's friend Boko Fittleworth, who wears turtleneck sweaters and flannel trousers with a patch on the knee; Jeeves \"winced visibly and tottered off\" to recover his composure in the kitchen, where Bertie supposes Jeeves pulled himself together with cooking sherry.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1947], ''Joy in the Morning'', chapter 6, p. 52.</ref>\n\nBertie says that Jeeves is persuasive and magnetic. He notes that there is something about Jeeves that seems to soothe and hypnotize, making Jeeves effective at calming down an irate person.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 22, p. 269. Bertie describes Jeeves: \"He is magnetic. There is about him something that seems to soothe and hypnotize. To the best of my knowledge, he has never encountered a charging rhinoceros, but should this contingency occur, I have no doubt that the animal, meeting his eye, would check itself in mid-stride, roll over and lie purring with its legs in the air.\"</ref> He believes that Jeeves could convince a candidate standing for Parliament to vote against herself.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 8, p. 84.</ref> There is a poetic side to Jeeves, who recites a great deal of poetry. He is much affected when a parted couple reconciles, and tells Bertie that his heart leaps up when he beholds a rainbow in the sky.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1947], ''Joy in the Morning'', chapter 16, p. 154 and chapter 17, p. 161. Jeeves is probably quoting William Wordsworth's poem \"[[My Heart Leaps Up]]\".</ref>\n\nIt is not unusual for Bertie's acquaintances to ask for Jeeves's help directly without discussing it with Bertie, and Jeeves is willing to assist them even if Bertie is not involved in any way.<ref>Usborne (2003), p. 93.</ref> Bertie once says that Jeeves \"isn't so much a valet as a Mayfair consultant.\"<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1949], ''The Mating Season'', chapter 25, p. 245.</ref> On one occasion, Bertie considers it probable that even the distinguished Sir [[Roderick Glossop]] has consulted Jeeves, and says, \"Jeeves is like Sherlock Holmes. The highest in the land come to him with their problems. For all I know, they may give him jewelled snuff boxes.\"<ref>Wodehouse (1966), ''Plum Pie'', chapter 1, p. 15.</ref>\n\n=== Skills ===\nJeeves presents the ideal image of the gentlemanly manservant, being highly competent, dignified, and respectful. He speaks intelligently and correctly, using proper titles for members of the nobility. One of his skills is moving silently and unobtrusively from room to room. According to Bertie, Jeeves noiselessly \"floats\" and \"shimmers\";<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1938], ''The Code of the Woosters'', chapter 1, p. 1 and chapter 2, p. 28.</ref> Bertie once remarks, \"Presently I was aware that Jeeves was with me. I hadn't heard him come in, but you often don't with Jeeves. He just streams silently from spot A to spot B, like some gas\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1938], ''The Code of the Woosters'', chapter 6, p. 136.</ref> In addition to being a proficient valet, Jeeves can serve capably as a butler, and does so on a few occasions. As Bertie says in ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves'', \"If the call comes, he can buttle with the best of them.\"<ref name=cawthorne170>Cawthorne (2013), p. 170.</ref>\n\nIncredibly knowledgeable about topics ranging from horse racing to history, Jeeves has an encyclopedic knowledge of [[literature]] and [[Outline of academic disciplines|academic subjects]]. He frequently quotes from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and the [[Romanticism|romantic poets]]. Well informed about members of the British aristocracy thanks to the club book of the [[Junior Ganymede Club]], he also seems to have a considerable number of useful connections among various servants. Jeeves uses his knowledge and connections to solve problems inconspicuously.<ref>Cawthorne (2013), p. 173.</ref> [[Richard Usborne]], a leading scholar of the life and works of Wodehouse, describes Jeeves as a \"godlike prime mover\" and \"master brain who is found to have engineered the apparent coincidence or coincidences\".<ref>''Wodehouse at Work to the End'', Richard Usborne 1976.</ref> To form his plans, Jeeves often studies \"the psychology of the individual\" or the personality of one or more people involved in the situation.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1930], ''Very Good, Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 98. Jeeves says that studying \"the psychology of the individual\" is essential to solving problems, and that this means studying \"the natures and dispositions of the principals in the matter\".</ref> His mental prowess is attributed to eating fish, according to Bertie Wooster, who credits the phosphorus content in the fish with boosting Jeeves's brain power. Jeeves does not try to argue this claim, though at least once he says he does not eat a lot of fish,<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 5, p. 137.</ref> and in one conversation, Bertie states that he favours [[kippers]], while Jeeves prefers ham.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1949], ''The Mating Season'', chapter 8, p. 87.</ref>\n\nOne of Jeeves's greatest skills is making a special drink of his own invention, a strong beverage which momentarily stuns one's senses but is very effective in curing hangovers. Bertie first hires Jeeves after his hangover is cured by one of Jeeves's special drinks.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Not simply a hangover cure, the drink can also give energy to someone who needs it, yet calm down someone who is worked up.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1954], ''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit'', chapter 7, p. 65. \"It's a curious thing about those specials of Jeeves's, and one on which many revellers have commented, that while, as I mentioned earlier, they wake the sleeping tiger in you, they also work the other way round. I mean, if the tiger in you isn't sleeping but on the contrary up and doing with a heart for any fate, they lull you in. You come in like a lion, you take your snootful, and you got out like a lamb. Impossible to explain it, of course. One can merely state the facts.\"</ref> Dark in colour, Jeeves's special pick-me-up is composed of [[Worcester sauce]] (pronounced \"Wooster\" sauce), a raw egg, and red pepper according to Jeeves, though Bertie suspects that the drink consists of more than that.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 5, p. 48.</ref> Wodehouse mentions other ingredients in a personal letter he wrote late in his life, though the ingredients he stated in the letter are not referred to in the stories.<ref>Wodehouse (2011), ''P. G. Wodehouse: A Life in Letters'', p. 541. Wodehouse wrote: \"Jeeves's bracer does not contain dynamite as is generally supposed. It consists of lime juice, a lump of sugar, and one teaspoonful of [[Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo|Mulliner's ''Buck-U-Uppo'']]. This, it will be remembered, is the amount of the Buck-U-Uppo given to elephants in India to enable them to face tigers on tiger hunts with the necessary nonchalance.\"</ref> Additionally, Jeeves is capable of typing and writing [[shorthand]].<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 10, and chapter 16, p. 183.</ref>\n\nJeeves has knowledge in more dubious subjects as well. He is well-informed about how to steal paintings and kidnap dogs.<ref>Wodehouse (1993) [1959], ''A Few Quick Ones'', chapter 4, p. 79. Jeeves tells Bertie how to steal a painting with treacle and brown paper, and says that this is \"the recognized method in vogue in the burgling industry\".</ref><ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1930], ''Very Good, Jeeves'', chapter 5, pp. 125\u2013126. Jeeves tells Bertie how to lure a dog using aniseed, and says that it is extensively used in the dog-stealing industry.</ref> He uses a [[Mickey Finn (drugs)|Mickey Finn]] to incapacitate the unscrupulous [[List of Jeeves characters#Rupert Bingley|Bingley]].<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 11, p. 123.</ref> Capable of violence when the situation calls for it, Jeeves uses a golf club to knock out Sippy Sipperley in \"[[The Inferiority Complex of Old Sippy]]\", and takes down a swan with a raincoat and boathook in \"[[Jeeves and the Impending Doom]]\". He finds it necessary to get Aunt Dahlia to knock out Bertie with a gong stick in \"[[Jeeves Makes an Omelette]]\", though he agrees with Bertie not to use this sort of tactic again.<ref>Wodehouse (1993) [1959], ''A Few Quick Ones'', chapter 4, p. 89.</ref><ref>Thompson (1992), p. 131. \"Certainly Jeeves never uses violence against Bertie, though he does\u2014regretfully\u2014get Aunt Dahlia to knock him out as part of the solution in 'Jeeves Makes an Omelet'.\"</ref> After Jeeves uses a cosh to knock out Constable Dobbs in ''[[The Mating Season (novel)|The Mating Season]]'', an astonished Bertie describes Jeeves as \"something that would be gratefully accepted as a muscle guy by any gang on the lookout for new blood\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1949], ''The Mating Season'', chapter 24, p. 235.</ref>\n\n=== Hobbies ===\n\nJeeves often reads intellectual, \"improving\" books, including the works of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Shakespeare]], and \"[[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]] and the great Russians\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged, Jeeves'', chapter 7, p. 72. Bertie says, \"'You want me to recommend you a good book? Well, of course, it depends on what you like. Jeeves, for instance, is never happier than when curled up with his Spinoza or his Shakespeare.'\"</ref><ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1954], ''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit'', chapter 1, p. 11. \"'My personal tastes lie more in the direction of Dostoevsky and the great Russians.'\"</ref> He also enjoys the works of romance novelist [[Rosie M. Banks]],<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 19.</ref> and regularly reads ''[[The Times]]'', which Bertie occasionally borrows to try the crossword puzzle.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1960], ''Jeeves in the Offing'', chapter 2, p. 25.</ref> In \"[[Jeeves in the Springtime]]\", he went dancing in Camberwell, where he was seen by Bertie's friend Bingo Little. Bingo says that he saw Jeeves \"swinging a dashed efficient shoe\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 15.</ref> Once a week, Jeeves takes the afternoon off to play [[contract bridge|bridge]] at his club, the Junior Ganymede.<ref>Wodehouse (1968) [1966], ''Plum Pie'', chapter 1, p. 32.</ref>\n\nOne of Jeeves's hobbies is fishing, which he tends to do during his annual summer holiday. Bertie sees him fishing in ''[[Joy in the Morning (Wodehouse novel)|Joy in the Morning]]''.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1947], ''Joy in the Morning'', chapter 20, p. 184.</ref> Appreciating travel in general, Jeeves wants to go on a cruise in two different stories, \"[[The Spot of Art]]\" and ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. Jeeves claims that travel is educational, though Bertie suspects that Jeeves has a Viking strain and \"yearns for the tang of the salt breezes\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1938], ''The Code of the Woosters'', chapter 1, p. 9.</ref> Jeeves occasionally enjoys gambling, which is the reason he wishes to go to Monte Carlo in \"[[Jeeves and the Yule-tide Spirit]]\".\n\n== Relationship with Bertie Wooster ==\nThe premise of the Jeeves stories is that the brilliant [[valet]] is firmly in control of his rich and unworldly young employer's life. Jeeves becomes Bertie Wooster's guardian and all-purpose problem solver, devising subtle plans to help Bertie and his friends with various problems. In particular, Jeeves extricates Bertie Wooster from engagements to formidable women whom Bertie reluctantly becomes engaged to, Bertie being unwilling to hurt a woman's feelings by turning her down. While Jeeves wants to keep Bertie from a fianc\u00e9e whom he believes will not make Bertie happy, Jeeves also wants to keep his position, which he feels would be threatened by a wife.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 36. In \"Jeeves Takes Charge\", Bertie fires Jeeves after Jeeves causes Florence to end her engagement to Bertie. Jeeves explains his actions: \"'As I am no longer in your employment, sir, I can speak freely without appearing to take a liberty. In my opinion you and Lady Florence were quite unsuitably matched... You would not have been happy, sir!'\"</ref><ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 10, p. 256. Upset that Bertie appears to be contemplating marriage, Jeeves states that, in his experience, \"when the wife comes in at the front door the valet of bachelor days goes out at the back\".</ref> Jeeves also provides assistance when Bertie, who refuses to let a pal down, gets drawn into trouble trying to help a friend or a relative he is fond of. Bertie is usually unaware of the extent of Jeeves's machinations until all is revealed at the end of the story. On one occasion, Bertie acknowledges and accepts his role as a pawn in Jeeves's grand plan, though Jeeves objects, saying that he could have accomplished nothing without Bertie's cooperation.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Thank You, Jeeves'', chapter 22, pp. 259\u2013260.</ref>\n\nFor the most part, Bertie and Jeeves are on good terms. Being fond of Bertie, Jeeves considers their connection \"pleasant in every respect\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 10, pp. 256 and 266.</ref> Bertie says that he looks on Jeeves as \"a sort of guide, philosopher, and friend\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 10. This is a reference to a poem by Alexander Pope.</ref> At times when Bertie is separated from Jeeves, Bertie is miserable. When Bertie must stay by himself in a hotel in \"[[The Aunt and the Sluggard]]\", he struggles without having Jeeves there to press his clothes and bring him tea, saying \"I don't know when I've felt so rotten. Somehow I found myself moving about the room softly, as if there had been a death in the family\"; he later cheers himself up by going round the cabarets, though \"the frightful loss of Jeeves made any thought of pleasure more or less a mockery\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 5, pp. 125\u2013126 and 130.</ref> In ''[[Thank You, Jeeves]]'', when Jeeves has left Bertie's employment because of their disagreement over a banjolele, Bertie still seeks Jeeves for help and Jeeves comes to his aid.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Thank You, Jeeves'', chapter 15, p. 173.</ref> Bertie dislikes when Jeeves goes on his annual holiday, stating, \"without this right-hand man at his side Bertram Wooster becomes a mere shadow his former self\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1954], ''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit'', chapter 1, p. 8.</ref> Jeeves appreciates the praise that Bertie bestows on him, saying that \"Mr. Wooster has always been gratifyingly appreciative of my humble efforts on his behalf\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1953], ''Ring for Jeeves'', chapter 5, p. 61.</ref>\n\nJeeves has firm ideas about how an English gentleman should dress and behave, and sees it as his duty to ensure that his employer presents himself appropriately. When friction arises between Jeeves and Bertie, it is usually over some new item about which Bertie Wooster is enthusiastic that does not meet with Jeeves's approval, such as bright purple socks, a white mess jacket, or a garish vase. Bertie becomes attached to these less conservative pieces and views Jeeves's opposition to them as \"hidebound and reactionary\",<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 1, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> marking him \"an enemy to Progress\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 16, p. 210.</ref> This type of disagreement results in a period of coolness between them. The conflict is resolved by the end of the story, typically after Jeeves has helped Bertie with his latest problem. Bertie, grateful, agrees to have it Jeeves's way. He does not object if he learns that Jeeves, foreseeing that Bertie would agree to give up the item, has already disposed of it.\n\nBertie considers Jeeves to be a marvel, and wonders why Jeeves is content to work for him, stating, \"It beats me sometimes why a man with his genius is satisfied to hang around pressing my clothes and what not\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 2, p. 45.</ref> Jeeves has been offered twice the salary Bertie pays him by another gentleman, but still remains with Bertie.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1925], ''Carry On, Jeeves'', chapter 4, p. 84.</ref> Jeeves views Bertie as being friendly but mentally negligible, though his opinion of Bertie's intelligence seems to improve over time. In an early story, he says that Bertie is \"an exceedingly pleasant and amiable young gentleman, but not intelligent. By no means intelligent. Mentally he is negligible \u2013 quite negligible.\"<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1923], ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', chapter 5, p. 55.</ref> Hearing this spurs Bertie to try to solve problems on his own, though he ultimately fails and needs Jeeves's assistance. Nonetheless, Jeeves's view of Bertie's intelligence has apparently softened by the first novel, when Jeeves says that Bertie \"is, perhaps, mentally somewhat negligible, but he has a heart of gold\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Thank You, Jeeves'', chapter 7, p. 82.</ref> At one point in the ninth novel, Jeeves actually commends Bertie's quick thinking, saying that Bertie's tactic of hiding from an antagonist behind a sofa \"showed a resource and swiftness of thought which it would be difficult to overpraise\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1963], ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves'', chapter 21, p. 178.</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nIn the twenty-first century, a \"[[wikt:Jeeves|Jeeves]]\" is a generic term for any useful and reliable person, found in dictionaries such as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''<ref>{{cite web\n | author      = Ring, Tony\n | date        = c. 2000 <!--NO DATE GIVEN, ARTICLE CITES SOME \"1999\" BOOKS-->\n | title       = Jeeves and Wooster March Into The Twenty-first Century\n | work        = Wodehouse.ru <!-- NOT SOURCE GIVEN BY WODEHOUSE.RU -->\n | url         = http://wodehouse.ru/march.htm\n | accessdate  = 2007-08-15\n | quote       = The frequency with which the term 'Jeeves' is used without further explanation in the media of today, and its inclusion as a generic term in the Oxford English Dictionary, suggests that P G Wodehouse's Jeeves, together with his principal employer Bertie Wooster, remain the most popular of his many enduring characters.\n}}</ref> or the ''[[Encarta Webster's Dictionary|Encarta World English Dictionary]]''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |author=Encarta World English Dictionary\n |date=2007\n |title=Jeeves\n |work=Encarta.msn.com\n |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/Jeeves.html\n |accessdate=2007-08-15\n |quote=Jeeves [ jeevz ], noun \u2013 Definition: resourceful helper: a useful and reliable person who provides ready solutions to problems ( informal ) [Mid-20th century. < a character in the novels of P.

With minor exceptions, the short stories were written and published first (between 1915 and 1930); the novels later (between 1934 and 1974). While the series of stories featuring the character of Jeeves are often referred to as the \"Jeeves\" stories, the series is also called by other names such as the \"Jeeves and Wooster\" or \"Jeeves and Bertie\" stories.\n\nBertie Wooster narrates (in the [[First-person narrative|first person]]) all the stories but two, \"[[Bertie Changes His Mind]]\" (which Jeeves himself narrates in the [[First-person narrative|first person]]), and ''[[Ring for Jeeves]]'' (which features Jeeves but not Bertie Wooster and is written in the [[Third-person narrative#Third-person|third person]]).\n\nJeeves and Bertie first appeared in \"[[Extricating Young Gussie]]\", a short story published in the US in September 1915, though it was not seen in the UK until 1916. In the story, Jeeves's character is minor and not fully developed, and Bertie's surname appears to be Mannering-Phipps. The first fully recognisable Jeeves and Wooster story was \"Leave It to Jeeves\", published in early 1916.  As the series progressed, Jeeves assumed the role of Bertie Wooster's co-protagonist. Most of the Jeeves stories were originally published as magazine pieces before being collected into books, although 11 of the short stories were reworked and divided into 18 chapters to make an episodic semi-novel called ''The Inimitable Jeeves''.  Other collections, most notably ''The World of Jeeves'', restore these to their original form of 11 distinct stories.\n\n* ''[[The Man with Two Left Feet]]'' (1917) \u2013 One story in a book of thirteen\n** \"[[Extricating Young Gussie]]\" \u2013 The first appearances of Jeeves and Bertie, originally published 1915-9-18 in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wodehouse.ru/bibssty.htm |title= Bibliography of short stories |author= The Russian Wodehouse Society  |access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref>\n* ''[[My Man Jeeves]]'' (1919) \u2013 Four stories in a book of eight, all four reprinted in the 1925 collection ''Carry On, Jeeves''.

''The Cat-nappers'')\n\nThe collection ''The World of Jeeves'' (first published in 1967, reprinted in 1988) contains all of the Jeeves short stories (with the exception of \"Extricating Young Gussie\") presented more or less in narrative chronological order, but with some variations from the originals.\n\nAn efficient method of reading the entire Jeeves canon is to read ''The World of Jeeves'', followed by the eleven novels in order of publication. The novels generally mention characters and events that happened in previous stories. Another way of reading most of the Jeeves canon is to read the short story collections ''The Inimitable Jeeves'', ''Carry On, Jeeves'', and ''Very Good, Jeeves'', followed by the novels. While ''Carry On, Jeeves'' features some earlier stories, it also includes stories that occur after events in ''The Inimitable Jeeves''.\n\nTwo \"pastiche\" Jeeves and Wooster novels have been authorized by the Wodehouse estate:  ''Jeeves and the Wedding Bells'' (2013) by [[Sebastian Faulks]] and ''Jeeves and the King of Clubs'' (2018) by [[Ben Schott]].\n\n===Setting and timeline===\n\nThe short stories are set primarily in London, where Bertie Wooster has a flat and is a member of the raucous [[Drones Club]], or in [[New York City]], though some short stories are set around various stately homes in the English countryside. The novels all take place at or near an English country house, most commonly [[Brinkley Court]] (in four novels) and [[Totleigh Towers]] (in two novels).\n\nThe Jeeves stories are described as occurring within a few years of each other. For example, Bertie states in ''[[Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit]]'' (1954) that his Aunt Dahlia has been running her paper ''Milady's Boudoir'', first introduced in \"[[Clustering Round Young Bingo]]\" (1925), for about three years.<ref>''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit'', chapter 5, p. 45.</ref> However, there are inconsistencies between the stories that make it difficult to construct a timeline. For instance, it is stated in ''[[Jeeves in the Offing]]'' that Aunt Dahlia ran her paper for four years, and not three, as is shown in ''Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit''. Nonetheless, some scholars have attempted to create a rough timeline. [[J. H. C. Morris]] suggested that the Jeeves canon spanned approximately five years, stating that four Christmases are accounted for, and another must have passed during Bertie's time in America in the early stories, making five in all.<ref>Morris (1981), p. 4.</ref> Writer [[Kristin Thompson]] also suggested that approximately five years passed during the stories, though Thompson instead relied on explicit references to time passed between events in the series.<ref>Thompson (1992), pp. 340\u2013341.</ref>\n\nThe stories follow a [[floating timeline]], with each story being set at the time it was written, while the characters do not change and past events are referred to as happening recently. This results in the stories following \"two kinds of time\", as the characters hardly age but are seen against the background of a changing world.<ref>French (1966), p. 95.</ref> This floating timeline allows for comedic references to films, songs, and politicians that would have been well known to readers when the stories were written.

In contrast to the 1930s films featuring Arthur Treacher, the scripts for this series by [[Clive Exton]] have been praised for their fidelity to Wodehouse's original vision although there are some departures. Notably, in the episode \"[[The Delayed Arrival]]\", Jeeves wears women's clothing and makeup in order to impersonate the novelist [[List of Jeeves characters#Daphne Dolores Morehead|Daphne Dolores Morehead]], which he does not do in the story on which the episode was based, ''[[Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit]]''. Also, the series uses Hugh Laurie's ability to sing and play [[boogie woogie]] piano by having Bertie perform such songs accompanied by Jeeves, something that does not occur in the stories.\n\n=== Film ===\n* In 1919, two silent short comedy films, \"Making Good with Mother\" and \"Cutting Out Venus\", were released in the US. These shorts were inspired by the [[Reggie Pepper]] stories and directed by [[Lawrence C. Windom]]. Reggie Pepper, a prototype for Bertie Wooster, was given a manservant named \"Jeeves\" who was a reformed burglar. The shorts featured [[Lawrence Grossmith]] as Reggie Pepper and [[Charles Coleman (actor)|Charles Coleman]] as Jeeves.<ref>Taves (2006), pp. 16 and 150.</ref>\n* ''[[Thank You, Jeeves!]]'' (1936) was the first film to feature Jeeves and Bertie, with [[Arthur Treacher]] as Jeeves and [[David Niven]] as Bertie Wooster. In the film, they meet a girl and help her brother stop two spies trying to get his secret plans. The film has almost nothing to do with the book of that title.  Treacher was associated with butler and manservant roles, having played such parts in several previous films, including the [[Shirley Temple]] film ''Curly Top'' (1935). In this case, however, the script called on him to play the character as unhelpful, pompous and rather unpleasant, with none of the trademark brilliance of the literary Jeeves.\n* ''[[Step Lively, Jeeves!]]'' (1937) also featured [[Arthur Treacher]] as Jeeves. Two swindlers con Jeeves into claiming he has a fortune waiting for him in America, where Jeeves meets some gangsters. Bertie Wooster does not appear, Jeeves is portrayed as a naive bumbler, and the film has nothing to do with any Wodehouse story. Wodehouse was disappointed with the two Treacher films.<ref>Taves (2006), pp. 74\u201381.</ref>\n* ''[[By Jeeves]]'' (2001) was a recorded performance of the musical, released as a video (with British actor [[Martin Jarvis (actor)|Martin Jarvis]] as Jeeves and American actor John Scherer as Bertie Wooster). It also aired on television.\n\n=== Radio ===\n* \"Leave It To Jeeves\" (1940) was an episode of the American [[CBS]] radio series ''Forecast''. Despite its title, the episode was not based on the Wodehouse short story originally titled \"[[The Artistic Career of Corky|Leave it to Jeeves]]\". It featured an original story set in New York. In the radio drama, Bertie tries to help his friend [[Bingo Little]] end his engagement to a woman named Gloria, and inadvertently gets engaged to Gloria himself, while Jeeves dislikes Bertie's new yellow spats. Jeeves rescues Bertie from his engagement, and a grateful Bertie allows Jeeves to dispose of the spats. [[Alan Mowbray]] portrayed Jeeves and [[Edward Everett Horton]] portrayed Bertie Wooster. The scriptwriter was [[Stuart Palmer]].<ref>Taves (2006), p. 98.</ref>\n* In the 1955 [[BBC Light Programme]] dramatisation of the novel ''[[Ring for Jeeves]]'', [[Deryck Guyler]] portrayed Jeeves and [[Ian Carmichael]] portrayed [[List of Jeeves characters#Bill Belfry, 9th Earl of Rowcester|Bill, Lord Rowcester]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/290297ec6a2c453e809be9f70396650e |title=Radio Theatre: Ring for Jeeves |issue=1631 |pages=11 |journal= The Radio Times|publisher=BBC|date= 11 February 1955|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref> In the following 1956 dramatisation of ''[[Right Ho, Jeeves]]'', Deryck Guyler again portrayed Jeeves, and [[Naunton Wayne]] portrayed Bertie Wooster.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/d672536b7b10492e935323ff138405e9|title=Three Star Bill Drama: Naunton Wayne with Deryck Guyler and Richard Wattis in ' Right Ho, Jeeves' |issue=1699 |pages=13 |journal= The Radio Times|publisher=BBC|date= June 1956|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n* ''Jeeves'' was a 1958 LP record issued by [[Caedmon Audio|Caedmon]] with [[Terry-Thomas]] as Bertie Wooster and [[Roger Livesey]] as Jeeves.

She was born in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]. Gottlieb's professional career spans more than 50 years. She practiced architecture in and outside the U.S. as a prolific residential designer. Most of her domestic designs can be found in California, Washington, Idaho and Virginia. Gottlieb's works have been featured in various publications, exhibits, and the documentary video made about her work on 'The Gottlieb House' in Fairfax Station, Virginia. Lois Davidson was an apprentice to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a part of the [[Taliesin West|Taliesin Fellowship in Scottsdale, Arizona,]] and Wright's winter home and the western counterpart to [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin East]] in Spring Green, Wisconsin, 1948\u20131949. Gottlieb is also a former member of [[International Archive of Women in Architecture]] Board of Directors. She passed away on August 21, 2018 at age 91.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Education ==\nGottlieb attended [[Stanford University]], where she studied pre-architecture, a combination of art and engineering before earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from1944 to 1947.\n\nIn the last quarter of her senior year, Gottlieb was about to graduate from Stanford University and did not know what to do with herself. she visited Frank Lloyd Wright's [[Hanna\u2013Honeycomb House|Hanna-Honeycomb House]] (1936) near the university campus for one of the classes she took. As she would later recall, \"I was stunned and enchanted. lt was as though l had never heard music before and here was confronted with the visual equivalent of a Beethoven symphony.\" Driven by the appreciation for, and a desire to learn more about the design philosophy of Wright's architecture, Gottlieb applied and later accepted as an apprentice to the Taliesin Fellowship. She began a two-year journey of work and study with Wright in 1948; she was to discover that architecture could be \"a way of life\". Gottlieb was one of the few women who have been apprenticed to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a Taliesin fellow. During her time at Taliesin, she worked on the [[The Acres|Eric and Pat Pratt Residence]], aka the Pratt house in Michigan, and the Walker house in Carmel, California.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Gottlieb, Lois Davidson.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47063813|title=A way of life : an apprenticeship with Frank Lloyd Wright|date=2001|publisher=Images Pub.

She went on to design other residences in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] as part of the design team Duncombe-Davidson based in [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]]. This partnership spanned the years 1951 to 1956.

It has been used as an intensive since at least the 1670s.<ref>Sterfania Biscetti, \"The diachronic development of ''bloody'': a case study in historical pragmatics\". In Richard Dury, Maurizio Gotti, Marina Dossena (eds.) ''English Historical Linguistics 2006 Volume 2: Lexical and semantic change''. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company. 2008, p. 55.</ref> Considered respectable until about 1750, it was heavily tabooed during c. 1750&ndash;1920, considered equivalent to heavily obscene or profane speech.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Public use continued to be seen as controversial until the 1960s, but since the later 20th century, the word has become a comparatively mild expletive or intensifier. In [[American English]], the word is used almost exclusively in its literal sense and is seen by American audiences as a stereotypical marker of British English, without any significant obscene or profane connotation.\n\n==Origin==\nOrigin, as many English oaths and profanities, came from the post English civil war era during the Puritan era where many profanities if uttered  would incite severe punishments such as the scolds bridle. The origin of the word is a compression of the saying \"By Our Lady\" referring to the Holy mother when making an oath, which eventually became \"B Lady\" then to \"Bloody\" The use of this profanity appears before the Dutch influence of William but about the times of the English Dutch wars which led to Charles I and the Parliament going to war over raising taxes to fight the Dutch. In Northern England who were less favourable of the parliamentarian government the inflex of the dialects would say \"Bi Or Lady\" which is easily compressed to \"B L oody\" when used in a Yorkshire or Northumbrian accent the origin is easier to understand.\n\nUse of the adjective ''bloody'' as a profane intensifier predates the 18th century. Its ultimate origin is unclear, and several hypotheses have been suggested. It may be a direct loan of Dutch ''bloote'', meaning ''entire'', ''complete'' or ''pure, which was suggested by Ker (1837) to have been \"transformed into ''bloody'', in the consequently absurd phrases of ''bloody good'', ''bloody bad'', ''bloody thief'', ''bloody angry'', etc., where it simply implies completely, entirely, purely, very, truly, and has no relation to either blood or murder, except by corruption of the word.\"<ref>John Bellenden Ker, An Essay on the Arch\u00e6ology of our Popular Phrases and Nursery Rhymes, London:Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green & Co., 1837, pg 36.</ref>\n\nThe word \"blood\" in Dutch and German is used as part of [[minced oath]]s, in abbreviation of expressions referring to \"God's blood\", i.e. [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]] or the [[Eucharist]]. [[Ernest Weekley]] (1921) relates English usage to imitation of purely intensive use of Dutch ''bloed'' and German ''Blut'' in the early modern period.\n\nA popularly reported theory suggested euphemistic derivation from the phrase  ''by Our Lady''. The contracted form ''by'r Lady'' is common in [[Shakespeare]]'s plays around the turn of the 17th century, and [[Jonathan Swift]] about 100 years later writes both \"it grows by'r Lady cold\" and \"it was bloody hot walking to-day\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Works_of_the_Rev._Jonathan_Swift/Volume_15/Journal_to_Stella_%E2%80%93_Letter_24 |title=The Journal to Stella, by Jonathan Swift : Letter 24 |publisher=Etext.library.adelaide.edu.au |date=1711 }}</ref> suggesting that ''bloody'' and ''by'r Lady''  had become exchangeable generic intensifiers.\nHowever, [[Eric Partridge]] (1933) describes the supposed derivation of ''bloody'' as a further contraction of ''by'r lady'' as \"phonetically implausible\". \n<!--\nThe immediately following text was apparently removed  from the  rendered content of the article but preserved for the attention of editors:\n{{\n[[Geoffrey Hughes]] in ''Swearing: A social history of foul langyuage, oaths and profanity in English'' ([[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]], 1991), points out that \"by my lady\" is not an adjective whereas ''bloody'' is, and suggests that the slang use of the term started with ''bloody drunk'' meaning \"fired up and ready for a fight\".\n}}\nIn contrast, *this* immediately following text seems to be a comment by an editor who removed the previous brace-enclosed material from the rendered portion of the article text:\n{{\nnot sure what this is supposed to add other than that this author in 1991(!) was not even aware of the adverbial use of ''by'r lady'' just cited\n}}\n\nIf i remember to, i'll copy this inside-a-comment discussion (begun here, in an abuse of the comment-markup facility by an as yet unidentified colleaague, and continued here by my own somewhat milder abuse) to where it belongs, on the accompanying talk page, using a better interface, and with detailed info on the edit history of this comment.\n-- User Jerzy, 2018 Jan 3, 9-PM-ish, (US)EDT\n \n-->\nAccording to ''Rawson's dictionary of Euphemisms'' (1995), attempts to derive ''bloody'' from minced oaths for \"by our lady\" or \"God's blood\" are based on the attempt to explain the word's extraordinary shock power in the 18th to 19th centuries, but they disregard that the earliest records of the word as an intensifier in the 17th to early 18th century do not reflect any taboo or profanity. It seems more likely, according to Rawson, that the taboo against the word arose secondarily, perhaps because of an association with [[menstruation]].<ref>\"More likely, the taboo stemmed from the fear that many people have of blood and, in the minds of some, from an association with menstrual bleeding. Whatever, the term was debarred from polite society during the whole of the nineteenth century.\" Rawson (1995).</ref>\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary prefers the theory that it arose from aristocratic rowdies known as \"bloods\", hence \"bloody drunk\" means \"drunk as a blood\".<ref>https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bloody</ref>\n\n==History of use==\nUntil at least the early 18th century, the word was used innocuously. It was used as an intensifier without apparent implication of profanity by 18th-century authors such as [[Henry Fielding]] and [[Jonathan Swift]] (\"It was bloody hot walking today\" in 1713) and [[Samuel Richardson]] (\"He is bloody passionate\" in 1742).\n\nAfter about 1750 the word assumed more [[profanity|profane]] connotations. [[A Dictionary of the English Language|Johnson (1755)]] already calls it \"very vulgar\", and the original [[Oxford English Dictionary]] article of 1888 comments the word is \"now constantly in the mouths of the lowest classes, but by respectable people considered 'a horrid word', on par with obscene or profane language\".\n\nOn the opening night of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s comedy ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' in 1914, [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]], in the role of Eliza Doolittle, created a sensation with the line \"Walk! Not bloody likely!\" and this led to a fad for using \"Pygmalion\" itself as a pseudo-oath, as in \"Not Pygmalion likely\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/apps26/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=106299&section=filmfact |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207103513/http://www.channel4.com/apps26/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=106299&section=filmfact |archive-date=7 February 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/topicalwords/tw-blo1.htm |title=Bloody |publisher=World Wide Words |date=2006-04-01 |accessdate=2013-05-24}}</ref> and ''bloody'' was referred to as \"the Shavian adjective\" in polite society.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe character Geoffrey Fisher in [[Keith Waterhouse]]'s play ''[[Billy Liar]]'' (1959) is notable for his continual use of the word \"bloody\". Waterhouse's stage directions make it clear that if this is considered offensive the word should be omitted entirely and not [[bowdlerisation|bowdlerised]] to ''ruddy'' or some other word.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe use of \"bloody\" in adult UK broadcasting aroused controversy in the 1960s and 1970s, but it has since become a mild expletive and is used more freely.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Usage outside the UK==\n''Bloody'' has always been a very common part of [[Australian English|Australian speech]] and has not been considered profane there for some time. The word was dubbed \"the Australian adjective\" by ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'' on 18 August 1894. One Australian performer, [[Kevin Bloody Wilson]], has even made it his middle name. Also in Australia, the word ''bloody'' is frequently used as a verbal hyphen,  or infix, correctly called [[tmesis]] as in \"fanbloodytastic\". In the 1940s an Australian divorce court judge held that \"the word ''bloody'' is so common in modern parlance that it is not regarded as swearing\".  Meanwhile, [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s government was fining Britons for using the word in public.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe word as an expletive is seldom used in the [[United States|United States of America]]. In the US the term is usually used when the intention is to mimic an Englishman. Because it is not perceived as profane in [[American English]], \"bloody\" is not censored when used in American television and film, for example in the 1961 film ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' the actor [[Richard Harris]] at one point says: \"You can't even see the bloody cave, let alone the bloody guns. And anyway, we haven't got a bloody bomb big enough to smash that bloody rock&nbsp;...\"&nbsp;\u2013 but ''bloody'' was replaced with ''ruddy'' for British audiences of the time.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe term is used somewhat frequently in Canada,{{cn|date=June 2019}} especially in the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Newfoundland]].{{cn|date=June 2019}} Younger Canadians generally do not consider the term to be offensive; however, older Canadians of British origin might.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn [[Singapore]], the word ''bloody'' is commonly used as a mild expletive in [[Singlish|Singapore's colloquial English]]. The roots of this expletive derives from the influence and informal language British officers used during the dealing and training of soldiers in the [[Singapore Volunteer Corps]] and the early days of the [[Singapore Armed Forces]]. When more Singaporeans were promoted officers within the Armed Forces, most new local officers applied similar training methods their former British officers had when they were cadets or trainees themselves. This includes some aspects of British Army lingo, like \"bloody (something)\". When the newly elected Singapore government implemented compulsory conscription, all 18 year old able bodied Singapore males had to undergo training within the Armed Forces. When National servicemen completed their service term, some brought the many expletives they picked up during their service into the civilian world and thus became a part of the common culture in the city state. The word \"bloody\" also managed to spread to the north in neighbouring Malaysia, to where the influence of Singapore English has spread. The use of \"bloody\" as a substitute for more explicit language increased with the popularity of British and Australian films and television shows aired on local television programmes. The term ''bloody'' in Singapore may not be considered explicit, but its usage is frowned upon in formal settings.\n\nThe term is frequently used among [[South Africa]]ns in their colloquial English and it is an [[intensifier]]. It is used in both [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] and non-explicit ways. It also spread to [[Afrikaans]] as \"bloedige\" and is popular amongst all citizens in the country. It is also used by [[Minor (law)|minors]] and is not considered to be offensive.\n\n==Euphemisms==\nMany substitutions were devised{{year needed|date=November 2015}} to convey the essence of the oath, but with less offence; these included ''bleeding'', ''bleaking'', ''cruddy'', ''smuddy'', ''blinking'', ''blooming'', ''bally'', ''woundy'', '' flaming'' and ''ruddy''.\n\nPublications such as newspapers, police reports, and so on may{{year needed|date=November 2015}} print ''b__y'' instead of the full profanity.<ref name=\"OED\">{{Citation|title=Oxford English Dictionary.}}</ref> \nA spoken language equivalent is ''blankety'' or, less frequently, ''blanked'' or ''blanky''; the spoken words are all variations of ''blank'', which, as a verbal representation of a [[dash]], is used as a [[euphemism]] for a variety of \"bad\" words.<ref name=\"OED\"/>\n\n==In composition==\nUse of ''bloody'' as an adverbial or generic intensifier is to be distinguished from its fixed use in the expressions \"bloody murder\" and \"bloody hell\". In \"bloody murder\", it has the original sense of an adjective used literally. The [[King James Version]] of the Bible frequently uses ''bloody'' as an adjective in reference to bloodshed or violent crime, as in \"bloody crimes\" (Ezekiel 22:2), \"Woe to the bloody city\" (Ezekiel 24:6, Nahum 3:1). \"bloody men\" (26:9, Psalms 59:2, 139:19), etc. The expression of \"bloody murder\" goes back to at least Elizabethan English, as in Shakespeare's ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' (c. 1591), \"bloody murder or detested rape\".\nThe expression \"scream bloody murder\" (in the figurative or desemanticised sense of \"to loudly object to something\" attested since c. 1860)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/idioms/scream+bloody+murder |title=Idioms Dictionary &#124; Common Idioms and Phrases in English Language &#124; Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-24}}</ref> is now considered American English, while in British English, the euphemistic \"blue murder\" had replaced \"bloody murder\" during the period of \"bloody\" being considered taboo.<ref>[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-blu4.htm worldwidewords.org]</ref>\n\nThe expression \"bloody [[hell]]\" is now  used as a general expression of surprise or as a general intensifier; e.g. \"bloody hell\" being used repeatedly in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (2001, [[PG Rating]]). In March 2006 [[Australia]]'s national tourism commission launched an [[advertising campaign]] targeted at potential visitors in several English-speaking countries.  The ad sparked controversy because of its ending (in which a cheerful, bikini-clad spokeswoman delivers the ad's call-to-action by saying \"...[[so where the bloody hell are you?]]\").

Waterhouse's stage directions make it clear that if this is considered offensive the word should be omitted entirely and not [[bowdlerisation|bowdlerised]] to ''ruddy'' or some other word.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe use of \"bloody\" in adult UK broadcasting aroused controversy in the 1960s and 1970s, but it has since become a mild expletive and is used more freely.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Usage outside the UK==\n''Bloody'' has always been a very common part of [[Australian English|Australian speech]] and has not been considered profane there for some time. The word was dubbed \"the Australian adjective\" by ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'' on 18 August 1894. One Australian performer, [[Kevin Bloody Wilson]], has even made it his middle name. Also in Australia, the word ''bloody'' is frequently used as a verbal hyphen,  or infix, correctly called [[tmesis]] as in \"fanbloodytastic\". In the 1940s an Australian divorce court judge held that \"the word ''bloody'' is so common in modern parlance that it is not regarded as swearing\".  Meanwhile, [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s government was fining Britons for using the word in public.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe word as an expletive is seldom used in the [[United States|United States of America]]. In the US the term is usually used when the intention is to mimic an Englishman. Because it is not perceived as profane in [[American English]], \"bloody\" is not censored when used in American television and film, for example in the 1961 film ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' the actor [[Richard Harris]] at one point says: \"You can't even see the bloody cave, let alone the bloody guns. And anyway, we haven't got a bloody bomb big enough to smash that bloody rock&nbsp;...\"&nbsp;\u2013 but ''bloody'' was replaced with ''ruddy'' for British audiences of the time.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe term is used somewhat frequently in Canada,{{cn|date=June 2019}} especially in the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Newfoundland]].{{cn|date=June 2019}} Younger Canadians generally do not consider the term to be offensive; however, older Canadians of British origin might.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn [[Singapore]], the word ''bloody'' is commonly used as a mild expletive in [[Singlish|Singapore's colloquial English]]. The roots of this expletive derives from the influence and informal language British officers used during the dealing and training of soldiers in the [[Singapore Volunteer Corps]] and the early days of the [[Singapore Armed Forces]]. When more Singaporeans were promoted officers within the Armed Forces, most new local officers applied similar training methods their former British officers had when they were cadets or trainees themselves. This includes some aspects of British Army lingo, like \"bloody (something)\". When the newly elected Singapore government implemented compulsory conscription, all 18 year old able bodied Singapore males had to undergo training within the Armed Forces. When National servicemen completed their service term, some brought the many expletives they picked up during their service into the civilian world and thus became a part of the common culture in the city state. The word \"bloody\" also managed to spread to the north in neighbouring Malaysia, to where the influence of Singapore English has spread. The use of \"bloody\" as a substitute for more explicit language increased with the popularity of British and Australian films and television shows aired on local television programmes. The term ''bloody'' in Singapore may not be considered explicit, but its usage is frowned upon in formal settings.\n\nThe term is frequently used among [[South Africa]]ns in their colloquial English and it is an [[intensifier]]. It is used in both [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] and non-explicit ways. It also spread to [[Afrikaans]] as \"bloedige\" and is popular amongst all citizens in the country. It is also used by [[Minor (law)|minors]] and is not considered to be offensive.\n\n==Euphemisms==\nMany substitutions were devised{{year needed|date=November 2015}} to convey the essence of the oath, but with less offence; these included ''bleeding'', ''bleaking'', ''cruddy'', ''smuddy'', ''blinking'', ''blooming'', ''bally'', ''woundy'', '' flaming'' and ''ruddy''.\n\nPublications such as newspapers, police reports, and so on may{{year needed|date=November 2015}} print ''b__y'' instead of the full profanity.<ref name=\"OED\">{{Citation|title=Oxford English Dictionary.}}</ref> \nA spoken language equivalent is ''blankety'' or, less frequently, ''blanked'' or ''blanky''; the spoken words are all variations of ''blank'', which, as a verbal representation of a [[dash]], is used as a [[euphemism]] for a variety of \"bad\" words.<ref name=\"OED\"/>\n\n==In composition==\nUse of ''bloody'' as an adverbial or generic intensifier is to be distinguished from its fixed use in the expressions \"bloody murder\" and \"bloody hell\". In \"bloody murder\", it has the original sense of an adjective used literally. The [[King James Version]] of the Bible frequently uses ''bloody'' as an adjective in reference to bloodshed or violent crime, as in \"bloody crimes\" (Ezekiel 22:2), \"Woe to the bloody city\" (Ezekiel 24:6, Nahum 3:1). \"bloody men\" (26:9, Psalms 59:2, 139:19), etc. The expression of \"bloody murder\" goes back to at least Elizabethan English, as in Shakespeare's ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' (c. 1591), \"bloody murder or detested rape\".\nThe expression \"scream bloody murder\" (in the figurative or desemanticised sense of \"to loudly object to something\" attested since c. 1860)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/idioms/scream+bloody+murder |title=Idioms Dictionary &#124; Common Idioms and Phrases in English Language &#124; Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-24}}</ref> is now considered American English, while in British English, the euphemistic \"blue murder\" had replaced \"bloody murder\" during the period of \"bloody\" being considered taboo.<ref>[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-blu4.htm worldwidewords.org]</ref>\n\nThe expression \"bloody [[hell]]\" is now  used as a general expression of surprise or as a general intensifier; e.g. \"bloody hell\" being used repeatedly in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (2001, [[PG Rating]]). In March 2006 [[Australia]]'s national tourism commission launched an [[advertising campaign]] targeted at potential visitors in several English-speaking countries.  The ad sparked controversy because of its ending (in which a cheerful, bikini-clad spokeswoman delivers the ad's call-to-action by saying \"...[[so where the bloody hell are you?]]\"). In the UK the [[Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre|BACC]] required that a modified version of the ad be shown in the United Kingdom, without the word \"bloody\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/travel/bloody-ad-ban-incredibly-ludicrous/2007/03/28/1174761533507.html|title=Brit ban on 'bloody' ad 'incredibly ludicrous' - Travel|date=28 March 2007|website=Sunday Morning Herald|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315091147/http://www.smh.com.au/news/travel/bloody-ad-ban-incredibly-ludicrous/2007/03/28/1174761533507.html|archive-date=15 March 2016|url-status=dead|access-date=18 March 2018}}</ref> but in May 2006, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] ruled that the word ''bloody'' was not an inappropriate marketing tool and the original version of the ad was permitted to air.\n\nThe longer \"bloody hell-hounds\" appears to have been at least printable in early 19th century Britain.<ref>so in ''London Theatre: A Collection of the Most Celebrated Dramatic Pieces, Correctly Given, from Copies Used in the Theatres'' Volumes 11-12 (1815), p. 59 \"Bloody hell-hounds, I overheard you!\"</ref> \"Bloody hell's flames\" as well as \"bloody hell\" is reported as a profanity supposedly used by Catholics against Protestants in 1845.<ref>\nJohn Ryan, ''Popery unmasked.

His research interests are related to [[political ecology]]; the [[development anthropology|anthropology of development]], social movements; [[Latin American]] development and politics. Escobar's research uses critical techniques in his provocative analysis of development discourse and practice in general. He also explores possibilities for alternative visions for a [[Postdevelopment Theory|postdevelopment]] era.\n\nHe is a major figure in the post-development academic discourse, and a serious critic of development practices championed by western industrialized societies.

This led him to conclude that \"development planning was not only a problem to the extent that it failed; it was a problem even when it succeeded, because it so strongly set the terms for how people in poor countries could live\".<ref name=guard/> Citing Foucault marked a shift in the study of development from realism to interpretivist or [[post-structuralist]] approaches, which offered much more than an analysis of mainstream development economics or the sprawling array of development actors and institutions it spawned, giving rise to a coordinated and coherent set of interventions that Escobar calls the \"development apparatus\".\n\nEscobar theorizes that the development era was produced by a discursive construction contained in [[Harry S. Truman]]'s official representation of his administration's foreign policy. By referring to the three continents of South America, Africa, and Asia as \"underdeveloped\" and in need of significant change to achieve progress, Truman set in motion a reorganization of bureaucracy around thinking and acting to systematically change the \"[[third world]]\". In addition, he argues that Truman's discursive construction was infused with the imperatives of American [[social reproduction]] and [[American imperialism|imperial pretensions]]. As a result, the development apparatus functioned to support the consolidation of [[American hegemony]].\n\nEscobar encourages scholars to use [[ethnographic]] methods to further the post-development era by advancing the deconstructive creations initiated by contemporary social movements (without claiming universal applicability). Indeed, the Colombia case study in ''Encountering Development'' demonstrates that development economists' \"economization of food\" resulted in ambitious plans but not necessarily less hunger. A new 2011 edition of the book begins with a substantial new introduction, in which he argues that \"postdevelopment\" needs to be redefined and that a field of \"pluriversal studies\" would be helpful.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World'', Arturo Escobar (with a new preface by the author)|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9564.html|website=[[Princeton University Press]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Political ecology===\nEscobar received a fellowship from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] in 1997 to study \"Cultural and Biological Diversity in the Late Twentieth Century\".<ref name=umass/> This project culminated in the publication of his latest book, ''Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes'' by [[Duke University Press]] in 2008, which \"analyzes the politics of difference enacted by specific place-based ethnic and environmental movements in the context of [[Neoliberalism#Globalization|neoliberal globalization]]\".<ref name=amazon>{{cite web|title=''Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes'' (New Ecologies for the Twenty-First Century)|url=https://www.amazon.com/Territories-Difference-Movements-Ecologies-Twenty-First/dp/0822343274|website=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref> It was written after years of [[fieldwork]] in Colombia with a group of [[Afro-Colombian]] activists of [[Pacific/Choc\u00f3 natural region|Colombia\u2019s Pacific rainforest region]] called the ''Proceso de Comunidades Negras'' (PCN).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steiner|first1=Claudia|title=Territories of Difference: Place, Movements, Life, Redes (review)|journal=The Americas|date=April 2011|volume=67|issue=4|pages=573\u2013574.|doi=10.1353/tam.2011.0062}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*2018.
