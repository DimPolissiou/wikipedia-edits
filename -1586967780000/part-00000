''Saiga tatarica'') is a [[critically endangered]] [[antelope]] which during [[ancient history|antiquity]] inhabited a vast area of the [[Eurasian steppe]] spanning the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the northwest and [[Caucasus]] in the southwest into [[Mongolia]] in the northeast and [[Dzungaria]] in the southeast. During the [[Pleistocene]], they also occurred in [[Beringia]]n [[North America]] and the [[British Isles]]. Today, the dominant subspecies (''S. t. tatarica'') is only found in one region in [[Russia]] (in [[Kalmykia|the Republic of Kalmykia]] and [[Astrakhan Oblast]]) and three areas in [[Kazakhstan]] (the Ural, Ustiurt, and [[Betpak-Dala]] populations). A portion of the Ustiurt population migrates south to [[Uzbekistan]] and occasionally [[Turkmenistan]] in winter. It is extinct in [[China]] and southwestern Mongolia. It was hunted extensively in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]] until it became extinct in those regions at the end of the 18th century. The Mongolian subspecies (''S. t. mongolica'') is found only in western Mongolia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Neronov |first1=V. M. |last2=Arylova |first2=N. Yu. |last3=Dubinin |first3=M.

Weber]] coined the term \"Approval Voting\" in 1971.<ref>{{citation|title=Approval Voting|first1=Steven J.|last1=Brams|author1-link=Steven Brams|first2=Peter C.|last2=Fishburn|author2-link=Peter C.

Next to each name is a checkbox (or another similar way to mark \"Yes\" or \"No\" for that candidate).\n\nEach candidate may be treated as a separate question: \"Do you approve of this person for the job?\". Approval voting lets each voter indicate support for one, some, or all candidates. All votes count equally, and everyone gets the same number of votes: one vote per candidate, either for or against. Final tallies show how many voters support each candidate, and the winner is the candidate whom the most voters support.\n\nBallots on which the voter marked every candidate the same (whether yes or no) usually have no effect on the outcome of the election. Each ballot separates candidates into two groups: those supported and those that are not. Each candidate approved is considered preferred to any candidate not approved, while the voter's preferences among approved candidates is unspecified, and likewise, the voter's preferences among unapproved candidates is also unspecified.\n\nApproval voting can be considered a form of [[range voting]], with the range restricted to two values, 0 and 1\u2014or a form of [[majority judgment]], with grades restricted to ''good'' and ''poor''. \n\nApproval Voting can also be compared to [[plurality voting system|plurality voting]], without the rule that discards ballots that vote for more than one candidate. As an example:<blockquote>''Ten friends have to choose between three places for lunch: Kombucha Kick (''<u>K</u>''), Meatlover's Mansion (''<u>M</u>'') and Super Sushi (''<u>S</u>''), and they are deciding via a vote. If they vote for their favourite place, and each person gets only one vote, the results could end up with:'' 4 votes for Kombucha, 3 for Meatlover's and 3 for Sushi. ''This would result in the group going to Kombucha, even though 6 of the 10 people did not vote for Kombucha (especially if some people despise Kombucha).''</blockquote>An approval voting system would work by asking the group on which places they are ok with, allowing them multiple votes and simply tallying up which place has the most votes, appropriate for a social situation, as figuring out preferences and proportion can take too long for simple decisions such as lunch.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Applications ==\n=== History ===\n<span id=\"Historical_use\">Historically, several voting methods that incorporate aspects of approval voting have been used:</span>\n\n* Approving voting was used for [[papal conclave]]s between 1294 and 1621, with an average of about forty cardinals engaging in repeated rounds of voting until one candidate was listed on at least two-thirds of ballots.

Strategic Approval voting, with more than two options, involves the voter changing their approval threshold. The voter decides which options to give the ''same'' rating, even if they were to have a preference order between them.\n\nApproval voting allows for [[Tactical voting#Bullet voting|bullet voting]] and [[Tactical voting#Compromising|compromising]],  while it is immune to [[Tactical voting#Push-over|push-over]] and [[Tactical voting#Burying|burying]].\n\n[[Tactical voting#Bullet voting|Bullet Voting]] occurs when a voter approves ''only'' candidate 'a' instead of ''both'' 'a' and 'b' for the reason that voting for 'b' can cause 'a' to lose. The voter would be satisfied with either 'a' or 'b' but has a moderate preference for 'a'. Were 'b' to win, this hypothetical voter would still be satisfied.\n\n[[Tactical voting#Compromising|Compromising]] occurs when a voter approves an ''additional'' candidate who is otherwise considered unacceptable to the voter to prevent an even worse alternative from winning.\n\n=== Sincere voting ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2019}}Approval voting experts describe sincere votes as those \"... that directly reflect the true preferences of a voter, i.e., that do not report preferences 'falsely.'\"{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=29}}  They also give a specific definition of a sincere approval vote in terms of the voter's [[preference|ordinal preferences]] as being any vote that, if it votes for one candidate, it also votes for any more preferred candidate.  This definition allows a sincere vote to treat strictly preferred candidates the same, ensuring that every voter has at least one sincere vote. The definition also allows a sincere vote to treat equally preferred candidates differently.  When there are two or more candidates, every voter has at least three sincere approval votes to choose from.  Two of those sincere approval votes do not distinguish between any of the candidates: vote for none of the candidates and vote for all of the candidates.  When there are three or more candidates, every voter has more than one sincere approval vote that distinguishes between the candidates.\n\n==== Examples ====\n\nBased on the definition above, if there are four candidates, A, B, C, and D, and a voter has a strict preference order, preferring A to B to C to D, then the following are the voter's possible sincere approval votes:\n*vote for A, B, C, and D\n*vote for A, B, and C\n*vote for A and B\n*vote for A\n*vote for no candidates\n\nIf the voter instead equally prefers B and C, while A is still the most preferred candidate and D is the least preferred candidate, then all of the above votes are sincere and the following combination is also a sincere vote:\n*vote for A and C\n\nThe decision between the above ballots is equivalent to deciding an arbitrary \"approval cutoff.\" All candidates preferred to the cutoff are approved, all candidates less preferred are not approved, and any candidates equal to the cutoff may be approved or not arbitrarily.\n\n=== Sincere strategy with ordinal preferences ===\n\nA sincere voter with multiple options for voting sincerely still has to choose which sincere vote to use. [[tactical voting|Voting strategy]] is a way to make that choice, in which case strategic approval voting includes sincere voting, rather than being an alternative to it.<ref name=probstrat>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1955800 | last = Niemi |first=R.

In some cases, approval voting can sincerely elect any one of the candidates, including a [[Condorcet winner]] and a [[Condorcet loser]], without the voter preferences changing.  To the extent that electing a Condorcet winner and not electing a Condorcet loser is considered desirable outcomes for a voting system, approval voting can be considered vulnerable to sincere, strategic voting.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Yilmaz | first=M.

For a voter with dichotomous preferences, approval voting is [[strategy-proof]] (also known as strategy-free).{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=31}}  When all voters have dichotomous preferences and vote the sincere, strategy-proof vote, approval voting is guaranteed to elect the Condorcet winner, if one exists.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=38}}  However, having dichotomous preferences when there are three or more candidates is not typical.  It is an unlikely situation for all voters to have dichotomous preferences when there are more than a few voters.<ref name=probstrat/>\n\nHaving dichotomous preferences means that a voter has bi-level preferences for the candidates.  All of the candidates are divided into two groups such that the voter is indifferent between any two candidates in the same group and any candidate in the top-level group is preferred to any candidate in the bottom-level group.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=16\u201317}}  A voter that has strict preferences between three candidates\u2014prefers A to B and B to C\u2014does not have dichotomous preferences.\n\nBeing strategy-proof for a voter means that there is a unique way for the voter to vote that is a strategically best way to vote, regardless of how others vote. In approval voting, the strategy-proof vote, if it exists, is a sincere vote.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=29}}\n==== Approval threshold ====\n\nAnother way to deal with multiple sincere votes is to augment the ordinal preference model with an approval or acceptance threshold.  An approval threshold divides all of the candidates into two sets, those the voter approves of and those the voter does not approve of.  A voter can approve of more than one candidate and still prefer one approved candidate to another approved candidate.  Acceptance thresholds are similar.  With such a threshold, a voter simply votes for every candidate that meets or exceeds the threshold.<ref name=probstrat/>\n\nWith threshold voting, it is still possible to not elect the Condorcet winner and instead elect the Condorcet loser when they both exist.  However, according to Steven Brams, this represents a strength rather than a weakness of approval voting.  Without providing specifics, he argues that the pragmatic judgements of voters about which candidates are acceptable should take precedence over the [[Condorcet criterion]] and other social choice criteria.<ref name=critstrats>{{Cite journal |last1=Brams |first1=S.

On the one hand, approval voting fails the [[later-no-harm criterion]], so voting for a candidate can cause that candidate to win instead of a candidate more preferred by that voter.  On the other hand, approval voting satisfies the [[monotonicity criterion]], so not voting for a candidate can never help that candidate win, but can cause that candidate to lose to a less preferred candidate.  Either way, the voter can risk getting a less preferred election winner.  A voter can balance the risk-benefit trade-offs by considering the voter's cardinal utilities, particularly via the [[von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility theorem]], and the probabilities of how others vote.\n\nA [[Tactical voting#Myerson-Weber strategy|rational voter model]] described by [[Roger Myerson|Myerson]] and Weber specifies an approval voting strategy that votes for those candidates that have a positive prospective rating.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2938959 |last1=Myerson |first1=R. |last2=Weber |first2=R. J. | year = 1993 | title = A theory of Voting Equilibria | jstor = 2938959| journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 87 | issue = 1| pages = 102\u2013114 |url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/math/papers/782.pdf }}</ref>  This strategy is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the voter's [[Utility#Expected utility|expected utility]], subject to the constraints of the model and provided the number of other voters is sufficiently large.\n\nAn optimal approval vote always votes for the most preferred candidate and not for the least preferred candidate.  However, an optimal vote can require voting for a candidate and not voting for a more preferred candidate if there 4 candidates or more.<ref>Smith, Warren [http://scorevoting.net/WarrenSmithPages/homepage/newgibbsat.pdf Completion of Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility theorem; range voting and voter honesty]. Actually, there are no known examples of such situations for under 6 candidates, and definitely none for 3 candidates; the situation for 4 or 5 candidates is unknown.</ref>\n\nOther strategies are also available and coincide with the optimal strategy in special situations.  For example:\n* Vote for the candidates that have above average utility.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if the voter thinks that all pairwise ties are equally likely{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=85}}\n* Vote for any candidate that is more preferred than the expected winner and also vote for the expected winner if the expected winner is more preferred than the expected runner-up.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if there are three or fewer candidates or if the pivot probability for a tie between the expected winner and expected runner-up is sufficiently large compared to the other pivot probabilities.\n*Vote for the most preferred candidate only.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy when there is only one candidate with a positive prospective rating.\n\nAnother strategy is to vote for the top half of the candidates, the candidates that have an above-median utility. When the voter thinks that others are balancing their votes randomly and evenly, the strategy maximizes the voter's power or efficacy, meaning that it maximizes the probability that the voter will make a difference in deciding which candidate wins.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=74, 81}}\n\nOptimal strategic approval voting fails to satisfy the Condorcet criterion and can elect a [[Condorcet loser criterion|Condorcet loser]].  Strategic approval voting can guarantee electing the Condorcet winner in some special circumstances.  For example, if all voters are rational and cast a strategically optimal vote based on a common knowledge of how all the other voters vote except for small-probability, statistically independent errors in recording the votes, then the winner will be the Condorcet winner, if one exists.<ref>Laslier, J.-F.

As a result, they vote for any candidate with an above-average utility.  Most voters vote for only their first choice.  Only the Knoxville faction also votes for its second choice, Chattanooga.  As a result, the winner is Memphis, the Condorcet loser, with Chattanooga coming in second place.  In this scenario, the winner has minority approval (more voters disapproved than approved) and all the others had even less support, reflecting the position that no choice gave an above-average utility to a majority of voters.\n\nIn the second scenario, all of the voters expect that Memphis is the likely winner, that Chattanooga is the likely runner-up, and that the pivot probability for a Memphis-Chattanooga tie is much larger than the pivot probabilities of any other pair-wise ties.  As a result, each voter votes for any candidate they prefer more than the leading candidate, and also vote for the leading candidate if they prefer that candidate more than the expected runner-up. Each remaining scenario follows a similar pattern of expectations and voting strategies.\n\nIn the second scenario, there is a three-way tie for first place.  This happens because the expected winner, Memphis, was the Condorcet loser and was also ranked last by any voter that did not rank it first.\n\nOnly in the last scenario does the actual winner and runner-up match the expected winner and runner-up.  As a result, this can be considered a stable strategic voting scenario. In the language of [[game theory]], this is an \"equilibrium.\"  In this scenario, the winner is also the Condorcet winner.\n\n===Dichotomous cutoff===\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2019}}As this voting method is cardinal rather than ordinal, it is possible to model voters in a way that does not simplify to an ordinal method. Modelling voters with a 'dichotomous cutoff' assumes a voter has an immovable approval cutoff, while having meaningful cardinal preferences. This means that rather than voting for their top 3 candidates, or all candidates above the average approval (which may result in their vote changing if one candidate drops out, resulting in a system that does not satisfy IIA), they instead vote for all candidates above a certain approval 'cutoff' that they have decided. This cutoff does not change, regardless of which and how many candidates are running, so when all available alternatives are either above or below the cutoff, the voter votes for all or none of the candidates, despite preferring some over others.  While this extreme appears unrealistic, it actually reflects reality in the way that many voters become disenfranchised and apathetic if they see no candidates they approve of. In this way, there is evidence to suggest that many voters may have an internal cutoff, and would not simply vote for their top 3, or the above average candidates, although that is not to say that it is necessarily entirely immovable.\n\nFor example, in this scenario, voters are voting for candidates with approval above 50% (bold signifies that the voters voted for the candidate):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:600px;\"\n|-\n!

On the other hand, if voters' threshold for receiving a vote is fixed (say 50%), this is a dichotomous cutoff, and satisfies IIA as shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:600px;\"\n|+ A drops out, candidates voting for above average approval\n!

In this case, approval voting requires voters to make an additional decision of where to put their approval cutoff (see examples above).

Plurality voting can lead to voters abandoning their first choice in order to help a \"lesser of evils\" to win.\n* However, approval voting forces voters to face an initial voting tactical decision as to whether to vote for (or ''approve'') of their second-choice candidate or not. The voter may want to retain expression of preference of their favorite candidate over their second choice.  But that does not allow the same voter to express preference of their second choice over any other.\n* Approval ballots can be counted by existing machines designed for plurality elections, as ballots are cast, so that final tallies are immediately available after the election, without any upgrades to equipment. Approval counting can be completed at the local level and conveniently summed at the regional or national level.\n* If voters are sincere, approval voting would elect centrists at least as often as moderates of each extreme. If backers of relatively extreme candidates are insincere and \"bullet vote\" for that first choice, they can help that candidate defeat a compromise candidate who would have won if every voter had cast sincere preferences.\n* If voters are sincere, candidates trying to win an approval voting election might need as much as 100% approval to beat a strong competitor, and would have to find solutions that are fair to everyone to do so. However, a candidate may win a [[plurality voting system|plurality]] race by promising many perks to a simple majority or even a plurality of voters at the expense of the smaller voting groups.\n* Approval voting fails the majority criterion, because a candidate who is preferred by a majority of voters is not always elected. In some cases approval voting will elect a candidate that has greater overall utility than a candidate preferred by a mere majority, if the majority also approves a compromise candidate that includes representation of the minority. In other cases, with elections having three or more candidates, approval voting will fail to elect the candidate with greater overall utility also preferred by a majority, if a less moderate candidate within the majority view gains enough approvals from the majority to win, while core supporters of the less moderate candidate are more selective (i.e. vote only for the extreme candidate), leaving a third sizable minority unrepresented.  It can also fail a different majority criterion in that the winner can win with fewer than half the votes approving. \n* Suppose a candidate is eliminated (say, for medical reasons) between a primary election and the party convention. With plurality voting, voters who supported the eliminated candidate lose their franchise. Approval voting affords representation to voters by counting their approvals among remaining candidates.\n* Approval voting without write-ins is easily reversed as [[disapproval voting]] where a choice is disavowed, as is already required in other measures in politics (e.g., representative [[recall election|recall]]).\n* Unlike plurality voting, approval voting allows voters to block a candidate by voting for several alternatives instead of just one, increasing the probability an alternative wins.\n* In contentious elections with large groups of organized voters who prefer their favorite candidate vastly over all others, approval voting may revert to [[plurality voting]]. Some voters support only their single favored candidate when they perceive the other candidates more as competitors to their preferred candidate than as compromise choices. Score voting and [[Majority Judgment]] allow these voters to give intermediate approval ratings, but at the cost of added ballot complexity and longer ballot counts.\n\n== Multiple winners ==\n\nApproval voting can be extended to multiple winner elections. A related method is [[Multiple non-transferable vote|plurality-at-large voting]] where each voter can select an unlimited number of candidates and the candidates with the most approval votes win. This does not provide [[proportional representation]] and is subject to the [[Burr dilemma]], among other problems. Therefore, voting reform advocates refrain from calling it ''approval voting.''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.electionscience.org/library/voting-systems-confused-with-approval-voting/ |title=Voting Systems Confused with Approval Voting |website=The Center for Election Science |access-date=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n\nProportional ways of extending Approval voting to multiple winner elections have been devised.

The simplest form is a blank ballot on which voters hand-write the names of the candidates they support. A more structured ballot lists all candidates, and voters mark each candidate they support. A more explicit structured ballot can list the candidates and provide two choices by each. (Candidate list ballots can include spaces for write-in candidates as well.)\n{| BORDER\n|-\n| [[File:Approvalballotname.png|160px]]\n| [[File:Approvalballotword.png|160px]]\n| [[File:Approvalballotmark.png|160px]]\n| [[File:Approvalballotchoice.png|160px]]\n|}\n\nAll four ballots are theoretically equivalent. The more structured ballots may aid voters in offering clear votes so they explicitly know all their choices. The Yes/No format can help to detect an \"undervote\" when a candidate is left unmarked and allow the voter a second chance to confirm the ballot markings are correct. The \"single bubble\" format is incapable of producing invalid ballots (which might otherwise be rejected in counting).\n\nUnless the second or fourth format is used, fraudulently adding votes to an approval voting ballot does not invalidate the ballot (that is, it does not make it appear inconsistent). Thus, approval voting raises the importance of ensuring that the \"chain of custody\" of ballots is secure.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Politics}}\n* [[Voting system]] \u2013 many other ways of voting\n* [[Borda count]]\n* [[Bucklin voting]]\n* [[Condorcet method]]\n* [[First Past the Post]] (also called Single-Member Plurality or Relative Majority)\n* [[Instant-runoff voting]] (also called Ranked-Choice voting, Alternative voting and Preferential voting)\n* [[Score Voting]] (also called Range voting)\n* [[Schulze method]]\n* [[Proportional approval voting]] and [[Sequential proportional approval voting]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Brams |first1=Steven J. |last2=Fishburn |first2=Peter C. |date=1983 |title=Approval Voting |location=Boston |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |isbn=3764331240 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/approvalvoting00bram }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|approval}}\n* [http://www.electology.org/approval-voting Approval Voting] Article by [http://www.electology.org/ The Center for Election Science]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZiS3U7EG0M Could Approval Voting Prevent Electoral Disaster?] Video by [[Big Think]]\n* [http://pareto.uab.cat/wp/2004/61904.pdf Approval Voting on Dichotomous Preferences] Article by Marc Vorsatz.\n* [http://pareto.uab.cat/wp/2004/61704.pdf Scoring Rules on Dichotomous Preferences] Article by Marc Vorsatz.\n* [http://www.universalworkshop.com/ARVOfull.htm The Arithmetic of Voting] article by Guy Ottewell\n* [http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/brams/avcritical.pdf Critical Strategies Under Approval Voting: Who Gets Ruled In And Ruled Out] Article by Steven J.

Next to each name is a checkbox (or another similar way to mark \"Yes\" or \"No\" for that candidate).\n\nEach candidate may be treated as a separate question: \"Do you approve of this person for the job?\". Approval voting lets each voter indicate support for one, some, or all candidates. All votes count equally, and everyone gets the same number of votes: one vote per candidate, either for or against. Final tallies show how many voters support each candidate, and the winner is the candidate whom the most voters support.\n\nBallots on which the voter marked every candidate the same (whether yes or no) usually have no effect on the outcome of the election. Each ballot separates candidates into two groups: those supported and those that are not. Each candidate approved is considered preferred to any candidate not approved, while the voter's preferences among approved candidates is unspecified, and likewise, the voter's preferences among unapproved candidates is also unspecified.\n\nApproval voting can be considered a form of [[range voting]], with the range restricted to two values, 0 and 1\u2014or a form of [[majority judgment]], with grades restricted to ''good'' and ''poor''. \n\nApproval Voting can also be compared to [[plurality voting system|plurality voting]], without the rule that discards ballots that vote for more than one candidate. As an example:<blockquote>''Ten friends have to choose between three places for lunch: Kombucha Kick (''<u>K</u>''), Meatlover's Mansion (''<u>M</u>'') and Super Sushi (''<u>S</u>''), and they are deciding via a vote. If they vote for their favourite place, and each person gets only one vote, the results could end up with:'' 4 votes for Kombucha, 3 for Meatlover's and 3 for Sushi. ''This would result in the group going to Kombucha, even though 6 of the 10 people did not vote for Kombucha (especially if some people despise Kombucha).''</blockquote>An approval voting system would work by asking the group on which places they are ok with, allowing them multiple votes and simply tallying up which place has the most votes, appropriate for a social situation, as figuring out preferences and proportion can take too long for simple decisions such as lunch.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Applications ==\n=== History ===\n<span id=\"Historical_use\">Historically, several voting methods that incorporate aspects of approval voting have been used:</span>\n\n* Approving voting was used for [[papal conclave]]s between 1294 and 1621, with an average of about forty cardinals engaging in repeated rounds of voting until one candidate was listed on at least two-thirds of ballots.

Strategic Approval voting, with more than two options, involves the voter changing their approval threshold. The voter decides which options to give the ''same'' rating, even if they were to have a preference order between them.\n\nApproval voting allows for [[Tactical voting#Bullet voting|bullet voting]] and [[Tactical voting#Compromising|compromising]],  while it is immune to [[Tactical voting#Push-over|push-over]] and [[Tactical voting#Burying|burying]].\n\n[[Tactical voting#Bullet voting|Bullet Voting]] occurs when a voter approves ''only'' candidate 'a' instead of ''both'' 'a' and 'b' for the reason that voting for 'b' can cause 'a' to lose. The voter would be satisfied with either 'a' or 'b' but has a moderate preference for 'a'. Were 'b' to win, this hypothetical voter would still be satisfied.\n\n[[Tactical voting#Compromising|Compromising]] occurs when a voter approves an ''additional'' candidate who is otherwise considered unacceptable to the voter to prevent an even worse alternative from winning.\n\n=== Sincere voting ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2019}}Approval voting experts describe sincere votes as those \"... that directly reflect the true preferences of a voter, i.e., that do not report preferences 'falsely.'\"{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=29}}  They also give a specific definition of a sincere approval vote in terms of the voter's [[preference|ordinal preferences]] as being any vote that, if it votes for one candidate, it also votes for any more preferred candidate.  This definition allows a sincere vote to treat strictly preferred candidates the same, ensuring that every voter has at least one sincere vote. The definition also allows a sincere vote to treat equally preferred candidates differently.  When there are two or more candidates, every voter has at least three sincere approval votes to choose from.  Two of those sincere approval votes do not distinguish between any of the candidates: vote for none of the candidates and vote for all of the candidates.  When there are three or more candidates, every voter has more than one sincere approval vote that distinguishes between the candidates.\n\n==== Examples ====\n\nBased on the definition above, if there are four candidates, A, B, C, and D, and a voter has a strict preference order, preferring A to B to C to D, then the following are the voter's possible sincere approval votes:\n*vote for A, B, C, and D\n*vote for A, B, and C\n*vote for A and B\n*vote for A\n*vote for no candidates\n\nIf the voter instead equally prefers B and C, while A is still the most preferred candidate and D is the least preferred candidate, then all of the above votes are sincere and the following combination is also a sincere vote:\n*vote for A and C\n\nThe decision between the above ballots is equivalent to deciding an arbitrary \"approval cutoff.\" All candidates preferred to the cutoff are approved, all candidates less preferred are not approved, and any candidates equal to the cutoff may be approved or not arbitrarily.\n\n=== Sincere strategy with ordinal preferences ===\n\nA sincere voter with multiple options for voting sincerely still has to choose which sincere vote to use. [[tactical voting|Voting strategy]] is a way to make that choice, in which case strategic approval voting includes sincere voting, rather than being an alternative to it.<ref name=probstrat>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1955800 | last = Niemi |first=R.

In some cases, approval voting can sincerely elect any one of the candidates, including a [[Condorcet winner]] and a [[Condorcet loser]], without the voter preferences changing.  To the extent that electing a Condorcet winner and not electing a Condorcet loser is considered desirable outcomes for a voting system, approval voting can be considered vulnerable to sincere, strategic voting.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Yilmaz | first=M.

For a voter with dichotomous preferences, approval voting is [[strategy-proof]] (also known as strategy-free).{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=31}}  When all voters have dichotomous preferences and vote the sincere, strategy-proof vote, approval voting is guaranteed to elect the Condorcet winner, if one exists.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=38}}  However, having dichotomous preferences when there are three or more candidates is not typical.  It is an unlikely situation for all voters to have dichotomous preferences when there are more than a few voters.<ref name=probstrat/>\n\nHaving dichotomous preferences means that a voter has bi-level preferences for the candidates.  All of the candidates are divided into two groups such that the voter is indifferent between any two candidates in the same group and any candidate in the top-level group is preferred to any candidate in the bottom-level group.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=16\u201317}}  A voter that has strict preferences between three candidates\u2014prefers A to B and B to C\u2014does not have dichotomous preferences.\n\nBeing strategy-proof for a voter means that there is a unique way for the voter to vote that is a strategically best way to vote, regardless of how others vote. In approval voting, the strategy-proof vote, if it exists, is a sincere vote.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=29}}\n==== Approval threshold ====\n\nAnother way to deal with multiple sincere votes is to augment the ordinal preference model with an approval or acceptance threshold.  An approval threshold divides all of the candidates into two sets, those the voter approves of and those the voter does not approve of.  A voter can approve of more than one candidate and still prefer one approved candidate to another approved candidate.  Acceptance thresholds are similar.  With such a threshold, a voter simply votes for every candidate that meets or exceeds the threshold.<ref name=probstrat/>\n\nWith threshold voting, it is still possible to not elect the Condorcet winner and instead elect the Condorcet loser when they both exist.  However, according to Steven Brams, this represents a strength rather than a weakness of approval voting.  Without providing specifics, he argues that the pragmatic judgements of voters about which candidates are acceptable should take precedence over the [[Condorcet criterion]] and other social choice criteria.<ref name=critstrats>{{Cite journal |last1=Brams |first1=S.

On the one hand, approval voting fails the [[later-no-harm criterion]], so voting for a candidate can cause that candidate to win instead of a candidate more preferred by that voter.  On the other hand, approval voting satisfies the [[monotonicity criterion]], so not voting for a candidate can never help that candidate win, but can cause that candidate to lose to a less preferred candidate.  Either way, the voter can risk getting a less preferred election winner.  A voter can balance the risk-benefit trade-offs by considering the voter's cardinal utilities, particularly via the [[von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility theorem]], and the probabilities of how others vote.\n\nA [[Tactical voting#Myerson-Weber strategy|rational voter model]] described by [[Roger Myerson|Myerson]] and Weber specifies an approval voting strategy that votes for those candidates that have a positive prospective rating.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2938959 |last1=Myerson |first1=R. |last2=Weber |first2=R.

However, an optimal vote can require voting for a candidate and not voting for a more preferred candidate if there 4 candidates or more.<ref>Smith, Warren [http://scorevoting.net/WarrenSmithPages/homepage/newgibbsat.pdf Completion of Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility theorem; range voting and voter honesty]. Actually, there are no known examples of such situations for under 6 candidates, and definitely none for 3 candidates; the situation for 4 or 5 candidates is unknown.</ref>\n\nOther strategies are also available and coincide with the optimal strategy in special situations.  For example:\n* Vote for the candidates that have above average utility.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if the voter thinks that all pairwise ties are equally likely{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=85}}\n* Vote for any candidate that is more preferred than the expected winner and also vote for the expected winner if the expected winner is more preferred than the expected runner-up.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if there are three or fewer candidates or if the pivot probability for a tie between the expected winner and expected runner-up is sufficiently large compared to the other pivot probabilities.\n*Vote for the most preferred candidate only.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy when there is only one candidate with a positive prospective rating.\n\nAnother strategy is to vote for the top half of the candidates, the candidates that have an above-median utility. When the voter thinks that others are balancing their votes randomly and evenly, the strategy maximizes the voter's power or efficacy, meaning that it maximizes the probability that the voter will make a difference in deciding which candidate wins.{{sfn|Brams|Fishburn|1983|p=74, 81}}\n\nOptimal strategic approval voting fails to satisfy the Condorcet criterion and can elect a [[Condorcet loser criterion|Condorcet loser]].  Strategic approval voting can guarantee electing the Condorcet winner in some special circumstances.  For example, if all voters are rational and cast a strategically optimal vote based on a common knowledge of how all the other voters vote except for small-probability, statistically independent errors in recording the votes, then the winner will be the Condorcet winner, if one exists.<ref>Laslier, J.-F.

The utilities are consistent with the rankings given earlier and reflect a strong preference each faction has for choosing its city, compared to weaker preferences for other factors such as the distance to the other cities.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Voter utilities for each candidate city\n! &nbsp; !! colspan=\"4\" | Candidates !! &nbsp;\n|-\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Fraction of voters<br /><small>(living close to)</small>\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Memphis\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Nashville\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Chattanooga\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Knoxville\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Average\n|- style=\"xbackground:#fdd; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Memphis (42%)\n| 100 || 15 || 10 || 0 || 31.25\n|- style=\"xbackground:#cfc; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Nashville (26%)\n| 0 || 100 || 20 || 15 || 33.75\n|- style=\"xbackground:#ddf; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Chattanooga (15%)\n| 0 || 15 || 100 || 35 || 37.5\n|- style=\"xbackground:#fed; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Knoxville (17%)\n| 0 || 15 || 40 || 100 || 38.75\n|}\n\nUsing these utilities, voters choose their optimal strategic votes based on what they think the various pivot probabilities are for pairwise ties.  In each of the scenarios summarized below, all voters share a common set of pivot probabilities.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Approval voting results <br /> for scenarios using optimal strategic voting\n! colspan=\"3\" | &nbsp; !! colspan=\"4\" | Candidate vote totals\n|-\n! xwidth=25% | Strategy scenario\n! xwidth=15% | Winner\n! xwidth=15% | Runner-up\n! xwidth=15% | Memphis\n! xwidth=15% | Nashville\n! xwidth=15% | Chattanooga\n! xwidth=15% | Knoxville\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Zero-info\n| Memphis || Chattanooga || 42 || 26 || 32 || 17\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Memphis leading Chattanooga\n| colspan=\"2\" | Three-way tie || 42 || 58 || 58 || 58\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Chattanooga leading Knoxville\n| Chattanooga || Nashville || 42 || 68 || 83 || 17\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Chattanooga leading Nashville\n| Nashville || Memphis || 42 || 68 || 32 || 17\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Nashville leading Memphis\n| Nashville || Memphis || 42 || 58 || 32 || 32\n|}\n\nIn the first scenario, voters all choose their votes based on the assumption that all pairwise ties are equally likely.  As a result, they vote for any candidate with an above-average utility.  Most voters vote for only their first choice.  Only the Knoxville faction also votes for its second choice, Chattanooga.  As a result, the winner is Memphis, the Condorcet loser, with Chattanooga coming in second place.  In this scenario, the winner has minority approval (more voters disapproved than approved) and all the others had even less support, reflecting the position that no choice gave an above-average utility to a majority of voters.\n\nIn the second scenario, all of the voters expect that Memphis is the likely winner, that Chattanooga is the likely runner-up, and that the pivot probability for a Memphis-Chattanooga tie is much larger than the pivot probabilities of any other pair-wise ties.  As a result, each voter votes for any candidate they prefer more than the leading candidate, and also vote for the leading candidate if they prefer that candidate more than the expected runner-up. Each remaining scenario follows a similar pattern of expectations and voting strategies.\n\nIn the second scenario, there is a three-way tie for first place.  This happens because the expected winner, Memphis, was the Condorcet loser and was also ranked last by any voter that did not rank it first.\n\nOnly in the last scenario does the actual winner and runner-up match the expected winner and runner-up.  As a result, this can be considered a stable strategic voting scenario. In the language of [[game theory]], this is an \"equilibrium.\"  In this scenario, the winner is also the Condorcet winner.\n\n===Dichotomous cutoff===\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2019}}As this voting method is cardinal rather than ordinal, it is possible to model voters in a way that does not simplify to an ordinal method. Modelling voters with a 'dichotomous cutoff' assumes a voter has an immovable approval cutoff, while having meaningful cardinal preferences. This means that rather than voting for their top 3 candidates, or all candidates above the average approval (which may result in their vote changing if one candidate drops out, resulting in a system that does not satisfy IIA), they instead vote for all candidates above a certain approval 'cutoff' that they have decided. This cutoff does not change, regardless of which and how many candidates are running, so when all available alternatives are either above or below the cutoff, the voter votes for all or none of the candidates, despite preferring some over others.  While this extreme appears unrealistic, it actually reflects reality in the way that many voters become disenfranchised and apathetic if they see no candidates they approve of. In this way, there is evidence to suggest that many voters may have an internal cutoff, and would not simply vote for their top 3, or the above average candidates, although that is not to say that it is necessarily entirely immovable.\n\nFor example, in this scenario, voters are voting for candidates with approval above 50% (bold signifies that the voters voted for the candidate):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:600px;\"\n|-\n!

On the other hand, if voters' threshold for receiving a vote is fixed (say 50%), this is a dichotomous cutoff, and satisfies IIA as shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:600px;\"\n|+ A drops out, candidates voting for above average approval\n!

In this case, approval voting requires voters to make an additional decision of where to put their approval cutoff (see examples above). Depending on how this decision is made, approval voting satisfies different sets of criteria.\n\nThere is no ultimate authority on which criteria should be considered, but the following are criteria that many voting theorists accept and consider desirable:\n* [[Unrestricted domain]]\u2014A voter may have any preference ordering among the alternatives.\n* [[Non-dictatorship]]\u2014There does not exist a single voter whose preference for the alternatives always determines the outcome regardless of other voters' preferences.\n* [[Pareto efficiency]]\u2014If every voter prefers candidate A to all other candidates, then A must be elected. (from [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]])\n* [[Majority criterion]]\u2014If there exists a majority that ranks (or rates) a single candidate higher than all other candidates, does that candidate always win?\n* [[Monotonicity criterion]]\u2014Is it impossible to cause a winning candidate to lose by ranking that candidate higher, or to cause a losing candidate to win by ranking that candidate lower?\n* [[Consistency criterion]]\u2014If the electorate is divided in two and a choice wins in both parts, does it always win overall?\n* [[Participation criterion]]\u2014Is voting honestly always better than not voting at all? (This is grouped with the distinct but similar Consistency Criterion in the table below.{{efn|Consistency implies participation, but not vice versa. For example, Score Voting complies with participation and consistency, but median ratings satisfies participation and fails consistency.}})\n* [[Condorcet criterion]]\u2014If a candidate beats every other candidate in [[Condorcet method|pairwise comparison]], does that candidate always win? (This implies the majority criterion, above)\n* [[Condorcet loser criterion]]\u2014If a candidate loses to every other candidate in pairwise comparison, does that candidate always lose?\n* [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]]\u2014Is the outcome the same after adding or removing non-winning candidates?\n* [[Independence of clones criterion]]\u2014Is the outcome the same if candidates identical to existing candidates are added?\n* [[Reversal symmetry]]\u2014If individual preferences of each voter are inverted, does the original winner never win?\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=2 | !!

Plurality voting can lead to voters abandoning their first choice in order to help a \"lesser of evils\" to win.\n* However, approval voting forces voters to face an initial voting tactical decision as to whether to vote for (or ''approve'') of their second-choice candidate or not. The voter may want to retain expression of preference of their favorite candidate over their second choice.  But that does not allow the same voter to express preference of their second choice over any other.\n* Approval ballots can be counted by existing machines designed for plurality elections, as ballots are cast, so that final tallies are immediately available after the election, without any upgrades to equipment. Approval counting can be completed at the local level and conveniently summed at the regional or national level.\n* If voters are sincere, approval voting would elect centrists at least as often as moderates of each extreme. If backers of relatively extreme candidates are insincere and \"bullet vote\" for that first choice, they can help that candidate defeat a compromise candidate who would have won if every voter had cast sincere preferences.\n* If voters are sincere, candidates trying to win an approval voting election might need as much as 100% approval to beat a strong competitor, and would have to find solutions that are fair to everyone to do so. However, a candidate may win a [[plurality voting system|plurality]] race by promising many perks to a simple majority or even a plurality of voters at the expense of the smaller voting groups.\n* Approval voting fails the majority criterion, because a candidate who is preferred by a majority of voters is not always elected. In some cases approval voting will elect a candidate that has greater overall utility than a candidate preferred by a mere majority, if the majority also approves a compromise candidate that includes representation of the minority. In other cases, with elections having three or more candidates, approval voting will fail to elect the candidate with greater overall utility also preferred by a majority, if a less moderate candidate within the majority view gains enough approvals from the majority to win, while core supporters of the less moderate candidate are more selective (i.e. vote only for the extreme candidate), leaving a third sizable minority unrepresented.  It can also fail a different majority criterion in that the winner can win with fewer than half the votes approving. \n* Suppose a candidate is eliminated (say, for medical reasons) between a primary election and the party convention. With plurality voting, voters who supported the eliminated candidate lose their franchise. Approval voting affords representation to voters by counting their approvals among remaining candidates.\n* Approval voting without write-ins is easily reversed as [[disapproval voting]] where a choice is disavowed, as is already required in other measures in politics (e.g., representative [[recall election|recall]]).\n* Unlike plurality voting, approval voting allows voters to block a candidate by voting for several alternatives instead of just one, increasing the probability an alternative wins.\n* In contentious elections with large groups of organized voters who prefer their favorite candidate vastly over all others, approval voting may revert to [[plurality voting]]. Some voters support only their single favored candidate when they perceive the other candidates more as competitors to their preferred candidate than as compromise choices. Score voting and [[Majority Judgment]] allow these voters to give intermediate approval ratings, but at the cost of added ballot complexity and longer ballot counts.\n\n== Multiple winners ==\n\nApproval voting can be extended to multiple winner elections. A related method is [[Multiple non-transferable vote|plurality-at-large voting]] where each voter can select an unlimited number of candidates and the candidates with the most approval votes win. This does not provide [[proportional representation]] and is subject to the [[Burr dilemma]], among other problems. Therefore, voting reform advocates refrain from calling it ''approval voting.''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.electionscience.org/library/voting-systems-confused-with-approval-voting/ |title=Voting Systems Confused with Approval Voting |website=The Center for Election Science |access-date=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n\nProportional ways of extending Approval voting to multiple winner elections have been devised. Among these are [[satisfaction approval voting]] and [[proportional approval voting]]<ref>{{cite book|citeseerx=10.1.1.74.3284|title=Technologies for political representation and accountability|first=Enric|last=Plaza|accessdate=2011-06-17|url=http://www.iiia.csic.es/~enric/papers/egov.pdf}}</ref> for determining a proportional assembly, and minimax approval<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1145/1329125.1329365|url=http://pages.cs.aueb.gr/~markakis/research/aamas07-minmax.pdf|first1=Rob|title=Proceedings of the 6th international joint conference on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems - AAMAS '07|pages=1|last1=LeGrand|first2=Evangelos|last2=Markakis|first3=Aranyak|last3=Mehta|accessdate=2011-06-17|year=2007|isbn=9788190426275}}</ref> for determining a consensus assembly where the least satisfied voter is satisfied the most.\n\n== Ballot types ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2019}}Approval ballots can be of at least four semi-distinct forms. The simplest form is a blank ballot on which voters hand-write the names of the candidates they support. A more structured ballot lists all candidates, and voters mark each candidate they support. A more explicit structured ballot can list the candidates and provide two choices by each. (Candidate list ballots can include spaces for write-in candidates as well.)\n{| BORDER\n|-\n| [[File:Approvalballotname.png|160px]]\n| [[File:Approvalballotword.png|160px]]\n| [[File:Approvalballotmark.png|160px]]\n| [[File:Approvalballotchoice.png|160px]]\n|}\n\nAll four ballots are theoretically equivalent. The more structured ballots may aid voters in offering clear votes so they explicitly know all their choices. The Yes/No format can help to detect an \"undervote\" when a candidate is left unmarked and allow the voter a second chance to confirm the ballot markings are correct. The \"single bubble\" format is incapable of producing invalid ballots (which might otherwise be rejected in counting).\n\nUnless the second or fourth format is used, fraudulently adding votes to an approval voting ballot does not invalidate the ballot (that is, it does not make it appear inconsistent). Thus, approval voting raises the importance of ensuring that the \"chain of custody\" of ballots is secure.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Politics}}\n* [[Voting system]] \u2013 many other ways of voting\n* [[Borda count]]\n* [[Bucklin voting]]\n* [[Condorcet method]]\n* [[First Past the Post]] (also called Single-Member Plurality or Relative Majority)\n* [[Instant-runoff voting]] (also called Ranked-Choice voting, Alternative voting and Preferential voting)\n* [[Score Voting]] (also called Range voting)\n* [[Schulze method]]\n* [[Proportional approval voting]] and [[Sequential proportional approval voting]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Brams |first1=Steven J. |last2=Fishburn |first2=Peter C. |date=1983 |title=Approval Voting |location=Boston |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |isbn=3764331240 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/approvalvoting00bram }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|approval}}\n* [http://www.electology.org/approval-voting Approval Voting] Article by [http://www.electology.org/ The Center for Election Science]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZiS3U7EG0M Could Approval Voting Prevent Electoral Disaster?] Video by [[Big Think]]\n* [http://pareto.uab.cat/wp/2004/61904.pdf Approval Voting on Dichotomous Preferences] Article by Marc Vorsatz.\n* [http://pareto.uab.cat/wp/2004/61704.pdf Scoring Rules on Dichotomous Preferences] Article by Marc Vorsatz.\n* [http://www.universalworkshop.com/ARVOfull.htm The Arithmetic of Voting] article by Guy Ottewell\n* [http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/brams/avcritical.pdf Critical Strategies Under Approval Voting: Who Gets Ruled In And Ruled Out] Article by Steven J.

A related term, {{math|''p''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, is the ratio {{math|''Q''<sub>''k''</sub> ''/'' ''Q''<sub>''total''</sub>}}, which describes the fractional energy released. The term {{math|&kappa;<sub>1</sub>}} is the variance in natural time:<ref>Varotsos, Sarlis & Skordas 2011 (book), pages 121 & 131</ref>\n\n: <math>\\kappa_1=\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k(\\chi_k)^2 - \\bigl(\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k\\chi_k\\bigr)^2</math>\n\n: where <math>\\textstyle\\chi_k=k/N</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\ p_k=\\frac{Q_k}{\\sum_{n=1}^N Q_n}</math>\n\n== Time reversal ==\nTime reversal, in contrast to clock time, is applicable when studying the approach of a system to criticality with natural time analysis. Living systems for example are considered to operate far from [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] as there is flow of energy crossing their boundaries, in contrast to deseased organisms where inner driving forces are absent. While time irreversibility is a fundamental property of a living system, the state of death is more time reversible by means of energy flow across the system's boundaries. Thus a critical state of a system can be estimated by applying natural time analysis upon calculating the [[entropy]] upon both normal time flow and time reversal and studying the difference of the two results.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":0\" />[[File:Natural time as applied in cardiology.jpg|thumb|(a) [[Electrocardiography|ECG]] in which the RR distances are marked<br />\n(b) the same ECG plotted in (a) but read in natural time analysis<br />\n(c) ECG at conventional time upon time reversal<br />\n(d) ECG upon time reversal in natural time analysis<br />\nThe length between RR distances in conventional time is aproximately considered as the energy of each pulse (event) in natural time analysis.|400px|alt=|center]]\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Seismology ===\n\n==== Earthquake nowcasting ====\nIn [[seismology]], nowcasting is the estimate of the current dynamic state of a seismological system.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> It differs from forecasting which aims to estimate the probability of a future event<ref name=\":5\" /> but it is also considered a potential base for forecasting.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Nowcasting is based on the [[earthquake cycle]] model, a recurring cycle between pairs of large earthquakes in a geographical area, upon which the system is evaluated using natural time analysis.<ref name=\":1\" /> Nowcasting calculations produce the \"earthquake potential score\", an estimation of the current level of seismic progress.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhen applied to seismicity, natural time analysis has the following advantages:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n# Declustering of the aftershocks is not necessary as natural time count is evenly valid in any case of aftershock or backgroung seismicity.\n# Natural time statistics do not depend on the level of seismicity, given that the [[Gutenberg\u2013Richter law|b value]] does not significantly vary.\n\nTypical applications are: great global earthquakes and [[Tsunami|tsunamis]],<ref name=\":6\" /> aftershocks and [[induced seismicity]],<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> induced seismicity at [[Gas field|gas fields]],<ref name=\":7\" /> seismic risk to global megacities,<ref name=\":5\" /> studying of [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] of large global earthquakes,<ref name=\":8\" /> etc.\n\n==== Earthquake prediction ====\nNatural time analysis has been initially applied to [[VAN method]] in order to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the time of a forthcoming earthquake that has been indicated to occur by seismic eletric signals (SES). The method deems SES valid when \u03ba<sub>1</sub> = 0.070. Once the SES are deemed valid, a second NT analysis is started in which the subsequent seismic (rather than electric) events are noted, and the region is divided up as a [[Venn diagram]] with at least two seismic events per overlapping rectangle. When \u03ba<sub>1</sub> approaches the value \u03ba<sub>1</sub> = 0.070 for the candidate region, a critical seismic event is considered imminent, i.e. it will occur in a few days to one week or so.<ref>Varotsos, Sarlis & Skordas 2011 (book), chapter 7</ref>\n\n=== Cardiology ===\nNatural time analysis has been experimentally used for the diagnosis of [[heart failure]] syndrome<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> as well as identifying patients at high risk for [[sudden cardiac death]],<ref name=\":10\" /> even when measuring solely the heart rate, either using [[electrocardiography]] or far more inexpensive and portable equipment (i.e. [[Pulse oximeter|oximeter]]).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Economy ===\nDue to similarities of the dynamic characteristics between earthquakes and financial markets, natural time analysis, which is primirily used in seismology, was chosen to assist in developing winning strategies in financial markets, with encouraging results.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n*{{Cite book\n |last1 = Varotsos |first1 = Panayiotis A.\n |last2 = Sarlis   |first2 = Nicholas V.\n |last3 = Skordas  |first3 = Efthimios S.\n |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/755081829\n |title=Natural time analysis : the new view of time ; Precursory seismic electric signals, earthquakes and other complex time series\n |date=2011\n |publisher=Springer\n |isbn=978-3-642-16449-1\n |location=Berlin\n |oclc=755081829\n}}\n\n[[Category:Statistical analysis]]\n", "text_old": "'''Natural time analysis''' is a [[Statistics|statistical method]] applied to analyze [[Complexity|complex time series]] and [[critical phenomena]], based on event counts as a measure of \"time\" rather than the [[Time|clock time]].<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Varotsos|first=P.

A related term, {{math|''p''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, is the ratio {{math|''Q''<sub>''k''</sub> ''/'' ''Q''<sub>''total''</sub>}}, which describes the fractional energy released. The term {{math|&kappa;<sub>1</sub>}} is the variance in natural time:<ref>Varotsos, Sarlis & Skordas 2011 (book), pages 121 & 131</ref>\n\n: <math>\\kappa_1=\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k(\\chi_k)^2 - \\bigl(\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k\\chi_k\\bigr)^2</math>\n\n: where <math>\\textstyle\\chi_k=k/N</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\ p_k=\\frac{Q_k}{\\sum_{n=1}^N Q_n}</math>\n\n== Time reversal ==\nTime reversal, in contrast to clock time, is applicable when studying the approach of a system to criticality with natural time analysis.

While time irreversibility is a fundamental property of a living system, the state of death is more time reversible by means of energy flow across the system's boundaries. Thus a critical state of a system can be estimated by applying natural time analysis upon calculating the [[entropy]] upon both normal time flow and time reversal and studying the difference of the two results.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":0\" />[[File:Natural time as applied in cardiology.jpg|thumb|(a) [[Electrocardiography|ECG]] in which the RR distances are marked<br />\n(b) the same ECG plotted in (a) but read in natural time analysis<br />\n(c) ECG at conventional time upon time reversal<br />\n(d) ECG upon time reversal in natural time analysis<br />\nThe length between RR distances in conventional time is aproximately considered as the energy of each pulse (event) in natural time analysis.|400px|alt=|center]]\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Seismology ===\n\n==== Earthquake nowcasting ====\nIn [[seismology]], nowcasting is the estimate of the current dynamic state of a seismological system.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> It differs from forecasting which aims to estimate the probability of a future event<ref name=\":5\" /> but it is also considered a potential base for forecasting.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Nowcasting is based on the [[earthquake cycle]] model, a recurring cycle between pairs of large earthquakes in a geographical area, upon which the system is evaluated using natural time analysis.<ref name=\":1\" /> Nowcasting calculations produce the \"earthquake potential score\", an estimation of the current level of seismic progress.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhen applied to seismicity, natural time analysis has the following advantages:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n# Declustering of the aftershocks is not necessary as natural time count is evenly valid in any case of aftershock or backgroung seismicity.\n# Natural time statistics do not depend on the level of seismicity, given that the [[Gutenberg\u2013Richter law|b value]] does not significantly vary.\n\nTypical applications are: great global earthquakes and [[Tsunami|tsunamis]],<ref name=\":6\" /> aftershocks and [[induced seismicity]],<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> induced seismicity at [[Gas field|gas fields]],<ref name=\":7\" /> seismic risk to global megacities,<ref name=\":5\" /> studying of [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] of large global earthquakes,<ref name=\":8\" /> etc.\n\n==== Earthquake prediction ====\nNatural time analysis has been initially applied to [[VAN method]] in order to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the time of a forthcoming earthquake that has been indicated to occur by seismic eletric signals (SES).

{"title_page": "Persecutions of the Catholic Church and Pius XII", "text_new": "{{Main article|Pope Pius XII}}\n{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]] took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two|World War II]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions \u2013 notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive, or resist or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]], persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216</ref> Bullock wrote: Hitler thought that Catholic teachings, taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218</ref> Bullock adds that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>\n\n{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church.

Smuggled into Germany to avoid prior censorship and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it condemned Nazi ideology<ref>Frattini, p. 230</ref> as \"insane and arrogant\".

The [[Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands#Old Catholic Archbishops of Utrecht|Archbishop of Utrecht]] and other Catholics refused to comply, and the Nazis commenced a round up of all ethnically Jewish Catholics. Some 40,000 Jews were hidden by the Dutch church and 49 priests killed in the process.<ref name=\"catholiceducation.org\"/> Among the Catholics of the Netherlands abducted in this way was Saint [[Edith Stein]], who died at Auschwitz.\n\n===Japanese persecutions===\n{{expand section|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe expansion of Imperial Japan across the Asia Pacific from 1941 was accompanied by [[Japanese war crimes|many atrocities]] against Catholic missionaries, clerics, nuns, and lay people. Imperial Japan had developed [[State Shinto]] as the Imperial religion and promoted the notion of the [[Arahitogami|divinity of the Emperor]].

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref> In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.

Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however. In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis|''Ad Apostolorum Principis'']] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]]; to the Vatican it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within months of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943. The Papal degree changed the [[ecclesiastical]] situation in China in an almost revolutionary way.<ref>Smit 188</ref> As the Church began to flourish, [[Pius XII]] established a local ecclesiastical hierarchy and received the Archbishop of Peking, [[Thomas Tien Ken-sin]], SVD, into the Sacred [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>Smit 188.</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, about four million Chinese were members of the Catholic faith. This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed. Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church had operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81,628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref> Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs to earn their living. Foreign missionaries were accused of being foreign agents who would turn the country over to imperialist forces.<ref>Giovanetti 232</ref>\n\n====Soviet Union====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Russia}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lemko church.jpg|thumb|The Shelesto St Michael's wooden church (1777) is a classic example of Ruthenian architecture.]] -->\n\nRelations between Soviet authorities and the Vatican were always difficult.

[[Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements<ref>AAS 29, 1937, 67</ref> and the encyclicals ''[[Miserentissimus Redemptor]],<ref>AAS 20 1928 165\u2013178</ref> Caritate Christi,<ref>AAS 24 1932 177\u2013194</ref> and [[Divini Redemptoris]]''.<ref>AAS 29, 1937 65\u2013106</ref> The pontificate of Pius XII from the very beginning faced problems, as large parts of Poland, the [[Baltic States]], and their Catholic populations were incorporated into the [[USSR]]. At once, the United Catholic Churches of [[Armenia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Ruthenia]] were attacked.\n\n==== Catholic Ruthenian and Ukrainian Churches ====\nSoviet attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome reflected not only Soviet policy, but were a continuation of centuries-old Russian policies towards the papacy, already viewed as [[anti-Russian]].<ref>see main article, Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII</ref> Pius also was aware that, in months preceding the [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested, including [[Josyf Slipyj]], [[Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, Josaphat Kocylovskyi]]. Some, including Bishop Nicetas Budka, perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref> Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.\n\nWith the Catholic Church robbed of its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. [[Mass arrest]]s of priests followed. In [[Lemko]], some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref> Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries were closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi, 517</ref> Catholic United Churches were integrated under the [[Moscow Patriarchy]] after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested.<ref>Adrianyi, 518</ref> The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"[[peaceful coexistence]]\" became the subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for it. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical [[cooperation]] whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de[[-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] thwarted major results aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed the willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican, in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which was called identical with [[Kremlin]] policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref>\n\n==== Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia ====\nThe small Catholic churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945. All Church organizations were outlawed and all bishops jailed.<ref>Adrianyi, 514.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Pope Pius received the ambassador of [[Lithuania]] for a final meeting prior to the Soviet occupation. At the outbreak of World War II there were 800 parishes, 1500 priests, and 600 candidates for the priesthood in four seminaries in Lithuania. As a part of the Soviet crackdown, the complete hierarchy, a large part of the clergy and about a third of the Catholic population was deported.<ref>Adrianyi, 515</ref>\n\n==== Poland ====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Poland}}\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan Cardinal Wyszy\u0144ski was arrested from 1953 to 1956]]\n\nWith the war over, the Pope discontinued his war-time policy of neutrality, stating that he had abstained from protests during the war in spite of massive persecutions.<ref>Giovannetti, 139</ref> The Communist Party of Poland assumed governmental control in 1947, and began to confiscate Church properties in the months thereafter. By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, and orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy. Pope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter ''Flagranti Semper Animi'',<ref>January 18, 1948, AAS 1948, 324</ref> in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations. Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, [[Decennium Dum Expletur]]. He writes that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, the suffering continues ten years afterwards. [[Cum Jam Lustri|''Cum Jam Lustri'']] commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha, and encourages the Church in Poland. In honour of [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w|Saint Stanis\u0142aw]], Pope Pius XII issued [[Poloniae Annalibus|''Poloniae Annalibus'']], giving consolation and again expressing his certitude that Christ will win and the persecution will end. By 1952 some 1000 priests were incarcerated, all seminaries closed, and [[religious institute]]s dissolved.<ref>Giovannetti, 150</ref> On 19 November 1953 the pontiff addressed the [[Diplomatic Corps|diplomatic corps]] to issue a protest against the incarceration of Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszynski]].<ref>AAS, 1953, 755</ref> After the arrest of the cardinal, authorities supported patriotic priests who were open to separation from Rome. At the 300th anniversary of the successful defence of [[Jasna G\u00f3ra]], Pope Pius XII wrote again to Poland, congratulating the courageous defenders of the faith in his time. [[Gloriosam Reginam|''Gloriosam Reginam'']] salutes the modern day Polish martyrs and expresses confidence in victory for Mary, Queen of Poland. He salutes Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski upon his return from arrest in October 1956.\n\nWith ''[[Invicti athletae]] i''n 1957, Pope Pius addressed in strong words the Polish episcopate for the 300th. anniversary of the martyrdom of [[Saint]] [[Andrew Bobola]] by the Russians: \"The haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and his Church.\" The Pope counselled endurance and bravery. The people and clergy must overcome many obstacles, with sacrifices of time and money, but they must never give in.<ref>''Invicti athletae'', 29 in AAS 1957, 321 ff</ref> The Pope urges his bishops in Poland not to be overwhelmed by the situation but to mix [[courage]] with [[prudence]], and [[knowledge]] with [[wisdom]]: \"Act boldly, but with that Christian promptness of soul which goes hand in hand with prudence, knowledge, and wisdom.

After its [[Czech coup|Communist coup in 1948]], Czechoslovakia expelled the [[Papal]] [[Nuncio]] and closed Catholic seminaries for the formation of priests. [[Prague]] outlawed all religious institutes and Catholic associations and gradually suppressed the Catholic press.<ref>Adrianyi, 525</ref> Attempts were made to divide the clergy into opposing camps by creating a government-controlled association of priests headed by Bishop [[Joseph Plojhar]]. Archbishop [[Josef Beran]] and others refused to participate and were subjected to public [[show trial]]s and long incarcerations. In 1949, the governmental \"Church Office\" took complete control of the Catholic Church.\n\n==== Hungary ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CardinalMindszenty.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Cardinal Mindszenty, New Brunswick, NJ]] -->\nAfter the occupation of Hungary by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, [[socialist]] policies gained ground only gradually in the country. But in the following five years, the Church lost 3.300 [[schools]], numerous [[hospitals]], and [[newspapers]], while 11.500 [[religious]] were asked to leave their convents, monasteries, and institutes.<ref>Adrianyi, 528.</ref> The [[nuncio]] was expelled already in 1945. The Church attempted to come to agreement with the government in 1950, when the continuation of about ten Catholic schools was permitted. The overwhelming experience of Hungarian Catholicism was the public show trials and degradations of Archbishop [[Jozsef Grosz]] and Cardinal [[Jozsef Mindszenty]], which led to a complete exclusion of the Church from all public life and Hungarian society.<ref>Adrianyi 529</ref>\n\n===== Jozsef Mindszenty =====\n[[Jozsef Mindszenty]] had been jailed by the [[Germany|Germans]], freed by the Soviet army, and was ordained [[Bishop]] in 1944. After the communist party coup in Hungary, a reign of [[state terrorism|terror]] backed by the Soviet army was instituted<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> Pope Pius XII named Mindzenty [[Primate of Hungary]] and admitted him to the [[College of Cardinals]] in 1946. \"After a propaganda campaign, he was arrested on charges of collaboration with the Nazis, spying, treason, and [[currency]] [[fraud]]. None of the accusations were true. He was [[torture]]d mentally and physically and beaten daily with rubber truncheons until he signed a [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. His show trial was condemned by the [[United Nations]].   \"The trumped up proceedings, fully reported in the West, gripped and horrified Catholics the world over.\"<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> The Cardinal remained in prison until 1956 when he was freed. during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]]. After the failure of the revolution, he lived in the American embassy for the following 15 years.\n\n==== Romania, Bulgaria and Albania ====\n[[File:Blaj s3.jpg|thumb|Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n[[File:Blaj s2.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n\nAfter World War I, Romania inherited large parts of Catholic Hungary including large Catholic populations, which were not always treated well between the wars.<ref>Adryani 530</ref> The [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Solemmni Conventione'' of 1930 includes a [[concordat]] between Romania and the Vatican.<ref>AAS 1930, 381</ref> It allowed for four dioceses and free exercise of religion within the country. Because of rival interpretations the concordat was enacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, the others were considered non-existent.<ref>Adrianyi,531</ref> The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed, Catholic activities were outlawed.<ref>Adrianyi,532.</ref><ref>''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.</ref>\n\nBulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,<ref>Adrianyi, 536</ref> many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppression|oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled. Domestic bishops, priests and religious were killed, jailed or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929,  [[Muslim]]s in 1931, [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican. After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref> The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other socialist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated among them 139 Franciscan friar, 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy. A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\", this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times. The Pope explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref> Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome, and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him. After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15500 priests, religious and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\"<ref>Dammertz 376</ref> The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"Untermenschen\", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan friar [[Maximilian Kolbe]].\n[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]\nIn the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger.

Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]] took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two|World War II]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions \u2013 notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive, or resist or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]], persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216</ref> Bullock wrote: Hitler thought that Catholic teachings, taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218</ref> Bullock adds that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>\n\n{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church.

Smuggled into Germany to avoid prior censorship and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it condemned Nazi ideology<ref>Frattini, p. 230</ref> as \"insane and arrogant\". It denounced the Nazi myth of \"blood and soil\", decried neopaganism of Nazism, its war of annihilation against the Church, and described the F\u00fchrer as a \"mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance\".

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref> In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.

Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however. In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis|''Ad Apostolorum Principis'']] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]]; to the Vatican it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within months of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943. The Papal degree changed the [[ecclesiastical]] situation in China in an almost revolutionary way.<ref>Smit 188</ref> As the Church began to flourish, [[Pius XII]] established a local ecclesiastical hierarchy and received the Archbishop of Peking, [[Thomas Tien Ken-sin]], SVD, into the Sacred [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>Smit 188.</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, about four million Chinese were members of the Catholic faith. This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed. Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church had operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81,628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref> Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs to earn their living. Foreign missionaries were accused of being foreign agents who would turn the country over to imperialist forces.<ref>Giovanetti 232</ref>\n\n====Soviet Union====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Russia}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lemko church.jpg|thumb|The Shelesto St Michael's wooden church (1777) is a classic example of Ruthenian architecture.]] -->\n\nRelations between Soviet authorities and the Vatican were always difficult.

[[Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements<ref>AAS 29, 1937, 67</ref> and the encyclicals ''[[Miserentissimus Redemptor]],<ref>AAS 20 1928 165\u2013178</ref> Caritate Christi,<ref>AAS 24 1932 177\u2013194</ref> and [[Divini Redemptoris]]''.<ref>AAS 29, 1937 65\u2013106</ref> The pontificate of Pius XII from the very beginning faced problems, as large parts of Poland, the [[Baltic States]], and their Catholic populations were incorporated into the [[USSR]]. At once, the United Catholic Churches of [[Armenia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Ruthenia]] were attacked.\n\n==== Catholic Ruthenian and Ukrainian Churches ====\nSoviet attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome reflected not only Soviet policy, but were a continuation of centuries-old Russian policies towards the papacy, already viewed as [[anti-Russian]].<ref>see main article, Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII</ref> Pius also was aware that, in months preceding the [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested, including [[Josyf Slipyj]], [[Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, Josaphat Kocylovskyi]]. Some, including Bishop Nicetas Budka, perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref> Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.\n\nWith the Catholic Church robbed of its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. [[Mass arrest]]s of priests followed. In [[Lemko]], some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref> Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries were closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi, 517</ref> Catholic United Churches were integrated under the [[Moscow Patriarchy]] after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested.<ref>Adrianyi, 518</ref> The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"[[peaceful coexistence]]\" became the subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for it. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical [[cooperation]] whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de[[-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] thwarted major results aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed the willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican, in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which was called identical with [[Kremlin]] policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref>\n\n==== Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia ====\nThe small Catholic churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945. All Church organizations were outlawed and all bishops jailed.<ref>Adrianyi, 514.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Pope Pius received the ambassador of [[Lithuania]] for a final meeting prior to the Soviet occupation. At the outbreak of World War II there were 800 parishes, 1500 priests, and 600 candidates for the priesthood in four seminaries in Lithuania. As a part of the Soviet crackdown, the complete hierarchy, a large part of the clergy and about a third of the Catholic population was deported.<ref>Adrianyi, 515</ref>\n\n==== Poland ====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Poland}}\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan Cardinal Wyszy\u0144ski was arrested from 1953 to 1956]]\n\nWith the war over, the Pope discontinued his war-time policy of neutrality, stating that he had abstained from protests during the war in spite of massive persecutions.<ref>Giovannetti, 139</ref> The Communist Party of Poland assumed governmental control in 1947, and began to confiscate Church properties in the months thereafter. By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, and orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy. Pope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter ''Flagranti Semper Animi'',<ref>January 18, 1948, AAS 1948, 324</ref> in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations. Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, [[Decennium Dum Expletur]]. He writes that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, the suffering continues ten years afterwards. [[Cum Jam Lustri|''Cum Jam Lustri'']] commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha, and encourages the Church in Poland. In honour of [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w|Saint Stanis\u0142aw]], Pope Pius XII issued [[Poloniae Annalibus|''Poloniae Annalibus'']], giving consolation and again expressing his certitude that Christ will win and the persecution will end. By 1952 some 1000 priests were incarcerated, all seminaries closed, and [[religious institute]]s dissolved.<ref>Giovannetti, 150</ref> On 19 November 1953 the pontiff addressed the [[Diplomatic Corps|diplomatic corps]] to issue a protest against the incarceration of Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszynski]].<ref>AAS, 1953, 755</ref> After the arrest of the cardinal, authorities supported patriotic priests who were open to separation from Rome. At the 300th anniversary of the successful defence of [[Jasna G\u00f3ra]], Pope Pius XII wrote again to Poland, congratulating the courageous defenders of the faith in his time. [[Gloriosam Reginam|''Gloriosam Reginam'']] salutes the modern day Polish martyrs and expresses confidence in victory for Mary, Queen of Poland. He salutes Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski upon his return from arrest in October 1956.\n\nWith ''[[Invicti athletae]] i''n 1957, Pope Pius addressed in strong words the Polish episcopate for the 300th. anniversary of the martyrdom of [[Saint]] [[Andrew Bobola]] by the Russians: \"The haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and his Church.\" The Pope counselled endurance and bravery. The people and clergy must overcome many obstacles, with sacrifices of time and money, but they must never give in.<ref>''Invicti athletae'', 29 in AAS 1957, 321 ff</ref> The Pope urges his bishops in Poland not to be overwhelmed by the situation but to mix [[courage]] with [[prudence]], and [[knowledge]] with [[wisdom]]: \"Act boldly, but with that Christian promptness of soul which goes hand in hand with prudence, knowledge, and wisdom. Keep Catholic faith and unity.\"<ref>''Invicti athletae'', 34,  in AAS 1957, 321</ref>\n==== Czechoslovakia ====\n\"They can take away your freedom, but they cannot tear the Catholic faith from your hearts. They can turn you into martyrs, but they can never turn you into traitors.\"<ref>AAS, XXXVII, 1945, 252</ref> In 1945, the [[Czechoslovakian]] government expelled its [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] and [[Germans|German]] populations from Czechoslovakian territories, thus greatly reducing the percentage of [[Catholics]] in the country. After its [[Czech coup|Communist coup in 1948]], Czechoslovakia expelled the [[Papal]] [[Nuncio]] and closed Catholic seminaries for the formation of priests. [[Prague]] outlawed all religious institutes and Catholic associations and gradually suppressed the Catholic press.<ref>Adrianyi, 525</ref> Attempts were made to divide the clergy into opposing camps by creating a government-controlled association of priests headed by Bishop [[Joseph Plojhar]]. Archbishop [[Josef Beran]] and others refused to participate and were subjected to public [[show trial]]s and long incarcerations. In 1949, the governmental \"Church Office\" took complete control of the Catholic Church.\n\n==== Hungary ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CardinalMindszenty.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Cardinal Mindszenty, New Brunswick, NJ]] -->\nAfter the occupation of Hungary by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, [[socialist]] policies gained only gradually ground in the country. But in the following five years, the Church lost three thousand and three-hundred [[schools]], numerous [[hospitals]] and [[newspapers]]. 11.500 [[Religious]] were asked to leave their convents and monasteries and institutes.<ref>Adrianyi, 528.</ref> The [[nuncio]] was expelled already in 1945. The Church attempted to come to agreements with the government in 1950, when the continuation of about ten Catholic schools was permitted. The overwhelming experience of Hungarian Catholicism were the public show trials and degradations of Archbishop [[Jozsef Grosz]] and Cardinal [[Jozsef Mindszenty]]. They resulted in a complete exclusion of the Church from all public life and Hungarian society.<ref>Adrianyi 529</ref>\n\n===== Jozsef Mindszenty =====\n[[Jozsef Mindszenty]] had been jailed by the [[Germany|Germans]], freed by the Soviet army and was ordained [[Bishop]] in 1944. After coup of the communist party in Hungary, a reign of [[state terrorism|terror]] backed by the Soviet army was instituted<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/>\nPope Pius XII named Mindzenty [[Primate of Hungary]] and received him in the [[College of Cardinals]] in 1946. \"After a propaganda campaign, he was arrested on charges of collaboration with the Nazis, spying, treason, and [[currency]] [[fraud]]. None of the accusations were true. He was [[torture]]d, mentally and physically, beaten daily with rubber truncheons until he signed a [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. His show trial was condemned by the [[United Nations]]... The trumped up proceedings, fully reported in the West, gripped and horrified Catholics the world over.\"<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> The Cardinal remained in prison until 1956, when, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] he was freed. After the failure of the revolution, he lived in the American embassy for the following 15 years.\n\n==== Romania, Bulgaria and Albania ====\n[[File:Blaj s3.jpg|thumb|Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n[[File:Blaj s2.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n\nAfter World War I, Romania inherited large parts of Catholic Hungary including large Catholic populations, which were not always treated well between the wars.<ref>Adryani 530</ref> The [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Solemmni Conventione'' of 1930 includes a [[concordat]] between Romania and the Vatican.<ref>AAS 1930, 381</ref> It allowed for four dioceses and free exercise of religion within the country. Because of rival interpretations the concordat was enacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, the others were considered non-existent.<ref>Adrianyi,531</ref> The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed, Catholic activities were outlawed.<ref>Adrianyi,532.</ref><ref>''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.</ref>\n\nBulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,<ref>Adrianyi, 536</ref> many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppression|oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled. Domestic bishops, priests and religious were killed, jailed or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929,  [[Muslim]]s in 1931, [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican. After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref> The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other socialist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated among them 139 Franciscan friar, 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy. A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\", this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times. The Pope explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref> Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome, and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him. After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15500 priests, religious and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\"<ref>Dammertz 376</ref> The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"Untermenschen\", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan friar [[Maximilian Kolbe]].\n[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]\nIn the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger. Between April and October 1942, 500 Polish religious died in Dachau, in part due to mistreatment, hunger or the gas chambers.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\">HK 1960, 27</ref> Long-time inmate Bishop Kozlowiecki reports: \"What a happy day, if I was beaten only once or twice\". Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\"/> Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors, which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.<ref>Pio XII, Discorsi VII, 1945,  Roma, Vaticano, 74</ref>\n\nAfter 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions, their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\nIn all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions. All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well. In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950.<ref>Dammertz 377</ref> In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months. Some 300 were permitted to remain.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> The Hungarian hierarchy entered an agreement with the authorities, which permitted the reopening of eight Catholic schools<ref>Galter, 345\u2013353,</ref><ref>Herder Korrespondenz, 5, 1950, 33</ref>\n\nIn [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], all orders were closed after the war and properties confiscated. In [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate. In China and [[North Korea]] Catholic religious no longer existed. Foreign missionaries were expelled, the fate of most local religious is unknown.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\n== Decrees of the Holy Office on Communism ==\n{{Main article|Decree against Communism}}\nThe Vatican, having been silent during the war on communist excesses, displayed a harder line on communism after 1945.\n\n== Encyclicals of Pope Pius XII on Church persecutions ==\nThe name of a Papal Encyclical is always taken from its [[incipit|first two or three words]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| No.\n! colspan=2| Title\n! rowspan=2| Subject\n! rowspan=2| Date\n! rowspan=2| Text\n|-\n!

It may have been named after [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Earl of Effingham]], who resigned his commission as general in the British army in 1775, refusing to serve in the war against the Colonies. The name is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] for \"Effa's house\".  New information suggests that the county was named after a surveyor who surveyed the area whose last name was Effingham.  There is no written proof that the county was named after Lord Effingham.\n<gallery>\nFile:Effingham County Illinois 1831.png|Effingham County at the time of its creation in 1831\n</gallery>\n[[Image:EffinghamCountyCourthouse EffinghamIL.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Effingham County Courthouse in [[Effingham, Illinois|Effingham]]]]\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|480|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|479|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1.2|sqmi}} (0.3%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\nJust west of [[Effingham, Illinois|Effingham]] on [[Interstate 70]] there is a {{convert|198|ft|adj=on}} white [[Christian cross|cross]]; 35,000 vehicles are estimated to pass the site each day.

Until [[Woodrow Wilson]]\u2019s harsh policies towards Germany following [[World War I]] drove many voters to the GOP\u2019s [[Warren G. Harding]], it had voted an absolute majority to the Democratic presidential candidate in every election since the county\u2019s formation. Opposition to the [[New Deal]] caused a considerable swing away from [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1936, and combined with local opposition to Roosevelt\u2019s war policies in 1940 to cause FDR to only win the county by forty-seven votes from [[Wendell Willkie]].\n\nSince that election, the county has voted Republican in every election except 1948 and 1964, and no Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976 has reached 35 percent of the county\u2019s vote. Currently Effingham County is one of Illinois\u2019 most Republican counties, rivalled by a number of southern counties like [[Edwards County, Illinois|Edwards]]. In the [[United States presidential election in Illinois, 2008|2008 U.S. Presidential election]], [[John McCain]] carried the county by a 36% margin over [[Barack Obama]], making it McCain's strongest county in the state, with Obama carrying his home state by a 25.1% margin over McCain.<ref>[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ U.S. Election Atlas]</ref>\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Until [[Woodrow Wilson]]\u2019s harsh policies towards Germany following [[World War I]] drove many voters to the GOP\u2019s [[Warren G. Harding]], it had voted an absolute majority to the Democratic presidential candidate in every election since the county\u2019s formation. Opposition to the [[New Deal]] caused a considerable swing away from [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1936, and combined with local opposition to Roosevelt\u2019s war policies in 1940 to cause FDR to only win the county by forty-seven votes from [[Wendell Willkie]].\n\nSince that election, the county has voted Republican in every election except 1948 and 1964, and no Democrat since Jimmy Carter in 1976 has reached 35 percent of the county\u2019s vote.

He joined the national Urdu daily of Pakistan, ''[[Nawaiwaqt]]'' in May 2007 and currently still writes as a columnist.

Typically, his works address the [[Great Depression]], [[World War II]], and the impact of technology and politics on individuals and their surroundings. Landau's works can be found in the permanent collections of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Library of Congress]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]], and the [[National Gallery]].\n\n==Biography==\nLandau was born December 17, 1917, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the age of three he began drawing everything around him. When he was 12, he began studying at the Graphic Sketch Club, now the [[Samuel Fleisher Memorial]]. At the age of 17, Landau\u2019s illustrations for Kipling\u2019s ''[[Jungle Book]]'' won a competition in ''Scholastic Magazine''. He won the competition the following year as well. In 1935, Landau received a scholarship from the Museum School of Industrial Art (today the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]) to study illustration, printmaking and painting.<ref name=\"Stein\">{{cite web|last=Stein|first=Judith|title=Jacob Landau: Old Man Mad About Drawing|url=http://judithestein.com/jacob-landau-old-man-mad-about-drawing|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}</ref> After his graduation in 1939,  Landau moved to [[New York City]] where he experimented with a variety of styles, treatments and media. His first phase as a professional artist included illustrating books and magazines.\n\nIn 1943, Landau was drafted into the armed forces, serving two years overseas in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean Theater]]. In the army, Landau served in a number of capacities which utilized his artistic talents. His service in Italy included work as the art editor, photographer, and reporter of ''[[At Ease]]'', a special services magazine. After his discharge in 1946, Landau used the [[G.I. Bill]] to further study art.\n\nLandau spent a year (1948-1949) at New York's [[New School for Social Research]] before moving to Paris with his wife, Frances, and young son to study at the [[Academie Julian]] and the [[Academie de la Grande Chaumiere]]. While in Paris, Landau met printmaker [[Leonard Baskin]], who taught him the medium of woodcuts.<ref name=Stein />\n\nFrom 1954-1957 Landau taught at the [[Philadelphia College of Art]] before moving to [[Pratt Institute]] where he would teach for over 20 years. During his time at Pratt, Landau helped to establish the University Without Walls program, in which students worked closely with instructors to gain hands-on experience. In 1975, Landau became a faculty member of the [[Artist Teacher Institute]], a 10-day summer residency program sponsored by the [[New Jersey State Council on the Arts]].\n\nIn addition to his art and teaching, Landau was very involved in the community. He was active in many different organizations including: Alliance for Arts Education, [[American Humanist Association]], Association for Humanistic Psychology, Coalition for Nuclear Disarmament, International Arts Association, [[Jewish Federation]], Linkage Project, New Jersey School for the Arts, Printmaking Council, and World Futures Society. In 1974 he was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1979.\n\nLandau and his wife Frances lived in [[Roosevelt, New Jersey]] as part of a small community of artists. There he built a [[geodesic dome]] which was created as an art studio. His wife died in 1993 of [[Alzheimer's Disease]]. They had two sons, Jonas and Stefan.\n\nJacob Landau died on November 24, 2001, at the age of 85, and is buried in the Roosevelt Cemetery near his friends [[Ben Shahn]] and [[Gregorio Prestopino]].<ref name=Obit>{{cite web|last=Denicola|first=Linda|title=Artist Jacob Landau Gone, but his work survives|url=http://tri.gmnews.com/news/2002-01-10/Front_page/010.html|publisher=Tri-Town News|accessdate=May 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913000139/http://tri.gmnews.com/news/2002-01-10/Front_Page/010.html|archive-date=September 13, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>  After his death, the Jacob Landau Institute was formed to preserve his legacy, share his unique philosophy of education, and nurture individual artists.<ref name=Institute />\n\n==Artwork==\nLandau's art communicates his consciousness of humankind's predicament, its beauty and its horror.<ref name=Yarosh>{{cite web|title=James Yarosh Gallery|url=http://jamesyarosh.com/jacob070409_2.html|accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> Growing up during the [[Great Depression]] and having been profoundly affected by [[The Holocaust]], Landau's work expresses the self-inflicted human turmoil of the 20th century.

Typically, his works address the [[Great Depression]], [[World War II]], and the impact of technology and politics on individuals and their surroundings. Landau's works can be found in the permanent collections of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Library of Congress]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]], and the [[National Gallery]].\n\n==Biography==\nLandau was born December 17, 1917, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the age of three he began drawing everything around him. When he was 12, he began studying at the Graphic Sketch Club, now the [[Samuel Fleisher Memorial]]. At the age of 17, Landau\u2019s illustrations for Kipling\u2019s ''[[Jungle Book]]'' won a competition in ''Scholastic Magazine''. He won the competition the following year as well. In 1935, Landau received a scholarship from the Museum School of Industrial Art (today the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]) to study illustration, printmaking and painting.<ref name=\"Stein\">{{cite web|last=Stein|first=Judith|title=Jacob Landau: Old Man Mad About Drawing|url=http://judithestein.com/jacob-landau-old-man-mad-about-drawing|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}</ref> After his graduation in 1939,  Landau moved to [[New York City]] where he experimented with a variety of styles, treatments and media. His first phase as a professional artist included illustrating books and magazines.\n\nIn 1943, Landau was drafted into the armed forces, serving two years overseas in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean Theater]]. In the army, Landau served in a number of capacities which utilized his artistic talents. His service in Italy included work as the art editor, photographer, and reporter of ''[[At Ease]]'', a special services magazine. After his discharge in 1946, Landau used the [[G.I. Bill]] to further study art.\n\nLandau spent a year (1948-1949) at New York's [[New School for Social Research]] before moving to Paris with his wife, Frances, and young son to study at the [[Academie Julian]] and the [[Academie de la Grande Chaumiere]]. While in Paris, Landau met printmaker [[Leonard Baskin]], who taught him the medium of woodcuts.<ref name=Stein />\n\nFrom 1954-1957 Landau taught at the [[Philadelphia College of Art]] before moving to [[Pratt Institute]] where he would teach for over 20 years. During his time at Pratt, Landau helped to establish the University Without Walls program, in which students worked closely with instructors to gain hands-on experience. In 1975, Landau became a faculty member of the [[Artist Teacher Institute]], a 10-day summer residency program sponsored by the [[New Jersey State Council on the Arts]].\n\nIn addition to his art and teaching, Landau was very involved in the community. He was active in many different organizations including: Alliance for Arts Education, [[American Humanist Association]], Association for Humanistic Psychology, Coalition for Nuclear Disarmament, International Arts Association, [[Jewish Federation]], Linkage Project, New Jersey School for the Arts, Printmaking Council, and World Futures Society. In 1974 he was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1979.\n\nLandau and his wife Frances lived in [[Roosevelt, New Jersey]] as part of a small community of artists. There he built a [[geodesic dome]] which was created as an art studio. His wife died in 1993 of [[Alzheimer's Disease]]. They had two sons, Jonas and Stefan.\n\nJacob Landau died on November 24, 2001, at the age of 85, and is buried in the Roosevelt Cemetery near his friends [[Ben Shahn]] and [[Gregorio Prestopino]].<ref name=Obit>{{cite web|last=Denicola|first=Linda|title=Artist Jacob Landau Gone, but his work survives|url=http://tri.gmnews.com/news/2002-01-10/Front_page/010.html|publisher=Tri-Town News|accessdate=May 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913000139/http://tri.gmnews.com/news/2002-01-10/Front_Page/010.html|archive-date=September 13, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>  After his death, the Jacob Landau Institute was formed to preserve his legacy, share his unique philosophy of education, and nurture individual artists.<ref name=Institute />\n\n==Artwork==\nLandau's art communicates his consciousness of humankind's predicament, its beauty and its horror.<ref name=Yarosh>{{cite web|title=James Yarosh Gallery|url=http://jamesyarosh.com/jacob070409_2.html|accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> Growing up during the [[Great Depression]] and having been profoundly affected by [[The Holocaust]], Landau's work expresses the self-inflicted human turmoil of the 20th century.
