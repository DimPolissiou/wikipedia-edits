Born in [[Chislehurst]], England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began [[Zen]] training in New York. He received a master's degree in [[theology]] from [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]] and became an [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] priest in 1945. He left the ministry in 1950 and moved to [[California]], where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]].<ref>James Craig Holte ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kWJoPT3zBK0C&pg=PA199&dq=Alan+Watts+american+citizen&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DGAiUfOLHZCoqQGtkYDwBQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Alan%20Watts%20american%20citizen&f=false The Conversion Experience in America: A 'Sourcebook on American Religious Conversion Autobiography]'' page 199</ref>\n\nWatts gained a following while working as a volunteer programmer at the [[KPFA]] radio station in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. He wrote more than 25 books and articles on religion and philosophy, introducing the emerging [[Counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] to ''[[The Way of Zen]]'' (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism. In ''Psychotherapy East and West'' (1961), he argued that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of [[psychotherapy]]. He considered ''Nature, Man and Woman'' (1958) to be, \"from a literary point of view\u2014the best book I have ever written.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |year=1973 |title=In My Own Way: An Autobiography 1915\u20131965 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York |page=280}}</ref> He also explored human consciousness and [[psychedelic]]s in works such as \"The New Alchemy\" (1958) and ''The Joyous Cosmology'' (1962).\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Alan Watts age7.JPG|thumb|upright|Watts aged 7]]\n\nWatts was born to middle-class parents in the village of [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]] (now south-east London), on 6 January 1915, living at 3 (now 5) Holbrook Lane, which was previously lived in by author [[John Hemming-Clark]] in the early 1900s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.johnhemmingclark.com/media|title=Media}}</ref> Watts' father, Laurence Wilson Watts, was a representative for the London office of the [[Michelin]] tyre company. His mother, Emily Mary Watts (n\u00e9e Buchan), was a housewife whose father had been a [[missionary]]. With modest financial means, they chose to live in pastoral surroundings and Watts, an only child, grew up playing at Brookside, learning the names of wildflowers and butterflies.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, Part 1</ref> Probably because of the influence of his mother's religious family<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 12.</ref> the Buchans, an interest in \"ultimate things\" seeped in. It mixed with Watts's own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East.<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 22</ref>\n\nWatts also later wrote of a [[mystical]] dream he experienced while ill with a fever as a child.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 322</ref> During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote \"I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float...\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> These works of art emphasised the participatory relationship of people in nature, a theme that stood fast throughout his life and one that he often wrote about. (See, for instance, the last chapter in ''[[The Way of Zen]]''.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1957, Part 2, Chapter 4</ref>)\n\n===Buddhism===\n\nBy his own assessment, Watts was imaginative, headstrong, and talkative. He was sent to [[boarding school]]s (which included both academic and religious training of the \"[[Muscular Christianity|Muscular Christian]]\" sort) from early years. Of this religious training, he remarked \"Throughout my schooling my religious indoctrination was grim and maudlin.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 60</ref>\n\nWatts spent several holidays in [[France]] in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] with strong interests in both [[Buddhism]] and exotic little-known aspects of European culture. It was not long afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the [[Anglican]] Christianity he had been exposed to and the Buddhism he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw's. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the [[London Buddhist Lodge]], which had been established by [[Theosophism|Theosophists]], and was then run by the barrister [[Christmas Humphreys]]. Watts became the organization's secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of [[meditation]] during these years.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Education===\n\nWatts attended [[The King's School, Canterbury]], next door to [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Though he was frequently at the top of his classes scholastically and was given responsibilities at school, he botched an opportunity for a [[scholarship]] to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] by styling a crucial examination essay in a way that was read as \"presumptuous and capricious.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 102</ref>\n\nWhen he left secondary school, Watts worked in a printing house and later a bank. He spent his spare time involved with the [[Buddhist Society|Buddhist Lodge]] and also under the tutelage of a \"rascal guru\" named [[Dimitrije Mitrinovi\u0107]]. (Mitrinovi\u0107 was himself influenced by [[P. D. Ouspensky|Peter Demianovich Ouspensky]], [[George Gurdjieff|G. I. Gurdjieff]], and the varied psychoanalytical schools of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Alfred Adler|Adler]].) Watts also read widely in philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry and Eastern wisdom.\n\nBy his own reckoning, and also by that of his biographer [[Monica Furlong]], Watts was primarily an [[autodidact]]. His involvement with the Buddhist Lodge in London afforded Watts a considerable number of opportunities for [[personal growth]]. Through Humphreys, he contacted eminent spiritual authors, e.g. the artist, scholar, and mystic [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]], and prominent theosophists like [[Alice Bailey]].\n\nIn 1936, aged 21, he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the [[University of London]], heard [[D.&nbsp;T. Suzuki]] read a paper, and afterwards was able to meet this esteemed scholar of [[Zen Buddhism]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 78\u201382</ref> Beyond these discussions and personal encounters, Watts absorbed, by studying the available scholarly literature, the fundamental [[concept]]s and [[terminology]] of the main philosophies of India and [[East Asia]].\n\n===Influences and first publication===\nWatts's fascination with the [[Zen]] (or Ch'an) tradition\u2014beginning during the 1930s\u2014developed because that tradition embodied the spiritual, interwoven with the practical, as exemplified in the subtitle of his ''Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work, and Art in the Far East''. \"Work\", \"life\", and \"art\" were not demoted due to a spiritual focus. In his writing, he referred to it as \"the great Ch'an (or Zen) synthesis of [[Taoism]], Confucianism and Buddhism after AD 700 in China.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971 ''Behold the Spirit'', revised edition. New York: Random House / Vintage. p. 32</ref> Watts published his first book, ''The Spirit of Zen,'' in 1936. Two decades later, in ''The Way of Zen''<ref>Watts, Alan W., 1957, p.11</ref> he disparaged ''The Spirit of Zen'' as a \"popularisation of Suzuki's earlier works, and besides being very unscholarly it is in many respects out of date and misleading.\"\n\nWatts married Eleanor Everett, whose mother [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki|Ruth Fuller Everett]] was involved with a traditional Zen Buddhist circle in New York. Ruth Fuller later married the Zen master (or \"roshi\"), [[Sokei-an Sasaki]], who served as a sort of model and mentor to Watts, though he chose not to enter into a formal Zen training relationship with Sasaki. During these years, according to his later writings, Watts had another mystical experience while on a walk with his wife. In 1938 they left England to live in the United States. Watts became a United States citizen in 1943.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alan Wilson Watts |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Alan_Watts.aspx |publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography}}</ref>\n\n===Christian priest and afterwards===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n\nWatts left formal Zen training in New York because the method of the teacher did not suit him. He was not ordained as a Zen monk, but he felt a need to find a vocational outlet for his philosophical inclinations. He entered [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]], an Episcopal (Anglican) school in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied Christian scriptures, theology, and church history. He attempted to work out a blend of contemporary Christian worship, mystical Christianity, and Asian philosophy. Watts was awarded a master's degree in theology in response to his thesis, which he published as a popular edition under the title ''[[Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion]]''.\n\nHe later published ''Myth & Ritual in Christianity'' (1953), an [[eisegesis]] of traditional [[Roman Catholic]] doctrine and ritual in Buddhist terms. However, the pattern was set, in that Watts did not hide his dislike for religious outlooks that he decided were dour, guilt-ridden, or militantly proselytizing\u2014no matter if they were found within [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], or [[Buddhism]].\n\nAs recounted in his autobiography, Alan was [[Holy orders|ordained]] as an [[Episcopal priest]] in 1945 (aged 30) and resigned the ministry by 1950, partly as a result of an extramarital affair which resulted in his wife having their marriage annulled, but also because he could no longer reconcile his Buddhist beliefs with the formal doctrine of the church. He spent the New Year getting to know [[Joseph Campbell]] and Campbell's wife, [[Jean Erdman]], as well as the composer [[John Cage]].\n\nIn early 1951, Watts moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in [[San Francisco]]. Here he taught from 1951 to 1957 alongside Sabur\u014d Hasegawa (1906\u20131957), [[Frederic Spiegelberg]], [[Haridas Chaudhuri]], [[lama]] Tada T\u014dkan (1890\u20131967), and various visiting experts and professors. Hasegawa, in particular, served as a teacher to Watts in the areas of Japanese customs, arts, primitivism, and perceptions of nature. It was during this time he met the poet, [[Jean Burden]] with whom he had a four-year love affair.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-16/news/ga-6607_1_jean-burden/2|title=She's Well-Versed in the Art of Writing Well : Poetry: Author, editor and teacher Jean Burden shares her lifelong obsession through invitation-only workshops in her home. |last=Hudson |first=Berkley |date=1992-08-16 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>\n\nAlan credited her as an \"important influence\" in his life and gave her dedicatory cryptograph in his book \"Nature, Man and Woman\", to which he alludes in his autobiography (p.&nbsp;297). Besides teaching, Watts served for several years as the Academy's administrator. One notable student of his was [[Eugene Rose]], who later went on to become a noted [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[hieromonk]] and controversial [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|theologian]] within the Orthodox Church in America under the jurisdiction of [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|ROCOR]]. Rose's own disciple, a fellow monastic priest published under the name Hieromonk Damascene, produced a book entitled ''Christ the Eternal Tao'', in which the author [[comparative religion|draws parallels]] between the concept of the Tao in Chinese philosophy and the concept of the ''[[Logos]]'' in classical Greek philosophy and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] theology.\n\nWatts also studied written Chinese and practiced Chinese brush calligraphy with Hasegawa as well as with some of the Chinese students who enrolled at the academy. While Watts was noted for an interest in [[Zen Buddhism]], his reading and discussions delved into [[Vedanta]], \"[[quantum physics|the new physics]]\", [[cybernetics]], [[semantics]], [[process philosophy]], [[natural history]], and the [[anthropology]] of sexuality.\n\n==Middle years==\nWatts left the faculty for a career in the mid-1950s. In 1953, he began what became a long-running weekly radio program at Pacifica Radio station [[KPFA]] in Berkeley. Like other volunteer programmers at the listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts. These weekly broadcasts continued until 1962, by which time he had attracted a \"legion of regular listeners\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/kpfafolio131paci ''KPFA Folio'', Volume 13, no. 1], 9\u201322 April 1962, p. 14.

These recordings are broadcast to this day. For example, in 1970 Watts lectures were broadcast on Sunday mornings on San Francisco radio station KSAN;<ref>Susan Krieger, ''Hip Capitalism'', 1979, Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, {{ISBN|0-8039-1263-3}} pbk., p. 170.</ref> and even today a number of radio stations continue to have an Alan Watts program in their weekly program schedules.<ref>[http://kkup.org/sched/weekly.html KKUP Program Schedule] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510063805/http://www.kkup.org/sched/weekly.html |date=10 May 2016 }}.

Besides drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen in India and China, Watts introduced ideas drawn from [[general semantics]] (directly from the writings of [[Alfred Korzybski]]) and also from [[Norbert Wiener]]'s early work on [[cybernetics]], which had recently been published. Watts offered analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life. The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen his lecture circuit.\n\nIn 1958, Watts toured parts of Europe with his father, meeting the Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] and the German psychotherapist [[Karlfried Graf D\u00fcrckheim]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 321.</ref>\n\nUpon returning to the United States, Watts recorded two seasons of a television series (1959\u20131960) for [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] public television in San Francisco, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life\".<ref>Alan Watts, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life, [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL772D292429735309 Season 1 (1959)\"] and [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA1C3BAC2EB58EE47 Season 2 (1960)], KQED public television series, San Francisco</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Watts became interested in how identifiable patterns in nature tend to repeat themselves from the smallest of scales to the most immense. This became one of his passions in his research and thought.<ref>Ropp, Robert S. de 1995, 2002 ''Warrior's Way: a Twentieth Century Odyssey''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, pp. 333\u2013334.</ref>\n\nThough never affiliated for long with any one academic institution, he was Professor of Comparative Philosophy at the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]] (as mentioned above), had a fellowship at [[Harvard University]] (1962\u20131964), and was a Scholar at [[San Jose State University]] (1968).<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan Watts - Life and Works|url=http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|access-date=25 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802050948/http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|archive-date=2 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also lectured college and university students as well as the general public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deoxy Org: Alan Watts|url=http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819233823/http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|archivedate=19 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His lectures and books gave him influence on the American intelligentsia of the 1950s\u20131970s, but he was often seen as an outsider in academia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weidenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=Complaining about Alan Watts|url=https://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140803085526/http://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|url-status = dead|archive-date=2014-08-03}}</ref> When questioned sharply by students during his talk at [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], in 1970, Watts responded, as he had from the early sixties, that he was not an academic philosopher but rather \"a philosophical entertainer\".<ref name=\"NR\" />\n\n===Experimentation===\n\nSome of Watts' writings published in 1958 (e.g., his book ''Nature, Man and Woman'' and his essay \"The New Alchemy\") mentioned some of his early views on the use of psychedelic drugs for mystical insight. Watts had begun to experiment with psychedelics, initially with [[mescaline]] given to him by [[Oscar Janiger]]. He tried [[LSD]] several times in 1958, with various research teams led by Keith S. Ditman, Sterling Bunnell Jr., and Michael Agron. He also tried [[marijuana]] and concluded that it was a useful and interesting psychoactive drug that gave the impression of time slowing down. Watts' books of the '60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook.<ref name=\"Joyous 26\">''The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness'' (the quote is new to the 1965/1970 edition (page 26), and not contained in the original 1962 edition of the book).</ref>\n\nHe later said about psychedelic drug use, \"If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.\"<ref name=\"Joyous 26\"/>\n\nFor a time, Watts came to prefer writing in the language of modern science and psychology (such as ''Psychotherapy East and West''), finding a parallel between mystical experiences and the theories of the material universe proposed by 20th-century physicists. He later equated mystical experience with ecological awareness, and typically emphasized whichever approach seemed best suited to the audience he was addressing.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Applied aesthetics===\n\nWatts sometimes ate with his group of neighbors in [[Druid Heights]] (near [[Mill Valley]], California) who had endeavored to combine architecture, gardening, and carpentry skills to make a beautiful and comfortable life for themselves. These neighbors accomplished this by relying on their own talents and using their own hands, as they lived in what has been called \"shared bohemian poverty\".<ref>^ Davis, Erik (May 2005).

He felt such teaching could improve the world, at least to a degree. He also articulated the possibilities for greater incorporation of [[aesthetics]] (for example: better architecture, more art, more fine cuisine) in American life. In his autobiography he wrote, \"\u2026 cultural renewal comes about when highly differentiated cultures mix\".<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 247.</ref>\n\nIn his last novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), Huxley mentions the religious practice of [[maithuna]] as being something like that which [[Roman Catholics]] call \"''[[coitus reservatus]]''\". A few years before, Watts had discussed the theme in his own book, ''Nature, Man and Woman'', in which he discusses the possibility of the practice being known to early Christians and of it being kept secretly by the Church.\n\n==Later years==\n\nIn his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the practicality in the historical achievements of [[Ch\u00e1n]] (Zen) in the Far East, for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians, artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the monasteries of its lineages. In his mature work, he presents himself as \"Zennist\" in spirit as he wrote in his last book, ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of great interest to him.\n\nThough known for his discourses on Zen, he was also influenced by ancient Hindu scriptures, especially Vedanta. He spoke extensively about the nature of the divine reality which Man misses: how the contradiction of opposites is the method of life and the means of cosmic and human evolution, how our fundamental Ignorance is rooted in the exclusive nature of mind and ego, how to come in touch with the Field of Consciousness and Light, and other cosmic principles. These are discussed in great detail in dozens of hours of audio that are in part captured in the 'Out of Your Mind' series.\n\nWatts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his classic comments on love relationships in \"Divine Madness\" and on perception of the organism-environment in \"The Philosophy of Nature\". In looking at social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance and understanding among disparate cultures.\n\nWatts also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament. Writing, for example, in the early 1960s: \"Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin\u2014especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away?\"<ref>''The Joyous Cosmology'', p. 63</ref> These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot made for [[National Educational Television|NET]] (National Educational Television) filmed at his mountain retreat in 1971 in which he noted that the single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.\n\n==Death==\n\nIn October 1973, Watts returned from a European lecture tour to his cabin in [[Druid Heights]], California. Friends of Watts had been concerned about him for some time over his [[alcoholism]].<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\"/><ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\"/> On 16 November 1973, at age 58, he died in his sleep.

His ashes were split, with half buried near his library at [[Druid Heights]] and half at the Green Gulch Monastery.\n\nA personal account of Watts' last years and approach to death is given by [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]] in ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Alan|editor1-last=Huang|editor1-first=Chungliang Al|editor1-link=Foreword|editor2-link=Once Again: A New Beginning|title=TAO: The Watercourse Way (Foreword)|date=1975|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-73311-8|pages=vii\u2013xiii|url=https://archive.org/details/taowatercoursewa00watt_0}}</ref> His son Mark Watts has prepared a biographical documentary that details questions surrounding his father's death and performed ritual cremation on a nearby beach.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.alanwatts.com/ |title=Alan Watts Talks & Lectures}}</ref>  His father's ashes were returned to the cabin where he had died.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6wsw8Xpcds&t=4m11s Live Fully Now: Mark Watts], interview at Druid Heights cabin by Volvo Cars (posted to YouTube on Feb 22, 2017)</ref>\n\nSince Watts' death, his lectures have found posthumous popularity on the internet, specifically YouTube.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ozy.com/good-sht/the-dead-philosopher-injecting-spirituality-into-mass-culture-on-youtube/96746 |title=A Dead Philosopher Makes New Connections on YouTube |last=Braswell |first=Sean |date=2019-10-08 |website=www.ozy.com |access-date=2019-10-15}}\n</ref>\n\n==Views==\n\n===On spiritual and social identity===\n\nIn regards to his ethical outlook, Watts felt that [[moral absolutism|absolute morality]] had nothing to do with the fundamental realization of one's deep spiritual identity. He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He wrote out of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape.\n\nHe often said that he wished to act as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, between East and West, and between culture and nature.\n\nWatts led some tours for Westerners to the Buddhist temples of Japan. He also studied some movements from the traditional [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial]] art [[taijiquan]], with an Asian colleague, [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]].\n\n===Worldview===\n\nIn several of his later publications, especially ''Beyond Theology'' and ''The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'', Watts put forward a [[worldview]], drawing on [[Hinduism]], [[Chinese philosophy]], [[pantheism]] or [[panentheism]], and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic Self playing hide-and-seek ([[Lila (Hinduism)|Lila]]); hiding from itself ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe and forgetting what it really is \u2013 the upshot being that we are all IT in disguise. In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception of ourselves as an \"[[ego (spirituality)|ego]] in a bag of skin,\" or \"skin-encapsulated ego\" is a [[myth]]; the entities we call the separate \"things\" are merely aspects or features of the whole.\n\nWatts' books frequently include discussions reflecting his keen interest in patterns that occur in nature and which are repeated in various ways and at a wide range of scales \u2013 including the patterns to be discerned in the history of civilizations.<ref>De Ropp, Robert S. 2002 ''Warrior's Way''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, p. 334.</ref><ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971, pp. 25\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Supporters and critics===\n\nWatts's explorations and teaching brought him into contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the [[human potential movement]]. His friendship with poet [[Gary Snyder]] nurtured his sympathies with the budding [[environmental movement]], to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered [[Robert Anton Wilson]], who credited Watts with being one of his \"Light[s] along the Way\" in the opening appreciation of ''[[Cosmic Trigger]]''. [[Werner Erhard]] attended workshops given by Alan Watts and said of him, \"He pointed me toward what I now call the distinction between Self and Mind. After my encounter with Alan, the context in which I was working shifted.\"<ref>William Warren Bartley, Werner Erhard, The Transformation of a Man</ref>\n\nWatts has been criticized by Buddhists such as [[Philip Kapleau]] and [[D. T. Suzuki]] for allegedly misinterpreting several key Zen Buddhist concepts. In particular, he drew criticism from those who believe that [[zazen]] must entail a strict and specific means of sitting, as opposed to a cultivated state of mind available at any moment in any situation. Typical of these is Kapleau's claim that Watts dismissed [[zazen]] on the basis of only half a [[koan]].<ref>Kapleau 1967, pp. 21\u201322</ref>\n\nIn regard to the aforementioned koan, [[Robert Baker Aitken]] reports that Suzuki told him, \"I regret to say that Mr. Watts did not understand that story.\"<ref>[[#refAitken|Aitken 1997]], p. 30. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SS-Dc6ox4hYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22original+dwelling+place%22#PPA29,M1]</ref> In his talks, Watts addressed the issue of defining zazen practice by saying, \"A cat sits until it is tired of sitting, then gets up, stretches, and walks away\", and referring<ref>Alan Watts: ''The truth of the birthless mind'', from ''Out of You Mind'', Session 8, Lecture 8.</ref> to  Zen master [[Bankei]]: \"Even when you're sitting in meditation, if there's something you've got to do, it's quite all right to get up and leave\".<ref>Peter Haskel (ed.): ''Bankei Zen: Translations from The Record of Bankei''. Grove Press, New York 1984. Page 59.</ref> \n\nHowever, Watts did have his supporters in the Zen community, including [[Shunryu Suzuki]], the founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]]. As [[David Chadwick (writer)|David Chadwick]] recounted in his biography of Suzuki, ''Crooked Cucumber: the Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', when a student of Suzuki's disparaged Watts by saying \"we used to think he was profound until we found the real thing\", Suzuki fumed with a sudden intensity, saying, \"You completely miss the point about Alan Watts! You should notice what he has done. He is a great [[bodhisattva]].\"<ref>Chadwick, D: ''Crooked Cucumber: The Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', Broadway Books,2000</ref>\n\nWatts's biographers saw him, after his stint as an Anglican priest, as representative of no religion but as a lone-wolf thinker and social rascal. In David Stuart's warts-and-all biography of the man, Watts is seen as an unusually gifted speaker and writer driven by his own interests, enthusiasms, and demons.<ref>Stuart, David 1976 ''Alan Watts''. Pennsylvania: Chilton.</ref> Elsa Gidlow, whom Alan called \"sister\", refused to be interviewed for this work but later painted a kinder picture of Alan's life in her own autobiography, ''Elsa, I Come With My Songs''. According to critic [[Erik Davis]], his \"writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanizing lucidity.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=David |first=Erik |authorlink=Erik Davis |year=2006 |title=The Visionary State: A Journey through California's Spiritual Landscape |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=0-8118-4835-3}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nWatts married three times and had seven children (five daughters and two sons). \nWatts met Eleanor Everett in 1936, when her mother, Ruth Fuller Everett, brought her to London to study piano. They met at the Buddhist Lodge, were engaged the following year and married in April 1938. A daughter, Joan, was born in November 1938 and another, Anne, was born in 1942. Their marriage ended in 1949, but Watts continued to correspond with his former mother-in-law.<ref>Stirling 2006, p. 27</ref>\nIn 1950, Watts married Dorothy DeWitt. He moved to San Francisco in early 1951 to teach. They began a family that grew to include five children: Tia, Mark, Richard, Lila, and Diane. The couple separated in the early 1960s after Watts met Mary Jane Yates King (called \"Jano\" in his circle) while lecturing in New York. After a difficult divorce he married King in 1964. The couple divided their time between [[Sausalito, California]],<ref>''The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'' (1966)</ref> where they lived on a [[houseboat]] called the ''[[Vallejo (ferry)|Vallejo]]'',<ref>Watts, Alan, 1973, pp. 300\u2013304</ref> and a secluded cabin in [[Druid Heights]], on the southwest flank of [[Mount Tamalpais]] north of San Francisco.\nSome regard Watts as having been an unfaithful husband and a poor father.<ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\">{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@julesevans/alan-watts-genius-or-charlatan-72313fae997d|title=Alan Watts: genius or charlatan?|last=Evans |first=Jules |date=2019-02-01|website=Medium |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\">{{Cite web |url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/alan-watts-reconsidered/ |title=Alan Watts Reconsidered |last=Guy |first=David |website=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\nWatts' eldest daughters, Joan and Anne, own and manage most of the copyrights to his books. His son, Mark, serves as curator of his father's audio, video and film and has published content of some of his spoken lectures in print format.\n\n[[Jean Burden]], his lover and the inspiration/editor of ''Nature, Man and Woman'', remained in his thoughts to the end of his life.\n\nWatts was a heavy smoker throughout his life<ref name=\"Reconsidered\"/> and in his later years drank heavily.<ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{main|Works by Alan Watts}}\n\nNote: ISBN's for titles originally published prior to 1974 are for reprint editions.\n\n* 1932 ''An Outline of Zen Buddhism'', The Golden Vista Press (32 page pamphlet)\n* 1936 ''The Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work and Art in the Far East'', [[E.P.

Born in [[Chislehurst]], England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began [[Zen]] training in New York. He received a master's degree in [[theology]] from [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]] and became an [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] priest in 1945. He left the ministry in 1950 and moved to [[California]], where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]].<ref>James Craig Holte ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kWJoPT3zBK0C&pg=PA199&dq=Alan+Watts+american+citizen&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DGAiUfOLHZCoqQGtkYDwBQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Alan%20Watts%20american%20citizen&f=false The Conversion Experience in America: A 'Sourcebook on American Religious Conversion Autobiography]'' page 199</ref>\n\nWatts gained a following while working as a volunteer programmer at the [[KPFA]] radio station in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. He wrote more than 25 books and articles on religion and philosophy, introducing the emerging [[Counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] to ''[[The Way of Zen]]'' (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism. In ''Psychotherapy East and West'' (1961), he argued that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of [[psychotherapy]]. He considered ''Nature, Man and Woman'' (1958) to be, \"from a literary point of view\u2014the best book I have ever written.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |year=1973 |title=In My Own Way: An Autobiography 1915\u20131965 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York |page=280}}</ref> He also explored human consciousness and [[psychedelic]]s in works such as \"The New Alchemy\" (1958) and ''The Joyous Cosmology'' (1962).\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Alan Watts age7.JPG|thumb|upright|Watts aged 7]]\n\nWatts was born to middle-class parents in the village of [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]] (now south-east London), on 6 January 1915, living at 3 (now 5) Holbrook Lane, which was previously lived in by author [[John Hemming-Clark]] in the early 1900s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.johnhemmingclark.com/media|title=Media}}</ref> Watts' father, Laurence Wilson Watts, was a representative for the London office of the [[Michelin]] tyre company. His mother, Emily Mary Watts (n\u00e9e Buchan), was a housewife whose father had been a [[missionary]]. With modest financial means, they chose to live in pastoral surroundings and Watts, an only child, grew up playing at Brookside, learning the names of wildflowers and butterflies.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, Part 1</ref> Probably because of the influence of his mother's religious family<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 12.</ref> the Buchans, an interest in \"ultimate things\" seeped in. It mixed with Watts's own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East.<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 22</ref>\n\nWatts also later wrote of a [[mystical]] dream he experienced while ill with a fever as a child.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 322</ref> During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote \"I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float...\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> These works of art emphasised the participatory relationship of people in nature, a theme that stood fast throughout his life and one that he often wrote about. (See, for instance, the last chapter in ''[[The Way of Zen]]''.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1957, Part 2, Chapter 4</ref>)\n\n===Buddhism===\n\nBy his own assessment, Watts was imaginative, headstrong, and talkative. He was sent to [[boarding school]]s (which included both academic and religious training of the \"[[Muscular Christianity|Muscular Christian]]\" sort) from early years. Of this religious training, he remarked \"Throughout my schooling my religious indoctrination was grim and maudlin.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 60</ref>\n\nWatts spent several holidays in [[France]] in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] with strong interests in both [[Buddhism]] and exotic little-known aspects of European culture. It was not long afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the [[Anglican]] Christianity he had been exposed to and the Buddhism he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw's. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the [[London Buddhist Lodge]], which had been established by [[Theosophism|Theosophists]], and was then run by the barrister [[Christmas Humphreys]]. Watts became the organization's secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of [[meditation]] during these years.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Education===\n\nWatts attended [[The King's School, Canterbury]], next door to [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Though he was frequently at the top of his classes scholastically and was given responsibilities at school, he botched an opportunity for a [[scholarship]] to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] by styling a crucial examination essay in a way that was read as \"presumptuous and capricious.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 102</ref>\n\nWhen he left secondary school, Watts worked in a printing house and later a bank. He spent his spare time involved with the [[Buddhist Society|Buddhist Lodge]] and also under the tutelage of a \"rascal guru\" named [[Dimitrije Mitrinovi\u0107]]. (Mitrinovi\u0107 was himself influenced by [[P. D. Ouspensky|Peter Demianovich Ouspensky]], [[George Gurdjieff|G. I. Gurdjieff]], and the varied psychoanalytical schools of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Alfred Adler|Adler]].) Watts also read widely in philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry and Eastern wisdom.\n\nBy his own reckoning, and also by that of his biographer [[Monica Furlong]], Watts was primarily an [[autodidact]]. His involvement with the Buddhist Lodge in London afforded Watts a considerable number of opportunities for [[personal growth]]. Through Humphreys, he contacted eminent spiritual authors, e.g. the artist, scholar, and mystic [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]], and prominent theosophists like [[Alice Bailey]].\n\nIn 1936, aged 21, he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the [[University of London]], heard [[D.&nbsp;T. Suzuki]] read a paper, and afterwards was able to meet this esteemed scholar of [[Zen Buddhism]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 78\u201382</ref> Beyond these discussions and personal encounters, Watts absorbed, by studying the available scholarly literature, the fundamental [[concept]]s and [[terminology]] of the main philosophies of India and [[East Asia]].\n\n===Influences and first publication===\nWatts's fascination with the [[Zen]] (or Ch'an) tradition\u2014beginning during the 1930s\u2014developed because that tradition embodied the spiritual, interwoven with the practical, as exemplified in the subtitle of his ''Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work, and Art in the Far East''. \"Work\", \"life\", and \"art\" were not demoted due to a spiritual focus. In his writing, he referred to it as \"the great Ch'an (or Zen) synthesis of [[Taoism]], Confucianism and Buddhism after AD 700 in China.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971 ''Behold the Spirit'', revised edition. New York: Random House / Vintage. p. 32</ref> Watts published his first book, ''The Spirit of Zen,'' in 1936. Two decades later, in ''The Way of Zen''<ref>Watts, Alan W., 1957, p.11</ref> he disparaged ''The Spirit of Zen'' as a \"popularisation of Suzuki's earlier works, and besides being very unscholarly it is in many respects out of date and misleading.\"\n\nWatts married Eleanor Everett, whose mother [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki|Ruth Fuller Everett]] was involved with a traditional Zen Buddhist circle in New York. Ruth Fuller later married the Zen master (or \"roshi\"), [[Sokei-an Sasaki]], who served as a sort of model and mentor to Watts, though he chose not to enter into a formal Zen training relationship with Sasaki. During these years, according to his later writings, Watts had another mystical experience while on a walk with his wife. In 1938 they left England to live in the United States. Watts became a United States citizen in 1943.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alan Wilson Watts |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Alan_Watts.aspx |publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography}}</ref>\n\n===Christian priest and afterwards===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n\nWatts left formal Zen training in New York because the method of the teacher did not suit him. He was not ordained as a Zen monk, but he felt a need to find a vocational outlet for his philosophical inclinations. He entered [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]], an Episcopal (Anglican) school in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied Christian scriptures, theology, and church history. He attempted to work out a blend of contemporary Christian worship, mystical Christianity, and Asian philosophy. Watts was awarded a master's degree in theology in response to his thesis, which he published as a popular edition under the title ''[[Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion]]''.\n\nHe later published ''Myth & Ritual in Christianity'' (1953), an [[eisegesis]] of traditional [[Roman Catholic]] doctrine and ritual in Buddhist terms. However, the pattern was set, in that Watts did not hide his dislike for religious outlooks that he decided were dour, guilt-ridden, or militantly proselytizing\u2014no matter if they were found within [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], or [[Buddhism]].\n\nAs recounted in his autobiography, Alan was [[Holy orders|ordained]] as an [[Episcopal priest]] in 1945 (aged 30) and resigned the ministry by 1950, partly as a result of an extramarital affair which resulted in his wife having their marriage annulled, but also because he could no longer reconcile his Buddhist beliefs with the formal doctrine of the church. He spent the New Year getting to know [[Joseph Campbell]] and Campbell's wife, [[Jean Erdman]], as well as the composer [[John Cage]].\n\nIn early 1951, Watts moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in [[San Francisco]]. Here he taught from 1951 to 1957 alongside Sabur\u014d Hasegawa (1906\u20131957), [[Frederic Spiegelberg]], [[Haridas Chaudhuri]], [[lama]] Tada T\u014dkan (1890\u20131967), and various visiting experts and professors. Hasegawa, in particular, served as a teacher to Watts in the areas of Japanese customs, arts, primitivism, and perceptions of nature. It was during this time he met the poet, [[Jean Burden]] with whom he had a four-year love affair.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-16/news/ga-6607_1_jean-burden/2|title=She's Well-Versed in the Art of Writing Well : Poetry: Author, editor and teacher Jean Burden shares her lifelong obsession through invitation-only workshops in her home. |last=Hudson |first=Berkley |date=1992-08-16 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>\n\nAlan credited her as an \"important influence\" in his life and gave her dedicatory cryptograph in his book \"Nature, Man and Woman\", to which he alludes in his autobiography (p.&nbsp;297). Besides teaching, Watts served for several years as the Academy's administrator. One notable student of his was [[Eugene Rose]], who later went on to become a noted [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[hieromonk]] and controversial [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|theologian]] within the Orthodox Church in America under the jurisdiction of [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|ROCOR]]. Rose's own disciple, a fellow monastic priest published under the name Hieromonk Damascene, produced a book entitled ''Christ the Eternal Tao'', in which the author [[comparative religion|draws parallels]] between the concept of the Tao in Chinese philosophy and the concept of the ''[[Logos]]'' in classical Greek philosophy and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] theology.\n\nWatts also studied written Chinese and practiced Chinese brush calligraphy with Hasegawa as well as with some of the Chinese students who enrolled at the academy. While Watts was noted for an interest in [[Zen Buddhism]], his reading and discussions delved into [[Vedanta]], \"[[quantum physics|the new physics]]\", [[cybernetics]], [[semantics]], [[process philosophy]], [[natural history]], and the [[anthropology]] of sexuality.\n\n==Middle years==\nWatts left the faculty for a career in the mid-1950s. In 1953, he began what became a long-running weekly radio program at Pacifica Radio station [[KPFA]] in Berkeley. Like other volunteer programmers at the listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts. These weekly broadcasts continued until 1962, by which time he had attracted a \"legion of regular listeners\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/kpfafolio131paci ''KPFA Folio'', Volume 13, no. 1], 9\u201322 April 1962, p. 14.

These recordings are broadcast to this day. For example, in 1970 Watts lectures were broadcast on Sunday mornings on San Francisco radio station KSAN;<ref>Susan Krieger, ''Hip Capitalism'', 1979, Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, {{ISBN|0-8039-1263-3}} pbk., p. 170.</ref> and even today a number of radio stations continue to have an Alan Watts program in their weekly program schedules.<ref>[http://kkup.org/sched/weekly.html KKUP Program Schedule] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510063805/http://www.kkup.org/sched/weekly.html |date=10 May 2016 }}.

Besides drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen in India and China, Watts introduced ideas drawn from [[general semantics]] (directly from the writings of [[Alfred Korzybski]]) and also from [[Norbert Wiener]]'s early work on [[cybernetics]], which had recently been published. Watts offered analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life. The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen his lecture circuit.\n\nIn 1958, Watts toured parts of Europe with his father, meeting the Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] and the German psychotherapist [[Karlfried Graf D\u00fcrckheim]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 321.</ref>\n\nUpon returning to the United States, Watts recorded two seasons of a television series (1959\u20131960) for [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] public television in San Francisco, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life\".<ref>Alan Watts, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life, [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL772D292429735309 Season 1 (1959)\"] and [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA1C3BAC2EB58EE47 Season 2 (1960)], KQED public television series, San Francisco</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Watts became interested in how identifiable patterns in nature tend to repeat themselves from the smallest of scales to the most immense. This became one of his passions in his research and thought.<ref>Ropp, Robert S. de 1995, 2002 ''Warrior's Way: a Twentieth Century Odyssey''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, pp. 333\u2013334.</ref>\n\nThough never affiliated for long with any one academic institution, he was Professor of Comparative Philosophy at the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]] (as mentioned above), had a fellowship at [[Harvard University]] (1962\u20131964), and was a Scholar at [[San Jose State University]] (1968).<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan Watts - Life and Works|url=http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|access-date=25 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802050948/http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|archive-date=2 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also lectured college and university students as well as the general public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deoxy Org: Alan Watts|url=http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819233823/http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|archivedate=19 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His lectures and books gave him influence on the American intelligentsia of the 1950s\u20131970s, but he was often seen as an outsider in academia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weidenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=Complaining about Alan Watts|url=https://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140803085526/http://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|url-status = dead|archive-date=2014-08-03}}</ref> When questioned sharply by students during his talk at [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], in 1970, Watts responded, as he had from the early sixties, that he was not an academic philosopher but rather \"a philosophical entertainer\".<ref name=\"NR\" />\n\n===Experimentation===\n\nSome of Watts' writings published in 1958 (e.g., his book ''Nature, Man and Woman'' and his essay \"The New Alchemy\") mentioned some of his early views on the use of psychedelic drugs for mystical insight. Watts had begun to experiment with psychedelics, initially with [[mescaline]] given to him by [[Oscar Janiger]]. He tried [[LSD]] several times in 1958, with various research teams led by Keith S. Ditman, Sterling Bunnell Jr., and Michael Agron. He also tried [[marijuana]] and concluded that it was a useful and interesting psychoactive drug that gave the impression of time slowing down. Watts' books of the '60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook.<ref name=\"Joyous 26\">''The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness'' (the quote is new to the 1965/1970 edition (page 26), and not contained in the original 1962 edition of the book).</ref>\n\nHe later said about psychedelic drug use, \"If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.\"<ref name=\"Joyous 26\"/>\n\nFor a time, Watts came to prefer writing in the language of modern science and psychology (such as ''Psychotherapy East and West''), finding a parallel between mystical experiences and the theories of the material universe proposed by 20th-century physicists. He later equated mystical experience with ecological awareness, and typically emphasized whichever approach seemed best suited to the audience he was addressing.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Applied aesthetics===\n\nWatts sometimes ate with his group of neighbors in [[Druid Heights]] (near [[Mill Valley]], California) who had endeavored to combine architecture, gardening, and carpentry skills to make a beautiful and comfortable life for themselves.

He felt such teaching could improve the world, at least to a degree. He also articulated the possibilities for greater incorporation of [[aesthetics]] (for example: better architecture, more art, more fine cuisine) in American life. In his autobiography he wrote, \"\u2026 cultural renewal comes about when highly differentiated cultures mix\".<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 247.</ref>\n\nIn his last novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), Huxley mentions the religious practice of [[maithuna]] as being something like that which [[Roman Catholics]] call \"''[[coitus reservatus]]''\". A few years before, Watts had discussed the theme in his own book, ''Nature, Man and Woman'', in which he discusses the possibility of the practice being known to early Christians and of it being kept secretly by the Church.\n\n==Later years==\n\nIn his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the practicality in the historical achievements of [[Ch\u00e1n]] (Zen) in the Far East, for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians, artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the monasteries of its lineages. In his mature work, he presents himself as \"Zennist\" in spirit as he wrote in his last book, ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of great interest to him.\n\nThough known for his discourses on Zen, he was also influenced by ancient Hindu scriptures, especially Vedanta. He spoke extensively about the nature of the divine reality which Man misses: how the contradiction of opposites is the method of life and the means of cosmic and human evolution, how our fundamental Ignorance is rooted in the exclusive nature of mind and ego, how to come in touch with the Field of Consciousness and Light, and other cosmic principles. These are discussed in great detail in dozens of hours of audio that are in part captured in the 'Out of Your Mind' series.\n\nWatts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his classic comments on love relationships in \"Divine Madness\" and on perception of the organism-environment in \"The Philosophy of Nature\". In looking at social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance and understanding among disparate cultures.\n\nWatts also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament. Writing, for example, in the early 1960s: \"Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin\u2014especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away?\"<ref>''The Joyous Cosmology'', p. 63</ref> These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot made for [[National Educational Television|NET]] (National Educational Television) filmed at his mountain retreat in 1971 in which he noted that the single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.\n\n==Death==\n\nIn October 1973, Watts returned from a European lecture tour to his cabin in [[Druid Heights]], California. Friends of Watts had been concerned about him for some time over his [[alcoholism]].<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\"/><ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\"/> On 16 November 1973, at age 58, he died in his sleep.

His ashes were split, with half buried near his library at [[Druid Heights]] and half at the Green Gulch Monastery.\n\nA personal account of Watts' last years and approach to death is given by [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]] in ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Alan|editor1-last=Huang|editor1-first=Chungliang Al|editor1-link=Foreword|editor2-link=Once Again: A New Beginning|title=TAO: The Watercourse Way (Foreword)|date=1975|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-73311-8|pages=vii\u2013xiii|url=https://archive.org/details/taowatercoursewa00watt_0}}</ref> His son Mark Watts has prepared a biographical documentary that details questions surrounding his father's death and performed ritual cremation on a nearby beach.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.alanwatts.com/ |title=Alan Watts Talks & Lectures}}</ref>  His father's ashes were returned to the cabin where he had died.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6wsw8Xpcds&t=4m11s Live Fully Now: Mark Watts], interview at Druid Heights cabin by Volvo Cars (posted to YouTube on Feb 22, 2017)</ref>\n\nSince Watts' death, his lectures have found posthumous popularity on the internet, specifically YouTube.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ozy.com/good-sht/the-dead-philosopher-injecting-spirituality-into-mass-culture-on-youtube/96746 |title=A Dead Philosopher Makes New Connections on YouTube |last=Braswell |first=Sean |date=2019-10-08 |website=www.ozy.com |access-date=2019-10-15}}\n</ref>\n\n==Views==\n\n===On spiritual and social identity===\n\nIn regards to his ethical outlook, Watts felt that [[moral absolutism|absolute morality]] had nothing to do with the fundamental realization of one's deep spiritual identity. He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He wrote out of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape.\n\nHe often said that he wished to act as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, between East and West, and between culture and nature.\n\nWatts led some tours for Westerners to the Buddhist temples of Japan. He also studied some movements from the traditional [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial]] art [[taijiquan]], with an Asian colleague, [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]].\n\n===Worldview===\n\nIn several of his later publications, especially ''Beyond Theology'' and ''The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'', Watts put forward a [[worldview]], drawing on [[Hinduism]], [[Chinese philosophy]], [[pantheism]] or [[panentheism]], and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic Self playing hide-and-seek ([[Lila (Hinduism)|Lila]]); hiding from itself ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe and forgetting what it really is \u2013 the upshot being that we are all IT in disguise. In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception of ourselves as an \"[[ego (spirituality)|ego]] in a bag of skin,\" or \"skin-encapsulated ego\" is a [[myth]]; the entities we call the separate \"things\" are merely aspects or features of the whole.\n\nWatts' books frequently include discussions reflecting his keen interest in patterns that occur in nature and which are repeated in various ways and at a wide range of scales \u2013 including the patterns to be discerned in the history of civilizations.<ref>De Ropp, Robert S. 2002 ''Warrior's Way''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, p. 334.</ref><ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971, pp. 25\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Supporters and critics===\n\nWatts's explorations and teaching brought him into contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the [[human potential movement]]. His friendship with poet [[Gary Snyder]] nurtured his sympathies with the budding [[environmental movement]], to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered [[Robert Anton Wilson]], who credited Watts with being one of his \"Light[s] along the Way\" in the opening appreciation of ''[[Cosmic Trigger]]''. [[Werner Erhard]] attended workshops given by Alan Watts and said of him, \"He pointed me toward what I now call the distinction between Self and Mind. After my encounter with Alan, the context in which I was working shifted.\"<ref>William Warren Bartley, Werner Erhard, The Transformation of a Man</ref>\n\nWatts has been criticized by Buddhists such as [[Philip Kapleau]] and [[D. T. Suzuki]] for allegedly misinterpreting several key Zen Buddhist concepts. In particular, he drew criticism from those who believe that [[zazen]] must entail a strict and specific means of sitting, as opposed to a cultivated state of mind available at any moment in any situation. Typical of these is Kapleau's claim that Watts dismissed [[zazen]] on the basis of only half a [[koan]].<ref>Kapleau 1967, pp. 21\u201322</ref>\n\nIn regard to the aforementioned koan, [[Robert Baker Aitken]] reports that Suzuki told him, \"I regret to say that Mr. Watts did not understand that story.\"<ref>[[#refAitken|Aitken 1997]], p. 30. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SS-Dc6ox4hYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22original+dwelling+place%22#PPA29,M1]</ref> In his talks, Watts addressed the issue of defining zazen practice by saying, \"A cat sits until it is tired of sitting, then gets up, stretches, and walks away\", and referring<ref>Alan Watts: ''The truth of the birthless mind'', from ''Out of You Mind'', Session 8, Lecture 8.</ref> to  Zen master [[Bankei]]: \"Even when you're sitting in meditation, if there's something you've got to do, it's quite all right to get up and leave\".<ref>Peter Haskel (ed.): ''Bankei Zen: Translations from The Record of Bankei''. Grove Press, New York 1984. Page 59.</ref> \n\nHowever, Watts did have his supporters in the Zen community, including [[Shunryu Suzuki]], the founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]]. As [[David Chadwick (writer)|David Chadwick]] recounted in his biography of Suzuki, ''Crooked Cucumber: the Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', when a student of Suzuki's disparaged Watts by saying \"we used to think he was profound until we found the real thing\", Suzuki fumed with a sudden intensity, saying, \"You completely miss the point about Alan Watts! You should notice what he has done. He is a great [[bodhisattva]].\"<ref>Chadwick, D: ''Crooked Cucumber: The Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', Broadway Books,2000</ref>\n\nWatts's biographers saw him, after his stint as an Anglican priest, as representative of no religion but as a lone-wolf thinker and social rascal. In David Stuart's warts-and-all biography of the man, Watts is seen as an unusually gifted speaker and writer driven by his own interests, enthusiasms, and demons.<ref>Stuart, David 1976 ''Alan Watts''. Pennsylvania: Chilton.</ref> Elsa Gidlow, whom Alan called \"sister\", refused to be interviewed for this work but later painted a kinder picture of Alan's life in her own autobiography, ''Elsa, I Come With My Songs''. According to critic [[Erik Davis]], his \"writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanizing lucidity.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=David |first=Erik |authorlink=Erik Davis |year=2006 |title=The Visionary State: A Journey through California's Spiritual Landscape |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=0-8118-4835-3}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nWatts married three times and had seven children (five daughters and two sons). \nWatts met Eleanor Everett in 1936, when her mother, Ruth Fuller Everett, brought her to London to study piano. They met at the Buddhist Lodge, were engaged the following year and married in April 1938. A daughter, Joan, was born in November 1938 and another, Anne, was born in 1942. Their marriage ended in 1949, but Watts continued to correspond with his former mother-in-law.<ref>Stirling 2006, p. 27</ref>\nIn 1950, Watts married Dorothy DeWitt. He moved to San Francisco in early 1951 to teach. They began a family that grew to include five children: Tia, Mark, Richard, Lila, and Diane. The couple separated in the early 1960s after Watts met Mary Jane Yates King (called \"Jano\" in his circle) while lecturing in New York. After a difficult divorce he married King in 1964. The couple divided their time between [[Sausalito, California]],<ref>''The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'' (1966)</ref> where they lived on a [[houseboat]] called the ''[[Vallejo (ferry)|Vallejo]]'',<ref>Watts, Alan, 1973, pp. 300\u2013304</ref> and a secluded cabin in [[Druid Heights]], on the southwest flank of [[Mount Tamalpais]] north of San Francisco.\nSome regard Watts as having been an unfaithful husband and a poor father.<ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\">{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@julesevans/alan-watts-genius-or-charlatan-72313fae997d|title=Alan Watts: genius or charlatan?|last=Evans |first=Jules |date=2019-02-01|website=Medium |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\">{{Cite web |url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/alan-watts-reconsidered/ |title=Alan Watts Reconsidered |last=Guy |first=David |website=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\nWatts' eldest daughters, Joan and Anne, own and manage most of the copyrights to his books. His son, Mark, serves as curator of his father's audio, video and film and has published content of some of his spoken lectures in print format.\n\n[[Jean Burden]], his lover and the inspiration/editor of ''Nature, Man and Woman'', remained in his thoughts to the end of his life.\n\nWatts was a heavy smoker throughout his life<ref name=\"Reconsidered\"/> and in his later years drank heavily.<ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{main|Works by Alan Watts}}\n\nNote: ISBN's for titles originally published prior to 1974 are for reprint editions.\n\n* 1932 ''An Outline of Zen Buddhism'', The Golden Vista Press (32 page pamphlet)\n* 1936 ''The Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work and Art in the Far East'', [[E.P.

Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of [[Zealand]]; another small portion of the city is located on [[Amager]], and it is separated from [[Malm\u00f6]], Sweden, by the strait of [[\u00d8resund]]. The [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] connects the two cities by rail and road.\n\nOriginally a [[Vikings|Viking]] fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now [[Gammel Strand]], Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the [[Kalmar Union]], governing the entire present day [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] region in a personal union with Sweden and [[Norway]] ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of [[Scandinavia]] under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|a plague outbreak]] and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and founding of such cultural institutions as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. After further disasters in the early 19th century when [[Horatio Nelson]] attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the [[Second World War]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in information technology, [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]], Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue, the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens]], [[Frederik's Church]], and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, [[Arres\u00f8]], lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]].\n\nCopenhagen is home to the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[Technical University of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen Business School]] and the [[IT University of Copenhagen]]. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC K\u00f8benhavn]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] football clubs. The annual [[Copenhagen Marathon]] was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.\n\nThe [[Copenhagen Metro]], launched in 2002, serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the [[S-train (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen S-train]], the [[Lokaltog]] ([[:da:Privatbane|private railway]]) and the [[Coast Line (Denmark)|Coast Line]] network serve and connect central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, [[Copenhagen Airport]], Kastrup, is the busiest airport in the [[Nordic countries]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nCopenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in [[Old Norse]], from which Danish descends, was '''Kaupmannah\u01ebfn''' [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Kaupmannah\u00f6fn'' [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Keypmannahavn''), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time [[Old Danish]] was spoken, the capital was called '''K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn''', with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular [[sound change]]. An exact English equivalent would be \"[[Chapmen|chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|first=Oluf|last=Nielsen|title=Kj\u00f8benhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C. Gad|year=1877|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> However, the English term for the city was adapted from its [[Low German]] name, ''Kopenhagen''.\n(English ''chapman'', German ''Kaufmann'', Dutch ''koopman'', Swedish ''k\u00f6pman'', Danish ''k\u00f8bmand'', Icelandic ''kaupma\u00f0ur'': in all these words, the first syllable comes ultimately from Latin ''caupo'', \"tradesman\".) Copenhagen's Swedish name is ''K\u00f6penhamn'', a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Copenhagen|Timeline of Copenhagen}}\n[[File:K\u00f8benhavn1500.jpg|right|thumb|Reconstruction of Copenhagen {{circa|1500}}]]\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent [[archaeological]] finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's [[Kongens Nytorv]] from c. 1020. Excavations in [[Pilestr\u00e6de]] have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where [[Str\u00f8get]] meets [[R\u00e5dhuspladsen]].\n\nThese finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of [[flint]] tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/arkaeologer-graver-ny-teori-om-kobenhavn-op-af-mulden|title=Ark\u00e6ologer graver ny teori om K\u00f8benhavn op af mulden|publisher=Videnskab.dk|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=12 November 2013|language=Danish}}</ref> Many historians believe the town dates to the late [[Viking Age]], and was possibly founded by [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn I Forkbeard]].{{sfn|Cunningham|2013|p=35}} \nThe natural harbour and good [[herring]] stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century.<ref name=khdsd>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie|title=K\u00f8benhavn \u2013 historie|website=Den Store Danske |access-date=12 November 2013 |language=Danish}}</ref> The first habitations were probably centred on [[Gammel Strand]] (literally \"old shore\") in the 11th century or even earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|title=Gammel Strand|publisher=K\u00f8benhavns Museum|accessdate=24 November 2013|language=Danish|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131124104344/http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|archivedate=24 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in [[Gesta Danorum]] referred to it as ''Portus Mercatorum'', meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the [[Danish language|Danish]] of the time, ''K\u00f8bmannahavn''.<ref name=metro1415>Skaarup; Jensen (2002), pp. 14\u201315</ref> Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to [[Absalon|Bishop Absalon]]'s construction of a modest fortress on the little island of [[Slotsholmen]] in 1167 where [[Christiansborg Palace]] stands today.{{sfn|Davies|1944|p=365}} The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by [[Wends|Wendish]] pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built.

Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with [[Malm\u00f6]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]], it was finally forced to capitulate to [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] supported by Dutch shipping. [[Christoffer Valkendorff]], a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development.<ref name=khdsd/> The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.\n\nDuring the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on [[Slotsholmen]]: the [[T\u00f8jhus Museum|T\u00f8jhus Arsenal]] and [[B\u00f8rsen]], the stock exchange.

Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of [[Zealand]]; another small portion of the city is located on [[Amager]], and it is separated from [[Malm\u00f6]], Sweden, by the strait of [[\u00d8resund]]. The [[\u00d8resund Bridge]] connects the two cities by rail and road.\n\nOriginally a [[Vikings|Viking]] fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now [[Gammel Strand]], Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the [[Kalmar Union]], governing the entire present day [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] region in a personal union with Sweden and [[Norway]] ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of [[Scandinavia]] under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|a plague outbreak]] and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and founding of such cultural institutions as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. After further disasters in the early 19th century when [[Horatio Nelson]] attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the [[Second World War]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in information technology, [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[\u00d8resund Bridge]], Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malm\u00f6, forming the [[\u00d8resund Region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue, the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens]], [[Frederik's Church]], and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions.

The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the [[F.C.

The original designation in [[Old Norse]], from which Danish descends, was '''Kaupmannah\u01ebfn''' [\u02e1kaupman\u02d0ah\u0252vn] (cf. modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Kaupmannah\u00f6fn'' [\u02e1k\u02b0\u00f8yhpman\u02d0ah\u0153pn], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Keypmannahavn''), meaning \"merchants' harbour\". By the time [[Old Danish]] was spoken, the capital was called '''K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn''', with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular [[sound change]]. An exact English equivalent would be \"[[Chapmen|chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|first=Oluf|last=Nielsen|title=Kj\u00f8benhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C.

The [[CAC 40]] is the exchange's [[Benchmarking|benchmark]], disseminated in [[Real-time computing|real time]]. Its components are included in the broader SBF 120 Index, a benchmark for investment funds. The SBF 250 index, a benchmark for the long-term performance of equity portfolios, includes all of the SBF 120; it is structured by sector. The MIDCAC index includes 100 of the most liquid medium-size stocks on the Premier March\u00e9 and Nouveau March\u00e9 calculated on the basis of opening and closing prices, while the Second March\u00e9 index focuses on that market.  Both indices are benchmarks for funds. The Nouveau March\u00e9 Index represents stocks in the growth market. The SBF-FCI index is based on a selection of convertible bonds that represent at least 70% of the total capitalization of this market, calculated twice daily. For derivatives, MONEP trades short-term and long-term stock options and futures and options on a family of [[S&P Dow Jones Indices|Dow Jones]] indices. MATIF's products include commodity future and options on European [[rapeseed]] and futures on rapeseed meal, European rapeseed oil, milling wheat, corn and sunflower seeds; interest rate futures and options on the Euro notional bond, five-year Euro and three-month PIBOR (Paris Interbank Offered Rate), and futures on the 30-year [[Eurobond (international)|Eurobond]] and two-year E-note, and index futures on the CAC 40.\n\n==Key figures==\nFor the fiscal year ending December 2004, Euronext Paris recorded sales of US $522&nbsp;million, a \u221212.9% decrease in sales from 2003.\n\nEuronext Paris has a US $2.9&nbsp;trillion total market capitalization of listed companies and average daily trading value of its combined markets of approximately US $102&nbsp;billion/\u20ac77&nbsp;billion (as of 28 February 2007).\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of French companies]]\n* [[CAC 40]]\n* [[CAC Next 20]]\n* [[French Society of Financial Analysts]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051130095545/http://www.bourse-de-paris.fr/ Euronext Paris website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080912232127/http://www.monep.fr/ MONEP website]\n\n{{Euronext topics}}\n{{France topics}}\n{{World Federation of Exchanges}}\n\n{{coord|48|52|07.42|N|02|19|37.81|E|type:landmark|display=title}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Financial services companies established in 2000]]\n[[Category:2000 establishments in France]]\n[[Category:Euronext|Paris]]\n[[Category:Economy of Paris]]\n[[Category:Futures exchanges]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Securities market located in Paris, France}}\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2011}}\n{{Infobox exchange\n|name       = Euronext Paris\n|nativename = \n|logo       = Euronext logo.svg\n|image      = [[File:Palais Brongniart Paris.jpg|250px]]\n|type       = [[Stock exchange]]\n|city       = [[Paris]]\n|country    = [[France]]\n|founded    = {{start date and age|df=yes|1724}} (as Paris Bourse)<br>{{Start date and age|df=yes|2000}} (as Euronext Paris)\n|owner      = [[Euronext]]\n|key_people = Anthony Attia ([[Chief executive officer|CEO]])\n|currency   = [[Euro|EUR]]\n|listings = 1,078<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boursedeparis.fr/cours/actions-paris|title=Cours, Bourse de Paris|publisher=Euronext|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref>\n|mcap       = \n|volume     = \n|indexes    = [[CAC 40]]<br>[[CAC Next 20]]<br>CAC Mid 60<br>[[CAC Small]]\n|homepage   = {{URL|www.boursedeparis.fr}}\n|footnotes  = \n}}\n\n'''Euronext Paris''' is France's securities market, formerly known as the '''Paris Bourse''', which merged with the [[Amsterdam]], [[Lisbon]], and [[Brussels]] exchanges in September 2000 to form [[Euronext]] NV, which is the second largest exchange in Europe behind the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[London Stock Exchange Group]].\n\n==Operations==\nIt operates the [[MATIF]] [[futures exchange]], which trades [[Futures contract|futures]] and [[option (finance)|options]] on [[interest rate]] products and commodities, and MONEP, [[Stock|equity]] and index futures and options.
