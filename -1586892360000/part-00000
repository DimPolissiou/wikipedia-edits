Zorbing entered the Concise [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 2001 where it was defined as: \"a sport in which a participant is secured inside an inner capsule in a large, transparent ball which is then rolled along the ground or down hills\".\n\n==Construction==\nThe orb is double-sectioned, with one ball inside the other with an air layer in between (unlike the [[water walking ball]], which is usually a single thin-walled ball). This acts as a [[shock absorber]] for the rider. Orbs are lightweight and made of flexible plastic. Many orbs have straps to hold the rider in place, while others leave the rider free to walk the orb around or be tossed about freely by the rolling motion. A typical orb is about {{convert|3|m|0}} in diameter with an inner orb size of about {{convert|2|m|0}}, leaving a 50\u201360&nbsp;centimetre (20\u201324&nbsp;in) air cushion around the riders.  The plastic is approximately {{convert|0.8|mm|2}} thick.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The inner and outer orbs are connected by small nylon strings.

Zorbing entered the Concise [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 2001 where it was defined as: \"a sport in which a participant is secured inside an inner capsule in a large, transparent ball which is then rolled along the ground or down hills\".\n\n==Construction==\nThe orb is double-sectioned, with one ball inside the other with an air layer in between (unlike the [[water walking ball]], which is usually a single thin-walled ball). This acts as a [[shock absorber]] for the rider. Orbs are lightweight and made of flexible plastic. Many orbs have straps to hold the rider in place, while others leave the rider free to walk the orb around or be tossed about freely by the rolling motion. A typical orb is about {{convert|3|m|0}} in diameter, with an inner orb size of about {{convert|2|m|0}}, leaving a 50\u201360&nbsp;centimetre (20\u201324&nbsp;in) air cushion around the riders.  The plastic is approximately {{convert|0.8|mm|2}} thick.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The inner and outer orbs are connected by small nylon strings. Orbs have one or two tunnel-like entrances.\n\n==Facilities==\n'Hill-Rolling' or 'Globe riding' are generic names for this activity and is practised in the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], [[Canada]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], the [[Slovak Republic]], [[Switzerland]], [[Japan]], [[Kochi]] in [[India]], [[Phuket]] in [[Thailand]], and [[Slovenia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In the [[United States]], there are facilities in [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]], [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]], [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]], and Roundtop Mountain Resort, Lewisberry and Pennsylvania.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Records==\nThe [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]] recognises four sphereing records:\n*Longest distance travelled in a single roll held by Steve Camp who travelled {{convert|570|m|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/greatest-distance-zorbing |title= Greatest Distance Zorbing |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=November 5, 2015}}</ref>\n*Fastest sphereing ride held by Rebecca Mazonson who reached a speed of {{convert|52|km/h|0}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/news/2006-11-09-guinness-world-records-day_x.htm |title=World's fastest 'zorbanaut' kicks off Guinness World Records Day |publisher=USA TODAY |accessdate=November 9, 2006}}</ref>\n*Longest time spent zorbing - 3:49:06.
