He became nationally known for filing charges against [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House majority leader]] [[Tom DeLay]] in September 2005 for [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiring]] to violate [[Texas]]' [[election law]] and/or to [[money laundering|launder]] money. In Texas, Earle was known for his criminal justice reform efforts which focused on crime prevention, alternative sentencing, victim advocacy, and the reintegration of former offenders into society. In 1983, Earle - an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] - prosecuted ''himself'' for an election law [[Offense (law)|violation]] after missing a [[campaign finance]] filing deadline by one day; he was fined $212.<ref name=\"CSDeLay\">{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1203/p01s04-usgn.html|title=The Texas DA pitted against the power of Tom DeLay|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=December 3, 2004|first=Kris|last=Axtman|accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref> Earle was a fixture in Travis County politics and served in public office there for more than 30 years, joking that he was asked if he was the \"District Eternity\".<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2020-04-06/former-travis-county-d-a-ronnie-earle-dies/</ref> \n\nEarle spoke extensively on his belief that the law guided public responses to crime but that it was society's collective \"ethics infrastructure\" that required support to deliver a safer, more just, and more livable community. This belief guided him, as he told the [[Austin Chronicle]] in 2008,  \"It really informs everything I've tried to do \u2013 well, not everything, but most of the things I've tried to do as district attorney, especially the most progressive and innovative things that we have done in this office. And the reason is because the law doesn't teach you how to act. ... What I have come to call the 'ethics infrastructure' teaches you how to act. And that is in that work of mommas and daddies and aunts and uncles and teachers and preachers and neighbors and cousins and friends \u2013 that's where you learn how to act, not from the law.\"<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2008-04-11/610887/</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early Life===\nEarle was born in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] and raised on a [[cattle]] [[ranching|ranch]] in [[Birdville, Texas]].<ref name=\"CSDeLay\" /> He achieved the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], earned money working as a [[lifeguard]], played [[American football|football]], and was president of his high school student council.<ref name=\"CSDeLay\" /><ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.salon.com/2005/11/12/earle_8/ | title = Earle's last stand | date = November 13, 2005 | first1 = Rob | last1 = Patterson | work = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] | via = www.salon.com | access-date = June 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEarle moved to Austin when he was 19 to attend the college at the [[University of Texas]] and law school at the [[University of Texas School of Law]]. In 1967, while a law student, he went to work in the office of Texas Governor [[John Connally]].<ref>\nDistrict Eternity - Ronnie Earle on Ronnie Earle - Austin Chronicle - https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2008-04-11/610887/</ref> After graduating from law school,{{cn|date=June 2019}} he was appointed and served as a municipal judge in that city from 1969 to 1972.

He faced opponents only twice during his unprecedented tenure.<ref>Austin American-Statesman - \"Former Travis County DA Ronnie Earle has died\" - https://www.statesman.com/news/20200405/breaking-former-travis-county-da-ronnie-earle-has-died</ref>\n\nEarle was married to his second wife, Twila Hugley Earle, for nearly three decades. With his first wife, Barbara Ann Leach Earle, he had two children, [[Elisabeth Earle|Elisabeth Ashlea Earle]] and Charles Jason Earle. He also had one stepdaughter, Nikki Leigh Rowling, and three grandchildren.\n\n===Career as the District Attorney===\nThe Travis County District Attorney's office investigates and prosecutes crimes related to the operation of the Texas state government. Earle was elected as a Democrat in the city of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. He was, and his successor now is, the only Democrat with statewide prosecutorial authority. During his tenure, Earle prosecuted a variety of elected officials from both sides of the aisle, often dismissing accusations of partisanship by pointing out that prosecutions tend to focus on officials in power. He prosecuted Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox, a Democrat; United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican; and - in his most high-profile case - United States House Majority Leader, Congressman Tom Delay, a Republican. Mattox was acquitted by a jury, Hutchison's case was dismissed, and DeLay was found guilty of money laundering, but his case was later overturned on appeal by the Republican-dominated Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.<ref>https://www.statesman.com/news/20200405/breaking-former-travis-county-da-ronnie-earle-has-died</ref>\n\nWhile his high-profile prosecutions of elected officials garnered the most press attention, it was Earle's work in criminal justice reform that was his primary focus. He was an early champion of reforms that, in his words, were \u201cengaging the community in its own protection.\u201d Earle's innovations focused on crime prevention, alternative sentencing, victim advocacy, and the reintegration of former offenders into society. He spoke nationally on this work, and engaged in criminal justice reform efforts until his death. \n\nIn late 2007, Earle announced that he would not seek reelection to his post. His departure precipitated a race to fill his seat. Four Democrats, all employees of his office, ran for the seat. In the [[primary election]] held on March 4, 2008, no candidate received 50 percent of the vote. A [[runoff election]] was held between the top two finishers, and [[Rosemary Lehmberg]] \u2013 whom Earle had endorsed \u2013 won handily. She faced no Republican opponent in the general election. She took office in January 2009 and is the first woman district attorney in Travis County history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn 2010, Earle ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Texas, using the campaign to promote his criminal justice reform agenda.\n\n===Later Life===\nEarle retired in Austin and remained active in criminal justice reform efforts. He died in Austin, Texas on April 5, 2020 after a long illness.<ref>https://www.statesman.com/news/20200405/breaking-former-travis-county-da-ronnie-earle-has-died</ref>\n\n==Major Public Integrity Investigations Conducted by Earle==\nThrough the Travis County Public Integrity Unit, Earle prosecuted [[politician]]s, including [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]],  United States House Majority Leader [[Tom Delay]], Texas State Representative [[Mike Martin (politician)|Mike Martin]], and Texas Attorney General [[Jim Mattox]].<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2008-04-11/610888/</ref> Defendants often accused Earle of partisanship, which he dismissed by pointing out that the prosecuted those in power, and that the bulk of prosecutions during his career had been brought against fellow Democrats.\n\n===Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Yarbrough===\nIn 1978, Earle accused Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Yarbrough, a Democrat, of forgery, aggravated perjury, and failure to appear. \n\n===Travis County Commissioner Bob Honts===-\nIn 1979, he accused Travis County Commissioner Bob Honts, a Democrat, of official misconduct and bribery. Commissioner Honts pled guilty to a misdemeanor, \"misapplying county property\", in 1984. He was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine.\n\n===Texas State Senator Gene Jones===\nIn 1980, Earle accused Texas State Senator Eugene 'Gene' Jones, a Democrat from Houston, of using a state computer to prepare campaign mailings. Jones pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of official misconduct, paid $2,000 fine and $10,000 in restitution.\n\n===Indictment of State Rep. Mike Martin===\nOn July 31, 1981 during the First Called Session of the Sixty-seventh Texas Legislature, Republican Representative [[Mike Martin (politician)|Mike Martin]], a Republican then of [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], was shot in the left arm outside his trailer in Austin with 00-buckshot. Soon after the shooting, unidentified spokespeople from Earle's office released information to the ''Austin American Statesman'' that they felt Martin was telling inconsistent stories to the police. They claimed he first said he had no idea who did it; later he said it was a [[Satanism|Satanic cult]]; in the end, he accused his political enemies. \n\nMartin responded to the leaks by saying he was asked to give police all possibilities and said he had no idea why the district attorney's office would be saying such things. Earle personally made a public announcement that Martin was cooperating with police and that no one from his office was releasing information saying otherwise to ''The Statesman''. Earle formed a grand jury to look into the shooting of Martin and invited him to attend without issuing a subpoena.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nMartin refused to appear by issuing a statement that he had already given officials all the information he knew. Gregg County District Attorney Rob Foster shortly arrested Martin on a three-year-old [[assault]] charge. The charge was immediately dismissed due to time limits and lack of evidence. Upon release, Martin appeared before reporters and accused Gregg County officials of using their offices to ruin him politically. The day after his release on the assault charge, Martin voluntarily appeared before Earle's grand jury.\n\nAt the time he didn't know that his first cousin, Charles Goff, had previously appeared before the grand jury and admitted helping Martin stage the event to advance Martin's political career. He claimed Martin offered him a state job as payment, despite Texas' strong [[nepotism]] laws forbidding the hiring of relatives. Goff had served prison time and had three outstanding felony warrants pending at the time of his testimony; however, the grand jury took his word over Martin's. After Martin's denial of Goff's accusations before the grand jury, Earle filed felony perjury charges against the freshman legislator. Martin pleaded not guilty and, a year later, worked out a [[plea bargain]] with Earle by admitting to [[misdemeanor]] perjury charges relating to the renting of a car around the time of the shooting. Martin resigned his House seat on April 22, 1982 and withdrew from the upcoming election. Martin filed several suits against Earle, Foster, and Goff for civil rights violations. A federal judge dismissed the last case in June 1985 on grounds that prosecutors enjoy [[qualified immunity]] from [[civil lawsuit|civil suits]]. Martin maintains his innocence regarding Earle's charges.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Texas State Treasurer Warren G. Harding===\nIn 1981, Texas State Treasurer Warren G. Harding, a Democrat, pled guilty to class A misdemeanor of official misconduct. He received a one year deferred adjudication, paid a $2,000 fine, and paid $2,000 in restitution.\n\n===Texas Speaker of the House Gib Lewis===\nIn 1983, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Gib Lewis, a Democrat, pled guilty to a class B misdemeanor for failing to file his financial statement. He paid an $800 fine.\n\n===Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox===\nIn 1983, Earle accused then-Attorney General [[Jim Mattox]] of threatening Fulbright & Jaworski's municipal bond business unless one of their lawyers stopped trying to question his sister, Janice Mattox, about a bank loan. The loan was an issue in a lawsuit involving Mobil Oil Co. and [[Clinton Manges]], a South Texas oil man and rancher who financially supported Mattox, who was acquitted after a long trial.\n\n===San Antonio Voter Registrar Marco Gomez===\nIn 1983, San Antonio Voter Registrar Marco Gomez, a Democrat pled guilty to charges of \"securing execution of document by deception and tampering with a governmental record.\" He received 10 years probation, 90 days in the Travis County Jail, paid $49,994 in restitution, and paid a $2,000 fine.\n\n===Texas State Representative Charles Staniswallis===\nIn 1983, Texas State Representative Charles Staniswallis, A Republican, pled guilty to charges of theft and tampering with a governmental record. Staniswallis received 10 years probation, paid a $2,000 fine, and paid $8,976 in restitution.\n\n===Texas Speaker of the House Gib Lewis===\nIn 1992, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Gib Lewis, a Democrat, pled guilty to two counts of filing false financial statements. He paid a $1,000 fine on each count.\n\n===United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison===\nIn 1994, Earle filed charges against Senator [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]], a Republican then serving as [[Texas State Treasurer]], for tampering with physical evidence, tampering with a governmental record, and official misconduct. On the first day in court, following an evidentiary hearing in which it became clear that the judge would rule much of his evidence inadmissible, Earle attempted to drop the charges in order to regroup but the judge refused to allow it, [[directed verdict|instructing the jury]] to return a \"not guilty\" verdict so the [[double jeopardy|charge could not be brought]] against her again.<ref name=\"CSDeLay\"/> \n\n===Texas State Representative Betty Denton===\nIn 1995, Texas State Representative Betty Denton, a Democrat, pled guilty to misdemeanor charges of perjury. She received six months deferred adjudication and paid a $2,000 fine.\n\n===Lane Denton===\nIn 1995, Lane Denton, a Democrat and the executive director of the Department of Public Safety Officers' Assoc\u00adi\u00ada\u00adtion was found guilty of second degree theft (a felony) and misapplication of fiduciary property. He was ordered to pay $67,201 in restitution along with a $12,000 fine. Additionally, he was sentenced to 10 years of probation, 60 days in jail, and 240 hours of community service.\n\n===Texas State Representative Gilbert Serna===\nIn 2000, Texas State Representative Gilbert Serna, a Democrat, pled guilty to multiple charges of theft by public servant. He was placed on probation for 10 years, was sentenced to 90 days in jail, and was required to pay a $3,000 fine along with restitution of more than $13,000.\n===Investigation and Indictment of Tom DeLay===\nFor over two years, Earle and eight separate grand juries investigated possible violations of Texas campaign finance law in the 2002 state legislative election. Earle denies that his pursuit of DeLay was part of a partisan \"[[fishing expedition]]\". His investigation of two political action committees that spent a combined $3.4 million on 22 Republican Texas House races focused on a [[political action committee]] founded by DeLay, (Texans for a Republican Majority PAC). During the investigation, DeLay charged that Earle was a \"runaway district attorney\" with \"a long history of being vindictive and partisan\". On September 28, 2005, a grand jury indicted DeLay for conspiring to violate Texas state election law. Texas prohibits corporate contributions in state legislative races. The indictment charged that [[Texans for a Republican Majority]], DeLay's PAC, accepted corporate contributions, [[money laundering|laundered the money]] through the [[Republican National Committee]], and directed it to favored Republican candidates in Texas. The presiding judge in the case, [[Pat Priest (judge)|Pat Priest]], a Democrat, eventually threw out the charge and the Court of Criminals Appeals upheld this decision in 2007.<ref name=\"court throws out DeLay charge\">{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/legislature/entries/2007/06/27/high_court_upholds_dismissal_of_indictment_against_delay.html|title=High Court Upholds Dismissal of Indictment Against DeLay|publisher=[[Austin American Statesman]]|date=June 27, 2007|first=Laylan|last=Copelin|accessdate=2008-07-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830004330/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/legislature/entries/2007/06/27/high_court_upholds_dismissal_of_indictment_against_delay.html|archivedate=August 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nEarle's second attempt to secure indictments against DeLay failed. That grand jury returned a \"no bill\" due to insufficient evidence.

DeLay's lawyers asserted the indictment was flawed legally, as laundered money is defined in the Texas Penal Code as money gained in the ''\"proceeds of criminal activity\"''. DeLay's defense stressed that corporate donations to political campaigns are a normal, legal business activity. Due to a House rule requiring a party leader to step down if indicted, the indictment required DeLay to resign as Majority Leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/2005/10/03/criminalizing_politics/page/full|last=Novak|first=Robert|title=Criminalizing politics|work=Townhall Magazine|date=October 3, 2005|accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref> In a counter complaint, DeLay's attorney, [[Dick DeGuerin]], filed a motion against DA Earle, charging him with [[prosecutorial misconduct]] in the DeLay indictment.

The motion was denied by Judge Priest and a trial date for October 2010 was set. On November 24, 2010, DeLay was convicted of [[money laundering]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/24/jury-convicts-delay-money-laundering-trial.html|title=Tom DeLay Convicted of Money Laundering|date=2010-11-24|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-04-04|agency=Associated Press|language=en-US}}</ref> The conviction was overturned by the Republican-dominated Third Court of Appeals for the State of Texas in September 2013.

Earle's evidence rested on an alleged confession by Murray, obtained by interrogation at a children's shelter in the absence of any attorney or family member. Murray's case provoked several public protests of Earle's office and at the Texas State Capitol from her detention in 1996 until her release in 1999, when the case was reviewed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2003-12-12/naked-city/|title=Naked City: Lacresha Murray suit proceeds|last=Smith|first=Jordan|date=2003-12-12|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nMurray was again tried and convicted of intentional injury to a child, receiving a 25-year sentence. In 2001, the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals reversed and remanded her sentence after finding that her confession was illegally obtained. Furthermore, a liver tissue examination by a pathologist expert in the field showed that the injury was inflicted hours before and thus not by Murray; and clothes worn by the toddler had no blood traces that were inevitable given the injuries\u2014indicating the clothes were changed after the toddler was beaten.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2000-11-03/79252/|title=Naked City: Murray's Law|last=Smith|first=Amy|date=2000-11-03|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFaced with the evidence Earle eventually dropped all charges against Murray. In 2002, a suit was filed against the Travis County District Attorney's Office and a host of other individuals and various agencies, which alleged the Murray family had been victimized by [[malicious prosecution]], [[defamation]], [[libel]] and [[slander]], and had suffered mental anguish. Charges of racism were also raised in the suit, suggesting that the Murray family would have been treated differently had they been white. Murray's suit was dismissed; on November 28, 2005, the [[US Supreme Court]] refused to revive the lawsuit.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Maurice Pierce Case===\nOn December 6, 1991, four teenage girls were murdered inside a local yogurt shop in Austin. In 1999, Earle led the \"[[Yogurt Shop Murders]]\" case against suspect Maurice Pierce, leading to a grand jury indicting him on four counts of first degree murder. Pierce was arrested, along with Robert Springsteen IV, Michael Scott, and Forrest Welborn, for the murders of four girls. Springsteen and Scott eventually confessed to the crime. Springsteen was convicted and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]]. Scott was convicted and sentenced to [[life in prison]].\n\nWelborn was never indicted for the crime. Pierce continually maintained his innocence up until his release, occurring three years after his arrest. The state could not use Springsteen's and Scott's confessions against Pierce, so, without a confession, and only circumstantial evidence to connect him to the yogurt shop, the state had to either try Pierce or release him. Earle released him and dropped all charges citing a lack of evidence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2003-02-07/144295/|title=Pierce Freed After Three Years: \"Godspeed\"|last=Smith|first=Jordan|date=2003-02-07|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref> The case against Pierce remains open.

He became nationally known for filing charges against [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House majority leader]] [[Tom DeLay]] in September 2005 for [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiring]] to violate [[Texas]]' [[election law]] and/or to [[money laundering|launder]] money. In Texas, Earle was known for his criminal justice reform efforts which focused on crime prevention, alternative sentencing, victim advocacy, and the reintegration of former offenders into society. In 1983, Earle - an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] - prosecuted ''himself'' for an election law [[Offense (law)|violation]] after missing a [[campaign finance]] filing deadline by one day; he was fined $212.<ref name=\"CSDeLay\">{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1203/p01s04-usgn.html|title=The Texas DA pitted against the power of Tom DeLay|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=December 3, 2004|first=Kris|last=Axtman|accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref> Earle was a fixture in Travis County politics and served in public office there for more than 30 years, joking that he was asked if he was the \"District Eternity\".<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2020-04-06/former-travis-county-d-a-ronnie-earle-dies/</ref> \n\nEarle spoke extensively on his belief that the law guided public responses to crime but that it was society's collective \"ethics infrastructure\" that required support to deliver a safer, more just, and more livable community. This belief guided him, as he told the [[Austin Chronicle]] in 2008,  \"It really informs everything I've tried to do \u2013 well, not everything, but most of the things I've tried to do as district attorney, especially the most progressive and innovative things that we have done in this office. And the reason is because the law doesn't teach you how to act. ... What I have come to call the 'ethics infrastructure' teaches you how to act. And that is in that work of mommas and daddies and aunts and uncles and teachers and preachers and neighbors and cousins and friends \u2013 that's where you learn how to act, not from the law.\"<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2008-04-11/610887/</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early Life===\nEarle was born in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] and raised on a [[cattle]] [[ranching|ranch]] in [[Birdville, Texas]].<ref name=\"CSDeLay\" /> He achieved the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], earned money working as a [[lifeguard]], played [[American football|football]], and was president of his high school student council.<ref name=\"CSDeLay\" /><ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.salon.com/2005/11/12/earle_8/ | title = Earle's last stand | date = November 13, 2005 | first1 = Rob | last1 = Patterson | work = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] | via = www.salon.com | access-date = June 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEarle moved to Austin when he was 19 to attend the college at the [[University of Texas]] and law school at the [[University of Texas School of Law]]. In 1967, while a law student, he went to work in the office of Texas Governor [[John Connally]].<ref>\nDistrict Eternity - Ronnie Earle on Ronnie Earle - Austin Chronicle - https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2008-04-11/610887/</ref> After graduating from law school,{{cn|date=June 2019}} he was appointed and served as a municipal judge in that city from 1969 to 1972.

He faced opponents only twice during his unprecedented tenure.<ref>Austin American-Statesman - \"Former Travis County DA Ronnie Earle has died\" - https://www.statesman.com/news/20200405/breaking-former-travis-county-da-ronnie-earle-has-died</ref>\n\nEarle was married to his second wife, Twila Hugley Earle, for nearly three decades. With his first wife, Barbara Ann Leach Earle, he had two children, [[Elisabeth Earle|Elisabeth Ashlea Earle]] and Charles Jason Earle. He also had one stepdaughter, Nikki Leigh Rowling, and three grandchildren.\n\n===Career as the District Attorney===\nThe Travis County District Attorney's office investigates and prosecutes crimes related to the operation of the Texas state government. Earle was elected as a Democrat in the city of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. He was, and his successor now is, the only Democrat with statewide prosecutorial authority. During his tenure, Earle prosecuted a variety of elected officials from both sides of the aisle, often dismissing accusations of partisanship by pointing out that prosecutions tend to focus on officials in power. He prosecuted Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox, a Democrat; United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican; and - in his most high-profile case - United States House Majority Leader, Congressman Tom Delay, a Republican. Mattox was acquitted by a jury, Hutchison's case was dismissed, and DeLay was found guilty of money laundering, but his case was later overturned on appeal by the Republican-dominated Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.<ref>https://www.statesman.com/news/20200405/breaking-former-travis-county-da-ronnie-earle-has-died</ref>\n\nWhile his high-profile prosecutions of elected officials garnered the most press attention, it was Earle's work in criminal justice reform that was his primary focus. He was an early champion of reforms that, in his words, were \u201cengaging the community in its own protection.\u201d Earle's innovations focused on crime prevention, alternative sentencing, victim advocacy, and the reintegration of former offenders into society. He spoke nationally on this work, and engaged in criminal justice reform efforts until his death. \n\nIn late 2007, Earle announced that he would not seek reelection to his post. His departure precipitated a race to fill his seat. Four Democrats, all employees of his office, ran for the seat. In the [[primary election]] held on March 4, 2008, no candidate received 50 percent of the vote. A [[runoff election]] was held between the top two finishers, and [[Rosemary Lehmberg]] \u2013 whom Earle had endorsed \u2013 won handily. She faced no Republican opponent in the general election. She took office in January 2009 and is the first woman district attorney in Travis County history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn 2010, Earle ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Texas, using the campaign to promote his criminal justice reform agenda.\n\n===Later Life===\nEarle retired in Austin and remained active in criminal justice reform efforts. He died in Austin, Texas on April 5, 2020 after a long illness.<ref>https://www.statesman.com/news/20200405/breaking-former-travis-county-da-ronnie-earle-has-died</ref>\n\n==Major Public Integrity Investigations Conducted by Earle==\nThrough the Travis County Public Integrity Unit, Earle prosecuted [[politician]]s, including [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]],  United States House Majority Leader [[Tom Delay]], Texas State Representative [[Mike Martin (politician)|Mike Martin]], and Texas Attorney General [[Jim Mattox]].<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2008-04-11/610888/</ref> Defendants often accused Earle of partisanship, which he dismissed by pointing out that the prosecuted those in power, and that the bulk of prosecutions during his career had been brought against fellow Democrats.\n\n===Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Yarbrough===\nIn 1978, Earle accused Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Yarbrough, a Democrat, of forgery, aggravated perjury, and failure to appear. \n\n===Travis County Commissioner Bob Honts===-\nIn 1979, he accused Travis County Commissioner Bob Honts, a Democrat, of official misconduct and bribery. Commissioner Honts pled guilty to a misdemeanor, \"misapplying county property\", in 1984. He was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine.\n\n===Texas State Senator Gene Jones===\nIn 1980, Earle accused Texas State Senator Eugene 'Gene' Jones, a Democrat from Houston, of using a state computer to prepare campaign mailings. Jones pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of official misconduct, paid $2,000 fine and $10,000 in restitution.\n\n===Indictment of State Rep. Mike Martin===\nOn July 31, 1981 during the First Called Session of the Sixty-seventh Texas Legislature, Republican Representative [[Mike Martin (politician)|Mike Martin]], a Republican then of [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], was shot in the left arm outside his trailer in Austin with 00-buckshot. Soon after the shooting, unidentified spokespeople from Earle's office released information to the ''Austin American Statesman'' that they felt Martin was telling inconsistent stories to the police. They claimed he first said he had no idea who did it; later he said it was a [[Satanism|Satanic cult]]; in the end, he accused his political enemies. \n\nMartin responded to the leaks by saying he was asked to give police all possibilities and said he had no idea why the district attorney's office would be saying such things. Earle personally made a public announcement that Martin was cooperating with police and that no one from his office was releasing information saying otherwise to ''The Statesman''. Earle formed a grand jury to look into the shooting of Martin and invited him to attend without issuing a subpoena.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nMartin refused to appear by issuing a statement that he had already given officials all the information he knew. Gregg County District Attorney Rob Foster shortly arrested Martin on a three-year-old [[assault]] charge. The charge was immediately dismissed due to time limits and lack of evidence. Upon release, Martin appeared before reporters and accused Gregg County officials of using their offices to ruin him politically. The day after his release on the assault charge, Martin voluntarily appeared before Earle's grand jury.\n\nAt the time he didn't know that his first cousin, Charles Goff, had previously appeared before the grand jury and admitted helping Martin stage the event to advance Martin's political career. He claimed Martin offered him a state job as payment, despite Texas' strong [[nepotism]] laws forbidding the hiring of relatives. Goff had served prison time and had three outstanding felony warrants pending at the time of his testimony; however, the grand jury took his word over Martin's. After Martin's denial of Goff's accusations before the grand jury, Earle filed felony perjury charges against the freshman legislator. Martin pleaded not guilty and, a year later, worked out a [[plea bargain]] with Earle by admitting to [[misdemeanor]] perjury charges relating to the renting of a car around the time of the shooting. Martin resigned his House seat on April 22, 1982 and withdrew from the upcoming election. Martin filed several suits against Earle, Foster, and Goff for civil rights violations. A federal judge dismissed the last case in June 1985 on grounds that prosecutors enjoy [[qualified immunity]] from [[civil lawsuit|civil suits]]. Martin maintains his innocence regarding Earle's charges.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Texas State Treasurer Warren G. Harding===\nIn 1981, Texas State Treasurer Warren G. Harding, a Democrat, pled guilty to class A misdemeanor of official misconduct. He received a one year deferred adjudication, paid a $2,000 fine, and paid $2,000 in restitution.\n\n===Texas Speaker of the House Gib Lewis===\nIn 1983, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Gib Lewis, a Democrat, pled guilty to a class B misdemeanor for failing to file his financial statement. He paid an $800 fine.\n\n===Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox===\nIn 1983, Earle accused then-Attorney General [[Jim Mattox]] of threatening Fulbright & Jaworski's municipal bond business unless one of their lawyers stopped trying to question his sister, Janice Mattox, about a bank loan. The loan was an issue in a lawsuit involving Mobil Oil Co. and [[Clinton Manges]], a South Texas oil man and rancher who financially supported Mattox, who was acquitted after a long trial.\n\n===San Antonio Voter Registrar Marco Gomez===\nIn 1983, San Antonio Voter Registrar Marco Gomez, a Democrat pled guilty to charges of \"securing execution of document by deception and tampering with a governmental record.\" He received 10 years probation, 90 days in the Travis County Jail, paid $49,994 in restitution, and paid a $2,000 fine.\n\n===Texas State Representative Charles Staniswallis===\nIn 1983, Texas State Representative Charles Staniswallis, A Republican, pled guilty to charges of theft and tampering with a governmental record. Staniswallis received 10 years probation, paid a $2,000 fine, and paid $8,976 in restitution.\n\n===Texas Speaker of the House Gib Lewis===\nIn 1992, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Gib Lewis, a Democrat, pled guilty to two counts of filing false financial statements. He paid a $1,000 fine on each count.\n\n===United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison===\nIn 1994, Earle filed charges against Senator [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]], a Republican then serving as [[Texas State Treasurer]], for tampering with physical evidence, tampering with a governmental record, and official misconduct. On the first day in court, following an evidentiary hearing in which it became clear that the judge would rule much of his evidence inadmissible, Earle attempted to drop the charges in order to regroup but the judge refused to allow it, [[directed verdict|instructing the jury]] to return a \"not guilty\" verdict so the [[double jeopardy|charge could not be brought]] against her again.<ref name=\"CSDeLay\"/> \n\n===Texas State Representative Betty Denton===\nIn 1995, Texas State Representative Betty Denton, a Democrat, pled guilty to misdemeanor charges of perjury. She received six months deferred adjudication and paid a $2,000 fine.\n\n===Lane Denton===\nIn 1995, Lane Denton, a Democrat and the executive director of the Department of Public Safety Officers' Assoc\u00adi\u00ada\u00adtion was found guilty of second degree theft (a felony) and misapplication of fiduciary property. He was ordered to pay $67,201 in restitution along with a $12,000 fine. Additionally, he was sentenced to 10 years of probation, 60 days in jail, and 240 hours of community service.\n\n===Texas State Representative Gilbert Serna===\nIn 2000, Texas State Representative Gilbert Serna, a Democrat, pled guilty to multiple charges of theft by public servant. He was placed on probation for 10 years, was sentenced to 90 days in jail, and was required to pay a $3,000 fine along with restitution of more than $13,000.\n===Investigation and Indictment of Tom DeLay===\nFor over two years, Earle and eight separate grand juries investigated possible violations of Texas campaign finance law in the 2002 state legislative election. Earle denies that his pursuit of DeLay was part of a partisan \"[[fishing expedition]]\". His investigation of two political action committees that spent a combined $3.4 million on 22 Republican Texas House races focused on a [[political action committee]] founded by DeLay, (Texans for a Republican Majority PAC). During the investigation, DeLay charged that Earle was a \"runaway district attorney\" with \"a long history of being vindictive and partisan\". On September 28, 2005, a grand jury indicted DeLay for conspiring to violate Texas state election law. Texas prohibits corporate contributions in state legislative races. The indictment charged that [[Texans for a Republican Majority]], DeLay's PAC, accepted corporate contributions, [[money laundering|laundered the money]] through the [[Republican National Committee]], and directed it to favored Republican candidates in Texas. The presiding judge in the case, [[Pat Priest (judge)|Pat Priest]], a Democrat, eventually threw out the charge and the Court of Criminals Appeals upheld this decision in 2007.<ref name=\"court throws out DeLay charge\">{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/legislature/entries/2007/06/27/high_court_upholds_dismissal_of_indictment_against_delay.html|title=High Court Upholds Dismissal of Indictment Against DeLay|publisher=[[Austin American Statesman]]|date=June 27, 2007|first=Laylan|last=Copelin|accessdate=2008-07-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830004330/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/legislature/entries/2007/06/27/high_court_upholds_dismissal_of_indictment_against_delay.html|archivedate=August 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nEarle's second attempt to secure indictments against DeLay failed. That grand jury returned a \"no bill\" due to insufficient evidence.

DeLay's lawyers asserted the indictment was flawed legally, as laundered money is defined in the Texas Penal Code as money gained in the ''\"proceeds of criminal activity\"''. DeLay's defense stressed that corporate donations to political campaigns are a normal, legal business activity. Due to a House rule requiring a party leader to step down if indicted, the indictment required DeLay to resign as Majority Leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/2005/10/03/criminalizing_politics/page/full|last=Novak|first=Robert|title=Criminalizing politics|work=Townhall Magazine|date=October 3, 2005|accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref> In a counter complaint, DeLay's attorney, [[Dick DeGuerin]], filed a motion against DA Earle, charging him with [[prosecutorial misconduct]] in the DeLay indictment.

Earle's evidence rested on an alleged confession by Murray, obtained by interrogation at a children's shelter in the absence of any attorney or family member. Murray's case provoked several public protests of Earle's office and at the Texas State Capitol from her detention in 1996 until her release in 1999, when the case was reviewed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2003-12-12/naked-city/|title=Naked City: Lacresha Murray suit proceeds|last=Smith|first=Jordan|date=2003-12-12|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nMurray was again tried and convicted of intentional injury to a child, receiving a 25-year sentence. In 2001, the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals reversed and remanded her sentence after finding that her confession was illegally obtained. Furthermore, a liver tissue examination by a pathologist expert in the field showed that the injury was inflicted hours before and thus not by Murray; and clothes worn by the toddler had no blood traces that were inevitable given the injuries\u2014indicating the clothes were changed after the toddler was beaten.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2000-11-03/79252/|title=Naked City: Murray's Law|last=Smith|first=Amy|date=2000-11-03|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFaced with the evidence Earle eventually dropped all charges against Murray. In 2002, a suit was filed against the Travis County District Attorney's Office and a host of other individuals and various agencies, which alleged the Murray family had been victimized by [[malicious prosecution]], [[defamation]], [[libel]] and [[slander]], and had suffered mental anguish. Charges of racism were also raised in the suit, suggesting that the Murray family would have been treated differently had they been white. Murray's suit was dismissed; on November 28, 2005, the [[US Supreme Court]] refused to revive the lawsuit.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Maurice Pierce Case===\nOn December 6, 1991, four teenage girls were murdered inside a local yogurt shop in Austin. In 1999, Earle led the \"[[Yogurt Shop Murders]]\" case against suspect Maurice Pierce, leading to a grand jury indicting him on four counts of first degree murder. Pierce was arrested, along with Robert Springsteen IV, Michael Scott, and Forrest Welborn, for the murders of four girls. Springsteen and Scott eventually confessed to the crime. Springsteen was convicted and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]]. Scott was convicted and sentenced to [[life in prison]].\n\nWelborn was never indicted for the crime. Pierce continually maintained his innocence up until his release, occurring three years after his arrest.

The terrain is mountainous and inaccessible (until recently many Mani villages could be accessed only by sea), and the regional name \"Mani\" is thought to have meant originally \"dry\" or \"barren\". The name \"Maniot\" is a derivative meaning \"of Mani\". In the [[early modern period]], Maniots had a reputation as fierce and proudly independent [[warrior]]s, who practiced [[piracy]] and fierce [[Feud#Blood feuds/vendetta|blood feuds]].

Even though the Romans conquered the Peloponnese, the Koinon was allowed to retain its independence. The Maniots suffered from pirate raids by Cretans and [[Cilicia]]ns who plundered Mani and pillaged the temple of [[Poseidon]]. The Maniots were delivered from the pirates when [[Pompey the Great]] defeated them. Most probably in gratitude, the Maniots supplied Pompey with archers in his battles against [[Julius Caesar]] during [[Caesar's civil war]] (49\u201345 BC) and were defeated.<ref name=\"Kassis16\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=16}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Civil war between Antony and Octavian]] (32\u201330 BC), the Maniots and the rest of the Laconians supplied [[Augustus]] with troops for his confrontation with [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] (September 2, 31 BC) and in gratitude they officially recognized Augustus as Emperor and invited him at [[Psamathous]] (near modern [[Porto Kagio]]), and their Koinon stayed an independent state.

However, many parts of Mani remained under the also semi-independent (autonomous under Roman sovereignty) Sparta, the most notable being Asine and Kardamyli.<ref name=\"Kassis16\"/> Mani became a center for purple dye, which was popular in [[Rome]], as well as being well known for its rose antique marble and [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]].<ref name=\"Fermor\"/> Las is recorded to have been a comfortable city with Roman baths and a gymnasium.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos49\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=49}}.</ref>\n\n[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has left us a description of Gythium as it existed during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (reigned 161\u2013180).

His eldest son, [[Arcadius]], succeeded him in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], while his younger son, [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], received the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The Roman Empire had divided for the last time, and Mani became part of the Eastern or [[Byzantine Empire]].

The Maniots at that time were called \"Hellenes\"\u2014that is, [[paganism|pagans]] (see [[Names of the Greeks]])\u2014and were only [[Christianization|Christianized]] fully in the 9th century AD, though some church ruins from the 4th century AD indicate that [[Christianity]] was practiced by some Maniots in the region at an earlier time. The Maniots were the last inhabitants of Greece to openly follow the pagan [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] religion. This can be explained by the mountainous nature of Mani's terrain, which enabled them to escape the attempts of the Eastern Roman Empire to Christianize Greece by force.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22\"/>\n\n===Under the Principality of Achaea===\n[[File:Armoiries Acha\u00efe.svg|thumb|left|100px|Coat of Arms of the [[Principality of Achaea]].]]\n\nDuring the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1201\u20131204), the Crusaders captured [[Constantinople]]. The Eastern Roman Empire was partitioned between several Greek and Latin successor states, notably including (from west to east) the [[Despotate of Epirus]], the [[Latin Empire]], the [[Empire of Nicaea]], and the [[Empire of Trebizond]]. These four empires produced rival emperors, struggling for control over each other and the rest of the semi-independent states emerging in the area. [[William of Champlitte]] and [[Geoffrey I Villehardouin]] defeated the Peloponnesian Greeks at the [[Battle of the Olive Grove of Koundouros]] (1205), and the Peloponnese became the [[Principality of Achaea]]. In 1210, Mani was given to Baron Jean de Neuilly as Hereditary Marshal, and he built the castle of [[Passavas]] on the ruins of [[Las (Greece)|Las]]. The castle occupied a significant position, as it controlled an important pass from Gythium to [[Oitylo]] and contained the Maniots.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos23\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=23}}.</ref><ref name=\"Kassis23\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=23}}.</ref>\n\nThe Maniots, however, were not easily contained, and they were not the only threat to the Frankish occupation of the Peloponnese. The [[Melingoi|Melengi]], a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribe in the [[Taygetus]] [[mountain range]], raided Laconia from the west, and the [[Tsakonians]] also resisted the Franks. In 1249, the new prince, [[William II of Villehardouin]], acted against the raiders. He used the newly captured fortress of [[Monemvasia]] to keep the Tsakonians at bay, and he built the castle at [[Mystras]] in the Taygetus mountains overlooking Sparta in order to contain the Melengi. To stop the Maniot raids, he built the castle of [[Megali Maina]], which is most probably [[Tigani]]. It is described as ''at a fearful cliff with a headland above''. A Latin bishop was appointed for Mani during the 1250s. In 1259, the bishop was captured during the [[Battle of Pelagonia]] by the renewed Byzantine Empire under the leadership of Nicaea.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=24}}.</ref>\n\n===Under the Despotate of Morea===\n[[File:Despotate of Morea 1450.svg|thumb|[[Despotate of Morea]], c. 1450.]]\n\nOn July 25, 1261, the Byzantines under [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] recaptured Constantinople. Prince William was set free, on the condition that he had to surrender the fortresses of Megali Maina, Mystras, [[Geronthrae]] and Monemvasia, as well as surrender hostages including [[Lady Margaret, Baroness of Passavas]]. With the Franks gone from Laconia, the Maniots lived in peace under the [[Despotate of Morea]], whose successive [[Despotes]] governed the province. Mani seems to have been dominated by the Nikliani family, who were refugees. However, the peace was terminated when the Ottoman Turks started their attacks on the Peloponnese.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24\"/>{{refn|group=Note|name=cnote\u03b1|In the second period of Byzantine rule over Mani, there were four social castes, the Nikliani, the Megalogenites, the Achamnomeri and the Fameyi.

They had the right to build only one-storey towers and they were not allowed to build towers out of limestone or marble.

In May 1460, Mehmet occupied the Peloponnese. The Despotate of Morea had been ruled by the two brothers of [[Constantine XI]], who had died defending Constantinople. However, neither [[Demetrios Palaiologos]] nor [[Thomas Palaiologos]] chose to follow his example and defend the Peloponnese.

He succeeded in ravaging Mani and imposing taxes on the Maniots (which they did not pay). This caused Nevers to move more actively for his crusade. Nevers sent envoys to the courts of Europe looking for support.

The Maniots supported the Venetians by offering them ships. In 1659, Admiral [[Francesco Morosini]], with 13,000 Maniots as his allies, occupied [[Kalamata]], a large city near Mani. In 1667, during the [[Siege of Candia]], some Maniot pirate ships sneaked into the Ottoman fleet and managed to loot and burn some ships.

On March 23, they captured the city.<ref name=\"Kassis39\"/> From Kalamata, Mavromichalis wrote letters to the states of [[Europe]], informing them of what the Greeks were doing and signing them as \"Commander in Chief of the Spartan Forces\". The Messenian Senate was also held in Kalamata. Kolokotronis wanted to attack [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]] and capture the main Turkish city in the Peloponnese. However, Mavromichalis wanted to capture the smaller towns first and then take [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. The Senate agreed with Mavromichalis, and the Maniots attacked the Turks of Messenia and Laconia.<ref name=\"Paroulakis58\">{{harvnb|Paroulakis|1984|p=58}}.</ref>{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}}\n\nKolokotronis, convinced that he was correct, moved into [[Arcadia]] with 300 Maniots.

On September 12, 1821, the Turkish capital in the Peloponnese fell. On July 4 1822, [[Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis (military commander)|Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis]], Petros Mavromichalis' younger brother, was killed in [[Ammoudia, Preveza|Splantza]], near the [[Souli]]ote fortress of Kiafa. \n\n[[Mahmud II]] became desperate and during 1824 called on his [[Viceroy]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], to aid him to attack Mani. Ali promised to aid him in return for the islands of [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]], as well as making his eldest son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]], pasha of the [[Peloponnese]]. Mahmud II accepted the offer and Ali sent his son in command of the expedition. Meanwhile, the Greeks were in disarray because of political rivalries, which caused a civil war. Kolokotronis was arrested, his son [[Panos Kolokotronis|Panos]] was killed, and his nephew [[Nikitaras]] fled.<ref name=\"Paroulakis113\">{{harvnb|Paroulakis|1984|p=113}}.</ref>{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}}\n\nIbrahim made good use of this turmoil and landed with his army (25-30,000 infantry, cavalry and artillery supported by the Ottoman-Egyptian fleet) at [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]. Ibrahim soon had recaptured the Peloponnese except for [[Nafplio]] and Mani.

He sent an envoy to the Maniots demanding that they surrender or else he would ravage their land. Instead of surrendering, the Maniots replied:<ref name=\"Kassis39\"/>\n\n''From the few Greeks of Mani and the rest of Greeks who live there to Ibrahim Pasha. We received your letter in which you try to frighten us saying that if we don't surrender, you'll kill the Maniots and plunder Mani. That's why we are waiting for you and your army. We, the inhabitants of Mani, sign and await you.''\n\nEnraged by the Spartan reply, Ibrahim, commanding an army of 7,000 men, attacked Mani on June 21, 1826.<ref name=\"Kassis40\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=40}}.</ref> He was stopped at the walls of Almiros and Verga, which ran for around 500 meters.<ref>{{harvnb|Saitas|1990|p=12}}.</ref> Defending the walls were 2,000 Maniots under the command of Ilias Mavromichalis (Katsakos) and 500 Greek refugees.<ref name=\"Kassis40\"/><ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=62}}.</ref> As Ibrahim moved his infantry and cavalry against the Maniot position, he also ordered two of his ships, including the one he was on, to attack the Maniot fortifications from the sea with their artillery.

This plan was described by Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos as \"excellent\" because it would catch Areopoli by surprise since it was ill defended. By capturing Areopoli, Ibrahim could disrupt the Maniot communication lines and control the mountain passes that led to [[Gytheio]]. This would also allow the Egyptians to attack the Maniots at Verga from the rear.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62\"/>\n\nOn June 24, Ibrahim sent a small fleet carrying 1,500 troops to land at the Bay of Diros and capture Areopoli.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62\"/> As the Egyptians landed on the beach, the alarm bells rang.<ref name=\"Kassis40\"/> Soon, 300 women and old men who had been harvesting the crops gathered and, armed only with their scythes and cudgels, charged at the Egyptians. The Egyptians, not expecting any resistance, were caught by surprise at this sudden attack and were forced to retreat to a fortified position on the beach where they could receive support from their ships. Eventually, 300 Maniots arrived from other towns, and the Egyptians were forced to either swim to their ships or be slain.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62\"/> Not only was Ibrahim's defeat costly, as he lost 1,000 men, but his plan to invade and conquer Mani was utterly ruined. Later on, the women of Diros were dubbed the 'Amazons of Diros'.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos63\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=63}}.</ref>\n\nIbrahim, annoyed by his defeats at Verga and Diros, plundered the Peloponnese for a month before turning his attention back to Mani. He sent an army of 6,000 Arabs to advance to the Taygetus and capture Gytheio and Laconian Mani. In command of the army was a Greek traitor from the village of [[Vordonia]], called Bosinas. As he advanced towards Polytsaravos (nowadays a deserted place in the southern part of [[Taygetus]]), he was stopped by Theodoros Stathakos, who together with his family of thirteen people was waiting in their tower. Bosinas tried to make Stathakos surrender, and when the latter feigned surrender, Bosinas came towards the tower. However, once Bosinas was within range, Stathakos and his small band killed him. In retaliation, Bosinas' army shot at the tower with their cannons and destroyed it.<ref name=\"Kassis41\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=41}}.</ref>\n\nThe Egyptians then proceeded towards the town of Polytsaravos and reached it on August 28. The inhabitants of the town had sent the women and children to take refuge in the mountains before improving the fortifications they had there. The town militia was reinforced by other Maniots, and soon the defenders numbered 2,500 men.<ref name=\"Kassis41\"/> The Egyptians had trouble advancing to Polytsaravos, because it was surrounded by rocks situated on high ground.<ref name=\"Barrow102\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=102}}.</ref> As soon as the Arabs arrived, the Maniots rallied around their fortifications and attacked the Arabs. The Arabs retreated from Polytsaravos after sustaining 400 casualties while the Maniots only suffered nine.<ref name=\"Kassis41\"/> Even though this campaign is overshadowed by other battles of the revolution, it was one of the most important, according to Maniot regional historians. The Maniots stopped the Egyptians and Ibrahim Pasha who had not been defeated this decisively before. This was the last invasion of Mani by the Egyptians or the Ottomans, as the Peloponnese, central Greece, and some of the Aegean islands were liberated in 1828 after the naval forces of [[Bourbon Restoration]] France under [[Henri de Rigny]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] under [[Edward Codrington]], and the [[Russian Empire]] under [[Login Geiden]] defeated Ibrahim at the [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]] in 1827.\n\n===Republic and Regency===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Petrobey Mavromichalis1.jpg\n| width1 = 130\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Kapodistrias2.jpg\n| width2 = 105\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The imprisonment of [[Petros Mavromichalis]] (left) by [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] (right) led to the assassination of Kapodistrias.\n}}\n\nIn 1831, [[Ioannis Capodistrias]] became governor of Greece.<ref name=\"Kassis41\"/> Capodistrias quarreled with the Mavromichalis clan because the Maniots refused to pay taxes to the new government.<ref name=\"Paroulakis165\">{{harvnb|Paroulakis|1984|p=165}}.</ref>{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}} Capodistrias requested that [[Tzanis Mavromichalis|Tzanis]], Petros' brother, go to [[Nafplio]], then capital of Greece, and negotiate. As soon as Tzanis arrived, he was arrested and imprisoned. Capodistrias then sent soldiers to Mani and had Petros arrested, imprisoned, and charged with [[high treason]]. His brother Konstantinos, the defender of Nafplio, and Petros' son, [[Georgios Mavromichalis]], were put under house arrest in the capital.<ref name=\"Paroulakis168\">{{harvnb|Paroulakis|1984|p=168}}.</ref>{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}}\n\nOn September 27, 1831 (October 9 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]), Capodistrias went to attend a church service at the Church of Saint Spyridon. He noticed that Konstantinos and Georgios were waiting at the church doors. As he passed them, he briefly stopped before proceeding into the church. As he was about to step into the church, Konstantinos used his gun and the bullet hit Capodistrias at the back of the head while at the same time Georgios stabbed him through the heart. Capodistrias collapsed into the arms of his attendants. Capodistrias' bodyguard shot Konstantinos as he was running, and Konstantinos was hit by several more bullets before he died. Kostantinos' body was then dragged by an angry mob, who threw it into the sea. Georgios was captured and executed on the island of Bourzi, off the coast of Nafplio, while his father watched.<ref name=\"Paroulakis168\"/>\n\nIn 1833, [[Otto of Greece|Otto von Wittelsbach]], a son of [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, became [[King of Greece]] after he was appointed by the [[Great Powers]]. Since he was underage, he had a Council of Regency headed by [[Josef Ludwig von Armansperg]] governing the country for him.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos58\"/> One of the Council's first acts was to try to subdue the unruly Maniots and pull down their towers; another was to free Petros and Tzanis from their prisons.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos35\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=35}}.</ref> The council sent an army of [[Bavarians]] in order to tame Messa Mani.<ref name=\"Kassis43\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=43}}.</ref> They made it to [[Areopoli]], but during the night the Maniots surrounded and captured them, forcing them to leave the area.<ref name=\"Kassis44\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=44}}.</ref>\n\nOn May 14, 1834, four companies of Bavarian troops, assisted by four cannons, besieged the town of [[Petrovouni, Messenia|Petrovouni]]. Ultimately, 800 Maniots from the surrounding towns attacked the Bavarians. The Bavarians were massacred as most of them were either slain by the Maniots or fell into a ravine near the town while escaping. Later that year, an army of 6,000 men with five cannons under the command of General [[Christian von Schmaltz]], assisted by five squadrons of royalist Maniots, once again besieged Petrovouni. When news of an army of 1,000 Maniots was approaching, they retreated to Gytheio.<ref name=\"Kassis44\"/>\n\nThe Council decided that they could not subdue the Maniots by force, so they decided to send a diplomat, Max Feder, with the intention of subduing Mani by playing the love of money against the love of independence. He went to different Maniot families and offered them positions if they supported the king. Many of the Achamnomeri (see note \u03b1 below) and some Megalogenites were convinced by his offers and submitted. However, several of the older families and the poorer Achamnomeri rejected the offer, because the former did not want to be dependent on a king and the latter did not want governors with superior rights.\nIn [[Kitta]], this division caused bloodshed when the king's supporters started fighting the other Maniots under the command of Giorgaros Skylakakos.<ref name=\"Kassis44\"/> Feder soon arrived with his new allies and exploded Skylakakos and all his allies in his towers. Thus the Bavarians managed to annex the whole peninsula to the Greek kingdom.<ref name=\"Kassis45\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=45}}.</ref>\n\n===Late 19th century===\n[[File:Al\u00e8xandros Koumoundo\u00f9ros.JPG|thumb|[[Alexandros Koumoundouros]] (1817\u20131883), born in the Messenian side of Mani, was a political personality famous for his work towards national progress.]]\n\nDuring Otto's rule, blood was spilled in Mani because of the [[vendettas]], which have plagued the area for centuries.<ref name=\"Kassis45\"/> The vendettas continued until 1870, when a Maniot vendetta was halted by the efforts of a regular army with artillery support.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos36\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=36}}.</ref> In 1841, [[Crete]] revolted against the Ottomans.

A combined Ottoman-British fleet managed to subdue the Cretans, but the indefeated Maniots chose to go back to Mani. In 1866, a new revolution sparked in Crete, and 2,000 Maniots under the command of Petropoulakos went to assist their cousins. However, the Cretans were defeated, and the undefeated Maniots again returned to Mani.<ref name=\"Kassis45\"/>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Gythio.JPG|thumb|left|View of the promenade of [[Gytheio]], largest town of Mani.]]\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, Greece was involved with the [[Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Macedonian Struggle]], military conflicts against the Bulgarian organization known as the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]], and Turkish forces in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-occupied [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Many volunteers from Mani took part in the war such as soldiers from the Dritsakos, Koutsonikolakos, Kosteas, Georgopapadakos, Iliopiereas, Loukakos, Kyriakoulakos and Kalantzakos families. The Maniots also took part in the series of wars that followed including the [[Balkan Wars]], [[World War I]], and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]]. The participation of troops from Mani in these wars under [[Constantine I of Greece]], created strong [[Monarchism|royalist]] feelings amongst Maniots. That is why most Maniots remained loyal to Constantine during the Greek [[National Schism]].<ref name=\"Kassis46\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=46}}.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Maniot armed forces significantly helped the [[Hellenic Army]] to win the [[Battle of Greece]]. A Maniot named Colonel [[Konstantinos Davakis]] was among the leaders of the armed forces.<ref name=\"Kassis46\"/> Davakis, in command of the Pindus Detachment, defeated the elite Italian SOF brigate \"Julia\" at the [[Battle of Pindus]] (October 28-November 13, 1940), despite the Italians having more advanced weaponry.\n\nLater, Maniots won another victory when the [[Royal Navy]] of the [[United Kingdom]] defeated the [[Regia Marina]] of Italy in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] (March 27-March 29, 1941) on Cape [[Tenaro]]. However, [[Nazi Germany]] attacked Greece in order to support the Italians. The Greeks were forced to retreat, and soon Mani revived its forgotten role as a center for refugees. During April 1941, the British started evacuating their troops from Porto Kagio. By the end of that month, Mani and the rest of Greece were under [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Italian and German occupation]].<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos141\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=141}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the occupation, Mani became a stronghold of the [[Security Battalions]], because of the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] sentiment of the Maniots. The Germans and Italians left Greece in 1944, but as soon as they left the [[Greek Civil War]] began. The armies of the [[Communist Party of Greece]], [[Ellinikos La\u00efkos Apeleftherotikos Stratos|ELAS]], and [[Dimokratikos Stratos Elladas|DSE]], fought against the Hellenic Army and the royalists.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos38\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=38}}.</ref> Mani never recovered from both wars, and soon many of the young people of Mani left for [[Athens]], the [[United States]], and [[Australia]].<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos39\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=39}}.</ref>\n\nNowadays, Mani is divided between two regional units: [[Laconia]] and [[Messenia]]. Mani has around 18,000 inhabitants, with the most important and populous town being [[Gytheio]]. Mani's main source of income is tourism. The most famous of the tourist attractions are the [[Pyrgos Dirou|Caves of Diros]], which are two caves that have underwater rivers flowing through them.\n\n==Maniot dialect==\n[[File:Modern Greek dialects en.svg|200px|left|thumb|A map showing the distribution of the Maniot dialect.]]\n\nThe Maniot dialect of Modern Greek has several archaic properties that distinguishes it from most mainstream varieties. One of them, shared with the highly divergent [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]] as well as with the old dialects spoken around Athens until the 19th century, is the divergent treatment of historical {{IPA|/y/}} (written <\u03c5>). Although this sound merged to {{IPA|/i/}} everywhere else, these dialects have {{IPA|/u/}} instead (e.g. {{IPA|[\u02c8ksulo]}} versus standard {{IPA|[\u02c8ksilo]}} 'wood').<ref name=\"Trudgill5\">{{harvnb|Trudgill|2003|pp=54\u201359}}.</ref> These varieties are thought to be relic areas of a previously larger areal dialect group that used to share these features and was later divided by the penetration of [[Arvanitika]] settlement in much of its area in the late Middle Ages.\n\nOther features of the Maniot dialect include the palatalization of velar consonants, i.e. the realization of {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x, \u0263/}} as ({{IPA|[t\u0255, d\u0291]}} or {{IPA|[\u0255, \u0291]}} before {{IPA|/i, e, j/}}. This feature is shared with many southern dialects of Greek, especially Cretan.\n\n==Economy==\nThere is little information on the economy of Mani during the early stages of Ottoman dominance of Greece, and what is known of the economy in the 17th and 18th centuries is from foreign observers. In Exo Mani, [[olives]] in great numbers but it was not until the 18th century that olives were widely spread in Mesa Mani. Exports from Exo Mani also included [[pine]] for masts as well [[turpentine]], hides as well as a tanning agent and ''prinokoki'', a crimson-coloured dye. The north-west parts of Mesa Mani were rich in [[morus (plant)|mulberries]] and [[silk]]. Honey is also of superior quality.  Another important part of the Maniot economy was piracy. Nowadays the main industries in Mani are [[agriculture]] and tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zorbas.de/maniguide/turkok.html|title=The Economy|accessdate=2008-01-02|work=|author=John Chapman|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105042231/http://www.zorbas.de/maniguide/turkok.html|archive-date=2008-01-05|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Maniatissa.jpg|thumb|left|Woman from Mani.]]\n\n===Dances===\nTwo dances come from Mani: Palio Maniatiko (meaning \"Old Maniot\") and the Modern Maniatiko.

The Maniots were famous and fearsome pirates whose ships dominated the Maniot coastline. The Maniots became pirates because Mani was not a very fertile land and the Maniots did not have many natural resources. The Maniots considered piracy a legitimate response to the fact that their land was poor, and it became their main source of income.<ref name=\"Barrow16\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=16}}.</ref> The pirate raids were not stopped by the local priests of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], who in fact blessed the ships before they left and sometimes accompanied them on raids. Most of the Maniot pirates came from Messa Mani (Inner Mani).<ref name=\"Barrow17\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=17}}.</ref> The main victims of Maniot pirates were the Ottomans, but the Maniots also targeted ships of powerful European countries.<ref name=\"Kassis38\"/>\n\n===Superstition===\nThe Maniots are a very superstitious people.<ref name=\"Barrow18\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=18}}.</ref> Maniots mainly believe in [[Witchcraft|witches]], [[demon]]s, [[vampire]]s, and [[ghost]]s.<ref name=\"Barrow18\"/> When [[Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon]], was touring Mani in 1839, he found a fresh egg by the side of the road and offered it to a Maniot soldier who escorted him, who declined the offer claiming that if a [[hag]] had enchanted it he would have to marry her.<ref name=\"Barrow18\"/> The Maniots thought that certain areas were haunted by demons.<ref name=\"Barrow18\"/>\n\n===Vendettas===\nAnother important aspect of Maniot culture were the [[Feud|vendettas]] which frequently plagued Mani. Usually, the decision to start a vendetta was made at a family gathering. The main aim of a vendetta was usually to wipe out the other family.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm|title=Vendetta|accessdate=2007-01-25|work=Mani: Traditions: Vendetta|author=Venizeleas|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230081926/http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm|archive-date=2006-12-30|df=}}</ref> The families involved locked themselves in their towers and whenever they got the chance murdered members of the opposing family.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> The other families in the village normally locked themselves in their towers in order not to get in the way of the fighting.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/>\n\nSome vendettas went on for months, sometimes years. In vendettas, the families could have a truce or ''treva'', if one family needed to attend a religious ceremony or when it was time to harvest the crops.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> As soon as the treva ended, the killing could resume. Vendettas usually ended when one family was exterminated or when the defeated family left the town.

The [[Melingoi|Melengi]], a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribe in the [[Taygetus]] [[mountain range]], raided Laconia from the west, and the [[Tsakonians]] also resisted the Franks. In 1249, the new prince, [[William II of Villehardouin]], acted against the raiders. He used the newly captured fortress of [[Monemvasia]] to keep the Tsakonians at bay, and he built the castle at [[Mystras]] in the Taygetus mountains overlooking Sparta in order to contain the Melengi. To stop the Maniot raids, he built the castle of [[Megali Maina]], which is most probably [[Tigani]]. It is described as ''at a fearful cliff with a headland above''. A Latin bishop was appointed for Mani during the 1250s. In 1259, the bishop was captured during the [[Battle of Pelagonia]] by the renewed Byzantine Empire under the leadership of Nicaea.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=24}}.</ref>\n\n===Under the Despotate of Morea===\n[[File:Despotate of Morea 1450.svg|thumb|[[Despotate of Morea]], c. 1450.]]\n\nOn July 25, 1261, the Byzantines under [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] recaptured Constantinople. Prince William was set free, on the condition that he had to surrender the fortresses of Megali Maina, Mystras, [[Geronthrae]] and Monemvasia, as well as surrender hostages including [[Lady Margaret, Baroness of Passavas]]. With the Franks gone from Laconia, the Maniots lived in peace under the [[Despotate of Morea]], whose successive [[Despotes]] governed the province. Mani seems to have been dominated by the Nikliani family, who were refugees.

However, neither [[Demetrios Palaiologos]] nor [[Thomas Palaiologos]] chose to follow his example and defend the Peloponnese.

The Ottomans under [[Selim II]], preparing to [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|invade]] the Venetian island of [[Cyprus]], built a fortress in Mani, at Porto Kagio, and they also garrisoned Passavas. The aim of this was to disrupt the Venetians' communication lines and to keep the Maniots at bay. Alarmed, the Maniots called upon Venetian assistance, and the Venetian navy in combination with the Maniot army captured the castle.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos25\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=25}}.</ref>\n\nCyprus fell later that year, but the fleet of the [[Holy League (Mediterranean)|Holy League]] defeated the Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]].

He succeeded in ravaging Mani and imposing taxes on the Maniots (which they did not pay). This caused Nevers to move more actively for his crusade. Nevers sent envoys to the courts of Europe looking for support.

The Maniots supported the Venetians by offering them ships. In 1659, Admiral [[Francesco Morosini]], with 13,000 Maniots as his allies, occupied [[Kalamata]], a large city near Mani. In 1667, during the [[Siege of Candia]], some Maniot pirate ships sneaked into the Ottoman fleet and managed to loot and burn some ships.

Later that year, he sank two French ships, which was the beginning of the end for Katsonis. An Ottoman fleet of thirty ships and a French destroyer attacked Katsonis at Porto Kagio.

The Ottomans replaced him with Antony Grigorakis or Antonbey, cousin of Zanetos.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos31\"/> The Turkish fleet under the command of the [[admiral]] Seremet,<ref name=\"Kassis37\"/> was unable to capture Cranae and was soon forced to retreat.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos31\"/>\n\n[[File:Limeni Mani.jpg|thumb|[[Limeni]], [[Areopoli]], stronghold of Mavromichalis' clan]]\n\nIn 1805, Seremet attacked Zacharias Barbitsiotis at his fortress in the [[Taygetus]] mountains and managed to kill him.<ref name=\"Kassis37\"/> In [[Ottoman Invasion of Mani (1807)|1807]], the Ottomans attacked Antonbey at [[Gytheio]], because he was unwilling to suppress his cousin, who was still attacking the Turks. The Turks were once again forced to retreat. Three years later, Antonbey resigned in favor of his son-in-law, Konstantis Zervakos, who was favorable to the bey of the Peloponnese. However, the Maniots did not agree with the choice and deposed Zervakos.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos32\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nLater that year, the Maniot leaders gathered at Gytheio and elected Theodoros Zanerakos or Theodorobey, nephew of Zanetos Grigorakis, as Bey of Mani.

This was part of the Legion of Light Riflemen, a force made up of mainland refugees that defended the Ionian Islands and participated in Russian operations in the Mediterranean in the years 1805\u20131807. Many veterans of this unit later joined the secret society [[Filiki Eteria]] (\"Friendly Company\") and participated with the Greek Revolution, including Elias Chrisospathis, who initiated the Maniots into the secret society, as well as Pierros and his brothers Giorgos and Zanetakos.\n\nPetros Mavromichalis was John the Dog's nephew. He was the first Maniot bey from Messa Mani (Inner Mani).<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos32\"/> In 1798, he had also been approached by Napoleon to join the war on the Ottomans, but after the failure of the [[French invasion of Egypt (1798)|French invasion of Egypt]], Petros joined the French army only for a while and fought in the [[Ionian Islands]]. It was rumored at the time that he was appointed bey only because his uncle was not killed, had converted to Islam, and had become an officer in the Ottoman army.\nIn 1819, he joined the [[Filiki Eteria]], which by 1821 was prepared to revolt.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos33\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=33}}.</ref>\n\n===\"Declaration of War\" and Contributions to the Greek Revolution===\n[[File:Mani Flag (Greece).svg|thumb|Maniot flag with the motto \"Victory or Death\".]]\n\nManiots, known for their martial qualities, were the very first to join the Greek liberation movement (a claim shared with many other Greek areas) and their contribution proved to be pivotal.

On March 23, they captured the city.<ref name=\"Kassis39\"/> From Kalamata, Mavromichalis wrote letters to the states of [[Europe]], informing them of what the Greeks were doing and signing them as \"Commander in Chief of the Spartan Forces\". The Messenian Senate was also held in Kalamata. Kolokotronis wanted to attack [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]] and capture the main Turkish city in the Peloponnese. However, Mavromichalis wanted to capture the smaller towns first and then take [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. The Senate agreed with Mavromichalis, and the Maniots attacked the Turks of Messenia and Laconia.<ref name=\"Paroulakis58\">{{harvnb|Paroulakis|1984|p=58}}.</ref>{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}}\n\nKolokotronis, convinced that he was correct, moved into [[Arcadia]] with 300 Maniots.

On September 12, 1821, the Turkish capital in the Peloponnese fell. On July 4 1822, [[Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis (military commander)|Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis]], Petros Mavromichalis' younger brother, was killed in [[Ammoudia, Preveza|Splantza]], near the [[Souli]]ote fortress of Kiafa. \n\n[[Mahmud II]] became desperate and during 1824 called on his [[Viceroy]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], to aid him to attack Mani. Ali promised to aid him in return for the islands of [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]], as well as making his eldest son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]], pasha of the [[Peloponnese]]. Mahmud II accepted the offer and Ali sent his son in command of the expedition. Meanwhile, the Greeks were in disarray because of political rivalries, which caused a civil war. Kolokotronis was arrested, his son [[Panos Kolokotronis|Panos]] was killed, and his nephew [[Nikitaras]] fled.<ref name=\"Paroulakis113\">{{harvnb|Paroulakis|1984|p=113}}.</ref>{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}}\n\nIbrahim made good use of this turmoil and landed with his army (25-30,000 infantry, cavalry and artillery supported by the Ottoman-Egyptian fleet) at [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]. Ibrahim soon had recaptured the Peloponnese except for [[Nafplio]] and Mani.

He sent an envoy to the Maniots demanding that they surrender or else he would ravage their land. Instead of surrendering, the Maniots replied:<ref name=\"Kassis39\"/>\n\n''From the few Greeks of Mani and the rest of Greeks who live there to Ibrahim Pasha. We received your letter in which you try to frighten us saying that if we don't surrender, you'll kill the Maniots and plunder Mani. That's why we are waiting for you and your army. We, the inhabitants of Mani, sign and await you.''\n\nEnraged by the Spartan reply, Ibrahim, commanding an army of 7,000 men, attacked Mani on June 21, 1826.<ref name=\"Kassis40\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=40}}.</ref> He was stopped at the walls of Almiros and Verga, which ran for around 500 meters.<ref>{{harvnb|Saitas|1990|p=12}}.</ref> Defending the walls were 2,000 Maniots under the command of Ilias Mavromichalis (Katsakos) and 500 Greek refugees.<ref name=\"Kassis40\"/><ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=62}}.</ref> As Ibrahim moved his infantry and cavalry against the Maniot position, he also ordered two of his ships, including the one he was on, to attack the Maniot fortifications from the sea with their artillery.

This battle not only was costly for Ibrahim, who suffered 2,500 casualties, but also ruined his plan to invade Mani from the north.<ref name=\"Kassis39\"/><ref name=\"Kassis40\"/>\n\nWhile Ibrahim was beginning his attack on the Maniot position at Verga, he decided to launch a small fleet and attack [[Areopoli]]. This plan was described by Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos as \"excellent\" because it would catch Areopoli by surprise since it was ill defended. By capturing Areopoli, Ibrahim could disrupt the Maniot communication lines and control the mountain passes that led to [[Gytheio]]. This would also allow the Egyptians to attack the Maniots at Verga from the rear.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62\"/>\n\nOn June 24, Ibrahim sent a small fleet carrying 1,500 troops to land at the Bay of Diros and capture Areopoli.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62\"/> As the Egyptians landed on the beach, the alarm bells rang.<ref name=\"Kassis40\"/> Soon, 300 women and old men who had been harvesting the crops gathered and, armed only with their scythes and cudgels, charged at the Egyptians. The Egyptians, not expecting any resistance, were caught by surprise at this sudden attack and were forced to retreat to a fortified position on the beach where they could receive support from their ships. Eventually, 300 Maniots arrived from other towns, and the Egyptians were forced to either swim to their ships or be slain.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62\"/> Not only was Ibrahim's defeat costly, as he lost 1,000 men, but his plan to invade and conquer Mani was utterly ruined. Later on, the women of Diros were dubbed the 'Amazons of Diros'.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos63\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=63}}.</ref>\n\nIbrahim, annoyed by his defeats at Verga and Diros, plundered the Peloponnese for a month before turning his attention back to Mani. He sent an army of 6,000 Arabs to advance to the Taygetus and capture Gytheio and Laconian Mani. In command of the army was a Greek traitor from the village of [[Vordonia]], called Bosinas. As he advanced towards Polytsaravos (nowadays a deserted place in the southern part of [[Taygetus]]), he was stopped by Theodoros Stathakos, who together with his family of thirteen people was waiting in their tower. Bosinas tried to make Stathakos surrender, and when the latter feigned surrender, Bosinas came towards the tower. However, once Bosinas was within range, Stathakos and his small band killed him. In retaliation, Bosinas' army shot at the tower with their cannons and destroyed it.<ref name=\"Kassis41\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=41}}.</ref>\n\nThe Egyptians then proceeded towards the town of Polytsaravos and reached it on August 28. The inhabitants of the town had sent the women and children to take refuge in the mountains before improving the fortifications they had there. The town militia was reinforced by other Maniots, and soon the defenders numbered 2,500 men.<ref name=\"Kassis41\"/> The Egyptians had trouble advancing to Polytsaravos, because it was surrounded by rocks situated on high ground.<ref name=\"Barrow102\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=102}}.</ref> As soon as the Arabs arrived, the Maniots rallied around their fortifications and attacked the Arabs. The Arabs retreated from Polytsaravos after sustaining 400 casualties while the Maniots only suffered nine.<ref name=\"Kassis41\"/> Even though this campaign is overshadowed by other battles of the revolution, it was one of the most important, according to Maniot regional historians. The Maniots stopped the Egyptians and Ibrahim Pasha who had not been defeated this decisively before. This was the last invasion of Mani by the Egyptians or the Ottomans, as the Peloponnese, central Greece, and some of the Aegean islands were liberated in 1828 after the naval forces of [[Bourbon Restoration]] France under [[Henri de Rigny]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] under [[Edward Codrington]], and the [[Russian Empire]] under [[Login Geiden]] defeated Ibrahim at the [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]] in 1827.\n\n===Republic and Regency===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Petrobey Mavromichalis1.jpg\n| width1 = 130\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Kapodistrias2.jpg\n| width2 = 105\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The imprisonment of [[Petros Mavromichalis]] (left) by [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] (right) led to the assassination of Kapodistrias.\n}}\n\nIn 1831, [[Ioannis Capodistrias]] became governor of Greece.<ref name=\"Kassis41\"/> Capodistrias quarreled with the Mavromichalis clan because the Maniots refused to pay taxes to the new government.<ref name=\"Paroulakis165\">{{harvnb|Paroulakis|1984|p=165}}.</ref>{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}} Capodistrias requested that [[Tzanis Mavromichalis|Tzanis]], Petros' brother, go to [[Nafplio]], then capital of Greece, and negotiate. As soon as Tzanis arrived, he was arrested and imprisoned. Capodistrias then sent soldiers to Mani and had Petros arrested, imprisoned, and charged with [[high treason]]. His brother Konstantinos, the defender of Nafplio, and Petros' son, [[Georgios Mavromichalis]], were put under house arrest in the capital.<ref name=\"Paroulakis168\">{{harvnb|Paroulakis|1984|p=168}}.</ref>{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}}\n\nOn September 27, 1831 (October 9 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]), Capodistrias went to attend a church service at the Church of Saint Spyridon. He noticed that Konstantinos and Georgios were waiting at the church doors. As he passed them, he briefly stopped before proceeding into the church. As he was about to step into the church, Konstantinos used his gun and the bullet hit Capodistrias at the back of the head while at the same time Georgios stabbed him through the heart. Capodistrias collapsed into the arms of his attendants. Capodistrias' bodyguard shot Konstantinos as he was running, and Konstantinos was hit by several more bullets before he died. Kostantinos' body was then dragged by an angry mob, who threw it into the sea. Georgios was captured and executed on the island of Bourzi, off the coast of Nafplio, while his father watched.<ref name=\"Paroulakis168\"/>\n\nIn 1833, [[Otto of Greece|Otto von Wittelsbach]], a son of [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, became [[King of Greece]] after he was appointed by the [[Great Powers]]. Since he was underage, he had a Council of Regency headed by [[Josef Ludwig von Armansperg]] governing the country for him.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos58\"/> One of the Council's first acts was to try to subdue the unruly Maniots and pull down their towers; another was to free Petros and Tzanis from their prisons.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos35\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=35}}.</ref> The council sent an army of [[Bavarians]] in order to tame Messa Mani.<ref name=\"Kassis43\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=43}}.</ref> They made it to [[Areopoli]], but during the night the Maniots surrounded and captured them, forcing them to leave the area.<ref name=\"Kassis44\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=44}}.</ref>\n\nOn May 14, 1834, four companies of Bavarian troops, assisted by four cannons, besieged the town of [[Petrovouni, Messenia|Petrovouni]]. Ultimately, 800 Maniots from the surrounding towns attacked the Bavarians. The Bavarians were massacred as most of them were either slain by the Maniots or fell into a ravine near the town while escaping. Later that year, an army of 6,000 men with five cannons under the command of General [[Christian von Schmaltz]], assisted by five squadrons of royalist Maniots, once again besieged Petrovouni. When news of an army of 1,000 Maniots was approaching, they retreated to Gytheio.<ref name=\"Kassis44\"/>\n\nThe Council decided that they could not subdue the Maniots by force, so they decided to send a diplomat, Max Feder, with the intention of subduing Mani by playing the love of money against the love of independence. He went to different Maniot families and offered them positions if they supported the king. Many of the Achamnomeri (see note \u03b1 below) and some Megalogenites were convinced by his offers and submitted. However, several of the older families and the poorer Achamnomeri rejected the offer, because the former did not want to be dependent on a king and the latter did not want governors with superior rights.\nIn [[Kitta]], this division caused bloodshed when the king's supporters started fighting the other Maniots under the command of Giorgaros Skylakakos.<ref name=\"Kassis44\"/> Feder soon arrived with his new allies and exploded Skylakakos and all his allies in his towers.

A combined Ottoman-British fleet managed to subdue the Cretans, but the indefeated Maniots chose to go back to Mani. In 1866, a new revolution sparked in Crete, and 2,000 Maniots under the command of Petropoulakos went to assist their cousins. However, the Cretans were defeated, and the undefeated Maniots again returned to Mani.<ref name=\"Kassis45\"/>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Gythio.JPG|thumb|left|View of the promenade of [[Gytheio]], largest town of Mani.]]\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, Greece was involved with the [[Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Macedonian Struggle]], military conflicts against the Bulgarian organization known as the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]], and Turkish forces in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-occupied [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Many volunteers from Mani took part in the war such as soldiers from the Dritsakos, Koutsonikolakos, Kosteas, Georgopapadakos, Iliopiereas, Loukakos, Kyriakoulakos and Kalantzakos families. The Maniots also took part in the series of wars that followed including the [[Balkan Wars]], [[World War I]], and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]]. The participation of troops from Mani in these wars under [[Constantine I of Greece]], created strong [[Monarchism|royalist]] feelings amongst Maniots. That is why most Maniots remained loyal to Constantine during the Greek [[National Schism]].<ref name=\"Kassis46\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=46}}.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Maniot armed forces significantly helped the [[Hellenic Army]] to win the [[Battle of Greece]].

However, [[Nazi Germany]] attacked Greece in order to support the Italians. The Greeks were forced to retreat, and soon Mani revived its forgotten role as a center for refugees. During April 1941, the British started evacuating their troops from Porto Kagio. By the end of that month, Mani and the rest of Greece were under [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Italian and German occupation]].<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos141\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=141}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the occupation, Mani became a stronghold of the [[Security Battalions]], because of the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] sentiment of the Maniots. The Germans and Italians left Greece in 1944, but as soon as they left the [[Greek Civil War]] began. The armies of the [[Communist Party of Greece]], [[Ellinikos La\u00efkos Apeleftherotikos Stratos|ELAS]], and [[Dimokratikos Stratos Elladas|DSE]], fought against the Hellenic Army and the royalists.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos38\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=38}}.</ref> Mani never recovered from both wars, and soon many of the young people of Mani left for [[Athens]], the [[United States]], and [[Australia]].<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos39\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=39}}.</ref>\n\nNowadays, Mani is divided between two regional units: [[Laconia]] and [[Messenia]]. Mani has around 18,000 inhabitants, with the most important and populous town being [[Gytheio]]. Mani's main source of income is tourism. The most famous of the tourist attractions are the [[Pyrgos Dirou|Caves of Diros]], which are two caves that have underwater rivers flowing through them.\n\n==Maniot dialect==\n[[File:Modern Greek dialects en.svg|200px|left|thumb|A map showing the distribution of the Maniot dialect.]]\n\nThe Maniot dialect of Modern Greek has several archaic properties that distinguishes it from most mainstream varieties. One of them, shared with the highly divergent [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]] as well as with the old dialects spoken around Athens until the 19th century, is the divergent treatment of historical {{IPA|/y/}} (written <\u03c5>). Although this sound merged to {{IPA|/i/}} everywhere else, these dialects have {{IPA|/u/}} instead (e.g. {{IPA|[\u02c8ksulo]}} versus standard {{IPA|[\u02c8ksilo]}} 'wood').<ref name=\"Trudgill5\">{{harvnb|Trudgill|2003|pp=54\u201359}}.</ref> These varieties are thought to be relic areas of a previously larger areal dialect group that used to share these features and was later divided by the penetration of [[Arvanitika]] settlement in much of its area in the late Middle Ages.\n\nOther features of the Maniot dialect include the palatalization of velar consonants, i.e. the realization of {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x, \u0263/}} as ({{IPA|[t\u0255, d\u0291]}} or {{IPA|[\u0255, \u0291]}} before {{IPA|/i, e, j/}}. This feature is shared with many southern dialects of Greek, especially Cretan.\n\n==Economy==\nThere is little information on the economy of Mani during the early stages of Ottoman dominance of Greece, and what is known of the economy in the 17th and 18th centuries is from foreign observers. In Exo Mani, [[olives]] in great numbers but it was not until the 18th century that olives were widely spread in Mesa Mani. Exports from Exo Mani also included [[pine]] for masts as well [[turpentine]], hides as well as a tanning agent and ''prinokoki'', a crimson-coloured dye. The north-west parts of Mesa Mani were rich in [[morus (plant)|mulberries]] and [[silk]]. Honey is also of superior quality.  Another important part of the Maniot economy was piracy. Nowadays the main industries in Mani are [[agriculture]] and tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zorbas.de/maniguide/turkok.html|title=The Economy|accessdate=2008-01-02|work=|author=John Chapman|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105042231/http://www.zorbas.de/maniguide/turkok.html|archive-date=2008-01-05|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Maniatissa.jpg|thumb|left|Woman from Mani.]]\n\n===Dances===\nTwo dances come from Mani: Palio Maniatiko (meaning \"Old Maniot\") and the Modern Maniatiko.

When any strangers come ashore, who do not understand their language, the feigned priests make signes to them, shewing them their bread and wine, which they offer to them for money, by which the strangers being enticed from the sea side (and it may be to sit down and taste their wine) the hidden Manjotts come and make their prey. The priests will seem to be sorry, and endeavor to make the strangers to believe they were altogether ignorant of any such design. So a white flagg is put out, and a treaty held with the ship for their ransome. The priests endeavor to moderate the price, shewing a great deal of respect to their companions, who are clothed in Turkish habits.

The Maniots were famous and fearsome pirates whose ships dominated the Maniot coastline. The Maniots became pirates because Mani was not a very fertile land and the Maniots did not have many natural resources. The Maniots considered piracy a legitimate response to the fact that their land was poor, and it became their main source of income.<ref name=\"Barrow16\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=16}}.</ref> The pirate raids were not stopped by the local priests of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], who in fact blessed the ships before they left and sometimes accompanied them on raids. Most of the Maniot pirates came from Messa Mani (Inner Mani).<ref name=\"Barrow17\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=17}}.</ref> The main victims of Maniot pirates were the Ottomans, but the Maniots also targeted ships of powerful European countries.<ref name=\"Kassis38\"/>\n\n===Superstition===\nThe Maniots are a very superstitious people.<ref name=\"Barrow18\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=18}}.</ref> Maniots mainly believe in [[Witchcraft|witches]], [[demon]]s, [[vampire]]s, and [[ghost]]s.<ref name=\"Barrow18\"/> When [[Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon]], was touring Mani in 1839, he found a fresh egg by the side of the road and offered it to a Maniot soldier who escorted him, who declined the offer claiming that if a [[hag]] had enchanted it he would have to marry her.<ref name=\"Barrow18\"/> The Maniots thought that certain areas were haunted by demons.<ref name=\"Barrow18\"/>\n\n===Vendettas===\nAnother important aspect of Maniot culture were the [[Feud|vendettas]] which frequently plagued Mani. Usually, the decision to start a vendetta was made at a family gathering. The main aim of a vendetta was usually to wipe out the other family.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm|title=Vendetta|accessdate=2007-01-25|work=Mani: Traditions: Vendetta|author=Venizeleas|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230081926/http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm|archive-date=2006-12-30|df=}}</ref> The families involved locked themselves in their towers and whenever they got the chance murdered members of the opposing family.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> The other families in the village normally locked themselves in their towers in order not to get in the way of the fighting.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/>\n\nSome vendettas went on for months, sometimes years. In vendettas, the families could have a truce or ''treva'', if one family needed to attend a religious ceremony or when it was time to harvest the crops.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> As soon as the treva ended, the killing could resume. Vendettas usually ended when one family was exterminated or when the defeated family left the town. Sometimes families came to terms, and vendettas stopped when the Turks invaded.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> The longest treva occurred when the Mavromichalis clan declared war on the Turks in 1821. Vendettas continued after the liberation of Greece even though the Regency tried to demolish the towers.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> The Maniot vendetta is considered the most vicious and ruthless. One of the last vendettas on record required the combined forces of the [[Greek Police]], [[Greek Army]] and [[Greek Navy]] to stop it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cretapost.gr/282097/1906-i-ematiri-venteta-anamesa-se-maniates-ke-kritikous/|title=1906: \u0397 \u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03ae \u03b2\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b5 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u2013 Cretapost.gr|author=|date=12 November 2016|website=cretapost.gr|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515195912/http://www.cretapost.gr/282097/1906-i-ematiri-venteta-anamesa-se-maniates-ke-kritikous|archive-date=15 May 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\nLocal specialities:\n\n* ''[[Hilopites]]''\n* ''Kolokythokorfades''\n* ''Lalagides'' or ''Lalagia'' (\u039b\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2)\n* ''Paspalas''\n* ''Regali''\n* ''[[Syglino]]'' (pork meat)\n* ''[[Diples]]'' (dessert)\n\n==Ethnology==\nThe inhabitants of Mani claim to be direct descendants of the ancient [[Sparta]]ns and are considered more \"pure-blooded\" Greeks.

When the Avars and Slavs invaded the Peloponnese, many Greek refugees fled to Mani since the invaders could not infiltrate the mountainous terrain. According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, the Maniots were not conquered by the Slavs and were descended from the ancient 'Romaioi'.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22\"/> Historian David Howarth states: ''The only Greeks that have had an unbroken descent were the few small clans like the Maniotes who were so fierce, and lived so far up the mountain, that invaders left them alone.''<ref name=\"Howarth69\">{{harvnb|Howarth|1976|p=69}}.</ref>\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n\n==Notable Maniots==\n* [[Panagiotis Doxaras]], painter, founder of the [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School]]\n* [[Limberakis Gerakaris]], First [[Bey]] of [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] and one of the most feared Maniot Pirates\n* [[Stylianos Mavromichalis]], lawyer, president of the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Areopagus]] and Prime Minister (1963)\n* [[Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis (military commander)|Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis]], hero of the [[Greek War of Independence]]\n* [[Petros Mavromichalis]], starter and fighter of the [[Greek War of Independence]], last [[Bey]] of [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]], [[Lieutenant General]] and President of the Executive (1823).\n* [[Michail Anagnostakos]], military officer and army leader of the [[Macedonian Struggle]].\n* [[Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis|Kyriakoulis P.

It is stated in terms of three positive integers, ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' (hence the name) that are [[coprime integers|relatively prime]] and satisfy ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c''. If ''d'' denotes the product of the distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''abc'', the conjecture essentially states that ''d'' is usually not much smaller than ''c''. In other words: if ''a'' and ''b'' are composed from large powers of primes, then ''c'' is usually not divisible by large powers of primes. The precise statement is given below.\nThe ''abc'' conjecture originated as the outcome of attempts by Oesterl\u00e9 and Masser to understand the [[Szpiro conjecture]] about elliptic curves.<ref>{{citation|title=Arithmetic deformation theory via arithmetic fundamental groups and nonarchimedean theta functions, notes on the work of Shinichi Mochizuki|journal= European Journal of Mathematics|first=Ivan|last=Fesenko|volume=1 |issue=3| pages=405\u2013440 | year=2015 |url=https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/personal/ibf/notesoniut.pdf |doi=10.1007/s40879-015-0066-0}}.</ref> The latter conjecture has more geometric structures involved in its statement in comparison with the ''abc'' conjecture.\n\nThe ''abc'' conjecture and its versions express, in concentrated form, some fundamental feature of various problems in Diophantine geometry.

So in this case, it does not matter which concept we use.</ref> positive integers such that ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', it turns out that \"usually\" ''c'' < rad(''abc''). The ''abc conjecture'' deals with the exceptions. Specifically, it states that:\n\n:'''ABC conjecture.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', such that\n::<math>c > \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nAn equivalent formulation:\n\n:'''ABC conjecture II.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exists a constant ''K<sub>\u03b5</sub>'' such that for all triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'':\n::<math>c < K_{\\varepsilon} \\cdot \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nA third equivalent formulation of the conjecture involves the ''quality'' ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of the triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c''), defined as\n\n: <math> q(a, b, c) = \\frac{ \\log(c) }{ \\log\\big(\\operatorname{rad}(abc)\\big) }.</math>\n\nFor example:\n\n:''q''(4, 127, 131) = log(131) / log(rad(4\u00b7127\u00b7131)) = log(131) / log(2\u00b7127\u00b7131) = 0.46820...\n:''q''(3, 125, 128) = log(128) / log(rad(3\u00b7125\u00b7128)) = log(128) / log(30) = 1.426565...\n\nA typical triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' will have ''c'' < rad(''abc''), i.e. ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') < 1. Triples with ''q'' > 1 such as in the second example are rather special, they consist of numbers divisible by high powers of small [[prime number]]s.\n\n:'''ABC conjecture III.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') > 1 + ''\u03b5''.\n\nWhereas it is known that there are infinitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') > 1, the conjecture predicts that only finitely many of those have ''q'' > 1.01 or ''q'' > 1.001 or even ''q'' > 1.0001, etc. In particular, if the conjecture is true, then there must exist a triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') that achieves the maximal possible quality ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') .\n\n==Examples of triples with small radical==\nThe condition that ''\u03b5'' > 0 is necessary as there exist infinitely many triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') < ''c''. For example, let\n\n:<math>a = 1, \\quad b = 2^{6n} - 1, \\quad c = 2^{6n}, \\qquad n > 1.</math>\n\nThe integer ''b'' is divisible by 9:\n\n:<math> b = 2^{6n} - 1  =  64^n - 1 = (64 - 1) (\\cdots) = 9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot (\\cdots).</math>\n\nUsing this fact we calculate:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{rad}(abc) &= \\operatorname{rad}(a) \\operatorname{rad}(b) \\operatorname{rad}(c) \\\\\n&= \\operatorname{rad}(1)  \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 2^{6n} -1 \\right ) \\operatorname{rad} \\left (2^{6n} \\right ) \\\\\n&= 2 \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 2^{6n} -1 \\right ) \\\\\n&= 2 \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 9 \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{9} \\right )  \\\\\n&\\leqslant 2 \\cdot 3  \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{9} \\\\\n&= 2 \\tfrac{b}{3} \\\\\n&< \\tfrac{2}{3} c.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy replacing the exponent 6''n'' by other exponents forcing ''b'' to have larger square factors, the ratio between the radical and ''c'' can be made arbitrarily small. Specifically, let ''p'' > 2 be a prime and consider\n\n:<math>a = 1, \\quad b = 2^{p(p-1)n} - 1, \\quad c = 2^{p(p-1)n}, \\qquad n > 1.</math>\n\nNow we claim that ''b'' is divisible by ''p''<sup>2</sup>:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nb &= 2^{p(p-1)n} - 1 \\\\\n&= \\left(2^{p(p-1)}\\right)^n - 1 \\\\\n&= \\left(2^{p(p-1)} - 1\\right) (\\cdots) \\\\\n&= p^2 \\cdot r (\\cdots).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe last step uses the fact that ''p''<sup>2</sup> divides 2<sup>''p''(''p''\u22121)</sup>\u00a0\u2212\u00a01. This follows from [[Fermat's little theorem]], which shows that, for ''p''\u00a0>\u00a02, 2<sup>''p''\u22121</sup>\u00a0=\u00a0''pk''\u00a0+\u00a01 for some integer ''k''. Raising both sides to the power of ''p'' then shows that 2<sup>''p''(''p''\u22121)</sup>\u00a0=\u00a0''p''<sup>2</sup>(...)\u00a0+\u00a01.\n\nAnd now with a similar calculation as above we have\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{rad}(abc) < \\tfrac{2}{p} c.</math>\n\nA list of the [[#Highest-quality triples|highest-quality triples]] (triples with a particularly small radical relative to ''c'') is given below; the highest quality, 1.6299, was found by Eric Reyssat {{harv|Lando|Zvonkin|2004|p=137}} for\n:''a'' = 2,\n:''b'' = 3<sup>10</sup>\u00b7109 = {{val|6,436,341}},\n:''c'' = 23<sup>5</sup> = {{val|6,436,343}},\n:rad(''abc'') = {{val|15042}}.\n\n==Some consequences==\n\nThe ''abc'' conjecture has a large number of consequences. These include both known results (some of which have been proven separately since the conjecture has been stated) and conjectures for which it gives a [[conditional proof]]. While an earlier proof of the conjecture would have been more significant in terms of consequences, the ''abc'' conjecture itself remains of interest for the other conjectures it would prove, together with its numerous links with deep questions in number theory.

Bounds are known that are [[exponential function|exponential]].

The bounds apply to any triple for which ''c'' > 2.\n\n==Computational results==\nIn 2006, the Mathematics Department of [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, together with the Dutch Kennislink science institute, launched the [[ABC@Home]] project, a [[grid computing]] system, which aims to discover additional triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') < ''c''. Although no finite set of examples or counterexamples can resolve the ''abc'' conjecture, it is hoped that patterns in the triples discovered by this project will lead to insights about the conjecture and about number theory more generally.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Distribution of triples with ''q'' > 1<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{Citation|url=http://www.rekenmeemetabc.nl/?item=h_stats |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222221716/http://rekenmeemetabc.nl/?item=h_stats |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 22, 2008 |title=Synthese resultaten |work=RekenMeeMetABC.nl |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |language=nl }}.</ref>\n|-\n!

It is stated in terms of three positive integers, ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' (hence the name) that are [[coprime integers|relatively prime]] and satisfy ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c''. If ''d'' denotes the product of the distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''abc'', the conjecture essentially states that ''d'' is usually not much smaller than ''c''. In other words: if ''a'' and ''b'' are composed from large powers of primes, then ''c'' is usually not divisible by large powers of primes. The precise statement is given below.\nThe ''abc'' conjecture originated as the outcome of attempts by Oesterl\u00e9 and Masser to understand the [[Szpiro conjecture]] about elliptic curves.<ref>{{citation|title=Arithmetic deformation theory via arithmetic fundamental groups and nonarchimedean theta functions, notes on the work of Shinichi Mochizuki|journal= European Journal of Mathematics|first=Ivan|last=Fesenko|volume=1 |issue=3| pages=405\u2013440 | year=2015 |url=https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/personal/ibf/notesoniut.pdf |doi=10.1007/s40879-015-0066-0}}.</ref> The latter conjecture has more geometric structures involved in its statement in comparison with the ''abc'' conjecture.\n\nThe ''abc'' conjecture and its versions express, in concentrated form, some fundamental feature of various problems in Diophantine geometry. A number of famous conjectures and theorems in number theory would follow immediately from the ''abc'' conjecture or its versions. {{harvtxt|Goldfeld|1996}} described the ''abc'' conjecture as \"the most important unsolved problem in [[Diophantine analysis]]\".\n\nVarious attempts to prove the abc conjecture have been made, but none are currently accepted by the mainstream mathematical community and the conjecture is still largely recognized to be unproven as of 2020.<ref name=\"nature-2020\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/d41586-020-00998-2 |title=Mathematical proof that rocked number theory will be published |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|first=Davide|last=Castelvecchi |date=3 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Formulations==\nBefore we state the conjecture we introduce the notion of the  [[radical of an integer]]: for a [[positive integer]] ''n'', the radical of ''n'', denoted rad(''n''), is the product of the distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''n''.

So in this case, it does not matter which concept we use.</ref> positive integers such that ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', it turns out that \"usually\" ''c'' < rad(''abc''). The ''abc conjecture'' deals with the exceptions. Specifically, it states that:\n\n:'''ABC conjecture.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'', such that\n::<math>c > \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nAn equivalent formulation:\n\n:'''ABC conjecture II.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exists a constant ''K<sub>\u03b5</sub>'' such that for all triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers, with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'':\n::<math>c < K_{\\varepsilon} \\cdot \\operatorname{rad}(abc)^{1+\\varepsilon}.</math>\n\nA third equivalent formulation of the conjecture involves the ''quality'' ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of the triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c''), defined as\n\n: <math> q(a, b, c) = \\frac{ \\log(c) }{ \\log\\big(\\operatorname{rad}(abc)\\big) }.</math>\n\nFor example:\n\n:''q''(4, 127, 131) = log(131) / log(rad(4\u00b7127\u00b7131)) = log(131) / log(2\u00b7127\u00b7131) = 0.46820...\n:''q''(3, 125, 128) = log(128) / log(rad(3\u00b7125\u00b7128)) = log(128) / log(30) = 1.426565...\n\nA typical triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' will have ''c'' < rad(''abc''), i.e. ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') < 1. Triples with ''q'' > 1 such as in the second example are rather special, they consist of numbers divisible by high powers of small [[prime number]]s.\n\n:'''ABC conjecture III.''' For every positive real number ''\u03b5'', there exist only finitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') > 1 + ''\u03b5''.\n\nWhereas it is known that there are infinitely many triples (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') of coprime positive integers with ''a'' + ''b'' = ''c'' such that ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') > 1, the conjecture predicts that only finitely many of those have ''q'' > 1.01 or ''q'' > 1.001 or even ''q'' > 1.0001, etc. In particular, if the conjecture is true, then there must exist a triple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') that achieves the maximal possible quality ''q''(''a'', ''b'', ''c'') .\n\n==Examples of triples with small radical==\nThe condition that ''\u03b5'' > 0 is necessary as there exist infinitely many triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') < ''c''. For example, let\n\n:<math>a = 1, \\quad b = 2^{6n} - 1, \\quad c = 2^{6n}, \\qquad n > 1.</math>\n\nThe integer ''b'' is divisible by 9:\n\n:<math> b = 2^{6n} - 1  =  64^n - 1 = (64 - 1) (\\cdots) = 9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot (\\cdots).</math>\n\nUsing this fact we calculate:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{rad}(abc) &= \\operatorname{rad}(a) \\operatorname{rad}(b) \\operatorname{rad}(c) \\\\\n&= \\operatorname{rad}(1)  \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 2^{6n} -1 \\right ) \\operatorname{rad} \\left (2^{6n} \\right ) \\\\\n&= 2 \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 2^{6n} -1 \\right ) \\\\\n&= 2 \\operatorname{rad} \\left ( 9 \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{9} \\right )  \\\\\n&\\leqslant 2 \\cdot 3  \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{9} \\\\\n&= 2 \\tfrac{b}{3} \\\\\n&< \\tfrac{2}{3} c.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy replacing the exponent 6''n'' by other exponents forcing ''b'' to have larger square factors, the ratio between the radical and ''c'' can be made arbitrarily small. Specifically, let ''p'' > 2 be a prime and consider\n\n:<math>a = 1, \\quad b = 2^{p(p-1)n} - 1, \\quad c = 2^{p(p-1)n}, \\qquad n > 1.</math>\n\nNow we claim that ''b'' is divisible by ''p''<sup>2</sup>:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nb &= 2^{p(p-1)n} - 1 \\\\\n&= \\left(2^{p(p-1)}\\right)^n - 1 \\\\\n&= \\left(2^{p(p-1)} - 1\\right) (\\cdots) \\\\\n&= p^2 \\cdot r (\\cdots).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe last step uses the fact that ''p''<sup>2</sup> divides 2<sup>''p''(''p''\u22121)</sup>\u00a0\u2212\u00a01. This follows from [[Fermat's little theorem]], which shows that, for ''p''\u00a0>\u00a02, 2<sup>''p''\u22121</sup>\u00a0=\u00a0''pk''\u00a0+\u00a01 for some integer ''k''. Raising both sides to the power of ''p'' then shows that 2<sup>''p''(''p''\u22121)</sup>\u00a0=\u00a0''p''<sup>2</sup>(...)\u00a0+\u00a01.\n\nAnd now with a similar calculation as above we have\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{rad}(abc) < \\tfrac{2}{p} c.</math>\n\nA list of the [[#Highest-quality triples|highest-quality triples]] (triples with a particularly small radical relative to ''c'') is given below; the highest quality, 1.6299, was found by Eric Reyssat {{harv|Lando|Zvonkin|2004|p=137}} for\n:''a'' = 2,\n:''b'' = 3<sup>10</sup>\u00b7109 = {{val|6,436,341}},\n:''c'' = 23<sup>5</sup> = {{val|6,436,343}},\n:rad(''abc'') = {{val|15042}}.\n\n==Some consequences==\n\nThe ''abc'' conjecture has a large number of consequences. These include both known results (some of which have been proven separately since the conjecture has been stated) and conjectures for which it gives a [[conditional proof]]. While an earlier proof of the conjecture would have been more significant in terms of consequences, the ''abc'' conjecture itself remains of interest for the other conjectures it would prove, together with its numerous links with deep questions in number theory.

Bounds are known that are [[exponential function|exponential]].

The bounds apply to any triple for which ''c'' > 2.\n\n==Computational results==\nIn 2006, the Mathematics Department of [[Leiden University]] in the Netherlands, together with the Dutch Kennislink science institute, launched the [[ABC@Home]] project, a [[grid computing]] system, which aims to discover additional triples ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' with rad(''abc'') < ''c''. Although no finite set of examples or counterexamples can resolve the ''abc'' conjecture, it is hoped that patterns in the triples discovered by this project will lead to insights about the conjecture and about number theory more generally.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Distribution of triples with ''q'' > 1<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{Citation|url=http://www.rekenmeemetabc.nl/?item=h_stats |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222221716/http://rekenmeemetabc.nl/?item=h_stats |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 22, 2008 |title=Synthese resultaten |work=RekenMeeMetABC.nl |accessdate=October 3, 2012 |language=nl }}.</ref>\n|-\n!

These receptors recognized [[MHC class I|MHC I]] molecules on other cells and interact with them. If the inhibition is strong, it means there is signaling '''Ly49/KIR - MHC I''', the inhibition of NK cell occurs.

The F1 generation will be H2<sup>'''b/k'''</sup>. It means that there are NK cells in F1 generation, that recognize H2<sup>'''b/k'''</sup> aleles as a self MHC I and there has to be signaling through both of them to inhibition of NKs. But from the P can be only H2<sup>'''b'''/b</sup> or H2<sup>k/'''k'''</sup> transplanted, so the NKs won't be inhibited enough, because they need signals from both MHC I aleles.
