The project was approved in 1968. Three 20-storey tower blocks on the complex contained 354 flats alone.<ref>[https://www.emporis.com/complex/101170/newtown-birmingham-united-kingdom Emporis: Newtown, Birmingham]</ref>\n\n[[File:Villa Park - geograph.org.uk - 663895.jpg|thumb|left|[[Villa Park]], home of [[Aston Villa F.C.]]]]\nToday, Aston gives its name to [[Aston Villa F.C.]] and [[Aston University]] (the campus of which is not in Aston but about 1.3 to the south in Birmingham city centre). Aston University is one of four universities in Birmingham. Aston Villa have played at [[Villa Park]] since 1897, and it has traditionally been one of the largest football grounds in England that has staged many notable matches at club and international level. The park has also hosted other sports and events including international level [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]]. This is one of the main attractions in this town.\n\nMuch of Aston consists of terraced houses that were built around the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Some of these houses were demolished in the late 1960s to make way for the [[Aston Expressway]], which links Birmingham city centre to the [[M6 motorway]]. In the late 1950s, Aston was the location of the famous 'Venus Baby' case of Cynthia Appleton (87 Fentham Road).\n\nBy the early 1980s, Aston was suffering from severe deprivation with many of the terraced houses being outdated for the requirements of the time. Many of them lacked bathrooms and indoor toilets, whilst the vast majority were suffering from decay as a result of a lack of maintenance. There was speculation that the homes would be demolished, but Birmingham City Council made money available to the homeowners for them to be brought up to modern standards.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2011, Aston underwent a \u00a354 million Birmingham regeneration project named \"Aston Pride\", as part of the [[New Deal for Communities]] scheme in 2001. Many improvements were made, including reducing burglary, robbery and vehicle crime; spending \u00a34 million on a health centre; and helping more than 1300 people find work (more than the target of 400).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/news/local-news/aston-pride-named-best-inner-3923110|title=Aston Pride named best inner city regeneration scheme in UK|last=BusinessLive|date=2011-03-25|website=birminghampost|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Crime==\nCrime levels in Aston have remained stagnant in recent years.

On 2 January 2003, gunmen shot at three innocent teenage girls who were celebrating the New Year in the [[Birchfield, Birmingham|Birchfield]] area near Aston.

Aston University is one of four universities in Birmingham. Aston Villa have played at [[Villa Park]] since 1897, and it has traditionally been one of the largest football grounds in England that has staged many notable matches at club and international level. The park has also hosted other sports and events including international level [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]]. This is one of the main attractions in this town.\n\nMuch of Aston consists of terraced houses that were built around the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Some of these houses were demolished in the late 1960s to make way for the [[Aston Expressway]], which links Birmingham city centre to the [[M6 motorway]]. In the late 1950s, Aston was the location of the famous 'Venus Baby' case of Cynthia Appleton (87 Fentham Road).\n\nBy the early 1980s, Aston was suffering from severe deprivation with many of the terraced houses being outdated for the requirements of the time. Many of them lacked bathrooms and indoor toilets, whilst the vast majority were suffering from decay as a result of a lack of maintenance. There was speculation that the homes would be demolished, but Birmingham City Council made money available to the homeowners for them to be brought up to modern standards.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2011, Aston underwent a \u00a354 million Birmingham regeneration project named \"Aston Pride\", as part of the [[New Deal for Communities]] scheme in 2001. Many improvements were made, including reducing burglary, robbery and vehicle crime; spending \u00a34 million on a health centre; and helping more than 1300 people find work (more than the target of 400).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/news/local-news/aston-pride-named-best-inner-3923110|title=Aston Pride named best inner city regeneration scheme in UK|last=BusinessLive|date=2011-03-25|website=birminghampost|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Crime==\nCrime levels in Aston have remained stagnant in recent years.

On 2 January 2003, gunmen shot at three innocent teenage girls who were celebrating the New Year in the [[Birchfield, Birmingham|Birchfield]] area near Aston. Two of the girls were killed and another was seriously injured.

At 11:15 members of the Bund buttoned up their overcoats, conveniently hiding their uniforms, and were escorted through police lines along Fifty-Second amid the crowds of protesters waiting outside. Ralliers were greeted with a roar of catcalls, jeers, and even a few punches, but by midnight, all was quiet, or as quiet as it could be in downtown New York.<ref>   \u201c22,000 Nazis Hold Rally in Garden; Police Check Foes\u201d New York Times, Tuesday, February 21, 1939.</ref>\n\nIsadore Greenbaum never intended to run onto the stage. A former deck engineer and chief petty officer, Greenbaum snuck into the rally, but his anger quickly took hold of him as he listened to Kuhn speak. Speaking years later in 1989, Greenbaum characterized his actions as \u201cI went down to the Garden without any intention of interrupting, but being that they talked so much against my religion and there was so much persecution I lost my head and I felt it was my duty to talk\u201d<ref> Bump Philip, \u201cWhen Nazis rallied in Manhattan, one Working-Class Jewish Man From Brooklyn Took Them on\u201d The Washington Post, February 20, 2019.</ref>When asked about the cause of his actions, Greenbaum quickly rebutted with \u201cGee, what would you have done if you were in my place listening to that s.o.b. hollering against the government and publicly kissing [Adolf] Hitler\u2019s behind - while thousands cheered?

Two months after the rally, the film ''[[Confessions of a Nazi Spy]]'' was released by [[Warner Brothers]], ridiculing the Nazis and their American sympathizers. The Bund also came under investigation. After its financial records were seized in a raid on the group's [[Yorkville, Manhattan]] headquarters, authorities discovered that $14,000 (about $250,000 in 2018 dollars) raised by the Bund in the rally was unaccounted for, having been spent by Kuhn on his mistress and various personal expenses. Kuhn was convicted of [[embezzlement]] in December 1939 and sent to [[Sing Sing prison]].<ref name=\"Hart\"/> Kuhn's successor as Bund leader was Gerhard Wilhelm Kunze, a spy for German military intelligence who fled the United States in November 1941. The final Bund national leader was George Froboese, who was in charge of the organization when [[German declaration of war against the United States|Germany declared war on the United States]].

Alongside allied groups, such as the [[Christian Front (United States)|Christian Front]], these organizations were virulently [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]].<ref name=\"Lederhendler\"/>\n\nThe pro-Nazi organizations in the U.S. were actively countered by anti-Nazi organizations led by [[American Jews]], [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]], and others who opposed Hitlerism and supported a [[Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933|boycott of German goods]].
