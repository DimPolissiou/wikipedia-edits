Their two older children are Erica ([[Hayley Orrantia]]) and Barry ([[Troy Gentile]]). The youngest child, Adam ([[Sean Giambrone]]), documents his family life with his video camera. Beverly's father, Albert \"Pops\" Solomon ([[George Segal]]), is frequently around to provide advice or to help out his grandchildren (often behind his daughter's back).\n\nThe present-day \"Adult Adam\" ([[Patton Oswalt]]) narrates every episode as taking place in \"1980-something\". The show makes references to the era's pop culture in a non-chronological order and each season contains references from throughout the decade.\n\nMany references to real-life Philadelphia-area businesses are made, including the [[Wawa (company)|Wawa]] convenience store chain, [[Gimbel's]] department store, [[Willow Grove Park Mall]], and Kremp's Florist of [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania]]. Additionally, several 1980s cultural icons guest star as themselves on the show and a number of figures from Goldberg's actual life guest star as fictional characters.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Portrayed by\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"7\" | Seasons\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 1)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 2)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 3)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 4)|4]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 5)|5]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 6)|6]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%;\" | [[The Goldbergs (season 7)|7]]\n|-\n|Beverly Goldberg (n\u00e9e Solomon)\n| [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] \n| colspan=7 {{cMain}} \n|-\n|Adam Frederick Goldberg\n|[[Sean Giambrone]]\n| colspan=7 {{cMain}} \n|-\n|Barry Norman Goldberg\n|[[Troy Gentile]]\n| colspan=7 {{cMain}} \n|-\n|Erica Dorothy Goldberg\n|[[Hayley Orrantia]]\n| colspan=7 {{cMain}} \n|-\n|Albert \"Pops\" Solomon\n|[[George Segal]]\n| colspan=7 {{cMain}} \n|-\n|Murray Christian Goldberg\n|[[Jeff Garlin]]\n| colspan=7 {{cMain}} \n|-\n|Lainey Lewis \n|[[AJ Michalka]] \n| colspan=2 {{cRecurring}} \n| colspan=2 {{cMain}} \n| colspan=2 {{cRecurring}}\n| {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| Geoff \"Madman\" Schwartz\n|[[Sam Lerner]] \n| colspan=1 {{n/a|}} \n| colspan=3 {{cRecurring}} \n| colspan=3 {{cMain}} \n<!--Rich is not listed in the opening credits of any episode of 'The Goldbergs', therefore she should not be listed as main cast\n|-\n| Erica \"Valley Erica\" Coolidge\n| Alison Rich \n| colspan=4 {{n/a|}} \n| colspan=1 {{cRecurring}} \n| colspan=1 {{cMain}} \n-->\n|}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Wendi McLendon-Covey]] as Beverly Goldberg (n\u00e9e Solomon),<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/> the overprotective matriarch of the Goldbergs. She is often called their \"smother\" by the kids. She frequently injects herself into her children's lives, often to their embarrassment, and is supremely confident in their abilities.\n* [[Sean Giambrone]] as [[Adam F. Goldberg]],<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/> the pop-culture obsessed youngest child of the Goldbergs. Smart and geeky, he frequently films his family's activities on a VHS camcorder. He often ends up having to use his middle initial to distinguish himself from another Adam Goldberg who attends the same school and is also an aspiring filmmaker.\n* [[Patton Oswalt]] voices the adult Adam Goldberg,<ref>{{cite web|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=TV Review: ''The Goldbergs''|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/reviews/the-goldbergs-TV-review-1200613772/|work=Variety|date=September 17, 2013}}</ref> who narrates the show from the present day.\n* [[Troy Gentile]] as Barry Norman Goldberg,<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/> the overconfident, slightly dim-witted middle child of the Goldbergs. Though seemingly untalented in every way (except in ice hockey and wrestling, at which he excels), he remains highly self-assured while trying to become popular in high school. He is determined to dominate everything he does, especially sports; loves rap music (giving himself the pseudonym \"Big Tasty\"); and is the leader of a crew called the Jenkintown Posse (abbreviated \"JTP\", which fellow members repeat whenever the initials are spoken). In the fifth-season finale, he proposes to Lainey and she accepts, but they don't go through with a wedding. By this point, he decided to become a doctor. Barry graduates from high school in the sixth-season finale, and heads to college in season 7 along with his sister Erica. Barry is based on Adam's real-life brother of the same name.\n* [[Hayley Orrantia]] as Erica Dorothy Goldberg,<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/><ref>stated on driver's license, s5 e7</ref> the sarcastic, somewhat bad-tempered oldest child of the Goldbergs. Smart and musically gifted but rebellious, she is popular in school and dominant over her younger brothers. In the fifth season, Erica left for college at D.C. School of the Arts, only to drop out at the end of the season to start a band with Lainey and Valley Erica. After her music aspirations end up going nowhere, Erica decides to head back to college to get her life back on track. \"Erica\" is based on Adam's real-life brother, Eric Goldberg.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Wojciechowski |first=Michelle \"Wojo\" |date=May 17, 2016 |title=The Goldbergs Creator Adam F.

Though an elderly man with a number of comic eccentricities, he acts much younger than his age and often gives sage advice to his grandchildren. Adam considers him his best friend and they often go on side adventures together. He once owned a successful furniture store called Ottoman Empire that allowed him to retire comfortably, and he now lets his son-in-law Murray run the business.\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Murray Goldberg,<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/> the gruff, somewhat asocial patriarch of the Goldbergs. Unlike Beverly, he is realistic about his children's abilities and believes she smothers them too much. Despite his apathetic tendencies at home, he values hard work and has held various full-time positions since his teenage years. Though he does not always show affection for his children, calling them \"morons\" when they make mistakes or behave in silly ways, he truly cares about them and wants them to learn how to fend for themselves. He runs his father-in-law's furniture business, loves sports, and is often seen lounging in front of his TV in his  white [[briefs]].\n* [[AJ Michalka]] as Lainey Lewis (Season 3&ndash;4; recurring 1&ndash;2, 5&ndash;present),<ref>{{cite web|title=The Goldbergs - Season 5 - AJ Michalka Not Returning as Series Regular|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2017/08/the-goldbergs-season-5-aj-michalka-not.html|website=SpoilerTV|publisher=SpoilerTV|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> Erica's best friend and one of the most popular girls at school, whom Barry has had a lifelong crush on. Lainey is being raised by a single father, Bill, given that her alcoholic mother left them a few years prior to the series. To the surprise of many, Lainey kisses Barry at a party in the first-season finale, the two slowly grow closer together in season two, and eventually become an unlikely couple. Following the fourth season, she has gone to attend fashion school in Savannah, Georgia and ended her relationship with Barry. In season 5, she returns to Jenkintown after dropping out along with Erica to start a band. In the final seconds of the season finale she and Barry agree to wed. In the sixth season, Lainey not only ends the engagement but leaves for L.A. to pursue her dreams alone, but not before promising Barry that when they were ready, they'd be together. Lainey appears as a main character in the spin-off series, ''[[Schooled (TV series)|Schooled]]''.\n* [[Sam Lerner]] as \"Madman\" Geoff Schwartz (Season 5&ndash;present; recurring 2&ndash;4),<ref>{{cite web|title=The Goldbergs - Season 5 - Sam Lerner promoted to regular|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2017/08/the-goldbergs-season-5-sam-lerner.html|website=Spoiler TV|publisher=Spoiler TV|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> one of Barry's best friends, and a member of the \"JTP\". His nickname \"Madman\" is a form of ironic humor, given how well-behaved the character is, especially compared to Barry. He is infatuated with Erica and makes many futile attempts to win her affections. At the end of the third season, he begins dating Evelyn Silver just as Erica realizes she reciprocates Geoff's feelings. He later breaks up with Evey to be with Erica. As Erica prepares to return to college at the start of season 7, Geoff confides that he wants to stay home for a gap year.  After months of following the [[Grateful Dead]] and starting a failed business venture, however, he decides to enroll in college full time, as well as moving in with Erica.\n\n===Recurring cast===\n====Extended family====\n* [[Judd Hirsch]] as Ben \"Pop Pop\" Goldberg, Murray's cantankerous, opinionated father.

In the season 2 finale, it is revealed Dana may be moving to Seattle. The season 3 premiere confirms she is now living in Seattle. Adam and Dana continue a long-distance relationship, but it ends when the two realize how different they have become. Dana returns to Jenkintown in season 7 after her grandmother in Seattle passes away, but makes it clear to Adam that she just wants to be friends. \"Dana\"'s real-life name is Amanda Caldwell; it was changed due to early legal concerns about the show's autobiographical nature.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=April 22, 2014 |title='The Goldbergs' Boss Talks Time Slots, Plans for John Hughes, New Kids Tributes, More |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/goldbergs-boss-talks-time-slots-697442 |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date= |quote=In the beginning, there were a lot of legal concerns about using real people.

Their two older children are Erica ([[Hayley Orrantia]]) and Barry ([[Troy Gentile]]). The youngest child, Adam ([[Sean Giambrone]]), documents his family life with his video camera.

Goldberg]],<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/> the pop-culture obsessed youngest child of the Goldbergs. Smart and geeky, he frequently films his family's activities on a VHS camcorder.

Though seemingly untalented in every way (except in ice hockey and wrestling, at which he excels), he remains highly self-assured while trying to become popular in high school. He is determined to dominate everything he does, especially sports; loves rap music (giving himself the pseudonym \"Big Tasty\"); and is the leader of a crew called the Jenkintown Posse (abbreviated \"JTP\", which fellow members repeat whenever the initials are spoken). In the fifth-season finale, he proposes to Lainey and she accepts, but they don't go through with a wedding. By this point, he decided to become a doctor. Barry graduates from high school in the sixth-season finale, and heads to college in season 7 along with his sister Erica. Barry is based on Adam's real-life brother of the same name.\n* [[Hayley Orrantia]] as Erica Dorothy Goldberg,<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/><ref>stated on driver's license, s5 e7</ref> the sarcastic, somewhat bad-tempered oldest child of the Goldbergs. Smart and musically gifted but rebellious, she is popular in school and dominant over her younger brothers. In the fifth season, Erica left for college at D.C. School of the Arts, only to drop out at the end of the season to start a band with Lainey and Valley Erica. After her music aspirations end up going nowhere, Erica decides to head back to college to get her life back on track. \"Erica\" is based on Adam's real-life brother, Eric Goldberg.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Wojciechowski |first=Michelle \"Wojo\" |date=May 17, 2016 |title=The Goldbergs Creator Adam F.

Though an elderly man with a number of comic eccentricities, he acts much younger than his age and often gives sage advice to his grandchildren. Adam considers him his best friend and they often go on side adventures together. He once owned a successful furniture store called Ottoman Empire that allowed him to retire comfortably, and he now lets his son-in-law Murray run the business.\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Murray Goldberg,<ref name=\"thefutoncritic\"/> the gruff, somewhat asocial patriarch of the Goldbergs. Unlike Beverly, he is realistic about his children's abilities and believes she smothers them too much. Despite his apathetic tendencies at home, he values hard work and has held various full-time positions since his teenage years. Though he does not always show affection for his children, calling them \"morons\" when they make mistakes or behave in silly ways, he truly cares about them and wants them to learn how to fend for themselves. He runs his father-in-law's furniture business, loves sports, and is often seen lounging in front of his TV in his  white [[briefs]].\n* [[AJ Michalka]] as Lainey Lewis (Season 3&ndash;4; recurring 1&ndash;2, 5&ndash;present),<ref>{{cite web|title=The Goldbergs - Season 5 - AJ Michalka Not Returning as Series Regular|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2017/08/the-goldbergs-season-5-aj-michalka-not.html|website=SpoilerTV|publisher=SpoilerTV|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> Erica's best friend and one of the most popular girls at school, whom Barry has had a lifelong crush on. Lainey is being raised by a single father, Bill, given that her alcoholic mother left them a few years prior to the series. To the surprise of many, Lainey kisses Barry at a party in the first-season finale, the two slowly grow closer together in season two, and eventually become an unlikely couple. Following the fourth season, she has gone to attend fashion school in Savannah, Georgia and ended her relationship with Barry. In season 5, she returns to Jenkintown after dropping out along with Erica to start a band. In the final seconds of the season finale she and Barry agree to wed. In the sixth season, Lainey not only ends the engagement but leaves for L.A. to pursue her dreams alone, but not before promising Barry that when they were ready, they'd be together. Lainey appears as a main character in the spin-off series, ''[[Schooled (TV series)|Schooled]]''.\n* [[Sam Lerner]] as \"Madman\" Geoff Schwartz (Season 5&ndash;present; recurring 2&ndash;4),<ref>{{cite web|title=The Goldbergs - Season 5 - Sam Lerner promoted to regular|url=http://www.spoilertv.com/2017/08/the-goldbergs-season-5-sam-lerner.html|website=Spoiler TV|publisher=Spoiler TV|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> one of Barry's best friends, and a member of the \"JTP\". His nickname \"Madman\" is a form of ironic humor, given how well-behaved the character is, especially compared to Barry. He is infatuated with Erica and makes many futile attempts to win her affections. At the end of the third season, he begins dating Evelyn Silver just as Erica realizes she reciprocates Geoff's feelings. He later breaks up with Evey to be with Erica. As Erica prepares to return to college at the start of season 7, Geoff confides that he wants to stay home for a gap year.  After months of following the [[Grateful Dead]] and starting a failed business venture, however, he decides to enroll in college full time, as well as moving in with Erica.\n\n===Recurring cast===\n====Extended family====\n* [[Judd Hirsch]] as Ben \"Pop Pop\" Goldberg, Murray's cantankerous, opinionated father. He frequently fights with Murray, with whom he has trouble communicating, and he views Pops as a rival. (seasons 3-present; Pop Pop first appeared in one season 2 episode, and was portrayed by [[Paul Sorvino]])\n* [[Dan Fogler]] as Marvin Goldberg, Murray's carefree, unreliable younger brother who is frequently involved in bizarre get-rich-quick schemes that always end up failing. (Season 1-present)\n* Lucky: The Goldbergs' pet dog introduced in season 3. While the family originally got the dog based on Barry's insistence for one, Lucky develops a bond with Murray.\n\n====Friends and classmates====\n* [[Natalie Alyn Lind]] as Dana Caldwell, Adam's classmate who becomes his girlfriend.

The regiment was based in [[Visby]] as part of the [[Gotland]] Garrison.\n\n==History==\nThe regiment origins from the Artillery Conscripts of the [[Gotland National Conscription]] (''Gotlands nationalbev\u00e4rings artilleribev\u00e4ring''), which were organized in 1811 as a result of the [[Russian occupation of Gotland 1808|Russian occupation of Gotland]] in 1808 and by a convention adopted by the islanders in December 1810, which was ratified by King [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] on 5 February 1811. It consisted then of two [[Artillery battery|artillery batteries]] and a fortification company with a squad of 100 men, located in Visby.<ref name=\"Westrin (1909), p. 29\">{{harvnb|Westrin|1909|p=29}}</ref> The unit was reorganized in 1861 into Gotland National Conscription Artillery Corps (''Gotlands nationalbev\u00e4rings artillerik\u00e5r'') and was given the designation No&nbsp;4. In 1887 the corps changed its name to Gotland Artillery Corps (No&nbsp;4). The Gotland Artillery Corps was redesignated No&nbsp;7 in 1892 so that the planned [[Norrland Artillery Regiment]] could become  No&nbsp;4. In 1914 the name was changed to A&nbsp;7. In conjunction with the so called OLLI reform, which was carried out by the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] in 1973 and in 1975, A units and B units were created. The A units were regiments responsible for a [[List of Swedish defence districts|defence district]], and the B units were training regiments. In Gotland's case, it distinguished itself from the allotment on the mainland. This when the VII. Military Area was reorganized into [[Gotland Military Command]] (MKG) in 1966. The military command constituted a special [[command and control]] organization within the [[Milo \u00d6|Eastern Military District]], but did not have the overall responsibility for the administration of the island. Furthermore, the professional mobilization was led on a unit level. Through the reform, the full mobilization and material responsibility within the military command was added, regardless of [[military branch]]. This meant that the Gotland Artillery Corps which was included in the Gotland Military Command (MKG) came to be a B unit (training regiment). By the reform, the corps adopted the new name Gotland Artillery Regiment on 1 July 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/D114F167-1E69-4197-A928-3E9207651E85 |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Kungl, Maj:ts proposition 1974:135 |format=PDF |date=25 October 1974 |access-date=23 July 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the Defence Act of 1977 and 1982, the Gotland Artillery Regiment was exempted from the investigation carried out by the National Institute of Defence Organization and Management (''F\u00f6rsvarets rationaliseringsinstitut''). In the Defence Act of 1977, the Gotland Artillery Regiment was exempted because of regional political conditions. Instead the National Institute of Defence Organization and Management believed that the [[Sm\u00e5land Artillery Regiment]] (A 6) with the Artillery Cadet and Aspirant School (''Artilleriets kadett- och aspirantskola'', ArtKAS) as well as the ''Miloverkstaden'' in [[J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping]] would be disbanded. The [[Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces|Supreme Commander]] and the [[Chief of Army (Sweden)|Chief of the Army]], however, believed that no artillery regiment would be disbanded. However, the National Institute of Defence Organization and Management suggested in their investigation to give the Supreme Commander the task of examining the further development of the OLLI organization. In a further development, it wanted to merge [[Gotland Regiment]] (P 18), Gotland Artillery Regiment (A 7) and [[Gotland Anti-Aircraft Corps|Gotland Anti-Aircraft Battalion]] (Lv 2) into an army regiment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/E5003EE2-AF3E-400B-B02E-F4F28CA92D2C |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Regeringens proposition 1977/78:65 |format=PDF |date=17 December 1977 |access-date=23 July 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref> Prior to the Defence Act of 1982, the [[Norrland Artillery Battalion|Boden Artillery Regiment]], Gotland Artillery Regiment, Norrland Artillery Regiment, [[Wendes Artillery Regiment]] and the [[Bergslagen Artillery Regiment]] were exempted from the review of finding a cost reduction within the artillery. The Gotland Artillery Regiment were exempted from the investigation of disbandment, partly because of regional policy considerations but also demands for the war organization's preparedness and mobilization. The merger proposed by the [[Government of Sweden|government]] to the ''[[Riksdag]]'' in the previous act had not been implemented. This meant that the government once again proposed to the ''Riksdag'' to merge the staffs of the Gotland Regiment, Gotland Artillery Regiment and the Gotland Anti-Aircraft Battalion with the staff of the Gotland Military Command, and form an authority from 1 July 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/5C408A58-F445-495E-B182-A1AC549CD246 |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Regeringens proposition 1981/82:102 |format=PDF |date=24 February 1982 |access-date=23 July 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bjurstr\u00f6m||pp=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThrough the Defence Act of 1992, the Gotland Military Command was separated from the Gotland Regiment, Gotland Artillery Regiment and the [[Gotland Anti-Aircraft Corps]], and formed independent units from 1 July 1994. The military command came to only lead all operations on Gotland, which on the mainland were solved by the defense area staffs, division staffs and naval command staffs. Prior to the [[Defence Act of 2000 (Sweden)|Defence Act of 2000]], the government proposed in its Bill 1999/2000:30 that only one artillery regiment would remain in the basic organization. The regiments which the government wanted to disband included Gotland Artillery Regiment. This in the light that the government considered it unsuitable to centralize the artillery training to Gotland, not least due to the investment needs and the limited opportunities for long-term manpower. Remaining in the artillery of the new basic organization was the Bergslagen Artillery Regiment, this because the government considered that to be the regiment which had the best conditions for long-term training and practice of artillery units. On 30 June 2000, the Gotland Artillery Regiment was disbanded.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/proposition/det-nya-forsvaret_GN0330/html |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Regeringens proposition 1999/2000:30 |date=18 November 1999 |access-date=10 July 2016 |format=PDF |language=Swedish}}</ref> On 1 July 2000, the Bergslagen Artillery Regiment took the new name, the [[Artillery Regiment (2000)|Artillery Regiment]].\n\n==Operations==\nIn 1901 the corps was reorganized, and was increased so that it amounted to three batteries and a position company with a strength of 21 officers, 14 non-commissioned officers, four civilian servicemen and 156 male permanent workers.<ref name=\"Westrin (1909), p. 29\"/> In the 1990s, the regiment was responsible for training of divisions artillery staff and battalions and brigade artillery battalions and armored artillery battalion included in the Gotland Military Command (MKG).

The regiment was based in [[Visby]] as part of the [[Gotland]] Garrison.\n\n==History==\nThe regiment origins from the Artillery Conscripts of the [[Gotland National Conscription]] (''Gotlands nationalbev\u00e4rings artilleribev\u00e4ring''), which were organized in 1811 as a result of the [[Russian occupation of Gotland 1808|Russian occupation of Gotland]] in 1808 and by a convention adopted by the islanders in December 1810, which was ratified by King [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] on 5 February 1811. It consisted then of two [[Artillery battery|artillery batteries]] and a fortification company with a squad of 100 men, located in Visby.<ref name=\"Westrin (1909), p. 29\">{{harvnb|Westrin|1909|p=29}}</ref> The unit was reorganized in 1861 into Gotland National Conscription Artillery Corps (''Gotlands nationalbev\u00e4rings artillerik\u00e5r'') and was given the designation No&nbsp;4. In 1887 the corps changed its name to Gotland Artillery Corps (No&nbsp;4). The Gotland Artillery Corps was redesignated No&nbsp;7 in 1892 so that the planned [[Norrland Artillery Regiment]] could become  No&nbsp;4. In 1914 the name was changed to A&nbsp;7. In conjunction with the so called OLLI reform, which was carried out by the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] in 1973 and in 1975, A units and B units were created. The A units were regiments responsible for a [[List of Swedish defence districts|defence district]], and the B units were training regiments. In Gotland's case, it distinguished itself from the allotment on the mainland. This when the VII. Military Area was reorganized into [[Gotland Military Command]] (MKG) in 1966. The military command constituted a special [[command and control]] organization within the [[Milo \u00d6|Eastern Military District]], but did not have the overall responsibility for the administration of the island. Furthermore, the professional mobilization was led on a unit level. Through the reform, the full mobilization and material responsibility within the military command was added, regardless of [[military branch]]. This meant that the Gotland Artillery Corps which was included in the Gotland Military Command (MKG) came to be a B unit (training regiment). By the reform, the corps adopted the new name Gotland Artillery Regiment on 1 July 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/D114F167-1E69-4197-A928-3E9207651E85 |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Kungl, Maj:ts proposition 1974:135 |format=PDF |date=25 October 1974 |access-date=23 July 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the Defence Act of 1977 and 1982, the Gotland Artillery Regiment was exempted from the investigation carried out by the National Institute of Defence Organization and Management (''F\u00f6rsvarets rationaliseringsinstitut''). In the Defence Act of 1977, the Gotland Artillery Regiment was exempted because of regional political conditions. Instead the National Institute of Defence Organization and Management believed that the [[Sm\u00e5land Artillery Regiment]] (A 6) with the Artillery Cadet and Aspirant School (''Artilleriets kadett- och aspirantskola'', ArtKAS) as well as the ''Miloverkstaden'' in [[J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping]] would be disbanded. The [[Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces|Supreme Commander]] and the [[Chief of Army (Sweden)|Chief of the Army]], however, believed that no artillery regiment would be disbanded. However, the National Institute of Defence Organization and Management suggested in their investigation to give the Supreme Commander the task of examining the further development of the OLLI organization. In a further development, it wanted to merge [[Gotland Regiment]] (P 18), Gotland Artillery Regiment (A 7) and [[Gotland Anti-Aircraft Corps|Gotland Anti-Aircraft Battalion]] (Lv 2) into an army regiment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/E5003EE2-AF3E-400B-B02E-F4F28CA92D2C |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Regeringens proposition 1977/78:65 |format=PDF |date=17 December 1977 |access-date=23 July 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref> Prior to the Defence Act of 1982, the [[Norrland Artillery Battalion|Boden Artillery Regiment]], Gotland Artillery Regiment, Norrland Artillery Regiment, [[Wendes Artillery Regiment]] and the [[Bergslagen Artillery Regiment]] were exempted from the review of finding a cost reduction within the artillery. The Gotland Artillery Regiment were exempted from the investigation of disbandment, partly because of regional policy considerations but also demands for the war organization's preparedness and mobilization. The merger proposed by the [[Government of Sweden|government]] to the ''[[Riksdag]]'' in the previous act had not been implemented. This meant that the government once again proposed to the ''Riksdag'' to merge the staffs of the Gotland Regiment, Gotland Artillery Regiment and the Gotland Anti-Aircraft Battalion with the staff of the Gotland Military Command, and form an authority from 1 July 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://data.riksdagen.se/fil/5C408A58-F445-495E-B182-A1AC549CD246 |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Regeringens proposition 1981/82:102 |format=PDF |date=24 February 1982 |access-date=23 July 2016 |language=Swedish}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bjurstr\u00f6m||pp=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThrough the Defence Act of 1992, the Gotland Military Command was separated from the Gotland Regiment, Gotland Artillery Regiment and the [[Gotland Anti-Aircraft Corps]], and formed independent units from 1 July 1994. The military command came to only lead all operations on Gotland, which on the mainland were solved by the defense area staffs, division staffs and naval command staffs. Prior to the [[Defence Act of 2000 (Sweden)|Defence Act of 2000]], the government proposed in its Bill 1999/2000:30 that only one artillery regiment would remain in the basic organization. The regiments which the government wanted to disband included Gotland Artillery Regiment. This in the light that the government considered it unsuitable to centralize the artillery training to Gotland, not least due to the investment needs and the limited opportunities for long-term manpower. Remaining in the artillery of the new basic organization was the Bergslagen Artillery Regiment, this because the government considered that to be the regiment which had the best conditions for long-term training and practice of artillery units. On 30 June 2000, the Gotland Artillery Regiment was disbanded.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/proposition/det-nya-forsvaret_GN0330/html |publisher=[[Riksdag]] |title=Regeringens proposition 1999/2000:30 |date=18 November 1999 |access-date=10 July 2016 |format=PDF |language=Swedish}}</ref> On 1 July 2000, the Bergslagen Artillery Regiment took the new name, the [[Artillery Regiment (2000)|Artillery Regiment]].\n\n==Operations==\nIn 1901 the corps was reorganized, and was increased so that it amounted to three batteries and a position company with a strength of 21 officers, 14 non-commissioned officers, four civilian servicemen and 156 male permanent workers.<ref name=\"Westrin (1909), p. 29\"/> In the 1990s, the regiment was responsible for training of divisions artillery staff and battalions and brigade artillery battalions and armored artillery battalion included in the Gotland Military Command (MKG).

Brain capacity varied widely depending on the population, ranging from {{cvt|546\u20131251|cc}}, and maximum brain size was likely achieved early on in life, equating to a shorter childhood and reduced parental care compared to modern humans. Size also ranged widely from {{cvt|146\u2013185|cm|ftin|sigfig=1}} in height and {{cvt|40\u201368|kg}} in weight. ''H. erectus'' men and women may have been roughly the same size like modern humans, which could indicate [[monogamy]] in line with general trends exhibited in primates. Skin colour potentially varied with location.\n\n''H. erectus'' is associated with the [[Acheulean]] stone tool [[industry (archaeology)|industry]], and is thought to have been the earliest human ancestor capable of using fires, hunting and gathering in coordinated groups, caring for injured or sick group members, seafaring, and possibly art-making. Sites generally show consumption of medium to large animals, such as [[bovine]]s or [[elephant]]s, and a high reliance on meat is associated with increasing brain size. Though groups were more social than ancestor species, it is unclear if ''H. erectus'' was anatomically capable of speech, though it is postulated they communicated using some [[proto-language]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n===Naming===\n{{see|Trinil 2}}\n[[File:Pithecanthropus erectus-PeterMaas Naturalis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Java Man]]]]\nThe first remains, [[Java Man]], were described by Dutch anatomist [[Eug\u00e8ne Dubois]] in 1893, who set out to look for the \"[[missing link (human evolution)|missing link]]\" between apes and humans in Southeast Asia, because he believed [[gibbon]]s to be the closest living relatives to humans in accordance with the \"[[Out of Asia]]\" hypothesis. ''H. erectus'' was the first fossil [[hominin]] found as a result of a directed expedition.\n\nExcavated from the bank of the [[Solo River]] at [[Trinil]], [[East Java]], he first allocated the material to a genus of fossil chimpanzees as ''Anthropopithecus erectus'', then the following year assigned it to a new genus as ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (the genus name had been coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1868 for the hypothetical link between humans and fossil Apes). The species name ''erectus'' was given because the femur suggested that Java Man had been [[biped]]al and walked upright. However, few scientists recognized it as a \"missing link\", and, consequently, Dubois' discovery had been largely disregarded.{{Sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=70}}\n\n[[File:Homo erectus adult female - head model - Smithsonian Museum of Natural History - 2012-05-17.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Forensic reconstruction of an adult female ''Homo erectus''.<ref>Reconstruction by [[John Gurche]] (2010), [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]], based on [[KNM ER 3733]] and [[KNM ER 992|992]].\nAbigail Tucker, \"[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/A-Closer-Look-at-Evolutionary-Faces.html?c=y&page=2&navigation=next#IMAGES A Closer Look at Evolutionary Faces]\", Smithsonian.com, 25 February 2010.</ref>]]\nIn 1921, two teeth from [[Zhoukoudian]], China discovered by [[Johan Gunnar Andersson]] had prompted widely publicized interest.<ref name=\"doorKnock1\">{{cite news |title=The First Knock at the Door |publisher=Peking Man Site Museum |quote=In the summer of 1921, Dr. J.G.

Skin colour potentially varied with location.\n\n''H. erectus'' is associated with the [[Acheulean]] stone tool [[industry (archaeology)|industry]], and is thought to have been the earliest human ancestor capable of using fires, hunting and gathering in coordinated groups, caring for injured or sick group members, seafaring, and possibly art-making. Sites generally show consumption of medium to large animals, such as [[bovine]]s or [[elephant]]s, and a high reliance on meat is associated with increasing brain size. Though groups were more social than ancestor species, it is unclear if ''H. erectus'' was anatomically capable of speech, though it is postulated they communicated using some [[proto-language]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n===Naming===\n{{see|Trinil 2}}\n[[File:Pithecanthropus erectus-PeterMaas Naturalis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Java Man]]]]\nThe first remains, [[Java Man]], were described by Dutch anatomist [[Eug\u00e8ne Dubois]] in 1893, who set out to look for the \"[[missing link (human evolution)|missing link]]\" between apes and humans in Southeast Asia, because he believed [[gibbon]]s to be the closest living relatives to humans in accordance with the \"[[Out of Asia]]\" hypothesis. ''H. erectus'' was the first fossil [[hominin]] found as a result of a directed expedition.\n\nExcavated from the bank of the [[Solo River]] at [[Trinil]], [[East Java]], he first allocated the material to a genus of fossil chimpanzees as ''Anthropopithecus erectus'', then the following year assigned it to a new genus as ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (the genus name had been coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1868 for the hypothetical link between humans and fossil Apes). The species name ''erectus'' was given because the femur suggested that Java Man had been [[biped]]al and walked upright. However, few scientists recognized it as a \"missing link\", and, consequently, Dubois' discovery had been largely disregarded.{{Sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=70}}\n\n[[File:Homo erectus adult female - head model - Smithsonian Museum of Natural History - 2012-05-17.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Forensic reconstruction of an adult female ''Homo erectus''.<ref>Reconstruction by [[John Gurche]] (2010), [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]], based on [[KNM ER 3733]] and [[KNM ER 992|992]].\nAbigail Tucker, \"[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/A-Closer-Look-at-Evolutionary-Faces.html?c=y&page=2&navigation=next#IMAGES A Closer Look at Evolutionary Faces]\", Smithsonian.com, 25 February 2010.</ref>]]\nIn 1921, two teeth from [[Zhoukoudian]], China discovered by [[Johan Gunnar Andersson]] had prompted widely publicized interest.<ref name=\"doorKnock1\">{{cite news |title=The First Knock at the Door |publisher=Peking Man Site Museum |quote=In the summer of 1921, Dr. J.G.

Throughout much of the 20th century, anthropologists debated the role of ''H. erectus'' in [[human evolution]]. Early in the century, due in part to the discoveries at Java and Zhoukoudian, the belief that modern humans first evolved in Asia was widely accepted.
