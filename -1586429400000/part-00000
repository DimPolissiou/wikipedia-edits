Emily's story is compelling.  If you've met Emily... you cant help but become engaged and energized.\"  Emily said in that piece, \"Obviously our prayer and dream is to have a breakthrough.  But we also realize that it might not happen, or it might not happen in time for me.

But we also realize that it might not happen, or it might not happen in time for me.
