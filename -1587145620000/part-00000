Anejom\u0303 falls under the [[Southern Oceanic languages|Southern Oceanic Languages]] subgroup, and more specifically Southern Vanuatuan Languages.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  It constitutes its own separate branch of Southern Vanuatuan languages.  While Anejom\u0303 is now considered to be only one language, some historical reports have suggested that Anejom\u0303 might have consisted of two very distinct dialects.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Linguistic History of Southern Vanuatu|last=Lynch|first=John|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|year=2001|isbn=|location=Canberra, Australia|pages=5}}</ref>  Its closest relatives are preliminarily thought to be more closely related to the languages of Tanna (e.g. Kwamera, South-West Tanna, Lenakel) than Erromango languages.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:New Hebrides.JPG|thumb|Map of Vanuatu (Formerly known as the New Hebrides)|left]]\nThe island of Aneityum is the southernmost inhabited island of the nation of Vanuatu.  It is closest to the islands of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]] and [[Futuna Island, Vanuatu|Futuna]].<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  The island's geographic location made Anejom\u0303 develop in isolation.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  The first speakers of the language are believed to have lived on hillsides near coasts in order to access resources.  However, due to land degradation and population pressure, the speakers moved to the valleys.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History ==\nAneityum is thought to have been settled around 874 BCE +/- 60 years by people coming over from Tanna.  Original settlers (and speakers of the language) are thought to have lived on hillsides near the coasts in order to access resources from the ocean and land.<ref group=gr name=\":9\" group=gr>{{Page numbers|1}}</ref>  However, the combination of land degradation and population forced the Aneityumese to move onto valley flats instead.<ref group=gr name=\":9\" />\n\nThe original political system was like much of Melanesia; it was composed of multiple chiefs (''natimarid)'' ruling over many chiefdoms (''neclau'').<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  According to oral tradition, the island had two chiefdoms but they split to then form seven chiefdoms each \"further divided into a number of districts between fifty and sixty in number\".<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first contact with Europeans was in 1830, when the brig ''Alpha'' landed in Aneityum with hopes of establishing a sandalwood trading business.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />\n\nThe population of the Aneityumese has greatly declined over the years (along with the number of speakers); however, the population has seen a bit of a resurgence in the present.  Most of the population was decimated by two major epidemics in the 1830s and 1840s and never fully recovered as can be seen below:<ref group=gr>{{Page numbers|3}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Aneityum population\n|-\n!Pre-Contact\n|9,000-20,000\n!1905\n|435\n|-\n!1830\n|4,600-5,800\n!1917\n|320\n|-\n!1854\n|3,800\n!1926\n|220\n|-\n!1865\n|2,100\n!1936\n|193\n|-\n!1878\n|1,279\n!1947\n|191\n|-\n!1886\n|930\n!1957\n|244\n|-\n!1897\n|527\n!1967\n|313\n|}\n\n=== Church Presence ===\nLike much of the rest of Melanesia, the church has played an important role in language ideology on Aneityum.  The first missionaries to land on the island were Samoan Presbyterians who arrived in 1841.  After them followed European Presbyterian missionaries who established themselves in 1848.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  With the large missionary presence on the island, many schools were founded to spread the message of Christianity.  In these schools, the classroom was mainly conducted in Anejom\u0303, however numeracy was conducted in English.<ref name=\":30\">Lynch, John Dominic. Church, State and Language in Melanesia: An Inaugural Lecture. Papua New Guinea: U of Papua New Guinea, 1979.</ref>  The missionary presence on the island was so prevalent that the island was considered the \"first successfully missionized island in Melanesia\" and housed the headquarters of the Presbyterian Mission to the New Hebrides.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe missions on Aneityum promoted the use of English.\n\n=== Colonialization ===\nVanuatu came under joint British and French rule in 1887, which then became formalized in 1906 where Vanuatu became known as the \"Anglo-French Condominium\".  Colonialization along with the big mission presence on the island led to the languages of French and English to become prestige languages.<ref name=\":30\" />  Other languages of Vanuatu also became prestigious (such as Nguna) because these language were chosen by missionaries to spread their teachings.<ref name=\":30\" />  With prolonged contact with English speakers, another language also arose: Bislama.

While Anejom\u0303 is now considered to be only one language, some historical reports have suggested that Anejom\u0303 might have consisted of two very distinct dialects.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Linguistic History of Southern Vanuatu|last=Lynch|first=John|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|year=2001|isbn=|location=Canberra, Australia|pages=5}}</ref>  Its closest relatives are preliminarily thought to be more closely related to the languages of Tanna (e.g. Kwamera, South-West Tanna, Lenakel) than Erromango languages.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:New Hebrides.JPG|thumb|Map of Vanuatu (Formerly known as the New Hebrides)|left]]\nThe island of Aneityum is the southernmost inhabited island of the nation of Vanuatu.  It is closest to the islands of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]] and [[Futuna Island, Vanuatu|Futuna]].<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  The island's geographic location made Anejom\u0303 develop in isolation.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  The first speakers of the language are believed to have lived on hillsides near coasts in order to access resources.  However, due to land degradation and population pressure, the speakers moved to the valleys.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History ==\nAneityum is thought to have been settled around 874 BCE +/- 60 years by people coming over from Tanna.  Original settlers (and speakers of the language) are thought to have lived on hillsides near the coasts in order to access resources from the ocean and land.<ref group=gr name=\":9\" group=gr>{{Page numbers|1}}</ref>  However, the combination of land degradation and population forced the Aneityumese to move onto valley flats instead.<ref group=gr name=\":9\" />\n\nThe original political system was like much of Melanesia; it was composed of multiple chiefs (''natimarid)'' ruling over many chiefdoms (''neclau'').<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  According to oral tradition, the island had two chiefdoms but they split to then form seven chiefdoms each \"further divided into a number of districts between fifty and sixty in number\".<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first contact with Europeans was in 1830, when the brig ''Alpha'' landed in Aneityum with hopes of establishing a sandalwood trading business.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />\n\nThe population of the Aneityumese has greatly declined over the years (along with the number of speakers); however, the population has seen a bit of a resurgence in the present.  Most of the population was decimated by two major epidemics in the 1830s and 1840s and never fully recovered as can be seen below:<ref group=gr>{{Page numbers|3}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Aneityum population\n|-\n!Pre-Contact\n|9,000-20,000\n!1905\n|435\n|-\n!1830\n|4,600-5,800\n!1917\n|320\n|-\n!1854\n|3,800\n!1926\n|220\n|-\n!1865\n|2,100\n!1936\n|193\n|-\n!1878\n|1,279\n!1947\n|191\n|-\n!1886\n|930\n!1957\n|244\n|-\n!1897\n|527\n!1967\n|313\n|}\n\n=== Church Presence ===\nLike much of the rest of Melanesia, the church has played an important role in language ideology on Aneityum.  The first missionaries to land on the island were Samoan Presbyterians who arrived in 1841.  After them followed European Presbyterian missionaries who established themselves in 1848.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  With the large missionary presence on the island, many schools were founded to spread the message of Christianity.  In these schools, the classroom was mainly conducted in Anejom\u0303, however numeracy was conducted in English.<ref name=\":30\">Lynch, John Dominic. Church, State and Language in Melanesia: An Inaugural Lecture.

Compounding is so prevalent, that historical linguistics use modern (as well as [[Fossilization (linguistics)|fossilized]] compounds) to trace genealogical relationships between Oceanic languages.  Another one of the key uses of compounding in Anejom\u0303, is it is used to form the instrumental case.

The preferred word order in Anejom\u0303 is VOS (or verb, followed by object, then subject).

But the east-west distinction is of limited meaning for Avestan, as the linguistic developments that later distinguish Eastern from Western Iranian had not yet occurred. Avestan does not display some typical (South-)Western Iranian innovations already visible in Old Persian, and so in this sense, \"eastern\" only means \"non-western\".<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eastern-iranian-languages Encyclopaedia Iranica: EASTERN IRANIAN LANGUAGES.

AVESTAN LANGUAGE. III. The grammar of Avestan.: \"The morphology of Avestan nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs is, like that of the closely related Old Persian, inherited from Proto-Indo-European via Proto-Indo-Iranian (Proto-Aryan), and agrees largely with that of Vedic, the oldest known form of Indo-Aryan. The interpretation of the transmitted Avestan texts presents in many cases considerable difficulty for various reasons, both with respect to their contexts and their grammar. Accordingly, systematic comparison with Vedic is of much assistance in determining and explaining Avestan grammatical forms.\"</ref> The old ancestor dialect of [[Pashto]] was close to the language of the [[Gathas]].<ref>\nMorgenstierne, G. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/afghanistan-vi-pasto Encyclopaedia Iranica: AFGHANISTAN vi. Pa\u1e67to] \"it seems that the Old Iranic ancestor dialect of Pa\u1e67t\u014d must have been close to that of the Gathas.\"\n</ref>\n\n==Forms and stages of development==\nThe Avestan language is attested in roughly two forms, known as \"Old Avestan\" (or \"Gathic Avestan\") and \"Younger Avestan\". Younger Avestan did not evolve from Old Avestan; the two differ not only in time, but are also different dialects.\nEvery Avestan text, regardless of whether originally composed in Old or Younger Avestan, underwent several transformations. [[Karl Hoffmann (linguist)|Karl Hoffmann]] traced the following stages for Avestan as found in the extant texts. In roughly chronological order:\n* The natural language of the composers of the ''[[Gathas]]'', the ''[[Yasna Haptanghaiti]]'', the four sacred prayers (''Y.'' 27 and 54).\n* Changes precipitated by slow chanting\n* Changes to Old Avestan due to transmission by native speakers of Younger Avestan\n* The natural language of the scribes who wrote grammatically correct Younger Avestan texts\n* Deliberate changes introduced through \"standardization\"\n* Changes introduced by transfer to regions where Avestan was not spoken\n* Adaptions/translations of portions of texts from other regions\n* Composition of ungrammatical late Avestan texts\n* [[Phonetic notation]] of the Avestan texts in the [[Avestan alphabet#History|Sas<!--technical name, do not change -->anian archetype]]\n* Post-Sasanian deterioration of the written transmission due to incorrect pronunciation\n* Errors and corruptions introduced during copying\nMany phonetic features cannot be ascribed with certainty to a particular stage since there may be more than one possibility. Every phonetic form that can be ascribed to the Sas<!-- this is inside a literal quotation -->anian archetype on the basis of critical assessment of the manuscript evidence must have gone through the stages mentioned above so that \"Old Avestan\" and \"Young Avestan\" really mean no more than \"Old Avestan and Young Avestan of the [[Sassanid empire|Sas<!-- this is inside a literal quotation -->anian period]].\"<ref name=\"Hoffmann_EIr\" />\n\n==Alphabet==\n{{Main|Avestan alphabet}}\nThe script used for writing Avestan developed during the 3rd or 4th century AD. By then the language had been extinct for many centuries, and remained in use only as a liturgical language of the Avesta canon. As is still the case today, the liturgies were memorized by the priesthood and recited by rote.\n\nThe script devised to render Avestan was natively known as ''[[Avestan alphabet|Din dabireh]]'' \"religion writing\". It has 53 distinct characters and is written right-to-left. Among the 53 characters are about 30 letters that are&nbsp;\u2013 through the addition of various loops and flourishes&nbsp;\u2013 variations of the 13 graphemes of the [[Pahlavi scripts|cursive Pahlavi script]] (i.e. \"Book\" Pahlavi) that is known from the post-Sassanian texts of Zoroastrian tradition. These symbols, like those of all the Pahlavi scripts, are in turn based on [[Aramaic script]] symbols. Avestan also incorporates several letters from other writing systems, most notably the vowels, which are mostly derived from Greek minuscules. A few letters were free inventions, as were also the symbols used for punctuation. Also, the Avestan alphabet has one letter that has no corresponding sound in the Avestan language; the character for {{IPA|/l/}} (a sound that Avestan does not have) was added to write [[Pazend]] texts.\n\nThe Avestan script is [[alphabet]]ic, and the large number of letters suggests that its design was due to the need to render the orally recited texts with high phonetic precision. The correct enunciation of the liturgies was (and still is) considered necessary for the prayers to be effective.\n\nThe Zoroastrians of India, who represent one of the largest surviving Zoroastrian communities worldwide, also transcribe Avestan in [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Brahmi]]-based scripts. This is a relatively recent development first seen in the ca. 12th century texts of Neryosang Dhaval and other Parsi Sanskritist theologians of that era, which are roughly contemporary with the oldest surviving manuscripts in Avestan script. Today, Avestan is most commonly typeset in the [[Gujarati script]] ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] being the traditional language of the Indian Zoroastrians). Some Avestan letters with no corresponding symbol are synthesized with additional diacritical marks, for example, the {{IPA|/z/}} in ''zara\u03d1u\u0161tra'' is written with ''j'' with a dot below.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Avestan phonology}}\nAvestan has retained voiced sibilants, and has fricative rather than aspirate series. There are various conventions for transliteration of D\u012bn Dabireh, the one adopted for this article being:\n\nVowels:\n:a \u0101 \u0259 \u0259\u0304 e \u0113 o \u014d \u00e5 \u0105 i \u012b u \u016b\nConsonants:\n:k g \u03b3 x x\u02b7 \u010d \u01f0 t d \u03b4 \u03d1 t\u0330 p b \u03b2 f\n:\u014b \u014b\u02b7 \u1e47 \u0144 n m y w r s z \u0161 \u1e63\u030c \u017e h\n\nThe glides ''y'' and ''w'' are often transcribed as ''ii'' and ''uu'', imitating D\u012bn Dabireh orthography. The letter transcribed ''t\u0330'' indicates an allophone of {{IPA|/t/}} with [[no audible release]] at the end of a word and before certain [[obstruent]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mark |last=Hale |authorlink=Mark Hale |chapter=Avestan |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages |editor=Roger D.

Pa\u1e67to] \"it seems that the Old Iranic ancestor dialect of Pa\u1e67t\u014d must have been close to that of the Gathas.\"\n</ref>\n\n==Forms and stages of development==\nThe Avestan language is attested in roughly two forms, known as \"Old Avestan\" (or \"Gathic Avestan\") and \"Younger Avestan\". Younger Avestan did not evolve from Old Avestan; the two differ not only in time, but are also different dialects.\nEvery Avestan text, regardless of whether originally composed in Old or Younger Avestan, underwent several transformations. [[Karl Hoffmann (linguist)|Karl Hoffmann]] traced the following stages for Avestan as found in the extant texts. In roughly chronological order:\n* The natural language of the composers of the ''[[Gathas]]'', the ''[[Yasna Haptanghaiti]]'', the four sacred prayers (''Y.'' 27 and 54).\n* Changes precipitated by slow chanting\n* Changes to Old Avestan due to transmission by native speakers of Younger Avestan\n* The natural language of the scribes who wrote grammatically correct Younger Avestan texts\n* Deliberate changes introduced through \"standardization\"\n* Changes introduced by transfer to regions where Avestan was not spoken\n* Adaptions/translations of portions of texts from other regions\n* Composition of ungrammatical late Avestan texts\n* [[Phonetic notation]] of the Avestan texts in the [[Avestan alphabet#History|Sas<!--technical name, do not change -->anian archetype]]\n* Post-Sasanian deterioration of the written transmission due to incorrect pronunciation\n* Errors and corruptions introduced during copying\nMany phonetic features cannot be ascribed with certainty to a particular stage since there may be more than one possibility. Every phonetic form that can be ascribed to the Sas<!-- this is inside a literal quotation -->anian archetype on the basis of critical assessment of the manuscript evidence must have gone through the stages mentioned above so that \"Old Avestan\" and \"Young Avestan\" really mean no more than \"Old Avestan and Young Avestan of the [[Sassanid empire|Sas<!-- this is inside a literal quotation -->anian period]].\"<ref name=\"Hoffmann_EIr\" />\n\n==Alphabet==\n{{Main|Avestan alphabet}}\nThe script used for writing Avestan developed during the 3rd or 4th century AD. By then the language had been extinct for many centuries, and remained in use only as a liturgical language of the Avesta canon. As is still the case today, the liturgies were memorized by the priesthood and recited by rote.\n\nThe script devised to render Avestan was natively known as ''[[Avestan alphabet|Din dabireh]]'' \"religion writing\". It has 53 distinct characters and is written right-to-left. Among the 53 characters are about 30 letters that are&nbsp;\u2013 through the addition of various loops and flourishes&nbsp;\u2013 variations of the 13 graphemes of the [[Pahlavi scripts|cursive Pahlavi script]] (i.e. \"Book\" Pahlavi) that is known from the post-Sassanian texts of Zoroastrian tradition. These symbols, like those of all the Pahlavi scripts, are in turn based on [[Aramaic script]] symbols. Avestan also incorporates several letters from other writing systems, most notably the vowels, which are mostly derived from Greek minuscules. A few letters were free inventions, as were also the symbols used for punctuation. Also, the Avestan alphabet has one letter that has no corresponding sound in the Avestan language; the character for {{IPA|/l/}} (a sound that Avestan does not have) was added to write [[Pazend]] texts.\n\nThe Avestan script is [[alphabet]]ic, and the large number of letters suggests that its design was due to the need to render the orally recited texts with high phonetic precision. The correct enunciation of the liturgies was (and still is) considered necessary for the prayers to be effective.\n\nThe Zoroastrians of India, who represent one of the largest surviving Zoroastrian communities worldwide, also transcribe Avestan in [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Brahmi]]-based scripts. This is a relatively recent development first seen in the ca. 12th century texts of Neryosang Dhaval and other Parsi Sanskritist theologians of that era, which are roughly contemporary with the oldest surviving manuscripts in Avestan script. Today, Avestan is most commonly typeset in the [[Gujarati script]] ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] being the traditional language of the Indian Zoroastrians). Some Avestan letters with no corresponding symbol are synthesized with additional diacritical marks, for example, the {{IPA|/z/}} in ''zara\u03d1u\u0161tra'' is written with ''j'' with a dot below.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Avestan phonology}}\nAvestan has retained voiced sibilants, and has fricative rather than aspirate series. There are various conventions for transliteration of D\u012bn Dabireh, the one adopted for this article being:\n\nVowels:\n:a \u0101 \u0259 \u0259\u0304 e \u0113 o \u014d \u00e5 \u0105 i \u012b u \u016b\nConsonants:\n:k g \u03b3 x x\u02b7 \u010d \u01f0 t d \u03b4 \u03d1 t\u0330 p b \u03b2 f\n:\u014b \u014b\u02b7 \u1e47 \u0144 n m y w r s z \u0161 \u1e63\u030c \u017e h\n\nThe glides ''y'' and ''w'' are often transcribed as ''ii'' and ''uu'', imitating D\u012bn Dabireh orthography. The letter transcribed ''t\u0330'' indicates an allophone of {{IPA|/t/}} with [[no audible release]] at the end of a word and before certain [[obstruent]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mark |last=Hale |authorlink=Mark Hale |chapter=Avestan |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages |editor=Roger D.

Loyalty programs reward cardholders with benefits as they buy more merchandise.}}</ref> Cards may have a [[barcode]] or [[magstripe]] to more easily allow for scanning, although some are [[chip card]]s or [[proximity card]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title = Customer's loyalty system and point cards|url = http://www.kimaldi.com/kimaldi_eng/sectors/retail/customers_loyalty_system_and_point_cards|website=kimaldi.com}}</ref>\n\nBy presenting a card, customers typically receive either a discount on the current purchase, or an allotment of points that they can use for future purchases. Hence, the card is the visible means of implementing a type of what economists call a [[two-part tariff]]. Application forms for cards usually entail agreements by the store concerning customer privacy, typically non-disclosure (by the store) of non-aggregate data about customers. The store uses aggregate data internally (and sometimes externally) as part of its [[marketing research]]. Over time the data can reveal, for example, a given customer's favorite brand of beer, or whether he or she is a vegetarian. Where a customer has provided sufficient identifying information, the loyalty card may also be used to access such information to expedite verification during receipt of cheques or dispensing [[medical prescription]] preparations, or for other membership privileges such as access to an [[airport lounge]] using a [[frequent-flyer program|frequent-flyer]] card. In recent years, businesses now offer these loyalty cards in the form of a loyalty app, which means users are less likely to lose their card. Almost all major casino chains also have loyalty cards, which offer members tier credits, reward credits, [[Comps (casino)|comps]], and other perks based on card members' \"[[Comps (casino)#Calculation|theo]]\" from gambling, various demographic data, and spend patterns on various purchases at the casino, within the casino network, and with the casino's partners.<ref>{{cite web|website=Limn|title=Issue 2 Crowds and Clouds \u00bb THE TOUCH-POINT COLLECTIVE: CROWD CONTOURING ON THE CASINO FLOOR|author=Dow, Natasha|url=https://limn.it/articles/the-touch-point-collective-crowd-contouring-on-the-casino-floor/|date=26 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=Lifehacker|url=https://lifehacker.com/how-casinos-use-rewards-programs-to-track-everything-yo-1830864482|title=How Casinos Use Rewards Programs to Track Everything You Do|author=Long, Emily|date=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=PennsylvaniaOnlineCasinos.com|author=Derbyshire, Martin|title=Best Casino Loyalty Programs For People Who Go Outside of PA To Play|date=22 May 2018|url=https://pennsylvaniaonlinecasinos.com/1625/pa-casino-loyalty-traveler/}}</ref> Examples of such programs include [[Caesars Entertainment Corporation|Caesars]] Rewards<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.caesars.com/total-rewards|website=Caesars.com|title=Caesars Rewards}}</ref> (formerly called Total Rewards<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lasvegashowto.com/total-rewards|website=Las Vegas How To|title=Total Rewards Card}}</ref>) and [[MGM Resorts International]]'s Mlife.<ref>{{cite web|website=MGM Resorts|title=Mlife|url=https://www.mgmresorts.com/en/mlife-rewards-program.html}}</ref>\n\nLoyalty programs have been described as a form of centralized [[virtual currency]], one with unidirectional cash flow, since reward points can be exchanged into a [[Goods and services|good or service]] but not into cash.<ref name=ECB>{{cite book|title = Virtual Currency Schemes| date = October 2012|publisher = European Central Bank|location = Frankfurt am Main|isbn = 978-92-899-0862-7|page = 5| chapter-url = http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf|author = European Central Bank| accessdate = 5 March 2014|chapter = 1}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n:''For information on historical loyalty programs, see [[Loyalty marketing#History|Loyalty marketing history]].''\n\n==By continent and country==\n\n===Asia===\n====Mainland China====\nThe [[Social Credit System]] is a loyalty program operated by the state and private businesses.

This is regarded as having been the prototype for such schemes in Europe. However, loyalty cards did not expand until 1997, when [[Tesco Ireland]] introduced its Clubcard scheme, shortly after its purchase of Power Supermarkets. This was an expansion of the UK scheme\u2014cards for this are identical to those used by Tesco in the UK and can be used in both countries. [[Dunnes Stores]] responded with the introduction of their own ValueClub scheme in June 1997. Today these are three main schemes operating in Ireland, although ValueClub has been withdrawn from Dunnes' [[Northern Ireland]] stores. [[SuperValu (Ireland)|SuperValu]] has introduced their own loyalty club called Real Rewards.\n\nAll five major [[petrol station]] chains in the country operated a scheme during the late 1990s\u2014[[Esso]] had Tiger Miles (with Tesco ClubCard points offered as an alternative), [[Maxol]] had Points Plus, both of which operated on the principle of getting items from a gift catalogue, with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] using Dunnes' scheme, [[Texaco]] using the SuperQuinn system, and [[Statoil]] operating a cash-back system, Premium Club. Due to increasing oil prices and tightening of margins, these schemes ended by the end of 2005. Tesco Ireland's petrol stations still, however, give Clubcard points.\n\n[[Game (retailer)|Game]], a major computer game and hardware retailer also operate a cashback card scheme, which was merged with [[Electronics Boutique]]'s programme following the separation of their northern European stores into the hands of Game.

It was founded in November 2011 by parent hotel management company PREM Group, who is based in Dublin, Ireland. This program does not issue loyalty cards but does everything electronically through email. This company has over 33 participating hotels and serviced apartments.

This was replaced by the [[Nectar loyalty card|Nectar card]] in 2002, which was launched in partnership with other major brands.\n\n[[Boots UK]] began planning a loyalty card in November 1993, but building a CRM-focussed loyalty program. With an investment in excess of [[GB\u00a3]]30 million, the Boots Advantage Card, launched in 1997, is the largest smart card retail loyalty card scheme in the world, and the third-largest retail loyalty scheme in the UK in terms of cards issued.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} The Advantage scheme has 16.4 million cardholders using the card online and in store and at 3rd party retailers.  The scheme gives a cardholder four points for every pound spent in a Boots store under normal shopping circumstances.  Most stores have kiosks which can be used in conjunction with the cards for \"exclusive offers\" which are printed on vouchers and can be used at the till.  These vouchers enable money off specific purchases, extra points for specific purchases, or money off or extra points when spending has reached an amount specified on the voucher, or other offers such as double points on either everything of specific products.  For example, a customer may get a voucher which provides 250 extra points when they have spent \u00a350 in one transaction.  Points equal pence in store, and can be spent at any time and on anything in store, providing the card has enough points to cover the entire cost of the merchandise. The kiosk system was replaced with the Boots App in 2014, where customers can automatically load offers on to their Advantage Card straight from their smartphone.\n\n[[Safeway plc|Safeway's]] ABC Card was discontinued in 2000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Safeway scraps loyalty card|date=5 May 2000|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 July 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/735835.stm}}</ref> Airlines, Hotels and other loyalty schemes also offer cards.

[[Game (retailer)|Game]] has a reward card scheme for which every pound spent a customer is rewarded 10 points; for every 1000 points that one collects, one gets \u00a32.50 to redeem in the store, or online.

Instead, as [[consumer co-operative]]s, they operate a profit sharing scheme whereby an annual [[dividend]] is paid to all member-owners which is proportional to the total spend with the businesses during the previous year. Such dividend schemes have existed since the [[Rochdale Pioneers]] of the 1840s. Paper record-keeping transformed in the 1960s into a [[trading stamp]] scheme managed by the [[Co-operative Wholesale Society]] (CWS), which was gradually withdrawn as margins declined.  The loyalty card concept was used by some co-operatives to restore dividend payments at the turn of the 21st century, notably by the CWS's \"Dividend\" card, which was replaced by [[The Co-operative Group#Dividend|The Co-operative Membership]] card program. The current members' dividend scheme is provided using the national [[The Co-operative brand|co-operative brand]] and allows members of [[The Co-operative Group]] and many of the larger regional co-operative societies to earn their 'share of the profits' based upon their spend at many of the outlets which use [[The Co-operative brand]] rather than just at their own co-operative society (e.g. [[The Co-operative Group]] or the [[Midcounties Co-operative]]).\n\nFormerly operated by [[British Airways]], [[Air Miles|Airmiles]] was the most popular flight-related loyalty program in the UK, with 2.2. million members in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Airmiles members lose free flights as loyalty scheme adds taxes of up to \u00a3600|url = http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/holidays/article-2032886/Airmiles-members-lose-free-flights-loyalty-scheme-rebrands-Avios.html|website = This is Money|accessdate = 10 December 2015}}</ref> Members could collect Airmiles each time they flew with British Airways or affiliated airlines, both within the [[International Airlines Group]] and the [[Oneworld|Oneworld Alliance]]; points could then be redeemed for flights, and was popular with both commercial and business customers.

[[PC Optimum]] is the loyalty program used by [[Loblaw Companies]]-owned entities, including [[Shopper's Drug Mart]], with the points redeemable against any purchase in $10 increments. [[More Rewards]] was founded in 1992 operates mostly in the Western Canadian provinces with close relations to its grocery partnerships with the [[Overwaitea Food Group]] and its small coalition of other retailers. [[Aeroplan]] began in 1984 as [[Air Canada]]'s frequent flier program, but has since expanded to other partners. Department store chains [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson's Bay]] and [[La Maison Simons]] both operate loyalty programs, in addition to the drug store chain [[London Drugs]]. Other notable programs include [[Scene (loyalty program)|Scene]] by the movie theatre chain [[Cineplex Entertainment]] and Plum Rewards by the bookseller [[Indigo Books and Music|Indigo]].\n\nAlmost every gas station chain in Canada offers some sort of loyalty program itself or in partnership. For example, Air Miles at [[Shell Canada|Shell]] gas stations, PC Optimum at [[Imperial Oil|Esso]] and Mobil, Petro Points + More Rewards at [[Petro-Canada]], and [[Triangle Rewards]] at Canadian Tire gas stations.\n\n====United States====\nIn the US, several major retail chains, movie theatre networks, supermarket and fish market chains, and the three major pharmacy chains<ref>{{cite web|accessdate= 2 September 2011|website=Stop and Shop|title=Stop & Shop Card Holders Can Save $10 on Seasonal Immunization|date=10 September 2009|url=http://www.stopandshop.com/about_us/news_media/press_release.htm?p=467c3411-072c-4030-86a6-aae7506d8567}}</ref> require the cards in order for customers to receive the advertised loyalty price.

Some have tie-ins with airline [[frequent-flyer program]]s, and some agree to donate a percentage of sales to a designated charity. Most notably, [[Walmart]] does not have a loyalty card plan, although anyone who purchases a gift card can generally get a 3-cent discount per gallon of gas at the [[Murphy USA|fuel stations located on Walmart premises]], in the 23 states with those Walmart fuel stations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2012/08/29/walmart-pumps-up-savings-on-gas-with-15-cents-per-gallon-discount|title=Walmart Pumps Up Savings on Gas with 15 Cents per Gallon Discount|website=Corporate - US|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\nThe practice is common among book and music retailers, from large chains to independent retailers. In some instances, the customer purchases the card and receives a percentage discount on all purchases for a period of time (often one year), while in other instances, a customer receives a one-time percentage discount upon reaching a specified purchase level. For example, a bookseller's loyalty card program might provide a customer with a 10% off coupon once the customer has spent [[US$]]200 at the bookseller. [[Best Buy]] and [[Sears]] offer loyalty programs that offer points redeemable for dollar-amount discounts after accumulating a set number of points along with other discounts from time to time.\n\nIndependent hardware stores, such as [[Ace Hardware]] and [[True Value]], added customer loyalty programs in order to compete more effectively against larger chains as well as gather customer data. Customers with an association with a particular brand feel benefits for being part of the program. Ace's program also offers customers a way at the time of purchase to get items at a price which would normally require completing a mail-in rebate. In addition, [[office supply]] retailers [[Staples, Inc.|Staples]] and [[Office Depot]] started issuing club cards in 2005: they offer rewards in the form of credits towards future purchases on items purchased in the store or online (which items and how much credit changes periodically).\n\nAlmost all major hotel chains ([[Best Western]], [[Choice Hotels]], [[Holiday Inn]], [[Marriott International|Marriott]], [[Super 8 Worldwide|Super 8 Motels]], etc.) have cards that allow guests to earn either points (redeemable for discounts, future stays, or other prizes) and/or airline miles [[Hilton Hotels Corporation|Hilton]]'s [[Hilton HHonors|HHonors]] program allowed guests to earn both points and miles (referenced as double-dipping) on the same stay, the only program to date that did so but which ended 1 April 2018]. All major U.S. airlines also offer rewards credit cards. Other travel related reward programs include SeaMiles, with points that can be redeemed for cruises.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-28977082/ | title=Article|work=Los Angeles Times | date=14 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nSome American retailers have not implemented club cards, including grocery stores [[ALDI]], [[Publix]], and [[Whole Foods]].

Hence, the card is the visible means of implementing a type of what economists call a [[two-part tariff]]. Application forms for cards usually entail agreements by the store concerning customer privacy, typically non-disclosure (by the store) of non-aggregate data about customers. The store uses aggregate data internally (and sometimes externally) as part of its [[marketing research]]. Over time the data can reveal, for example, a given customer's favorite brand of beer, or whether he or she is a vegetarian. Where a customer has provided sufficient identifying information, the loyalty card may also be used to access such information to expedite verification during receipt of cheques or dispensing [[medical prescription]] preparations, or for other membership privileges such as access to an [[airport lounge]] using a [[frequent-flyer program|frequent-flyer]] card. In recent years, businesses now offer these loyalty cards in the form of a loyalty app, which means users are less likely to lose their card. Almost all major casino chains also have loyalty cards, which offer members tier credits, reward credits, [[Comps (casino)|comps]], and other perks based on card members' \"[[Comps (casino)#Calculation|theo]]\" from gambling, various demographic data, and spend patterns on various purchases at the casino, within the casino network, and with the casino's partners.<ref>{{cite web|website=Limn|title=Issue 2 Crowds and Clouds \u00bb THE TOUCH-POINT COLLECTIVE: CROWD CONTOURING ON THE CASINO FLOOR|author=Dow, Natasha|url=https://limn.it/articles/the-touch-point-collective-crowd-contouring-on-the-casino-floor/|date=26 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=Lifehacker|url=https://lifehacker.com/how-casinos-use-rewards-programs-to-track-everything-yo-1830864482|title=How Casinos Use Rewards Programs to Track Everything You Do|author=Long, Emily|date=6 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=PennsylvaniaOnlineCasinos.com|author=Derbyshire, Martin|title=Best Casino Loyalty Programs For People Who Go Outside of PA To Play|date=22 May 2018|url=https://pennsylvaniaonlinecasinos.com/1625/pa-casino-loyalty-traveler/}}</ref> Examples of such programs include [[Caesars Entertainment Corporation|Caesars]] Rewards<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.caesars.com/total-rewards|website=Caesars.com|title=Caesars Rewards}}</ref> (formerly called Total Rewards<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lasvegashowto.com/total-rewards|website=Las Vegas How To|title=Total Rewards Card}}</ref>) and [[MGM Resorts International]]'s Mlife.<ref>{{cite web|website=MGM Resorts|title=Mlife|url=https://www.mgmresorts.com/en/mlife-rewards-program.html}}</ref>\n\nLoyalty programs have been described as a form of centralized [[virtual currency]], one with unidirectional cash flow, since reward points can be exchanged into a [[Goods and services|good or service]] but not into cash.<ref name=ECB>{{cite book|title = Virtual Currency Schemes| date = October 2012|publisher = European Central Bank|location = Frankfurt am Main|isbn = 978-92-899-0862-7|page = 5| chapter-url = http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf|author = European Central Bank| accessdate = 5 March 2014|chapter = 1}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n:''For information on historical loyalty programs, see [[Loyalty marketing#History|Loyalty marketing history]].''\n\n==By continent and country==\n\n===Asia===\n====Mainland China====\nThe [[Social Credit System]] is a loyalty program operated by the state and private businesses.

This was an expansion of the UK scheme\u2014cards for this are identical to those used by Tesco in the UK and can be used in both countries.

Due to increasing oil prices and tightening of margins, these schemes ended by the end of 2005. Tesco Ireland's petrol stations still, however, give Clubcard points.\n\n[[Game (retailer)|Game]], a major computer game and hardware retailer also operate a cashback card scheme, which was merged with [[Electronics Boutique]]'s programme following the separation of their northern European stores into the hands of Game.

The Coop Supercard earns points on purchases at Coop and a variety of other associated stores. Other stores such as Interio, a furniture retailer, are also joining the market with loyalty cards and store-based incentivised credit cards.  The only coalition loyalty scheme in Switzerland is Bonus Card with a network of over 300 independent retail partners.<ref>[http://www.finaccord.com/uk/tables-of-contents_html/global-coalition-loyalty-programs.htm Finaccord List of Global Loyalty Programs.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122143910/http://www.finaccord.com/uk/tables-of-contents_html/global-coalition-loyalty-programs.htm |date=22 November 2018 }} Retrieved 1 March 2016</ref> In recent years, online loyalty programs have also started to target the Swiss. First to make an offering in Switzerland was German-based Webmiles.  Claiming to be Switzerland's first online bonus program, Bonuspoints was launched in early 2008 and offers incentives for shopping at 70 different online stores.\n\n====Turkey====\n[[Pegasus Airlines]] has a loyalty program called Pegasus Plus which gives rewards for every flight. Passengers can spend reward points as a discount without waiting to cover a full flight. [[Turkish Airlines]] has a loyalty program called Miles&Smiles.\n\n====United Kingdom====\nThe loyalty card market in the [[UK]] is one of the most significant in the world, with most major chains operating some form of reward system.

Some retailers with banking operations also award points for every pound spent on their credit cards, and bonus points for purchasing financial services. A report in ''[[The Economist]]'' suggested that the real benefit of loyalty cards to UK outlets is the massive [[marketing research]] database potential they offer.<ref>{{cite news|title=How Tesco is changing Britain|newspaper=The Economist|date=4 August 2005|accessdate=25 July 2007|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4247169}}</ref> Since 2015 [[Morrisons]] operates a \"More\" reward scheme which replaces the \"Morrisons Miles\" fuel purchases reward scheme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.morrisons.co.uk/Whats-New/Dont-miss-out-on-your-miles/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213040530/http://www.morrisons.co.uk/Whats-New/Dont-miss-out-on-your-miles/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-12-13|title=Morrisons Miles - Morrisons}}</ref> Unusually, customers' personal details are not collected so purchases appear not to be tracked.  Vouchers are delivered at point of sale.\n\nAfter trials in 1994, [[Tesco]] launched its [[Tesco Clubcard|Clubcard]] program, the UK's first nationwide supermarket-only loyalty card scheme, in 1995 with [[dunnhumby]].  Sainsbury's launched its Reward Card in 1996. This was replaced by the [[Nectar loyalty card|Nectar card]] in 2002, which was launched in partnership with other major brands.\n\n[[Boots UK]] began planning a loyalty card in November 1993, but building a CRM-focussed loyalty program. With an investment in excess of [[GB\u00a3]]30 million, the Boots Advantage Card, launched in 1997, is the largest smart card retail loyalty card scheme in the world, and the third-largest retail loyalty scheme in the UK in terms of cards issued.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} The Advantage scheme has 16.4 million cardholders using the card online and in store and at 3rd party retailers.  The scheme gives a cardholder four points for every pound spent in a Boots store under normal shopping circumstances.  Most stores have kiosks which can be used in conjunction with the cards for \"exclusive offers\" which are printed on vouchers and can be used at the till.  These vouchers enable money off specific purchases, extra points for specific purchases, or money off or extra points when spending has reached an amount specified on the voucher, or other offers such as double points on either everything of specific products.  For example, a customer may get a voucher which provides 250 extra points when they have spent \u00a350 in one transaction.  Points equal pence in store, and can be spent at any time and on anything in store, providing the card has enough points to cover the entire cost of the merchandise. The kiosk system was replaced with the Boots App in 2014, where customers can automatically load offers on to their Advantage Card straight from their smartphone.\n\n[[Safeway plc|Safeway's]] ABC Card was discontinued in 2000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Safeway scraps loyalty card|date=5 May 2000|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 July 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/735835.stm}}</ref> Airlines, Hotels and other loyalty schemes also offer cards. [[Marks and Spencer]] and the [[John Lewis Partnership]] have credit cards which give vouchers in return for spending, and do issue separate loyalty cards such as the myJohnLewis card, myWaitrose card in the [[John Lewis Partnership]] and the Sparks Card in by [[Marks and Spencer]]. [[Game (retailer)|Game]] has a reward card scheme for which every pound spent a customer is rewarded 10 points; for every 1000 points that one collects, one gets \u00a32.50 to redeem in the store, or online. Preorders earn a customer 20 points per pound. [[HMV]] has a reward card called purehmv which allows the customer to claim a variety of rewards, including in-store discounts.\n\nThe UK's largest retail bookmaker [[Ladbrokes]] launched the Odds ON! loyalty programme in late 2007, the first retail betting loyalty scheme in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Customers earn points on each bet which can be redeemed for bonus jokers and free bets.

This was described as \"a tiered, digital loyalty and customer engagement program that is designed to build a lifelong relationship with the customer by providing a personalized experience through which they can manage their digital and technology needs.\" However, this business ceased trading in 2012: the 11 stores were closed in January, and My Best Buy closed on 29 February.\n\n[[The Ice Organisation]] launched MyIce.com in 2010, a scheme which rewards consumers for shopping in a more sustainable way.  Ice's mission is to promote greener goods and services to mitigate [[climate change]], and works with national and local retailers to encourage more local, sustainable consumerism.\n\n[[The Co-operative Food]], the brand adopted by many of the larger members of the UK [[British co-operative movement|co-operative movement]] does not operate a traditional loyalty card scheme. Instead, as [[consumer co-operative]]s, they operate a profit sharing scheme whereby an annual [[dividend]] is paid to all member-owners which is proportional to the total spend with the businesses during the previous year. Such dividend schemes have existed since the [[Rochdale Pioneers]] of the 1840s. Paper record-keeping transformed in the 1960s into a [[trading stamp]] scheme managed by the [[Co-operative Wholesale Society]] (CWS), which was gradually withdrawn as margins declined.  The loyalty card concept was used by some co-operatives to restore dividend payments at the turn of the 21st century, notably by the CWS's \"Dividend\" card, which was replaced by [[The Co-operative Group#Dividend|The Co-operative Membership]] card program. The current members' dividend scheme is provided using the national [[The Co-operative brand|co-operative brand]] and allows members of [[The Co-operative Group]] and many of the larger regional co-operative societies to earn their 'share of the profits' based upon their spend at many of the outlets which use [[The Co-operative brand]] rather than just at their own co-operative society (e.g. [[The Co-operative Group]] or the [[Midcounties Co-operative]]).\n\nFormerly operated by [[British Airways]], [[Air Miles|Airmiles]] was the most popular flight-related loyalty program in the UK, with 2.2. million members in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Airmiles members lose free flights as loyalty scheme adds taxes of up to \u00a3600|url = http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/holidays/article-2032886/Airmiles-members-lose-free-flights-loyalty-scheme-rebrands-Avios.html|website = This is Money|accessdate = 10 December 2015}}</ref> Members could collect Airmiles each time they flew with British Airways or affiliated airlines, both within the [[International Airlines Group]] and the [[Oneworld|Oneworld Alliance]]; points could then be redeemed for flights, and was popular with both commercial and business customers.

[[PC Optimum]] is the loyalty program used by [[Loblaw Companies]]-owned entities, including [[Shopper's Drug Mart]], with the points redeemable against any purchase in $10 increments. [[More Rewards]] was founded in 1992 operates mostly in the Western Canadian provinces with close relations to its grocery partnerships with the [[Overwaitea Food Group]] and its small coalition of other retailers. [[Aeroplan]] began in 1984 as [[Air Canada]]'s frequent flier program, but has since expanded to other partners. Department store chains [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson's Bay]] and [[La Maison Simons]] both operate loyalty programs, in addition to the drug store chain [[London Drugs]]. Other notable programs include [[Scene (loyalty program)|Scene]] by the movie theatre chain [[Cineplex Entertainment]] and Plum Rewards by the bookseller [[Indigo Books and Music|Indigo]].\n\nAlmost every gas station chain in Canada offers some sort of loyalty program itself or in partnership. For example, Air Miles at [[Shell Canada|Shell]] gas stations, PC Optimum at [[Imperial Oil|Esso]] and Mobil, Petro Points + More Rewards at [[Petro-Canada]], and [[Triangle Rewards]] at Canadian Tire gas stations.\n\n====United States====\nIn the US, several major retail chains, movie theatre networks, supermarket and fish market chains, and the three major pharmacy chains<ref>{{cite web|accessdate= 2 September 2011|website=Stop and Shop|title=Stop & Shop Card Holders Can Save $10 on Seasonal Immunization|date=10 September 2009|url=http://www.stopandshop.com/about_us/news_media/press_release.htm?p=467c3411-072c-4030-86a6-aae7506d8567}}</ref> require the cards in order for customers to receive the advertised loyalty price.  They include (each through both its own name and its related regional chains) [[AMC Theatres]], [[Best Buy]], [[Circle K]], [[County Market]], [[CVS/pharmacy]], [[Giant-Carlisle]] and its sister chains [[Giant Eagle]] and [[Giant-Landover]], [[Hallmark]], [[Hy-Vee]], [[IKEA]], [[Ingles]], [[JCPenney]], [[Kohl's]], [[Kroger]], [[Menards]], [[Office Max]], [[Price Chopper Supermarkets|Price Chopper]], [[Regal Entertainment Group]], [[Rite Aid]], [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], [[Sears]] (also used by [[Kmart]]), [[ShopRite (United States)|ShopRite]], [[Stop & Shop]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Tops Markets LLC|Tops]], [[Toys \"R\" Us]] (also used by [[Babies R Us|Babies \"R\" Us]]), [[Walgreens]], [[Wegmans]], and [[Winn-Dixie]].\n\nMany retailers allow accumulation of fuel discounts.  Some have tie-ins with airline [[frequent-flyer program]]s, and some agree to donate a percentage of sales to a designated charity. Most notably, [[Walmart]] does not have a loyalty card plan, although anyone who purchases a gift card can generally get a 3-cent discount per gallon of gas at the [[Murphy USA|fuel stations located on Walmart premises]], in the 23 states with those Walmart fuel stations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe practice is common among book and music retailers, from large chains to independent retailers. In some instances, the customer purchases the card and receives a percentage discount on all purchases for a period of time (often one year), while in other instances, a customer receives a one-time percentage discount upon reaching a specified purchase level. For example, a bookseller's loyalty card program might provide a customer with a 10% off coupon once the customer has spent [[US$]]200 at the bookseller. [[Best Buy]] and [[Sears]] offer loyalty programs that offer points redeemable for dollar-amount discounts after accumulating a set number of points along with other discounts from time to time.\n\nIndependent hardware stores, such as [[Ace Hardware]] and [[True Value]], added customer loyalty programs in order to compete more effectively against larger chains as well as gather customer data. Customers with an association with a particular brand feel benefits for being part of the program. Ace's program also offers customers a way at the time of purchase to get items at a price which would normally require completing a mail-in rebate. In addition, [[office supply]] retailers [[Staples, Inc.|Staples]] and [[Office Depot]] started issuing club cards in 2005: they offer rewards in the form of credits towards future purchases on items purchased in the store or online (which items and how much credit changes periodically).\n\nAlmost all major hotel chains ([[Best Western]], [[Choice Hotels]], [[Holiday Inn]], [[Marriott International|Marriott]], [[Super 8 Worldwide|Super 8 Motels]], etc.) have cards that allow guests to earn either points (redeemable for discounts, future stays, or other prizes) and/or airline miles [[Hilton Hotels Corporation|Hilton]]'s [[Hilton HHonors|HHonors]] program allowed guests to earn both points and miles (referenced as double-dipping) on the same stay, the only program to date that did so but which ended 1 April 2018]. All major U.S. airlines also offer rewards credit cards. Other travel related reward programs include SeaMiles, with points that can be redeemed for cruises.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-28977082/ | title=Article|work=Los Angeles Times | date=14 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nSome American retailers have not implemented club cards, including grocery stores [[ALDI]], [[Publix]], and [[Whole Foods]].

In 2014, he played the teenage version of Huo Ke (portrayed by [[He Jiong]]) in [[Lock Me Up, Tie Him Down]].\n\n===2015\u20132017: ''Super Idol'' (\u661f\u52a8\u4e9a\u6d32)===\nIn 2015, Kun returned to China from America to participate in a reality show called ''Super Idol''. This idol trainee reality talent show was produced by Anhui TV, in partnership with MBC from South Korea. During the two seasons of the show, Kun experienced considerable pressure and fierce competition from the other participants and received intensive idol training in South Korea. Having surmounted all challenges throughout the one and a half years, Kun's performance skills saw an unprecedented improvement, earning him a place in the Top 3. Upon the conclusion of Season 2, Kun and a few selected trainees from the show returned to China, where they debuted as a boy group, SWIN, under the management of Yihai Entertainment Company (Yihai). As the group had already accumulated a sizable fan base at the time, the debut was highly anticipated by both the boys and their fans. However, due to the mismanagement of Yihai, the group did not have a lot performance opportunities and public appearances, which resulted in a dwindling fan base and popularity. At the beginning of 2017, Kun filed a lawsuit to terminate his contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wemedia.ifeng.com/51090331/wemedia.shtml|title=\u8521\u5f90\u5764\u548c SWIN\u7684\u5669\u68a6\uff1a3.2\u4ebf\u8fdd\u7ea6\u91d1\uff0c\u5341\u5e74\u53d1\u5c55\u8def\u832b\u832b|website=wemedia.ifeng.com|access-date=2019-03-15}}</ref>\n\n===2018: ''Idol Producer'' (\u5076\u50cf\u7ec3\u4e60\u751f) and rise in popularity===\nAfter a period of dormancy in the entertainment industry, Kun joined another reality survival show, ''[[Idol Producer]]'', as an independent trainee at the end of 2017. When the first episode of the show was broadcast, Kun's mature performance and eye-catching outfit immediately captivated viewers and the judges. This was the episode in which Kun sang \"I Wanna Get Love\", the first song that he composed and produced on his own. Despite some controversy, Kun attracted a large group of fans through his performance skills and style, stage presence and personality. He quickly rose to fame and became a hot topic for discussion on the survival show. Kun received the most votes from fans after each evaluation performance in the show. He received a total of 47,640,887 votes in the final evaluation, earning the center position in a new boy group.

As many such videos were hosted on the Chinese video website [[Bilibili]], Kun's Studio subsequently issued a legal notice to Bilibili to facilitate the possibility of legal recourse against the creators of videos, arguing that they amounted to harassment, defamation and/or an infringement of Kun's rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://passport.weibo.com/visitor/visitor?entry=miniblog&a=enter&url=https%3A%2F%2Fweibo.com%2F6423838632%2FHpin3gYAi&domain=.weibo.com&ua=php-sso_sdk_client-0.6.28&_rand=1579081159.3354|title=Sina Visitor System|website=passport.weibo.com|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref> This, however, resulted in an escalation of the controversy.

This idol trainee reality talent show was produced by Anhui TV, in partnership with MBC from South Korea. During the two seasons of the show, Kun experienced considerable pressure and fierce competition from the other participants and received intensive idol training in South Korea. Having surmounted all challenges throughout the one and a half years, Kun's performance skills saw an unprecedented improvement, earning him a place in the Top 3. Upon the conclusion of Season 2, Kun and a few selected trainees from the show returned to China, where they debuted as a boy group, SWIN, under the management of Yihai Entertainment Company (Yihai). As the group had already accumulated a sizable fan base at the time, the debut was highly anticipated by both the boys and their fans. However, due to the mismanagement of Yihai, the group did not have a lot performance opportunities and public appearances, which resulted in a dwindling fan base and popularity. At the beginning of 2017, Kun filed a lawsuit to terminate his contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wemedia.ifeng.com/51090331/wemedia.shtml|title=\u8521\u5f90\u5764\u548c SWIN\u7684\u5669\u68a6\uff1a3.2\u4ebf\u8fdd\u7ea6\u91d1\uff0c\u5341\u5e74\u53d1\u5c55\u8def\u832b\u832b|website=wemedia.ifeng.com|access-date=2019-03-15}}</ref>\n\n===2018: ''Idol Producer'' (\u5076\u50cf\u7ec3\u4e60\u751f) and rise in popularity===\nAfter a period of dormancy in the entertainment industry, Kun joined another reality survival show, ''[[Idol Producer]]'', as an independent trainee at the end of 2017.

He received a total of 47,640,887 votes in the final evaluation, earning the center position in a new boy group. On April 6, 2018, Kun officially debuted as the leader and center of the said boy group, [[Nine Percent]].\n\nSoon after the conclusion of ''Idol Producer'', ''[[I Won't Get Bullied by Girls]]'', a web-drama starring Kun was released.

Yihai was allegedly in arrears and members of SWIN were said to have to pay for all expenses of their activities, including but not limited to their albums and fan meetings, without being reimbursed. Furthermore, Yihai demanded that each member sign a Debt Acknowledgment Letter for 1.1 million RMB (approximately US$165,000) to share the production costs for Season 2 of ''Super Idol''.
