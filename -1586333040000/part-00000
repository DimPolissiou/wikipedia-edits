This is in contrast to delivery through traditional [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]], [[Satellite television|satellite]], and [[Cable television|cable]] television formats. Unlike [[download]]ed media, IPTV offers the ability to stream the source media continuously. As a result, a client media player can begin playing the content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately. This is known as [[streaming media]].\n\nAlthough IPTV uses the Internet protocol it is not limited to [[streaming television|television streamed]] from the [[Internet]] ([[Internet television]]). IPTV is widely deployed in subscriber-based telecommunications networks with high-speed access channels into end-user premises via [[set-top box]]es or other [[customer-premises equipment]]. IPTV is also used for media delivery around corporate and private networks. IPTV in the telecommunications arena is notable for its ongoing standardisation process (e.g., [[ETSI|European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]).\n\nIPTV services may be classified into [[live television]] and live media, with or without related interactivity; [[time shifting]] of media, e.g., [[catch-up TV]] (replays a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago), start-over TV (replays the current TV show from its beginning); and [[video on demand]] (VOD) which involves browsing and viewing items of a media catalogue.\n\n==Definition==\nHistorically, many different definitions of IPTV have appeared, including elementary streams{{clarify|date=February 2018}} over IP networks, [[MPEG transport stream]]s over IP networks and a number of proprietary systems. One official definition approved by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] focus group on IPTV (ITU-T FG IPTV) is:\n\n<blockquote>IPTV is defined as multimedia services such as television/video/audio/text/graphics/data delivered over IP based networks managed to provide the required level of quality of service and experience, security, interactivity and reliability.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/IPTV+Standardization+On+Track+Say+Industry+Experts.aspx |work=ITU-T Newslog |date=27 October 2006 |title=IPTV Standardization on Track Say Industry Experts |access-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916031736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/IPTV+Standardization+On+Track+Say+Industry+Experts.aspx |archive-date=16 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother definition of IPTV, relating to the telecommunications industry, is the one given by [[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions]] (ATIS) IPTV Exploratory Group in 2005:\n\n<blockquote>IPTV is defined as the secure and reliable delivery to subscribers of entertainment video and related services.  These services may include, for example, Live TV, Video On Demand (VOD) and [[Interactive television|Interactive TV (iTV)]]. These services are delivered across an access agnostic, packet switched network that employs the IP protocol to transport the audio, video and control signals. In contrast to video over the public Internet, with IPTV deployments, network security and performance are tightly managed to ensure a superior entertainment experience, resulting in a compelling business environment for content providers, advertisers and customers alike.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.atis.org/tops/IEG/ATIS_IPTV_EG_RPT_final.pdf |access-date=17 January 2012 |title=ATIS IPTV Exploratory Group Report and Recommendation to the TOPS Council |date=July 2006 |publisher=Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118031705/http://www.atis.org/tops/IEG/ATIS_IPTV_EG_RPT_final.pdf |archive-date=18 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nUp until the early 1990s, it was not thought possible that a [[television show|television programme]] could be squeezed into the limited [[telecommunication]] [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a [[copper]] [[telephone cable]] to provide a [[video-on-demand]] (VOD) television service of acceptable quality, as the required bandwidth of a [[digital television]] signal was around 200{{nbsp}}[[Mbps]], which was 2,000 times greater than the bandwidth of a speech signal over a copper [[telephone wire]]. VOD services were only made possible as a result of two major technological developments: [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) [[video compression]] and [[asymmetric digital subscriber line]] (ADSL) [[data transmission]].<ref name=\"Lea\">{{cite book |last1=Lea |first1=William |title=Video on demand: Research Paper 94/68 |date=1994 |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |location=9 May 1994 |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP94-68 |accessdate=20 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920082623/https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP94-68 |archive-date=20 September 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> DCT is a [[lossy compression]] technique that was first proposed by [[N.

Examples of types of commercial users include airports, schools, offices, hotels, and sports stadiums, to name just a few.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:IPTVnet.png|thumbnail|A simplified network diagram for IPTV]]\n\n===Elements===\n* IPTV head-end: where live TV channels and AV sources are encoded, encrypted and delivered in the form of [[IP multicast]] streams.\n* Video on Demand (VOD) platform: where on-demand video assets are stored and served as IP unicast streams when a user makes a request. The VOD platform may sometimes be located with, and considered part of, the IPTV headend.\n* Interactive portal: allows the user to navigate within the different IPTV services, such as the VOD catalogue.\n* Delivery network: the packet switched network that carries IP packets (unicast and multicast).\n* Endpoints: User equipment that can request, decode and deliver IPTV streams for display to the user. This can include computers and mobile devices as well as [[set-top box]]es.\n* Home [[TV gateway]]: the piece of equipment at a residential IPTV user's home that terminates the access link from the delivery network.\n* User [[set-top box]]: the piece of endpoint equipment that decodes and decrypts TV and VOD streams for display on the TV screen.\n\n===Architecture of a video server network===\nDepending on the network architecture of the service provider, there are two main types of video server architecture that can be considered for IPTV deployment: centralised and distributed.\n\nThe centralised architecture model is a relatively simple and easy to manage solution. Because all media content is stored in centralised servers, it does not require a comprehensive content distribution system. Centralised architecture is generally good for a network that provides relatively small VOD service deployment, has adequate core and edge bandwidth and has an efficient [[content delivery network]] (CDN).\n\nDistributed architecture is just as scalable as the centralised model, however it has bandwidth usage advantages and inherent system management features that are essential for managing a larger server network. Operators who plan to deploy a relatively large system should therefore consider implementing a distributed architecture model right from the start. Distributed architecture requires intelligent and sophisticated content distribution technologies to augment effective delivery of multimedia contents over service provider's network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inwf.com/pubs/print/aroc58_toc.html|title=inwf.com|author=|date=|website=www.inwf.com|access-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222175000/http://www.inwf.com/pubs/print/aroc58_toc.html|archive-date=22 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Residential IPTV home networks===\nIn many cases, the [[residential gateway]] that provides connectivity with the [[Internet access]] network is not located close to the IPTV set-top box.

Playback requires a broadband device connected to either a fixed or wireless IP network in the form of either a standalone [[personal computer]] or limited embedded [[Operating system|OS]] device such as a [[smartphone]], [[Internet tablet|touch screen tablet]], [[game console]], [[connected TV]] or [[Set-top box#IPTV receiver|set-top box]].  Video compression is provided by either a [[H.263]] or [[H.264]] derived codec, audio is compressed via a [[MDCT]] based codec and then encapsulated in either an [[MPEG transport stream]] or [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]] packets or [[Flash Video]] packets for live or VoD streaming.  IP multicasting allows for live data to be sent to multiple receivers using a single multicast group address. [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]]/MPEG-4 AVC is commonly used for internet streaming over higher bit rate standards such as [[H.261]] and [[H.263]] which were more designed for [[ISDN]] video conferencing. [[H.262]]/MPEG-1/2 is generally not used as the bandwidth required would quite easily saturate a network which is why they are only used in single link broadcast or storage applications.\n\nIn standards-based IPTV systems, the primary underlying protocols used are:\n* Service provider-based streaming:\n** [[IGMP]] for subscribing to a live multicast stream (TV channel) and for changing from one live multicast stream to another (TV channel change). IP multicast operates within LANs (including VLANs) and across WANs also. IP multicast is usually routed in the network core by [[Protocol Independent Multicast]] (PIM), setting up correct distribution of multicast streams (TV channels) from their source all the way to the customers who wants to view them, duplicating received packets as needed.  On-demand content uses a negotiated unicast connection. [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) over [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) or the lower overhead [[H.222]] transport stream over [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) are generally the preferred methods of encapsulation.\n* [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based [[unicast]] only live and VoD streaming:\n** [[Adobe Flash Player]] prefers [[Real Time Messaging Protocol|RTMP]] over TCP with setup and control via either [[Action Message Format|AMF]] or [[XML]] or [[JSON]] transactions.\n** Apple iOS uses [[HTTP Live Streaming|HLS]] [[adaptive bitrate streaming]] over [[HTTP]] with setup and control via an embedded [[M3U]] playlist file.\n** Microsoft Silverlight uses [[Smooth Streaming|smooth streaming]] ([[adaptive bitrate streaming]]) over HTTP.\n* Web-based multicast live and unicast VoD streaming:\n** The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) recommends RTP over UDP or [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] transports with setup and control using [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]] over TCP.\n* [[Connected TV]]s, [[game console]]s, [[Set-top box#IPTV receiver|set-top boxes]] and [[network personal video recorder]]s:\n** local network content uses [[Universal Plug and Play#UPnP AV standards|UPnP AV]] for [[unicast]] via HTTP over TCP or for multicast live RTP over UDP.\n** Web-based content is provided through either inline Web plug-ins or a television broadcast-based application that uses a [[middleware]] language such as [[MHEG-5]] that triggers an event such as loading an inline Web browser using an [[Adobe Flash Player]] plug-in.\n\nA telecommunications company IPTV service is usually delivered over an investment-heavy [[Walled garden (technology)|walled garden network]].\n\nLocal IPTV, as used by businesses for [[audio visual]] AV distribution on their company networks is typically based on a mixture of:\n# Conventional TV reception equipment and IPTV encoders\n# IP[[TV gateway]]s that take broadcast MPEG channels and IP wrap them to create multicast streams.\n\n==Via satellite==\nAlthough IPTV and conventional [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] distribution have been seen as complementary technologies, they are likely to be increasingly used together in hybrid IPTV networks that deliver the highest levels of performance and reliability. IPTV is largely neutral to the transmission medium, and IP traffic is already routinely carried by satellite for [[Internet backbone]] trunking and corporate [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] networks.<ref>Berlocher, Greg and Freyer, Dan. \"IP And Satellite: Communications Worlds Merging\" ''Via Satellite'' January 2009 p 24\u201328</ref> The use of satellite to carry IP is fundamental to overcoming the greatest shortcoming of IPTV over terrestrial cables \u2013 the speed/bandwidth of the connection, as well as availability.\n\nThe copper twisted pair cabling that forms the [[last mile]] of the telephone and broadband network in many countries is not able to provide a sizeable proportion of the population with an IPTV service that matches even existing terrestrial or satellite digital TV distribution. For a competitive multi-channel TV service, a connection speed of 20&nbsp;Mbit/s is likely to be required, but unavailable to most potential customers.<ref>Taga, Karim. \"Hybrid delivery of content for IPTV\" ''InterComms'' Issue 11 August 2008 p 13\u201314</ref> The increasing popularity of [[high-definition television]] (with twice the data rate of [[Standard-definition television|SD video]]) increases connection speed requirements, or limits IPTV service quality and connection eligibility even further.\n\nHowever, satellites are capable of delivering in excess of 100&nbsp;Gbit/s via multi-spot beam technologies, making satellite a clear emerging technology for implementing IPTV networks. Satellite distribution can be included in an IPTV network architecture in several ways. The simplest to implement is an IPTV-[[Direct-broadcast satellite|direct to home]] (DTH) architecture, in which hybrid DVB-broadband [[set-top box]]es in subscriber homes integrate satellite and IP reception to give near-infinite bandwidth with return channel capabilities. In such a system, many live TV channels may be multicast via satellite (IP-encapsulated or as conventional [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] digital TV) with stored video-on-demand transmission via the broadband connection. [[Arqiva]]\u2019s Satellite Media Solutions Division suggests \"IPTV works best in a hybrid format. For example, you would use broadband to receive some content and satellite to receive other, such as live channels\".<ref>Holmes, Mark. \"Broadcast 2.0: The Changing Scene In Europe\" ''Via Satellite'' September 2008 p 20\u201325</ref>\n\n==Hybrid IPTV==\n{{Update|section|inaccurate=yes|date=July 2011}}\n\nHybrid IPTV refers to the combination of traditional broadcast TV services and video delivered over either managed IP networks or the public Internet.

Since the emergence of online video aggregation sites, like [[YouTube]] and [[Vimeo]] in the mid-2000s, traditional [[pay TV]] operators have come under increasing pressure to provide their subscribers with a means of viewing [[Internet]]-based video [both professional and user-generated] on their televisions. At the same time, specialist [[Internet Protocol|IP]]-based operators [often telecommunications providers] have looked for ways to offer [[Analog television|analogue]] and [[digital terrestrial]] services to their operations, without adding either additional cost or complexity to their transmission operations. [[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]] is a valuable asset for operators, so many have looked for alternative ways to deliver these new services without investing in additional network infrastructures.\n\nA hybrid set-top allows content from a range of sources, including [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] broadcast, satellite, and cable, to be brought together with video delivered over the Internet via an Ethernet connection on the device. This enables television viewers to access a greater variety of content on their TV sets, without the need for a separate box for each service.\n\nHybrid IPTV set-top boxes also enable users to access a range of advanced interactive services, such as [[Video on demand|VOD]] / catch-up TV, as well as Internet applications, including [[Videotelephony|video telephony]], surveillance, gaming, shopping, [[E-Government|e-government]] accessed via a [[television set]].\n\nFrom a [[pay-TV]] operator's perspective, a hybrid IPTV set-top box gives them greater long-term flexibility by enabling them to deploy new services and applications as and when consumers require, most often without the need to upgrade equipment or for a technician to visit and reconfigure or swap out the device. This reduces the cost of launching new services, increases speed to market and limits disruption for consumers.<ref>[http://www.v-net.tv/Webcast.aspx?id=5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405064453/http://www.v-net.tv/Webcast.aspx?id=5 |date=5 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] (HbbTV) consortium of industry companies is currently{{When|date=January 2012}} promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast and broadband digital TV and multimedia applications with a single user interface.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=HbbTV Consortium |date=27 August 2009 |url=http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |title=New European initiative merges television with the power of the Internet |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007125549/http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |archive-date=7 October 2009 }}</ref> These trends led to the development of [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] set-top boxes that included both a [[ATSC tuner|broadcast tuner]] and an [[Internet access|Internet connection]]&nbsp;\u2013 usually an [[Ethernet]] port. The first commercially available hybrid IPTV set-top box was developed by [[Advanced Digital Broadcast]], a developer of digital television hardware and software, in 2005. The platform was developed for Spanish pay TV operator [[Telefonica]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltvnews.net/items/060911adb_spain.htm |title=ADB Delivers World's First Hybrid, Single-Chip, Advanced Video Coding, High Definition IPTV Set-Top Boxes To TELEF\u00d3NICA |publisher=Digitaltvnews.net |date= |access-date=15 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227141252/http://www.digitaltvnews.net/items/060911adb_spain.htm |archive-date=27 February 2012 }}</ref> and used as part of its Movistar TV service, launched to subscribers at the end of 2005.\n\nAn alternative approach is the IPTV version of the [[Headend in the Sky]] cable TV solution. Here, multiple TV channels are distributed via satellite to the ISP or IPTV provider's [[point of presence]] (POP) for IP-encapsulated distribution to individual subscribers as required by each subscriber.\n\nThis can provide a huge selection of channels to subscribers without overburdening Internet trunking to the POP, and enables an IPTV service to be offered to small or remote operators outside the reach of terrestrial high speed broadband connection. An example is a network combining fibre and satellite distribution via an [[SES New Skies]] satellite of 95 channels to Latin America and the Caribbean, operated by IPTV Americas.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=IPTV Americas |date=13 January 2009 |url=http://www.iptv-americas.tv/releaseDB.php?leng=&notID=47 |title=IPTV Americas Launches First IPTV Satellite Distribution Platform for Latin America and The Caribbean via SES NEW SKIES' NSS-806 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016015125/http://www.iptv-americas.tv/releaseDB.php?leng=&notID=47 |archive-date=16 October 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nWhile the future development of IPTV probably lies with a number of coexisting architectures and implementations, it is clear{{According to whom|date=January 2012}} that broadcasting of high bandwidth applications such as IPTV is accomplished more efficiently and cost-effectively using satellite<ref>International Datacasting Corporation [http://www.datacast.com/pg_SolutionIndex.php \"Why IP Over Satellite?\"].

Retrieved 18 January 2009.</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nThe Internet protocol-based platform offers significant advantages, including the ability to integrate television with other IP-based services like high speed Internet access and VoIP.\n\nA switched IP network also allows for the delivery of significantly more content and functionality. In a typical TV or satellite network, using broadcast video technology, all the content constantly flows downstream to each customer, and the customer switches the content at the set-top box. The customer can select from as many choices as the telecomms, cable or satellite company can stuff into the \"pipe\" flowing into the home. A switched IP network works differently. Content remains in the network, and only the content the customer selects is sent into the customer's home. That frees up bandwidth, and the customer's choice is less restricted by the size of the \"pipe\" into the home. This also implies that the customer's privacy could be compromised to a greater extent than is possible with traditional TV or satellite networks. It may also provide a means to hack into, or at least disrupt (see [[Denial-of-service attack|Denial of service]]) the private network.\n\n===Economics===\nThe cable industry's expenditures of approximately $1 billion per year are based on network updates to accommodate higher data speeds. Most operators use 2\u20133 channels to support maximum data speeds of 50&nbsp;Mbit/s to 100&nbsp;Mbit/s. However, because video streams require a high bit rate for much longer periods of time, the expenditures to support high amounts of video traffic will be much greater. This phenomenon is called persistency. Data persistency is routinely 5% while video persistency can easily reach 50%. As video traffic continues to grow, this means that significantly more [[Cable modem termination system|CMTS]] downstream channels will be required to carry this video content. Based on today's market, it is likely that industry expenditures for CMTS expansion could exceed $2 billion a year, virtually all of that expenditure being driven by video traffic. Adoption of IPTV for carrying the majority of this traffic could save the industry approximately 75% of this capital expenditure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.curvedview.com/economics-iptv/|title=The Economics of IPTV|date=2 February 2015|language=en-US|access-date=23 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920030343/http://www.curvedview.com/economics-iptv/|archive-date=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Interactivity===\nAn IP-based platform also allows significant opportunities to make the TV viewing experience more interactive and personalised.\nThe supplier may, for example, include an interactive programme guide that allows viewers to search for content by title or actor's name, or a [[picture-in-picture]] functionality that allows them to \"channel surf\" without leaving the programme they're watching. Viewers may be able to look up a player's stats while watching a sports game, or control the camera angle. They also may be able to access photos or music from their PC on their television, use a wireless phone to schedule a recording of their favourite show, or even adjust parental controls so their child can watch a documentary for a school report, while they're away from home.\n\nIn order that there can take place an interaction between the receiver and the transmitter, a feedback channel is needed. Due to this, terrestrial, satellite, and cable networks for television do not allow interactivity. However, interactivity with those networks can be possible by combining TV networks with data networks such as the [[Internet]] or a mobile communication network.\n\n===Video-on-demand===\nIPTV technology is bringing [[video on demand]] (VoD) to television,<ref>[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ Broadband Users Control What They Watch and When] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420143608/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ |date=20 April 2010 }}</ref> which permits a customer to browse an online programme or film catalogue, to watch trailers and to then select a selected recording. The [[playout]] of the selected item starts nearly instantaneously on the customer's TV or PC.\n\nTechnically, when the customer selects the movie, a [[Point-to-Point Protocol|point-to-point]] unicast connection is set up between the customer's decoder (set-top box or PC) and the delivering streaming server. The signalling for the trick play functionality (pause, slow-motion, wind/rewind etc.) is assured by RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol).\n\nThe most common codecs used for VoD are [[MPEG-2]], [[MPEG-4]] and [[VC-1]].\n\nIn an attempt to avoid content piracy, the VoD content is usually encrypted. Whilst [[encryption]] of satellite and cable TV broadcasts is an old practice, with IPTV technology it can effectively be thought of as a form of [[Digital rights management]]. A film that is chosen, for example, may be playable for 24 hours following payment, after which time it becomes unavailable.\n\n===IPTV-based converged services===\nAnother advantage is the opportunity for integration and convergence. This opportunity is amplified when using IMS-based solutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Session and Media Signalling for IPTV via IMS|url=http://c-mobile.ptinovacao.pt/files/PaperMobilWare2008.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625075612/http://c-mobile.ptinovacao.pt/files/PaperMobilWare2008.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 June 2008|website=MobileWare'08|authors=Riede, Christian & Al-Hezmi, Adel & Magedanz, Thomas||location= Innsbruck, Austria||isbn=|date=12 February 2008 }}</ref> Converged services implies interaction of existing services in a seamless manner to create new value added services. One example is on-screen [[Caller ID]], getting Caller ID on a TV, and the ability to handle it (send it to voice mail, etc.). IP-based services help to enable efforts to provide consumers anytime-anywhere access to content over their televisions, PCs, and mobile device, and to integrate services and content to tie them together. Within businesses and institutions, IPTV eliminates the need to run a parallel infrastructure to deliver live and stored video services.\n\n==Limitations==\nIPTV is sensitive to packet loss and delays if the streamed data is unreliable. IPTV has strict minimum speed requirements in order to facilitate the right number of frames per second to deliver moving pictures. This means that the limited connection speed and bandwidth available for a large IPTV customer base can reduce the service quality delivered.\n\nAlthough a few countries have very high-speed broadband-enabled populations, such as [[South Korea]] with 6 million homes benefiting from a minimum connection speed of 100&nbsp;Mbit/s, in other countries (such as the UK) legacy networks struggle to provide 3\u20135&nbsp;Mbit/s<ref>Bulkley, Kate. \"IPTV\u2019s Eastern Promise\" ''Digital TV Europe'' October 2008 p 48</ref>{{Update after|2013|8|13}} and so simultaneous provision to the home of TV channels, VOIP and Internet access may not be viable. The last-mile delivery for IPTV usually has a bandwidth restriction that only allows a small number of simultaneous TV channel streams&nbsp;\u2013 typically from one to three&nbsp;\u2013 to be delivered.<ref>Brown, Peter J. \"Super Headends And High Expectations\" ''Via Satellite'' April 2006 p 18\u201330</ref>\n\nStreaming IPTV across wireless links within the home has proved troublesome; not due to bandwidth limitations as many{{Who|date=January 2012}} assume, but due to issues with multipath and reflections of the RF signal carrying the IP data packets. An IPTV stream is sensitive to packets arriving at the right time and in the right order. Improvements in wireless technology are now{{When|date=January 2012}} starting to provide equipment to solve the problem.<ref>Market Wire [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091001092108/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200806/ai_n26682515 \"ZyXEL Announces Industry's First ADSL2/2+ 802.11n Gateway and New IPTV Product Offerings\"] June 2008</ref>\n\nDue to the limitations of wireless, most IPTV service providers today use wired home networking technologies instead of wireless technologies like [[IEEE 802.11]]. Service providers such as AT&T (which makes extensive use of wireline home networking as part of its [[AT&T U-verse]] IPTV service) have expressed support for the work done in this direction by [[ITU-T]], which has adopted Recommendation [[G.hn]] (also known as G.9960), which is a next-generation home networking standard that specifies a common PHY/MAC that can operate over any home wiring (power lines, phone lines or coaxial cables).<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/homepna-homegrid-sign-liaison-agreement/story.aspx?guid={C8E4BB07-375A-41E5-8B05-2E33222E44C2}&dist=msr_9 HomePNA and HomeGrid Sign Liaison Agreement]{{dead link|date=February 2016}}, Groups Work to Promote New ITU G.hn Global Wired Home Networking Standard</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everywire.com/2009/02/att-participating-in-ghn-standard-development-1.html|title=AT&T Participating in G.hn Standard Development|author=|date=|website=everywire.com|access-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810051112/http://www.everywire.com/2009/02/att-participating-in-ghn-standard-development-1.html|archive-date=10 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Latency===\nThe [[latency (engineering)|latency]] inherent in the use of [[Satellite Internet access|satellite Internet]] is often held up as reason why satellites cannot be successfully used for IPTV. In practice, however, latency is not an important factor for IPTV, since it is a service that does not require real-time transmission, as is the case with telephony or videoconferencing services.\n\nIt is the latency of response to requests to change channel, display an EPG, etc. that most affects customers\u2019 perceived quality of service, and these problems affect satellite IPTV no more than terrestrial IPTV. Command latency problems, faced by terrestrial IPTV networks with insufficient bandwidth as their customer base grows, may be solved by the high capacity of satellite distribution.\n\nSatellite distribution does suffer from latency&nbsp;\u2013 the time for the signal to travel up from the hub to the satellite and back down to the user is around 0.25 seconds, and cannot be reduced. However, the effects of this delay are mitigated in real-life systems using data compression, TCP-acceleration, and HTTP pre-fetching.<ref>Newtec Productions NV [http://www.newtec.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/product_leaflets/sat3Play/Sat3Play_Ku-band_Terminal_TP210_R1.pdf \"TP210 Sat3Play Broadband Terminal\"] (Version R2/06.2010).

Existing [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] TV channels that [[simulcast]] by both terrestrial and satellite transmissions experience the same 0.25-second delay difference between the two services with no detrimental effect, and it goes unnoticed by viewers.\n\n==Bandwidth requirements==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Figure2a.jpg|thumb|400px|Bandwidth capacity for simultaneously two HDTV streams, two SD streams, additional to HSD and voice]]\n\nDigital video is a combination of sequence of digital images, and they are made up of [[pixel]]s or picture elements. Each pixel has two values, which are [[luminance]] and [[chrominance]]. Luminance is representing intensity of the pixel; chrominance represents the colour of the pixel. Three bytes would be used to represent the colour of the high quality image for a true colour technique. A sequence of images is creating the digital video, in that case, images are called as frames.\n\nMovies use 24 frames per second; however, the rate of the frames can change according to territories' electrical systems so that there are different kinds of frame rates, for instance, North America is using approximately 30 frames per second where the Europe television frame rate is 25 frames per second. Each digital video has dimensions width and height; when referred to analogue television, the dimension for SDTV is 720\u00d7480 pixels, on the other hand, numerous HDTV requires 1920\u00d71080 pixels. Moreover, whilst for SDTV, two bytes (16 bits) is enough to create the colour depth, HDTV requires three bytes (24 bits) to create the colour depth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThereby, with a rate of 30 frames/second, the uncompressed data rate for SDTV becomes 30\u00d7720\u00d7480\u00d716,{{vague|date=July 2017}} in other words, 147,456,000 bits per second. Moreover, for HDTV, at the same frame rate, uncompressed date rate becomes 30\u00d71920\u00d71080\u00d724 or 1,492,992,000 bits per second. Using that simple calculation, a service provider's service delivery to the subscribers is limited unless a lossy compression method is used.\n\nThere is no absolute answer for the bandwidth requirement for the IPTV service because the bandwidth requirement is increasing due to the devices inside the household. Thus, currently compressed HDTV content can be delivered at a data rate between 8 and 10&nbsp;Mbit/s, but if the home of the consumer equipped with several HDTV outputs, this rate will be multiplied respectively.\n\nThe high-speed data transfer will increase the needed bandwidth for the viewer, at least 2&nbsp;Mbit/s is needed to use web-based applications on the computer. Additionally to that, 64&nbsp;kbit/s is required to use landline telephone for the property. In minimal usage, to receive an IPTV triple-play service requires 13&nbsp;Mbit/s to process in a household.\n\n==Privacy implications==\nDue to limitations in bandwidth, an IPTV channel is delivered to the user one at a time, as opposed to the traditional multiplexed delivery. Changing a channel requires requesting the head-end server to provide a different broadcast stream, much like [[Video on demand|VOD]] (For VOD the stream is delivered using [[unicast]], for the normal TV signal multicast is used). This could enable the service provider to accurately track each and every programme watched and the duration of watching for each viewer; broadcasters and advertisers could then understand their audience and programming better with accurate data and [[targeted advertising]].\n\nIn conjunction with regulatory differences between IPTV and cable TV, this tracking could pose a threat to privacy according to critics.<ref>[http://www.cedmagazine.com/iptv-privacy-risks.aspx IPTV privacy risks<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105172921/http://www.cedmagazine.com/iptv-privacy-risks.aspx |date=5 January 2010 }}</ref>  For IP multicast scenarios, since a particular multicast group (TV channel) needs to be requested before it can be viewed, the same privacy concerns apply.\n\n==Vendors==\nGlobal sales of IPTV systems exceeded US$2 billion in 2007, although only a small number of companies supply most current IPTV system solutions. Some, such as [[Movistar TV]], were formed by telecoms operators themselves, to minimise external costs, a tactic also used by [[PCCW]] of [[Hong Kong]]. Some major telecoms vendors are also active in this space, notably [[Accenture]] (Accenture Video Solution), [[Alcatel-Lucent]] (sometimes working with Movistar TV), [[Ericsson]] (notably since acquiring [[Tandberg Television]]), [[Huawei]], [[NEC]], [[PTCL Smart TV]], [[Sri Lanka Telecom]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson]], and [[ZTE]], as are some IT houses, led by [[Microsoft]]. Delaware-based AlphaOTT Tokyo-based The New Media Group, Malaysian-based [[Select-TV]], Oslo/Norway-based SnapTV, and California-based [[UTStarcom]], Inc. also offer end-to-end networking infrastructure for IPTV-based services, and Hong Kong-based BNS Ltd. provides turnkey open platform IPTV technology solutions. \n\nChannel PEAR is a \"collaborative, cloud-based media platform\"<ref>{{cite web|website=Channel PEAR |title=Login|url=https://channelpear.com/login/}}</ref> that allows users to create a private channel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thestreamingadvisor.com/add-channel-pear-back-to-roku/|website=The Streaming Advisor|title= HOW TO PLEX: What Happened To Channel Pear On Roku How to Get It Back| author=Downey, Ryan|date=October 25, 2017}}</ref> on which they can discover, share, and view video files, MRSS feeds, and live IPTV streams from around the world, through devices such as [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]],<ref>{{cite web|website=Addictive Tips|url=https://www.addictivetips.com/media-streaming/channel-pear-kodi-addon/|title=Channel Pear Kodi Add-on, Installation Tutorial and Discovery| author=Larue-Langlois, Renaud Larue-Langlois|date= September 16, 2017}}</ref> [[Plex (software)|Plex]],<ref>{{cite web|website=Plex TV Forums|url=https://forums.plex.tv/t/rel-channel-pear-live-stream-discovery-iptv/113612|title=Channel Pear Live Stream Discovery}}</ref> and [[Roku]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Roku Guide|url=https://www.rokuguide.com/private-channels/channel-pear|title=Private Channels: Channel PEAR}}</ref>\n\nHospitality IPTV Ltd, having established many closed network IPTV systems, expanded in 2013 to OTT delivery platforms for markets in New Zealand, Australia, and Asia Pacific region.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[Google Fiber]] offers an IPTV service in various US cities which includes up to 1 Gigabit-speed internet and over 290 channels depending on package via the fiber optic network being built out in Kansas City Kansas and Kansas City Missouri.\n\nPEAR IPTV self-declares as \"the leading IPTV provider in the world\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://peariptv.com/|website= PEAR IPTV|title =Home Page}}</ref>\n\nMany of these IPTV solution vendors participated in the biennial Multiservice Switching Forum Interoperability 2008 (GMI) event which was coordinated by the [[MultiService Forum]] (MSF) at five sites worldwide from 20 to 31 October 2008. Test equipment vendors including Netrounds, [[Codenomicon]], [[Empirix]], Ixia, [[Mu Dynamics]] and [[Spirent]] joined solution vendors such as the companies listed above in one of the largest IPTV proving grounds ever deployed.\n\n==Service bundling==\nFor residential users, IPTV is often provided in conjunction with [[video on demand]] and may be bundled with [[Internet service]]s such as [[Internet access]] and [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) telecommunications services. Commercial bundling of IPTV, VoIP and Internet access is sometimes referred to in marketing as ''[[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]]'' service.  When these three are offered with cellular service, the combined service may be referred to as ''[[quadruple play]]''.\n\n==Regulation==\nHistorically, broadcast television has been regulated differently from telecommunications. As IPTV allows TV and VoD to be transmitted over IP networks, new regulatory issues arise.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/publications/ericsson_business_review/pdf/308/308_38_41_reshaping.pdf |title= Ericsson report on need for regulation |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081115174848/http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/publications/ericsson_business_review/pdf/308/308_38_41_reshaping.pdf |archive-date= 15 November 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(217&nbsp;KB)}}</ref>\nProfessor Eli M.

This is in contrast to delivery through traditional [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]], [[Satellite television|satellite]], and [[Cable television|cable]] television formats. Unlike [[download]]ed media, IPTV offers the ability to stream the source media continuously. As a result, a client media player can begin playing the content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately. This is known as [[streaming media]].\n\nAlthough IPTV uses the Internet protocol it is not limited to [[streaming television|television streamed]] from the [[Internet]] ([[Internet television]]). IPTV is widely deployed in subscriber-based telecommunications networks with high-speed access channels into end-user premises via [[set-top box]]es or other [[customer-premises equipment]]. IPTV is also used for media delivery around corporate and private networks. IPTV in the telecommunications arena is notable for its ongoing standardisation process (e.g., [[ETSI|European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]).\n\nIPTV services may be classified into [[live television]] and live media, with or without related interactivity; [[time shifting]] of media, e.g., [[catch-up TV]] (replays a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago), start-over TV (replays the current TV show from its beginning); and [[video on demand]] (VOD) which involves browsing and viewing items of a media catalogue.\n\n==Definition==\nHistorically, many different definitions of IPTV have appeared, including elementary streams{{clarify|date=February 2018}} over IP networks, [[MPEG transport stream]]s over IP networks and a number of proprietary systems. One official definition approved by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] focus group on IPTV (ITU-T FG IPTV) is:\n\n<blockquote>IPTV is defined as multimedia services such as television/video/audio/text/graphics/data delivered over IP based networks managed to provide the required level of quality of service and experience, security, interactivity and reliability.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/IPTV+Standardization+On+Track+Say+Industry+Experts.aspx |work=ITU-T Newslog |date=27 October 2006 |title=IPTV Standardization on Track Say Industry Experts |access-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916031736/http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/IPTV+Standardization+On+Track+Say+Industry+Experts.aspx |archive-date=16 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother definition of IPTV, relating to the telecommunications industry, is the one given by [[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions]] (ATIS) IPTV Exploratory Group in 2005:\n\n<blockquote>IPTV is defined as the secure and reliable delivery to subscribers of entertainment video and related services.  These services may include, for example, Live TV, Video On Demand (VOD) and [[Interactive television|Interactive TV (iTV)]]. These services are delivered across an access agnostic, packet switched network that employs the IP protocol to transport the audio, video and control signals. In contrast to video over the public Internet, with IPTV deployments, network security and performance are tightly managed to ensure a superior entertainment experience, resulting in a compelling business environment for content providers, advertisers and customers alike.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.atis.org/tops/IEG/ATIS_IPTV_EG_RPT_final.pdf |access-date=17 January 2012 |title=ATIS IPTV Exploratory Group Report and Recommendation to the TOPS Council |date=July 2006 |publisher=Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118031705/http://www.atis.org/tops/IEG/ATIS_IPTV_EG_RPT_final.pdf |archive-date=18 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nUp until the early 1990s, it was not thought possible that a [[television show|television programme]] could be squeezed into the limited [[telecommunication]] [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a [[copper]] [[telephone cable]] to provide a [[video-on-demand]] (VOD) television service of acceptable quality, as the required bandwidth of a [[digital television]] signal was around 200{{nbsp}}[[Mbps]], which was 2,000 times greater than the bandwidth of a speech signal over a copper [[telephone wire]].

Examples of types of commercial users include airports, schools, offices, hotels, and sports stadiums, to name just a few.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:IPTVnet.png|thumbnail|A simplified network diagram for IPTV]]\n\n===Elements===\n* IPTV head-end: where live TV channels and AV sources are encoded, encrypted and delivered in the form of [[IP multicast]] streams.\n* Video on Demand (VOD) platform: where on-demand video assets are stored and served as IP unicast streams when a user makes a request. The VOD platform may sometimes be located with, and considered part of, the IPTV headend.\n* Interactive portal: allows the user to navigate within the different IPTV services, such as the VOD catalogue.\n* Delivery network: the packet switched network that carries IP packets (unicast and multicast).\n* Endpoints: User equipment that can request, decode and deliver IPTV streams for display to the user. This can include computers and mobile devices as well as [[set-top box]]es.\n* Home [[TV gateway]]: the piece of equipment at a residential IPTV user's home that terminates the access link from the delivery network.\n* User [[set-top box]]: the piece of endpoint equipment that decodes and decrypts TV and VOD streams for display on the TV screen.\n\n===Architecture of a video server network===\nDepending on the network architecture of the service provider, there are two main types of video server architecture that can be considered for IPTV deployment: centralised and distributed.\n\nThe centralised architecture model is a relatively simple and easy to manage solution. Because all media content is stored in centralised servers, it does not require a comprehensive content distribution system. Centralised architecture is generally good for a network that provides relatively small VOD service deployment, has adequate core and edge bandwidth and has an efficient [[content delivery network]] (CDN).\n\nDistributed architecture is just as scalable as the centralised model, however it has bandwidth usage advantages and inherent system management features that are essential for managing a larger server network. Operators who plan to deploy a relatively large system should therefore consider implementing a distributed architecture model right from the start. Distributed architecture requires intelligent and sophisticated content distribution technologies to augment effective delivery of multimedia contents over service provider's network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inwf.com/pubs/print/aroc58_toc.html|title=inwf.com|author=|date=|website=www.inwf.com|access-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222175000/http://www.inwf.com/pubs/print/aroc58_toc.html|archive-date=22 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Residential IPTV home networks===\nIn many cases, the [[residential gateway]] that provides connectivity with the [[Internet access]] network is not located close to the IPTV set-top box.

Playback requires a broadband device connected to either a fixed or wireless IP network in the form of either a standalone [[personal computer]] or limited embedded [[Operating system|OS]] device such as a [[smartphone]], [[Internet tablet|touch screen tablet]], [[game console]], [[connected TV]] or [[Set-top box#IPTV receiver|set-top box]].  Video compression is provided by either a [[H.263]] or [[H.264]] derived codec, audio is compressed via a [[MDCT]] based codec and then encapsulated in either an [[MPEG transport stream]] or [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]] packets or [[Flash Video]] packets for live or VoD streaming.  IP multicasting allows for live data to be sent to multiple receivers using a single multicast group address. [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]]/MPEG-4 AVC is commonly used for internet streaming over higher bit rate standards such as [[H.261]] and [[H.263]] which were more designed for [[ISDN]] video conferencing. [[H.262]]/MPEG-1/2 is generally not used as the bandwidth required would quite easily saturate a network which is why they are only used in single link broadcast or storage applications.\n\nIn standards-based IPTV systems, the primary underlying protocols used are:\n* Service provider-based streaming:\n** [[IGMP]] for subscribing to a live multicast stream (TV channel) and for changing from one live multicast stream to another (TV channel change). IP multicast operates within LANs (including VLANs) and across WANs also. IP multicast is usually routed in the network core by [[Protocol Independent Multicast]] (PIM), setting up correct distribution of multicast streams (TV channels) from their source all the way to the customers who wants to view them, duplicating received packets as needed.  On-demand content uses a negotiated unicast connection. [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP) over [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) or the lower overhead [[H.222]] transport stream over [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) are generally the preferred methods of encapsulation.\n* [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based [[unicast]] only live and VoD streaming:\n** [[Adobe Flash Player]] prefers [[Real Time Messaging Protocol|RTMP]] over TCP with setup and control via either [[Action Message Format|AMF]] or [[XML]] or [[JSON]] transactions.\n** Apple iOS uses [[HTTP Live Streaming|HLS]] [[adaptive bitrate streaming]] over [[HTTP]] with setup and control via an embedded [[M3U]] playlist file.\n** Microsoft Silverlight uses [[Smooth Streaming|smooth streaming]] ([[adaptive bitrate streaming]]) over HTTP.\n* Web-based multicast live and unicast VoD streaming:\n** The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) recommends RTP over UDP or [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] transports with setup and control using [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]] over TCP.\n* [[Connected TV]]s, [[game console]]s, [[Set-top box#IPTV receiver|set-top boxes]] and [[network personal video recorder]]s:\n** local network content uses [[Universal Plug and Play#UPnP AV standards|UPnP AV]] for [[unicast]] via HTTP over TCP or for multicast live RTP over UDP.\n** Web-based content is provided through either inline Web plug-ins or a television broadcast-based application that uses a [[middleware]] language such as [[MHEG-5]] that triggers an event such as loading an inline Web browser using an [[Adobe Flash Player]] plug-in.\n\nA telecommunications company IPTV service is usually delivered over an investment-heavy [[Walled garden (technology)|walled garden network]].\n\nLocal IPTV, as used by businesses for [[audio visual]] AV distribution on their company networks is typically based on a mixture of:\n# Conventional TV reception equipment and IPTV encoders\n# IP[[TV gateway]]s that take broadcast MPEG channels and IP wrap them to create multicast streams.\n\n==Via satellite==\nAlthough IPTV and conventional [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] distribution have been seen as complementary technologies, they are likely to be increasingly used together in hybrid IPTV networks that deliver the highest levels of performance and reliability. IPTV is largely neutral to the transmission medium, and IP traffic is already routinely carried by satellite for [[Internet backbone]] trunking and corporate [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] networks.<ref>Berlocher, Greg and Freyer, Dan. \"IP And Satellite: Communications Worlds Merging\" ''Via Satellite'' January 2009 p 24\u201328</ref> The use of satellite to carry IP is fundamental to overcoming the greatest shortcoming of IPTV over terrestrial cables \u2013 the speed/bandwidth of the connection, as well as availability.\n\nThe copper twisted pair cabling that forms the [[last mile]] of the telephone and broadband network in many countries is not able to provide a sizeable proportion of the population with an IPTV service that matches even existing terrestrial or satellite digital TV distribution. For a competitive multi-channel TV service, a connection speed of 20&nbsp;Mbit/s is likely to be required, but unavailable to most potential customers.<ref>Taga, Karim. \"Hybrid delivery of content for IPTV\" ''InterComms'' Issue 11 August 2008 p 13\u201314</ref> The increasing popularity of [[high-definition television]] (with twice the data rate of [[Standard-definition television|SD video]]) increases connection speed requirements, or limits IPTV service quality and connection eligibility even further.\n\nHowever, satellites are capable of delivering in excess of 100&nbsp;Gbit/s via multi-spot beam technologies, making satellite a clear emerging technology for implementing IPTV networks. Satellite distribution can be included in an IPTV network architecture in several ways. The simplest to implement is an IPTV-[[Direct-broadcast satellite|direct to home]] (DTH) architecture, in which hybrid DVB-broadband [[set-top box]]es in subscriber homes integrate satellite and IP reception to give near-infinite bandwidth with return channel capabilities. In such a system, many live TV channels may be multicast via satellite (IP-encapsulated or as conventional [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] digital TV) with stored video-on-demand transmission via the broadband connection. [[Arqiva]]\u2019s Satellite Media Solutions Division suggests \"IPTV works best in a hybrid format.

Since the emergence of online video aggregation sites, like [[YouTube]] and [[Vimeo]] in the mid-2000s, traditional [[pay TV]] operators have come under increasing pressure to provide their subscribers with a means of viewing [[Internet]]-based video [both professional and user-generated] on their televisions. At the same time, specialist [[Internet Protocol|IP]]-based operators [often telecommunications providers] have looked for ways to offer [[Analog television|analogue]] and [[digital terrestrial]] services to their operations, without adding either additional cost or complexity to their transmission operations. [[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]] is a valuable asset for operators, so many have looked for alternative ways to deliver these new services without investing in additional network infrastructures.\n\nA hybrid set-top allows content from a range of sources, including [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] broadcast, satellite, and cable, to be brought together with video delivered over the Internet via an Ethernet connection on the device. This enables television viewers to access a greater variety of content on their TV sets, without the need for a separate box for each service.\n\nHybrid IPTV set-top boxes also enable users to access a range of advanced interactive services, such as [[Video on demand|VOD]] / catch-up TV, as well as Internet applications, including [[Videotelephony|video telephony]], surveillance, gaming, shopping, [[E-Government|e-government]] accessed via a [[television set]].\n\nFrom a [[pay-TV]] operator's perspective, a hybrid IPTV set-top box gives them greater long-term flexibility by enabling them to deploy new services and applications as and when consumers require, most often without the need to upgrade equipment or for a technician to visit and reconfigure or swap out the device. This reduces the cost of launching new services, increases speed to market and limits disruption for consumers.<ref>[http://www.v-net.tv/Webcast.aspx?id=5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405064453/http://www.v-net.tv/Webcast.aspx?id=5 |date=5 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] (HbbTV) consortium of industry companies is currently{{When|date=January 2012}} promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast and broadband digital TV and multimedia applications with a single user interface.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=HbbTV Consortium |date=27 August 2009 |url=http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |title=New European initiative merges television with the power of the Internet |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007125549/http://www.hbbtv.org/news/HBBTV_PR_Final.pdf |archive-date=7 October 2009 }}</ref> These trends led to the development of [[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]] set-top boxes that included both a [[ATSC tuner|broadcast tuner]] and an [[Internet access|Internet connection]]&nbsp;\u2013 usually an [[Ethernet]] port. The first commercially available hybrid IPTV set-top box was developed by [[Advanced Digital Broadcast]], a developer of digital television hardware and software, in 2005. The platform was developed for Spanish pay TV operator [[Telefonica]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltvnews.net/items/060911adb_spain.htm |title=ADB Delivers World's First Hybrid, Single-Chip, Advanced Video Coding, High Definition IPTV Set-Top Boxes To TELEF\u00d3NICA |publisher=Digitaltvnews.net |date= |access-date=15 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227141252/http://www.digitaltvnews.net/items/060911adb_spain.htm |archive-date=27 February 2012 }}</ref> and used as part of its Movistar TV service, launched to subscribers at the end of 2005.\n\nAn alternative approach is the IPTV version of the [[Headend in the Sky]] cable TV solution. Here, multiple TV channels are distributed via satellite to the ISP or IPTV provider's [[point of presence]] (POP) for IP-encapsulated distribution to individual subscribers as required by each subscriber.\n\nThis can provide a huge selection of channels to subscribers without overburdening Internet trunking to the POP, and enables an IPTV service to be offered to small or remote operators outside the reach of terrestrial high speed broadband connection. An example is a network combining fibre and satellite distribution via an [[SES New Skies]] satellite of 95 channels to Latin America and the Caribbean, operated by IPTV Americas.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=IPTV Americas |date=13 January 2009 |url=http://www.iptv-americas.tv/releaseDB.php?leng=&notID=47 |title=IPTV Americas Launches First IPTV Satellite Distribution Platform for Latin America and The Caribbean via SES NEW SKIES' NSS-806 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016015125/http://www.iptv-americas.tv/releaseDB.php?leng=&notID=47 |archive-date=16 October 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nWhile the future development of IPTV probably lies with a number of coexisting architectures and implementations, it is clear{{According to whom|date=January 2012}} that broadcasting of high bandwidth applications such as IPTV is accomplished more efficiently and cost-effectively using satellite<ref>International Datacasting Corporation [http://www.datacast.com/pg_SolutionIndex.php \"Why IP Over Satellite?\"].

Retrieved 18 January 2009.</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nThe Internet protocol-based platform offers significant advantages, including the ability to integrate television with other IP-based services like high speed Internet access and VoIP.\n\nA switched IP network also allows for the delivery of significantly more content and functionality. In a typical TV or satellite network, using broadcast video technology, all the content constantly flows downstream to each customer, and the customer switches the content at the set-top box. The customer can select from as many choices as the telecomms, cable or satellite company can stuff into the \"pipe\" flowing into the home. A switched IP network works differently. Content remains in the network, and only the content the customer selects is sent into the customer's home. That frees up bandwidth, and the customer's choice is less restricted by the size of the \"pipe\" into the home. This also implies that the customer's privacy could be compromised to a greater extent than is possible with traditional TV or satellite networks. It may also provide a means to hack into, or at least disrupt (see [[Denial-of-service attack|Denial of service]]) the private network.\n\n===Economics===\nThe cable industry's expenditures of approximately $1 billion per year are based on network updates to accommodate higher data speeds. Most operators use 2\u20133 channels to support maximum data speeds of 50&nbsp;Mbit/s to 100&nbsp;Mbit/s. However, because video streams require a high bit rate for much longer periods of time, the expenditures to support high amounts of video traffic will be much greater. This phenomenon is called persistency. Data persistency is routinely 5% while video persistency can easily reach 50%. As video traffic continues to grow, this means that significantly more [[Cable modem termination system|CMTS]] downstream channels will be required to carry this video content. Based on today's market, it is likely that industry expenditures for CMTS expansion could exceed $2 billion a year, virtually all of that expenditure being driven by video traffic. Adoption of IPTV for carrying the majority of this traffic could save the industry approximately 75% of this capital expenditure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.curvedview.com/economics-iptv/|title=The Economics of IPTV|date=2 February 2015|language=en-US|access-date=23 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920030343/http://www.curvedview.com/economics-iptv/|archive-date=20 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Interactivity===\nAn IP-based platform also allows significant opportunities to make the TV viewing experience more interactive and personalised.\nThe supplier may, for example, include an interactive programme guide that allows viewers to search for content by title or actor's name, or a [[picture-in-picture]] functionality that allows them to \"channel surf\" without leaving the programme they're watching. Viewers may be able to look up a player's stats while watching a sports game, or control the camera angle. They also may be able to access photos or music from their PC on their television, use a wireless phone to schedule a recording of their favourite show, or even adjust parental controls so their child can watch a documentary for a school report, while they're away from home.\n\nIn order that there can take place an interaction between the receiver and the transmitter, a feedback channel is needed. Due to this, terrestrial, satellite, and cable networks for television do not allow interactivity. However, interactivity with those networks can be possible by combining TV networks with data networks such as the [[Internet]] or a mobile communication network.\n\n===Video-on-demand===\nIPTV technology is bringing [[video on demand]] (VoD) to television,<ref>[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ Broadband Users Control What They Watch and When] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420143608/http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2010/04/06/broadband-users-control-watch/ |date=20 April 2010 }}</ref> which permits a customer to browse an online programme or film catalogue, to watch trailers and to then select a selected recording. The [[playout]] of the selected item starts nearly instantaneously on the customer's TV or PC.\n\nTechnically, when the customer selects the movie, a [[Point-to-Point Protocol|point-to-point]] unicast connection is set up between the customer's decoder (set-top box or PC) and the delivering streaming server. The signalling for the trick play functionality (pause, slow-motion, wind/rewind etc.) is assured by RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol).\n\nThe most common codecs used for VoD are [[MPEG-2]], [[MPEG-4]] and [[VC-1]].\n\nIn an attempt to avoid content piracy, the VoD content is usually encrypted. Whilst [[encryption]] of satellite and cable TV broadcasts is an old practice, with IPTV technology it can effectively be thought of as a form of [[Digital rights management]]. A film that is chosen, for example, may be playable for 24 hours following payment, after which time it becomes unavailable.\n\n===IPTV-based converged services===\nAnother advantage is the opportunity for integration and convergence. This opportunity is amplified when using IMS-based solutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Session and Media Signalling for IPTV via IMS|url=http://c-mobile.ptinovacao.pt/files/PaperMobilWare2008.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625075612/http://c-mobile.ptinovacao.pt/files/PaperMobilWare2008.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 June 2008|website=MobileWare'08|authors=Riede, Christian & Al-Hezmi, Adel & Magedanz, Thomas||location= Innsbruck, Austria||isbn=|date=12 February 2008 }}</ref> Converged services implies interaction of existing services in a seamless manner to create new value added services. One example is on-screen [[Caller ID]], getting Caller ID on a TV, and the ability to handle it (send it to voice mail, etc.). IP-based services help to enable efforts to provide consumers anytime-anywhere access to content over their televisions, PCs, and mobile device, and to integrate services and content to tie them together. Within businesses and institutions, IPTV eliminates the need to run a parallel infrastructure to deliver live and stored video services.\n\n==Limitations==\nIPTV is sensitive to packet loss and delays if the streamed data is unreliable. IPTV has strict minimum speed requirements in order to facilitate the right number of frames per second to deliver moving pictures. This means that the limited connection speed and bandwidth available for a large IPTV customer base can reduce the service quality delivered.\n\nAlthough a few countries have very high-speed broadband-enabled populations, such as [[South Korea]] with 6 million homes benefiting from a minimum connection speed of 100&nbsp;Mbit/s, in other countries (such as the UK) legacy networks struggle to provide 3\u20135&nbsp;Mbit/s<ref>Bulkley, Kate. \"IPTV\u2019s Eastern Promise\" ''Digital TV Europe'' October 2008 p 48</ref>{{Update after|2013|8|13}} and so simultaneous provision to the home of TV channels, VOIP and Internet access may not be viable. The last-mile delivery for IPTV usually has a bandwidth restriction that only allows a small number of simultaneous TV channel streams&nbsp;\u2013 typically from one to three&nbsp;\u2013 to be delivered.<ref>Brown, Peter J. \"Super Headends And High Expectations\" ''Via Satellite'' April 2006 p 18\u201330</ref>\n\nStreaming IPTV across wireless links within the home has proved troublesome; not due to bandwidth limitations as many{{Who|date=January 2012}} assume, but due to issues with multipath and reflections of the RF signal carrying the IP data packets. An IPTV stream is sensitive to packets arriving at the right time and in the right order. Improvements in wireless technology are now{{When|date=January 2012}} starting to provide equipment to solve the problem.<ref>Market Wire [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091001092108/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200806/ai_n26682515 \"ZyXEL Announces Industry's First ADSL2/2+ 802.11n Gateway and New IPTV Product Offerings\"] June 2008</ref>\n\nDue to the limitations of wireless, most IPTV service providers today use wired home networking technologies instead of wireless technologies like [[IEEE 802.11]]. Service providers such as AT&T (which makes extensive use of wireline home networking as part of its [[AT&T U-verse]] IPTV service) have expressed support for the work done in this direction by [[ITU-T]], which has adopted Recommendation [[G.hn]] (also known as G.9960), which is a next-generation home networking standard that specifies a common PHY/MAC that can operate over any home wiring (power lines, phone lines or coaxial cables).<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/homepna-homegrid-sign-liaison-agreement/story.aspx?guid={C8E4BB07-375A-41E5-8B05-2E33222E44C2}&dist=msr_9 HomePNA and HomeGrid Sign Liaison Agreement]{{dead link|date=February 2016}}, Groups Work to Promote New ITU G.hn Global Wired Home Networking Standard</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everywire.com/2009/02/att-participating-in-ghn-standard-development-1.html|title=AT&T Participating in G.hn Standard Development|author=|date=|website=everywire.com|access-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810051112/http://www.everywire.com/2009/02/att-participating-in-ghn-standard-development-1.html|archive-date=10 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Latency===\nThe [[latency (engineering)|latency]] inherent in the use of [[Satellite Internet access|satellite Internet]] is often held up as reason why satellites cannot be successfully used for IPTV. In practice, however, latency is not an important factor for IPTV, since it is a service that does not require real-time transmission, as is the case with telephony or videoconferencing services.\n\nIt is the latency of response to requests to change channel, display an EPG, etc. that most affects customers\u2019 perceived quality of service, and these problems affect satellite IPTV no more than terrestrial IPTV. Command latency problems, faced by terrestrial IPTV networks with insufficient bandwidth as their customer base grows, may be solved by the high capacity of satellite distribution.\n\nSatellite distribution does suffer from latency&nbsp;\u2013 the time for the signal to travel up from the hub to the satellite and back down to the user is around 0.25 seconds, and cannot be reduced. However, the effects of this delay are mitigated in real-life systems using data compression, TCP-acceleration, and HTTP pre-fetching.<ref>Newtec Productions NV [http://www.newtec.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/product_leaflets/sat3Play/Sat3Play_Ku-band_Terminal_TP210_R1.pdf \"TP210 Sat3Play Broadband Terminal\"] (Version R2/06.2010).

Existing [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] TV channels that [[simulcast]] by both terrestrial and satellite transmissions experience the same 0.25-second delay difference between the two services with no detrimental effect, and it goes unnoticed by viewers.\n\n==Bandwidth requirements==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Figure2a.jpg|thumb|400px|Bandwidth capacity for simultaneously two HDTV streams, two SD streams, additional to HSD and voice]]\n\nDigital video is a combination of sequence of digital images, and they are made up of [[pixel]]s or picture elements. Each pixel has two values, which are [[luminance]] and [[chrominance]]. Luminance is representing intensity of the pixel; chrominance represents the colour of the pixel. Three bytes would be used to represent the colour of the high quality image for a true colour technique. A sequence of images is creating the digital video, in that case, images are called as frames.\n\nMovies use 24 frames per second; however, the rate of the frames can change according to territories' electrical systems so that there are different kinds of frame rates, for instance, North America is using approximately 30 frames per second where the Europe television frame rate is 25 frames per second. Each digital video has dimensions width and height; when referred to analogue television, the dimension for SDTV is 720\u00d7480 pixels, on the other hand, numerous HDTV requires 1920\u00d71080 pixels. Moreover, whilst for SDTV, two bytes (16 bits) is enough to create the colour depth, HDTV requires three bytes (24 bits) to create the colour depth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThereby, with a rate of 30 frames/second, the uncompressed data rate for SDTV becomes 30\u00d7720\u00d7480\u00d716,{{vague|date=July 2017}} in other words, 147,456,000 bits per second. Moreover, for HDTV, at the same frame rate, uncompressed date rate becomes 30\u00d71920\u00d71080\u00d724 or 1,492,992,000 bits per second. Using that simple calculation, a service provider's service delivery to the subscribers is limited unless a lossy compression method is used.\n\nThere is no absolute answer for the bandwidth requirement for the IPTV service because the bandwidth requirement is increasing due to the devices inside the household. Thus, currently compressed HDTV content can be delivered at a data rate between 8 and 10&nbsp;Mbit/s, but if the home of the consumer equipped with several HDTV outputs, this rate will be multiplied respectively.\n\nThe high-speed data transfer will increase the needed bandwidth for the viewer, at least 2&nbsp;Mbit/s is needed to use web-based applications on the computer. Additionally to that, 64&nbsp;kbit/s is required to use landline telephone for the property. In minimal usage, to receive an IPTV triple-play service requires 13&nbsp;Mbit/s to process in a household.\n\n==Privacy implications==\nDue to limitations in bandwidth, an IPTV channel is delivered to the user one at a time, as opposed to the traditional multiplexed delivery. Changing a channel requires requesting the head-end server to provide a different broadcast stream, much like [[Video on demand|VOD]] (For VOD the stream is delivered using [[unicast]], for the normal TV signal multicast is used). This could enable the service provider to accurately track each and every programme watched and the duration of watching for each viewer; broadcasters and advertisers could then understand their audience and programming better with accurate data and [[targeted advertising]].\n\nIn conjunction with regulatory differences between IPTV and cable TV, this tracking could pose a threat to privacy according to critics.<ref>[http://www.cedmagazine.com/iptv-privacy-risks.aspx IPTV privacy risks<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105172921/http://www.cedmagazine.com/iptv-privacy-risks.aspx |date=5 January 2010 }}</ref>  For IP multicast scenarios, since a particular multicast group (TV channel) needs to be requested before it can be viewed, the same privacy concerns apply.\n\n==Vendors==\nGlobal sales of IPTV systems exceeded US$2 billion in 2007, although only a small number of companies supply most current IPTV system solutions. Some, such as [[Movistar TV]], were formed by telecoms operators themselves, to minimise external costs, a tactic also used by [[PCCW]] of [[Hong Kong]]. Some major telecoms vendors are also active in this space, notably [[Accenture]] (Accenture Video Solution), [[Alcatel-Lucent]] (sometimes working with Movistar TV), [[Ericsson]] (notably since acquiring [[Tandberg Television]]), [[Huawei]], [[NEC]], [[PTCL Smart TV]], [[Sri Lanka Telecom]], [[Thomson SA|Thomson]], and [[ZTE]], as are some IT houses, led by [[Microsoft]]. Delaware-based AlphaOTT Tokyo-based The New Media Group, Malaysian-based [[Select-TV]], Oslo/Norway-based SnapTV, and California-based [[UTStarcom]], Inc. also offer end-to-end networking infrastructure for IPTV-based services, and Hong Kong-based BNS Ltd. provides turnkey open platform IPTV technology solutions. \n\nChannel PEAR is a \"collaborative, cloud-based media platform\"<ref>{{cite web|website=Channel PEAR |title=Login|url=https://channelpear.com/login/}}</ref> that allows users to create a private channel<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thestreamingadvisor.com/add-channel-pear-back-to-roku/|website=The Streaming Advisor|title= HOW TO PLEX: What Happened To Channel Pear On Roku How to Get It Back| author=Downey, Ryan|date=October 25, 2017}}</ref> on which they can discover, share, and view video files, MRSS feeds, and live IPTV streams from around the world, through devices such as [[Kodi (software)|Kodi]],<ref>{{cite web|website=Addictive Tips|url=https://www.addictivetips.com/media-streaming/channel-pear-kodi-addon/|title=Channel Pear Kodi Add-on, Installation Tutorial and Discovery| author=Larue-Langlois, Renaud Larue-Langlois|date= September 16, 2017}}</ref> [[Plex (software)|Plex]],<ref>{{cite web|website=Plex TV Forums|url=https://forums.plex.tv/t/rel-channel-pear-live-stream-discovery-iptv/113612|title=Channel Pear Live Stream Discovery}}</ref> and [[Roku]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Roku Guide|url=https://www.rokuguide.com/private-channels/channel-pear|title=Private Channels: Channel PEAR}}</ref>\n\nHospitality IPTV Ltd, having established many closed network IPTV systems, expanded in 2013 to OTT delivery platforms for markets in New Zealand, Australia, and Asia Pacific region.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[Google Fiber]] offers an IPTV service in various US cities which includes up to 1 Gigabit-speed internet and over 290 channels depending on package via the fiber optic network being built out in Kansas City Kansas and Kansas City Missouri.\n\nPEAR IPTV self-declares as \"the leading IPTV provider in the world\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://peariptv.com/|website= PEAR IPTV|title =Home Page}}</ref>\n\nMany of these IPTV solution vendors participated in the biennial Multiservice Switching Forum Interoperability 2008 (GMI) event which was coordinated by the [[MultiService Forum]] (MSF) at five sites worldwide from 20 to 31 October 2008. Test equipment vendors including Netrounds, [[Codenomicon]], [[Empirix]], Ixia, [[Mu Dynamics]] and [[Spirent]] joined solution vendors such as the companies listed above in one of the largest IPTV proving grounds ever deployed.\n\n==Service bundling==\nFor residential users, IPTV is often provided in conjunction with [[video on demand]] and may be bundled with [[Internet service]]s such as [[Internet access]] and [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) telecommunications services. Commercial bundling of IPTV, VoIP and Internet access is sometimes referred to in marketing as ''[[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]]'' service.  When these three are offered with cellular service, the combined service may be referred to as ''[[quadruple play]]''.\n\n==Regulation==\nHistorically, broadcast television has been regulated differently from telecommunications. As IPTV allows TV and VoD to be transmitted over IP networks, new regulatory issues arise.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/publications/ericsson_business_review/pdf/308/308_38_41_reshaping.pdf |title= Ericsson report on need for regulation |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081115174848/http://www.ericsson.com/ericsson/corpinfo/publications/ericsson_business_review/pdf/308/308_38_41_reshaping.pdf |archive-date= 15 November 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(217&nbsp;KB)}}</ref>\nProfessor Eli M.
