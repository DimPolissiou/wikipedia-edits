Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. 13 ed. [[Oxford University Press|OUP]]. 2011. p 583. (This source refers to England before the commencement of the Suicide Act 1961).</ref> However, while suicide has been decriminalized in many western countries, the act is still [[stigmatized]] and discouraged. In other contexts, suicide could be utilized as an extreme expression of liberty, as is exemplified by its usage as an expression of devout dissent towards perceived tyranny or injustice which occurred occasionally in cultures like [[ancient Rome]] or medieval [[Japan]].\n\nWhile a person who has committed suicide is beyond the reach of the law, there can still be legal consequences in the cases of treatment of the corpse or the fate of the person's property or family members. The associated matters of [[assisted suicide|assisting a suicide]] and [[Suicide attempt|attempting suicide]] have also been dealt with by the laws of some jurisdictions. Some countries [[Suicide attempt#Criminalization of attempted suicide|criminalise suicide attempts]].\n\nHistorically, laws against suicide and [[mercy killing]] have developed from [[religious doctrine]], for example, the claim that only [[God]] has the right to determine when a person will die.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n==History==\nIn [[ancient Athens]], a person who had committed suicide (without the approval of the state) was denied the honours of a normal burial. The person would be buried alone, on the outskirts of the city, without a headstone or marker.<ref>[[Plato]]. ''Laws'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/laws.9.ix.html Book IX]</ref> A criminal ordinance issued by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1670 was far more severe in its punishment: the dead person's body was drawn through the streets, face down, and then hung or thrown on a garbage heap. Additionally, all of the person's property was confiscated.<ref>[[\u00c9mile Durkheim|Durkheim, \u00c9mile]] (1897). ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]''. New York: The Free Press (reprint, 1997), 327. {{ISBN|0-684-83632-7}}.</ref>\n\nThe '[[Burial of Suicide Act]]' of 1823 abolished the legal requirement in England of burying suicides at crossroads.<ref>Also called the Felo de se Act 1823, the Interments (felo de se) Act 1823, the Burials (Felo de se) Act 1823, and the Suicide Act 1823.</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OyZOAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=%224+Geo+4+c+52%22#v=onepage&q=%224%20Geo%204%20c%2052%22&f=false|title=A History of the Criminal Law of England|author=James Fitzjames Stephen|isbn=9781108060745|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014}}</ref>\n\nEven in modern times, legal penalties for the act of suicide have not been uncommon. By 1879, English law had begun to distinguish between suicide and [[homicide]], though suicide still resulted in forfeiture of estate. Also, the deceased were permitted daylight burial in 1882.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n==Assisted suicide==\n{{Main|Assisted suicide}}\nIn many [[jurisdictions]] it is a crime to assist others, directly or indirectly, in taking their own lives. In some jurisdictions, it is also illegal to encourage them to do so. Sometimes an exception applies for physician assisted suicide (PAS), under strict conditions.\n\n==Laws in individual jurisdictions (table)==\n <!-- Note: this table is solely based on the penal code of each country.

She wished to be able to commit suicide at a time of her own choosing, but would require assistance to do so, because her physical condition prevented her from doing so without assistance. By a 5-4 majority, the Court held that the prohibition on assisted suicide did not infringe [[Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|s 7 of the ''Canadian Charter of RIghts and Freedoms'']], which provides constitutional protection for liberty and security of the person. The majority held that while the law did affect those rights, it did so in a manner consistent with the principles of fundamental justice. The majority also held that the prohibition on assisted suicide did not infringe the Charter's prohibition against [[Section Twelve of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|cruel and unusual treatment or punishment]].

With respect to [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] the simple act of suicide is lawful but the consequences of dying by suicide might turn an individual event into an unlawful act, as in the case of Reeves v Commissioners of Police of the Metropolis [2000] 1 AC 360,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldjudgmt/jd990715/reeves01.htm |title=House of Lords - Commissioners of Police for the Metropolis v. Reeves (A.P.) (Joint Administratix of the Estate of Martin Lynch, Deceased) |publisher=Parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-07}}</ref> where a man in police custody hanged himself and was held equally liable with the police (a cell door defect enabled the hanging) for the loss suffered by his widow; the practical effect was to reduce the police damages liability by 50%. In 2009, the House of Lords ruled that the law concerning the treatment of people who accompanied those who committed assisted suicide was unclear, following [[Debbie Purdy]]'s case that this lack of clarity was a breach of her human rights. (In her case, as a sufferer from multiple sclerosis, she wanted to know whether her husband would be prosecuted for accompanying her abroad where she might eventually wish to commit assisted suicide, if her illness progressed.)\n\n====Scotland====\nSuicide directly involving only the deceased person is not by itself a criminal offence under Scots Law and has not been in recent history. However, attempting suicide might be a [[Breach of the peace]] if it is not done as a private act; this is routinely reported in the case of persons threatening suicide in areas frequented by the public. The Suicide Act 1961 applies only to England and Wales but under [[Scots Law]] a person who assists a suicide might be charged with murder, [[culpable homicide]], or no offence depending upon the facts of each case. Despite not being a criminal offence, consequential liability upon the person attempting suicide (or if successful, his/her estate) might arise under civil law where it parallels the civil liabilities recognised in the (English Law) Reeves case mentioned above.\n\n===United States===\nHistorically, various states listed the act of suicide as a felony, but these policies were sparsely enforced. In the late 1960s, 18 U.S. states had no laws against suicide.<ref>{{citation |volume=6 |publisher=Washburn L.J. |page=395 |date=1966\u20131967 |title=Medical-Legal Aspects of Suicide |author=Litman, Robert E. |url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/wasbur6&section=41}}</ref> By the late 1980s, 30 of the 50 states had no laws against suicide or suicide attempts, but every state had laws declaring it to be a felony to aid, advise, or encourage another person to commit suicide.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Approaches and commonalities of suicide |author=ES Shneidman |publisher=Suicide and its prevention |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=6d3777E9uAEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA14|page=24 |title=Suicide and Its Prevention: The Role of Attitude and Imitation|isbn=9789004086135|year=1989 }}</ref> By the early 1990s only two states still listed suicide as a crime, and these have since removed that classification.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In some U.S. states, suicide is still considered an unwritten \"[[common law crime]],\" as stated in ''[[Blackstone's Commentaries]]''. (So held the [[Virginia Supreme Court]] in 1992. ''Wackwitz v. Roy'', 418 S.E.2d 861 (Va. 1992)). As a common law crime, suicide can bar recovery for the late suicidal person's family in a lawsuit unless the suicidal person can be proven to have been \"of unsound mind.\" That is, the suicide must be proven to have been an involuntary act of the victim in order for the family to be awarded monetary damages by the court. This can occur when the family of the deceased sues the caregiver (perhaps a jail or hospital) for negligence in failing to provide appropriate care.<ref>[http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/33/2/176 On Sound and Unsound Mind: The Role of Suicide in Tort and Insurance Litigation], ''Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law'', 2005</ref> Some American legal scholars look at the issue as one of personal liberty.

She wished to be able to commit suicide at a time of her own choosing, but would require assistance to do so, because her physical condition prevented her from doing so without assistance. By a 5-4 majority, the Court held that the prohibition on assisted suicide did not infringe [[Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|s 7 of the ''Canadian Charter of RIghts and Freedoms'']], which provides constitutional protection for liberty and security of the person. The majority held that while the law did affect those rights, it did so in a manner consistent with the principles of fundamental justice. The majority also held that the prohibition on assisted suicide did not infringe the Charter's prohibition against [[Section Twelve of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|cruel and unusual treatment or punishment]].

With respect to [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] the simple act of suicide is lawful but the consequences of dying by suicide might turn an individual event into an unlawful act, as in the case of Reeves v Commissioners of Police of the Metropolis [2000] 1 AC 360,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldjudgmt/jd990715/reeves01.htm |title=House of Lords - Commissioners of Police for the Metropolis v.

(Joint Administratix of the Estate of Martin Lynch, Deceased) |publisher=Parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-07}}</ref> where a man in police custody hanged himself and was held equally liable with the police (a cell door defect enabled the hanging) for the loss suffered by his widow; the practical effect was to reduce the police damages liability by 50%. In 2009, the House of Lords ruled that the law concerning the treatment of people who accompanied those who committed assisted suicide was unclear, following [[Debbie Purdy]]'s case that this lack of clarity was a breach of her human rights. (In her case, as a sufferer from multiple sclerosis, she wanted to know whether her husband would be prosecuted for accompanying her abroad where she might eventually wish to commit assisted suicide, if her illness progressed.)\n\n====Scotland====\nSuicide directly involving only the deceased person is not by itself a criminal offence under Scots Law and has not been in recent history. However, attempting suicide might be a [[Breach of the peace]] if it is not done as a private act; this is routinely reported in the case of persons threatening suicide in areas frequented by the public. The Suicide Act 1961 applies only to England and Wales but under [[Scots Law]] a person who assists a suicide might be charged with murder, [[culpable homicide]], or no offence depending upon the facts of each case. Despite not being a criminal offence, consequential liability upon the person attempting suicide (or if successful, his/her estate) might arise under civil law where it parallels the civil liabilities recognised in the (English Law) Reeves case mentioned above.\n\n===United States===\nHistorically, various states listed the act of suicide as a felony, but these policies were sparsely enforced. In the late 1960s, 18 U.S. states had no laws against suicide.<ref>{{citation |volume=6 |publisher=Washburn L.J. |page=395 |date=1966\u20131967 |title=Medical-Legal Aspects of Suicide |author=Litman, Robert E. |url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/wasbur6&section=41}}</ref> By the late 1980s, 30 of the 50 states had no laws against suicide or suicide attempts, but every state had laws declaring it to be a felony to aid, advise, or encourage another person to commit suicide.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Approaches and commonalities of suicide |author=ES Shneidman |publisher=Suicide and its prevention |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=6d3777E9uAEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA14|page=24 |title=Suicide and Its Prevention: The Role of Attitude and Imitation|isbn=9789004086135|year=1989 }}</ref> By the early 1990s only two states still listed suicide as a crime, and these have since removed that classification.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In some U.S. states, suicide is still considered an unwritten \"[[common law crime]],\" as stated in ''[[Blackstone's Commentaries]]''. (So held the [[Virginia Supreme Court]] in 1992. ''Wackwitz v. Roy'', 418 S.E.2d 861 (Va. 1992)). As a common law crime, suicide can bar recovery for the late suicidal person's family in a lawsuit unless the suicidal person can be proven to have been \"of unsound mind.\" That is, the suicide must be proven to have been an involuntary act of the victim in order for the family to be awarded monetary damages by the court. This can occur when the family of the deceased sues the caregiver (perhaps a jail or hospital) for negligence in failing to provide appropriate care.<ref>[http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/33/2/176 On Sound and Unsound Mind: The Role of Suicide in Tort and Insurance Litigation], ''Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law'', 2005</ref> Some American legal scholars look at the issue as one of personal liberty.

Kelvin Hughes supplied many of the ship's components, including the [[Electronic Chart Display and Information System]] (ECDIS) and eight multifunction display units.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://magazines.marinelink.com/Magazines/MaritimeReporter/200108/content/kelvin-hughes-bridge-209053 |title=Kelvin Hughes Bridge Chosen For ''Queen Mary 2'' |magazine=Maritime Reporter and Engineering News |date=August 2001 |page=45 |publisher=New Wave Media}}</ref>\n\n===Water supply===\nFresh water aboard ''Queen Mary 2'' is supplied by three seawater [[desalination]] plants. The plants, each with a capacity of {{convert|630000|L|USgal}} per day, use [[Multiple-effect distillation|multiple effect]] plate (MEP) distillation technology. The plants' energy is supplied primarily by steam and cooling water from the ship's gas turbines and diesel engines, or if needed by steam from the ship's two oil-fired boilers. The traditional [[multiple-effect distillation]] technology has been improved for the ship's plant, so that [[Fouling#Micro fouling|scaling]] of plates is reduced, vastly reducing maintenance required. The desalinated water has a very low salt content of less than five parts per million. Average total water production is {{convert|1100000|L|USgal}} per day with a capacity of {{convert|1890000|L|USgal}} so that there is ample spare capacity. The ship could easily be supplied by only two of the three plants.<ref name=\"Alstom\">{{cite book | title= ''Queen Mary 2'': The Genesis of a Queen |publisher=Alstom Chantiers de l'Atlantique, A Publication of the Naval Architect | year = 2004 | pages = 50\u201355}}</ref> Potable water tanks have a capacity of {{convert|3830000|L|USgal}}, enough for more than three days of supply.<ref name=\"QM2tecspec\">Cunard. RMS Queen Mary 2 Technical Specification. Flyer made available to passengers of the ''Queen Mary 2''.</ref> If the engines are running on low load (when the ship is running at a slow speed) the engine jacket cooling water temperature is insufficient to heat the seawater to run the desalination plants. In that case steam from oil-fired boilers is used to heat the sea water. This is uneconomical as generating steam is expensive. It may be cheaper, therefore, to buy water in a particular port than to produce it on board. The seawater intakes are located in the hull of the ship. Concentrated salt solution ([[brine]]) is discharged to the sea closer to the ship's stern together with cooling water from the engines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infotechfrance.com/cgi-local/affichage_signet_secteur.pl?UNI_ID=8&RUB_ID=54&SS_ID=6746&SEC_ID=25 |title=UBIFRANCE Orelis' technology to recycle Queen Mary 2's waste water |date=16 April 2004  |publisher= |accessdate=26 November 2009}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> An additional plant was added during the 2016 refit.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Environmental performance===\n{{See also|Environmental impact of shipping}}\n\nWhen designing ''Queen Mary 2'', the designers considered that tighter environmental regulations would be implemented while the ship was in service, such as energy efficiency, the reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses and zero discharge of solid waste into the sea.<ref name=\"professional mariner\"/><ref name=\"QM2tecspec\"/>\n\nAccording to Cunard, the ship exceeds some requirements of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships ([[MARPOL 73/78]]) of the [[International Maritime Organization]]. It discharges waste into the sea only in areas more than {{convert|12|nmi|mi|abbr=on}} from any coast, even though MARPOL allows discharge of treated organic waste and treated bilge water closer to the shore. Discharges of potentially harmful substances, in particular the residual oil content of treated bilge water and air emissions, are monitored regularly to ensure compliance with environmental standards.<ref name=\"QM2tecspec\"/> In areas where air pollution from [[sulfur dioxide]], which causes [[acid rain]], is a concern, the ship switches to low-sulfur fuel to minimise air pollution.<ref name=\"QM2tecspec\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[carbon offset]] company [[Climate Care]], passenger ships release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per passenger mile than long haul flights. Cunard attempted to reduce the [[carbon footprint]] of ''Queen Mary 2'' by improving engine efficiency and reducing friction while the ship is in motion. In November 2008, the ship was given a refit in [[Hamburg]], part of which involved the repainting of the hull in paint which is designed to reduce drag and improve fuel economy.<ref name=\"QM2tecspec\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/dec/20/cruises.green |title=Is cruising any greener than flying? |date=20 December 2006 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref> According to [[Blohm+Voss]], her 2016 refit included the installation of \"scrubbers\" and exhaust gas filters to reduce emissions.<ref>{{cite press release|last=Brasse|first=Michael|date=23 May 2016|title=Master refit: The Queen Mary 2 docks at Blohm+Voss on May 27, 2016|url=http://www.blohmvoss.com/var/blohmvoss/storage/original/application/ea05ca9e3bab8c78463d07ae6006ba57.pdf|location=Hamburg, DE|publisher=Blohm+Voss GmbH|access-date=25 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n<!-- IMAGES IN THIS SECTION: Please do not add unnecessary images here - images should only be used to illustrate the text better; this is not a gallery.

With the retirement of ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' in 2008, ''Queen Mary 2'' is the only transatlantic ocean liner in regular service between [[Southampton]], England, and [[New York City]], United States. The ship is also used for cruising, including an annual world cruise.<ref>[http://www.cunard.com/Ships/Queen-Mary-2/ Queen Mary 2 Cruises] ''Cunard'' Retrieved 21 January 2012</ref>\n\nShe was designed by a team of British naval architects led by [[Stephen Payne (naval architect)|Stephen Payne]], and was constructed in France by [[Chantiers de l'Atlantique]].

Discharges of potentially harmful substances, in particular the residual oil content of treated bilge water and air emissions, are monitored regularly to ensure compliance with environmental standards.<ref name=\"QM2tecspec\"/> In areas where air pollution from [[sulfur dioxide]], which causes [[acid rain]], is a concern, the ship switches to low-sulfur fuel to minimise air pollution.<ref name=\"QM2tecspec\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[carbon offset]] company [[Climate Care]], passenger ships release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere per passenger mile than long haul flights. Cunard attempted to reduce the [[carbon footprint]] of ''Queen Mary 2'' by improving engine efficiency and reducing friction while the ship is in motion. In November 2008, the ship was given a refit in [[Hamburg]], part of which involved the repainting of the hull in paint which is designed to reduce drag and improve fuel economy.<ref name=\"QM2tecspec\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/dec/20/cruises.green |title=Is cruising any greener than flying? |date=20 December 2006 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref> According to [[Blohm+Voss]], her 2016 refit included the installation of \"scrubbers\" and exhaust gas filters to reduce emissions.<ref>{{cite press release|last=Brasse|first=Michael|date=23 May 2016|title=Master refit: The Queen Mary 2 docks at Blohm+Voss on May 27, 2016|url=http://www.blohmvoss.com/var/blohmvoss/storage/original/application/ea05ca9e3bab8c78463d07ae6006ba57.pdf|location=Hamburg, DE|publisher=Blohm+Voss GmbH|access-date=25 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n<!-- IMAGES IN THIS SECTION: Please do not add unnecessary images here - images should only be used to illustrate the text better; this is not a gallery.

''Queen Mary 2'' followed the route of the original ship ''Britannia'', calling first at Halifax, Nova Scotia. After a day there, she headed first upriver into the harbor, using her bow thrusters and swivel-pod motors to negotiate the tight turnaround to come back down close to the cityfront. A 21-gun salute and bagpipe band honored the ship.\n\nFrom Halifax, the ship sailed to Boston and was there for a full day at the cruise terminal (Boston was the terminus of the original crossing in 1840).

{"title_page": "Particles of the Kagoshima dialects", "text_new": "The [[grammatical particle]]s ({{lang|ja|\u52a9\u8a5e}} ''joshi'') used in the [[Kagoshima dialect]]s of Japanese have many features in common with those of other dialects spoken in [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], with some being unique to the Kagoshima dialects. Like [[japanese particles|standard Japanese particles]], they act as suffixes, adpositions or words immediately following the noun, verb, adjective or phrase that they modify, and are used to indicate the relationship between the various elements of a sentence.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://japanese.about.com/blparticles.htm | title=Japanese Particles | publisher=About.com | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.timwerx.net/language/particles.htm | title=Japanese Particles | first=Tim R. | last=Matheson | publisher=Tim's Takamatsu | year=2008 | accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref>\n\nUnlike central Japanese dialects, particles in the Kagoshima dialects are bound [[clitic]]s, as they have the effect of resyllabifying the last word they attach to. So, for example, the standard forms {{lang|ja|\u672c\u3092}} ''hon o'' \"book {{gcl|ACC}}\", {{lang|ja|\u66f8\u304d\u3092}} ''kaki o'' \"writing {{gcl|ACC}}\" and {{lang|ja|\u307e\u308a\u3092}} ''mari o'' \"ball {{gcl|ACC}}\" would be realized as {{IPA|/hoNno/}}, {{IPA|/kakjo/}} and {{IPA|/majo/}} ( \u2190 {{IPA|/ma\u027djo/}}) in most of northern and central Kagoshima, and {{IPA|/hoNnu/}}, {{IPA|/kakju/~/kaku/}} and {{IPA|/maju/}} ( \u2190 {{IPA|/ma\u027dju/}}) in parts of Kagoshima's southern mainland.<ref>Shibatani (1990), p. 210</ref>\n\nResyllabification has also led to the reanalysis of some particles in a few dialects. For instance, the topic particle ''(w)a'' has been completely superseded by the form ''na'' in [[Izumi, Kagoshima|Izumi]],<ref name=\"Izumi\">{{cite web | url=http://sky.geocities.jp/ryohusyokyoryu/izumigo.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234707/http://sky.geocities.jp/ryohusyokyoryu/izumigo.html | archivedate=2013-12-02 | script-title=ja:\u5317\u85a9\u51fa\u6c34\u8a9e\u3092\u8a71\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046\uff01 | language=Japanese |trans-title=Let's learn the Hokusatsu district Izumi dialect! | accessdate=2012-04-22}}</ref> which in most mainland dialects is merely a variant of ''(w)a'' after a moraic nasal.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Resyllabification rules ==\n\nWhen a word is followed by a particle that starts with a vowel (such as the topic particle {{lang|ja|\u306f}} ''a'', the accusative particle {{lang|ja|\u3092}} ''o'' or the dative particle {{lang|ja|\u3044}} ''i''), the final syllable of that word will be fused with the particle and be subject to Kagoshima's [[kagoshima dialect#Coalescence|vowel coalescence rules]] as well as other sound changes occurring in the regional dialect. As a simple example, when the word {{lang|ja|\u3053\u308c}} {{IPA|/ko\u027de/}} ''kore'' \"this\" is followed by the topic particle {{lang|ja|\u306f}} {{IPA|/a/}}, it becomes {{lang|ja|\u3053\u308a\u3083}} {{IPA|/ko\u027dja/}} ''korya'' \"this={{gcl|TOP}}\". A secondary sound change in Mainland Kagoshima then causes the medial {{IPA|/\u027dj/}} ''ry'' to become {{IPA|/j/}} ''y'', giving the common form {{lang|ja|\u3053\u3084}} {{IPA|/koja/}} ''koya'' \"this={{gcl|TOP}}\".\n\nTwo main exceptions to this rule exist:\n\n# If a word's underlying form ends in a moraic nasal (i.e. {{IPA|/N/}}), an [[Epenthesis|epenthetic]] {{IPA|/n/}} is inserted between the word and the particle. For example, {{lang|ja|\u672c}} {{IPA|/hoN/}} ''hon'' \"book\" becomes {{lang|ja|\u672c\u306f}} {{IPA|/hoNna/}} ''honna'' when fused with the topic particle.\n# If a word's underlying form ends in a long vowel or sequence of vowels, then an epenthetic consonant is sometimes inserted between the word and the topic particle. In the case of topic particle {{lang|ja|\u306f}} ''a'' and the accusative particle {{lang|ja|\u3092}} ''o'', the epenthetic consonant is {{IPA|/w/}}. In the case of the dative particle {{lang|ja|\u3044}} ''i'', the epenthetic consonant is {{IPA|/n/}}.

For example:\n\n:{{interlinear|lang=ja\n|top={{lang|ja|\u8239'''\u304b\u3089'''\u6765\u305f}} (''fune '''kara''' kita'')<ref>{{cite web | title=29 \u8239[\u3067]\uff08\u6765\u305f\uff09 | url=https://www2.ninjal.ac.jp/hogen/dp/gaj-pdf/gaj-map-legend/vol1/GAJ1-29.pdf | language=ja | access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n|fune{{=}}kara k-ita\n|boat{{=}}ABL come-PST\n|'(He) came by boat'}}\n\n:{{interlinear|lang=ja\n|top={{lang|ja|\u30d0\u30b9'''\u304b\u3089'''\u884c\u304f\u3067\u3048}} (''basu '''kara''' iku dee'')<ref name=\"SatoGrammar\" /> (Example from Koshikijima)\n|basu{{=}}kara ik-u{{=}}dee\n|bus{{=}}ABL go-NPST{{=}}CNSQ\n|'Since (I) go by bus'}}\n\nThe particle {{lang|ja|\u304b\u3089}} ''kara'' does not replace the other usages of {{lang|ja|\u3067}} ''de'' \"by\". For instance, it cannot be used to mark the tool used to achieve an action. So in the sentence \"to write ''with'' a brush\", {{lang|ja|\u3067}} ''de'' would be used.<ref name=\"SatoGrammar\" />\n\n(2) In the second, it can be used to mark the agent in an [[Passive voice#Adversative passive|adversative-passive]] sentence, replacing the standard particle {{lang|ja|\u306b}} ''ni''.

Depending on the word that precedes, it can also be pronounced {{lang|ja|\u3046}} ''u''.\n\nLike the particles {{lang|ja|\u3042}} ''a'' and {{lang|ja|\u3044}} ''i'', when {{lang|ja|\u3092}} ''o'' is added to a word, the final syllable of that word will be subject resyllabification. For instance, {{lang|ja|\u3053\u3044}} ''koi'' \"this\" becomes {{lang|ja|\u3053\u3088}} ''koyo'' \"this={{gcl|ACC}}\".\n\nExample:\n\n:{{interlinear|lang=ja\n|top={{lang|ja|\u307b\u3093'''\u306e'''\u8aad\u3093}} (''hon'''no''' yon'')\n|hon{{=}}o yo-n\n|book{{=}}ACC read-NPST\n|'(I) read a book.'}}\n\n==== oba and ba ====\nThe particle {{lang|ja|\u3092\u3070}} ''oba'' or {{lang|ja|\u3070}} ''ba'' marks a topicalized direct object.

Like [[japanese particles|standard Japanese particles]], they act as suffixes, adpositions or words immediately following the noun, verb, adjective or phrase that they modify, and are used to indicate the relationship between the various elements of a sentence.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://japanese.about.com/blparticles.htm | title=Japanese Particles | publisher=About.com | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.timwerx.net/language/particles.htm | title=Japanese Particles | first=Tim R. | last=Matheson | publisher=Tim's Takamatsu | year=2008 | accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref>\n\nUnlike central Japanese dialects, particles in the Kagoshima dialects are bound [[clitic]]s, as they have the effect of resyllabifying the last word they attach to. So, for example, the standard forms {{lang|ja|\u672c\u3092}} ''hon o'' \"book {{gcl|ACC}}\", {{lang|ja|\u66f8\u304d\u3092}} ''kaki o'' \"writing {{gcl|ACC}}\" and {{lang|ja|\u307e\u308a\u3092}} ''mari o'' \"ball {{gcl|ACC}}\" would be realized as {{IPA|/hoNno/}}, {{IPA|/kakjo/}} and {{IPA|/majo/}} ( \u2190 {{IPA|/ma\u027djo/}}) in most of northern and central Kagoshima, and {{IPA|/hoNnu/}}, {{IPA|/kakju/~/kaku/}} and {{IPA|/maju/}} ( \u2190 {{IPA|/ma\u027dju/}}) in parts of Kagoshima's southern mainland.<ref>Shibatani (1990), p. 210</ref>\n\nResyllabification has also led to the reanalysis of some particles in a few dialects. For instance, the topic particle ''(w)a'' has been completely superseded by the form ''na'' in [[Izumi, Kagoshima|Izumi]],<ref name=\"Izumi\">{{cite web | url=http://sky.geocities.jp/ryohusyokyoryu/izumigo.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234707/http://sky.geocities.jp/ryohusyokyoryu/izumigo.html | archivedate=2013-12-02 | script-title=ja:\u5317\u85a9\u51fa\u6c34\u8a9e\u3092\u8a71\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046\uff01 | language=Japanese |trans-title=Let's learn the Hokusatsu district Izumi dialect! | accessdate=2012-04-22}}</ref> which in most mainland dialects is merely a variant of ''(w)a'' after a moraic nasal.\n\n== Resyllabification rules ==\n\nWhen a word is followed by a particle that starts with a vowel (such as the topic particle {{lang|ja|\u306f}} ''a'', the accusative particle {{lang|ja|\u3092}} ''o'' or the dative particle {{lang|ja|\u3044}} ''i''), the final syllable of that word will be fused with the particle and be subject to Kagoshima's [[kagoshima dialect#Coalescence|vowel coalescence rules]] as well as other sound changes occurring in the regional dialect. As a simple example, when the word {{lang|ja|\u3053\u308c}} {{IPA|/ko\u027de/}} ''kore'' \"this\" is followed by the topic particle {{lang|ja|\u306f}} {{IPA|/a/}}, it becomes {{lang|ja|\u3053\u308a\u3083}} {{IPA|/ko\u027dja/}} ''korya'' \"this={{gcl|TOP}}\". A secondary sound change in Mainland Kagoshima then causes the medial {{IPA|/\u027dj/}} ''ry'' to become {{IPA|/j/}} ''y'', giving the common form {{lang|ja|\u3053\u3084}} {{IPA|/koja/}} ''koya'' \"this={{gcl|TOP}}\".\n\nTwo main exceptions to this rule exist:\n\n# If a word's underlying form ends in a moraic nasal (i.e. {{IPA|/N/}}), an [[Epenthesis|epenthetic]] {{IPA|/n/}} is inserted between the word and the particle. For example, {{lang|ja|\u672c}} {{IPA|/hoN/}} ''hon'' \"book\" becomes {{lang|ja|\u672c\u306f}} {{IPA|/hoNna/}} ''honna'' when fused with the topic particle.\n# If a word's underlying form ends in a long vowel or sequence of vowels, then an epenthetic consonant is sometimes inserted between the word and the topic particle. In the case of topic particle {{lang|ja|\u306f}} ''a'' and the accusative particle {{lang|ja|\u3092}} ''o'', the epenthetic consonant is {{IPA|/w/}}. In the case of the dative particle {{lang|ja|\u3044}} ''i'', the epenthetic consonant is {{IPA|/n/}}.

Pa decides to move his family away before they can be forced to leave.\n\n==Historical background==\nThe Ingalls moved from Wisconsin to Kansas in 1868 (stopping for a while in [[Rothville, Missouri]]), and lived there between 1869 and 1870. [[Carrie Ingalls|Carrie]] was born there in August, and a few weeks after her birth, they were forced to leave the territory (however, in the novel, she is present during the move to Kansas). They moved back to Wisconsin, where they lived the next four years. In 1874 they started for [[Walnut Grove, Minnesota]], stopping for a while in [[Lake City, Minnesota|Lake City]].\n\nAlthough Wilder states that Charles had been told that the Kansas territory would soon be up for settlement, their homestead was on the Osage Indian reservation and Charles' information was incorrect. The Ingalls had no legal right to occupy their homestead, and once informed of their error, left the territory despite the fact that they had only just begun farming it. Several of their neighbors stayed and fought the decision.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kaye |first=Frances W. |title=Little Squatter on the Osage Diminished Reserve: Reading Laura Ingalls Wilder's Kansas Indians |journal=Great Plains Quarterly |volume=20 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=123\u2013140 |doi= |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=greatplainsquarterly }}</ref>\n\nAs they were preparing to leave, the Ingalls received word from Wisconsin that the man who purchased their farm near Pepin had defaulted on the mortgage.
