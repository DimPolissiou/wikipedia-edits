Ryan's ''[[Tumbleweeds (comic strip)|Tumbleweeds]]'', Jim Davis created the comic strip ''[[Gnorm Gnat]]'', which ran only in the ''Pendleton Times'' of [[Pendleton, Indiana]] from 1972 to 1975 and met with little success. One editor famously said \"[Davis'] art was good, his gags were great, [but] nobody can identify with bugs.\"<ref name=\"Twenty\"/>\n\nDavis decided to take a long, hard look at current comic strips to determine what species of animal star characters might be more popular. He felt that dogs were doing well, but noticed no prominent cats. Davis figured he could create a cat star, having grown up on a farm with twenty-five cats. Thus was created the character of Garfield.<ref name=\"Twenty\">Davis. ''20 Years & Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection''. p. 14.</ref>\n\nGarfield, the star, was based on the cats Davis grew up around; he took his name and personality from Davis' grandfather, James A.

Towa Chiki made ''[[A Week of Garfield]]'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]], released only in Japan in 1989. [[Sega]] also made video games based on Garfield for the Genesis (''[[Garfield: Caught in the Act]]'') and Windows 3.1 computers. Other companies made games, such as ''[[Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties (video game)|A Tale of Two Kitties]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS|DS]], published by Game Factory, ''[[Garfield's Nightmare]]'' for DS, ''Garfield's Funfest'' for DS, and ''[[Garfield Labyrinth]]'' for [[Game Boy]]. On PlayStation 2 were ''Garfield'' and ''Garfield 2'' (known in the US as ''Garfield, a Tale of Two Kitties''). ''Garfield Lasagna World Tour'' was also made for PS2. And recent additions for mobile devices are \"Garfield's Diner\" and \"Garfield's Zombie Defense\".\n\n[[Konami]] also released a Garfield ''[[Handheld electronic game]]'' titled ''[[Lasagnator]]'' in 1991, which met with mild success.\n\nIn 2012, a series of Garfield video games was launched by French publisher [[Anuman Interactive]], including ''My Puzzles with Garfield!'', ''Multiplication Tables with Garfield'', ''Garfield Kart'', and ''Garfield's Match Up''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Farrugia|first=Nathan|url=http://www.capsulecomputers.com.au/2013/10/garfield-kart-new-details-and-pictures/|title=Garfield Kart New Details and Pictures \u2013 Capsule Computers|publisher=Capsulecomputers.com.au|date=|access-date=2018-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812130505/http://www.capsulecomputers.com.au/2013/10/garfield-kart-new-details-and-pictures/|archive-date=August 12, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Stage===\n[[Joseph Papp]], producer of ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', discussed making a Garfield stage musical, but due to some complications, it never got off ground.

The book was written by Jim Davis, with music and lyrics by Michael Dansicker and Bill Meade, and it was booked by AWA Touring Services.

The restaurant has been described by its founder and \"Chief Entergage Officer\" Nathen Mazri as a \"quick mobile restaurant\". Mazri claims that the restaurant is \"entergaging\", a [[portmanteau]] of the words \"entertaining\" and \"engaging\". Customers order food through the official mobile app, which also contains games and allows users to purchase episodes of ''Garfield and Friends''. The restaurant serves lasagna, Garfield-shaped pizza, \"[[Cappuccino|Garfuccinos]]\", and Garfield-shaped dark chocolate bars.

He is known for saying \"breathing is exercise\".\n\nThough Garfield can be very cynical, he does have a soft side for his teddy bear, Pooky, food and sleep, and in one Christmas he says, \"they say I have to get up early, be nice to people, skip breakfast ... I wish it would never end.\"\nHowever, in the feature film ''[[Garfield Gets Real]]'' and its sequels, Garfield is better behaved, friendlier towards Jon and Odie, less self-centered, and more sympathetic.\n\nIt has been wondered by many readers if Garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him. Sometimes, it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned in more than one strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904152923/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 4, 2014|title=Garfield|date=August 15, 2009|publisher=Gocomics.com|access-date=July 8, 2011}}</ref> However, in the feature film [[Garfield Gets Real]] and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals save for Odie are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans.

The appearance in 1979 claimed it to be his first birthday, although in the first appearance of the strip (June 19, 1978), he was portrayed as a fully-grown cat, implying that the birthday is of the strip itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics|title=Garfield Comics|date=February 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Jon Arbuckle===\n'''First appearance: June 19, 1978'''\n\n{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' Here's my sixth-grade report card.

Arbuckle)]] is Garfield's owner, usually depicted as an awkward clumsy [[geek]] who has trouble finding a date. Jon had a crush on Liz (Garfield's veterinarian) and is now dating her. Jon disapproves of Garfield's \"don't care, not interested\", attitude, and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him, sometimes stating an interesting fact, or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt Garfield into thought, Garfield tends to brush this off with a simple, yet logical remark, and despite the trouble Garfield causes, Jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of Garfield's shortcomings, a fact which Garfield often takes advantage of. In the December 23, 1980 strip, Jon states that he is thirty years old (nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties, although he has not aged physically). His birthday is July 28.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808190758/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2016|title=Garfield|date=July 28, 2005|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808210333/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2016|title=Garfield|date=July 28, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJon loves (or occasionally hates) Garfield and all cats. Many gags focus on this; his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills, his poor taste in clothes (Garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that \"two hundred moths committed suicide\";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2002/ga020110.gif|title=Garfield|date=January 10, 2002|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref> in another, the \"geek police\" ordered Jon to \"throw out his tie\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1989/ga890811.gif|title=Garfield|date=August 11, 1989|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref> and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with \"[[polka]] [[ninja]]s\". Other strips portray him as lacking intelligence (he is seen reading a [[pop-up book]] in one strip).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1990/ga900324.gif|title=Garfield|date=March 24, 1990|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nJon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities; in one strip, his father, upon seeing indoor plumbing, remarks, \"Woo-ha! Ain't science something?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga841127.gif|title=Garfield|date=November 27, 1984|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref> Jon occasionally visits his parents, brother and grandmother at their farm. It was implied that Jon is inspired by a drawing of Davis himself when he was first drawing the strip. Jon was portrayed as a [[cartoonist]] in the first strip<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1978/06/19|title=Garfield by Jim Davis for June 19, 1978 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Davis|first=Jim|date=1978-06-19|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref> and occasional others in the early years; Davis stated his intent had been to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist. Ultimately, Jon's job has been referenced far more frequently in Garfield animated series than in the strip.\n\n===Odie===\n'''First appearance: August 8, 1978'''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|work=Garfield.com|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga780808.gif|date=August 8, 1978|access-date=August 7, 2006}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' I think I'm having some kind of identity crisis.\n\n''Garfield, walking past Odie who is lying in a kitchen drawer:'' He thinks '''he's''' having an identity crisis ...

He was originally owned by Jon's friend [[List of characters in Garfield#Lyman|Lyman]], though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book ''Garfield: His 9 Lives'' (1984) [[retcons]] Odie's origin: there is no mention of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten). Odie is younger than Garfield and usually portrayed as na\u00efve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading ''[[War and Peace]]'' and watching ''An Evening With Mozart'' on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1989/ga890427.gif|title=Garfield|date=April 27, 1989|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref> Odie has only talked once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon's [[sudoku]] puzzle.\n\n===Dr. Liz Wilson===\n'''First appearance: June 26, 1979'''\n\n{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' Tell me, Liz, haven't we met somewhere before? A rice paddy in Hong Kong?\n\n''Liz:'' Look, jerk. I'll be the vet for your cat, but I won't play [[fall guy]] for your stupid lines. Understood?\n\n''Jon, shocked:'' Uh-huh.

She has a somewhat deadpan, sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to Jon's outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion. Jon often attempted to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeded; however, in an extended story arc from June 19 to July 29, 2006 (the main event on July 28), Liz and Jon kiss, and have been a couple ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&addr=060728|title=Garfield's Comic Strip Archives at Garfield.com \u2013 The Official Web Site of Garfield & Friends|publisher=Garfield.com|date=|access-date=2012-09-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072545/http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&addr=060728|archive-date=July 11, 2011|df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Recurring subjects and themes==\nMany of the gags focus on Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and any form of exertion; his constant shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon as well as his obsession with mailing Nermal to [[Abu Dhabi]], or simply throwing him ''through'' the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of [[raisin]]s and [[spinach]]), Garfield is particularly fond of [[lasagna]]; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish). He also has odd relationships with household pests; Garfield generally spares mice, and even cooperates with them to cause mischief (much to Jon's chagrin), but will readily swat or pound spiders flat. Other gags focus on Jon's poor social skills and inability to get a date; before he started dating Liz, he often tried to get dates, usually without success (in one strip, after failing to get a date with \"Nancy\", he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother; he ended up getting \"shot down by three generations\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1996/ga960614.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=June 14, 1996|access-date=August 5, 2008}}</ref> When he does get a date, it usually goes awry; Jon's dates have slashed his tires, been tranquilized, and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears. The storylines featuring Jon's dates rarely appear now. Before, he had dates with many odd characters, whereas now, he exclusively dates Liz.\n\nGarfield's world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, a place he loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food is the center of most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his [[tractor]] (which he [[double parking|double-parked]]) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon takes Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to.<ref name=\"The Garfield Vault Strip\">{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2007/ga070819.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=August 19, 2007|access-date=June 6, 2008|work=Garfield.com}}</ref> Frequently, the characters break the [[fourth wall]], mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1992/ga920125.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=January 25, 1992|access-date=June 21, 2008|work=Garfield.com}}</ref> or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting that his thoughts are stuffed up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga781127.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=November 27, 1978|access-date=June 21, 2008|work=Garfield.com}}</ref>\n\n===Short storylines===\nOne particular semi-recurring storyline features Jon and Liz on a date in a restaurant. They sometimes are waited on by the Italian Armando, who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards Jon, presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery. On other occasions, the couple receives a different waiter, such as a large ogre-like man who intimidates Jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food.\n\nAnother commonly recurring character, although hardly ever seen, is Jon's neighbor, Mrs. Feeny. Garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her, to the point the she even erects an electric fence (which of course, does not stop him).\n\nOther unique themes are things like \"Garfield's Believe it or Don't\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's Believe it, or DON'T|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+Believe+it%2C+or+DON%27T%21|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712032111/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+Believe+it,+or+DON'T!|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 12, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=April 15, 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|author-link=Jim Davis (cartoonist)|date=January 20, 1986}}</ref> \"Garfield's Law\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's law|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+law|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710084143/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+law|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 10, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=15 April 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|author-link=|date=November 8, 1982}}</ref> \"Garfield's History of Dogs\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield Comic Strips September 1980|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708094750/http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 8, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=15 April 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|author-link=|date=September 1, 1980}}</ref> and \"Garfield's History of Cats\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's history of cats garfield.nfshost.com :: search garfield|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+history+of+cats|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709072827/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+history+of+cats|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 9, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=April 15, 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|date=August 6, 1979}}</ref> which show science, history, and the world from Garfield's point of view.

Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very nearsighted) old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year's Eve. Most of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon's attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is \"Splut Week\", when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield's history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia \"splut\", hence the name.\n\nEvery week before June 19, the strip focuses on Garfield's birthday, which he dreads because of his fear of getting older. This started happening after his sixth birthday. However, before his 29th birthday, Liz put Garfield on a diet. On June 19, 2007, Garfield was given the greatest birthday present: \"I'M OFF MY DIET!\" Occasionally the strip celebrates Halloween as well with scary-themed jokes, such as mask gags. There are also seasonal jokes, with snow-related gags common in January or February and beach- or heat-themed jokes in the summer.\n\n[[File:Garfield 1989-10-27 right panel.png|frame|Right panel of October 27, 1989 strip.]]\n\nOne storyline, which ran the week before [[Halloween]] in 1989, is unique among Garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/its-not-just-you-garfield-is-not-meant-to-be-funny-6199556/|title=It's Not Just You: Garfield Is Not Meant to Be Funny|date=20 March 2013|access-date=29 April 2018|magazine=Smithsonian Magazine|last=Eveleth|first=Rose}}{{Failed verification|date=June 2019}}</ref> It depicts Garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists. In Garfield's ''Twentieth Anniversary Collection'', in which the strips are reprinted, Jim Davis discusses the genesis for this series:\n\n{{quote|During a writing session for Halloween, I got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips. I wanted to scare people. And what do people fear most? Why, being alone. We carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers. Reaction ranged from 'Right on!' to 'This isn't a trend, is it?'}}\n\nOne of the recurring storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest one of these lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off \u2013 and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, [[monkey]]s, a [[Pinniped|seal]], a snake, a [[kangaroo]] and [[joey (marsupial)|joey]], and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.\n\nAnother story involved Jon going away on a business trip around Christmas time, leaving Garfield a week's worth of food, which he devoured instantly. Garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out. He then reunites with his mother, and eventually makes it back home in the snow on Christmas Eve (December 3\u201323, 1984). Part of this storyline was taken from the 1983 Emmy-winning special ''[[Garfield on the Town]]''.\n\n===Paws, Inc.===\nPaws, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.send2press.com/PRnetwire/pr04_101203-nypaws.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020045311/http://www.send2press.com/PRnetwire/pr04_101203-nypaws.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 20, 2004|title=Running Paws, Inc. \u2013 The Evolution of Dog Walking Reaches 100th Client \u2013 Business News from Send2Press Newswire 10/12/04|publisher=Send2press.com|date=2004-10-12|access-date=2010-01-10|df=mdy-all}}</ref> was founded in 1981 by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] to support the Garfield comic strip and its licensing.

Garfield is also shown to manipulate people to get whatever he wants.

In addition to the various merchandise and commercial tie-ins, the strip has spawned several animated television specials, two animated television series, two theatrical feature-length live-action/CGI animated films, and three fully CGI animated direct-to-video movies.\n\nPart of the strip's broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of [[social commentary|social]] or [[political commentary#Political cartoons|political]] commentary; though this was Davis's original intention, he also admitted that his \"grasp of politics isn't strong\", joking that, for many years, he thought \"[[OPEC]] was a [[dental bonding|denture adhesive]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,283648,00.html|title=Tales of the Kitty|first=Beth|last=Johnson|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=August 4, 2008|date=June 19, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2005/11/5/movies/12462084&sec=movies|title=Everybody loves Garfield|work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|access-date=August 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn August 6, 2019, New York City-based [[ViacomCBS]] announced that it would acquire [[Paws, Inc.]], including the rights to the ''Garfield'' franchise (the comics, merchandise and animated cartoons).

Ryan's ''[[Tumbleweeds (comic strip)|Tumbleweeds]]'', Jim Davis created the comic strip ''[[Gnorm Gnat]]'', which ran only in the ''Pendleton Times'' of [[Pendleton, Indiana]] from 1972 to 1975 and met with little success. One editor famously said \"[Davis'] art was good, his gags were great, [but] nobody can identify with bugs.\"<ref name=\"Twenty\"/>\n\nDavis decided to take a long, hard look at current comic strips to determine what species of animal star characters might be more popular. He felt that dogs were doing well, but noticed no prominent cats. Davis figured he could create a cat star, having grown up on a farm with twenty-five cats. Thus was created the character of Garfield.<ref name=\"Twenty\">Davis. ''20 Years & Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection''. p. 14.</ref>\n\nGarfield, the star, was based on the cats Davis grew up around; he took his name and personality from Davis' grandfather, James A.

I wish it would never end.\"\nHowever, in the feature film ''[[Garfield Gets Real]]'' and its sequels, Garfield is better behaved, friendlier towards Jon and Odie, less self-centered, and more sympathetic.\n\nIt has been wondered by many readers if Garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him. Sometimes, it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned in more than one strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904152923/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 4, 2014|title=Garfield|date=August 15, 2009|publisher=Gocomics.com|access-date=July 8, 2011}}</ref> However, in the feature film [[Garfield Gets Real]] and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals save for Odie are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans.

The appearance in 1979 claimed it to be his first birthday, although in the first appearance of the strip (June 19, 1978), he was portrayed as a fully-grown cat, implying that the birthday is of the strip itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics|title=Garfield Comics|date=February 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Jon Arbuckle===\n'''First appearance: June 19, 1978'''\n\n{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' Here's my sixth-grade report card.

Arbuckle)]] is Garfield's owner, usually depicted as an awkward clumsy [[geek]] who has trouble finding a date. Jon had a crush on Liz (Garfield's veterinarian) and is now dating her. Jon disapproves of Garfield's \"don't care, not interested\", attitude, and often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him, sometimes stating an interesting fact, or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt Garfield into thought, Garfield tends to brush this off with a simple, yet logical remark, and despite the trouble Garfield causes, Jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of Garfield's shortcomings, a fact which Garfield often takes advantage of. In the December 23, 1980 strip, Jon states that he is thirty years old (nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties, although he has not aged physically). His birthday is July 28.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808190758/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2016|title=Garfield|date=July 28, 2005|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808210333/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 8, 2016|title=Garfield|date=July 28, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJon loves (or occasionally hates) Garfield and all cats. Many gags focus on this; his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills, his poor taste in clothes (Garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that \"two hundred moths committed suicide\";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2002/ga020110.gif|title=Garfield|date=January 10, 2002|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref> in another, the \"geek police\" ordered Jon to \"throw out his tie\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1989/ga890811.gif|title=Garfield|date=August 11, 1989|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref> and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with \"[[polka]] [[ninja]]s\". Other strips portray him as lacking intelligence (he is seen reading a [[pop-up book]] in one strip).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1990/ga900324.gif|title=Garfield|date=March 24, 1990|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\nJon was born on a farm that apparently contained few amenities; in one strip, his father, upon seeing indoor plumbing, remarks, \"Woo-ha! Ain't science something?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga841127.gif|title=Garfield|date=November 27, 1984|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref> Jon occasionally visits his parents, brother and grandmother at their farm. It was implied that Jon is inspired by a drawing of Davis himself when he was first drawing the strip. Jon was portrayed as a [[cartoonist]] in the first strip<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1978/06/19|title=Garfield by Jim Davis for June 19, 1978 {{!}} GoComics.com|last=Davis|first=Jim|date=1978-06-19|website=GoComics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref> and occasional others in the early years; Davis stated his intent had been to express his own frustrations as a cartoonist. Ultimately, Jon's job has been referenced far more frequently in Garfield animated series than in the strip.\n\n===Odie===\n'''First appearance: August 8, 1978'''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|work=Garfield.com|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga780808.gif|date=August 8, 1978|access-date=August 7, 2006}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' I think I'm having some kind of identity crisis.\n\n''Garfield, walking past Odie who is lying in a kitchen drawer:'' He thinks '''he's''' having an identity crisis ...

He was originally owned by Jon's friend [[List of characters in Garfield#Lyman|Lyman]], though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book ''Garfield: His 9 Lives'' (1984) [[retcons]] Odie's origin: there is no mention of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten). Odie is younger than Garfield and usually portrayed as na\u00efve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading ''[[War and Peace]]'' and watching ''An Evening With Mozart'' on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1989/ga890427.gif|title=Garfield|date=April 27, 1989|publisher=Garfield.com|access-date=July 26, 2008}}</ref> Odie has only talked once. In another strip, published on January 28, 2010, he is seen solving Jon's [[sudoku]] puzzle.\n\n===Dr. Liz Wilson===\n'''First appearance: June 26, 1979'''\n\n{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' Tell me, Liz, haven't we met somewhere before?

She has a somewhat deadpan, sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to Jon's outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion. Jon often attempted to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeded; however, in an extended story arc from June 19 to July 29, 2006 (the main event on July 28), Liz and Jon kiss, and have been a couple ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&addr=060728|title=Garfield's Comic Strip Archives at Garfield.com \u2013 The Official Web Site of Garfield & Friends|publisher=Garfield.com|date=|access-date=2012-09-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072545/http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&addr=060728|archive-date=July 11, 2011|df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Recurring subjects and themes==\nMany of the gags focus on Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and any form of exertion; his constant shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon as well as his obsession with mailing Nermal to [[Abu Dhabi]], or simply throwing him ''through'' the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of [[raisin]]s and [[spinach]]), Garfield is particularly fond of [[lasagna]]; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish). He also has odd relationships with household pests; Garfield generally spares mice, and even cooperates with them to cause mischief (much to Jon's chagrin), but will readily swat or pound spiders flat. Other gags focus on Jon's poor social skills and inability to get a date; before he started dating Liz, he often tried to get dates, usually without success (in one strip, after failing to get a date with \"Nancy\", he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother; he ended up getting \"shot down by three generations\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1996/ga960614.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=June 14, 1996|access-date=August 5, 2008}}</ref> When he does get a date, it usually goes awry; Jon's dates have slashed his tires, been tranquilized, and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears. The storylines featuring Jon's dates rarely appear now. Before, he had dates with many odd characters, whereas now, he exclusively dates Liz.\n\nGarfield's world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, a place he loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food is the center of most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his [[tractor]] (which he [[double parking|double-parked]]) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon takes Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to.<ref name=\"The Garfield Vault Strip\">{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2007/ga070819.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=August 19, 2007|access-date=June 6, 2008|work=Garfield.com}}</ref> Frequently, the characters break the [[fourth wall]], mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1992/ga920125.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=January 25, 1992|access-date=June 21, 2008|work=Garfield.com}}</ref> or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting that his thoughts are stuffed up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1978/ga781127.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=November 27, 1978|access-date=June 21, 2008|work=Garfield.com}}</ref>\n\n===Short storylines===\nOne particular semi-recurring storyline features Jon and Liz on a date in a restaurant. They sometimes are waited on by the Italian Armando, who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards Jon, presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery. On other occasions, the couple receives a different waiter, such as a large ogre-like man who intimidates Jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food.\n\nAnother commonly recurring character, although hardly ever seen, is Jon's neighbor, Mrs. Feeny. Garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her, to the point the she even erects an electric fence (which of course, does not stop him).\n\nOther unique themes are things like \"Garfield's Believe it or Don't\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's Believe it, or DON'T|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+Believe+it%2C+or+DON%27T%21|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712032111/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+Believe+it,+or+DON'T!|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 12, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=April 15, 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|author-link=Jim Davis (cartoonist)|date=January 20, 1986}}</ref> \"Garfield's Law\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's law|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+law|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710084143/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+law|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 10, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=15 April 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|author-link=|date=November 8, 1982}}</ref> \"Garfield's History of Dogs\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield Comic Strips September 1980|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708094750/http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 8, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=15 April 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|author-link=|date=September 1, 1980}}</ref> and \"Garfield's History of Cats\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's history of cats garfield.nfshost.com :: search garfield|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+history+of+cats|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709072827/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+history+of+cats|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 9, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|access-date=April 15, 2012|last=Davis|first=Jim|date=August 6, 1979}}</ref> which show science, history, and the world from Garfield's point of view. Another particular theme is \"National Fat Week\", where Garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people. Also, there was a storyline involving Garfield catching Odie eating his food and \"kicking Odie into next week\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840629.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=June 29, 1984|access-date=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}</ref> Soon, Garfield realizes that \"Lunch isn't the same without Odie. He always slips up behind me, barks loudly and makes me fall into my food\" (Garfield subsequently falls into his food by himself).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840630.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=June 30, 1984|access-date=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}</ref> A few days after the storyline began, Garfield is lying in his bed with a \"nagging feeling I'm forgetting something\", with Odie landing on Garfield in the next panel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840702.gif|title=The Garfield Vault Strip|date=July 2, 1984|access-date=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}</ref> Jon and Liz began to go out more frequently, Jon has started hiring pet sitters to look after Garfield and Odie, though they do not always work out. Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very nearsighted) old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year's Eve. Most of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon's attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is \"Splut Week\", when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield's history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia \"splut\", hence the name.\n\nEvery week before June 19, the strip focuses on Garfield's birthday, which he dreads because of his fear of getting older. This started happening after his sixth birthday. However, before his 29th birthday, Liz put Garfield on a diet. On June 19, 2007, Garfield was given the greatest birthday present: \"I'M OFF MY DIET!\" Occasionally the strip celebrates Halloween as well with scary-themed jokes, such as mask gags. There are also seasonal jokes, with snow-related gags common in January or February and beach- or heat-themed jokes in the summer.\n\n[[File:Garfield 1989-10-27 right panel.png|frame|Right panel of October 27, 1989 strip.]]\n\nOne storyline, which ran the week before [[Halloween]] in 1989, is unique among Garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/its-not-just-you-garfield-is-not-meant-to-be-funny-6199556/|title=It's Not Just You: Garfield Is Not Meant to Be Funny|date=20 March 2013|access-date=29 April 2018|magazine=Smithsonian Magazine|last=Eveleth|first=Rose}}{{Failed verification|date=June 2019}}</ref> It depicts Garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists. In Garfield's ''Twentieth Anniversary Collection'', in which the strips are reprinted, Jim Davis discusses the genesis for this series:\n\n{{quote|During a writing session for Halloween, I got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips. I wanted to scare people. And what do people fear most? Why, being alone. We carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers. Reaction ranged from 'Right on!' to 'This isn't a trend, is it?'}}\n\nOne of the recurring storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest one of these lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off \u2013 and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, [[monkey]]s, a [[Pinniped|seal]], a snake, a [[kangaroo]] and [[joey (marsupial)|joey]], and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.\n\nAnother story involved Jon going away on a business trip around Christmas time, leaving Garfield a week's worth of food, which he devoured instantly. Garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out. He then reunites with his mother, and eventually makes it back home in the snow on Christmas Eve (December 3\u201323, 1984). Part of this storyline was taken from the 1983 Emmy-winning special ''[[Garfield on the Town]]''.\n\n===Paws, Inc.===\nPaws, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.send2press.com/PRnetwire/pr04_101203-nypaws.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020045311/http://www.send2press.com/PRnetwire/pr04_101203-nypaws.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 20, 2004|title=Running Paws, Inc. \u2013 The Evolution of Dog Walking Reaches 100th Client \u2013 Business News from Send2Press Newswire 10/12/04|publisher=Send2press.com|date=2004-10-12|access-date=2010-01-10|df=mdy-all}}</ref> was founded in 1981 by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] to support the Garfield comic strip and its licensing.

It is located {{convert|33|mi}} southeast of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].\n\nThe city began as a center of [[crude oil]] production, was later propelled by [[citrus]] production, and is now an important retail center because of the large [[Brea Mall]] and the recently redeveloped Brea Downtown. Brea is also known for its extensive public art program which began in 1975 and continues today with over 140 artworks in the collection placed and located throughout the city. Brea's public art program has been used as a model and inspiration for many public art programs across the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==History==\nThe area was visited on July 29, 1769 by the Spanish [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]] &ndash; the first Europeans to see inland parts of [[Alta California]].

In 1894, the owner of the land, [[Abel Stearns]], sold {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} to the west of Olinda to the newly created [[Unocal Corporation|Union Oil Company of California]], and by 1898 many nearby hills began sporting wooden oil-drilling towers on the newly discovered [[Brea-Olinda Oil Field]].  In 1908 the village of '''Randolph''', named for railway engineer [[Epes Randolph]], was founded just south of Brea Canyon for the oil workers and their families.  Baseball legend [[Walter Johnson]] grew up in Olinda at the start of the 20th century where he worked in the surrounding [[oil fields]] as a youth.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dufresne |first=Chris |title=The year the Big Train stopped in Brea, and brought the Babe |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 2, 2008 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/orange/la-sp-breababe2-2008jun02,0,3088387.story?page=2 |accessdate=June 2, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe villages of Olinda and Randolph grew and merged as the economy boomed, and on January 19, 1911, the town's map was filed under the new name of '''Brea''', from the Spanish language word for [[asphalt|natural asphalt (also called bitumen, pitch or tar)]]. With a population of 752, Brea was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] on February 23, 1917, as the eighth official city of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].\n\nAs oil production declined, some agricultural development took place, especially lemon and orange groves. In the 1920s, the Brea [[Chamber of Commerce]] promoted the city with the slogan \u201cOil, Oranges, and Opportunity.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=Brea Chamber History|publisher=Brea Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.breachamber.com/pages/BreaChamberHistory|access-date=September 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914031201/http://www.breachamber.com/pages/BreaChamberHistory|archive-date=September 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1950 Brea had a population of 3,208. The citrus groves gave way gradually to industrial parks and residential development. In 1956, [[Carl N. Karcher]] opened the first two Carl's Jr. restaurants in [[Anaheim, California]] and Brea, California. The opening of the [[Orange Freeway]] (57) and the [[Brea Mall]] in the 1970s spurred further residential growth, including large planned developments east of the 57 Freeway in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. In the late 1990s, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} swath of downtown Brea centered on Brea Boulevard and Birch Street was heavily redeveloped into a shopping and entertainment area with movie theaters, sidewalk cafes, a live comedy club from [[The Improv]] chain, numerous shops and restaurants, and a weekly farmer's market.

California|Orange County]], California. The population as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] was 39,282. It is located {{convert|33|mi}} southeast of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].\n\nThe city began as a center of [[crude oil]] production, was later propelled by [[citrus]] production, and is now an important retail center because of the large [[Brea Mall]] and the recently redeveloped Brea Downtown. Brea is also known for its extensive public art program which began in 1975 and continues today with over 140 artworks in the collection placed and located throughout the city. Brea's public art program has been used as a model and inspiration for many public art programs across the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==History==\nThe area was visited on July 29, 1769 by the Spanish [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]] &ndash; the first Europeans to see inland parts of [[Alta California]]. The party camped in Brea Canyon, near a large native village and a small pool of clean water.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bolton |first=Herbert E. |pages=142\u2013143 |year=1927 |title=Fray Juan Crespi: Missionary Explorer on the Pacific Coast, 1769-1774 |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000288788 |location= |publisher=HathiTrust Digital Library}}</ref> A historical marker dedicated to his visit stands in Brea Canyon just north of town.\n\n[[Image:Brea-oilfields1900s.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Oil fields]] of the Brea area, early 1900s]]The [[Olinda Village|village of '''Olinda''']] was founded in present-day Carbon Canyon at the beginning of the 19th century and many entrepreneurs came to the area searching for \"black gold\" (petroleum). In 1894, the owner of the land, [[Abel Stearns]], sold {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} to the west of Olinda to the newly created [[Unocal Corporation|Union Oil Company of California]], and by 1898 many nearby hills began sporting wooden oil-drilling towers on the newly discovered [[Brea-Olinda Oil Field]].  In 1908 the village of '''Randolph''', named for railway engineer [[Epes Randolph]], was founded just south of Brea Canyon for the oil workers and their families.  Baseball legend [[Walter Johnson]] grew up in Olinda at the start of the 20th century where he worked in the surrounding [[oil fields]] as a youth.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dufresne |first=Chris |title=The year the Big Train stopped in Brea, and brought the Babe |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 2, 2008 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/orange/la-sp-breababe2-2008jun02,0,3088387.story?page=2 |accessdate=June 2, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe villages of Olinda and Randolph grew and merged as the economy boomed, and on January 19, 1911, the town's map was filed under the new name of '''Brea''', from the Spanish language word for [[asphalt|natural asphalt (also called bitumen, pitch or tar)]]. With a population of 752, Brea was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] on February 23, 1917, as the eighth official city of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].\n\nAs oil production declined, some agricultural development took place, especially lemon and orange groves. In the 1920s, the Brea [[Chamber of Commerce]] promoted the city with the slogan \u201cOil, Oranges, and Opportunity.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=Brea Chamber History|publisher=Brea Chamber of Commerce|url=http://www.breachamber.com/pages/BreaChamberHistory|access-date=September 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914031201/http://www.breachamber.com/pages/BreaChamberHistory|archive-date=September 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1950 Brea had a population of 3,208. The citrus groves gave way gradually to industrial parks and residential development. In 1956, [[Carl N. Karcher]] opened the first two Carl's Jr. restaurants in [[Anaheim, California]] and Brea, California. The opening of the [[Orange Freeway]] (57) and the [[Brea Mall]] in the 1970s spurred further residential growth, including large planned developments east of the 57 Freeway in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. In the late 1990s, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} swath of downtown Brea centered on Brea Boulevard and Birch Street was heavily redeveloped into a shopping and entertainment area with movie theaters, sidewalk cafes, a live comedy club from [[The Improv]] chain, numerous shops and restaurants, and a weekly farmer's market. It is locally known and signed as Downtown Brea.\n\n''[[Sunset (magazine)|Sunset]]'' magazine named Brea one of the five best suburbs to live in the Western United States in early 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://breadowntown.com/bdt-new.htm |title=Brea Wins Acclaim, Best Place To Live |work=[[Sunset (magazine)|Sunset]] |accessdate=August 5, 2007 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120701180553/http://breadowntown.com/bdt-new.htm |archive-date=July 1, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|12.1|sqmi|km2}}. {{convert|12.1|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and 0.26% is water.\n\nIt is bordered by unincorporated [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] to the north and east, [[La Habra, California|La Habra]] to the west, [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] to the southwest, [[Placentia, California|Placentia]] to the south, and [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]] to the southeast.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] system, Brea has a [[Mediterranean climate#Hot-summer Mediterranean climate|hot-summer Mediterranean climate]], abbreviated \"Csa\" on climate maps.<ref name=Weatherbase>{{cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=650141&cityname=Brea-California-United-States-of-America |title=Brea, California Travel Weather Averages (Weatherbase) |work=Weatherbase |accessdate=August 13, 2016}}</ref>\n{{Weather box\n|location = Brea, California\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = No\n|Jan high F = 69\n|Feb high F = 70\n|Mar high F = 72\n|Apr high F = 74\n|May high F = 76\n|Jun high F = 80\n|Jul high F = 85\n|Aug high F = 86\n|Sep high F = 86\n|Oct high F = 81\n|Nov high F = 75\n|Dec high F = 69\n|Jan low F = 47\n|Feb low F = 48\n|Mar low F = 50\n|Apr low F = 52\n|May low F = 57\n|Jun low F = 60\n|Jul low F = 64\n|Aug low F = 64\n|Sep low F = 62\n|Oct low F = 57\n|Nov low F = 51\n|Dec low F = 46\n|Jan precipitation inch = 2.5\n|Feb precipitation inch = 3.1\n|Mar precipitation inch = 2.7\n|Apr precipitation inch = 1.1\n|May precipitation inch = 0.2\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.4\n|Sep precipitation inch = 0.3\n|Oct precipitation inch = 0.3\n|Nov precipitation inch = 1.2\n|Dec precipitation inch = 2.4\n|date=March 2019\n}}\n\n==Government==\n[[Image:Brea cityhall-external.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Brea City Hall, Civic & Cultural Center]]\n\n===Local===\nBrea is governed by a [[council-manager]] system.

However, their marksmanship was very poor, quality and supply of powder and shot dreadful, maintenance non-existent and attitude towards firearms summed up in the observation that: \"The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms \u2013 the arms of a coward, as they said, for they enable the [[:wikt:poltroon|poltroon]] to kill the brave without awaiting his attack.\"<ref>Bourquin, S..''Military History Journal, V. 4, No. 4, The Zulu Military Organization'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, Dec. 1978</ref> The British had timed the invasion to coincide with the harvest, intending to catch the Zulu warrior-farmers dispersed. Fortuitously for Cetshwayo, the Zulu army had already begun to assemble at Ulundi, as it did every year for the ''[[Umkhosi Wokweshwama|First Fruits]]'' ceremony when all warriors were duty-bound to report to their regimental barracks near Ulundi.<ref>Lock, p. 82</ref><ref name=c294>Colenso, p. 294</ref>\n\nCetshwayo sent the 24,000 strong main Zulu impi from near present-day Ulundi, on 17 January, across the [[White Umfolozi River]] with the following command to his warriors: \"March slowly, attack at dawn and eat up the red soldiers.\"<ref>Lock, p. 86</ref>\n\nOn 18 January, some 4,000 warriors were detached from the main body to attack [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]]'s No. 1 Column near [[Eshowe]]. The remaining 20,000 Zulus camped at the isiPhezi ikhanda. The next day, the main force arrived and camped near [[Babanango|Babanango Mountain]], then moved the next day to a camp near Siphezi Mountain. Finally, on 21 January they moved into the Ngwebeni Valley, where they remained concealed, planning to attack the British on 23 January, but they were discovered by a scouting party on 22 January. Under the command of Ntshigwayo kaMahole the Zulu army had reached its position in easy stages. It marched in two columns within sight of each other, but a few miles apart to prevent a surprise attack. They were preceded by a screening force of mounted scouts supported by parties of warriors 200-400 strong tasked with preventing the main columns from being sighted.<ref>Lock, pp. 129\u201331</ref> The speed of the Zulu advance compared to the British was marked. The Zulu impi had advanced over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} in five days, while Chelmsford had only advanced slightly over {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 10 days.<ref>Lock, pp. 87, 129\u201330</ref>\n\nThe British under Chelmsford pitched camp at [[Isandlwana]] on 20 January,<ref name=\"NHoSA-166\"/> but did not follow standing orders to entrench. No [[laager]] (circling of the wagons) was formed. Chelmsford did not see the need for one, stating, \"It would take a week to make.\"<ref name=c294/> But the chief reason for the failure to take defensive precautions appears to have been that the British command severely underestimated the Zulus' capabilities. The experience of numerous colonial wars fought in Africa was that the massed firepower of relatively small bodies of professional European troops, armed with modern firearms and artillery and supplemented by local allies and levies, would march out to meet the natives whose poorly equipped armies would put up a fight but in the end would succumb. Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with [[Martini\u2013Henry]] [[rifle]]s, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as [[Brown Bess]] [[musket]]s. Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied Chelmsford's thoughts. Rather than any fear that the camp might be attacked, his main concern was managing the huge number of wagons and oxen required to support his forward advance.<ref>Colenso, pp. 264\u201366, 273\u201375</ref>\n\nOnce he had established the camp at Isandlwana, Chelmsford sent out two battalions of the Natal Native Contingent to scout ahead. They skirmished with elements of a Zulu force which he believed to be the vanguard of the main enemy army. Such was the confidence in British military training and firepower that he divided his force, taking about 3,400 men, including half of the British infantry contingent, and set out to find the main Zulu force with the intention of bringing them to battle, so as to achieve a decisive victory. It never occurred to him that the Zulus he saw were diverting him from their main force.<ref>Lock, p. 151</ref>\n\nChelmsford left behind five companies, around 80 fighting men in each, of the 1st Battalion and one stronger company of around 150 men from the 2nd Battalion of the 24th to guard the camp, under the command of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry Pulleine]]. Pulleine's orders were to defend the camp and wait for further instructions to support the general as and when called upon. Pulleine also had around 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and approximately 200 local mounted irregulars. He also had two artillery pieces, with around 70 men of the Royal Artillery. In total, some 1,300 men and two artillery guns of the No. 3 Column were left to defend the camp.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 36</ref><ref>https://www.historyhit.com/facts-about-the-battle-of-isandlwana/</ref>\n[[File:LL1882 pg279 ZULU SOLDIERS AND KRAAL.jpg|thumb|Zulu warriors, 1882]]\nPulleine, left in command of a rear position, was an administrator with no experience of front-line command on a campaign. Nevertheless, he commanded a strong force, particularly the six veteran regular infantry companies, which were experienced in colonial warfare. The mounted vedettes, cavalry scouts, patrolling some {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} from camp reported at 7:00 am that groups of Zulus, numbering around 4,000 men, could be seen. Further reports arrived to Pulleine during the early morning, each reporting movements, both large and small, of Zulus. There was speculation among the officers whether these troops were intending to march against Chelmsford's rear or towards the camp itself.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\">Knight (1992, 2002), p. 40</ref>\n\nAround 10:30 am, [[Colonel]] [[Anthony Durnford]], whose left arm was paralyzed from the Xhosa War, arrived from [[Rorke's Drift]] with 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and a rocket battery of the No. 2 Column to reinforce the camp at Isandlwana. This brought the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior and by tradition should have assumed command.<ref>Pulleine's rank was brevet lieutenant colonel; in other words he was still being paid as a major.</ref> However, he did not over-rule Pulleine's dispositions and after lunch he quickly decided to take to the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford's rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\"/>\n\nChelmsford had underestimated the disciplined, well-led, well-motivated and confident Zulus. The failure to secure an effective defensive position, the poor intelligence on the location of the main Zulu army, Chelmsford's decision to split his force in half, and the Zulus' tactical exploitation of the terrain and the weaknesses in the British formation, all combined to prove catastrophic for the troops at Isandlwana. In contrast, the Zulus responded to the unexpected discovery of their camp with an immediate and spontaneous advance. Even though the [[induna]]s would lose control over the advance, the warriors' training allowed the Zulu troops to form their standard attack formation on the run, their battle line deployed in reverse of its intended order.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 41</ref><ref>Colenso, p. 409</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Dabulamanzi.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]]]]\n\nThe Zulu Army was  commanded by ''ESA'' (Princes) [[Ntshingwayo Khoza|Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza]] and Mavumengwana kaNdlela Ntuli. The ''inDuna'' [[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]], half brother of Cetshwayo, would command the Undi Corps after [[Zibhebhu kaMaphitha]], the regular ''inkhosi'', or commander, was wounded.<ref name=morris/>\n\nWhile Chelmsford was in the field seeking them, the entire Zulu army had outmanoeuvred him, moving behind his force with the intention of attacking the British Army on the 23rd. Pulleine had received reports of large forces of Zulus throughout the morning of the 22nd from 8:00am on. [[Vedette (sentry)|Vedettes]] had observed Zulus on the hills to the left front, and Lt. Chard, while he was at the camp, observed a large force of several thousand Zulu moving to the British left around the hill of Isandlwana. Pulleine sent word to Chelmsford, which was received by the General between 9:00am and 10:00am.<ref>Colenso, pp. 287, 288</ref> The main Zulu force was discovered at around 11:00am by men of Lt. Charles Raw's troop of scouts, who chased a number of Zulus into a valley, only then seeing most of the 20,000 men of the main enemy force sitting in total quiet. This valley has generally been thought to be the [[Ngwebeni]] some {{convert|7|mi|km}} from the British camp but may have been closer in the area of the spurs of Nqutu hill. Having been discovered, the Zulu force leapt to the offensive. Raw's men began a [[Withdrawal (military)|fighting retreat]] back to the camp and a messenger was sent to warn Pulleine.\n\nThe Zulu attack then developed in the traditional horns and chest of the buffalo, with the aim of encircling the British position. From Pulleine's vantage point in the camp, at first only the right horn and then the chest (centre) of the attack seemed to be developing. Pulleine sent out first one, then all six companies of the 24th Foot into an extended firing line, with the aim of meeting the Zulu attack head-on and checking it with firepower. Durnford's men, upon meeting elements of the Zulu centre, had retreated to a [[donga (ditch)|donga]], a dried-out watercourse, on the British right flank where they formed a defensive line. The Rocket Battery under Durnford's command, which was not mounted and dropped behind the rest of the force, was isolated and overrun very early in the engagement. The two battalions of native troops were in Durnford's line; while all the officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] carried rifles, only one in 10 in the ranks was armed with a muzzle-loading musket with limited ammunition<ref name=\"Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B\">Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B</ref><ref>Thompson, pp. 17, 22. About 20% of each battalion had some sort of firearm</ref> and many of them started to leave the battlefield at this point.<ref>Morris, p. 371.</ref>\n\nPulleine only made one change to the original disposition after about 20 minutes of firing, bringing in the companies in the firing line slightly closer to the camp. For an hour or so<ref>Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B gives a start time for the battle of around 8:00 am with the Zulus falling back behind the hills until noon and the final Zulu advance beginning at 1:00 pm</ref> until after noon, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting many casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The [[Martini\u2013Henry]] rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the [[Royal Artillery]] forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.<ref>Morris, p. 373; Colenso, p. 285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Battle of Isandlwana ([[Charles Edwin Fripp]])]]\n\nDurnford's men, who had been fighting the longest, began to withdraw and their [[rate of fire]] diminished. Durnford's withdrawal exposed the right flank of the British regulars, which, with the general threat of the Zulu encirclement, caused Pulleine to order a withdrawal back to the camp. The regulars' retreat was performed with order and discipline and the men of the 24th conducted a fighting withdrawal into the camp. Durnford's retreat, however, exposed the flank of G Company, 2nd/24th, which was overrun relatively quickly.<ref>Morris, pp. 373\u201374.</ref>\n\nAn officer in advance from Chelmsford's force gave this eyewitness account of the final stage of the battle at about 3:00 pm:\n\n{{quote|In a few seconds we distinctly saw the guns fired again, one after the other, sharp.

Evidence shows that many of the bodies, today marked by [[cairn]]s, were found in several large groups around the camp \u2013 including one stand of around 150 men.

The fighting had been [[hand-to-hand combat]] and [[no quarter]] was given to the British regulars.

Further, they successfully concealed the advance and location of this force until they were within a few hours' striking distance of their enemy. The British made no such efforts. Finally, when the location of the main Zulu Impi was discovered by British scouts, the Zulus, without hesitation, immediately advanced and attacked, achieving tactical surprise.<ref>Doyle, pp. 126\u201327</ref> This tactical surprise prevented the British, although they now had some warning of a Zulu advance, from concentrating their central column. It also left little time and gave scant information for Pulleine to organise a sufficient defence for his command. The Zulus had outmanoeuvred Chelmsford, and their victory at Isandlwana was a decisive defeat<ref>Lock, p. 225, \"That an awesome defeat had taken place was clear&nbsp;...\". Also, Laband, John. ''Historical Dictionary of the Zulu Wars'', Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8108-6078-3}}, p. 5, \"...&nbsp;the main Zulu army outmaneuvered, divided and annihilated the British No. 3 column at Isandlwana.\",  Knight, Ian and Hook, Adam.

Laband, p. 6, \"Chelmsford launched his 2nd invasion&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\nRecent historians, notably Lock and Quantrill in ''Zulu Victory'', argue that from the Zulu perspective the [[theatre of operations]] included the diversions around [[Magogo]] Hills and Mangeni Falls and that these diversions, which drew more than half of Chelmsford's forces away from Isandlwana, were deliberate.<ref>Lock, p. 230.</ref> Also, the main Zulu force was not unexpectedly discovered in their encampment but was fully deployed and ready to advance on the British camp. These historians' view of the expanded battlefield considers Chelmsford to be the overall commander of the British forces, and that responsibility for the defeat lies firmly with him.\n\n===British perspective===\n[[File:Isandlwanazulumem.JPG|right|thumb|[[Memorial]] erected at the site commemorating the valour of the fallen Zulu [[impi]] at Isandlwana Hill, which is visible in the background<ref>Doyle, p. 131.

Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, as opposed to the [[military strategy|strategic]] lapses and failings in [[grand tactics]] on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for mistakes that may have led directly to the British defeat.\n\n====British tactical failings====\n* The initial view, reported by [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]], was that the British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough.  The box lids were screwed down, the screws were rusty and difficult to remove, there were too few screwdrivers, \"standing orders\" insisted that until a box was empty, no other boxes were to be opened, and  the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10\u201312 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution.<ref>{{cite web |first=Horace |last=Smith-Dorrien |url=http://www.richthofen.com/smith-dorrien/dorrien01b.htm |title=Memories of Forty-Eight Years' Service |publisher=Richthofen.com}}</ref> Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest in a letter to his father.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n* Donald Morris in ''[[The Washing of the Spears]]'' argues that the men, fighting too far from the camp, ran out of ammunition, starting first with Durnford's men who were holding the right flank and who had been in action longer, which precipitated a slowdown in the rate of fire against the Zulus. This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the firing line and that the seventy rounds each man took to the firing line were not sufficient.<ref name=morris>Morris</ref><ref>Laband, p. 4.</ref>\n* A different view, supported with evidence from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt. Colonel Snook's works, (the latter having written ''How Can Man Die Better?''), suggests that, although Durnford's men probably did run out of ammunition, the majority of men in the firing line did not. The discovery of the British line so far out from the camp has led Ian Knight to conclude that the British were defending too large a perimeter.<ref>Snook, Mike. ''How Can Man Die Better: The Secrets of Isandlwana Revealed''. London: Greenhill Books, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-85367-656-7}}</ref>\n* The official interrogation by Horse Guards under the direction of the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], the Field Marshal Commanding in Chief, in August 1879, concluded that the primary cause of the defeat was the \"under estimate formed of the offensive fighting power of the Zulu army\", additionally the investigation questions Chelmsford as to why the camp was not [[laagered]] and why there was a failure to reconnoitre and discover the nearby Zulu army.<ref>Lock, pp. 280\u201381. Doyle, p. 120.</ref>\n* Colenso calls Chelmsford's neglecting to follow his own \"Regulations for Field Forces in South Africa\", which required that a defensible camp be established at every halt, fatal.<ref>Colenso, p. 274.</ref>\n\n====British command failings====\nNumerous messages, some quite early in the day, had been sent to Chelmsford informing him, initially, of the presence of the Zulu near the camp and, subsequently, of the attack on the camp, with increasingly urgent pleas for help. The most egregious failure to respond occurred at around 1:30 pm when a message from [[George Hamilton-Browne|Hamilton-Browne]] stating, \"For God's sake come back, the camp is surrounded, and things I fear are going badly\", was received by Lieutenant-Colonel Harness of the Royal Artillery and Major Black of the 2/24. They were leading the other four RA guns as well as two companies of the 2/24 and on their own initiative immediately marched back towards Isandlwana and had gone some two miles when they were ordered to return to Mangeni Falls by an aide sent by Chelmsford.<ref>Lock pp. 214\u201315, 252.</ref>\n\nAt long last but too late, finally Chelmsford became convinced of the seriousness of the situation on his left flank and rear when at 3:30pm he joined Hamilton-Browne's NNC and realised the camp had been taken. A surviving officer, Rupert Lonsdale, rode up and described the camp's fall to which Chelmsford replied, \"But I left over 1,000 men to guard the camp\".<ref>Lock, p. 225.</ref> He quickly gathered his scattered forces and marched the column back to Isandlwana but arrived at sundown long after the battle ended and the Zulu army had marched off. The British camped on the field that night but left before sunrise without any examination of the ground as Chelmsford felt that it would demoralize his troops. The column then proceeded to [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]]\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Impact===\n[[File:Garnet Wolseley.jpg|thumb|[[Field Marshal]] [[Garnet Wolseley|Lord Wolseley]]]]\nThough Isandlwana was a disaster for the British, the Zulu victory did not end the war. With the decisive defeat of Chelmsford's central column, the entire invasion of Zululand collapsed and would have to be restaged. Not only were there heavy manpower casualties to the Main Column, but most of the supplies, ammunition and draught animals were lost.<ref>Knight (2002), p. 89</ref> As King Cetshwayo feared, the embarrassment of the defeat would force the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulus. Despite local numerical superiority, the Zulus did not have the manpower, technological resources, or logistical capacity to match the British in another, more extended, campaign.<ref>Shillington, Kevin. ''Encyclopedia of African history'', Volume 1, 2005, {{ISBN|1-57958-245-1}}, p. 71, \"...&nbsp;need to tend to cattle and crops&nbsp;...\". Colenso, pp. 294\u201395; Knight, Ian and McBride, Angus. ''Zulu 1816\u20131906'', p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Zulus may have missed an opportunity to exploit their victory and possibly win the war that day on their own territory. The reconnaissance force under Chelmsford was more vulnerable to being defeated by an attack than the camp. It was strung out and somewhat scattered, it had marched with limited rations and ammunition it could not now replace, and it was panicky and demoralized by the defeat at Isandlwana.<ref>Thompson, pp. 47, 63, 75</ref>\n\nNear the end of the battle, about 4,000 Zulu warriors of the unengaged reserve Undi impi, after cutting off the retreat of the survivors to the Buffalo River southwest of Isandlwana, crossed the river and attacked the fortified mission station at [[Rorke's Drift]]. The station was defended by only 140 British soldiers, who nonetheless inflicted considerable casualties and repelled the attack. Elsewhere, the left and right flanks of the invading forces were now isolated and without support. The No. 1 column under the command of [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]] would be besieged for two months by a Zulu force at [[Eshowe]], while the No. 4 column under [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]] halted its advance and spent most of the next two months skirmishing in the northwest around Tinta's Kraal.<ref>Lock, pp. 284\u201385</ref><ref>Knight (2002), p. 90</ref>\n\nFollowing Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, the British and Colonials were in complete panic over the possibility of a counter invasion of Natal by the Zulus.<ref>Colenso, pp. 308\u201311. Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere,'' Vol. ii.,  London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> All the towns of Natal 'laagered' up and fortified and provisions and stores laid in.<ref>Knight, Ian. ''Zulu War 1879'', Osprey Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84176-612-7}}, p. 40.</ref> Bartle Frere stoked the fear of invasion despite the fact that, aside from Rorke's Drift, the Zulus made no attempt to cross the border. Immediately following the battle, Zulu Prince Ndanbuko urged them to advance and take the war into the colony but they were restrained by a commander, kaNthati, reminding them of Cetshwayo's prohibiting the crossing the border.<ref name=k86/> Unknown to the inhabitants of Natal, Cetshwayo, still hoping to avoid outright war, had prohibited any crossing of the border in retaliation and was incensed over the violation of the border by the attack on Rorke's Drift.<ref>Colenso, p. 311, \"the Zulus who in the flush of victory crossed into Natal at Rorke's Drift&nbsp;... were called back with the words, 'Against the orders of your king!' \"</ref>\n\nThe British government's reasoning for a new invasion was threefold. The first was [[jingoistic]] to a degree and national honor demanded that the enemy, victors in one battle, should lose the war.<ref>Knight (2003), p. 8, \"Imperial pride ensured that the government in London would have to support British troops in the field, at least until military supremacy had been achieved.\". Colenso, p. 416, \"...&nbsp;the which was to 'wipe out' the disaster of Isandhlawana moved up to the front.\"</ref> The second concerned the domestic political implications at the next parliamentary elections.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\">Knight (2003), p. 67</ref> However, despite the new invasion, the [[Prime Minister of the UK|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] were to lose the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 election]]. Finally, there were considerations affecting the Empire: unless the British were seen to win a clear-cut victory against the Zulus, it would send a signal that the [[British Empire]] was vulnerable and that the defeat of a British field army could alter policy.<ref>Morris, p. 446,</ref> If the Zulu victory at Isandlwana encouraged resistance elsewhere in the Empire,<ref>Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere'', Vol. ii., Chapter xix, London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> then committing the resources necessary to defeat the Zulus would, in the long term, prove cheaper than fighting wars that the Zulu success inspired against British [[Imperialism]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\"/><ref>Colenso, p. 474, \"A considerable number of Boers who had never willingly accepted the annexation of their country by the English, had taken the opportunity&nbsp;... after the disaster of 22 January&nbsp;... to regain their independence&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\nAfter Isandlwana, the British field army was heavily reinforced and again invaded Zululand. Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent to take command and relieve Chelmsford, as well as Bartle Frere. Chelmsford, however, avoided handing over command to Wolseley and managed to defeat the Zulus in a number of engagements, the last of which was the [[Battle of Ulundi]], followed by capture of King Cetshwayo. With the fall of the Disraeli government, Bartle Frere was recalled in August 1880 and the policy of Confederation was abandoned.<ref>Knight ''Zulu War 1879'' p. 68.</ref> The British encouraged the subkings of the Zulus to rule their subkingdoms without acknowledging a central Zulu power. By the time King Cetshwayo was allowed to return home, there was no longer an independent Zulu kingdom.<ref>Lock, pp. 287\u201389</ref>\n\nThe measure of respect that the British gained for their opponents as a result of Isandlwana can be seen in that in none of the other engagements of the Zulu War did the British attempt to fight again in their typical [[Line (formation)|linear formation]], known famously as [[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|the Thin Red Line]], in an open-field battle with the main Zulu impi. In the battles that followed, the British, when facing the Zulu, entrenched themselves or formed very close-order formations, such as the  [[Infantry square|square]].<ref>Hall, D.D..''Military History Journal, V.4, No.5, Squares in the Zulu War 1879'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, June 1979.

He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would hardly have been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as it was meant to be temporary.\n\nWolseley wrote on 30 September 1879 when, later in the war, the [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Imperial of France]] was killed by the Zulu: \"I think this is very unfair, and is merely a repetition of what was done regarding the Isandlwana disaster where the blame was thrown upon Durnford, the real object in both instances being apparently to screen Chelmsford.\"<ref>Lock, p. 300</ref>\n\nLater, Chelmsford launched a new and successful campaign in Zululand, routing the Zulu army, capturing the Royal Kraal of Ulundi, and thus partially retrieving his reputation. He never held another field command.\n\nFollowing the war and his return to the UK, Chelmsford sought an audience with [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], who had become Prime Minister in April 1880, but his request was refused, a very public slight and a clear sign of official disapproval. Chelmsford, however, obtained an audience with [[Queen Victoria]] to personally explain the events. She asked Gladstone to meet Chelmsford; this meeting was brief, and during it Gladstone voiced his displeasure.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bambatha Rebellion]]\n* [[Battle of Adwa]]\n* [[Battle of Blood River]]\n* [[Battle of Rorke's Drift]]\n* [[British military history]]\n* [[Colony of Natal]]\n* [[List of Zulu War Victoria Cross recipients]]\n* [[Martini\u2013Henry]]\n* [[Military history of South Africa]]\n* [[Natal Native Contingent]]\n* ''[[Zulu Dawn]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Colenso|first1=Frances |author2=assisted in those portions of the work that touch on military matters by Lieut.-Colonel Edward Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and Its Origin|location=London|publisher=Chapman and Hall|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich|isbn=1-152-31729-6|archive-date=18 June 2007|url-status=live|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Fz1CAAAAIAAJ}}\n* {{cite book|editor1-last=Doyle|editor1-first= Peter|editor2-last= Bennett|editor2-first= Matthew R.|title=Fields of Battle|publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers|year= 2002|isbn=1-4020-0433-8|first=Tony|last= Pollard|chapter=The Mountain is their Monument|pp=118\u2013}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.

Lord Chelmsford settled on three invading columns with the main centre column, now consisting of some 7,800 men comprising the previously called No. 3 Column, commanded by the Colonel of the 24th Richard Glynn, and Durnford's No. 2 Column,<ref>Colenso, pp. 263\u201364 gives 7,800: 1752 Imperial and Colonial troops and 6,054 Native Contingent and 377 Conductors and Drivers for the No. 2 Column under Durnford and the No. 3 Column under Glynn which made up Chelmsford's Main Column.

He moved his troops from [[Pietermaritzburg]] to a forward camp at Helpmekaar, past [[Greytown (KwaZulu-Natal)|Greytown]]. On 9 January 1879 they moved to [[Rorke's Drift]], and early on 11 January commenced crossing the [[Buffalo River (KwaZulu-Natal)|Buffalo River]] into [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]].<ref name=\"NHoSA-166\">{{cite book|first1=Hermann|last1=Giliomee|first2=Bernard|last2=Mbenga|title=New History of South Africa|publisher=Tafelberg Publishers |year=2007|edition=First|page=166|isbn=978-0-624-04359-1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Military Map of Zulu Land.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|British Army \"Military Map of Zulu Land\", 1879.

Some Zulus also had old muskets and antiquated rifles stockpiled, a relatively few<ref name=\"Horace Smith-Dorrien 1925\"/> of which were carried by Zulu [[impi]]. However, their marksmanship was very poor, quality and supply of powder and shot dreadful, maintenance non-existent and attitude towards firearms summed up in the observation that: \"The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms \u2013 the arms of a coward, as they said, for they enable the [[:wikt:poltroon|poltroon]] to kill the brave without awaiting his attack.\"<ref>Bourquin, S..''Military History Journal, V. 4, No. 4, The Zulu Military Organization'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, Dec. 1978</ref> The British had timed the invasion to coincide with the harvest, intending to catch the Zulu warrior-farmers dispersed. Fortuitously for Cetshwayo, the Zulu army had already begun to assemble at Ulundi, as it did every year for the ''[[Umkhosi Wokweshwama|First Fruits]]'' ceremony when all warriors were duty-bound to report to their regimental barracks near Ulundi.<ref>Lock, p. 82</ref><ref name=c294>Colenso, p. 294</ref>\n\nCetshwayo sent the 24,000 strong main Zulu impi from near present-day Ulundi, on 17 January, across the [[White Umfolozi River]] with the following command to his warriors: \"March slowly, attack at dawn and eat up the red soldiers.\"<ref>Lock, p. 86</ref>\n\nOn 18 January, some 4,000 warriors were detached from the main body to attack [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]]'s No. 1 Column near [[Eshowe]]. The remaining 20,000 Zulus camped at the isiPhezi ikhanda. The next day, the main force arrived and camped near [[Babanango|Babanango Mountain]], then moved the next day to a camp near Siphezi Mountain. Finally, on 21 January they moved into the Ngwebeni Valley, where they remained concealed, planning to attack the British on 23 January, but they were discovered by a scouting party on 22 January. Under the command of Ntshigwayo kaMahole the Zulu army had reached its position in easy stages. It marched in two columns within sight of each other, but a few miles apart to prevent a surprise attack. They were preceded by a screening force of mounted scouts supported by parties of warriors 200-400 strong tasked with preventing the main columns from being sighted.<ref>Lock, pp. 129\u201331</ref> The speed of the Zulu advance compared to the British was marked. The Zulu impi had advanced over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} in five days, while Chelmsford had only advanced slightly over {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 10 days.<ref>Lock, pp. 87, 129\u201330</ref>\n\nThe British under Chelmsford pitched camp at [[Isandlwana]] on 20 January,<ref name=\"NHoSA-166\"/> but did not follow standing orders to entrench. No [[laager]] (circling of the wagons) was formed. Chelmsford did not see the need for one, stating, \"It would take a week to make.\"<ref name=c294/> But the chief reason for the failure to take defensive precautions appears to have been that the British command severely underestimated the Zulus' capabilities. The experience of numerous colonial wars fought in Africa was that the massed firepower of relatively small bodies of professional European troops, armed with modern firearms and artillery and supplemented by local allies and levies, would march out to meet the natives whose poorly equipped armies would put up a fight but in the end would succumb. Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with [[Martini\u2013Henry]] [[rifle]]s, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as [[Brown Bess]] [[musket]]s. Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied Chelmsford's thoughts. Rather than any fear that the camp might be attacked, his main concern was managing the huge number of wagons and oxen required to support his forward advance.<ref>Colenso, pp. 264\u201366, 273\u201375</ref>\n\nOnce he had established the camp at Isandlwana, Chelmsford sent out two battalions of the Natal Native Contingent to scout ahead. They skirmished with elements of a Zulu force which he believed to be the vanguard of the main enemy army. Such was the confidence in British military training and firepower that he divided his force, taking about 3,400 men, including half of the British infantry contingent, and set out to find the main Zulu force with the intention of bringing them to battle, so as to achieve a decisive victory. It never occurred to him that the Zulus he saw were diverting him from their main force.<ref>Lock, p. 151</ref>\n\nChelmsford left behind five companies, around 80 fighting men in each, of the 1st Battalion and one stronger company of around 150 men from the 2nd Battalion of the 24th to guard the camp, under the command of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry Pulleine]]. Pulleine's orders were to defend the camp and wait for further instructions to support the general as and when called upon. Pulleine also had around 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and approximately 200 local mounted irregulars. He also had two artillery pieces, with around 70 men of the Royal Artillery. In total, some 1,300 men and two guns of the No. 3 Column were left to defend the camp.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 36</ref><ref>https://www.historyhit.com/facts-about-the-battle-of-isandlwana/</ref>\n[[File:LL1882 pg279 ZULU SOLDIERS AND KRAAL.jpg|thumb|Zulu warriors, 1882]]\nPulleine, left in command of a rear position, was an administrator with no experience of front-line command on a campaign. Nevertheless, he commanded a strong force, particularly the six veteran regular infantry companies, which were experienced in colonial warfare. The mounted vedettes, cavalry scouts, patrolling some {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} from camp reported at 7:00 am that groups of Zulus, numbering around 4,000 men, could be seen. Further reports arrived to Pulleine during the early morning, each reporting movements, both large and small, of Zulus. There was speculation among the officers whether these troops were intending to march against Chelmsford's rear or towards the camp itself.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\">Knight (1992, 2002), p. 40</ref>\n\nAround 10:30 am, [[Colonel]] [[Anthony Durnford]], whose left arm was paralyzed from the Xhosa War, arrived from [[Rorke's Drift]] with 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and a rocket battery of the No. 2 Column. This brought the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior and by tradition should have assumed command.<ref>Pulleine's rank was brevet lieutenant colonel; in other words he was still being paid as a major.</ref> However, he did not over-rule Pulleine's dispositions and after lunch he quickly decided to take to the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford's rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\"/>\n\nChelmsford had underestimated the disciplined, well-led, well-motivated and confident Zulus. The failure to secure an effective defensive position, the poor intelligence on the location of the main Zulu army, Chelmsford's decision to split his force in half, and the Zulus' tactical exploitation of the terrain and the weaknesses in the British formation, all combined to prove catastrophic for the troops at Isandlwana. In contrast, the Zulus responded to the unexpected discovery of their camp with an immediate and spontaneous advance. Even though the [[induna]]s would lose control over the advance, the warriors' training allowed the Zulu troops to form their standard attack formation on the run, their battle line deployed in reverse of its intended order.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 41</ref><ref>Colenso, p. 409</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Dabulamanzi.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]]]]\n\nThe Zulu Army was  commanded by ''ESA'' (Princes) [[Ntshingwayo Khoza|Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza]] and Mavumengwana kaNdlela Ntuli. The ''inDuna'' [[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]], half brother of Cetshwayo, would command the Undi Corps after [[Zibhebhu kaMaphitha]], the regular ''inkhosi'', or commander, was wounded.<ref name=morris/>\n\nWhile Chelmsford was in the field seeking them, the entire Zulu army had outmanoeuvred him, moving behind his force with the intention of attacking the British Army on the 23rd. Pulleine had received reports of large forces of Zulus throughout the morning of the 22nd from 8:00am on. [[Vedette (sentry)|Vedettes]] had observed Zulus on the hills to the left front, and Lt. Chard, while he was at the camp, observed a large force of several thousand Zulu moving to the British left around the hill of Isandlwana. Pulleine sent word to Chelmsford, which was received by the General between 9:00am and 10:00am.<ref>Colenso, pp. 287, 288</ref> The main Zulu force was discovered at around 11:00am by men of Lt. Charles Raw's troop of scouts, who chased a number of Zulus into a valley, only then seeing most of the 20,000 men of the main enemy force sitting in total quiet. This valley has generally been thought to be the [[Ngwebeni]] some {{convert|7|mi|km}} from the British camp but may have been closer in the area of the spurs of Nqutu hill. Having been discovered, the Zulu force leapt to the offensive. Raw's men began a [[Withdrawal (military)|fighting retreat]] back to the camp and a messenger was sent to warn Pulleine.\n\nThe Zulu attack then developed in the traditional horns and chest of the buffalo, with the aim of encircling the British position. From Pulleine's vantage point in the camp, at first only the right horn and then the chest (centre) of the attack seemed to be developing. Pulleine sent out first one, then all six companies of the 24th Foot into an extended firing line, with the aim of meeting the Zulu attack head-on and checking it with firepower. Durnford's men, upon meeting elements of the Zulu centre, had retreated to a [[donga (ditch)|donga]], a dried-out watercourse, on the British right flank where they formed a defensive line. The Rocket Battery under Durnford's command, which was not mounted and dropped behind the rest of the force, was isolated and overrun very early in the engagement. The two battalions of native troops were in Durnford's line; while all the officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] carried rifles, only one in 10 in the ranks was armed with a muzzle-loading musket with limited ammunition<ref name=\"Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B\">Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B</ref><ref>Thompson, pp. 17, 22. About 20% of each battalion had some sort of firearm</ref> and many of them started to leave the battlefield at this point.<ref>Morris, p. 371.</ref>\n\nPulleine only made one change to the original disposition after about 20 minutes of firing, bringing in the companies in the firing line slightly closer to the camp. For an hour or so<ref>Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B gives a start time for the battle of around 8:00 am with the Zulus falling back behind the hills until noon and the final Zulu advance beginning at 1:00 pm</ref> until after noon, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting many casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The [[Martini\u2013Henry]] rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the [[Royal Artillery]] forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.<ref>Morris, p. 373; Colenso, p. 285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Battle of Isandlwana ([[Charles Edwin Fripp]])]]\n\nDurnford's men, who had been fighting the longest, began to withdraw and their [[rate of fire]] diminished. Durnford's withdrawal exposed the right flank of the British regulars, which, with the general threat of the Zulu encirclement, caused Pulleine to order a withdrawal back to the camp. The regulars' retreat was performed with order and discipline and the men of the 24th conducted a fighting withdrawal into the camp. Durnford's retreat, however, exposed the flank of G Company, 2nd/24th, which was overrun relatively quickly.<ref>Morris, pp. 373\u201374.</ref>\n\nAn officer in advance from Chelmsford's force gave this eyewitness account of the final stage of the battle at about 3:00 pm:\n\n{{quote|In a few seconds we distinctly saw the guns fired again, one after the other, sharp.

Further, they successfully concealed the advance and location of this force until they were within a few hours' striking distance of their enemy. The British made no such efforts. Finally, when the location of the main Zulu Impi was discovered by British scouts, the Zulus, without hesitation, immediately advanced and attacked, achieving tactical surprise.<ref>Doyle, pp. 126\u201327</ref> This tactical surprise prevented the British, although they now had some warning of a Zulu advance, from concentrating their central column. It also left little time and gave scant information for Pulleine to organise a sufficient defence for his command. The Zulus had outmanoeuvred Chelmsford, and their victory at Isandlwana was a decisive defeat<ref>Lock, p. 225, \"That an awesome defeat had taken place was clear&nbsp;...\". Also, Laband, John.

Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, as opposed to the [[military strategy|strategic]] lapses and failings in [[grand tactics]] on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for mistakes that may have led directly to the British defeat.\n\n====British tactical failings====\n* The initial view, reported by [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]], was that the British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough.  The box lids were screwed down, the screws were rusty and difficult to remove, there were too few screwdrivers, \"standing orders\" insisted that until a box was empty, no other boxes were to be opened, and  the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10\u201312 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution.<ref>{{cite web |first=Horace |last=Smith-Dorrien |url=http://www.richthofen.com/smith-dorrien/dorrien01b.htm |title=Memories of Forty-Eight Years' Service |publisher=Richthofen.com}}</ref> Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest in a letter to his father.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n* Donald Morris in ''[[The Washing of the Spears]]'' argues that the men, fighting too far from the camp, ran out of ammunition, starting first with Durnford's men who were holding the right flank and who had been in action longer, which precipitated a slowdown in the rate of fire against the Zulus. This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the firing line and that the seventy rounds each man took to the firing line were not sufficient.<ref name=morris>Morris</ref><ref>Laband, p. 4.</ref>\n* A different view, supported with evidence from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt. Colonel Snook's works, (the latter having written ''How Can Man Die Better?''), suggests that, although Durnford's men probably did run out of ammunition, the majority of men in the firing line did not. The discovery of the British line so far out from the camp has led Ian Knight to conclude that the British were defending too large a perimeter.<ref>Snook, Mike. ''How Can Man Die Better: The Secrets of Isandlwana Revealed''. London: Greenhill Books, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-85367-656-7}}</ref>\n* The official interrogation by Horse Guards under the direction of the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], the Field Marshal Commanding in Chief, in August 1879, concluded that the primary cause of the defeat was the \"under estimate formed of the offensive fighting power of the Zulu army\", additionally the investigation questions Chelmsford as to why the camp was not [[laagered]] and why there was a failure to reconnoitre and discover the nearby Zulu army.<ref>Lock, pp. 280\u201381. Doyle, p. 120.</ref>\n* Colenso calls Chelmsford's neglecting to follow his own \"Regulations for Field Forces in South Africa\", which required that a defensible camp be established at every halt, fatal.<ref>Colenso, p. 274.</ref>\n\n====British command failings====\nNumerous messages, some quite early in the day, had been sent to Chelmsford informing him, initially, of the presence of the Zulu near the camp and, subsequently, of the attack on the camp, with increasingly urgent pleas for help. The most egregious failure to respond occurred at around 1:30 pm when a message from [[George Hamilton-Browne|Hamilton-Browne]] stating, \"For God's sake come back, the camp is surrounded, and things I fear are going badly\", was received by Lieutenant-Colonel Harness of the Royal Artillery and Major Black of the 2/24. They were leading the other four RA guns as well as two companies of the 2/24 and on their own initiative immediately marched back towards Isandlwana and had gone some two miles when they were ordered to return to Mangeni Falls by an aide sent by Chelmsford.<ref>Lock pp. 214\u201315, 252.</ref>\n\nAt long last but too late, finally Chelmsford became convinced of the seriousness of the situation on his left flank and rear when at 3:30pm he joined Hamilton-Browne's NNC and realised the camp had been taken. A surviving officer, Rupert Lonsdale, rode up and described the camp's fall to which Chelmsford replied, \"But I left over 1,000 men to guard the camp\".<ref>Lock, p. 225.</ref> He quickly gathered his scattered forces and marched the column back to Isandlwana but arrived at sundown long after the battle ended and the Zulu army had marched off. The British camped on the field that night but left before sunrise without any examination of the ground as Chelmsford felt that it would demoralize his troops. The column then proceeded to [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]]\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Impact===\n[[File:Garnet Wolseley.jpg|thumb|[[Field Marshal]] [[Garnet Wolseley|Lord Wolseley]]]]\nThough Isandlwana was a disaster for the British, the Zulu victory did not end the war. With the decisive defeat of Chelmsford's central column, the entire invasion of Zululand collapsed and would have to be restaged. Not only were there heavy manpower casualties to the Main Column, but most of the supplies, ammunition and draught animals were lost.<ref>Knight (2002), p. 89</ref> As King Cetshwayo feared, the embarrassment of the defeat would force the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulus. Despite local numerical superiority, the Zulus did not have the manpower, technological resources, or logistical capacity to match the British in another, more extended, campaign.<ref>Shillington, Kevin.

''Zulu 1816\u20131906'', p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Zulus may have missed an opportunity to exploit their victory and possibly win the war that day on their own territory. The reconnaissance force under Chelmsford was more vulnerable to being defeated by an attack than the camp. It was strung out and somewhat scattered, it had marched with limited rations and ammunition it could not now replace, and it was panicky and demoralized by the defeat at Isandlwana.<ref>Thompson, pp. 47, 63, 75</ref>\n\nNear the end of the battle, about 4,000 Zulu warriors of the unengaged reserve Undi impi, after cutting off the retreat of the survivors to the Buffalo River southwest of Isandlwana, crossed the river and attacked the fortified mission station at [[Rorke's Drift]]. The station was defended by only 140 British soldiers, who nonetheless inflicted considerable casualties and repelled the attack. Elsewhere, the left and right flanks of the invading forces were now isolated and without support. The No. 1 column under the command of [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]] would be besieged for two months by a Zulu force at [[Eshowe]], while the No. 4 column under [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]] halted its advance and spent most of the next two months skirmishing in the northwest around Tinta's Kraal.<ref>Lock, pp. 284\u201385</ref><ref>Knight (2002), p. 90</ref>\n\nFollowing Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, the British and Colonials were in complete panic over the possibility of a counter invasion of Natal by the Zulus.<ref>Colenso, pp. 308\u201311.

''Zulu War 1879'', Osprey Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84176-612-7}}, p. 40.</ref> Bartle Frere stoked the fear of invasion despite the fact that, aside from Rorke's Drift, the Zulus made no attempt to cross the border. Immediately following the battle, Zulu Prince Ndanbuko urged them to advance and take the war into the colony but they were restrained by a commander, kaNthati, reminding them of Cetshwayo's prohibiting the crossing the border.<ref name=k86/> Unknown to the inhabitants of Natal, Cetshwayo, still hoping to avoid outright war, had prohibited any crossing of the border in retaliation and was incensed over the violation of the border by the attack on Rorke's Drift.<ref>Colenso, p. 311, \"the Zulus who in the flush of victory crossed into Natal at Rorke's Drift&nbsp;... were called back with the words, 'Against the orders of your king!' \"</ref>\n\nThe British government's reasoning for a new invasion was threefold. The first was [[jingoistic]] to a degree and national honor demanded that the enemy, victors in one battle, should lose the war.<ref>Knight (2003), p. 8, \"Imperial pride ensured that the government in London would have to support British troops in the field, at least until military supremacy had been achieved.\". Colenso, p. 416, \"...&nbsp;the which was to 'wipe out' the disaster of Isandhlawana moved up to the front.\"</ref> The second concerned the domestic political implications at the next parliamentary elections.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\">Knight (2003), p. 67</ref> However, despite the new invasion, the [[Prime Minister of the UK|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] were to lose the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 election]]. Finally, there were considerations affecting the Empire: unless the British were seen to win a clear-cut victory against the Zulus, it would send a signal that the [[British Empire]] was vulnerable and that the defeat of a British field army could alter policy.<ref>Morris, p. 446,</ref> If the Zulu victory at Isandlwana encouraged resistance elsewhere in the Empire,<ref>Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere'', Vol. ii., Chapter xix, London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> then committing the resources necessary to defeat the Zulus would, in the long term, prove cheaper than fighting wars that the Zulu success inspired against British [[Imperialism]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\"/><ref>Colenso, p. 474, \"A considerable number of Boers who had never willingly accepted the annexation of their country by the English, had taken the opportunity&nbsp;... after the disaster of 22 January&nbsp;... to regain their independence&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\nAfter Isandlwana, the British field army was heavily reinforced and again invaded Zululand. Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent to take command and relieve Chelmsford, as well as Bartle Frere. Chelmsford, however, avoided handing over command to Wolseley and managed to defeat the Zulus in a number of engagements, the last of which was the [[Battle of Ulundi]], followed by capture of King Cetshwayo. With the fall of the Disraeli government, Bartle Frere was recalled in August 1880 and the policy of Confederation was abandoned.<ref>Knight ''Zulu War 1879'' p. 68.</ref> The British encouraged the subkings of the Zulus to rule their subkingdoms without acknowledging a central Zulu power. By the time King Cetshwayo was allowed to return home, there was no longer an independent Zulu kingdom.<ref>Lock, pp. 287\u201389</ref>\n\nThe measure of respect that the British gained for their opponents as a result of Isandlwana can be seen in that in none of the other engagements of the Zulu War did the British attempt to fight again in their typical [[Line (formation)|linear formation]], known famously as [[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|the Thin Red Line]], in an open-field battle with the main Zulu impi. In the battles that followed, the British, when facing the Zulu, entrenched themselves or formed very close-order formations, such as the  [[Infantry square|square]].<ref>Hall, D.D..''Military History Journal, V.4, No.5, Squares in the Zulu War 1879'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, June 1979. Details and diagrams of squares used by British</ref>\n\n===Recriminations===\n{{more citations needed|date = January 2013}}\nChelmsford realised that he would need to account to the government and to history for the disaster. He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would hardly have been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as it was meant to be temporary.\n\nWolseley wrote on 30 September 1879 when, later in the war, the [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Imperial of France]] was killed by the Zulu: \"I think this is very unfair, and is merely a repetition of what was done regarding the Isandlwana disaster where the blame was thrown upon Durnford, the real object in both instances being apparently to screen Chelmsford.\"<ref>Lock, p. 300</ref>\n\nLater, Chelmsford launched a new and successful campaign in Zululand, routing the Zulu army, capturing the Royal Kraal of Ulundi, and thus partially retrieving his reputation. He never held another field command.\n\nFollowing the war and his return to the UK, Chelmsford sought an audience with [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], who had become Prime Minister in April 1880, but his request was refused, a very public slight and a clear sign of official disapproval. Chelmsford, however, obtained an audience with [[Queen Victoria]] to personally explain the events. She asked Gladstone to meet Chelmsford; this meeting was brief, and during it Gladstone voiced his displeasure.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bambatha Rebellion]]\n* [[Battle of Adwa]]\n* [[Battle of Blood River]]\n* [[Battle of Rorke's Drift]]\n* [[British military history]]\n* [[Colony of Natal]]\n* [[List of Zulu War Victoria Cross recipients]]\n* [[Martini\u2013Henry]]\n* [[Military history of South Africa]]\n* [[Natal Native Contingent]]\n* ''[[Zulu Dawn]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Colenso|first1=Frances |author2=assisted in those portions of the work that touch on military matters by Lieut.-Colonel Edward Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and Its Origin|location=London|publisher=Chapman and Hall|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich|isbn=1-152-31729-6|archive-date=18 June 2007|url-status=live|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Fz1CAAAAIAAJ}}\n* {{cite book|editor1-last=Doyle|editor1-first= Peter|editor2-last= Bennett|editor2-first= Matthew R.|title=Fields of Battle|publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers|year= 2002|isbn=1-4020-0433-8|first=Tony|last= Pollard|chapter=The Mountain is their Monument|pp=118\u2013}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.

This followed the launches of the broadcasters' own video-on-demand services.\n\nOn Wednesday, 4 February 2009, Project Kangaroo was blocked by the [[Competition Commission]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/04/project-kangaroo-blocked-by-competition-commission|title=Project Kangaroo blocked by Competition Commission|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=2009-02-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> \n\nThe commission stated that the case surrounding Kangaroo was about the control of valuable UK-originated TV content. \"BBC Worldwide, ITV and Channel 4 together control the vast majority of this material, which puts them in a very strong position as wholesalers of TV content to restrict competition from other current and future providers of video-on-demand services to UK viewers,\" said Peter Freeman, the chairman of the Competition Commission, in its final report on Project Kangaroo. \"We thought viewers would benefit from better video-on-demand [VoD] services if the parties \u2013 possibly in conjunction with other new and/or already established providers of VoD \u2013 competed with each other.\"\n\nA Channel 4 spokesperson said at the time, \"This is a disproportionate remedy and a missed opportunity in the further development of British broadcasting.\"\n\nAfter the planned Project Kangaroo was blocked, the system's assets were sold to transmitter firm [[Arqiva]] and this led to the development of the service [[SeeSaw (Internet television)|SeeSaw]], which operated from February 2010 to October 2011, with content from the BBC, Channel 4, and Channel 5, some of which (such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'') now appears on BritBox.\n\n=== Entry of Netflix ===\nSince the arrival of [[Netflix]], European PSBs and Media companies have started to find ways to compete with American Subscription Video on Demand services (SVODs), and many old rivalries have also been put aside in Europe and to collaborate by creating joint SVODs, such the like of BritBox but also France's Salto (backed by networks [[TF1 Group|TF1]], [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]] and [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]]), and German-based [[:de:Joyn_(Streaminganbieter)|Joyn]] (a joint venture between [[ProSiebenSat.1 Media|ProSiebenSat.1]] and [[Discovery, Inc.|Discovery]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/european-broadcasters-unite-take-netflix-global-streamers-1217336|title=A European Union of TV?

This followed the launches of the broadcasters' own video-on-demand services.\n\nOn Wednesday, 4 February 2009, Project Kangaroo was blocked by the [[Competition Commission]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/04/project-kangaroo-blocked-by-competition-commission|title=Project Kangaroo blocked by Competition Commission|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=2009-02-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> \n\nThe commission stated that the case surrounding Kangaroo was about the control of valuable UK-originated TV content. \"BBC Worldwide, ITV and Channel 4 together control the vast majority of this material, which puts them in a very strong position as wholesalers of TV content to restrict competition from other current and future providers of video-on-demand services to UK viewers,\" said Peter Freeman, the chairman of the Competition Commission, in its final report on Project Kangaroo. \"We thought viewers would benefit from better video-on-demand [VoD] services if the parties \u2013 possibly in conjunction with other new and/or already established providers of VoD \u2013 competed with each other.\"\n\nA Channel 4 spokesperson said at the time, \"This is a disproportionate remedy and a missed opportunity in the further development of British broadcasting.\"\n\nAfter the planned Project Kangaroo was blocked, the system's assets were sold to transmitter firm [[Arqiva]] and this led to the development of the service [[SeeSaw (Internet television)|SeeSaw]], which operated from February 2010 to October 2011, with content from the BBC, Channel 4, and Channel 5, some of which (such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'') now appears on BritBox.\n\n=== Entry of Netflix ===\nSince the arrival of [[Netflix]], European PSBs and Media companies have started to find ways to compete with American Subscription Video on Demand services (SVODs), and many old rivalries have also been put aside in Europe and to collaborate by creating joint SVODs, such the like of BritBox but also France's Salto (backed by networks [[TF1 Group|TF1]], [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]] and [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]]), and German-based [[:de:Joyn_(Streaminganbieter)|Joyn]] (a joint venture between [[ProSiebenSat.1 Media|ProSiebenSat.1]] and [[Discovery, Inc.|Discovery]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/european-broadcasters-unite-take-netflix-global-streamers-1217336|title=A European Union of TV?

In the ''Doctor Who'' serial, people of Chinese extraction are termed \"inscrutable Chinks\" and an English actor performs in \"yellowface\". However, it is understood that no ''Fawlty Towers'' episodes will be cut from the service but will run with warnings of offensive language instead.
