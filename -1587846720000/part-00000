The group's core consisted of singer and guitarist Milan Mladenovi\u0107, keyboardist [[Margita Stefanovi\u0107]] and bassist [[Bojan Pe\u010dar]], with other members mostly remaining for comparatively shorter periods.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Post-punk years (1982\u20131986) ===\n====Katarina II====\nIn February 1982, following the disbandment of [[\u0160arlo Akrobata]], 24-year-old guitarist and vocalist [[Milan Mladenovi\u0107]] decided to form a new band with an old friend \u2014 22-year-old guitarist [[Dragomir Mihajlovi\u0107|Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107]]. Playing music together again after being bandmates a few years earlier at Limunovo Drvo, Mladenovi\u0107 and Mihajlovi\u0107 decided to name their new band Katarina II after Mihajlovi\u0107's unrequited love \u2014 a girl named Katarina. Rounding out Katarina II's inaugural lineup were Du\u0161an Dejanovi\u0107 (another former Limunovo Drvo member) on drums and Zoran \"\u0160vaba\" Radomirovi\u0107 on bass guitar. \n\nDuring late 1982, after their performance at the Top\u010diderska zvezda cinema, the band was joined by the 23-year-old classically trained pianist [[Margita Stefanovi\u0107]]. Shortly after, the rhythm section left with Radomirovi\u0107 joining [[Du Du A]] and Dejanovi\u0107 going over to heated rivals [[Disciplina Ki\u010dme]].\n\nThe vacant drummer position was filled by Branko \"Mango\" Ku\u0161trin (formerly of [[Grupa I]]), but after he left within a month, Milan's former bandmate from \u0160arlo Akrobata [[Ivan Vdovi\u0107|Ivan \"VD\" Vdovi\u0107]] became the new drummer. At the same time, in early 1983, [[Bojan Pe\u010dar]] (former [[VIA Talas]] bassist) joined on bass. In spring 1983, the band took part in [[Zagreb]] Biennale, receiving positive reviews. Their material for the debut album material was recorded soon after, featuring guest appearance by actor [[Svetislav Gonci\u0107]] on [[tin whistle]]s. The recording sessions for the material were completed in [[Enco Lesi\u0107]]'s Druga Maca studio, however, the material was unusable due to a variety of reasons, most of them having to do with the studio's inferior technical equipment.\n\nThe following year, the band took the offer from fellow musician and [[Radio-Television Slovenia|RTV Ljubljana]]'s musical director [[Sr\u0111an Marjanovi\u0107]] of re-recording their debut album material in the state-owned media company's studios. Katarina II's [[Katarina II (album)|eponymous debut album]] was thus released in 1984 by RTV Ljubljana's in-house record label [[ZKP RTLJ]]. Mostly featuring Mladenovi\u0107's lyrics, except for the Mihajlovi\u0107-written tracks \"Vrt\" (\"The Garden\") and \"Platforme\" (\"The Platforms\"), while the music was a collaboration between the two, the material was produced by \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107 featuring guest appearances by Mario \u010celik on congas and [[Film (band)|Film]] member Jurij \"Kuzma Videosex\" Novoseli\u0107 on saxophone. Only 3,000 copies of the album were released, indicative of label's low commercial expectations.<ref name=\"eunet1\">{{cite web|url=http://solair.eunet.rs/~gabriel/intervju9.htm |title=Intervju #9 |publisher=Solair.eunet.rs |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}</ref> Though it got good reviews, receiving praise for successfully linking Mladenovi\u0107's descriptive lyrical sensibility with the energetic new wave sound on tracks like \"Aut\" (\"Out\"), \"Jesen\" (\"Autumn\"), \"Radostan dan\" (\"A Joyful Day\"), \"Treba da se \u010disti\" (\"It Ought To Be Cleaned\"), \"Ja znam\" (\"I Know\"), ''Katarina II'' album was not a commercial success. In a 1985 interview Mladenovi\u0107 complained about the album's poor sound quality, as well as what he felt to be lack of support from the label.<ref name=\"eunet1\">{{cite web|url=http://solair.eunet.rs/~gabriel/intervju9.htm |title=Intervju #9 |publisher=Solair.eunet.rs |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}</ref>\n\nSoon after their debut album, the band went through more lineup changes amid disagreements and personality clashes between Mladenovi\u0107 and Mihajlovi\u0107. Mihajlovi\u0107 also ran afoul of the law \u2014 a transgression that got him a jail stint \u2014 and after serving the punishment got informed by the rest of the band he was no longer a Katarina II member. However, since Mihajlovi\u0107 claimed rights to the \"Katarina II\" name, he forced the band into using another one. Later he collaborated with [[Vlada Divljan]] before moving to the [[United States]] where he has been residing ever since. Additionally, drummer Vdovi\u0107 left due to drug abuse problems, later joining [[Du Du A]] and the band [[Heroji (band)|Heroji]], being replaced by the former [[Luna (Serbian band)|Luna]] drummer [[Ivan Fece|Ivan \"Firchie\" Fece]]. The remaining members continued working as Ekatarina Velika, after [[Catherine II of Russia]], or EKV for short. Due to constant [[SFR Yugoslavia]]-wide touring, with frequent stops in [[Belgrade]], [[Zagreb]] and [[Ljubljana]], and occasional TV spots, the band's popularity had gradually grown.\n\n====Ekatarina Velika====\nIn early 1985, the band recorded their second studio album at [[SIM studio]] in Zagreb. Produced by Vladimir Smolec featuring guest appearances by [[Massimo Savi\u0107]] as well as Karlowy Wary member and SIM studio co-owner [[Tomo in der M\u00fchlen]], ''[[Ekatarina Velika (album)|Ekatarina Velika]]'' gave the band with its first bona fide hits, \"O\u010di boje meda\" (\"Honey Colored Eyes\"), \"Modro i zeleno\" (\"Indigo and Green\") and \"Tattoo\". In keeping with the theme of the \"Tattoo\" track, the album cover arranged by [[Du\u0161an Gerzi\u0107]] features the band members painted in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ritual body art. After the album release on 22 March 1985, they played outside of Yugoslavia for the first time, making a positive impression at Culture Days in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. Another memorable concert took place in Zagreb as part of ''Bolje vas na\u0161li'' Belgrade-Zagreb band exchange.\n\nTowards the end of 1985, Fece left the band to serve his mandatory [[Yugoslav People's Army]] service, later joining [[Laboratorija Zvuka]], and was replaced by Ivan \"Raka\" Rankovi\u0107 from the band [[Tvrdo Srce i Velike U\u0161i]]. The following year, the new lineup released the third studio album ''[[S vetrom uz lice (album)|S vetrom uz lice]]'' (''Faced Against the Wind''), proving to be the breakthrough album that turned them into bona fide stars. The album was produced by Milan Mladenovi\u0107, Margita Stefanovi\u0107 and Dragan \u010ca\u010dinovi\u0107, extensively using the [[E-mu Emulator II]] 8-bit sampler. With the hits \"Budi sam na ulici\" (\"Be Alone on the Street\"), \"Ti si sav moj bol\" (\"You Are All My Anguish\"), \"Novac u rukama\" (\"Money in the Hands\"), and \"Kao da je bilo nekad\" (\"As If It Had Once Been\") came some lukewarm reviews from the critics complaining about the similarities to the works of the [[Simple Minds]].\n\nAfter the album release, the band toured extensively all over former Yugoslavia, and the recording of one of the five sold-out performances at the Zagreb club [[Kulu\u0161i\u0107]], made on 2 November 1986, was released in early 1987 on the live album ''[[19LIVE86]]''. The band promoted the release of the live album in Belgrade during January 1987 and triumphed at [[Dom omladine Beograda|Dom Omladine]] with six sold-out shows. During spring of the same year, Ivan Rankovi\u0107 decided to leave EKV in order to form a new group Ulica Od Meseca with his old bandmates from Tvrdo Srce i Velike U\u0161i. Rankovi\u0107 was replaced by the actor [[Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107]], a former [[Disciplina Ki\u010dme]] member, as  drummer, playing his first show on 9 April 1987 at the New Rock festival held at the La Locomotive club in [[Paris]]. On autumn of the same year, the band got the Sedam Sekretara SKOJa award for the achievements on the second and third studio album.\n\n=== Alternative rock years (1987\u20131991) ===\nDuring the summer of 1987, the band released the album ''[[Ljubav (Ekatarina Velika album)|Ljubav]]'' (''Love''), co-produced by the band with the [[Australia]]n musician Theodore Yanni. It displayed a more guitar-oriented sound, along with stylized sleeve done by Margita and artist [[Vuk Vidor]]. Prominent tracks from the album include \"Zemlja\" (\"Earth\"), \"7 Dana\" (\"7 Days\"), \"Pored mene\" (\"Beside Me\"), \"Ljudi iz gradova\" (\"People From The Cities\"), and \"Ljubav\" (\"Love\"). It had also shown the first signs of Milan's depressive lyrics, as exemplified by song \"Tonemo\" (\"We Are Sinking\"). The album had also confirmed their live attraction status with two consecutive sold out shows at Belgrade's [[Pionir Hall]] sports arena. New extensive tour commenced in early 1988, and EKV enlisted help from [[Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107]] of [[Oktobar 1864]] and [[Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107]] from [[Van Gogh (band)|Van Gogh]] to appear as backing live musicians. Fece had also promptly rejoined the band on tour, shortly replacing Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107 before moving away to [[New York City]] in May 1988.\n\nIn January 1989, the band finished the recording sessions for the album ''[[Samo par godina za nas (album)|Samo par godina za nas]]'' (''Only a Few Years for Us''), released during the same year, featuring guest appearances by [[Mitar Suboti\u0107]] (guitar, album production) and Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 (backing vocals). The critics regarded this album as a mere of the concept from the previous album. Several hits from the album include \"Krug\" (\"The Circle\"), \"Par godina za nas\" (\"A Few Years for Us\"), and \"Srce\" (\"Heart\"). Despite the mixed critics, the band were at their peak performing at the EBU-UER rock festival in [[Novi Sad]], the 1990 [[Midem]] festival in [[Cannes]] and the first [[Europe]]an rock music bienalle held in [[Toulouse]]. After the tour, Todorovi\u0107 left the band, focusing on his acting career. Bojan Pe\u010dar also decided to leave the band moving to [[London]]. The new members became the former [[VIA Talas]], [[D' Boys]] and [[Piloti]] member Mi\u0161ko Petrovi\u0107 \"Plavi\" on bass and the former [[U \u0160kripcu]] member [[Marko Milivojevi\u0107]] on drums.\n\nThe sixth studio album ''[[Dum Dum (Ekatarina Velika album)|Dum dum]]'' (''Bang Bang''), released in 1991, featured the [[Plejboj]] member Du\u0161an Petrovi\u0107 and session musician Bata Bo\u017eani\u0107 as bass players, Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 on backing vocals, Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107 on guitar and Mitar Suboti\u0107 on keyboards and machines. The album, produced by Theodore Yanni, featured the prominent songs \"Zabranjujem\" (\"I Forbid\"), \"Idemo\" (\"Let's Go\"), \"Dum dum\" (\"Bang Bang\") and \"Bledo\" (\"Pale\"), inspired by the outbreak of the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and the general political and economic situation in the country. The following year, Mladenovi\u0107 participated in the antiwar project [[Rimtutituki]], also featuring [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]] and [[Partibrejkers]] members, releasing the single \"Slu\u0161aj 'vamo\" (\"Listen Up\").\n\n=== Mainstream rock years (1992\u20131994) ===\nDuring the middle of 1992 the band toured with the new bassist Dragi\u0161a Uskokovi\u0107 \"\u0106ima\", with whom they recorded the final studio album ''[[Neko nas posmatra (album)|Neko nas posmatra]]'' (''Somebody Is Watching Us''), released in May 1993. The album featured a more accessible and communicative sound especially present in the songs \"Ponos\" (\"Pride\"), \"Jadransko more\" (\"The [[Adriatic Sea]]\"), \"Just Let Me Play Some Modern R'n'R Music\" and \"Zajedno\" (\"Together\"). For the first time, the band had included a cover song on and album, \"Istina Ma\u0161ina\" (\"Truth Machine\"), originally performed by the [[SFR Yugoslav pop and rock scene|Yugoslav rock]] band [[Time (rock band)|Time]]. The album was produced by Mladenovi\u0107 and featured Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107, Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 and a childer choir as guest performers.\n\nAfter the album release, in September of the same year, Ekatarina Velika, [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]], [[Partibrejkers]] and the [[Zagreb]] band [[Vje\u0161tice]] performed in [[Prague]] and [[Berlin]] on the concerts entitled ''Ko to tamo pjeva'' (''[[Who's That Singing Over There]]''). At the time, Mladenovi\u0107 and Stefanovi\u0107 held occasional [[Acoustic music|unplugged]] club performances, often featuring guest appearances by the Partibrejkers guitarist [[Neboj\u0161a Antonijevi\u0107|Neboj\u0161a Antonijevi\u0107 \"Anton\"]] and various jazz musicians, until Milan's departure to [[Brazil]], where he worked on a project called Angel's Breath, together with Mitar Suboti\u0107 and a line-up of Brazilian musicians. The two started recording the material partially written in 1985 when, with the guitarist [[Goran Vejvoda]], they had several live appearances under the moniker Dah An\u0111ela (''Angel's Breath'').\n\n=== Breakup and post-breakup ===\nThe band resumed their activities when Mladenovi\u0107 returned to Yugoslavia. There were plans to make a new album, tentatively titled ''Ponovo zajedno'' (''Together Again''), but the idea was shelved because of Milan's health problems. EKV played what would turn out to be their last ever show on 24 August 1994 in [[Budva]] at the [[Pjesma Mediterana]] festival. The very next day Milan was held in a hospital, and it was soon discovered that he had [[pancreatic cancer]]. Barely a few months later, on 5 November 1994, Milan Mladenovi\u0107 died in Belgrade, at the age of 36, thus Ekatarina Velika ceased to exist.\n\nMargita Stefanovi\u0107 continued working as a musician, for a short period of time performing with the cover band Kurajberi. In 1995, with Vladimir Stojanovi\u0107, as an [[ambiental music]] duo EQV, she released the album ''Ti si sav moj bol'' (''You Are All My Anguish''), released by the [[Austria]]n record label Coop Arts Crafts Unltd. In October of the same year, EQV appeared at the [[Vienna]] Talkit festival. She had also made occasional live appearances with the bands [[Direktori]], Glisers and Zion Banda, and appeared as guest on the albums of several Belgrade rock bands. In 1996, she appeared on the [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]] unplugged live album ''[[\u017divo i akusti\u010dno]]'' (''Live and Acoustic''), and in 1998, on the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] signing, she appeared in [[Pula]] with Zoran Stojanovi\u0107, the leader of the [[Zagreb]] band Veliki Bijeli Slon, being, along with [[Rambo Amadeus]], the first Serbian musician to play in [[Croatia]] after the [[Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nDuring the early 1997, a posthumous live album entitled ''Live '88'' was released, featuring the recordings of the performances from Zagreb and Novi Sad held during the 1988 tour. The Zagreb recordings, made at the Kulu\u0161i\u0107 club, were announced by the rock critic [[Dra\u017een Vrdoljak]] and featured Theodore Yanni on guest guitar. The live recordings were owned by Fece who initiated the album release. During the same year, Margita Stefanovi\u0107 founded the record label EKV Records and started reissuing EKV studio album with bonus material. The ''Ljubav'' reissue featured live bonus material made at the Belgrade Dom Omladine on 13 November 1991 and the 1988 Novi Sad SNP performance, ''Samo par godina za nas'' featured the live bonus tracks from the Avala fest held in September 1990 and ''Dum dum'' featured alternate and demo recordings and the 1991 Dom Omladine live tracks.\n\n[[PGP RTS]] also contributed the CD reissuing by releasing the compilation album ''Kao nada, kao govor, kao more...'' (''Like Hope, Like Speech, Like the Sea...'') in 1997, featuring selected material from the latter four studio albums. During 2001 and 2002, EKV Records and IPS music reissued the rest of the band's catalog, also featuring bonus live material. The label also released the live album ''Kao u snu - EKV live 1991'' (''As If in a Dream - EKV Live 1991'') featuring the Belgrade Dom Omladine 1991 performance. During the same year, a tribute album ''Kao da je bilo nekad... (Posve\u0107eno Milanu Mladenovi\u0107u)'' (''As If It Had Once Been'') was released. The following year, a live tribute album ''Jako dobar tattoo - Tribute to EKV'' (''A Very Good Tatto - Tribute to EKV'') was released.\n\nIn 2017, Mascom Records released the double live album ''Krug'' (''The Circle''), featuring the recording of Mladenovi\u0107's and Stefanovi\u0107's unplugged performance held in [[Pri\u0161tina]] in May 1994, only half a year before Mladenovi\u0107's death.<ref>[http://www.rockomotiva.com/fresh/albumi/nikada-objavljeni-snimak-ekatarine-velike-zatvaranje-kruga/ \"Nikada objavljeni snimak Ekatarine Velike: Zatvaranje \u2018Kruga\u2019\", Rockomotiva.com]</ref>\n\nIvan Vdovi\u0107 died of [[AIDS]] on 25 September 1992 at age 31. Milan Mladenovi\u0107 died of pancreatic cancer on 5 November 1994 at age 36. Bojan Pe\u010dar died of a heart attack on 13 October 1998 at age 38. Du\u0161an Dejanovi\u0107 died of AIDS on 16 November 2000. On 18 September 2002 Margita Stefanovi\u0107 died at age 43, being the fifth band member to die prematurely.\n\n== Legacy ==\nEkatarina Velika is considered one of the top and most influential acts of the [[yu rock|former Yugoslav rock scene]]. Of the bands heavily influenced by Ekatarina Velika, by far the most notable is [[Van Gogh (band)|Van Gogh]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Zabava/Vesti/187499/Djule-Zivim-kao-sav-normalan-svet |title=\"\u0110ule: \u017divim kao sav normalan svet\", interview with Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107 |publisher=Blic.rs |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nadlanu.com/Uploads/File/Van%20Gogh%20intervju.pdf Interview with Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107, nadlanu.com]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> which has risen to the status of one of the most popular rock acts in Serbia in the second half of the 1990s. Another band highly inspired by EKV is the alternative rock band [[Block Out (band)|Block Out]].

The group's core consisted of singer and guitarist Milan Mladenovi\u0107, keyboardist [[Margita Stefanovi\u0107]] and bassist [[Bojan Pe\u010dar]], with other members mostly remaining for comparatively shorter periods.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Post-punk years (1982\u20131986) ===\n====Katarina II====\nIn February 1982, following the disbandment of [[\u0160arlo Akrobata]], 24-year-old guitarist and vocalist [[Milan Mladenovi\u0107]] decided to form a new band with an old friend \u2014 22-year-old guitarist [[Dragomir Mihajlovi\u0107|Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107]]. Playing music together again after being bandmates a few years earlier at Limunovo Drvo, Mladenovi\u0107 and Mihajlovi\u0107 decided to name their new band Katarina II after Mihajlovi\u0107's unrequited love \u2014 a girl named Katarina. Rounding out Katarina II's inaugural lineup were Du\u0161an Dejanovi\u0107 (another former Limunovo Drvo member) on drums and Zoran \"\u0160vaba\" Radomirovi\u0107 on bass guitar. \n\nDuring late 1982, after their performance at the Top\u010diderska zvezda cinema, the band was joined by the 23-year-old classically trained pianist [[Margita Stefanovi\u0107]]. Shortly after, the rhythm section left with Radomirovi\u0107 joining [[Du Du A]] and Dejanovi\u0107 going over to heated rivals [[Disciplina Ki\u010dme]].\n\nThe vacant drummer position was filled by Branko \"Mango\" Ku\u0161trin (formerly of [[Grupa I]]), but after he left within a month, Milan's former bandmate from \u0160arlo Akrobata [[Ivan Vdovi\u0107|Ivan \"VD\" Vdovi\u0107]] became the new drummer. At the same time, in early 1983, [[Bojan Pe\u010dar]] (former [[VIA Talas]] bassist) joined on bass. In spring 1983, the band took part in [[Zagreb]] Biennale, receiving positive reviews. Their material for the debut album material was recorded soon after, featuring guest appearance by actor [[Svetislav Gonci\u0107]] on [[tin whistle]]s. The recording sessions for the material were completed in [[Enco Lesi\u0107]]'s Druga Maca studio, however, the material was unusable due to a variety of reasons, most of them having to do with the studio's inferior technical equipment.\n\nThe following year, the band took the offer from fellow musician and [[Radio-Television Slovenia|RTV Ljubljana]]'s mucial director [[Sr\u0111an Marjanovi\u0107]] of re-recording their debut album material in the state-owned media company's studios. Katarina II's [[Katarina II (album)|eponymous debut album]] was thus released in 1984 by RTV Ljubljana's in-house record label [[ZKP RTLJ]]. Mostly featuring Mladenovi\u0107's lyrics, except for the Mihajlovi\u0107-written tracks \"Vrt\" (\"The Garden\") and \"Platforme\" (\"The Platforms\"), while the music was a collaboration between the two, the material was produced by \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107 featuring guest appearances by Mario \u010celik on congas and [[Film (band)|Film]] member Jurij \"Kuzma Videosex\" Novoseli\u0107 on saxophone. Only 3,000 copies of the album were released, indicative of label's low commercial expectations.<ref name=\"eunet1\">{{cite web|url=http://solair.eunet.rs/~gabriel/intervju9.htm |title=Intervju #9 |publisher=Solair.eunet.rs |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}</ref> Though it got good reviews, receiving praise for successfully linking Mladenovi\u0107's descriptive lyrical sensibility with the energetic new wave sound on tracks like \"Aut\" (\"Out\"), \"Jesen\" (\"Autumn\"), \"Radostan dan\" (\"A Joyful Day\"), \"Treba da se \u010disti\" (\"It Ought To Be Cleaned\"), \"Ja znam\" (\"I Know\"), ''Katarina II'' album was not a commercial success. In a 1985 interview Mladenovi\u0107 complained about the album's poor sound quality, as well as what he felt to be lack of support from the label.<ref name=\"eunet1\">{{cite web|url=http://solair.eunet.rs/~gabriel/intervju9.htm |title=Intervju #9 |publisher=Solair.eunet.rs |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}</ref>\n\nSoon after their debut album, the band went through more lineup changes amid disagreements and personality clashes between Mladenovi\u0107 and Mihajlovi\u0107. Mihajlovi\u0107 also ran afoul of the law \u2014 a transgression that got him a jail stint \u2014 and after serving the punishment got informed by the rest of the band he was no longer a Katarina II member. However, since Mihajlovi\u0107 claimed rights to the \"Katarina II\" name, he forced the band into using another one. Later he collaborated with [[Vlada Divljan]] before moving to the [[United States]] where he has been residing ever since. Additionally, drummer Vdovi\u0107 left due to drug abuse problems, later joining [[Du Du A]] and the band [[Heroji (band)|Heroji]], being replaced by the former [[Luna (Serbian band)|Luna]] drummer [[Ivan Fece|Ivan \"Firchie\" Fece]]. The remaining members continued working as Ekatarina Velika, after [[Catherine II of Russia]], or EKV for short. Due to constant [[SFR Yugoslavia]]-wide touring, with frequent stops in [[Belgrade]], [[Zagreb]] and [[Ljubljana]], and occasional TV spots, the band's popularity had gradually grown.\n\n====Ekatarina Velika====\nIn early 1985, the band recorded their second studio album at [[SIM studio]] in Zagreb. Produced by Vladimir Smolec featuring guest appearances by [[Massimo Savi\u0107]] as well as Karlowy Wary member and SIM studio co-owner [[Tomo in der M\u00fchlen]], ''[[Ekatarina Velika (album)|Ekatarina Velika]]'' gave the band with its first bona fide hits, \"O\u010di boje meda\" (\"Honey Colored Eyes\"), \"Modro i zeleno\" (\"Indigo and Green\") and \"Tattoo\". In keeping with the theme of the \"Tattoo\" track, the album cover arranged by [[Du\u0161an Gerzi\u0107]] features the band members painted in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ritual body art. After the album release on 22 March 1985, they played outside of Yugoslavia for the first time, making a positive impression at Culture Days in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. Another memorable concert took place in Zagreb as part of ''Bolje vas na\u0161li'' Belgrade-Zagreb band exchange.\n\nTowards the end of 1985, Fece left the band to serve his mandatory [[Yugoslav People's Army]] service, later joining [[Laboratorija Zvuka]], and was replaced by Ivan \"Raka\" Rankovi\u0107 from the band [[Tvrdo Srce i Velike U\u0161i]]. The following year, the new lineup released the third studio album ''[[S vetrom uz lice (album)|S vetrom uz lice]]'' (''Faced Against the Wind''), proving to be the breakthrough album that turned them into bona fide stars. The album was produced by Milan Mladenovi\u0107, Margita Stefanovi\u0107 and Dragan \u010ca\u010dinovi\u0107, extensively using the [[E-mu Emulator II]] 8-bit sampler. With the hits \"Budi sam na ulici\" (\"Be Alone on the Street\"), \"Ti si sav moj bol\" (\"You Are All My Anguish\"), \"Novac u rukama\" (\"Money in the Hands\"), and \"Kao da je bilo nekad\" (\"As If It Had Once Been\") came some lukewarm reviews from the critics complaining about the similarities to the works of the [[Simple Minds]].\n\nAfter the album release, the band toured extensively all over former Yugoslavia, and the recording of one of the five sold-out performances at the Zagreb club [[Kulu\u0161i\u0107]], made on 2 November 1986, was released in early 1987 on the live album ''[[19LIVE86]]''. The band promoted the release of the live album in Belgrade during January 1987 and triumphed at [[Dom omladine Beograda|Dom Omladine]] with six sold-out shows. During spring of the same year, Ivan Rankovi\u0107 decided to leave EKV in order to form a new group Ulica Od Meseca with his old bandmates from Tvrdo Srce i Velike U\u0161i. Rankovi\u0107 was replaced by the actor [[Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107]], a former [[Disciplina Ki\u010dme]] member, as  drummer, playing his first show on 9 April 1987 at the New Rock festival held at the La Locomotive club in [[Paris]]. On autumn of the same year, the band got the Sedam Sekretara SKOJa award for the achievements on the second and third studio album.\n\n=== Alternative rock years (1987\u20131991) ===\nDuring the summer of 1987, the band released the album ''[[Ljubav (Ekatarina Velika album)|Ljubav]]'' (''Love''), co-produced by the band with the [[Australia]]n musician Theodore Yanni. It displayed a more guitar-oriented sound, along with stylized sleeve done by Margita and artist [[Vuk Vidor]]. Prominent tracks from the album include \"Zemlja\" (\"Earth\"), \"7 Dana\" (\"7 Days\"), \"Pored mene\" (\"Beside Me\"), \"Ljudi iz gradova\" (\"People From The Cities\"), and \"Ljubav\" (\"Love\"). It had also shown the first signs of Milan's depressive lyrics, as exemplified by song \"Tonemo\" (\"We Are Sinking\"). The album had also confirmed their live attraction status with two consecutive sold out shows at Belgrade's [[Pionir Hall]] sports arena. New extensive tour commenced in early 1988, and EKV enlisted help from [[Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107]] of [[Oktobar 1864]] and [[Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107]] from [[Van Gogh (band)|Van Gogh]] to appear as backing live musicians. Fece had also promptly rejoined the band on tour, shortly replacing Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107 before moving away to [[New York City]] in May 1988.\n\nIn January 1989, the band finished the recording sessions for the album ''[[Samo par godina za nas (album)|Samo par godina za nas]]'' (''Only a Few Years for Us''), released during the same year, featuring guest appearances by [[Mitar Suboti\u0107]] (guitar, album production) and Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 (backing vocals). The critics regarded this album as a mere of the concept from the previous album. Several hits from the album include \"Krug\" (\"The Circle\"), \"Par godina za nas\" (\"A Few Years for Us\"), and \"Srce\" (\"Heart\"). Despite the mixed critics, the band were at their peak performing at the EBU-UER rock festival in [[Novi Sad]], the 1990 [[Midem]] festival in [[Cannes]] and the first [[Europe]]an rock music bienalle held in [[Toulouse]]. After the tour, Todorovi\u0107 left the band, focusing on his acting career. Bojan Pe\u010dar also decided to leave the band moving to [[London]]. The new members became the former [[VIA Talas]], [[D' Boys]] and [[Piloti]] member Mi\u0161ko Petrovi\u0107 \"Plavi\" on bass and the former [[U \u0160kripcu]] member [[Marko Milivojevi\u0107]] on drums.\n\nThe sixth studio album ''[[Dum Dum (Ekatarina Velika album)|Dum dum]]'' (''Bang Bang''), released in 1991, featured the [[Plejboj]] member Du\u0161an Petrovi\u0107 and session musician Bata Bo\u017eani\u0107 as bass players, Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 on backing vocals, Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107 on guitar and Mitar Suboti\u0107 on keyboards and machines. The album, produced by Theodore Yanni, featured the prominent songs \"Zabranjujem\" (\"I Forbid\"), \"Idemo\" (\"Let's Go\"), \"Dum dum\" (\"Bang Bang\") and \"Bledo\" (\"Pale\"), inspired by the outbreak of the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and the general political and economic situation in the country. The following year, Mladenovi\u0107 participated in the antiwar project [[Rimtutituki]], also featuring [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]] and [[Partibrejkers]] members, releasing the single \"Slu\u0161aj 'vamo\" (\"Listen Up\").\n\n=== Mainstream rock years (1992\u20131994) ===\nDuring the middle of 1992 the band toured with the new bassist Dragi\u0161a Uskokovi\u0107 \"\u0106ima\", with whom they recorded the final studio album ''[[Neko nas posmatra (album)|Neko nas posmatra]]'' (''Somebody Is Watching Us''), released in May 1993. The album featured a more accessible and communicative sound especially present in the songs \"Ponos\" (\"Pride\"), \"Jadransko more\" (\"The [[Adriatic Sea]]\"), \"Just Let Me Play Some Modern R'n'R Music\" and \"Zajedno\" (\"Together\"). For the first time, the band had included a cover song on and album, \"Istina Ma\u0161ina\" (\"Truth Machine\"), originally performed by the [[SFR Yugoslav pop and rock scene|Yugoslav rock]] band [[Time (rock band)|Time]]. The album was produced by Mladenovi\u0107 and featured Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107, Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 and a childer choir as guest performers.\n\nAfter the album release, in September of the same year, Ekatarina Velika, [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]], [[Partibrejkers]] and the [[Zagreb]] band [[Vje\u0161tice]] performed in [[Prague]] and [[Berlin]] on the concerts entitled ''Ko to tamo pjeva'' (''[[Who's That Singing Over There]]''). At the time, Mladenovi\u0107 and Stefanovi\u0107 held occasional [[Acoustic music|unplugged]] club performances, often featuring guest appearances by the Partibrejkers guitarist [[Neboj\u0161a Antonijevi\u0107|Neboj\u0161a Antonijevi\u0107 \"Anton\"]] and various jazz musicians, until Milan's departure to [[Brazil]], where he worked on a project called Angel's Breath, together with Mitar Suboti\u0107 and a line-up of Brazilian musicians. The two started recording the material partially written in 1985 when, with the guitarist [[Goran Vejvoda]], they had several live appearances under the moniker Dah An\u0111ela (''Angel's Breath'').\n\n=== Breakup and post-breakup ===\nThe band resumed their activities when Mladenovi\u0107 returned to Yugoslavia. There were plans to make a new album, tentatively titled ''Ponovo zajedno'' (''Together Again''), but the idea was shelved because of Milan's health problems. EKV played what would turn out to be their last ever show on 24 August 1994 in [[Budva]] at the [[Pjesma Mediterana]] festival. The very next day Milan was held in a hospital, and it was soon discovered that he had [[pancreatic cancer]]. Barely a few months later, on 5 November 1994, Milan Mladenovi\u0107 died in Belgrade, at the age of 36, thus Ekatarina Velika ceased to exist.\n\nMargita Stefanovi\u0107 continued working as a musician, for a short period of time performing with the cover band Kurajberi. In 1995, with Vladimir Stojanovi\u0107, as an [[ambiental music]] duo EQV, she released the album ''Ti si sav moj bol'' (''You Are All My Anguish''), released by the [[Austria]]n record label Coop Arts Crafts Unltd. In October of the same year, EQV appeared at the [[Vienna]] Talkit festival. She had also made occasional live appearances with the bands [[Direktori]], Glisers and Zion Banda, and appeared as guest on the albums of several Belgrade rock bands. In 1996, she appeared on the [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]] unplugged live album ''[[\u017divo i akusti\u010dno]]'' (''Live and Acoustic''), and in 1998, on the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] signing, she appeared in [[Pula]] with Zoran Stojanovi\u0107, the leader of the [[Zagreb]] band Veliki Bijeli Slon, being, along with [[Rambo Amadeus]], the first Serbian musician to play in [[Croatia]] after the [[Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nDuring the early 1997, a posthumous live album entitled ''Live '88'' was released, featuring the recordings of the performances from Zagreb and Novi Sad held during the 1988 tour. The Zagreb recordings, made at the Kulu\u0161i\u0107 club, were announced by the rock critic [[Dra\u017een Vrdoljak]] and featured Theodore Yanni on guest guitar. The live recordings were owned by Fece who initiated the album release. During the same year, Margita Stefanovi\u0107 founded the record label EKV Records and started reissuing EKV studio album with bonus material. The ''Ljubav'' reissue featured live bonus material made at the Belgrade Dom Omladine on 13 November 1991 and the 1988 Novi Sad SNP performance, ''Samo par godina za nas'' featured the live bonus tracks from the Avala fest held in September 1990 and ''Dum dum'' featured alternate and demo recordings and the 1991 Dom Omladine live tracks.\n\n[[PGP RTS]] also contributed the CD reissuing by releasing the compilation album ''Kao nada, kao govor, kao more...'' (''Like Hope, Like Speech, Like the Sea...'') in 1997, featuring selected material from the latter four studio albums. During 2001 and 2002, EKV Records and IPS music reissued the rest of the band's catalog, also featuring bonus live material. The label also released the live album ''Kao u snu - EKV live 1991'' (''As If in a Dream - EKV Live 1991'') featuring the Belgrade Dom Omladine 1991 performance. During the same year, a tribute album ''Kao da je bilo nekad... (Posve\u0107eno Milanu Mladenovi\u0107u)'' (''As If It Had Once Been'') was released. The following year, a live tribute album ''Jako dobar tattoo - Tribute to EKV'' (''A Very Good Tatto - Tribute to EKV'') was released.\n\nIn 2017, Mascom Records released the double live album ''Krug'' (''The Circle''), featuring the recording of Mladenovi\u0107's and Stefanovi\u0107's unplugged performance held in [[Pri\u0161tina]] in May 1994, only half a year before Mladenovi\u0107's death.<ref>[http://www.rockomotiva.com/fresh/albumi/nikada-objavljeni-snimak-ekatarine-velike-zatvaranje-kruga/ \"Nikada objavljeni snimak Ekatarine Velike: Zatvaranje \u2018Kruga\u2019\", Rockomotiva.com]</ref>\n\nIvan Vdovi\u0107 died of [[AIDS]] on 25 September 1992 at age 31. Milan Mladenovi\u0107 died of pancreatic cancer on 5 November 1994 at age 36. Bojan Pe\u010dar died of a heart attack on 13 October 1998 at age 38. Du\u0161an Dejanovi\u0107 died of AIDS on 16 November 2000. On 18 September 2002 Margita Stefanovi\u0107 died at age 43, being the fifth band member to die prematurely.\n\n== Legacy ==\nEkatarina Velika is considered one of the top and most influential acts of the [[yu rock|former Yugoslav rock scene]]. Of the bands heavily influenced by Ekatarina Velika, by far the most notable is [[Van Gogh (band)|Van Gogh]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Zabava/Vesti/187499/Djule-Zivim-kao-sav-normalan-svet |title=\"\u0110ule: \u017divim kao sav normalan svet\", interview with Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107 |publisher=Blic.rs |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nadlanu.com/Uploads/File/Van%20Gogh%20intervju.pdf Interview with Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107, nadlanu.com]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> which has risen to the status of one of the most popular rock acts in Serbia in the second half of the 1990s. Another band highly inspired by EKV is the alternative rock band [[Block Out (band)|Block Out]]. The band's work was also praised by Yugoslav rock icons like Rambo Amadeus and Dado Topic\n\nIn 2003, a tribute album to Mladenovi\u0107 entitled ''[[Kao da je bilo nekad... Posve\u0107eno Milanu Mladenovi\u0107u]]'' (''Like It Happened Someday... Dedicated to Milan Mladenovi\u0107'') was released. The album consists of 15 covers of Mladenovi\u0107's songs (14 EKV and one \u0160arlo Akrobata song) by a range of musicians, spanning from rock veteran [[Dado Topi\u0107]], over EKV contemporaries like [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]], [[Darko Rundek]], [[Partibrejkers]], [[Mi\u0161ko Plavi]], [[Vlada Divljan]], [[Del Arno Band]], and [[Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107]], to younger acts, like [[Jarboli]], [[Darkwood Dub]], [[Novembar]], [[Night Shift (band)|Night Shift]], Block Out, and [[Vroom (band)|VROOM]]. Mladenovi\u0107's former \u0160arlo Akrobata bandmate [[Du\u0161an Koji\u0107]] also appeared on the album under the pseudonym Crni Zub, participating in the cover of \"Zemlja\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090206113606/http://www.discogs.com/Various-Kao-Da-Je-Bilo-Nekad--Posve%C4%87eno-Milanu-Mladenovi%C4%87u/release/1520464 ''Kao da je bilo nekad...

Any firearms so defined that were already possessed at the time the law took effect were grandfathered in, and could be legally owned or transferred.

It included semi-automatic pistols with a detachable magazine and at least two of these features: a magazine that attaches outside the pistol grip, a threaded barrel, a [[barrel shroud]], or an unloaded weight of 50 ounces or more. Additionally defined as assault weapons were semi-automatic [[shotgun]]s with a rotating cylinder, or with at least two of these features: a pistol grip, a folding or telescoping stock, a detachable magazine, or a fixed magazine that can hold more than five rounds.<ref name=Koerner040916>{{cite news |last=Koerner |first=Brendan |date=September 16, 2004 |title=What Is an Assault Weapon?

Stenz, SVD (1869\u20131928): Chinamissionar im Kaiserreich und in der Republik\", Steyler Verlag, Nettetal, 1994</ref>) was a Catholic missionary of the [[Society of the Divine Word]] in [[Shandong]] during the period from 1893 to 1927. He was involved in two major incidents where force was used against Catholic missionaries in Shandong, the [[Juye incident]] and the [[Jietou incident]]. The Juye incident (1897) was an attack on Stenz's mission station in Zhang Jia Village in which two German missionaries were killed. Stenz, who was the likely target of the attack, managed to hide and escaped unharmed. The incident was used by the [[German Empire]] to justify the occupation of [[Qingdao]]. In the Jietou incident, Stenz and a group of Chinese Christians were mistreated and held prisoner in the village of Jietou ({{zh|c=\u8857\u5934\u9547|p=Ji\u0113t\u00f3u zh\u00e8n}}, Rizhao) for three days (8\u201311 November 1898) resulting in German military intervention and compensation claims.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn  in [[Horhausen, Altenkirchen|Horhausen]], Westerwald,<ref name=\"M\u00fchlhahn2000\"/> Georg Stenz was the son of the elementary school teacher Jacob Stenz and his wife Maria (n\u00e9e Dasbach). He was the oldest of 4 children (2 boys and 5 girls) of which only he and his sister Maria (born 1878) lived to adulthood.<ref name=puhl/> He attended the elementary school in Horhausen, where his father was a teacher from 1875 to 1880. From 1880 to the fall of 1881, he was given private lessons by a chaplain in Horhausen, possibly for health reasons.<ref name=puhl/> In the fall of 1881, he entered the second year (quinta) of a secondary school (gymnasium) in [[Montabaur]] where he lived in a residence (konvikt) of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg|Diocese of Limburg]].<ref name=puhl/>  In February 1887, he requested admission to the mission Divine Word Missionaries in Style, where he continued his education from April 25, 1887 onwards in the missionaries' secondary school (\"Styler Lyzeum\").<ref name=puhl/>  He graduated from the Styler Lyzeum (matura) after two years.<ref name=puhl/>  Since the degree from the Styler Lyzeum was not recognized by the German state, he also gained a high-school diploma from the Montabaur secondary school in 1889 as an external student.<ref name=puhl/>  He became a novice and studied theology at the St. Gabriel mission house of the Divine Word Missionaries in [[Maria Enzersdorf]] to the southwest of Vienna.<ref name=puhl/>  He made his temporary vows at St. Gabriel on November 21, 1891 and was ordained as a priest in the same place on June 25, 1893.<ref name=puhl/>  He was sent on  mission to China on September 17, 1893 together with Joseph Hesser (1867-1920) and Josef Schneider (1867-1896) who had been ordained as priests with him.<ref name=puhl/>  The three traveled to [[Genoa]] via Cologne, Basel, Luzern, and Milan.<ref name=puhl/>  On September 25, 1893, the three missionaries boarded the steamship Bayern of the shipping company [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in Genoa.<ref name=puhl/>  After a voyage via Naples, Port Said, Suez, Aden, and Colombo, they arrived in Hong Kong on October 25.<ref name=puhl/>  After a few days stay in Hong Kong, Stenz traveled on the Bayern to Shanghai, where he arrived on October 29, 1893.<ref name=puhl/>\n\n==Activities as a missionary==\nAfter his arrival in Shandong, Georg Stenz stayed in the headquarters of the Society of the Divine Word in Shandong to learn Chinese.<ref name=puhl/> At the time, the headquarters was located in the town of Puoli (\u90ed\u91cc\u9547), about 30&nbsp;km southeast of the city of [[Jining]]. He stayed there until early 1895, when he was sent to work as an assistant to Franz-Xavier Nies in the mission station at Jiaxiang (\u5609\u7965\u9547),<ref name=puhl/> a town about 25&nbsp;km to the west of Jining. In the fall of 1896, Stenz was promoted to rector and took up his residence in the Zhang Jia Village (\u5f20\u5bb6\u5e84). His direct superior (dean) was Richard Henle.<ref name=puhl/> About one year after the arrival of Stenz in Zhang Jia Village, on November 1, 1897, he became the target of an attack, the Juye Incident, that killed Nies and Henle who were visiting Stenz in Zhang Jia Village at the time. In the fall of 1898, Stenz was relocated and given responsibility for the mission in the areas of [[Rizhao]] and [[Zhucheng]].<ref name=puhl/> Stenz travelled from Qingdao to Rizhao by sea on November 1, 1898 and embarked on a tour of the area. Seven days later, on November 8, he arrived in Jiechuang near the village of Jietou, about 35&nbsp;km northwest of Rizhao. There he was held captive and mistreated in the Jietou Incident until the magistrate of Rhizhao intervened and had him freed around noon on November 11. After the incident, Stenz was treated in a hospital in Qingdao. In the spring of 1899, Stenz participated in a German punitive expedition that was dispatched from Qingdao to Rizhao to avenge an attack on three Germans (a lieutenant, a mining engineer, and an interpreter).<ref name=puhl/> On June 16, 1899, a German newspaper (K\u00f6lnische Volkszeitung) ran a story that depicted life in the German colony of Qingdao in a negative light and blamed, e.g., German soldiers for lack of discipline, drunkenness, sexuell harassment of Chinese girls, and violent abuse of the local Chinese population.<ref name=puhl/> Although the article was published anonymously, Stenz was suspected to be the author and as a consequence was moved from Qingdao to Jining in early 1900 and was forbidden to write by Bishop Anzer.<ref name=puhl/> On April 25, 1900, Stenz left Jining to travel to Europe for medical treatment and recuperation. However, he may have been sent away because he was putting a strain on the relationship between the mission and the German authorities in Qingdao.<ref name=puhl/> While in Europe, Stenz participated in a push to remove the Vicar Apostolic of Southern Shandong, [[Johann Baptist von Anzer]], from office. Anzer came to Rome to defend himself, but died on November 24, 1903 before his case could be resolved.<ref name=puhl/> Stenz returned to Shandong on May 20, 1904. After his return, he continued to participate in several missionary education activities for more than 20 years.<ref name=puhl/>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Stenz grave cross.jpg|thumb|right|Cross on the grave of Georg Maria Stenz on the cemetery of the Society of the Divine Word in Techny, IL.]]\nStenz suffered from a stroke on March 17, 1927 that deprived him of the ability to speak.<ref name=puhl/> On May 3 of the same year, he traveled to the USA via Shanghai for recuperation. In [[Techny, Illinois]], he suffered from a second stroke on April 21, 1928 that left him unconscious. He died without having regained his consciousness on April 23.<ref name=puhl/> Georg Maria Stenz is buried on the cemetery of the compound of the Society of the Divine Word in Techny.\n\n==Attitude towards the Chinese==\nIn his writings, Stenz refers to the Chinese as \"yellow [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] men\" (\"gelber Zopfmann\") and claims that \"the Chinese in general\" (\"der Chinese im allgemeinen\") show what he considers \"very disagreeable character traits to Europeans\" (\"dem Europ\u00e4er gegen\u00fcber sehr unsympathische Charaktereigenschaften\").<ref name=stenz1902>Georg Maria Stenz, In der Heimat des Konfuzius: Skizzen, Bilder und Erlebnisse aus Schantung, Druck und Verlag der Missionsdruckerei, 1902</ref> In particular, he describes them as cunning (\"verschmitzt\") and with few exceptions incapable of true friendships (\"gediegene Freundschaften\"), as well as irascible (\"Zorn\"), cruel (\"Grausamkeit\"), cowardly (\"Feigheit\"), arrogant (\"Stolz\"), thankless (\"Undankbarkeit\"), and superstitious (\"abergl\u00e4ubisch\").<ref name=stenz1902/> He also describes the Chinese as filthy (\"Schmutzigkeit\"), but excuses this as a consequence of poverty.<ref name=stenz1902/>\n\n==Opinions about Georg M. Stenz==\n[[Joseph W. Esherick|Joseph Esherick]] has characterized Stenz as a \"particularly obnoxious missionary\" with \"a strikingly unattractive character\" who \"thoroughly typefied the militance of the S.V.D. mission\".<ref name=esherick>Joseph Esherick, The Origins of the Boxer Uprising, University of California Press, Jul 19, 1988</ref>\n\n==Works by Georg M.
