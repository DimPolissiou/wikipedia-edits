{"title_page": "Salzburg Conference", "text_new": "{{Good article}}\n{{short description|Conference between Nazi Germany and Slovakia, 1940}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L07689, Salzburg, Rippentrop, Gugurtu.jpg|thumb|[[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] meets the Prime Minister of Romania, [[Ion Gigurtu]], in Salzburg, 27 July 1940]]\n\nThe '''Salzburg Conference''' ({{lang-de|Salzburger Diktat}}){{sfn|Hutzelmann|2018|p=27}}  was a conference between [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Slovak State]], held on 28 July 1940, in [[Salzburg]], Germany. The Germans demanded the expulsion of the ''[[N\u00e1stup]]'' faction of the [[Slovak People's Party]] from the Slovak government because of its independent foreign policy, threatening to unilaterally revoke the protection guarantees that Slovakia had obtained in the [[1939 German\u2013Slovak treaty]]. \n\nThe result was Slovak capitulation to German demands and the replacement of ''N\u00e1stup'' supporters by members of the pro-German radical faction. Ultimately, the Slovak State became more strongly oriented towards Germany, especially in the area of anti-Jewish measures. However, aspects of the Slovak State's administration, such as the lack of qualified Slovak People's Party supporters in high-level positions and the adoption of the ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip]]'' with the conservative politician [[Jozef Tiso]] as its supreme leader, limited the impact of the German ultimatum.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Slovakia borderHungary.png|thumb|right|alt=Map of Slovakia reflecting southern losses to Hungary|Slovak territorial losses to Hungary in 1938 and 1939]]\n\n[[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] awarded much of southern Slovakia, then part of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic]], to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] with the [[First Vienna Award]] in 1938. On 14 March 1939, the [[Slovak State]] proclaimed its independence under German protection with Germany annexing the remaining Czech [[rump state]] on 15 March.{{sfn|Rajcan|Vadkerty|Hlavinka|2018|pp=842\u2013843}}{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|p=242}} In a [[German-Slovak treaty of 23 March 1939|treaty signed on 23 March]], Slovakia renounced much of its foreign-policy and military autonomy to Germany in exchange for border guarantees and economic assistance.{{sfn|Ward|2013|p=184}} \n\nThe Slovak State was a [[one-party state]] dominated by the [[Slovak People's Party]], which had two main factions, radical and conservative/[[clericalism|clerical]]. The radical branch was led by [[Vojtech Tuka]] and [[Alexander Mach]], commander of the paramilitary [[Hlinka Guard]], and was supported by Germany due to its acceptance of German dominion. President [[Jozef Tiso]]'s clerical branch was more popular among the Catholic clergy and the population. Both factions engaged in a power struggle, fighting for German support. Another faction was a group of intellectuals centered around the journal ''[[N\u00e1stup]]'', which was radical in its authoritarianism but opposed the imitation of Germany and insisted on an independent foreign policy; foreign minister [[Ferdinand \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd]] belonged to this group.{{sfn|Rajcan|Vadkerty|Hlavinka|2018|p=843}}{{sfn|Kamenec|2011|pp=184\u2013185}}{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|p=244}} Germany sought the expulsion of the N\u00e1stup group from positions of influence, as it could work with Tiso's faction which tended towards pragmatism in its foreign policy.{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|p=245}}\n\nThe summit took place during a quiet spell in the war, shortly after the [[fall of France]] and while the [[Operation Sealion|defeat of the United Kingdom]] and [[victory of Nazi Germany]] appeared likely. Germany's military successes strengthened its negotiating position against the Slovaks.{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|p=243}}{{sfn|T\u00f6nsmeyer|2003|p=64}} Germany sought to use the favorable conditions to deepen its [[sphere of influence]] in the [[Danube]] region and force its allies in the area into a closer relationship. Shortly before the summit, Hitler had met with Hungarian officials on 10 July, and with Romanian and Bulgarian officials on the two nights immediately preceding the Salzburg meeting.{{sfn|T\u00f6nsmeyer|2003|p=64}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Demands==\n\nIn mid-July 1940, Fuhrer [[Adolf Hitler]] invited Tiso, Tuka, and Mach to a summit held in Salzburg. The ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' wanted \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd to be invited, so that it could thwart any attempts by the latter to escape losing power.{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|p=245}}\n\nOn 28 July, Tiso first met privately with German foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], who informed the Slovaks that Germany considered Slovakia within its ''[[Lebensraum]]'', and therefore justified interference in Slovakia's internal affairs. He demanded that Tiso renounce his goal of a Catholic clerical state and dismiss  \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd, due to the latter's \"register of sins\"\u2014he had attempted to maintain communication with the Western powers and keep friendly relations with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|pp=245\u2013246}}{{sfn|Ward|2013|p=211}} In another meeting, [[Adolf Hitler]] hinted that failure to comply would leave the Slovak State at the mercy of Hungary, by revoking the protection guarantees that Slovakia had obtained in the [[German-Slovak treaty of 23 March 1939|1939 German\u2013Slovak treaty]].{{sfn|Ward|2013|pp=211\u2013212}}{{sfn|Piahanau|2012|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nThe Slovaks requested a revision of the First Vienna Award.{{sfn|Ward|2013|p=212}} Specifically, they wanted six former districts to be returned to Slovakia: [[Vr\u00e1ble]]-[[\u0160urany]], [[Lu\u010denec]],  [[Jel\u0161ava]],  [[Ko\u0161ice]],  north [[S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely]]  and [[Sobrance District]]\u2014{{convert|3600|km2}}. According to the Slovak foreign ministry, these areas contained 209,000 Slovaks and 100,000 Hungarians.{{sfn|Piahanau|2012|p=17}}\n\nAccording to Israeli historian {{ill|Yeshayahu Jelinek|de|Yeshayahu A. Jelinek}}, \"we lack many  details regarding the meeting, particularly  about instructions, if any, given to Tuka and Mach\".{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|p=246}}\n\n==Result==\n[[File:Salzburg Conference montage (Tiso and Hitler shake hands).jpg|thumb|Tiso and Hitler shake hands at the conference]]\n\nThe Slovaks conceded to the German ultimatum and agreed to replace influential N\u00e1stupists with reliably pro-German radicals.{{sfn|Legge|2018|p=228}}{{sfn|Hutzelmann|2018|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Rajcan|Vadkerty|Hlavinka|2018|pp=843\u2013844}} \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd was replaced as interior minister by Mach,{{sfn|Hutzelmann|2018|p=27}} while Tuka became foreign minister.{{sfn|Piahanau|2012|p=17}} {{ill|Jozef M. Kirschbaum|cs||sk}}, another N\u00e1stupist, was dismissed as Secretary-General of the Slovak People's Party, while Kon\u0161tant\u00edn \u010culen, the head of the Propaganda Ministry, was replaced by the radical Karol  Murga\u0161.{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|pp=246\u2013247}} Nevertheless, the Germans recognized that the radical candidates were not as competent as the men that they replaced, and were therefore careful not to go too far in demanding influential offices for them.{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|pp=247\u2013248}} \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd later claimed that his dismissal proved that he was anti-Nazi and actually a \"friend\" of Jews.{{sfn|Legge|2018|p=228}} \n\nThe conference marked a success for the radical faction of the party and a defeat for Tiso's clerical faction. Tiso considered the summit \"the worst box on the ears that I ever received\".

The Germans demanded the expulsion of the ''[[N\u00e1stup]]'' faction of the [[Slovak People's Party]] from the Slovak government because of its independent foreign policy, threatening to unilaterally revoke the protection guarantees that Slovakia had obtained in the [[1939 German\u2013Slovak treaty]]. \n\nThe result was Slovak capitulation to German demands and the replacement of ''N\u00e1stup'' supporters by members of the pro-German radical faction. Ultimately, the Slovak State became more strongly oriented towards Germany, especially in the area of anti-Jewish measures. However, aspects of the Slovak State's administration, such as the lack of qualified Slovak People's Party supporters in high-level positions and the adoption of the ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip]]'' with the conservative politician [[Jozef Tiso]] as its supreme leader, limited the impact of the German ultimatum.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Slovakia borderHungary.png|thumb|right|alt=Map of Slovakia reflecting southern losses to Hungary|Slovak territorial losses to Hungary in 1938 and 1939]]\n\n[[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] awarded much of southern Slovakia, then part of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic]], to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] with the [[First Vienna Award]] in 1938. On 14 March 1939, the [[Slovak State]] proclaimed its independence under German protection with Germany annexing the remaining Czech [[rump state]] on 15 March.{{sfn|Rajcan|Vadkerty|Hlavinka|2018|pp=842\u2013843}}{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|p=242}} In a [[German-Slovak treaty of 23 March 1939|treaty signed on 23 March]], Slovakia renounced much of its foreign-policy and military autonomy to Germany in exchange for border guarantees and economic assistance.{{sfn|Ward|2013|p=184}} \n\nThe Slovak State was a [[one-party state]] dominated by the [[Slovak People's Party]], which had two main factions, radical and conservative/[[clericalism|clerical]]. The radical branch was led by [[Vojtech Tuka]] and [[Alexander Mach]], commander of the paramilitary [[Hlinka Guard]], and was supported by Germany due to its acceptance of German dominion. President [[Jozef Tiso]]'s clerical branch was more popular among the Catholic clergy and the population. Both factions engaged in a power struggle, fighting for German support. Another faction was a group of intellectuals centered around the journal ''[[N\u00e1stup]]'', which was radical in its authoritarianism but opposed the imitation of Germany and insisted on an independent foreign policy; foreign minister [[Ferdinand \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd]] belonged to this group.{{sfn|Rajcan|Vadkerty|Hlavinka|2018|p=843}}{{sfn|Kamenec|2011|pp=184\u2013185}}{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|p=244}} Germany sought the expulsion of the N\u00e1stup group from positions of influence, as it could work with Tiso's faction which tended towards pragmatism in its foreign policy.{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|p=245}}\n\nThe summit took place during a quiet spell in the war, shortly after the [[fall of France]] and while the [[Operation Sealion|defeat of the United Kingdom]] and [[victory of Nazi Germany]] appeared likely. Germany's military successes strengthened its negotiating position against the Slovaks.{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|p=243}}{{sfn|T\u00f6nsmeyer|2003|p=64}} Germany sought to use the favorable conditions to deepen its [[sphere of influence]] in the [[Danube]] region and force its allies in the area into a closer relationship. Shortly before the summit, Hitler had met with Hungarian officials on 10 July, and with Romanian and Bulgarian officials on the two nights immediately preceding the Salzburg meeting.{{sfn|T\u00f6nsmeyer|2003|p=64}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Demands==\n\nIn mid-July 1940, Fuhrer [[Adolf Hitler]] invited Tiso, Tuka, and Mach to a summit held in Salzburg. The ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' wanted \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd to be invited, so that it could thwart any attempts by the latter to escape losing power.{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|p=245}}\n\nOn 28 July, Tiso first met privately with German foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], who informed the Slovaks that Germany considered Slovakia within its ''[[Lebensraum]]'', and therefore justified interference in Slovakia's internal affairs. He demanded that Tiso renounce his goal of a Catholic clerical state and dismiss  \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd, due to the latter's \"register of sins\"\u2014he had attempted to maintain communication with the Western powers and keep friendly relations with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Jel\u00ednek|1971|pp=245\u2013246}}{{sfn|Ward|2013|p=211}} In another meeting, [[Adolf Hitler]] hinted that failure to comply would leave the Slovak State at the mercy of Hungary, by revoking the protection guarantees that Slovakia had obtained in the [[German-Slovak treaty of 23 March 1939|1939 German\u2013Slovak treaty]].{{sfn|Ward|2013|pp=211\u2013212}}{{sfn|Piahanau|2012|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nThe Slovaks requested a revision of the First Vienna Award.{{sfn|Ward|2013|p=212}} Specifically, they wanted six former districts to be returned to Slovakia: [[Vr\u00e1ble]]-[[\u0160urany]], [[Lu\u010denec]],  [[Jel\u0161ava]],  [[Ko\u0161ice]],  north [[S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely]]  and [[Sobrance District]]\u2014{{convert|3600|km2}}.
