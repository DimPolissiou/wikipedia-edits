It lies {{convert|3.7|mi|km|1}} east of [[Barrhead]], {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1}} east-southeast of [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] and {{convert|5.3|mi|km|1}} northwest of [[East Kilbride]], at the southwest of the [[Greater Glasgow|Greater Glasgow conurbation]]. Giffnock is mentioned in documents as early as the seventeenth century as a scattered agricultural settlement. In the late eighteenth century, [[Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton|Archibald Montgomerie]], the [[Earl of Eglinton]], was forced to partition the land into a number of smaller properties.\n\nThe urbanisation and development of Giffnock began in the mid to late nineteenth century with the construction of several sandstone [[Quarry|quarries]], and this prompted the development of the first railway link with nearby Glasgow. Large-scale quarrying continued in Giffnock for almost a century. However, the quarrying ceased by the 1920s, and other uses were found for the quarries. An additional railway service began at the start of the twentieth century, closely followed by the arrival of [[Glasgow Corporation Tramways]]. Giffnock's relative closeness to Glasgow coupled with the local industry and good transports links helped it to develop into a suburban town, as many wealthy merchants chose to construct villas in its smog-free environs and commute daily to the city. \n \nAlthough heavy industry died out in the area during the early twentieth century, as part of Scotland's densely populated [[Central Belt]], Giffnock has continued to grow as a [[Commuter town|dormitory town]], supported by its position within the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents in the early twentieth century to 16,178 in 2001. Expansion continues due to several new housing developments; however, much of the land is now urbanised or designated [[park]]land, leaving little room for further expansion.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] name for Giffnock is Giofnag<ref name=GaelicName>{{cite web|title=Giffnock|url=http://www.gaelicplacenames.org/databasedetails.php?id=383|work=Gaelic Place-names of Scotland|accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> and is of partially [[Common Brittonic|Brythonic]] and [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] origin. 'Cefn' (i.e. 'Giff') comes from the Brythonic meaning 'ridge' and the Gaelic ''cnoc'' (i.e. 'nock') meaning \"hill\". In Gaelic, ''oc'' or ''og'' is a [[diminutive]], and thus when added to ''cefn'' gives Giffnock the meaning of \"Little Ridge\".<ref name=STS2/>\n\nThe first written mention of Giffnock came in 1530, when [[James V of Scotland|James V]] presented Rockend (Ruken) Mill and the surrounding lands to [[Hugh Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Eglinton]].<ref name=CAA/>\nThe settlement of Giffnock first appeared as Gisnock, in an atlas created by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[cartographer]] [[Joan Blaeu]] in 1654, the first atlas of Scotland.<ref name=STS2>{{cite book|title=Sandstone to suburbia : a history of Giffnock.|year=1988|publisher=Eastwood District Libraries|location=[Eastwood]|isbn=1-871215-00-5|page=2}}</ref> Giffnock was primarily a scattered farming community until the late 1780s, when [[Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton]] was forced to partition the land into a number of small properties for sale to raise finances.<ref name=BBCGiffnock>{{cite web|title=BBC Scotland \u2013 Giffnock (East Renfrewshire)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/landscapes/giffnock/|work=landscapes|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Industry===\nIn 1835, the first [[sandstone]] [[quarry]] in Giffnock opened. Before long, the town became known for this industry, and at its peak, there were four quarries in Giffnock, three surface quarries and one underground quarry, which together employed over 1,000 men.<ref name=CAA/><ref name=Quarries>{{cite web|title=Quarries \u2013 Portal to the Past|url=http://www.portaltothepast.co.uk/index.aspx?articleid=3210|work=Portal to the Past|accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> The quarries produced two types of sandstone: \"liver rock\" and \"moor rock\". \"Liver rock\" was particularly popular with masons thanks to its lack of [[Stratum|stratification]], which made the stone easy to work with. In 1854, a coal mining firm managed by civil engineers [[Hugh Baird (engineer)|Hugh Baird]] and [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]] took over the running of the quarries and by 1866 the [[Glasgow South Western Line|Busby Railway]] was built, allowing them to transport the stone by rail.<ref name=Quarries/><ref>{{cite web|title=Busby Railway|url=http://www.railbrit.co.uk/Busby_Railway/frame.htm|work=RailBrit|publisher=RailBrit|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref>  Originally, a lower level line was laid from [[Giffnock railway station]] into the Orchard Quarry to facilitate the extraction of the stone.<ref name=STS5>{{cite book|title=Sandstone to suburbia : a history of Giffnock.|year=1988|publisher=Eastwood District Libraries|location=[Eastwood]|isbn=1-871215-00-5|page=5}}</ref>\n\nSandstone from the Giffnock quarries was primarily used within the nearby city of [[Glasgow]] and can be found in older parts of the [[University of Glasgow]] and the interior of [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery]].<ref name=Quarries/> A small amount of trade was done with Belfast, and some of the finer \"liver rock\" was even transported as far as America and South Africa to build both buildings and monuments.<ref name=STS5/>\n\nQuarrying in Giffnock continued until 1912 when, due to flooding and the high cost of extracting stone, work ceased. Numerous ventures tried to revitalise the quarries for other purposes, including the cultivation of [[mushroom]]s in the tunnels. As the pits began to fill with water, it became an issue that needed to be resolved. In the early 1930s, [[William Beardmore and Company|William Bearmore & Co]] began tipping [[slag]] from the production of steel into the Giffnock quarries.<ref name=STS6>{{cite book|title=Sandstone to suburbia : a history of Giffnock.|year=1988|publisher=Eastwood District Libraries|location=[Eastwood]|isbn=1-871215-00-5|page=6}}</ref> The slag tipping continued until 1969, when Derek Crouch Limited began scrap metal extraction, which lasted until the late 1970s.

It lies {{convert|3.7|mi|km|1}} east of [[Barrhead]], {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1}} east-southeast of [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] and {{convert|5.3|mi|km|1}} northwest of [[East Kilbride]], at the southwest of the [[Greater Glasgow|Greater Glasgow conurbation]]. Giffnock is mentioned in documents as early as the seventeenth century as a scattered agricultural settlement. In the late eighteenth century, [[Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton|Archibald Montgomerie]], the [[Earl of Eglinton]], was forced to partition the land into a number of smaller properties.\n\nThe urbanisation and development of Giffnock began in the mid to late nineteenth century with the construction of several sandstone [[Quarry|quarries]], and this prompted the development of the first railway link with nearby Glasgow. Large-scale quarrying continued in Giffnock for almost a century. However, the quarrying ceased by the 1920s, and other uses were found for the quarries. An additional railway service began at the start of the twentieth century, closely followed by the arrival of [[Glasgow Corporation Tramways]]. Giffnock's relative closeness to Glasgow coupled with the local industry and good transports links helped it to develop into a suburban town, as many wealthy merchants chose to construct villas in its smog-free environs and commute daily to the city. \n \nAlthough heavy industry died out in the area during the early twentieth century, as part of Scotland's densely populated [[Central Belt]], Giffnock has continued to grow as a [[Commuter town|dormitory town]], supported by its position within the Greater Glasgow area, from roughly 1,425 residents in the early twentieth century to 16,178 in 2001. Expansion continues due to several new housing developments; however, much of the land is now urbanised or designated [[park]]land, leaving little room for further expansion.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] name for Giffnock is Giofnag<ref name=GaelicName>{{cite web|title=Giffnock|url=http://www.gaelicplacenames.org/databasedetails.php?id=383|work=Gaelic Place-names of Scotland|accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> and is of partially [[Common Brittonic|Brythonic]] and [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] origin. 'Cefn' (i.e. 'Giff') comes from the Brythonic meaning 'ridge' and the Gaelic ''cnoc'' (i.e. 'nock') meaning \"hill\". In Gaelic, ''oc'' or ''og'' is a [[diminutive]], and thus when added to ''cefn'' gives Giffnock the meaning of \"Little Ridge\".<ref name=STS2/>\n\nThe first written mention of Giffnock came in 1530, when [[James V of Scotland|James V]] presented Rockend (Ruken) Mill and the surrounding lands to [[Hugh Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Eglinton]].<ref name=CAA/>\nThe settlement of Giffnock first appeared as Gisnock, in an atlas created by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[cartographer]] [[Joan Blaeu]] in 1654, the first atlas of Scotland.<ref name=STS2>{{cite book|title=Sandstone to suburbia : a history of Giffnock.|year=1988|publisher=Eastwood District Libraries|location=[Eastwood]|isbn=1-871215-00-5|page=2}}</ref> Giffnock was primarily a scattered farming community until the late 1780s, when [[Archibald Montgomerie, 11th Earl of Eglinton]] was forced to partition the land into a number of small properties for sale to raise finances.<ref name=BBCGiffnock>{{cite web|title=BBC Scotland \u2013 Giffnock (East Renfrewshire)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/landscapes/giffnock/|work=landscapes|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Industry===\nIn 1835, the first [[sandstone]] [[quarry]] in Giffnock opened. Before long, the town became known for this industry, and at its peak, there were four quarries in Giffnock, three surface quarries and one underground quarry, which together employed over 1,000 men.<ref name=CAA/><ref name=Quarries>{{cite web|title=Quarries \u2013 Portal to the Past|url=http://www.portaltothepast.co.uk/index.aspx?articleid=3210|work=Portal to the Past|accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> The quarries produced two types of sandstone: \"liver rock\" and \"moor rock\". \"Liver rock\" was particularly popular with masons thanks to its lack of [[Stratum|stratification]], which made the stone easy to work with. In 1854, a coal mining firm managed by civil engineers [[Hugh Baird (engineer)|Hugh Baird]] and [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]] took over the running of the quarries and by 1866 the [[Glasgow South Western Line|Busby Railway]] was built, allowing them to transport the stone by rail.<ref name=Quarries/><ref>{{cite web|title=Busby Railway|url=http://www.railbrit.co.uk/Busby_Railway/frame.htm|work=RailBrit|publisher=RailBrit|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref>  Originally, a lower level line was laid from [[Giffnock railway station]] into the Orchard Quarry to facilitate the extraction of the stone.<ref name=STS5>{{cite book|title=Sandstone to suburbia : a history of Giffnock.|year=1988|publisher=Eastwood District Libraries|location=[Eastwood]|isbn=1-871215-00-5|page=5}}</ref>\n\nSandstone from the Giffnock quarries was primarily used within the nearby city of [[Glasgow]] and can be found in older parts of the [[University of Glasgow]] and the interior of [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery]].<ref name=Quarries/> A small amount of trade was done with Belfast, and some of the finer \"liver rock\" was even transported as far as America and South Africa to build both buildings and monuments.<ref name=STS5/>\n\nQuarrying in Giffnock continued until 1912 when, due to flooding and the high cost of extracting stone, work ceased. Numerous ventures tried to revitalise the quarries for other purposes, including the cultivation of [[mushroom]]s in the tunnels. As the pits began to fill with water, it became an issue that needed to be resolved. In the early 1930s, [[William Beardmore and Company|William Bearmore & Co]] began tipping [[slag]] from the production of steel into the Giffnock quarries.<ref name=STS6>{{cite book|title=Sandstone to suburbia : a history of Giffnock.|year=1988|publisher=Eastwood District Libraries|location=[Eastwood]|isbn=1-871215-00-5|page=6}}</ref> The slag tipping continued until 1969, when Derek Crouch Limited began scrap metal extraction, which lasted until the late 1970s.

Notable figures in Samoan history included the [[Tui Manu'a]] line and Queen [[Salamasina]] (15th century). [[Nafanua]] was a famous woman warrior who was deified in ancient Samoan religion.\n\nContact with Europeans began in the early 18th century. [[Jacob Roggeveen]], a Dutchman, was the first known non-Polynesian to sight the Samoan islands in 1722.

The United States laid its own claim, based on commercial shipping interests in Pearl River in [[Hawaii]] and Pago Pago Bay in [[Eastern Samoa]], and forced alliances, most conspicuously on the islands of [[Tutuila]] and [[Manu'a]] which became [[American Samoa]].\n\nBritain also sent troops to protect British business enterprise, harbour rights, and consulate office. This was followed by an [[Samoan Civil War|eight-year civil war]], during which each of the three powers supplied arms, training and in some cases combat troops to the warring Samoan parties. The [[Samoan crisis]] came to a critical juncture in March 1889 when all three colonial contenders sent warships into Apia harbour, and a larger-scale war seemed imminent. A massive storm on 15 March 1889 damaged or destroyed the warships, ending the military conflict.<ref>{{cite book |author=Stevenson, Robert Louis |title=A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa|year=1892|publisher=BiblioBazaar |isbn=978-1-4264-0754-3|title-link=A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Second Samoan Civil War]] reached a head in 1898 when [[German Empire|Germany]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and the United States were locked in dispute over who should control the [[Samoa Islands]].

Tourism is an expanding sector which now accounts for 25% of GDP. Tourist arrivals have been increasing over the years with more than 100,000 tourists visiting the islands in 2005, up from 70,000 in 1996.\n\nThe Samoan government has called for [[deregulation]] of the financial sector, encouragement of investment, and continued fiscal discipline. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Observers point to the flexibility of the labour market as a basic strength for future economic advances. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The sector has been helped enormously by major capital investment in hotel infrastructure, political instability in neighbouring Pacific countries, and the 2005 launch of [[Virgin Samoa]] a joint-venture between the government and [[Virgin Australia]] (then Virgin Blue).\n\nIn the period before German colonisation, Samoa produced mostly copra. German merchants and settlers were active in introducing large scale [[plantation]] operations and developing new industries, notably, cocoa bean and rubber, relying on imported labourers from China and [[Melanesia]]. When the value of natural rubber fell drastically, about the end of the Great War (World War I), the New Zealand government encouraged the production of bananas, for which there is a large market in New Zealand. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nBecause of variations in altitude, a large range of tropical and subtropical crops can be cultivated, but land is not generally available to outside interests. Of the total land area of 2,934&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (725,000 acres), about 24.4% is in permanent crops and another 21.2% is arable. About 4.4% is Western Samoan Trust Estates Corporation (WSTEC). {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nThe staple products of Samoa are copra (dried coconut meat), [[cocoa bean]] (for chocolate), and bananas. The annual production of both bananas and copra has been in the range of 13,000 to 15,000 metric tons (about 14,500 to 16,500 short tons). If the [[rhinoceros beetle]] in Samoa were eradicated, Samoa could produce in excess of 40,000 metric tons (44,000 short tons) of copra. Samoan cocoa beans are of very high quality and used in fine New Zealand chocolates. Most are [[Criollo (cocoa bean)|Criollo]]-Forastero hybrids. Coffee grows well, but production has been uneven. WSTEC is the biggest coffee producer. Rubber has been produced in Samoa for many years, but its export value has little impact on the economy. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nOther agricultural industries have been less successful. [[Sugarcane]] production, originally established by Germans in the early 20th century, could be successful. Old train tracks for transporting cane can be seen at some plantations east of [[Apia]]. [[Pineapple]]s grow well in Samoa, but beyond local consumption have not been a major export.\n\nSixty percent of Samoa's electricity comes from renewable hydro, solar, and wind sources, with the remainder from diesel generators.

As one of the oldest Polynesian cultures, the fa'asamoa developed over a period of 3,000 years, withstanding centuries of European influence to maintains its historical customs, social and political systems, and [[Samoan language|language]]. Cultural customs such as the [[Samoa 'ava ceremony]] are significant and solemn rituals at important occasions including the bestowal of ''[[fa'amatai|matai]]'' chiefly titles. Items of great cultural value include the finely woven ''[['ie toga]]''.\n\n[[Samoan mythology]] includes many gods with creation stories and figures of legend such as [[Tagaloa]] and the goddess of war [[Nafanua]], the daughter of [[Saveasi'uleo]], ruler of the spirit realm [[Pulotu]]. Other legends include the well known story of [[Sina and the Eel]] which explains the origins of the first coconut tree.\n\nSome Samoans are spiritual and religious, and have subtly adapted the dominant religion of Christianity to 'fit in' with fa'a Samoa and vice versa. Ancient beliefs continue to co-exist side by side with Christianity, particularly in regard to the traditional customs and rituals of fa'a Samoa. The Samoan culture is centred around the principle of v\u0101fealoa'i, the relationships between people. These relationships are based on respect, or [[fa'aaloalo]]. When Christianity was introduced in Samoa, most Samoan people converted. Currently 98% of the population identify themselves as Christian.\n\nSome Samoans live a communal way of life, participating in activities collectively. Examples of this are the traditional Samoan ''[[Architecture of Samoa|fale]]'' (houses) which are open with no walls, using blinds made of coconut palm fronds during the night or bad weather.\n\nThe Samoan ''[[siva Samoa|siva]]'' dance has unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and tells a story, although the Samoan male dances can be more snappy.<ref>{{cite news | title=Dance: Siva | url=http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html | work=Samoa.co.uk | access-date=27 November 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117045520/http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html | archive-date=17 November 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The ''[[sasa (dance)|sasa]]'' is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid [[synchronization|synchronised]] movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums ''([[pate (musical instrument)|pate]])'' or rolled mats.

German merchants and settlers were active in introducing large scale [[plantation]] operations and developing new industries, notably, cocoa bean and rubber, relying on imported labourers from China and [[Melanesia]]. When the value of natural rubber fell drastically, about the end of the Great War (World War I), the New Zealand government encouraged the production of bananas, for which there is a large market in New Zealand. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nBecause of variations in altitude, a large range of tropical and subtropical crops can be cultivated, but land is not generally available to outside interests. Of the total land area of 2,934&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (725,000 acres), about 24.4% is in permanent crops and another 21.2% is arable. About 4.4% is Western Samoan Trust Estates Corporation (WSTEC). {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nThe staple products of Samoa are copra (dried coconut meat), [[cocoa bean]] (for chocolate), and bananas. The annual production of both bananas and copra has been in the range of 13,000 to 15,000 metric tons (about 14,500 to 16,500 short tons). If the [[rhinoceros beetle]] in Samoa were eradicated, Samoa could produce in excess of 40,000 metric tons (44,000 short tons) of copra. Samoan cocoa beans are of very high quality and used in fine New Zealand chocolates. Most are [[Criollo (cocoa bean)|Criollo]]-Forastero hybrids. Coffee grows well, but production has been uneven. WSTEC is the biggest coffee producer. Rubber has been produced in Samoa for many years, but its export value has little impact on the economy. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nOther agricultural industries have been less successful. [[Sugarcane]] production, originally established by Germans in the early 20th century, could be successful. Old train tracks for transporting cane can be seen at some plantations east of [[Apia]].

As one of the oldest Polynesian cultures, the fa'asamoa developed over a period of 3,000 years, withstanding centuries of European influence to maintains its historical customs, social and political systems, and [[Samoan language|language]]. Cultural customs such as the [[Samoa 'ava ceremony]] are significant and solemn rituals at important occasions including the bestowal of ''[[fa'amatai|matai]]'' chiefly titles. Items of great cultural value include the finely woven ''[['ie toga]]''.\n\n[[Samoan mythology]] includes many gods with creation stories and figures of legend such as [[Tagaloa]] and the goddess of war [[Nafanua]], the daughter of [[Saveasi'uleo]], ruler of the spirit realm [[Pulotu]]. Other legends include the well known story of [[Sina and the Eel]] which explains the origins of the first coconut tree.\n\nSome Samoans are spiritual and religious, and have subtly adapted the dominant religion of Christianity to 'fit in' with fa'a Samoa and vice versa. Ancient beliefs continue to co-exist side by side with Christianity, particularly in regard to the traditional customs and rituals of fa'a Samoa. The Samoan culture is centred around the principle of v\u0101fealoa'i, the relationships between people. These relationships are based on respect, or [[fa'aaloalo]]. When Christianity was introduced in Samoa, most Samoan people converted. Currently 98% of the population identify themselves as Christian.\n\nSome Samoans live a communal way of life, participating in activities collectively. Examples of this are the traditional Samoan ''[[Architecture of Samoa|fale]]'' (houses) which are open with no walls, using blinds made of coconut palm fronds during the night or bad weather.\n\nThe Samoan ''[[siva Samoa|siva]]'' dance has unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and tells a story, although the Samoan male dances can be more snappy.<ref>{{cite news | title=Dance: Siva | url=http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html | work=Samoa.co.uk | access-date=27 November 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117045520/http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html | archive-date=17 November 2007 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The ''[[sasa (dance)|sasa]]'' is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid [[synchronization|synchronised]] movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums ''([[pate (musical instrument)|pate]])'' or rolled mats.

{"title_page": "Conway's Soldiers", "text_new": "'''Conway's Soldiers''' or the '''checker-jumping problem''' is a one-person [[mathematical game]] or puzzle devised and analyzed by mathematician [[John Horton Conway]] in 1961. A variant of [[peg solitaire]], it takes place on an [[infinity|infinite]] checkerboard. The board is divided by a horizontal line that extends indefinitely. Above the line are empty cells and below the line are an arbitrary number of game pieces, or \"soldiers\". As in peg solitaire, a move consists of one soldier jumping over an adjacent soldier into an empty cell, vertically or horizontally (but not diagonally), and removing the soldier which was jumped over.  The goal of the puzzle is to place a soldier as far above the horizontal line as possible.\n\n[[Image:Conway's soldiers.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Arrangements of Conway's soldiers to reach rows 1, 2, 3 and 4. The men marked \"B\" represent an alternative to those marked \"A\".]]\nConway proved that, regardless of the strategy used, there is no finite series of moves that will allow a soldier to advance more than four rows above the horizontal line.  His argument uses a carefully chosen weighting of cells (involving the [[golden ratio]]), and he proved that the total weight can only decrease or remain constant.  This argument has been reproduced in a number of popular math books.\n\n[[Simon Tatham]] and Gareth Taylor have shown that the fifth row can be reached via an ''infinite'' series of moves;<ref>{{cite web |title=Reaching row 5 in Solitaire Army |url=http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/solarmy/ |website=www.chiark.greenend.org.uk}}</ref> this result is also in a paper by Pieter Blue and Stephen Hartke.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.math.unl.edu/~shartke2/}}</ref>  If diagonal jumps are allowed, the 8th row can be reached but not the 9th row.  It has also been shown that, in the ''n''-[[dimensional]] version of the game, the highest row that can be reached is 3''n''-2.  Conway's weighting argument demonstrates that the row 3''n''-1 cannot be reached.  It is considerably harder to show that row 3''n''-2 can be reached (see the paper by Eriksson and Lindstrom).\n\n==Proof that the fifth row is inaccessible==\n\n===Notation and definitions===\n\nLet the target square be labeled <math>{x^0 =1}</math>, and all other squares be labeled <math>{x^n}</math>, where <math>{n}</math> is the number of squares away (horizontally and vertically, as in [[manhattan distance]]) from the target square. If we consider the starting configuration of soldiers, below the thick red line, we can assign a score based on the sum of the values under each soldier, (e.g., <math>{x^2 + 2x^3}</math> etc.) When a soldier jumps over another soldier, there are three cases to consider: \n\n# A Positive jump: this is when a soldier jumps '''towards''' the target square over another soldier. Let the value of the soldier's square be <math>{x^n}</math>, then the total change in score after a positive jump is <math>{x^{n-2} -x^{n-1} -x^n = x^{n-2}(1 -x -x^2)}</math>.\n# A Neutral jump; this is when a soldier jumps over another soldier but remains an equal distance from the target square after his jump (should this be necessary). In this case the change in score is <math>{-x^{n-1}}</math>.\n# A Negative jump: this is when a soldiers jumps over another into an empty square '''away''' from the target square. Here the change in score is <math>{x^{n+2} -x^{n+1} -x^{n} = x^{n}(x^{2} -x -1)}</math>.\n\n===Choosing a value of <math>x</math>===\n\nLet us choose a value of <math>x</math> such that the change in score for any type of jump is never positive. This can be done by solving <math>{x^2 +x -1 = 0}</math> yielding <math>{x =\\frac{\\sqrt{5} -1}{2}, \\frac{-\\sqrt{5} -1}{2}}</math>. We choose the positive root, <math>{\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2} = \\varphi \\approx 0.61803\\,39887\\dots\\,}</math>, as its absolute value is less than 1, which becomes useful later in the proof. Rearranging <math>{\\varphi^2 +\\varphi -1 = 0}</math>, we can see that:\n\n<math>{\\varphi^2 = 1 - \\varphi}</math> [and multiplying by <math>{\\varphi}</math>;] \n\n<math>{\\varphi^3 = \\varphi - \\varphi^2}</math>\n\n<math>{\\varphi^4 = \\varphi^2 - \\varphi^3}</math> \n\netc... \n\nSumming this to infinity causes all terms on the right hand side to cancel apart from the 1, i.e., \n\n<math>{\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty}\\varphi^n = 1}</math>\n\n'''This can also be shown with the common ratio, where:'''\n\n<math> \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty r^{k} = \\frac{1}{1-r}</math>  \n<math>(r<1)</math>\n\nWhen r = <math>\\varphi:</math> \n\n<math> \\sum_{k=2}^\\infty \\varphi^{k} = \\frac{1}{1-\\varphi} - \\varphi - 1= 1</math>\n\n===Solutions===\n\nLet us take the first example, where the target square is in the first row above the red line. We now consider the maximum possible initial score, that is when every square has a soldier on it. The sum of the squares on the first row below the red line, is <math>{\\varphi +2\\varphi^2 +2\\varphi^3 + \\ldots = \\varphi +2(\\varphi^2 +\\varphi^3 + \\varphi^4 + \\ldots)}</math>. [Drawing a diagram helps to visualise this]. In the next line down, every square is one further away from the target square, and so has value <math>\\varphi</math> times the square above it, and so on for all the rows below the line. \n\nTherefore, the total value of all the squares below the line is equal to: \n\n<math>{{S}_1=(\\varphi +2(\\varphi^2 +\\varphi^3 + \\varphi^4 \\ldots))(1 +\\varphi + \\varphi^2 + \\varphi^3 + \\ldots)}</math>.\n\nAt this stage we observe that <math>\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty}\\varphi^n = 1</math> from above, and thus the above expression simplifies to:\n\n<math>{{S}_1=(\\varphi + 2)(1 + \\varphi + 1) = (\\varphi + 2)^2 = 4 + 4\\varphi + \\varphi^2 = 5 + 3\\varphi}</math>, using <math>{\\varphi^2 = 1 - \\varphi}</math> for the last step. \n\nTherefore the sum of all the squares below the line when the target square is immediately above the line is <math>{5 + 3\\varphi}</math>.\n\nThe next case we consider is when the target square is in the second row above the red line. In this case each square under the red line is one square further away from the target square than in the previous example, so the total score now is found by multiplying the total score we obtained by <math>{\\varphi}</math> to give:\n\n<math>{{S}_2=\\varphi(5 + 3\\varphi) = 5\\varphi + 3\\varphi^2 = 5\\varphi + 3(1 - \\varphi) = 3 + 2\\varphi }</math>.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n<math>{{S}_3 = 2 + \\varphi }</math>\n\n<math>{{S}_4 = 1 + \\varphi }</math>\n\n'''<math>{{S}_5 = 1 }</math>'''\n\nThus, we have shown that when the target square is five rows above the red line, the maximum possible original total score of all the soldiers is 1. With a finite number of soldiers the total will be less than one. Therefore, since any type of jump does not increase the total score, and the final score on all the soldiers must be at least 1  (<math>{\\varphi^0 = 1}</math> and the scores on any other soldiers left), the fifth row cannot be reached with a finite number of soldiers originally below the line.\n\nThis completes the proof. \n\n<math>{{QED}}</math>.\n\n==References==\n\n* E.

Let the value of the soldier's square be <math>{x^n}</math>, then the total change in score after a positive jump is <math>{x^{n-2} -x^{n-1} -x^n = x^{n-2}(1 -x -x^2)}</math>.\n# A Neutral jump; this is when a soldier jumps over another soldier but remains an equal distance from the target square after his jump (should this be necessary). In this case the change in score is <math>{-x^{n-1}}</math>.\n# A Negative jump: this is when a soldiers jumps over another into an empty square '''away''' from the target square. Here the change in score is <math>{x^{n+2} -x^{n+1} -x^{n} = x^{n}(x^{2} -x -1)}</math>.\n\n===Choosing a value of <math>x</math>===\n\nLet us choose a value of <math>x</math> such that the change in score for any type of jump is never positive. This can be done by solving <math>{x^2 +x -1 = 0}</math> yielding <math>{x =\\frac{\\sqrt{5} -1}{2}, \\frac{-\\sqrt{5} -1}{2}}</math>. We choose the positive root, <math>{\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2} = \\varphi \\approx 0.61803\\,39887\\dots\\,}</math>, as its absolute value is less than 1, which becomes useful later in the proof. Rearranging <math>{\\varphi^2 +\\varphi -1 = 0}</math>, we can see that:\n\n<math>{\\varphi^2 = 1 - \\varphi}</math> [and multiplying by <math>{\\varphi}</math>;] \n\n<math>{\\varphi^3 = \\varphi - \\varphi^2}</math>\n\n<math>{\\varphi^4 = \\varphi^2 - \\varphi^3}</math> \n\netc... \n\nSumming this to infinity causes all terms on the right hand side to cancel apart from the 1, i.e., \n\n<math>{\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty}\\varphi^n = 1}</math>\n\n'''This can also be shown with the common ratio, where:'''\n\n<math> \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty r^{k} = \\frac{1}{1-r}</math>  \n<math>(r<1)</math>\n\nWhen r = <math>\\varphi:</math> \n\n<math> \\sum_{k=2}^\\infty \\varphi^{k} = \\frac{1}{1-\\varphi} - \\varphi - 1= 1</math>\n\n===Solutions===\n\nLet us take the first example, where the target square is in the first row above the red line. We now consider the maximum possible initial score, that is when every square has a soldier on it. The sum of the squares on the first row below the red line, is <math>{\\varphi +2\\varphi^2 +2\\varphi^3 + \\ldots = \\varphi +2(\\varphi^2 +\\varphi^3 + \\varphi^4 + \\ldots)}</math>. [Drawing a diagram helps to visualise this]. In the next line down, every square is one further away from the target square, and so has value <math>\\varphi</math> times the square above it, and so on for all the rows below the line. \n\nTherefore, the total value of all the squares below the line is equal to: \n\n<math>{{S}_1=(\\varphi +2(\\varphi^2 +\\varphi^3 + \\varphi^4 \\ldots))(1 +\\varphi + \\varphi^2 + \\varphi^3 + \\ldots)}</math>.\n\nAt this stage we observe that <math>\\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty}\\varphi^n = 1</math> from above, and thus the above expression simplifies to:\n\n<math>{{S}_1=(\\varphi + 2)(1 + \\varphi + 1) = (\\varphi + 2)^2 = 4 + 4\\varphi + \\varphi^2 = 5 + 3\\varphi}</math>, using <math>{\\varphi^2 = 1 - \\varphi}</math> for the last step. \n\nTherefore the sum of all the squares below the line when the target square is immediately above the line is <math>{5 + 3\\varphi}</math>.\n\nThe next case we consider is when the target square is in the second row above the red line. In this case each square under the red line is one square further away from the target square than in the previous example, so the total score now is found by multiplying the total score we obtained by <math>{\\varphi}</math> to give:\n\n<math>{{S}_2=\\varphi(5 + 3\\varphi) = 5\\varphi + 3\\varphi^2 = 5\\varphi + 3(1 - \\varphi) = 3 + 2\\varphi }</math>.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n<math>{{S}_3 = 2 + \\varphi }</math>\n\n<math>{{S}_4 = 1 + \\varphi }</math>\n\n'''<math>{{S}_5 = 1 }</math>'''\n\nThus, we have shown that when the target square is five rows above the red line, the maximum possible original total score of all the soldiers is 1. With a finite number of soldiers the total will be less than one. Therefore, since any type of jump does not increase the total score, and the final score on all the soldiers must be at least 1  (<math>{\\varphi^0 = 1}</math> and the scores on any other soldiers left), the fifth row cannot be reached with a finite number of soldiers originally below the line.\n\nThis completes the proof. \n\n<math>{{QED}}</math>.\n\n==References==\n\n* E.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\n[[File:Covid 19 new cases and deaths China showing Hubei lockdown.png|thumb|325px|Semi-log graph of new cases and deaths in China during Covid-19 epidemic showing the lockdown and lifting]]\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\n[[File:Covid 19 new cases and deaths China showing Hubei lockdown.png|thumb|325px|Semi-log graph of new cases and deaths in China during Covid-19 epidemic showing the lockdown and lifting]]\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

As the island became settled in the 1860s and 1870s, this ambiguity led to increasing friction between settlers. Attempts by the Tokugawa shogunate to purchase the entire island from the Russian Empire failed, and the new Meiji government was unable to negotiate a partition of the island into separate territories.\nIn 1875 by the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], Japan agreed to give up its claims on Sakhalin in exchange for undisputed ownership of the Kuril Islands.

It was resolved by arbitration in 1903 with a delegation that included 3 Americans, 2 Canadians, and 1 British delegate that became the swing vote. By a 4 to 2 vote, the final resolution favored the American position. Canada did not get an outlet from the [[Yukon]] gold fields to the sea. The disappointment and anger in Canada was directed less at the United States, and more at the British government for betraying Canadian interests in pursuit of a friendly relationship between Britain and the United States.\n|-\n| [[Aroostook War]]\n| ''{{flag|United States|1896}}''<br />''{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[British North America]]''\n| 1838\n| 1842\n| Disputed border between the state of Maine and the provinces of New Brunswick and [[Lower Canada]].\n|-\n| [[Atacama border dispute]]\n| '''{{BOL}}'''<br />{{CHI}}\n| 1879\n| 1904\n|\n|-\n| [[Gua\u00edra Falls/Sete Quedas]]\n| '''{{BRA}}''' <br />{{PAR}}\n| 1872\n|1980\n| The disputed islands were submerged by the reservoir of Itaip\u00fa.\n|-\n| [[Chamizal dispute]]\n| ''{{flag|United States|1896}}''<br />''{{flag|Mexico|1893}}''\n| 1898\n| 1963\n| Disputed border within the [[El Paso]]/[[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] region.\n|-\n| [[Cresap's War]]\n| ''{{flag|Maryland}}''<br />''{{flag|Pennsylvania}}''\n| 1730\n| 1767\n| Dispute over the northern border of the [[Province of Maryland]] and southern border of [[Province of Pennsylvania]], particularly west of the [[Susquehanna River]].

During 1749\u201364, Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] of New Hampshire issued well over a hundred \"grants\", offering lands for sale west of the river in what would become Vermont. In 1764, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] attempted to end the dispute by ruling that the region belonged to New York. But New York would not recognize the property claims of numerous settlers whose claims were based on Wentworth's grants, so local governments and militias resisted New York's rule. In 1777, the politicians of the disputed territory declared it independent of New York, Britain, and New Hampshire, calling it the State of Vermont. Vermont existed for 14 years as an unrecognized de facto independent country, considered by New York to be a district in rebellion.

At that point, the Norwegian government raised the claim, primarily to use the islands as bargaining chips in negotiations with the [[United Kingdom]] over the status of the Arctic island [[Jan Mayen]] and the Antarctic [[Bouvet Island]].

The \u00c5land movement (\u00c5landsr\u00f6relsen) wanted \u00c5land to reunite with its old mother country Sweden (Finland and \u00c5land belonged to Sweden before 1809). The movement gathered signatures from over 7000 inhabitants of legal age at the \u00c5land Islands in 1917 (that was about 96% of the population) - they all supported a union with Sweden. When [[Independence of Finland|Finland became independent]] (December 6, 1917) Sweden wanted a plebiscite about the future of the \u00c5land Islands to solve the problem. Finland refused and argued that the \u00c5land Islands had always been a natural part of Finland - even when Finland was under Swedish rule. Sweden appealed to the [[League of Nations]] referring to the right of the population to determine which country they should belong to. After studying the matter closely the League of Nations decided Finland should retain sovereignty over the province but that the \u00c5land Islands should be made an autonomous territory. The Swedish Prime Minister said he didn't accept the verdict but he also said that Sweden was not going to use military force to get their claims.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html|website = MacGregor is History |title = Disputes in the League of Nations in the 1920's|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120616144657/http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html|archive-date = 16 June 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Graham Island (Mediterranean Sea)|Graham Island]]\n| '''{{flag|Two Sicilies}}'''<br />{{flagicon|Malta|1814}} [[Malta Colony|Malta]]<br />{{flag|France}}<br />{{flag|Spain|1785}}\n| 1831\n| 1831\n|A dispute between the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the British Crown Colony of Malta, the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Spain occurred after the volcanic island appeared in 1831.

As the island became settled in the 1860s and 1870s, this ambiguity led to increasing friction between settlers. Attempts by the Tokugawa shogunate to purchase the entire island from the Russian Empire failed, and the new Meiji government was unable to negotiate a partition of the island into separate territories.\nIn 1875 by the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], Japan agreed to give up its claims on Sakhalin in exchange for undisputed ownership of the Kuril Islands.

It was resolved by arbitration in 1903 with a delegation that included 3 Americans, 2 Canadians, and 1 British delegate that became the swing vote. By a 4 to 2 vote, the final resolution favored the American position. Canada did not get an outlet from the [[Yukon]] gold fields to the sea.

During 1749\u201364, Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] of New Hampshire issued well over a hundred \"grants\", offering lands for sale west of the river in what would become Vermont. In 1764, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] attempted to end the dispute by ruling that the region belonged to New York. But New York would not recognize the property claims of numerous settlers whose claims were based on Wentworth's grants, so local governments and militias resisted New York's rule. In 1777, the politicians of the disputed territory declared it independent of New York, Britain, and New Hampshire, calling it the State of Vermont. Vermont existed for 14 years as an unrecognized de facto independent country, considered by New York to be a district in rebellion.

The \u00c5land movement (\u00c5landsr\u00f6relsen) wanted \u00c5land to reunite with its old mother country Sweden (Finland and \u00c5land belonged to Sweden before 1809). The movement gathered signatures from over 7000 inhabitants of legal age at the \u00c5land Islands in 1917 (that was about 96% of the population) - they all supported a union with Sweden. When [[Independence of Finland|Finland became independent]] (December 6, 1917) Sweden wanted a plebiscite about the future of the \u00c5land Islands to solve the problem. Finland refused and argued that the \u00c5land Islands had always been a natural part of Finland - even when Finland was under Swedish rule. Sweden appealed to the [[League of Nations]] referring to the right of the population to determine which country they should belong to. After studying the matter closely the League of Nations decided Finland should retain sovereignty over the province but that the \u00c5land Islands should be made an autonomous territory. The Swedish Prime Minister said he didn't accept the verdict but he also said that Sweden was not going to use military force to get their claims.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html|website = MacGregor is History |title = Disputes in the League of Nations in the 1920's|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120616144657/http://www.macgregorishistory.com/english/ib/League%20of%20Nations/lon1920.html|archive-date = 16 June 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Graham Island (Mediterranean Sea)|Graham Island]]\n| '''{{flag|Two Sicilies}}'''<br />{{flagicon|Malta|1814}} [[Malta Colony|Malta]]<br />{{flag|France}}<br />{{flag|Spain|1785}}\n| 1831\n| 1831\n|A dispute between the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the British Crown Colony of Malta, the Kingdom of France and the Kingdom of Spain occurred after the volcanic island appeared in 1831.

They are best known for their million-selling instrumental track \"[[Pick Up the Pieces (Average White Band song)|Pick Up the Pieces]]\", and their albums ''[[AWB (album)|AWB]]'' and ''[[Cut the Cake (album)|Cut the Cake]]''. The band name was initially proposed by [[Bonnie Bramlett]].

McIntyre and McIntosh were used as [[session musician]]s on [[Chuck Berry]]'s recording of \"[[My Ding-a-Ling]]\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nAccording to Duncan, members of the band had played together before in Scotland, but had moved to London separately and met up by chance at a [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] concert.  They decided to jam together; a friend heard them and remarked: \"This is too much for the average white man,\" which became adapted as the name of the band.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/14/average-white-band-how-we-made-pick-up-the-pieces-interview |title=Average White Band: how we made Pick Up the Pieces |first= Dave |last=Simpson |date=14 August 2017 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\n===Breakthrough===\nThe band's breakthrough was a support slot at [[Eric Clapton]]'s comeback concert in 1973.

''Cut the Cake'' was dedicated by the surviving band members to McIntosh's memory. A double live album \"Person To Person\" was issued in late 1976. Their next LP, ''Benny & Us'', was a collaboration with [[Ben E.

Hamish Stuart joined [[Paul McCartney]]'s touring group.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1985 Gorrie released a solo album, ''Sleepless Nights''.\n\nThe classic lineup of Gorrie, McIntyre, Ball, Stuart, Duncan and Ferrone reunited for one last time at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary in 1988. Gorrie, McIntyre, and Ball then continued in 1989 to record ''[[Aftershock (Average White Band album)|Aftershock]]''. [[Alex Ligertwood]] (ex-[[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Jeff Beck Group]] and another veteran of Brian Auger's Oblivion Express) also appeared on this album, replacing lead singer Hamish Stuart, along with Eliot Lewis who co-wrote with Gorrie and joined the band. Ligertwood left after the album's recording and drummer Tiger McNeil joined for the reunited band's live shows. McNeil was with the group until 1994. He was then succeeded by Peter Abbott (ex-[[Blood, Sweat & Tears]]), who in turn was replaced by Fred \"Catfish\" Alias in September 1998. Drummer [[Adam Deitch]] did a two-year stint with AWB from 1999 to 2001.\n\nAverage White Band has continued recording (1997's ''Soul Tattoo'', 1999's ''Face to Face'') and touring since. Ball worked on ''Soul Tattoo'' with the group but was replaced by Fred Vigdor (aka Freddy V.) in 1996.\n\nBrian Dunne took over the drum chair in 2001 and when Eliot Lewis left the band in September 2002 to pursue other musical opportunities (including a stint with [[Hall and Oates]]), he was replaced by Klyde Jones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.averagewhiteband.com |title=Averagewhiteband.com |publisher=Averagewhiteband.com |accessdate=17 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718152311/http://www.averagewhiteband.com/| archivedate= 18 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nTheir line-up as of 2002 became Alan Gorrie (bass guitar, guitar, lead and backing vocals), Klyde Jones (keyboards, bass guitar, guitar, lead and backing vocals), Onnie McIntyre (guitar, vocals), Freddy V (sax, keyboards, vocals), and Brian Dunne (drums).\n\nDunne was replaced by Rocky Bryant as drummer as of the 2006 tour. After Jones left in 2011 to join Hall and Oates, Monte Croft (keyboards, bass, guitar) and former [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] member [[Morris Pleasure]] (keyboards, bass, guitar) came in to do brief stints before Rob Aries arrived in 2013.\n\nBrent Carter (ex-[[Tower of Power]]) has been singing with AWB since 2011.\n\nIn July 2015, Malcolm \u2018Molly\u2019 Duncan, Steve Ferrone and Hamish Stuart reunited to form The 360 Band. This is in essence one half of the original AWB. They released an album titled \"Three Sixty\" in 2017 and have been performing live together along with supporting musicians. \nAs of 2019, Alan Gorrie and Onnie McIntyre are the only two original members left in the Average White Band.\n\nOn 25 June 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Average White Band among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the

They are best known for their million-selling instrumental track \"[[Pick Up the Pieces (Average White Band song)|Pick Up the Pieces]]\", and their albums ''[[AWB (album)|AWB]]'' and ''[[Cut the Cake (album)|Cut the Cake]]''. The band name was initially proposed by [[Bonnie Bramlett]]. They have influenced others, such as the [[Brand New Heavies]], and been [[sampling (music)|sampled]] by various musicians, including the [[Beastie Boys]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], [[The Beatnuts]], [[Too Short]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[Nas]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Christina Milian]], and [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]]<ref name=\"Rockopedia\"/>, making them the 15th most sampled act in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/714/alan_gorrie_awb_everybody_be_cool_real |title=Average White Band interview by Pete Lewis, 'Blues & Soul' August 2011 |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |date= |accessdate=22 October 2011}}</ref> As of 2018, 46 years after their formation, they continue to perform.\n\n==Career==\n===Formation===\nAWB was formed in early 1972<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book\n| first = Martin C.\n| last = Strong\n| year = 2000\n| title = The Great Rock Discography\n| edition = 5th\n| publisher = Mojo Books\n| location = Edinburgh\n| pages = 36\u201337\n| isbn = 1-84195-017-3}}</ref> in London by [[Alan Gorrie]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst752.html |title=Alan Gorrie |publisher=Scottish-places.info |date= |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> and [[Molly Duncan|Malcolm \"Molly\" Duncan]], with Owen \"Onnie\" McIntyre,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst2298.html |title=Owen (Onnie) McIntyre |publisher=Scottish-places.info |date= |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> Michael Rosen (trumpet), [[Roger Ball (musician)|Roger Ball]], and [[Robbie McIntosh (drummer)|Robbie McIntosh]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst2301.html |title=Robert (Robbie) McIntosh 1950 \u2013 1974 |publisher=Scottish-places.info |date= |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> joining them in the original line-up.

Gorrie and McIntyre had been members of [[Forever More (band)|Forever More]]. McIntyre and McIntosh were used as [[session musician]]s on [[Chuck Berry]]'s recording of \"[[My Ding-a-Ling]]\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nAccording to Duncan, members of the band had played together before in Scotland, but had moved to London separately and met up by chance at a [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] concert.  They decided to jam together; a friend heard them and remarked: \"This is too much for the average white man,\" which became adapted as the name of the band.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/14/average-white-band-how-we-made-pick-up-the-pieces-interview |title=Average White Band: how we made Pick Up the Pieces |first= Dave |last=Simpson |date=14 August 2017 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\n===Breakthrough===\nThe band's breakthrough was a support slot at [[Eric Clapton]]'s comeback concert in 1973.

He borrowed money to take them to the US and to [[Promoter (entertainment)|promote]] them. McCaskill had many contacts from his days with Clapton and managed to get [[Atlantic Records]] to sign them. The band relocated to Los Angeles and released the follow-up, ''[[AWB (album)|AWB]]'', better known as ''The White Album''.

The song knocked Linda Ronstadt's \"You're No Good\" out of No. 1 and sold over one million copies.

It was both a tribute to AWB's knowledge of funk and a tongue-in-cheek play on the Scottish band's name.\n\nAWB followed up with the [[Gramophone record|LP]]s ''[[Cut the Cake (album)|Cut the Cake]]'' (1975) and ''[[Soul Searching (Average White Band album)|Soul Searching]]'' (1976), both big sellers and yielding further [[Top 40]] singles. ''Cut the Cake'' was dedicated by the surviving band members to McIntosh's memory. A double live album \"Person To Person\" was issued in late 1976. Their next LP, ''Benny & Us'', was a collaboration with [[Ben E. King]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n===Later career===\nAfter several more albums, \"Warmer Communications\" (1978), \"Feel No Fret\" (1979) and after a switch to the U.S. Arista label, \"Shine\" (1980) and \"Cupid's In Fashion\" (1982), AWB's audience and sales dwindled. The group initially disbanded by 1983.

Hamish Stuart joined [[Paul McCartney]]'s touring group.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In 1985 Gorrie released a solo album, ''Sleepless Nights''.\n\nThe classic lineup of Gorrie, McIntyre, Ball, Stuart, Duncan and Ferrone reunited for one last time at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary in 1988. Gorrie, McIntyre, and Ball then continued in 1989 to record ''[[Aftershock (Average White Band album)|Aftershock]]''. [[Alex Ligertwood]] (ex-[[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Jeff Beck Group]] and another veteran of Brian Auger's Oblivion Express) also appeared on this album, replacing lead singer Hamish Stuart, along with Eliot Lewis who co-wrote with Gorrie and joined the band. Ligertwood left after the album's recording and drummer Tiger McNeil joined for the reunited band's live shows. McNeil was with the group until 1994. He was then succeeded by Peter Abbott (ex-[[Blood, Sweat and Tears]]), who in turn was replaced by Fred \"Catfish\" Alias in September 1998. Drummer [[Adam Deitch]] did a two-year stint with AWB from 1999 to 2001.\n\nAverage White Band has continued recording (1997's ''Soul Tattoo'', 1999's ''Face to Face'') and touring since. Ball worked on ''Soul Tattoo'' with the group but was replaced by Fred Vigdor (aka Freddy V.) in 1996.\n\nBrian Dunne took over the drum chair in 2001 and when Eliot Lewis left the band in September 2002 to pursue other musical opportunities (including a stint with [[Hall and Oates]]), he was replaced by Klyde Jones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.averagewhiteband.com |title=Averagewhiteband.com |publisher=Averagewhiteband.com |accessdate=17 August 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718152311/http://www.averagewhiteband.com/| archivedate= 18 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nTheir line-up as of 2002 became Alan Gorrie (bass guitar, guitar, lead and backing vocals), Klyde Jones (keyboards, bass guitar, guitar, lead and backing vocals), Onnie McIntyre (guitar, vocals), Freddy V (sax, keyboards, vocals), and Brian Dunne (drums).\n\nDunne was replaced by Rocky Bryant as drummer as of the 2006 tour. After Jones left in 2011 to join Hall and Oates, Monte Croft (keyboards, bass, guitar) and former [[Earth Wind and Fire]] member [[Morris Pleasure]] (keyboards, bass, guitar) came in to do brief stints before Rob Aries arrived in 2013.\n\nBrent Carter (ex-[[Tower of Power]]) has been singing with AWB since 2011.\n\nIn July 2015, Malcolm \u2018Molly\u2019 Duncan, Steve Ferrone and Hamish Stuart reunited to form The 360 Band. This is in essence one half of the original AWB. They released an album titled \"Three Sixty\" in 2017 and have been performing live together along with supporting musicians. \nAs of 2019, Alan Gorrie and Onnie McIntyre are the only two original members left in the Average White Band.\n\nOn 25 June 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Average White Band among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the

It's liquid engineering.\" In 2008, this slogan was also being featured as the name for a new rewards club called the \"[[Castrol Liquid Engineering Crew]]\" in which members get the chance to win prizes.\n\nFor many years, the opening notes of the second ''Nachtmusik'' movement of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Mahler)|Seventh Symphony]] were used as the signature theme of Castrol TV commercials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/766203/Castrol-launches-competition-update-ad-soundtrack/|title=Castrol launches competition to update ad soundtrack|website=brandrepublic.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110075123/http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/766203/Castrol-launches-competition-update-ad-soundtrack|archivedate=10 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWakefield vehicles advertised the company and Castrol on their sides; models of them were made by [[Dinky Toys]], and in later times became sought-after collectors' items.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-36302547|title=Rare Dinky toy collection fetches \u00a3150k at Devon auction|publisher=BBC News|date=15 June 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615133736/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-36302547|archivedate=15 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> One example from 1934 to 1935, in very good to excellent condition, was estimated to fetch \u00a31,000-\u00a31,500 at auction in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.the-saleroom.com/en-gb/auction-catalogues/special-auction-services/catalogue-id-srspe10146/lot-72b41082-95f1-4692-bd58-a5b100d9ef76 |title=A Pre-War Dinky Toys 28m 'Wakefield's Castrol' Delivery Van, type 1, \"Meccano Dinky Toys\" cast to |publisher=The-saleroom.com |date=9 March 2016 |accessdate=15 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526040709/http://www.the-saleroom.com/en-gb/auction-catalogues/special-auction-services/catalogue-id-srspe10146/lot-72b41082-95f1-4692-bd58-a5b100d9ef76 |archivedate=26 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.castrol.com/ Official Site \u2013 Castrol Motor Oil]\n\n{{BP}}\n\n[[Category:Automotive companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:BP subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:Burmah-Castrol|*]]\n[[Category:Chemical companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Motor oils]]\n[[Category:Multinational companies]]\n[[Category:Oil companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Petroleum products]]\n[[Category:British brands]]\n[[Category:1899 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:British companies established in 1899]]\n[[Category:Energy companies established in 1899]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1899]]\n", "name_user": "95.49.144.44", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castrol"}
