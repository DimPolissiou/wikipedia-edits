Cargo airlines serving the airport are [[FedEx Express]], [[UPS Airlines]], [[Empire Airlines]] (a [[FedEx Feeder]] carrier), [[Ameriflight]], and South Aero. The airport is designated as [[Airspace class (United States)#Class C|Class C]] airspace.\n\nRestaurants and shops within the airport include national brands like [[Hudson Group|Hudson News and Book Sellers]], Keva Juice, and [[Panda Express]]. It also includes regional [[gift shop]]s and local eateries such as Black Mesa Coffee, Rio Grande Brew Pub & Grill, and [[New Mexican cuisine]] restaurants like Tia Juanita\u2019s and Comida Buena.\n\nThe low-lying structure and [[Pueblo Revival architecture]] of the airport reference Albuquerque's [[Tiwa Puebloans|Tiquex]] and [[Hispanos of New Mexico|Hispano]] heritage and New Mexico's [[Pueblo]] and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] roots.\n\n==History==\nAlbuquerque was first served by two private airports. [[Oxnard Field]] opened in 1928, and [[West Mesa Airport]], also known as the TWA airport, opened in 1930. The first airlines to serve the airports were [[Transcontinental Air Transport]] (TAT), [[Western Air Express]] (WAE), and Mid Continent Air Express, all inaugurating service in 1929. At first the airlines operated from Oxnard Field (which was also called '''Albuquerque Airport''') but moved to the West Mesa Airport for most of the 1930s decade. TAT and WAE merged in 1930 to form [[Transcontinental and Western Air]] (TWA). Mid Continent Air Express' service was replaced by [[Varney Speed Lines]] in 1934. Three years later Varney changed its name to [[Continental Airlines]].\n\nIn 1935 it was suggested that the city build a new public airport using [[Works Progress Administration]] money. Having secured US$520,500 in funding, Governor [[Clyde Tingley]] broke ground for the project on February 28, 1937. '''Albuquerque Municipal Airport''' opened in 1939 with two paved runways, a [[Pueblo Style]] [[Airport terminal|terminal]] building designed by Ernest Blumenthal, and a massive [[hangar]] designed to accommodate the new [[Boeing 307]] operated by TWA. TWA became Trans World Airlines in 1946.<ref>{{cite book |last=Biebel |first=Charles D. |date=1986 |title=Making the Most of It: Public Works in Albuquerque during the Great Depression 1929\u20131942 |location=Albuquerque, New Mexico |publisher=The Albuquerque Museum |pp=66\u201367}}</ref> Monarch Airlines came to Albuquerque in 1947 then merged with other carriers to become [[Frontier Airlines (1950\u20131986)|Frontier Airlines]] in 1950. [[Pioneer Airlines]] began service in 1948 and merged into Continental Airlines in 1955. The airport was renamed '''Albuquerque Sunport''' on April 17, 1963.\n\nThe April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 31 weekday departures: 13 on Continental Airlines, 12 on [[TWA]] and 6 on Frontier Airlines. [[Trans-Texas Airways]] (later [[Texas International Airlines]]) came to Albuquerque in 1963 rounding out the first four carriers to serve the airport prior to the airline deregulation act of 1978.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe present terminal was designed by William E. Burk Jr.<ref name=\"arch\">{{cite book |last1=Price |first1=Vincent Barrett |title=Albuquerque: A City at the End of the World |url={{google books|X-MzbiOCmNUC|plainurl=yes|page=36}} |date=2003 |orig-year=1992 |edition=2nd |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |location=Albuquerque, New Mexico |isbn=0-8263-3097-5 |page=36}}</ref> It is built just east of the original terminal, and opened on November 12, 1965. At first the terminal had eight gates, four at the main building and another four at a small satellite building to the south connected by a tunnel. None of the gates had jetbridges.\n\nThe terminal has been expanded several times, first in 1973 when a west wing was added with a large gate and jetbridge able to handle new wide-body aircraft. TWA used this gate to introduce the [[Lockheed L-1011]] to Albuquerque in 1974 with flights to Chicago. After airline deregulation was passed in 1978, a flood of new airlines came to ABQ. The west wing was expanded in 1980 with three more gates, all of which had jetbridges and were used extensively by TWA and many new carriers. [[Southwest Airlines]] started service on April 3, 1980, using the old gates 1 and 2 at the main terminal and installed three ground level jetbridges at these two gates.\n\nIn 1987-89 the terminal was expanded and renovated advertising a design by [[Phillip Jacobson]] and BPLW Associates.<ref name=\"arch\"/> The satellite gate building was replaced with two concourses, A and B, giving the Sunport 19 new gates, all with jetbridges. Concourse A was further expanded in 1996 with four additional gates. The new above-ground connector link to the concourses was greatly expanded in 2005 to accommodate the need for additional security screening by the TSA after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The airport gained international status and was renamed the '''Albuquerque International Airport''' on September 27, 1971. The name was changed to '''Albuquerque International Sunport''' in 1994.\n\nThe old terminal of 1939 has been restored and houses offices of the [[Transportation Security Administration]]. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.\n\n===Historical airline service===\n\nThe Sunport is served by Alaska, Allegiant, American, Delta, Frontier, jetBlue, Southwest, and United Airlines, as well as two commuter airlines, Advanced Air and Boutique Air. Total weekday departures averaged 85 flights per day in 2019 however the Sunport peaked with 163 flights per day in December 1995 and again in August 2001. In the past Albuquerque has been served by the following commercial airlines:\n:TWA (1929-2001), Continental (1934-2012), Pioneer (1948-1955), Monarch (1947-1950), Frontier (1950\u20131986), Trans Texas/Texas International (1963-1982), Eastern (1979-1988), Western (1981-1987), PSA (1983-1988), America West (1983-2007), Wien Air Alaska (1984), USAir (1988-1997), Braniff (1988-1989), Pan Am (1989-1990), Northwest (1992-2010), Reno Air (1995-1998), Western Pacific/Mountain Air Express (1997), AeroMexico Connect (1993-1994 and 2009-2010), Great Plains (2001-2004), US Airways (formerly USAir, 2007-2015), ExpressJet (2007-2008), and Volaris (2018-2019).\n\n[[TWA]] was first: passenger flights began in 1929, with Albuquerque being one of many stops on a transcontinental route between Los Angeles and New York. TWA had the first jets to serve ABQ, the [[Boeing 707]] and [[Convair 880]] in 1961. In 1974 TWA brought the first wide-body jet to ABQ, the [[Lockheed 1011]]. Service peaked in 1979 with 21 daily departures to 13 cities including nonstops to Los Angeles and New York. After airline deregulation in the early 1980s, TWA downsized its operation and in 1985 only had flights to its hub at St. Louis. Service continued until December 2, 2001, when the carrier merged with American Airlines.\n\n[[Continental Airlines]] was second at Albuquerque, since 1934 as a stop on its north\u2013south route between Denver and El Paso. In 1940 Continental added flights to several smaller cities in Southeastern New Mexico but that was transferred to Frontier and Trans Texas Airways in 1963. In the latter half of the 1960s Continental expanded with [[Boeing 720]], [[Boeing 727]], and [[Douglas DC-9]] jets nonstop to Chicago, Dallas, Denver, El Paso, Lubbock, Midland/Odessa, San Antonio, and San Francisco.  Service peaked in summer 1977 with 24 daily departures. Continental downsized its operation after airline deregulation and by 1994 was only flying to its Houston hub (a nonstop flight to Newark was added for a period in the mid-2000s). Continental merged with United Airlines in 2012.\n\n[[Frontier Airlines (1950\u20131986)|Frontier Airlines]] began service to Albuquerque in 1947 as Monarch Airlines, flying to Salt Lake City with stops at many smaller cities in the four corners states. Service was expanded in the 1960s with [[Boeing 727]] and [[Boeing 737]] jets to Denver, El Paso, Phoenix, Tucson, Dallas, and Las Vegas and in 1973 Frontier operated 19 daily flights at ABQ. Frontier began the first international flights to several resort cities in Mexico in the early 1980s but the carrier closed down in 1986. A new Frontier Airlines came to ABQ in 1994 with flights to Denver and El Paso.  The carrier discontinued service in 2014 but returned in October 2017 with flights once again to Denver. Service to Austin, Orlando and San Antonio were added in 2018 but discontinued in 2019.\n\n[[Pioneer Airlines]] served Albuquerque between 1948 and 1955 with two flights per day to Dallas, Texas making eight stops en route. Pioneer merged into Continental Airlines in 1955 and by 1959 Continental was flying the route nonstop. The Albuquerque to Dallas route would be a major stronghold for Continental for the next 20 years.  \n\nIn 1963 [[Trans-Texas Airways]] came to Albuquerque, taking over service to the smaller cities in New Mexico that Continental had served. It later expanded with nonstop [[Douglas DC-9]]s to Dallas and Los Angeles. TTa became [[Texas International Airlines]] in 1969 and flew DC-9's from ABQ to Santa Fe and Roswell, New Mexico. The carrier peaked in 1975 with 15 daily departures and merged with Continental Airlines in 1982.\n\n[[Southwest Airlines]] began service to the Sunport in 1980 and expanded quickly creating a hub at ABQ. The carrier took over the number one spot by the early 1980s and peaked with 66 daily departures in October 2001. Although Southwest has cut back since then, it has served 28 cities nonstop from ABQ.\n\n[[American Airlines]] began serving the Sunport in 1979, [[Delta Airlines]] in 1982, [[United Airlines]] in 1983, [[jetBlue]] in 2013, [[Alaska Airlines]] in 2014, and [[Allegiant Air]] in 2016.\n\nAt least 34 commuter and regional airlines have served Albuquerque, the largest of these by far was [[Mesa Airlines]] which served the Sunport from 1980 through 2007. Mesa peaked with 46 daily departures in 1990 and served 18 cities in New Mexico and Colorado nonstop from their hub in ABQ. Mesa still serves ABQ but now as a regional airline providing feeder service for American Eagle and United Express on regional jets. Other larger commuter airlines that served the Sunport for many years include [[Air Midwest]] and [[Great Lakes Airlines]].\n\nRegional airlines serving the airport on behalf of the majors are; SkyWest, ExpressJet, Republic, TransStates, GoJet, Compass, Envoy, and Horizon Air.  Sun Country Airlines, Xtra Airways, Swift Air, and Elite Airways also serve ABQ with regular public charter flights to Laughlin and Wendover, Nevada.<ref>timetables from all the airlines that have served Albuquerque{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, low-cost Mexican carrier [[Volaris]] began serving Albuquerque from Guadalajara, Mexico and later from Chihuahua, Mexico. Volaris stopped serving Albuquerque in June 2019 due to very low passenger loads and a disagreement over government subsidies to its flights.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hamway |first1=Stephen |title=Ay, Chihuahua!

The airport continues to share its runways with Kirtland AFB, which also handles rescue and firefighting operations.  An [[Air Force Global Strike Command]] (AFGSC) installation, the host unit is the [[377th Air Base Wing]] (377 ABW).  Flying units at Kirtland AFB consist of the [[58th Special Operations Wing]] (58 SOW) of the [[Air Education and Training Command]] (AETC) and the [[150th Fighter Wing]] (150 FW), an [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC)-gained unit of the [[New Mexico Air National Guard]].\n\n===Future developments===\nThe Airport Master Plan drafted in 2002 lays out intermediate- and long-term projects at the Sunport, including the removal of Runway 17/35 and the construction of a second terminal when traffic demands it. The runway closure recommendation was based on safety, [[noise abatement]], and the cost of upkeep. Because 17/35 intersected all three of the other runways, it ran the highest risk of [[runway incursion]]s. The runway was closed in Summer 2012, and the tarmac is used for taxiing aircraft, and for a firefighting training aircraft located on the north end.<ref name=Fedexplane>{{cite web |title=FedEx Donates Boeing 727-200F Aircraft to Albuquerque International Sunport |url=http://www.cabq.gov/mayor/news/fedex-donates-boeing-727-200f-aircraft-to-albuquerque-international-sunport |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329000714/http://www.cabq.gov/mayor/news/fedex-donates-boeing-727-200f-aircraft-to-albuquerque-international-sunport |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 29, 2013 |website=City of Albuquerque |accessdate=January 27, 2015 }}</ref> The configuration of the other three runways, in conjunction with typical wind patterns, enabled them to handle departures and landings more efficiently.\n\nIn the longer term, the plan calls for a new terminal to be built to the northeast of the existing terminal.

[[American Airlines]], [[Alaska Airlines]], and [[Frontier Airlines]] occasionally operate Airbus A321's as equipment swaps. The largest regular passenger aircraft used to be the [[Boeing 757-200]] operated by Delta Airlines, who flew the aircraft to and from Atlanta, Cincinnati, and Minneapolis. The largest commercial aircraft the Sunport usually sees is a [[FedEx]] or [[UPS Airlines|UPS]] [[Boeing 767-300]], replacing the latter's [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] that now only fly in on rare occasions. The largest passenger aircraft to have ever flown in is the [[Boeing 777]], of which some flying for United have been diverted to the Sunport from [[Denver International Airport]] on a couple of occasions.\n\nIn 2013 the aerial firefighting company, 10 Tanker Air Carrier, moved its headquarters to Albuquerque and currently have three [[DC-10]] large air tankers based out of Albuquerque International Sunport.\n\nThe largest aircraft of any type to regularly visit the Sunport is the [[C-5 Galaxy]]. In 1974 and again from 1982 through 1992 the airport had scheduled [[Trans World Airlines]] [[Lockheed L-1011]]s. The largest aircraft to have ever visited the Sunport is the [[Antonov An-124]], of which some have landed at the airport on a couple of extremely rare occasions.\n\n==Terminal==\n[[File:AlbuquerqueNMsistercities.JPG|thumb|Banner inside the airport terminal listing Albuquerque's [[sister cities]]]]\nAlbuquerque International Sunport has one terminal with 25 gates in four concourses, including a concourse for [[commuter airline]] gates.

Gate 11 was closed when the terminal was expanded in 1989 and the remaining three gates were renumbered to C1, C2, & C3.  TWA continued to use these gates for a few more years until gates C2 and C3 showed signs of structural failure and later had to be demolished. TWA moved to concourse B and the lobby area of gate C1 (the gate built in 1973) has mostly been converted to office space. The lower level of gate C1 houses U. S. Customs and is still used for occasional international arriving flights. Concourse D was a ground-level commuter aircraft concourse that was used by [[Great Plains Airlines]].  It was closed in 2004 after Great Plains Airlines liquidated due to insolvency. Concourse D is currently a weight and fitness facility for airport employees. Concourse E is used primarily by [[Boutique Air]].  \n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport destination list | 3rdcoltitle = Refs | 3rdcolunsortable=yes\n<!-- -->\n| [[Advanced Air]] |[[Grant County Airport (New Mexico)|Silver City]] | <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.advancedairlines.com/shuttles/|title=Advanced Air Shuttles &#124; Book a Seat on Our Shuttle Flights|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106104517/https://www.advancedairlines.com/shuttles/|archive-date=January 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>https://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/news/2019/01/07/advanced-air-abq-sunport-burbank.html?iana=hpmvp_abq_news_headline/</ref> \n<!-- -->\n| [[Alaska Airlines]] |[[Portland International Airport|Portland (OR)]], [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport|Seattle/Tacoma]] | <ref name=\"AlaskaRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight Timetable|url=https://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/timetables.aspx|access-date=January 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202123138/https://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/timetables.aspx|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Allegiant Air]] | [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport|Austin]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Orlando Sanford International Airport|Orlando/Sanford]] (begins June 4, 2020)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ir.allegiantair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/allegiant-announces-largest-service-expansion-company-history-3|title=Allegiant Announces Largest Service Expansion In Company History With 3 New Cities And 44 Nonstop Routes|publisher=Allegiant Airlines}}</ref> | <ref name=DavisAlbuquerqueBusFirst /><ref name=\"AllegiantRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Allegiant Air|url=https://www.allegiantair.com|access-date=January 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224233038/http://www.allegiantair.com/|archive-date=February 24, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[American Airlines]] | [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix\u2013Sky Harbor]] | <ref name=\"AmericanRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight schedules and notifications|url=https://www.aa.com/travelInformation/flights/schedule|access-date=January 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202010611/https://www.aa.com/travelInformation/flights/schedule|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| {{nowrap|[[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]]}} | [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix\u2013Sky Harbor]] | <ref name=\"AmericanRoutes\"/>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Boutique Air]] | [[Cavern City Air Terminal|Carlsbad (NM)]] | <ref name=\"BoutiqueRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Route Map and Schedule|url=https://www.boutiqueair.com/p/schedule|accessdate=February 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205023354/https://www.boutiqueair.com/p/schedule|archive-date=December 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Delta Air Lines]] | [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Salt Lake City International Airport|Salt Lake City]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis/St. Paul]] | <ref name=\"DeltaRoutes\">{{cite web|title=FLIGHT SCHEDULES|url=https://www.delta.com/flightinfo/viewFlightSchedulesSetup.action|accessdate=January 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621123636/http://www.delta.com/flightinfo/viewFlightSchedulesSetup.action|archive-date=June 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Delta Connection]] | [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Salt Lake City International Airport|Salt Lake City]] | <ref name=\"DeltaRoutes\"/>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Frontier Airlines]] | [[Denver International Airport|Denver]] | <ref name=DavisAlbuquerqueBusFirst>{{cite news |last=Davis |first=Ron |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/news/2017/07/18/frontier-airlines-returning-albuquerque-sunport.html |title=Major airline returning to Albuquerque International Sunport |work=[[Albuq.

[[Oxnard Field]] opened in 1928, and [[West Mesa Airport]], also known as the TWA airport, opened in 1930. The first airlines to serve the airports were [[Transcontinental Air Transport]] (TAT), [[Western Air Express]] (WAE), and Mid Continent Air Express, all inaugurating service in 1929. At first the airlines operated from Oxnard Field (which was also called '''Albuquerque Airport''') but moved to the West Mesa Airport for most of the 1930s decade. TAT and WAE merged in 1930 to form [[Transcontinental and Western Air]] (TWA). Mid Continent Air Express' service was replaced by [[Varney Speed Lines]] in 1934. Three years later Varney changed its name to [[Continental Airlines]].\n\nIn 1935 it was suggested that the city build a new public airport using [[Works Progress Administration]] money. Having secured US$520,500 in funding, Governor [[Clyde Tingley]] broke ground for the project on February 28, 1937. '''Albuquerque Municipal Airport''' opened in 1939 with two paved runways, a [[Pueblo Style]] [[Airport terminal|terminal]] building designed by Ernest Blumenthal, and a massive [[hangar]] designed to accommodate the new [[Boeing 307]] operated by TWA. TWA became Trans World Airlines in 1946.<ref>{{cite book |last=Biebel |first=Charles D. |date=1986 |title=Making the Most of It: Public Works in Albuquerque during the Great Depression 1929\u20131942 |location=Albuquerque, New Mexico |publisher=The Albuquerque Museum |pp=66\u201367}}</ref> Monarch Airlines came to Albuquerque in 1947 then merged with other carriers to become [[Frontier Airlines (1950\u20131986)|Frontier Airlines]] in 1950. [[Pioneer Airlines]] began service in 1948 and merged into Continental Airlines in 1955. The airport was renamed '''Albuquerque Sunport''' on April 17, 1963.\n\nThe April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 31 weekday departures: 13 on Continental Airlines, 12 on [[TWA]] and 6 on Frontier Airlines. [[Trans-Texas Airways]] (later [[Texas International Airlines]]) came to Albuquerque in 1963 rounding out the first four carriers to serve the airport prior to the airline deregulation act of 1978.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe present terminal was designed by William E. Burk Jr.<ref name=\"arch\">{{cite book |last1=Price |first1=Vincent Barrett |title=Albuquerque: A City at the End of the World |url={{google books|X-MzbiOCmNUC|plainurl=yes|page=36}} |date=2003 |orig-year=1992 |edition=2nd |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |location=Albuquerque, New Mexico |isbn=0-8263-3097-5 |page=36}}</ref> It is built just east of the original terminal, and opened on November 12, 1965. At first the terminal had eight gates, four at the main building and another four at a small satellite building to the south connected by a tunnel. None of the gates had jetbridges.\n\nThe terminal has been expanded several times, first in 1973 when a west wing was added with a large gate and jetbridge able to handle new wide-body aircraft. TWA used this gate to introduce the [[Lockheed L-1011]] to Albuquerque in 1974 with flights to Chicago. After airline deregulation was passed in 1978, a flood of new airlines came to ABQ. The west wing was expanded in 1980 with three more gates, all of which had jetbridges and were used extensively by TWA and many new carriers. [[Southwest Airlines]] started service on April 3, 1980, using the old gates 1 and 2 at the main terminal and installed three ground level jetbridges at these two gates.\n\nIn 1987-89 the terminal was expanded and renovated advertising a design by [[Phillip Jacobson]] and BPLW Associates.<ref name=\"arch\"/> The satellite gate building was replaced with two concourses, A and B, giving the Sunport 19 new gates, all with jetbridges. Concourse A was further expanded in 1996 with four additional gates. The new above-ground connector link to the concourses was greatly expanded in 2005 to accommodate the need for additional security screening by the TSA after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The airport gained international status and was renamed the '''Albuquerque International Airport''' on September 27, 1971. The name was changed to '''Albuquerque International Sunport''' in 1994.\n\nThe old terminal of 1939 has been restored and houses offices of the [[Transportation Security Administration]]. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.\n\n===Historical airline service===\n\nThe Sunport is served by Alaska, Allegiant, American, Delta, Frontier, jetBlue, Southwest, and United Airlines, as well as two commuter airlines, Advanced Air and Boutique Air. Total weekday departures averaged 85 flights per day in 2019 however the Sunport peaked with 163 flights per day in December 1995 and again in August 2001. In the past Albuquerque has been served by the following commercial airlines:\n:TWA (1929-2001), Continental (1934-2012), Pioneer (1948-1955), Monarch (1947-1950), Frontier (1950\u20131986), Trans Texas/Texas International (1963-1982), Eastern (1979-1988), Western (1981-1987), PSA (1983-1988), America West (1983-2007), Wien Air Alaska (1984), USAir (1988-1997), Braniff (1988-1989), Pan Am (1989-1990), Northwest (1992-2010), Reno Air (1995-1998), Western Pacific/Mountain Air Express (1997), AeroMexico Connect (1993-1994 and 2009-2010), Great Plains (2001-2004), US Airways (formerly USAir, 2007-2015), ExpressJet (2007-2008), and Volaris (2018-2019).\n\n[[TWA]] was first: passenger flights began in 1929, with Albuquerque being one of many stops on a transcontinental route between Los Angeles and New York. TWA had the first jets to serve ABQ, the [[Boeing 707]] and [[Convair 880]] in 1961. In 1974 TWA brought the first wide-body jet to ABQ, the [[Lockheed 1011]]. Service peaked in 1979 with 21 daily departures to 13 cities including nonstops to Los Angeles and New York. After airline deregulation in the early 1980s, TWA downsized its operation and in 1985 only had flights to its hub at St. Louis. Service continued until December 2, 2001, when the carrier merged with American Airlines.\n\n[[Continental Airlines]] was second at Albuquerque, since 1934 as a stop on its north\u2013south route between Denver and El Paso. In 1940 Continental added flights to several smaller cities in Southeastern New Mexico but that was transferred to Frontier and Trans Texas Airways in 1963. In the latter half of the 1960s Continental expanded with [[Boeing 720]], [[Boeing 727]], and [[Douglas DC-9]] jets nonstop to Chicago, Dallas, Denver, El Paso, Lubbock, Midland/Odessa, San Antonio, and San Francisco.  Service peaked in summer 1977 with 24 daily departures. Continental downsized its operation after airline deregulation and by 1994 was only flying to its Houston hub (a nonstop flight to Newark was added for a period in the mid-2000s). Continental merged with United Airlines in 2012.\n\n[[Frontier Airlines (1950\u20131986)|Frontier Airlines]] began service to Albuquerque in 1947 as Monarch Airlines, flying to Salt Lake City with stops at many smaller cities in the four corners states. Service was expanded in the 1960s with [[Boeing 727]] and [[Boeing 737]] jets to Denver, El Paso, Phoenix, Tucson, Dallas, and Las Vegas and in 1973 Frontier operated 19 daily flights at ABQ. Frontier began the first international flights to several resort cities in Mexico in the early 1980s but the carrier closed down in 1986. A new Frontier Airlines came to ABQ in 1994 with flights to Denver and El Paso.  The carrier discontinued service in 2014 but returned in October 2017 with flights once again to Denver. Service to Austin, Orlando and San Antonio were added in 2018 but discontinued in 2019.\n\n[[Pioneer Airlines]] served Albuquerque between 1948 and 1955 with two flights per day to Dallas, Texas making eight stops en route. Pioneer merged into Continental Airlines in 1955 and by 1959 Continental was flying the route nonstop. The Albuquerque to Dallas route would be a major stronghold for Continental for the next 20 years.  \n\nIn 1963 [[Trans-Texas Airways]] came to Albuquerque, taking over service to the smaller cities in New Mexico that Continental had served. It later expanded with nonstop [[Douglas DC-9]]s to Dallas and Los Angeles. TTa became [[Texas International Airlines]] in 1969 and flew DC-9's from ABQ to Santa Fe and Roswell, New Mexico. The carrier peaked in 1975 with 15 daily departures and merged with Continental Airlines in 1982.\n\n[[Southwest Airlines]] began service to the Sunport in 1980 and expanded quickly creating a hub at ABQ. The carrier took over the number one spot by the early 1980s and peaked with 66 daily departures in October 2001. Although Southwest has cut back since then, it has served 28 cities nonstop from ABQ.\n\n[[American Airlines]] began serving the Sunport in 1979, [[Delta Airlines]] in 1982, [[United Airlines]] in 1983, [[jetBlue]] in 2013, [[Alaska Airlines]] in 2014, and [[Allegiant Air]] in 2016.\n\nAt least 34 commuter and regional airlines have served Albuquerque, the largest of these by far was [[Mesa Airlines]] which served the Sunport from 1980 through 2007. Mesa peaked with 46 daily departures in 1990 and served 18 cities in New Mexico and Colorado nonstop from their hub in ABQ. Mesa still serves ABQ but now as a regional airline providing feeder service for American Eagle and United Express on regional jets. Other larger commuter airlines that served the Sunport for many years include [[Air Midwest]] and [[Great Lakes Airlines]].\n\nRegional airlines serving the airport on behalf of the majors are; SkyWest, ExpressJet, Republic, TransStates, GoJet, Compass, Envoy, and Horizon Air.  Sun Country Airlines, Xtra Airways, Swift Air, and Elite Airways also serve ABQ with regular public charter flights to Laughlin and Wendover, Nevada.<ref>timetables from all the airlines that have served Albuquerque{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, low-cost Mexican carrier [[Volaris]] began serving Albuquerque from Guadalajara, Mexico and later from Chihuahua, Mexico. Volaris stopped serving Albuquerque in June 2019 due to very low passenger loads and a disagreement over government subsidies to its flights.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hamway |first1=Stephen |title=Ay, Chihuahua!

The airport continues to share its runways with Kirtland AFB, which also handles rescue and firefighting operations.  An [[Air Force Global Strike Command]] (AFGSC) installation, the host unit is the [[377th Air Base Wing]] (377 ABW).  Flying units at Kirtland AFB consist of the [[58th Special Operations Wing]] (58 SOW) of the [[Air Education and Training Command]] (AETC) and the [[150th Fighter Wing]] (150 FW), an [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC)-gained unit of the [[New Mexico Air National Guard]].\n\n===Future developments===\nThe Airport Master Plan drafted in 2002 lays out intermediate- and long-term projects at the Sunport, including the removal of Runway 17/35 and the construction of a second terminal when traffic demands it. The runway closure recommendation was based on safety, [[noise abatement]], and the cost of upkeep. Because 17/35 intersected all three of the other runways, it ran the highest risk of [[runway incursion]]s. The runway was closed in Summer 2012, and the tarmac is used for taxiing aircraft, and for a firefighting training aircraft located on the north end.<ref name=Fedexplane>{{cite web |title=FedEx Donates Boeing 727-200F Aircraft to Albuquerque International Sunport |url=http://www.cabq.gov/mayor/news/fedex-donates-boeing-727-200f-aircraft-to-albuquerque-international-sunport |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329000714/http://www.cabq.gov/mayor/news/fedex-donates-boeing-727-200f-aircraft-to-albuquerque-international-sunport |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 29, 2013 |website=City of Albuquerque |accessdate=January 27, 2015 }}</ref> The configuration of the other three runways, in conjunction with typical wind patterns, enabled them to handle departures and landings more efficiently.\n\nIn the longer term, the plan calls for a new terminal to be built to the northeast of the existing terminal.

The airport has a [[Pueblo Revival Style architecture|Pueblo Revival style]] passenger terminal which houses two concourses and an area for commuter airline gates.\n\nThe largest passenger aircraft scheduled into Albuquerque is the [[Airbus A321]], operated by [[Delta Air Lines]] on flights to Atlanta. [[American Airlines]], [[Alaska Airlines]], and [[Frontier Airlines]] occasionally operate Airbus A321's as equipment swaps. The largest regular passenger aircraft used to be the [[Boeing 757-200]] operated by Delta Airlines, who flew the aircraft to and from Atlanta, Cincinnati, and Minneapolis. The largest commercial aircraft the Sunport usually sees is a [[FedEx]] or [[UPS Airlines|UPS]] [[Boeing 767-300]], replacing the latter's [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] that now only fly in on rare occasions. The largest passenger aircraft to have ever flown in is the [[Boeing 777]], of which some flying for United have been diverted to the Sunport from [[Denver International Airport]] on a couple of occasions.\n\nIn 2013 the aerial firefighting company, 10 Tanker Air Carrier, moved its headquarters to Albuquerque and currently have three [[DC-10]] large air tankers based out of Albuquerque International Sunport.\n\nThe largest aircraft of any type to regularly visit the Sunport is the [[C-5 Galaxy]]. In 1974 and again from 1982 through 1992 the airport had scheduled [[Trans World Airlines]] [[Lockheed L-1011]]s. The largest aircraft to have ever visited the Sunport is the [[Antonov An-124]], of which some have landed at the airport on a couple of extremely rare occasions.\n\n==Terminal==\n[[File:AlbuquerqueNMsistercities.JPG|thumb|Banner inside the airport terminal listing Albuquerque's [[sister cities]]]]\nAlbuquerque International Sunport has one terminal with 25 gates in four concourses, including a concourse for [[commuter airline]] gates.

Gate 11 was closed when the terminal was expanded in 1989 and the remaining three gates were renumbered to C1, C2, & C3.  TWA continued to use these gates for a few more years until gates C2 and C3 showed signs of structural failure and later had to be demolished. TWA moved to concourse B and the lobby area of gate C1 (the gate built in 1973) has mostly been converted to office space. The lower level of gate C1 houses U. S. Customs and is still used for occasional international arriving flights. Concourse D was a ground-level commuter aircraft concourse that was used by [[Great Plains Airlines]].  It was closed in 2004 after Great Plains Airlines liquidated due to insolvency. Concourse D is currently a weight and fitness facility for airport employees. Concourse E is used primarily by [[Boutique Air]].  \n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport destination list | 3rdcoltitle = Refs | 3rdcolunsortable=yes\n<!-- -->\n| [[Advanced Air]] |[[Grant County Airport (New Mexico)|Silver City]] | <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.advancedairlines.com/shuttles/|title=Advanced Air Shuttles &#124; Book a Seat on Our Shuttle Flights|access-date=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106104517/https://www.advancedairlines.com/shuttles/|archive-date=January 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>https://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/news/2019/01/07/advanced-air-abq-sunport-burbank.html?iana=hpmvp_abq_news_headline/</ref> \n<!-- -->\n| [[Alaska Airlines]] |[[Portland International Airport|Portland (OR)]], [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport|Seattle/Tacoma]] | <ref name=\"AlaskaRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight Timetable|url=https://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/timetables.aspx|access-date=January 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202123138/https://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/timetables.aspx|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Allegiant Air]] | [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport|Austin]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Orlando Sanford International Airport|Orlando/Sanford]] (begins June 4, 2020)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ir.allegiantair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/allegiant-announces-largest-service-expansion-company-history-3|title=Allegiant Announces Largest Service Expansion In Company History With 3 New Cities And 44 Nonstop Routes|publisher=Allegiant Airlines}}</ref> | <ref name=DavisAlbuquerqueBusFirst /><ref name=\"AllegiantRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Allegiant Air|url=https://www.allegiantair.com|access-date=January 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224233038/http://www.allegiantair.com/|archive-date=February 24, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[American Airlines]] | [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix\u2013Sky Harbor]] | <ref name=\"AmericanRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Flight schedules and notifications|url=https://www.aa.com/travelInformation/flights/schedule|access-date=January 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202010611/https://www.aa.com/travelInformation/flights/schedule|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| {{nowrap|[[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]]}} | [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix\u2013Sky Harbor]] | <ref name=\"AmericanRoutes\"/>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Boutique Air]] | [[Cavern City Air Terminal|Carlsbad (NM)]] | <ref name=\"BoutiqueRoutes\">{{cite web|title=Route Map and Schedule|url=https://www.boutiqueair.com/p/schedule|accessdate=February 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205023354/https://www.boutiqueair.com/p/schedule|archive-date=December 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Delta Air Lines]] | [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Salt Lake City International Airport|Salt Lake City]]<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis/St. Paul]] | <ref name=\"DeltaRoutes\">{{cite web|title=FLIGHT SCHEDULES|url=https://www.delta.com/flightinfo/viewFlightSchedulesSetup.action|accessdate=January 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621123636/http://www.delta.com/flightinfo/viewFlightSchedulesSetup.action|archive-date=June 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Delta Connection]] | [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Salt Lake City International Airport|Salt Lake City]] | <ref name=\"DeltaRoutes\"/>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Frontier Airlines]] | [[Denver International Airport|Denver]] | <ref name=DavisAlbuquerqueBusFirst>{{cite news |last=Davis |first=Ron |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/news/2017/07/18/frontier-airlines-returning-albuquerque-sunport.html |title=Major airline returning to Albuquerque International Sunport |work=[[Albuq.

Originally a modified version of the Firestreak, Red Top emerged as a much more capable weapon, with roughly double the range, a more sensitive seeker giving limited all-aspect capability, and an even larger warhead than the already-large one in Firestreak.\n\nRed Top was originally intended to replace Firestreak outright, but carrying the missiles on the [[English Electric Lightning]] required additional area to be added to the Lightning's [[vertical stabilizer]]. For this reason, Firestreak continued to be used on older models of the Lightning. Both missiles passed out of service in 1988 when the last of the Lightnings retired.\n\n==Development==\n===Improved Blue Jay===\nEven before the original [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance. Still known by its [[rainbow code]] \"Blue Jay\", Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor, Magpie II. Mk. III derated the motor to limit acceleration when launched at high speed in order to avoid overheating due to aerodynamic friction. Neither project was proceeded with.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=35}}\n\n===Blue Vesta===\nLooking for a further improved weapon for the [[Operational Requirement F.155]] interceptors, in 1955 the Air Ministry issued OR.1131 for an all-aspect design capability against enemy aircraft traveling at Mach 2. De Havilland responded with Blue Jay Mk. IV, which was later given its own rainbow code, \"Blue Vesta\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\nBlue Vesta adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk. II, further upgrading the motor to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as \"mach tips\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}{{efn|More widely known today as a cropped delta.}}\n\nWork on Blue Vesta was curtailed after 1956 as the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) concluded that the rapid closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so quick that the missile would have no chance to be launched while it was still within the range of its seeker. They suggested moving to the much larger [[radar]]-guided [[Red Hebe]], although some low-level work on Blue Vesta's underlying technologies continued.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\n===Red Top===\nF.155 was canceled in the aftermath of the release of the [[1957 Defence White Paper]]. It was decided to proceed with the development of the [[English Electric Lightning]] largely because it was already close to being complete. Blue Vesta was reactivated in July 1957 to arm this aircraft. For security reasons, yet another rainbow code was assigned in November 1957 and it became Red Top.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nIn contrast to Blue Vesta, Red Top significantly rationalised the original Blue Jay design. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail design of the Firestreak and allowing the new \"Linnet\" rocket motor to more completely fill the increased volume. With the engine isolated at the rear of the missile, the warhead was moved forward from its former location wrapped around the engine at the rear. The former location required the control fin actuators to be placed in the nose, operating the fins using long pushrods running the length of the fuselage. These were removed, giving it a much more logical layout and further increasing internal volume.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe all-aspect [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) system known as \"Violet Banner\". This seeker lacked the sensitivity of the PbTe model and did not offer general all-aspect capability; while it worked against supersonic targets warmed by skin friction, it would not work against subsonic targets and required a tail-aspect in these cases.<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/aveeltg.html The English Electric (BAC) Lightning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This loss in performance was offset to some degree through a greatly increased the [[field of view]] to 60&nbsp;degrees. Firestreak's tube-powered electronics were replaced by [[transistor]]ized versions, which were smaller, greatly improved reliability, and eliminated the need for continual cooling.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nWith the warhead moved forward and the guidance electronics now taking up less room, the warhead was enlarged to 31&nbsp;kg (68.3&nbsp;lb) from Firestreak's already prodigious 22.7&nbsp;kg (50&nbsp;lb). It also used an [[expanding-rod warhead]] in place of the earlier blast fragmentation type. This move also left room at the rear of the fuselage for one of the two rows of the IR [[proximity fuse]], improving its view of targets. The new \"Green Garland\" fuse required smaller rectangular \"windows\", compared to the Firestreak's triangular windows, further simplifying the layout.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe Red Top was faster<ref name=Boyne267>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267 Boyne, Walter J, ''Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia, Volume 1''], pub ABC-CLIO Inc, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57607-345-9}} p267.</ref> and had greater range and maneuvrability than the Firestreak, and its [[infrared seeker]] enabled a wider range of engagement angles. \"Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, Red Top and Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.\"<ref name=Black141>Black, Ian, ''The Last of the Lightnings'', pub PSL, 1996, {{ISBN|1-85260-541-3}}, p141.</ref>\n\n===Almost cancelled===\nAlthough Red Top was a relatively straightforward upgrade to Firestreak, [[Duncan Sandys]] almost cancelled it as well. He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Mk. II]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] entered service in the early 1960s and eliminated the need for [[interceptor aircraft]] altogether. The [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top's head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement is less when launched from Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting four Red Top on [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], likely the B.112 version that had been proposed to replace Sea Vixen for long-duration [[combat air patrol]].{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nIndependently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of [[Hawker Aircraft]] also considered using Red Top on the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]]. The concept fit the aircraft with a more powerful engine, added the [[AIRPASS]] radar from the Lightning, and carried a pair of Red Top missiles.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Testing and service===\n[[File:Red Top.jpg|right|thumb|Red Top on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford|RAF Museum Cosford]].]]\n[[File:Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile mounted on an [[English Electric Lightning]] at the [[RAF Museum]] at [[Hendon]], [[London]]. ]]\n\nRed Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Vesta program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service on both the Lightning and Sea Vixen in [[1964 in aviation|1964]]. It remained in service until the final retirement of the Lightning in [[1988 in aviation|1988]].<ref>Gibson 2007, p. 41, 42</ref> Unusually, the missile that the Red Top was intended to replace \u2013 Firestreak \u2013 also remained in service on the Lightning until 1988. This was because Red Top's larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability, leaving Firestreak on the other models that were already in service.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Further upgrades===\nWhile development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a [[semi-active radar homing]] version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section.

Originally a modified version of the Firestreak, Red Top emerged as a much more capable weapon, with roughly double the range, a more sensitive seeker giving limited all-aspect capability, and an even larger warhead than the already-large one in Firestreak.\n\nRed Top was originally intended to replace Firestreak outright, but carrying the missiles on the [[English Electric Lightning]] required additional area to be added to the Lightning's [[vertical stabilizer]]. For this reason, Firestreak continued to be used on older models of the Lightning. Both missiles passed out of service in 1988 when the last of the Lightnings retired.\n\n==Development==\n===Improved Blue Jay===\nEven before the original [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance. Still known by its [[rainbow code]] \"Blue Jay\", Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor, Magpie II. Mk. III derated the motor to limit acceleration when launched at high speed in order to avoid overheating due to aerodynamic friction. Neither project was proceeded with.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=35}}\n\n===Blue Vesta===\nLooking for a further improved weapon for the [[Operational Requirement F.155]] interceptors, in 1955 the Air Ministry issued OR.1131 for an all-aspect design capability against enemy aircraft traveling at Mach 2. De Havilland responded with Blue Jay Mk. IV, which was later given its own rainbow code, \"Blue Vesta\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\nBlue Vesta adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk. II, further upgrading the motor to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as \"mach tips\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}{{efn|More widely known today as a cropped delta.}}\n\nWork on Blue Vesta was curtailed after 1956 as the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) concluded that the rapid closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so quick that the missile would have no chance to be launched while it was still within the range of its seeker. They suggested moving to the much larger [[radar]]-guided [[Red Hebe]], although some low-level work on Blue Vesta's underlying technologies continued.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\n===Red Top===\nF.155 was canceled in the aftermath of the release of the [[1957 Defence White Paper]]. It was decided to proceed with the development of the [[English Electric Lightning]] largely because it was already close to being complete. Blue Vesta was reactivated in July 1957 to arm this aircraft. For security reasons, yet another rainbow code was assigned in November 1957 and it became Red Top.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nIn contrast to Blue Vesta, Red Top significantly rationalised the original Blue Jay design. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail design of the Firestreak and allowing the new \"Linnet\" rocket motor to more completely fill the increased volume. With the engine isolated at the rear of the missile, the warhead was moved forward from its former location wrapped around the engine at the rear. The former location required the control fin actuators to be placed in the nose, operating the fins using long pushrods running the length of the fuselage. These were removed, giving it a much more logical layout and further increasing internal volume.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe all-aspect [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) system known as \"Violet Banner\". This seeker lacked the sensitivity of the PbTe model and did not offer general all-aspect capability; while it worked against supersonic targets warmed by skin friction, it would not work against subsonic targets and required a tail-aspect in these cases.<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/aveeltg.html The English Electric (BAC) Lightning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This loss in performance was offset to some degree through a greatly increased the [[field of view]] to 60&nbsp;degrees. Firestreak's tube-powered electronics were replaced by [[transistor]]ized versions, which greatly improved reliability and eliminated the need for continual cooling. {{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nWith the warhead moved forward and the guidance electronics now taking up less room, the warhead was enlarged to 31&nbsp;kg (68.3&nbsp;lb) from Firestreak's already prodigious 22.7&nbsp;kg (50&nbsp;lb). It also used an [[expanding-rod warhead]] in place of the earlier blast fragmentation type. This move also left room at the rear of the fuselage for one of the two rows of the IR [[proximity fuse]], improving its view of targets. The new \"Green Garland\" fuse required smaller rectangular \"windows\", compared to the Firestreak's triangular windows, further simplifying the layout.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe Red Top was faster<ref name=Boyne267>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267 Boyne, Walter J, ''Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia, Volume 1''], pub ABC-CLIO Inc, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57607-345-9}} p267.</ref> and had greater range and maneuvrability than the Firestreak, and its [[infrared seeker]] enabled a wider range of engagement angles. \"Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, Red Top and Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.\"<ref name=Black141>Black, Ian, ''The Last of the Lightnings'', pub PSL, 1996, {{ISBN|1-85260-541-3}}, p141.</ref>\n\n===Almost cancelled===\nAlthough Red Top was a relatively straightforward upgrade to Firestreak, [[Duncan Sandys]] almost cancelled it as well. He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Mk. II]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] entered service in the early 1960s and eliminated the need for [[interceptor aircraft]] altogether. The [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top's head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement is less when launched from Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting four Red Top on [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], likely the B.112 version that had been proposed to replace Sea Vixen for long-duration [[combat air patrol]].{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nIndependently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of [[Hawker Aircraft]] also considered using Red Top on the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]]. The concept fit the aircraft with a more powerful engine, added the [[AIRPASS]] radar from the Lightning, and carried a pair of Red Top missiles.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Testing and service===\n[[File:Red Top.jpg|right|thumb|Red Top on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford|RAF Museum Cosford]].]]\n[[File:Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile mounted on an [[English Electric Lightning]] at the [[RAF Museum]] at [[Hendon]], [[London]]. ]]\n\nRed Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Vesta program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service on both the Lightning and Sea Vixen in [[1964 in aviation|1964]]. It remained in service until the final retirement of the Lightning in [[1988 in aviation|1988]].<ref>Gibson 2007, p. 41, 42</ref> Unusually, the missile that the Red Top was intended to replace \u2013 Firestreak \u2013 also remained in service on the Lightning until 1988.
