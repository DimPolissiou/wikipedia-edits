The Brindabellas are visible to the west of Canberra and form an important part of the city's landscape.\n\n==Location and features==\nThe Brindabella Range is located in the northern tip of the [[Australian Alps]] [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia|bioregion]], marking the dividing line with the southern tip of the [[South Eastern Highlands]] bioregion and the eastern limits of the [[Riverina]]. The northern point of the range is [[Mount Coree]], situated {{convert|34|km}} west-northwest of Canberra. From this point the range heads generally south, towards the eastern watershed of the [[Murrumbidgee River]], in a line that marks the western edge of the ACT border with NSW. The most southern point of the range is at Bimberi Gap on the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales border.

There are small areas of [[Tertiary]] [[basalt]] with buried river gravels and lake sediments. The typical characteristics of the range include low-relief high plains with steep margins and slopes and fault aligned river valleys with deep gorges and waterfalls. Soils in the range change with altitude. At lower levels in forests, texture contrast soils are the norm. In the sub-alpine snow gum areas deep gradational soils with moderate amounts of organic matter are common.<ref name=alps>{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/nature/australianAlps.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Bioregions of New South Wales \u2013 their biodiversity, conservation and history - Chapter 10.

The Brindabellas are visible to the west of Canberra and form an important part of the city's landscape.\n\n==Location and features==\nThe Brindabella Range is located in the northern tip of the [[Australian Alps]] [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia|bioregion]], marking the dividing line with the southern tip of the [[South Eastern Highlands]] bioregion and the eastern limits of the [[Riverina]]. The northern point of the range is [[Mount Coree]], situated {{convert|34|km}} west-northwest of Canberra. From this point the range heads generally south, towards the eastern watershed of the [[Murrumbidgee River]], in a line that marks the western edge of the ACT border with NSW. The most southern point of the range is at Bimberi Gap on the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales border. The range is located adjacent to the Bag Range, Baldy Range, Codys Ridge, Dingi Dingi Ridge and Webbs Ridge.<ref name=bonzle>{{cite web |url=http://www.bonzle.com/c/a?a=p&p=12296&cmd=sp |title=Map of Brindabella Range, NSW |work=Bonzle Digital Atlas of Australia |accessdate=4 April 2014 }}</ref> [[Scabby Range]] and Bimberi Range lie to the south<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://placenames.fsdf.org.au/|title=Place Names Australian Foundation Data|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>.\n\nThe [[geology]] of the range comprises block-faulted [[granite]]s and [[Paleozoic|Palaeozoic]] [[metamorphic rock]]s. There are small areas of [[Tertiary]] [[basalt]] with buried river gravels and lake sediments. The typical characteristics of the range include low-relief high plains with steep margins and slopes and fault aligned river valleys with deep gorges and waterfalls. Soils in the range change with altitude. At lower levels in forests, texture contrast soils are the norm. In the sub-alpine snow gum areas deep gradational soils with moderate amounts of organic matter are common.<ref name=alps>{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/nature/australianAlps.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Bioregions of New South Wales \u2013 their biodiversity, conservation and history - Chapter 10.

Low elevations with dry aspects carry red stringybark, white gum, broad-leaved peppermint, candlebark and brittle gum. Moist sites have alpine ash, mountain gum, narrow-leaved peppermint, manna gum and brown barrel, with tree ferns, blackwood and sassafras in gullies. Between {{convert|1000|-|1500|m}} alpine ash and mountain gum dominate and abruptly change to sub-alpine snow gum woodlands, heath, grasslands and bogs between {{convert|1500|-|1800|m}}. Common species include snow grasses, leafy bossiaea, yellow kunzea, alpine pepper and sphagnum bogs, with candle heath and swamp heath. Alpine herbfield and rare feldmark communities are found above the tree line at {{convert|1800|m}}. Common species include prickly snow grass, alpine wallaby grass, silver snow daisy, ribbony grass, white purslane, eyebrights, gentians and buttercups.

It is traversed by both [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] and the former [[Ontario Highway 2|Highway 2]].  The west end of the [[Murray Canal]] that leads east to the [[Bay of Quinte]] is at the east end of the town.\n\nThe land upon which the present day town of Brighton is situated originally belonged to the Mississauga (Anishinaabe-speaking) peoples.<ref>Copy of the treaty made October 31, 1923 between his Majesty the King and the Chippewa Indians of Christian Island, Georgina Island and Rama Reprinted 1967. \u00a9Roger Duhamel, F.R.S.C..

However, in recent years, many of the original orchards in the area have been partially removed, to make way for the steadily growing population, and more profitable agricultural produce, such as wheat, corn and soybeans. In late September, Brighton is host to [[Brighton Applefest|Applefest]], its largest yearly festival.\n\nThe Municipality of Brighton (formed on January 1, 2001, through an amalgamation of the former Town of Brighton and Brighton Township) is home to over 11,000 inhabitants,<ref name=\"census2016\"/> with a higher than average percentage of those retired. This is common, as the quiet, clean and friendly atmosphere of many smaller towns near Lake Ontario tend to draw the elderly as popular places for retirement living.\n\n[[Presqu'ile Provincial Park]], just south of the town centre, is one of Brighton's most popular attractions.

It is traversed by both [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] and the former [[Ontario Highway 2|Highway 2]].  The west end of the [[Murray Canal]] that leads east to the [[Bay of Quinte]] is at the east end of the town.\n\nThe land upon which the present day town of Brighton is situated originally belonged to the Mississauga (Anishinaabe-speaking) peoples<ref>Copy of the treaty made October 31, 1923 between his Majesty the King and the Chippewa Indians of Christian Island, Georgina Island and Rama Reprinted 1967. \u00a9Roger Duhamel, F.R.S.C..

However, in recent years, many of the original orchards in the area have been partially removed, to make way for the steadily growing population, and more profitable agricultural produce, such as wheat, corn and soybeans. In late September, Brighton is host to [[Brighton Applefest|Applefest]], its largest yearly festival.\n\nThe Municipality of Brighton (formed on January 1, 2001, through an amalgamation of the former Town of Brighton and Brighton Township) is home to over 11,000 inhabitants,<ref name=\"census2016\"/> with a higher than average percentage of those retired. This is common, as the quiet, clean and friendly atmosphere of many smaller towns near Lake Ontario tend to draw the elderly as popular places for retirement living.\n\n[[Presqu'ile Provincial Park]], just south of the town centre, is one of Brighton's most popular attractions. The park is noted for [[birdwatching|bird-watching]] and other nature-oriented activities.

Brief interventions are a technique used to initiate change for an unhealthy or risky behaviour such as smoking, lack of exercise or [[alcohol misuse]]. This page primarily describes brief interventions as applied to alcohol. As an alcohol intervention it is typically targeted to non-dependent drinkers, or drinkers who might be experiencing problems but are not seeking treatment.<ref>National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

This is then followed by some degree of feedback on this assessment. Alcohol Brief Interventions can be brief, such as delivered in a single session, or extended with multiple components or designed to be used multiple times.\n\nIt works in two ways:\n*by getting people to think differently about their alcohol use so that they begin to think about or make changes in their alcohol consumption.\n*by providing those who choose to drink with skills that allow them to consume alcoholic beverages in a safer way.\n\n==FRAMES==\nFor alcohol misuse, the following elements have been identified as particularly important, and forming the acronym ''FRAMES'':<ref name=\"BienMiller1993\">{{cite journal|last1=Bien|first1=Thomas H.|last2=Miller|first2=William R.|last3=Tonigan|first3=J. Scott|title=Brief interventions for alcohol problems: a review|journal=Addiction|volume=88|issue=3|year=1993|pages=315\u2013336|issn=0965-2140|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1993.tb00820.x}}</ref>\n*''F''eedback on the risk for alcohol problems\n*''R''esponsibility: where the individual with alcohol misuse is responsible for change\n*''A''dvice: about reduction or explicit direction to change\n*''M''enu: providing a variety of strategies for change\n*''E''mpathy, with a warm, reflective, empathic and understanding approach\n*''S''elf-efficacy of the misusing person in making a change\n\n==Motivational interviewing==\nBrief interventions are based on [[motivational interviewing]] techniques.\n\nMotivational interviewing is a technique which aims to be both non-judgmental and non-confrontational. Its success depends largely on the presentation of objective feedback based on information provided by an individual. The technique involves acknowledgement that individuals who attend a counselling session, assessment or prevention program may be at different levels of readiness to change their alcohol consumption patterns, including:\n\n*No perception of any alcohol consumption problem \n*Realisation of alcohol consumption problem with no corresponding action \n*Current active addressing of alcohol consumption problem \n*Ongoing maintenance of reduced consumption\n\nThe technique attempts to increase a person's awareness of the potential problems caused, consequences experienced, and risks faced as a result of patterns of alcohol consumption. As feedback is presented, the clinician or program provider may foster the development of discrepancies between the perception that someone has of themselves and the reality of that person's situation.\n\nThis technique acknowledges that people may come to a counseling session, an assessment, or a prevention program at different levels of readiness to change their drinking behavior. Some people may have never thought of making changes in their drinking, others may have thought about it but not taken steps to change it, some may be actively trying to cut down, and others may have already cut down, and succeeded in maintaining reduced consumption. Motivational Interviewing attempts to address the specific issues that people are facing at any particular stage.\n\nIn short, the strategy seeks to prompt individuals to think differently about their use of alcohol and ultimately consider what might be gained through change.\n\n==Feedback==\nWhen the assessment is complete, people receive personalized feedback about their alcohol consumption and related behaviors. For instance, 'feedback' highlights that the person's drinking may be placing their health at risk, and is above recommended consumption guidelines. In groups (e.g., a social fraternity or sorority), feedback can be given based on data collected from group members prior to an intervention program. Some researchers have used mailed feedback after collecting data on a questionnaire such that no face-to-face interaction actually occurs.\n\n==Skills training==\nSkills training programs develop skills for consuming alcohol in a safer way. One of the limitations of information-only programs is that they may raise awareness and information about the effects of a substance, but leave the individual to make behavioural changes themselves.\n\nSkills training programs can work well with motivational interviewing techniques, as skills training programs work to provide the individual with the skills to make these changes in their drinking behavior, as the motivational interviewing simultaneously works to make the individual aware of their behaviour.\n\nIn doing so, they provide harm reduction strategies for those who choose to drink. This means that moderate drinking goals may also be considered, recognising that any steps toward safer alcohol consumption are steps in the right direction. Consequently, while abstinence may be the optimal outcome for some people, skills for drinking in a way that will minimize harm can be considered if abstinence is not viewed as realistic, attainable, or attractive. For example, blood alcohol concentration level estimation training enables people to set limits for moderate goals that are unique to their gender, weight, and time spent drinking. Teaching practical strategies for reaching these limits, such as spacing one's drinks, pacing oneself, alternating alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, consuming food before drinking and drinking for promote success.\n\n==Evidence==\nA range of systematic reviews published by Cochrane have described a small to medium effect size showing change in primarily alcohol use as a result of these interventions.

Brief interventions are a technique used to initiate change for an unhealthy or risky behaviour such as smoking, lack of exercise or [[alcohol misuse]]. This page primarily describes brief interventions as applied to alcohol. As an alcohol intervention it is typically targeted to non-dependent drinkers, or drinkers who might be experiencing problems but are not seeking treatment<ref>National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

This is then followed by some degree of feedback on this assessment. Alcohol Brief Interventions can be brief, such as delivered in a single session, or extended with multiple components or designed to be used multiple times.\n\nIt works in two ways:\n*by getting people to think differently about their alcohol use so that they begin to think about or make changes in their alcohol consumption.\n*by providing those who choose to drink with skills that allow them to consume alcoholic beverages in a safer way.\n\n==FRAMES==\nFor alcohol misuse, the following elements have been identified as particularly important, and forming the acronym ''FRAMES'':<ref name=\"BienMiller1993\">{{cite journal|last1=Bien|first1=Thomas H.|last2=Miller|first2=William R.|last3=Tonigan|first3=J. Scott|title=Brief interventions for alcohol problems: a review|journal=Addiction|volume=88|issue=3|year=1993|pages=315\u2013336|issn=0965-2140|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1993.tb00820.x}}</ref>\n*''F''eedback on the risk for alcohol problems\n*''R''esponsibility: where the individual with alcohol misuse is responsible for change\n*''A''dvice: about reduction or explicit direction to change\n*''M''enu: providing a variety of strategies for change\n*''E''mpathy, with a warm, reflective, empathic and understanding approach\n*''S''elf-efficacy of the misusing person in making a change\n\n==Motivational interviewing==\nBrief interventions are based on [[motivational interviewing]] techniques.\n\nMotivational interviewing is a technique which aims to be both non-judgmental and non-confrontational. Its success depends largely on the presentation of objective feedback based on information provided by an individual. The technique involves acknowledgement that individuals who attend a counselling session, assessment or prevention program may be at different levels of readiness to change their alcohol consumption patterns, including:\n\n*No perception of any alcohol consumption problem \n*Realisation of alcohol consumption problem with no corresponding action \n*Current active addressing of alcohol consumption problem \n*Ongoing maintenance of reduced consumption\n\nThe technique attempts to increase a person's awareness of the potential problems caused, consequences experienced, and risks faced as a result of patterns of alcohol consumption. As feedback is presented, the clinician or program provider may foster the development of discrepancies between the perception that someone has of themselves and the reality of that person's situation.\n\nThis technique acknowledges that people may come to a counseling session, an assessment, or a prevention program at different levels of readiness to change their drinking behavior. Some people may have never thought of making changes in their drinking, others may have thought about it but not taken steps to change it, some may be actively trying to cut down, and others may have already cut down, and succeeded in maintaining reduced consumption. Motivational Interviewing attempts to address the specific issues that people are facing at any particular stage.\n\nIn short, the strategy seeks to prompt individuals to think differently about their use of alcohol and ultimately consider what might be gained through change.\n\n==Feedback==\nWhen the assessment is complete, people receive personalized feedback about their alcohol consumption and related behaviors. For instance, 'feedback' highlights that the person's drinking may be placing their health at risk, and is above recommended consumption guidelines. In groups (e.g., a social fraternity or sorority), feedback can be given based on data collected from group members prior to an intervention program. Some researchers have used mailed feedback after collecting data on a questionnaire such that no face-to-face interaction actually occurs.\n\n==Skills training==\nSkills training programs develop skills for consuming alcohol in a safer way. One of the limitations of information-only programs is that they may raise awareness and information about the effects of a substance, but leave the individual to make behavioural changes themselves.\n\nSkills training programs can work well with motivational interviewing techniques, as skills training programs work to provide the individual with the skills to make these changes in their drinking behavior, as the motivational interviewing simultaneously works to make the individual aware of their behaviour.\n\nIn doing so, they provide harm reduction strategies for those who choose to drink. This means that moderate drinking goals may also be considered, recognising that any steps toward safer alcohol consumption are steps in the right direction. Consequently, while abstinence may be the optimal outcome for some people, skills for drinking in a way that will minimize harm can be considered if abstinence is not viewed as realistic, attainable, or attractive. For example, blood alcohol concentration level estimation training enables people to set limits for moderate goals that are unique to their gender, weight, and time spent drinking. Teaching practical strategies for reaching these limits, such as spacing one's drinks, pacing oneself, alternating alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, consuming food before drinking and drinking for promote success.\n\n==Evidence==\nA range of systematic reviews published by Cochrane have described a small to medium effect size showing change in primarily alcohol use as a result of these interventions.

The stress of his job eventually lead Brian to become an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], and he frequently lashed out at those around him. While drunk at work one day, Brian accidentally overloaded some machinery, causing an explosion that cost him his job. Despite his vow never to have children, Brian impregnated Rebecca, who gave birth to their only child, Robert Bruce Banner. Brian believed Bruce had inherited both the \"monster gene\" and [[genetic defect]]s due to the accident in Los Alamos, so he ignored him completely and attempted to keep Rebecca away from him. He frequently left Bruce in the care of the neglectful Nurse Meachum. When Bruce woke up one [[Christmas]] morning and opened a present from his mother, a complex model, he assembled it easily, despite his young age. This convinced Brian that his assumptions about Bruce were correct.

Much of the biographical information about Plotinus comes from [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s preface to his edition of Plotinus' ''[[Enneads]]''. His [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] writings have inspired centuries of [[Paganism|Pagan]], [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]], [[Christian philosophy|Christian]], [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]], and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic]] [[metaphysics|metaphysicians]] and [[mysticism|mystics]], including developing precepts that influence mainstream theological concepts within religions, such as his work on duality of the One in two metaphysical states. This concept is similar to the Christian notion of Jesus being both god and man, a foundational idea in [[Christian theology]].\n\n== Biography ==\n[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] reported that Plotinus was 66 years old when he died in 270, the second year of the reign of the emperor [[Claudius II]], thus giving us the year of his teacher's birth as around 205. [[Eunapius]] reported that Plotinus was born in the [[Lycopolis (Delta)|Deltaic Lycopolis]] in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], which has led to speculations that he may have been either native [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] Egyptian,<ref>Bilolo, M.: ''La notion de \u00ab l\u2019Un \u00bb dans les Enn\u00e9ades de Plotin et dans les Hymnes th\u00e9bains.

This distrust extended to the body, including his own; it is reported by Porphyry that at one point he refused to have his portrait painted, presumably for much the same reasons of dislike. Likewise Plotinus never discussed his ancestry, childhood, or his place or date of birth<ref name=\":0\" />. From all accounts his personal and social life exhibited the highest moral and spiritual standards.\n\nPlotinus took up the study of [[philosophy]] at the age of twenty-seven, around the year 232, and travelled to [[Alexandria]] to study. There he was dissatisfied with every teacher he encountered until an acquaintance suggested he listen to the ideas of [[Ammonius Saccas]]. Upon hearing Ammonius lecture, he declared to his friend, \"this was the man I was looking for,\" and began to study intently under his new instructor. Besides Ammonius, Plotinus was also influenced by the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], and various [[Stoicism|Stoics]].\n\n=== Expedition to Persia and return to Rome ===\nAfter spending the next eleven years in Alexandria, he then decided, at the age of around 38, to investigate the philosophical teachings of the [[Iranian philosophy|Persian philosophers]] and the [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]].<ref>Porphyry, ''On the Life of Plotinus and the Order of His Books'', Ch. 3 (in Armstrong's Loeb translation, \"he became eager to make acquaintance with the Persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the Indians\").</ref> In the pursuit of this endeavor he left Alexandria and joined the army of [[Gordian III]] as it marched on Persia. However, [[Battle of Misiche|the campaign]] was a failure, and on Gordian's eventual death Plotinus found himself abandoned in a hostile land, and only with difficulty found his way back to safety in [[Antioch]].\n\nAt the age of forty, during the reign of [[Philip the Arab]], he came to [[Rome]], where he stayed for most of the remainder of his life.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Beauty and the mystic : Plotinus and Hawkins|last=Leete, Helen, 1938-|isbn=9780987524836|location=Epping, N.S.W|oclc=967937243}}</ref> There he attracted a number of students. His innermost circle included [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Amelius|Amelius Gentilianus]] of [[Tuscany]], the Senator [[Castricius Firmus]], and [[Eustochius of Alexandria]], a doctor who devoted himself to learning from Plotinus and attending to him until his death.  Other students included: [[Zethos the Arab|Zethos]], an [[Arab]] by ancestry who died before Plotinus, leaving him a legacy and some land; [[Disciples of Plotinus|Zoticus]], a critic and poet; [[Paulinus (follower of Plotinus)|Paulinus]], a doctor of [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]]; and [[Serapion (follower of Plotinus)|Serapion]] from Alexandria. He had students amongst the [[Roman Senate]] beside Castricius, such as [[Marcellus Orontius]], [[Sabinillus]], and [[Rogantianus]]. Women were also numbered amongst his students, including Gemina, in whose house he lived during his residence in Rome, and her daughter, also Gemina; and Amphiclea, the wife of Ariston the son of [[Iamblichus]].<ref>Porphyry, ''Vita Plotini'', 9. See also Emma C. Clarke, [[John M. Dillon]], and Jackson P. Hershbell (1999), ''Iamblichus on The Mysteries'', page xix. SBL. who say that \"to gain some credible chronology, one assumes that Ariston married Amphicleia some time after Plotinus's death\"</ref> Finally, Plotinus was a correspondent of the philosopher [[Cassius Dionysius Longinus|Cassius Longinus]].\n\n=== Later life ===\nWhile in Rome Plotinus also gained the respect of the Emperor [[Gallienus]] and his wife [[Cornelia Salonina|Salonina]]. At one point Plotinus attempted to interest Gallienus in rebuilding an abandoned settlement in [[Campania]], known as the 'City of Philosophers', where the inhabitants would live under the constitution set out in [[Plato]]'s ''Laws''. An Imperial subsidy was never granted, for reasons unknown to Porphyry, who reports the incident.\n\nPorphyry subsequently went to live in [[Sicily]], where word reached him that his former teacher had died. The philosopher spent his final days in seclusion on an estate in [[Campania]] which his friend Zethos had bequeathed him. According to the account of Eustochius, who attended him at the end, Plotinus' final words were: \"Try to raise the divine in yourselves to the divine in the all.\"<ref>Mark Edwards, ''Neoplatonic Saints: The Lives of Plotinus and Proclus by Their Students'', Liverpool University Press, 2000, p. 4 n. 20.</ref> Eustochius records that a snake crept under the bed where Plotinus lay, and slipped away through a hole in the wall; at the same moment the philosopher died.\n\nPlotinus wrote the essays that became the ''[[Enneads]]'' (from Greek ''\u1f10\u03bd\u03bd\u03ad\u03b1'' (enn\u00e9a), or group of nine) over a period of several years from ''[[Circa|ca.]]'' 253 until a few months before his death seventeen years later. Porphyry makes note that the ''Enneads'', before being compiled and arranged by himself, were merely the enormous collection of notes and essays which Plotinus used in his lectures and debates, rather than a formal book. Plotinus was unable to revise his own work due to his poor eyesight, yet his writings required extensive editing, according to Porphyry: his master's handwriting was atrocious, he did not properly separate his words, and he cared little for niceties of spelling. Plotinus intensely disliked the editorial process, and turned the task to Porphyry, who not only polished them but put them into the arrangement we now have.\n\n== Major ideas ==\n\n=== One ===\n{{See also|Substance theory}}\nPlotinus taught that there is a supreme, totally transcendent \"[[Henology|One]]\", containing no division, multiplicity, or distinction; beyond all categories of [[being]] and non-being. His \"One\" \"cannot be any existing thing\", nor is it merely the sum of all things (compare the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] doctrine of disbelief in non-material existence), but \"is prior to all existents\". Plotinus identified his \"One\" with the concept of 'Good' and the principle of 'Beauty'. (I.6.9)\n\nHis \"One\" concept encompassed thinker and object. Even the self-contemplating intelligence (the [[noesis]] of the [[nous]]) must contain [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]]. \"Once you have uttered 'The Good,' add no further thought: by any addition, and in proportion to that addition, you introduce a deficiency.\" (III.8.11) Plotinus denies [[sentience]], self-awareness or any other action (''ergon'') to the One (\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f1d\u03bd, ''to En''; V.6.6). Rather, if we insist on describing it further, we must call the One a sheer potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') without which nothing could exist. (III.8.10) As Plotinus explains in both places and elsewhere (e.g. V.6.3), it is impossible for the One to be Being or a self-aware Creator God. At (V.6.4), Plotinus compared the One to \"light\", the Divine Intellect/[[Nous]] (\u039d\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, ''Nous''; first will towards Good) to the \"Sun\", and lastly the Soul (\u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae, ''[[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]]'') to the \"Moon\" whose light is merely a \"derivative conglomeration of light from the 'Sun'\". The first light could exist without any celestial body.\n\nThe One, being beyond all attributes including being and non-being, is the source of the world\u2014but not through any act of creation, willful or otherwise, since activity cannot be ascribed to the unchangeable, immutable One. Plotinus argues instead that the multiple cannot exist without the simple. The \"less perfect\" must, of necessity, \"emanate\", or issue forth, from the \"perfect\" or \"more perfect\". Thus, all of \"creation\" emanates from the One in succeeding stages of lesser and lesser perfection. These stages are not temporally isolated, but occur throughout time as a constant process.\n\nThe One is not just an intellectual concept but something that can be experienced, an experience where one goes beyond all multiplicity.<ref>Stace, W. T. (1960) ''The Teachings of the Mystics'', New York, Signet, pp. 110\u2013123</ref> Plotinus writes, \"We ought not even to say that he will ''see'', but he will ''be'' that which he sees, if indeed it is possible any longer to distinguish between seer and seen, and not boldly to affirm that the two are one.\"<ref>Stace, W. T. (1960) ''The Teachings of the Mystics'', New York, Signet, p. 122</ref>\n\n=== Emanation by the One ===\nSuperficially considered, Plotinus seems to offer an alternative to the orthodox [[Christianity|Christian]] notion of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (out of nothing), although Plotinus never mentions Christianity in any of his works. The metaphysics of emanation (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03ae ''aporrhoe'' (\u0399\u0399.3.2) or \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 ''aporrhoia'' (II.3.11)), however, just like the metaphysics of Creation, confirms the absolute transcendence of the One or of the Divine, as the source of the Being of all things that yet remains transcendent of them in its own nature; the One is in no way affected or diminished by these emanations, just as the Christian God in no way is affected by some sort of exterior \"nothingness\". Plotinus, using a venerable analogy that would become crucial for the (largely Neoplatonic) metaphysics of developed Christian thought, likens the One to the [[Sun]] which emanates light indiscriminately without thereby diminishing itself, or reflection in a mirror which in no way diminishes or otherwise alters the object being reflected.<ref>[https://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/ Plotinus (204\u2014270 C.E.)]</ref>\n\nThe first emanation is ''[[Nous]]'' (Divine Mind, ''[[Logos]]'', Order, Thought, Reason), identified metaphorically with the [[Demiurge]] in Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''. It is the first [[will (philosophy)|Will]] toward Good. From ''Nous'' proceeds the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|World Soul]], which Plotinus subdivides into upper and lower, identifying the lower aspect of Soul with [[nature]]. From the world soul proceeds individual [[human]] souls, and finally, matter, at the lowest level of [[chain of being|being]] and thus the least [[perfection|perfected]] level of the cosmos. Plotinus asserted the ultimately divine nature of material creation since it ultimately derives from the One, through the mediums of ''Nous'' and the world soul. It is by the Good or through beauty that we recognize the One, in material things and then in the [[substantial form|Forms]]. (I.6.6 and I.6.9)\n\nThe essentially devotional nature of Plotinus' philosophy may be further illustrated by his concept of attaining ecstatic union with the One (''[[henosis]]''). Porphyry relates that Plotinus attained such a union four times during the years he knew him. This may be related to [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], liberation, and other concepts of [[mysticism|mystical union]] common to many Eastern and Western traditions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lander|first=Janis|title=Spiritual Art and Art Education|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page= 76|isbn=9781134667895}}</ref>\n\n=== The true human and happiness ===\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The philosophy of Plotinus has always exerted a peculiar fascination upon those whose discontent with things as they are has led them to seek the realities behind what they took to be merely the appearances of the sense.\n |source = ''The philosophy of Plotinus: representative books from the Enneads'', p. vii<ref name=\"Plotinus1950\">{{cite book|author=Plotinus|title=The philosophy of Plotinus: representative books from the Enneads|url=https://archive.org/details/philosophyofplot032843mbp|accessdate=1 February 2012|year=1950|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|page=vii}}</ref>\n |width  = 30%\n |align  = right\n}}\nAuthentic human happiness for Plotinus consists of the true human identifying with that which is the best in the universe. Because happiness is beyond anything physical, Plotinus stresses the point that worldly fortune does not control true human happiness, and thus \u201c\u2026 there exists no single human being that does not either potentially or effectively possess this thing we hold to constitute happiness.\u201d (Enneads I.4.4) The issue of happiness is one of Plotinus\u2019 greatest imprints on Western thought, as he is one of the first to introduce the idea that [[eudaimonia]] (happiness) is attainable only within consciousness.\n\nThe true human is an incorporeal contemplative capacity of the soul, and superior to all things corporeal. It then follows that real human happiness is independent of the physical world. Real happiness is, instead, dependent on the metaphysical and authentic human being found in this highest capacity of Reason. \u201cFor man, and especially the Proficient, is not the Couplement of Soul and body: the proof is that man can be disengaged from the body and disdain its nominal goods.\u201d (Enneads I.4.14) The human who has achieved happiness will not be bothered by sickness, discomfort, etc., as his focus is on the greatest things. Authentic human happiness is the utilization of the most authentically human capacity of contemplation. Even in daily, physical action, the flourishing human\u2019s \u201c\u2026 Act is determined by the higher phase of the Soul.\u201d (Enneads III.4.6) Even in the most dramatic arguments Plotinus considers (if the Proficient is subject to extreme physical torture, for example), he concludes this only strengthens his claim of true happiness being metaphysical, as the truly happy human being would understand that which is being tortured is merely a body, not the conscious self, and happiness could persist.\n\nPlotinus offers a comprehensive description of his conception of a person who has achieved [[eudaimonia]]. \u201cThe perfect life\u201d involves a man who commands reason and contemplation. (Enneads I.4.4) A happy person will not sway between happy and sad, as many of Plotinus' contemporaries believed. Stoics, for example, question the ability of someone to be happy (presupposing happiness is contemplation) if they are mentally incapacitated or even asleep. Plotinus disregards this claim, as the soul and true human do not sleep or even exist in time, nor will a living human who has achieved eudaimonia suddenly stop using its greatest, most authentic capacity just because of the body\u2019s discomfort in the physical realm. \u201c\u2026 The Proficient\u2019s will is set always and only inward.\u201d (Enneads I.4.11)\n\nOverall, happiness for Plotinus is \"... a flight from this world's ways and things.\" (Theaet. 176) and a focus on the highest, i.e. Forms and the One.\n\n===Henosis===\n{{main|Henosis}}\n\nHenosis is the word for mystical \"oneness\", \"union\", or \"unity\" in classical Greek. In [[Platonism]], and especially [[Neoplatonism]], the goal of henosis is union with what is fundamental in reality: the One ([[wikt:\u03b5\u1f37\u03c2|\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f1d\u03bd]]), the Source, or [[Monism|Monad]].<ref>Stamatellos, Giannis.

SUNY Press, 2007, p. 37 {{ISBN|0791470628}}</ref>\n\nAs is specified in the writings of Plotinus on [[henology]], one can reach a state of [[tabula rasa]], a blank state where the individual may grasp or merge with The One.{{refn|group=note|Plotinus: <br>* \"Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul. To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One. (6.9.7)<br>* \"If he remembers who he became when he merged with the One, he will bear its image in himself. He was himself one, with no diversity in himself or his outward relations; for no movement was in him, no passion, no desire for another, once the ascent was accomplished. Nor indeed was there any reason or though, nor, if we dare say it, any trace of himself.\" (6.9.11)}} This absolute simplicity means that the nous or the person is then dissolved, completely absorbed back into the Monad. Here within the ''Enneads'' of Plotinus the Monad can be referred to as the Good above the demiurge.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">''[[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]]'' by Richard T.

All division is reconciled in the one; the final stage before reaching singularity, called duality (dyad), is completely reconciled in the Monad, Source or One (see [[monism]]). As the one source or substance of all things, the Monad is all encompassing. As infinite and indeterminate all is reconciled in the dunamis or one. It is the demiurge or second emanation that is the nous in Plotinus. It is the demiurge (creator, action, energy) or nous that \"perceives\" and therefore causes the force (potential or One) to manifest as energy, or the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]] called the material world. Nous as being; being and perception (intellect) manifest what is called soul ([[Gaia hypothesis|World Soul]]).<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nHenosis for Plotinus was defined in his works as a reversing of the ontological process of consciousness via [[meditation]] (in the Western mind to un[[Contemplation|contemplate]]) toward no thought ([[Nous]] or [[demiurge]]) and no division ([[Dyad (symbol)|dyad]]) within the individual (being). Plotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with [[Aristotle]] but also various World religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels. Plotinus' works have an [[ascetic]] character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as [[immanent]], with matter as essential to its being, having no true or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendential]] character or essence, substance or ousia (\u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1). This approach is called philosophical [[Idealism]].<ref>[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher: \"With Plotinus there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], ''idealism'' that had long been current in the [[East]] even at that time, for it taught ([[Enneads]], iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the [[soul]] has made the [[world]] by stepping from [[eternity]] into [[time]], with the explanation: 'For there is for this [[universe]] no other place than the soul or [[mind]]' (neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere).\" (''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume I, \"Fragments for the History of Philosophy,\" \u00a7 7)</ref>\n\n==Relation with contemporary philosophy and religion==\n\n=== Plotinus's Relation to Plato===\n{{see also|Allegorical interpretations of Plato}}\n\nFor several centuries after the [[Protestant Reformation]], Neo-Platonism was condemned as a decadent and 'oriental' distortion of Platonism. In a famous 1929 essay, [[E. R. Dodds]] showed that key conceptions of Neo-Platonism could be traced from their origin in Plato's dialogues, through his immediate followers (e.g., [[Speusippus]]) and the Neo-Pythagoreans, to Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists. Thus Plotinus' philosophy was, he argued, 'not the starting-point of Neo-Platonism but its intellectual culmination.'<ref>E. R. Dodds, 'The Parmenides of Plato and the Origin of the Neoplatonic One,' ''The Classical Quarterly'', v. 22, No. 3/4, 1928, pp. 129-142, esp. 140.</ref> Further research reinforced this view and by 1954 Merlan could say 'The present tendency is toward bridging rather than widening the gap separating Platonism from Neo-Platonism.'<ref>Philip Merlan, ''From Platonism to Neoplatonism'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1954, 1968), p. 3.</ref>\n\nSince the 1950s, the [[Plato's unwritten doctrines|T\u00fcbingen School]] of Plato interpretation has argued that the so-called 'unwritten doctrines' of Plato debated by Aristotle and the Early Academy strongly resemble Plotinus's metaphysics. In this case, the Neo-Platonic reading of Plato would be, at least in this central area, historically justified. This implies that Neo-Platonism is less of an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato's unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the T\u00fcbingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus's metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to the first generation of Plato's students. This confirms Plotinus' own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato's doctrines.<ref>Detlef Thiel: ''Die Philosophie des Xenokrates im Kontext der Alten Akademie'', M\u00fcnchen 2006, pp. 197ff. and note 64; Jens Halfwassen: ''Der Aufstieg zum Einen. ''</ref>\n\n=== Plotinus and the Gnostics ===\n{{See also|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism}}\n\nAt least two modern conferences within Hellenic philosophy fields of study have been held in order to address what Plotinus stated in his tract ''Against the Gnostics'' and to whom he was addressing it, in order to separate and clarify the events and persons involved in the origin of the term \"Gnostic\". From the dialogue, it appears that the word had an origin in the Platonic and Hellenistic tradition long before the group calling themselves \"Gnostics\"\u2014or the group covered under the modern term \"Gnosticism\"\u2014ever appeared. It would seem that this shift from Platonic to Gnostic usage has led many people to confusion. The strategy of sectarians taking [[Greek language|Greek]] terms from philosophical contexts and re-applying them to religious contexts was popular in [[Christianity]], the [[Cult of Isis]] and other ancient religious contexts including [[Hermetica|Hermetic]] ones (see [[Alexander of Abonutichus]] for an example).\n\nAccording to A. H. Armstrong, Plotinus and the [[neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] viewed Gnosticism{{clarification needed|date=October 2019}} as a form of heresy or [[sectarian]]ism to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophy of the Mediterranean and Middle East.{{refn|group=note|From Introduction to Against the Gnostics in Plotinus' Enneads as translated by A.

There were Gnostics among Plotinus's own friends, whom he had not succeeded in converting (Enneads ch.10 of this treatise) and he and his pupils devoted considerable time and energy to anti-Gnostic controversy (Life of Plotinus ch.16). He obviously considered Gnosticism an extremely dangerous influence, likely to pervert the minds even of members of his own circle. It is impossible to attempt to give an account of Gnosticism here. By far the best discussion of what the particular group of Gnostics Plotinus knew believed is M. Puech's admirable contribution to Entretiens Hardt V (Les Sourcesde Plotin).

Armstrong, pp. 220\u2013222:<br />Ridiculous arrogance of the Gnostics who refuse to acknowledge the hierarchy of created gods and spirits and say that they alone are sons of God and superior to the heavens (Enneads ch. 9)}} Armstrong believed that Plotinus also attacks them as elitist and blasphemous to Plato for the Gnostics despising the material world and its maker.{{refn|group=note|They claim to be a privileged caste of beings, in whom alone God is interested, and who are saved not by their own efforts but by some dramatic and arbitrary divine proceeding; and this, Plotinus says, leads to immorality. Worst of all, they despise and hate the material universe and deny its goodness and the goodness of its maker. This for a Platonist is utter blasphemy, and all the worse because it obviously derives to some extent from the sharply other-worldly side of Plato's own teaching (e.g. in the ''[[Phaedo]]''). At this point in his attack Plotinus comes very close in some ways to the orthodox Christian opponents of Gnosticism, who also insist that this world is the good work of God in his goodness. But, here as on the question of salvation, the doctrine which Plotinus is defending is as sharply opposed on other ways to orthodox Christianity as to Gnosticism: for he maintains not only the goodness of the material universe but also its eternity and its divinity. The idea that the universe could have a beginning and end is inseparably connected in his mind with the idea that the divine action in making it is arbitrary and irrational. And to deny the divinity (though a subordinate and dependent divinity) of the World-Soul, and of those noblest of embodied living beings the heavenly bodies, seems to him both blasphemous and unreasonable. Pages 220\u2013222}}\n\nFor decades, Armstrong's was the only translation available of Plotinus. For this reason, his claims were authoritative. However, a modern translation by Lloyd P. Gerson doesn't necessarily support all of Armstrong's views. Unlike Armstrong, Gerson didn't find Plotinus to be so vitriolic against the Gnostics.<ref name=\"gerson\">{{cite book |title=Plotinus: The Enneads |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107001770 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCw2yAEACAAJ |language=en}}</ref> According to Gerson:\n{{quote|As Plotinus himself tells us, at the time of this treatise\u2019s composition some of his friends were \u2018attached\u2019 to Gnostic doctrine, and he believed that this attachment was harmful. So he sets out here a number of objections and corrections. Some of these are directed at very specific tenets of Gnosticism, e.g. the introduction of a \u2018new earth\u2019 or a principle of \u2018Wisdom\u2019, but the general thrust of this treatise has a much broader scope. The Gnostics are very critical of the sensible universe and its contents, and as a Platonist, Plotinus must share this critical attitude to some extent. But here he makes his case that the proper understanding of the highest principles and emanation forces us to respect the sensible world as the best possible imitation of the intelligible world.}}\n\nPlotinus seems to direct his attacks at a very specific sect of Gnostics, most notably a sect of Christian Gnostics that held anti-polytheistic and anti-daemon views, and that preached salvation was possible without struggle.<ref name=\"gerson\" /> At one point, Plotinus makes clear that his major grudge is the way Gnostics 'misused' Plato's teachings, and not their own teachings themselves:\n{{quote|There are no hard feelings if they tell us in which respects they intend to disagree with Plato [...] Rather, whatever strikes them as their own distinct views in comparison with the Greeks\u2019, these views \u2013 as well as the views that contradict them \u2013 should be forthrightly set out on their own in a considerate and philosophical manner.}}\n\nThe Neoplatonic movement (though Plotinus would have simply referred to himself as a philosopher of Plato) seems to be motivated by the desire of Plotinus to revive the pagan philosophical tradition.{{refn|group=note|\"... as Plotinus had endeavored to revive the religious spirit of paganism\".<ref>''A Biographical History of Philosophy'', by George Henry Lewes Published 1892, G. Routledge & Sons, LTD, p. 294</ref>}} Plotinus was not claiming to innovate with the ''Enneads'', but to clarify aspects of the works of Plato that he considered misrepresented or misunderstood.<ref name=\"Stanford1\" /> Plotinus does not claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a tradition.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-dionysius-areopagite/ Pseudo-Dionysius] in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> Plotinus referred to tradition as a way to interpret Plato's intentions. Because the teachings of Plato were for members of the academy rather than the general public, it was easy for outsiders to misunderstand Plato's meaning. However, Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as [[misotheism]] or [[Eutheism and dystheism|dystheism]] of the creator God as an answer to the [[problem of evil]]) as the targets of his criticism.\n\n=== Against causal astrology ===\nPlotinus seems to be one of the first to argue against the still popular notion of causal [[astrology]]. In the late tractate 2.3, \"Are the stars causes?\", Plotinus makes the argument that specific stars influencing one's fortune (a common [[Hellenistic]] theme) attributes [[irrationality]] to a perfect universe, and invites moral depravity. He does, however, claim the stars and planets are [[Soul (spirit)|ensouled]], as witnessed by their [[Apparent retrograde motion|movement]].\n\n== Influence ==\n\n=== Ancient world ===\nThe emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] was deeply influenced by Neoplatonism,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religious Competition in the Greco-Roman World|last=Dingeldein|first=Laura B.|publisher=SBL Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0884141587|editor-last=DesRosiers|editor-first=Nathaniel P.|location=Atlanta|pages=119\u2013129|chapter=Julian's Philosophy and His Religious Program|editor-last2=Vuong|editor-first2=Lily C.}}</ref> as was [[Hypatia|Hypatia of Alexandria]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hypatia|title=Hypatia|last=[[Michael A.

In ''A History of Western Philosophy'', philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that:\n{{quote|To the Christian, the Other World was the Kingdom of Heaven, to be enjoyed after death; to the Platonist, it was the eternal world of ideas, the real world as opposed to that of illusory appearance. Christian theologians combined these points of view, and embodied much of the philosophy of Plotinus. [...] Plotinus, accordingly, is historically important as an influence in moulding the Christianity of the Middle Ages and of theology.<ref>\"A History of Western Philosophy.\" Bertrand Russell. Simon and Schuster, INC. 1945. pp. 284\u2013285</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox]] position on ''energy,'' for example, is often contrasted with the position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and in part this is attributed to varying interpretations of [[Aristotle]] and Plotinus, either through [[Thomas Aquinas]] for the Roman Catholics or [[Gregory Palamas]] for the Orthodox Christians.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Islam ===\nNeoplatonism and the ideas of Plotinus influenced medieval Islam as well, since the [[Sunni]] [[Abbasid]]s fused Greek concepts into sponsored state texts, and found great influence amongst the [[Ismaili]] [[Shia]]<ref name=\"halm 176\">Heinz Halm, ''Shi'ism'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 176.</ref> and Persian philosophers as well, such as Muhammad al-Nasafi and [[Abu Yaqub Sijistani]]. By the 11th century, Neoplatonism was adopted by the [[Fatimid]] state of Egypt, and taught by their [[da'i (Islam)|da'i]].<ref name=\"halm 176\"/> Neoplatonism was brought to the Fatimid court by [[Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani]], although his teachings differed from Nasafi and Sijistani, who were more aligned with the original teachings of Plotinus.<ref name=\"halm 177\">Heinz Halm, ''Shi'ism'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 177.</ref> The teachings of Kirmani in turn influenced philosophers such as [[Nasir Khusraw]] of Persia.<ref name=\"halm 177\"/>\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs with Islam and Christianity, Neoplatonism in general and Plotinus in particular influenced speculative thought. Notable thinkers expressing Neoplatonist themes are [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] (Latin: Avicebron) and Moses ben Maimon (Latin: [[Maimonides]]). As with Islam and Christianity, apophatic theology and the privative nature of evil are two prominent themes that such thinkers picked up from either Plotinus or his successors.\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn the [[Renaissance]] the philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] set up an Academy under the patronage of [[Cosimo de Medici]] in [[Florence]], mirroring that of Plato. His work was of great importance in reconciling the philosophy of Plato directly with Christianity. One of his most distinguished pupils was [[Pico della Mirandola]], author of ''An Oration On the Dignity of Man''.\n\n=== England ===\nIn England, Plotinus was the cardinal influence on the 17th-century school of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], and on numerous writers from [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] to [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] and [[Kathleen Raine]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Michaud |first1=Derek |title=Reason Turned into Sense: John Smith on Spiritual Sensation |date=2017 |publisher=Peeters |pages=102-105, 114, 115, 129, 137, 146, 153, 154, 155, 172, 174, 175, 177-178, 180, 181, 181, 184, 185, 188, 195 |url=https://g.co/kgs/BUWJsx}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.yeatsvision.com/Plotinus.html |title = W.

Much of the biographical information about Plotinus comes from [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s preface to his edition of Plotinus' ''[[Enneads]]''. His [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] writings have inspired centuries of [[Paganism|Pagan]], [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]], [[Christian philosophy|Christian]], [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]], and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic]] [[metaphysics|metaphysicians]] and [[mysticism|mystics]], including developing precepts that influence mainstream theological concepts within religions, such as his work on duality of the One in two metaphysical states. This concept is similar to the Christian notion of Jesus being both god and man, a foundational idea in [[Christian theology]].\n\n== Biography ==\n[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] reported that Plotinus was 66 years old when he died in 270, the second year of the reign of the emperor [[Claudius II]], thus giving us the year of his teacher's birth as around 205. [[Eunapius]] reported that Plotinus was born in the [[Lycopolis (Delta)|Deltaic Lycopolis]] in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], which has led to speculations that he may have been either native [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] Egyptian,<ref>Bilolo, M.: ''La notion de \u00ab l\u2019Un \u00bb dans les Enn\u00e9ades de Plotin et dans les Hymnes th\u00e9bains.

Oxford University Press, 1993, 2003.</ref>\n\nPlotinus had an inherent distrust of materiality (an attitude common to [[Platonism]]), holding to the view that phenomena were a poor image or mimicry ([[mimesis]]) of something \"higher and intelligible\" (VI.I) which was the \"truer part of genuine Being\". This distrust extended to the body, including his own; it is reported by Porphyry that at one point he refused to have his portrait painted, presumably for much the same reasons of dislike. Likewise Plotinus never discussed his ancestry, childhood, or his place or date of birth<ref name=\":0\" />. From all accounts his personal and social life exhibited the highest moral and spiritual standards.\n\nPlotinus took up the study of [[philosophy]] at the age of twenty-seven, around the year 232, and travelled to [[Alexandria]] to study. There he was dissatisfied with every teacher he encountered until an acquaintance suggested he listen to the ideas of [[Ammonius Saccas]]. Upon hearing Ammonius lecture, he declared to his friend, \"this was the man I was looking for,\" and began to study intently under his new instructor. Besides Ammonius, Plotinus was also influenced by the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], and various [[Stoicism|Stoics]].\n\n=== Expedition to Persia and return to Rome ===\nAfter spending the next eleven years in Alexandria, he then decided, at the age of around 38, to investigate the philosophical teachings of the [[Iranian philosophy|Persian philosophers]] and the [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]].<ref>Porphyry, ''On the Life of Plotinus and the Order of His Books'', Ch. 3 (in Armstrong's Loeb translation, \"he became eager to make acquaintance with the Persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the Indians\").</ref> In the pursuit of this endeavor he left Alexandria and joined the army of [[Gordian III]] as it marched on Persia. However, [[Battle of Misiche|the campaign]] was a failure, and on Gordian's eventual death Plotinus found himself abandoned in a hostile land, and only with difficulty found his way back to safety in [[Antioch]].\n\nAt the age of forty, during the reign of [[Philip the Arab]], he came to [[Rome]], where he stayed for most of the remainder of his life.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Beauty and the mystic : Plotinus and Hawkins|last=Leete, Helen, 1938-|isbn=9780987524836|location=Epping, N.S.W|oclc=967937243}}</ref> There he attracted a number of students. His innermost circle included [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Amelius|Amelius Gentilianus]] of [[Tuscany]], the Senator [[Castricius Firmus]], and [[Eustochius of Alexandria]], a doctor who devoted himself to learning from Plotinus and attending to him until his death.  Other students included: [[Zethos the Arab|Zethos]], an [[Arab]] by ancestry who died before Plotinus, leaving him a legacy and some land; [[Disciples of Plotinus|Zoticus]], a critic and poet; [[Paulinus (follower of Plotinus)|Paulinus]], a doctor of [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]]; and [[Serapion (follower of Plotinus)|Serapion]] from Alexandria. He had students amongst the [[Roman Senate]] beside Castricius, such as [[Marcellus Orontius]], [[Sabinillus]], and [[Rogantianus]]. Women were also numbered amongst his students, including Gemina, in whose house he lived during his residence in Rome, and her daughter, also Gemina; and Amphiclea, the wife of Ariston the son of [[Iamblichus]].<ref>Porphyry, ''Vita Plotini'', 9. See also Emma C. Clarke, [[John M. Dillon]], and Jackson P. Hershbell (1999), ''Iamblichus on The Mysteries'', page xix. SBL. who say that \"to gain some credible chronology, one assumes that Ariston married Amphicleia some time after Plotinus's death\"</ref> Finally, Plotinus was a correspondent of the philosopher [[Cassius Dionysius Longinus|Cassius Longinus]].\n\n=== Later life ===\nWhile in Rome Plotinus also gained the respect of the Emperor [[Gallienus]] and his wife [[Cornelia Salonina|Salonina]]. At one point Plotinus attempted to interest Gallienus in rebuilding an abandoned settlement in [[Campania]], known as the 'City of Philosophers', where the inhabitants would live under the constitution set out in [[Plato]]'s ''Laws''. An Imperial subsidy was never granted, for reasons unknown to Porphyry, who reports the incident.\n\nPorphyry subsequently went to live in [[Sicily]], where word reached him that his former teacher had died. The philosopher spent his final days in seclusion on an estate in [[Campania]] which his friend Zethos had bequeathed him. According to the account of Eustochius, who attended him at the end, Plotinus' final words were: \"Try to raise the divine in yourselves to the divine in the all.\"<ref>Mark Edwards, ''Neoplatonic Saints: The Lives of Plotinus and Proclus by Their Students'', Liverpool University Press, 2000, p. 4 n. 20.</ref> Eustochius records that a snake crept under the bed where Plotinus lay, and slipped away through a hole in the wall; at the same moment the philosopher died.\n\nPlotinus wrote the essays that became the ''[[Enneads]]'' (from Greek ''\u1f10\u03bd\u03bd\u03ad\u03b1'' (enn\u00e9a), or group of nine) over a period of several years from ''[[Circa|ca.]]'' 253 until a few months before his death seventeen years later. Porphyry makes note that the ''Enneads'', before being compiled and arranged by himself, were merely the enormous collection of notes and essays which Plotinus used in his lectures and debates, rather than a formal book. Plotinus was unable to revise his own work due to his poor eyesight, yet his writings required extensive editing, according to Porphyry: his master's handwriting was atrocious, he did not properly separate his words, and he cared little for niceties of spelling. Plotinus intensely disliked the editorial process, and turned the task to Porphyry, who not only polished them but put them into the arrangement we now have.\n\n== Major ideas ==\n\n=== One ===\n{{See also|Substance theory}}\nPlotinus taught that there is a supreme, totally transcendent \"[[Henology|One]]\", containing no division, multiplicity, or distinction; beyond all categories of [[being]] and non-being. His \"One\" \"cannot be any existing thing\", nor is it merely the sum of all things (compare the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] doctrine of disbelief in non-material existence), but \"is prior to all existents\". Plotinus identified his \"One\" with the concept of 'Good' and the principle of 'Beauty'. (I.6.9)\n\nHis \"One\" concept encompassed thinker and object. Even the self-contemplating intelligence (the [[noesis]] of the [[nous]]) must contain [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]]. \"Once you have uttered 'The Good,' add no further thought: by any addition, and in proportion to that addition, you introduce a deficiency.\" (III.8.11) Plotinus denies [[sentience]], self-awareness or any other action (''ergon'') to the One (\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f1d\u03bd, ''to En''; V.6.6). Rather, if we insist on describing it further, we must call the One a sheer potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') without which nothing could exist. (III.8.10) As Plotinus explains in both places and elsewhere (e.g. V.6.3), it is impossible for the One to be Being or a self-aware Creator God. At (V.6.4), Plotinus compared the One to \"light\", the Divine Intellect/[[Nous]] (\u039d\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, ''Nous''; first will towards Good) to the \"Sun\", and lastly the Soul (\u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae, ''[[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]]'') to the \"Moon\" whose light is merely a \"derivative conglomeration of light from the 'Sun'\". The first light could exist without any celestial body.\n\nThe One, being beyond all attributes including being and non-being, is the source of the world\u2014but not through any act of creation, willful or otherwise, since activity cannot be ascribed to the unchangeable, immutable One. Plotinus argues instead that the multiple cannot exist without the simple. The \"less perfect\" must, of necessity, \"emanate\", or issue forth, from the \"perfect\" or \"more perfect\". Thus, all of \"creation\" emanates from the One in succeeding stages of lesser and lesser perfection. These stages are not temporally isolated, but occur throughout time as a constant process.\n\nThe One is not just an intellectual concept but something that can be experienced, an experience where one goes beyond all multiplicity.<ref>Stace, W. T. (1960) ''The Teachings of the Mystics'', New York, Signet, pp. 110\u2013123</ref> Plotinus writes, \"We ought not even to say that he will ''see'', but he will ''be'' that which he sees, if indeed it is possible any longer to distinguish between seer and seen, and not boldly to affirm that the two are one.\"<ref>Stace, W. T. (1960) ''The Teachings of the Mystics'', New York, Signet, p. 122</ref>\n\n=== Emanation by the One ===\nSuperficially considered, Plotinus seems to offer an alternative to the orthodox [[Christianity|Christian]] notion of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (out of nothing), although Plotinus never mentions Christianity in any of his works. The metaphysics of emanation (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03ae ''aporrhoe'' (\u0399\u0399.3.2) or \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 ''aporrhoia'' (II.3.11)), however, just like the metaphysics of Creation, confirms the absolute transcendence of the One or of the Divine, as the source of the Being of all things that yet remains transcendent of them in its own nature; the One is in no way affected or diminished by these emanations, just as the Christian God in no way is affected by some sort of exterior \"nothingness\". Plotinus, using a venerable analogy that would become crucial for the (largely Neoplatonic) metaphysics of developed Christian thought, likens the One to the [[Sun]] which emanates light indiscriminately without thereby diminishing itself, or reflection in a mirror which in no way diminishes or otherwise alters the object being reflected.<ref>[https://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/ Plotinus (204\u2014270 C.E.)]</ref>\n\nThe first emanation is ''[[Nous]]'' (Divine Mind, ''[[Logos]]'', Order, Thought, Reason), identified metaphorically with the [[Demiurge]] in Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''. It is the first [[will (philosophy)|Will]] toward Good. From ''Nous'' proceeds the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|World Soul]], which Plotinus subdivides into upper and lower, identifying the lower aspect of Soul with [[nature]]. From the world soul proceeds individual [[human]] souls, and finally, matter, at the lowest level of [[chain of being|being]] and thus the least [[perfection|perfected]] level of the cosmos. Plotinus asserted the ultimately divine nature of material creation since it ultimately derives from the One, through the mediums of ''Nous'' and the world soul. It is by the Good or through beauty that we recognize the One, in material things and then in the [[substantial form|Forms]]. (I.6.6 and I.6.9)\n\nThe essentially devotional nature of Plotinus' philosophy may be further illustrated by his concept of attaining ecstatic union with the One (''[[henosis]]''). Porphyry relates that Plotinus attained such a union four times during the years he knew him. This may be related to [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], liberation, and other concepts of [[mysticism|mystical union]] common to many Eastern and Western traditions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lander|first=Janis|title=Spiritual Art and Art Education|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page= 76|isbn=9781134667895}}</ref>\n\n=== The true human and happiness ===\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The philosophy of Plotinus has always exerted a peculiar fascination upon those whose discontent with things as they are has led them to seek the realities behind what they took to be merely the appearances of the sense.\n |source = ''The philosophy of Plotinus: representative books from the Enneads'', p. vii<ref name=\"Plotinus1950\">{{cite book|author=Plotinus|title=The philosophy of Plotinus: representative books from the Enneads|url=https://archive.org/details/philosophyofplot032843mbp|accessdate=1 February 2012|year=1950|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|page=vii}}</ref>\n |width  = 30%\n |align  = right\n}}\nAuthentic human happiness for Plotinus consists of the true human identifying with that which is the best in the universe. Because happiness is beyond anything physical, Plotinus stresses the point that worldly fortune does not control true human happiness, and thus \u201c\u2026 there exists no single human being that does not either potentially or effectively possess this thing we hold to constitute happiness.\u201d (Enneads I.4.4) The issue of happiness is one of Plotinus\u2019 greatest imprints on Western thought, as he is one of the first to introduce the idea that [[eudaimonia]] (happiness) is attainable only within consciousness.\n\nThe true human is an incorporeal contemplative capacity of the soul, and superior to all things corporeal. It then follows that real human happiness is independent of the physical world. Real happiness is, instead, dependent on the metaphysical and authentic human being found in this highest capacity of Reason. \u201cFor man, and especially the Proficient, is not the Couplement of Soul and body: the proof is that man can be disengaged from the body and disdain its nominal goods.\u201d (Enneads I.4.14) The human who has achieved happiness will not be bothered by sickness, discomfort, etc., as his focus is on the greatest things. Authentic human happiness is the utilization of the most authentically human capacity of contemplation. Even in daily, physical action, the flourishing human\u2019s \u201c\u2026 Act is determined by the higher phase of the Soul.\u201d (Enneads III.4.6) Even in the most dramatic arguments Plotinus considers (if the Proficient is subject to extreme physical torture, for example), he concludes this only strengthens his claim of true happiness being metaphysical, as the truly happy human being would understand that which is being tortured is merely a body, not the conscious self, and happiness could persist.\n\nPlotinus offers a comprehensive description of his conception of a person who has achieved [[eudaimonia]]. \u201cThe perfect life\u201d involves a man who commands reason and contemplation. (Enneads I.4.4) A happy person will not sway between happy and sad, as many of Plotinus' contemporaries believed. Stoics, for example, question the ability of someone to be happy (presupposing happiness is contemplation) if they are mentally incapacitated or even asleep. Plotinus disregards this claim, as the soul and true human do not sleep or even exist in time, nor will a living human who has achieved eudaimonia suddenly stop using its greatest, most authentic capacity just because of the body\u2019s discomfort in the physical realm. \u201c\u2026 The Proficient\u2019s will is set always and only inward.\u201d (Enneads I.4.11)\n\nOverall, happiness for Plotinus is \"... a flight from this world's ways and things.\" (Theaet. 176) and a focus on the highest, i.e. Forms and the One.\n\n===Henosis===\n{{main|Henosis}}\n\nHenosis is the word for mystical \"oneness\", \"union\", or \"unity\" in classical Greek. In [[Platonism]], and especially [[Neoplatonism]], the goal of henosis is union with what is fundamental in reality: the One ([[wikt:\u03b5\u1f37\u03c2|\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f1d\u03bd]]), the Source, or [[Monism|Monad]].<ref>Stamatellos, Giannis. ''Plotinus and the Presocratics: A Philosophical Study of Presocratic Influences in Plotinus' Enneads''. SUNY Series in Ancient Greek Philosophy. SUNY Press, 2007, p. 37 {{ISBN|0791470628}}</ref>\n\nAs is specified in the writings of Plotinus on [[henology]], one can reach a state of [[tabula rasa]], a blank state where the individual may grasp or merge with The One.{{refn|group=note|Plotinus: <br>* \"Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul. To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One. (6.9.7)<br>* \"If he remembers who he became when he merged with the One, he will bear its image in himself. He was himself one, with no diversity in himself or his outward relations; for no movement was in him, no passion, no desire for another, once the ascent was accomplished. Nor indeed was there any reason or though, nor, if we dare say it, any trace of himself.\" (6.9.11)}} This absolute simplicity means that the nous or the person is then dissolved, completely absorbed back into the Monad. Here within the ''Enneads'' of Plotinus the Monad can be referred to as the Good above the demiurge.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">''[[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]]'' by Richard T.

All division is reconciled in the one; the final stage before reaching singularity, called duality (dyad), is completely reconciled in the Monad, Source or One (see [[monism]]). As the one source or substance of all things, the Monad is all encompassing. As infinite and indeterminate all is reconciled in the dunamis or one. It is the demiurge or second emanation that is the nous in Plotinus. It is the demiurge (creator, action, energy) or nous that \"perceives\" and therefore causes the force (potential or One) to manifest as energy, or the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]] called the material world. Nous as being; being and perception (intellect) manifest what is called soul ([[Gaia hypothesis|World Soul]]).<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nHenosis for Plotinus was defined in his works as a reversing of the ontological process of consciousness via [[meditation]] (in the Western mind to un[[Contemplation|contemplate]]) toward no thought ([[Nous]] or [[demiurge]]) and no division ([[Dyad (symbol)|dyad]]) within the individual (being). Plotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with [[Aristotle]] but also various World religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels. Plotinus' works have an [[ascetic]] character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as [[immanent]], with matter as essential to its being, having no true or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendential]] character or essence, substance or ousia (\u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1). This approach is called philosophical [[Idealism]].<ref>[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher: \"With Plotinus there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], ''idealism'' that had long been current in the [[East]] even at that time, for it taught ([[Enneads]], iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the [[soul]] has made the [[world]] by stepping from [[eternity]] into [[time]], with the explanation: 'For there is for this [[universe]] no other place than the soul or [[mind]]' (neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere).\" (''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume I, \"Fragments for the History of Philosophy,\" \u00a7 7)</ref>\n\n==Relation with contemporary philosophy and religion==\n\n=== Plotinus's Relation to Plato===\n{{see also|Allegorical interpretations of Plato}}\n\nFor several centuries after the [[Protestant Reformation]], Neo-Platonism was condemned as a decadent and 'oriental' distortion of Platonism. In a famous 1929 essay, [[E. R. Dodds]] showed that key conceptions of Neo-Platonism could be traced from their origin in Plato's dialogues, through his immediate followers (e.g., [[Speusippus]]) and the Neo-Pythagoreans, to Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists. Thus Plotinus' philosophy was, he argued, 'not the starting-point of Neo-Platonism but its intellectual culmination.'<ref>E. R. Dodds, 'The Parmenides of Plato and the Origin of the Neoplatonic One,' ''The Classical Quarterly'', v. 22, No. 3/4, 1928, pp. 129-142, esp. 140.</ref> Further research reinforced this view and by 1954 Merlan could say 'The present tendency is toward bridging rather than widening the gap separating Platonism from Neo-Platonism.'<ref>Philip Merlan, ''From Platonism to Neoplatonism'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1954, 1968), p. 3.</ref>\n\nSince the 1950s, the [[Plato's unwritten doctrines|T\u00fcbingen School]] of Plato interpretation has argued that the so-called 'unwritten doctrines' of Plato debated by Aristotle and the Early Academy strongly resemble Plotinus's metaphysics. In this case, the Neo-Platonic reading of Plato would be, at least in this central area, historically justified. This implies that Neo-Platonism is less of an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato's unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the T\u00fcbingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus's metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to the first generation of Plato's students. This confirms Plotinus' own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato's doctrines.<ref>Detlef Thiel: ''Die Philosophie des Xenokrates im Kontext der Alten Akademie'', M\u00fcnchen 2006, pp. 197ff. and note 64; Jens Halfwassen: ''Der Aufstieg zum Einen. ''</ref>\n\n=== Plotinus and the Gnostics ===\n{{See also|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism}}\n\nAt least two modern conferences within Hellenic philosophy fields of study have been held in order to address what Plotinus stated in his tract ''Against the Gnostics'' and to whom he was addressing it, in order to separate and clarify the events and persons involved in the origin of the term \"Gnostic\". From the dialogue, it appears that the word had an origin in the Platonic and Hellenistic tradition long before the group calling themselves \"Gnostics\"\u2014or the group covered under the modern term \"Gnosticism\"\u2014ever appeared. It would seem that this shift from Platonic to Gnostic usage has led many people to confusion. The strategy of sectarians taking [[Greek language|Greek]] terms from philosophical contexts and re-applying them to religious contexts was popular in [[Christianity]], the [[Cult of Isis]] and other ancient religious contexts including [[Hermetica|Hermetic]] ones (see [[Alexander of Abonutichus]] for an example).\n\nAccording to A. H. Armstrong, Plotinus and the [[neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] viewed Gnosticism{{clarification needed|date=October 2019}} as a form of heresy or [[sectarian]]ism to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophy of the Mediterranean and Middle East.{{refn|group=note|From Introduction to Against the Gnostics in Plotinus' Enneads as translated by A. H. Armstrong, pp. 220\u2013222:<br />The treatise as it stands in the ''[[Enneads]]'' is a most powerful protest on behalf of [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] philosophy against the un-Hellenic [[heresy]] (as it was from the Platonist as well as the orthodox Christian point of view) of Gnosticism. There were Gnostics among Plotinus's own friends, whom he had not succeeded in converting (Enneads ch.10 of this treatise) and he and his pupils devoted considerable time and energy to anti-Gnostic controversy (Life of Plotinus ch.16). He obviously considered Gnosticism an extremely dangerous influence, likely to pervert the minds even of members of his own circle. It is impossible to attempt to give an account of Gnosticism here. By far the best discussion of what the particular group of Gnostics Plotinus knew believed is M. Puech's admirable contribution to Entretiens Hardt V (Les Sourcesde Plotin). But it is important for the understanding of this treatise to be clear about the reasons why Plotinus disliked them so intensely and thought their influence so harmful.}} Also according to Armstrong, Plotinus accused them of using senseless jargon and being overly dramatic and insolent in their distortion of Plato's ontology.\"{{refn|group=note|From Introduction to Against the Gnostics in Plotinus' Enneads as translated by A.

Worst of all, they despise and hate the material universe and deny its goodness and the goodness of its maker. This for a Platonist is utter blasphemy, and all the worse because it obviously derives to some extent from the sharply other-worldly side of Plato's own teaching (e.g. in the ''[[Phaedo]]''). At this point in his attack Plotinus comes very close in some ways to the orthodox Christian opponents of Gnosticism, who also insist that this world is the good work of God in his goodness. But, here as on the question of salvation, the doctrine which Plotinus is defending is as sharply opposed on other ways to orthodox Christianity as to Gnosticism: for he maintains not only the goodness of the material universe but also its eternity and its divinity. The idea that the universe could have a beginning and end is inseparably connected in his mind with the idea that the divine action in making it is arbitrary and irrational. And to deny the divinity (though a subordinate and dependent divinity) of the World-Soul, and of those noblest of embodied living beings the heavenly bodies, seems to him both blasphemous and unreasonable. Pages 220\u2013222}}\n\nFor decades, Armstrong's was the only translation available of Plotinus. For this reason, his claims were authoritative. However, a modern translation by Lloyd P. Gerson doesn't necessarily support all of Armstrong's views. Unlike Armstrong, Gerson didn't find Plotinus to be so vitriolic against the Gnostics.<ref name=\"gerson\">{{cite book |title=Plotinus: The Enneads |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107001770 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCw2yAEACAAJ |language=en}}</ref> According to Gerson:\n{{quote|As Plotinus himself tells us, at the time of this treatise\u2019s composition some of his friends were \u2018attached\u2019 to Gnostic doctrine, and he believed that this attachment was harmful. So he sets out here a number of objections and corrections. Some of these are directed at very specific tenets of Gnosticism, e.g. the introduction of a \u2018new earth\u2019 or a principle of \u2018Wisdom\u2019, but the general thrust of this treatise has a much broader scope. The Gnostics are very critical of the sensible universe and its contents, and as a Platonist, Plotinus must share this critical attitude to some extent. But here he makes his case that the proper understanding of the highest principles and emanation forces us to respect the sensible world as the best possible imitation of the intelligible world.}}\n\nPlotinus seems to direct his attacks at a very specific sect of Gnostics, most notably a sect of Christian Gnostics that held anti-polytheistic and anti-daemon views, and that preached salvation was possible without struggle.<ref name=\"gerson\" /> At one point, Plotinus makes clear that his major grudge is the way Gnostics 'misused' Plato's teachings, and not their own teachings themselves:\n{{quote|There are no hard feelings if they tell us in which respects they intend to disagree with Plato [...] Rather, whatever strikes them as their own distinct views in comparison with the Greeks\u2019, these views \u2013 as well as the views that contradict them \u2013 should be forthrightly set out on their own in a considerate and philosophical manner.}}\n\nThe Neoplatonic movement (though Plotinus would have simply referred to himself as a philosopher of Plato) seems to be motivated by the desire of Plotinus to revive the pagan philosophical tradition.{{refn|group=note|\"... as Plotinus had endeavored to revive the religious spirit of paganism\".<ref>''A Biographical History of Philosophy'', by George Henry Lewes Published 1892, G. Routledge & Sons, LTD, p. 294</ref>}} Plotinus was not claiming to innovate with the ''Enneads'', but to clarify aspects of the works of Plato that he considered misrepresented or misunderstood.<ref name=\"Stanford1\" /> Plotinus does not claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a tradition.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-dionysius-areopagite/ Pseudo-Dionysius] in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> Plotinus referred to tradition as a way to interpret Plato's intentions. Because the teachings of Plato were for members of the academy rather than the general public, it was easy for outsiders to misunderstand Plato's meaning. However, Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as [[misotheism]] or [[Eutheism and dystheism|dystheism]] of the creator God as an answer to the [[problem of evil]]) as the targets of his criticism.\n\n=== Against causal astrology ===\nPlotinus seems to be one of the first to argue against the still popular notion of causal [[astrology]]. In the late tractate 2.3, \"Are the stars causes?\", Plotinus makes the argument that specific stars influencing one's fortune (a common [[Hellenistic]] theme) attributes [[irrationality]] to a perfect universe, and invites moral depravity. He does, however, claim the stars and planets are [[Soul (spirit)|ensouled]], as witnessed by their [[Apparent retrograde motion|movement]].\n\n== Influence ==\n\n=== Ancient world ===\nThe emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] was deeply influenced by Neoplatonism,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religious Competition in the Greco-Roman World|last=Dingeldein|first=Laura B.|publisher=SBL Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0884141587|editor-last=DesRosiers|editor-first=Nathaniel P.|location=Atlanta|pages=119\u2013129|chapter=Julian's Philosophy and His Religious Program|editor-last2=Vuong|editor-first2=Lily C.}}</ref> as was [[Hypatia|Hypatia of Alexandria]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hypatia|title=Hypatia|last=[[Michael A.

In ''A History of Western Philosophy'', philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that:\n{{quote|To the Christian, the Other World was the Kingdom of Heaven, to be enjoyed after death; to the Platonist, it was the eternal world of ideas, the real world as opposed to that of illusory appearance. Christian theologians combined these points of view, and embodied much of the philosophy of Plotinus. [...] Plotinus, accordingly, is historically important as an influence in moulding the Christianity of the Middle Ages and of theology.<ref>\"A History of Western Philosophy.\" Bertrand Russell. Simon and Schuster, INC. 1945. pp. 284\u2013285</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox]] position on ''energy,'' for example, is often contrasted with the position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and in part this is attributed to varying interpretations of [[Aristotle]] and Plotinus, either through [[Thomas Aquinas]] for the Roman Catholics or [[Gregory Palamas]] for the Orthodox Christians.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Islam ===\nNeoplatonism and the ideas of Plotinus influenced medieval Islam as well, since the [[Sunni]] [[Abbasid]]s fused Greek concepts into sponsored state texts, and found great influence amongst the [[Ismaili]] [[Shia]]<ref name=\"halm 176\">Heinz Halm, ''Shi'ism'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 176.</ref> and Persian philosophers as well, such as Muhammad al-Nasafi and [[Abu Yaqub Sijistani]]. By the 11th century, Neoplatonism was adopted by the [[Fatimid]] state of Egypt, and taught by their [[da'i (Islam)|da'i]].<ref name=\"halm 176\"/> Neoplatonism was brought to the Fatimid court by [[Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani]], although his teachings differed from Nasafi and Sijistani, who were more aligned with the original teachings of Plotinus.<ref name=\"halm 177\">Heinz Halm, ''Shi'ism'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 177.</ref> The teachings of Kirmani in turn influenced philosophers such as [[Nasir Khusraw]] of Persia.<ref name=\"halm 177\"/>\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs with Islam and Christianity, Neoplatonism in general and Plotinus in particular influenced speculative thought. Notable thinkers expressing Neoplatonist themes are [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] (Latin: Avicebron) and Moses ben Maimon (Latin: [[Maimonides]]). As with Islam and Christianity, apophatic theology and the privative nature of evil are two prominent themes that such thinkers picked up from either Plotinus or his successors.\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn the [[Renaissance]] the philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] set up an Academy under the patronage of [[Cosimo de Medici]] in [[Florence]], mirroring that of Plato. His work was of great importance in reconciling the philosophy of Plato directly with Christianity. One of his most distinguished pupils was [[Pico della Mirandola]], author of ''An Oration On the Dignity of Man''.\n\n=== England ===\nIn England, Plotinus was the cardinal influence on the 17th-century school of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], and on numerous writers from [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] to [[William Butler Yeats|W.
