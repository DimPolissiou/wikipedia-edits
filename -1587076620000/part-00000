This declassification enabled the discovery that before and during the early years of [[World War II]], the [[Nazi Germany|German government]] sold a special kind of [[Reichsmark]], known as R\u00fcckwanderer [returnee] Marks, to American citizens of German descent. Chase National Bank, along with other businesses, were involved in these transactions. Through Chase, this allowed Nazi sympathizers to purchase Marks with [[American dollar|dollars]] at a discounted rate. Specifically, \"The financial houses understood that the German government paid the commissions (to its agents, including Chase) through the sale of discounted, blocked Marks that came mainly from [[Jews]] who had fled [[Germany]].\" In other words, Nazi Germany was able to offer these Marks below face-value because they had been stolen from [[emigr\u00e9]]s fleeing the Nazi regime. Between 1936 and 1941, the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] amassed over $20 million, and the businesses enabling these transactions earned $1.2 million in commissions. Of these commissions, over $500,000 went to Chase National Bank and its subagents.\n\nThese facts were discovered when the FBI began its investigation in October 1940. The purpose of the investigation was to follow German-Americans who had bought the Marks. However, Chase National Bank's executives were never federally prosecuted because Chase's lead attorney threatened to reveal [[FBI]], [[United States Army|Army]], and [[United States Navy|Navy]] \"sources and methods\" in court (needs reference). Publicly naming the sources and methods could have posed security risks and threatened future [[intelligence gathering]].

From the late 1930s until June 14, 1941, when President [[Franklin D.

The order blocking any access to French accounts in the U.S. by anyone, but especially by the Nazis was issued by [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]], with the approval of FDR. Within hours of the order, Chase unblocked the accounts and the funds were transferred through [[South America]] to Nazi Germany.<ref name=hydra />\n\n===Refusal to release funds belonging to Jews in Occupied France===\n[[US Treasury]] officials wanted an investigation of French subsidiaries of American banks, such as Chase Bank, [[J.P. Morgan & Co]], [[National City Corporation]], [[Guaranty Trust Company of New York|Guaranty Bank]], [[Bankers Trust]], and [[American Express]]. Of these banks, only Chase and Morgan remained open in France during the [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|Nazi occupation]]. The Chase branch chief in Paris, France, Carlos Niedermann, told his supervisor in New York that there had been an \"expansion of deposits\". Also, Niedermann was, \"very vigorous in enforcing restrictions against Jewish property, even going so far as to refuse to release funds belonging to Jews in anticipation that a decree with [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]] provisions prohibiting such release might be published in the near future by the occupying Nazi authorities\".\n\nIn 1998, Chase general counsel William McDavid said that Chase did not have control over Niedermann. Whether that claim was true or not, Chase Manhattan Bank acknowledged seizing about 100 accounts during the [[Vichy government|Vichy regime]]. Kenneth McCallion, a partner in the New York firm Goodkind Labaton Rudoff & Sucharow,<ref>Beckett, P., [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB914454880838898000 \"Chase Manhattan, J.P. Morgan Are Named in Suit on Holocaust\"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', December 24, 1998.</ref> led a lawsuit against [[Barclays Bank]] for the illegal seizure of assets during WWII and has since turned his attention toward Chase. The [[World Jewish Congress]] (WJC), entered into discussions with Chase and a spokesperson for the WJC said, \"Nobody at Chase today is guilty. They were not involved in whatever happened, but they do accept that they have an institutional responsibility.\" A Chase spokesman said, \"This is a moral issue that we take very seriously.\" Chase general counsel McDavid added, \"that Chase intends to compensate Jewish account holders whose assets were illegally plundered\". In 1999, the French government formed a commission to report findings to [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Lionel Jospin]]. Claire Andrieu, a commission member and history professor at the [[Sorbonne]], said that under the Vichy regime, French banks received visits from Nazi officials but U.S. banks did not. At that time, they did not have to report Jewish accounts, but they did just as the French banks did.

This declassification enabled the discovery that before and during the early years of [[World War II]], the [[Nazi Germany|German government]] sold a special kind of [[Reichsmark]], known as R\u00fcckwanderer [returnee] Marks, to American citizens of German descent. Chase National Bank, along with other businesses, were involved in these transactions. Through Chase, this allowed Nazi sympathizers to purchase Marks with [[American dollar|dollars]] at a discounted rate. Specifically, \"The financial houses understood that the German government paid the commissions (to its agents, including Chase) through the sale of discounted, blocked Marks that came mainly from [[Jews]] who had fled [[Germany]].\" In other words, Nazi Germany was able to offer these Marks below face-value because they had been stolen from [[emigr\u00e9]]s fleeing the Nazi regime. Between 1936 and 1941, the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] amassed over $20 million, and the businesses enabling these transactions earned $1.2 million in commissions. Of these commissions, over $500,000 went to Chase National Bank and its subagents.\n\nThese facts were discovered when the FBI began its investigation in October 1940. The purpose of the investigation was to follow German-Americans who had bought the Marks. However, Chase National Bank's executives were never federally prosecuted because Chase's lead attorney threatened to reveal [[FBI]], [[United States Army|Army]], and [[United States Navy|Navy]] \"sources and methods\" in court (needs reference). Publicly naming the sources and methods could have posed security risks and threatened future [[intelligence gathering]].

From the late 1930s until June 14, 1941, when President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (FDR) issued an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] freezing German assets, Chase National Bank worked with the Nazi government. The order blocking any access to French accounts in the U.S. by anyone, but especially by the Nazis was issued by [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]], with the approval of FDR. Within hours of the order, Chase unblocked the accounts and the funds were transferred through [[South America]] to Nazi Germany.<ref name=hydra />\n\n===Refusal to release funds belonging to Jews in Occupied France===\n[[US Treasury]] officials wanted an investigation of French subsidiaries of American banks, such as Chase Bank, [[J.P. Morgan & Co]], [[National City Corporation]], [[Guaranty Trust Company of New York|Guaranty Bank]], [[Bankers Trust]], and [[American Express]]. Of these banks, only Chase and Morgan remained open in France during the [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|Nazi occupation]]. The Chase branch chief in Paris, France, Carlos Niedermann, told his supervisor in New York that there had been an \"expansion of deposits\". Also, Niedermann was, \"very vigorous in enforcing restrictions against Jewish property, even going so far as to refuse to release funds belonging to Jews in anticipation that a decree with [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]] provisions prohibiting such release might be published in the near future by the occupying Nazi authorities\".\n\nIn 1998, Chase general counsel William McDavid said that Chase did not have control over Niedermann. Whether that claim was true or not, Chase Manhattan Bank acknowledged seizing about 100 accounts during the [[Vichy government|Vichy regime]]. Kenneth McCallion, a partner in the New York firm Goodkind Labaton Rudoff & Sucharow,<ref>Beckett, P., [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB914454880838898000 \"Chase Manhattan, J.P. Morgan Are Named in Suit on Holocaust\"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', December 24, 1998.</ref> led a lawsuit against [[Barclays Bank]] for the illegal seizure of assets during WWII and has since turned his attention toward Chase. The [[World Jewish Congress]] (WJC), entered into discussions with Chase and a spokesperson for the WJC said, \"Nobody at Chase today is guilty. They were not involved in whatever happened, but they do accept that they have an institutional responsibility.\" A Chase spokesman said, \"This is a moral issue that we take very seriously.\" Chase general counsel McDavid added, \"that Chase intends to compensate Jewish account holders whose assets were illegally plundered\". In 1999, the French government formed a commission to report findings to [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Lionel Jospin]]. Claire Andrieu, a commission member and history professor at the [[Sorbonne]], said that under the Vichy regime, French banks received visits from Nazi officials but U.S. banks did not. At that time, they did not have to report Jewish accounts, but they did just as the French banks did.

It consists of nine [[canto]]s and is exceptional in Bengali literature both in terms of style and content. He also wrote poems about the sorrows and afflictions of love as spoken by women.\n\nDutta is widely considered to be one of the greatest poets in [[Bengali literature]] and the father of the Bengali [[sonnet]]. He pioneered what came to be called 'Amitrakshar chhanda' ([[blank verse]]). Although his first love remained poetry, Dutt showed prodigious skill as a playwright. He was the first to write Bengali plays in the English style, segregating the play into acts and scenes. He was also the pioneer of the first satirical plays in Bengali \u2013 ''Buro Shaliker Ghare Rnow'' (Bengali - \u09ac\u09c1\u09a1\u09bc\u09cb \u09b6\u09be\u09b2\u09bf\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u0998\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09c7 \u09b0\u09cb\u0981) and ''Ekei Ki B\u00f4le S\u00e4bhy\u00f4ta?''

Here Satan's beauty is stressed but obviously it is a faded beauty<br />\"King Poru\" is one of the well known poems based on a legendary  episode from  Indian history. The King Poru was caught by the military of King Alexander after winning the battle of the Hydaspes River. Alexander asked Porus how he wanted ueto be treated. To thisthe  King  Porus answered that he wanted to be treated like a King.\n\nKing Porus A Legend Of Old is  based upon the true incident from history of India.There are 6 stanzas in this long na rrative poem . The first stanza begins with the image of raging storm., The poem ends with the images of volcano and earthquake.These images suggest that it is a wide scale tragedy.It brings forth issues that form a kind of moral to the tale.\nThe Queen  of Delhi's Dream is a tragic  poem by Michael Madhusudan Dutt. It  has been taken from ''The Captive Ladie'' (1849). It tells the story of the Rajput King [[Prithviraj Chauhan]]. In this  poem, the poet presents the  story of King's  abduction of the daughter of the  King of Kanauj and his unsuccessful battle with the  Muslim  invader [[Muhammad  Ghori]]. The poem ends with the  death of the King and his Queen.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHe was born in Sagordari, a village in [[Keshabpur Upazila]], [[Jessore District]] of [[Bengal|Undivided Bengal]] (now [[Bangladesh]]). His father was Rajnarayan Dutt, a pleader in the [[Sadr Diwani Adalat|Sadar court]],<ref name=\":4\" /> and his mother was Jahnabi Devi. He was an exceptionally talented student. Since his childhood, Dutt was recognised by his teachers and professors as being a precocious child with a gift of literary expression. He was very imaginative. Early exposure to English education and European literature at home and in [[Kolkata]] inspired him to emulate the English in taste, manners and intellect. An early influence was his teacher at [[Hindu College, Calcutta]], [[David Lester Richardson]]. Richardson was a poet and inspired in Dutt a love of English poetry, particularly [[Lord Byron|Byron]].\n\nDutt began writing English poetry aged around 17 years, sending his works to publications in England, including ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' and ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]''. They were, however, never published.<ref name=\":12\"/> It was also the time he began correspondence with his friend, [[Gour Das Bysack]], which today form the bulk of the source on his life.\n\nAs a young student, Dutt was influenced by the thoughts and actions of the [[Young Bengal]] - a movement by a group of illustrious former students of the Hindu College (now [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]]) in [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata) against the atrocities, blind beliefs and customs they held as illogical, prevalent in the Hindu society of 19th century Bengal. Dutta, a student of Hindu College himself, aspired to be an English poet and longed to travel to England to gain fame. When his father, concerned by these trends, arranged his marriage, he rebelled. One aspect of his rebellion involved conversion to Christianity.\n\n===In his own words===\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n\"Where man in all his truest glory lives,\nAnd nature's face is exquisitely sweet;\nFor those fair climes I heave impatient sigh,\nThere let me live and there let me die\".<ref name=\"Chakrabarty2001\">{{cite book|author=Dipesh Chakrabarty|title=Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference (New Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqDa4tGENvYC&pg=PA33|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=15 February 2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13001-9|pages=33\u2013}}</ref>\n</poem>\n\nMadhusudan embraced Christianity<ref name=bpedia>{{cite book |last=Bhowmik |first=Dulal |year=2012 |chapter=Dutt, Michael Madhusudan |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Dutt,_Michael_Madhusudan |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> at the Old Mission Church in spite of the objections of his parents and relatives on 9 February 1843.

The Captive Ladie was published in 1849 and like Derozio's The Fakeer of Jungheera this is a long narrative poem in which it is difficult to sustain one's interest. In The Anglo- Saxon and the Hindu(1854), an essay in florid, even purple, prose which has references to and quotations from almost the whole of Macaulay's shelf of European books. He was greatly influenced by the works of [[William Wordsworth]] and [[John Milton]]. Dutt was a spirited [[bohemian]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]].\nIn the fakeer of Jungheera the priest glorifies the custom of Sati and praise the widow who is going to burn herself with her dead husband.However,if we consider the chorus in the context of the complete narrative this as well as the chorus is steeply.\n\nDuring his stay in Madras, he published such works as ''King Porus'', ''The Captive Ladie'' (1849) - centered around [[Prithviraj Chauhan|King Prithviraj]]'s elopement with the princess of [[Kannauj|Kannuaj]]- and ''Visions of the Past.'' The Hurkaru, a prominent periodical at the time gave the self-published ''The Captive Ladie'' unfavourable reviews, and was in Madhusudan's own words, \"''was somewhat severe''\". [[John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune]], the then President of the Council of Education, was full of praise for the octosyllabic in his letter to [[Gour Das Bysack|Bysack]], and advised Dutt to \"employ the taste and talents, which he has cultivated by the study of English, in improving the standard, and adding to the stock of the poetry of his own language.\"\n\nUnder the [[pseudonym]], Timothy Penpoem, he published his poems in the periodicals he edited.\n\n=== Calcutta Years (1858-1862)<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> ===\nThe period during which he worked as a head clerk and later as the Chief Interpreter in the court, marked his transition to writing in his native Bengali, following the advice of [[John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune|Bethune]] and [[Gour Das Bysack|Bysack]]. He wrote 5 plays:  ''Sermista'' (1859)'', Padmavati'' (1859)'', Ekei Ki Boley Sabyata'' (1860), ''Krishna Kumari'' (1860) ''and Buro Shaliker Ghare Ron'' (1860). Then followed the narrative poems: ''Tilottama Sambhava Kavya'' (1861), ''Meghnad Badh Kavya'' (1861), ''Brajagana Kavya'' (1861) and ''Veerangana Kavya'' (1861). He also translated three plays from Bangla to English, including his own ''Sermista.''\n\n''[[Meghnad Badh Kavya]], The Slaying of Meghnad,'' the story of the final fight and demise of [[Meghnad Indrajit|Meghnad]], the eldest son of [[Ravana]], is unanimously hailed as his magnum opus, although his journey to publication and recognition was far from smooth. However, with its publication, he distinguished himself as a serious composer of an entirely new genre of heroic poetry, that was [[Homeric]] and [[Dante]]sque in technique and style, and yet so fundamentally native in theme. To cite the poet himself: \"''I awoke one morning and found myself famous''.\"  Nevertheless, it took a few years for this epic to win recognition all over the country.\n\n=== Final years (1866-1873)<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> ===\nA volume of his Bangla sonnets was published in 1866. His final play, ''Maya Kannan'', was written in 1872.

He composed a poem in honour of the poet, translated it into French and Italian, and sent it to the king of Italy.

It consists of nine [[canto]]s and is exceptional in Bengali literature both in terms of style and content. He also wrote poems about the sorrows and afflictions of love as spoken by women.\n\nDutta is widely considered to be one of the greatest poets in [[Bengali literature]] and the father of the Bengali [[sonnet]]. He pioneered what came to be called 'Amitrakshar chhanda' ([[blank verse]]). Although his first love remained poetry, Dutt showed prodigious skill as a playwright. He was the first to write Bengali plays in the English style, segregating the play into acts and scenes. He was also the pioneer of the first satirical plays in Bengali \u2013 ''Buro Shaliker Ghare Rnow'' (Bengali - \u09ac\u09c1\u09a1\u09bc\u09cb \u09b6\u09be\u09b2\u09bf\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u0998\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09c7 \u09b0\u09cb\u0981) and ''Ekei Ki B\u00f4le S\u00e4bhy\u00f4ta?''

Here Satan's beauty is stressed but obviously it is a faded beauty<br />\"King Poru\" is one of the well known poems based on a legendary  episode from  Indian history. The King Poru was caught by the military of King Alexander after winning the battle of the Hydaspes River. Alexander asked Porus how he wanted ueto be treated. To thisthe  King  Porus answered that he wanted to be treated like a King.\n\nKing Porus A Legend Of Old is  based upon the true incident from history of India.There are 6 stanzas in this long na rrative poem . The first stanza begins with the image of raging storm., The poem ends with the images of volcano and earthquake.These images suggest that it is a wide scale tragedy.It brings forth issues that form a kind of moral to the tale.\nThe Queen  of Delhi's Dream is a tragic  poem by Michael Madhusudan Dutt. It  has been taken from ''The Captive Ladie'' (1849). It tells the story of the Rajput King [[Prithviraj Chauhan]]. In this  poem, the poet presents the  story of King's  abduction of the daughter of the  King of Kanauj and his unsuccessful battle with the  Muslim  invader [[Muhammad  Ghori]]. The poem ends with the  death of the King and his Queen.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHe was born in Sagordari, a village in [[Keshabpur Upazila]], [[Jessore District]] of [[Bengal|Undivided Bengal]] (now [[Bangladesh]]). His father was Rajnarayan Dutt, a pleader in the [[Sadr Diwani Adalat|Sadar court]],<ref name=\":4\" /> and his mother was Jahnabi Devi. He was an exceptionally talented student. Since his childhood, Dutt was recognised by his teachers and professors as being a precocious child with a gift of literary expression. He was very imaginative. Early exposure to English education and European literature at home and in [[Kolkata]] inspired him to emulate the English in taste, manners and intellect. An early influence was his teacher at [[Hindu College, Calcutta]], [[David Lester Richardson]]. Richardson was a poet and inspired in Dutt a love of English poetry, particularly [[Lord Byron|Byron]].\n\nDutt began writing English poetry aged around 17 years, sending his works to publications in England, including ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' and ''[[Bentley's Miscellany]]''. They were, however, never published.<ref name=\":12\"/> It was also the time he began correspondence with his friend, [[Gour Das Bysack]], which today form the bulk of the source on his life.\n\nAs a young student, Dutt was influenced by the thoughts and actions of the [[Young Bengal]] - a movement by a group of illustrious former students of the Hindu College (now [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]]) in [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata) against the atrocities, blind beliefs and customs they held as illogical, prevalent in the Hindu society of 19th century Bengal. Dutta, a student of Hindu College himself, aspired to be an English poet and longed to travel to England to gain fame. When his father, concerned by these trends, arranged his marriage, he rebelled. One aspect of his rebellion involved conversion to Christianity.\n\n===In his own words===\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n\"Where man in all his truest glory lives,\nAnd nature's face is exquisitely sweet;\nFor those fair climes I heave impatient sigh,\nThere let me live and there let me die\".<ref name=\"Chakrabarty2001\">{{cite book|author=Dipesh Chakrabarty|title=Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference (New Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqDa4tGENvYC&pg=PA33|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=15 February 2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-13001-9|pages=33\u2013}}</ref>\n</poem>\n\nMadhusudan embraced Christianity<ref name=bpedia>{{cite book |last=Bhowmik |first=Dulal |year=2012 |chapter=Dutt, Michael Madhusudan |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Dutt,_Michael_Madhusudan |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> at the Old Mission Church in spite of the objections of his parents and relatives on 9 February 1843.

The Captive Ladie was published in 1849 and like Derozio's The Fakeer of Jungheera this is a long narrative poem in which it is difficult to sustain one's interest. In The Anglo- Saxon and the Hindu(1854), an essay in florid, even purple, prose which has references to and quotations from almost the whole of Macaulay's shelf of European books. He was greatly influenced by the works of [[William Wordsworth]] and [[John Milton]]. Dutt was a spirited [[bohemian]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]].\nIn the fakeer of Jungheera the priest glorifies the custom of Sati and praise the widow who is going to burn herself with her dead husband.However,if we consider the chorus in the context of the complete narrative this as well as the chorus is steeply.\n\nDuring his stay in Madras, he published such works as ''King Porus'', ''The Captive Ladie'' (1849) - centered around [[Prithviraj Chauhan|King Prithviraj]]'s elopement with the princess of [[Kannauj|Kannuaj]]- and ''Visions of the Past.'' The Hurkaru, a prominent periodical at the time gave the self-published ''The Captive Ladie'' unfavourable reviews, and was in Madhusudan's own words, \"''was somewhat severe''\". [[John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune]], the then President of the Council of Education, was full of praise for the octosyllabic in his letter to [[Gour Das Bysack|Bysack]], and advised Dutt to \"employ the taste and talents, which he has cultivated by the study of English, in improving the standard, and adding to the stock of the poetry of his own language.\"\n\nUnder the [[pseudonym]], Timothy Penpoem, he published his poems in the periodicals he edited.\n\n=== Calcutta Years (1858-1862)<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> ===\nThe period during which he worked as a head clerk and later as the Chief Interpreter in the court, marked his transition to writing in his native Bengali, following the advice of [[John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune|Bethune]] and [[Gour Das Bysack|Bysack]]. He wrote 5 plays:  ''Sermista'' (1859)'', Padmavati'' (1859)'', Ekei Ki Boley Sabyata'' (1860), ''Krishna Kumari'' (1860) ''and Buro Shaliker Ghare Ron'' (1860). Then followed the narrative poems: ''Tilottama Sambhava Kavya'' (1861), ''Meghnad Badh Kavya'' (1861), ''Brajagana Kavya'' (1861) and ''Veerangana Kavya'' (1861). He also translated three plays from Bangla to English, including his own ''Sermista.''\n\n''[[Meghnad Badh Kavya]], The Slaying of Meghnad,'' the story of the final fight and demise of [[Meghnad Indrajit|Meghnad]], the eldest son of [[Ravana]], is unanimously hailed as his magnum opus, although his journey to publication and recognition was far from smooth. However, with its publication, he distinguished himself as a serious composer of an entirely new genre of heroic poetry, that was [[Homeric]] and [[Dante]]sque in technique and style, and yet so fundamentally native in theme. To cite the poet himself: \"''I awoke one morning and found myself famous''.\"  Nevertheless, it took a few years for this epic to win recognition all over the country.\n\n=== Final years (1866-1873)<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> ===\nA volume of his Bangla sonnets was published in 1866.

The earliest known eurypterids date to the [[Darriwilian]] stage of the [[Ordovician]] period 467.3 [[Myr|million years ago]]. The group is likely to have appeared first either during the [[Early Ordovician]] or [[Late Cambrian]] period. With approximately 250 species, the Eurypterida is the most diverse [[Paleozoic]] [[Chelicerata|chelicerate]] order. Following their appearance during the Ordovician, eurypterids became major components of marine faunas during the [[Silurian]], from which the majority of eurypterid species have been described. The Silurian genus ''[[Eurypterus]]'' accounts for more than 90% of all known eurypterid specimens. Though the group continued to diversify during the subsequent [[Devonian]] period, the eurypterids were heavily affected by the [[Late Devonian extinction event]]. They declined in numbers and diversity until becoming extinct during the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event]] (or sometime shortly before) 251.9 million years ago.\n\nAlthough popularly called \"sea scorpions\", only the earliest eurypterids were [[Marine life|marine]]; many later forms lived in [[Brackish water|brackish]] or [[fresh water]], and they were not true [[scorpion]]s. Some studies suggest that a dual [[respiratory system]] was present, which would have allowed for short periods of time in terrestrial environments. The name Eurypterida comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] words \u03b5\u1f50\u03c1\u03cd\u03c2 (''eur\u00fas''), meaning \"broad\" or \"wide\", and \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd (''pteron''), meaning \"wing\", referring to the pair of wide swimming appendages present in many members of the group.\n\nThe eurypterids include the largest known arthropods ever to have lived. The largest, ''[[Jaekelopterus]]'', reached {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us}} in length. Eurypterids were not uniformly large and most species were less than {{convert|20|cm|in|sp=us|0}} long; the smallest eurypterid, ''[[Alkenopterus]]'', was only {{convert|2.03|cm|in|sp=us}} long. Eurypterid fossils have been recovered from every continent. A majority of fossils are from fossil sites in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] because the group lived primarily in the waters around and within the ancient supercontinent of [[Euramerica]]. Only a handful of eurypterid groups spread beyond the confines of Euramerica and a few genera, such as ''[[Adelophthalmus]]'' and ''[[Pterygotus]]'', achieved a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] with fossils being found worldwide.\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Eurypterus_anatomy.png|left|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Eurypterus]]'' with body parts labelled|alt=]]\nLike all other [[arthropod]]s, eurypterids possessed [[Segmentation (biology)|segmented]] bodies and jointed appendages (limbs) covered in a [[cuticle]] composed of [[protein]]s and [[chitin]]. As in other [[chelicerates]], the body was divided into two [[Tagmata (arthropod anatomy)|tagmata]] (sections); the frontal [[prosoma]] (head) and posterior [[opisthosoma]] (abdomen).{{sfn|St\u00f8rmer|1955|p=23}} The prosoma was covered by a [[carapace]] (sometimes called the \"prosomal shield\") on which both [[compound eyes]] and the [[ocelli]] (simple eye-like sensory organs) were located.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}}\n\nThe prosoma also bore six pairs of appendages which are usually referred to as appendage pairs I to VI. The first pair of appendages, the only pair placed before the mouth, is called the [[chelicerae]] ([[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the fangs of spiders). They were equipped with small pincers used to manipulate food fragments and push them into the mouth.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}} In one lineage, the [[Pterygotidae]], the chelicerae were large and long, with strong, well-developed teeth on specialised [[Chela (organ)|chelae]] (claws).{{sfn|Tetlie|Briggs|2009|p=1141}} The subsequent pairs of appendages, numbers II to VI, possessed gnathobases (or \"tooth-plates\") on the [[Arthropod coxa|coxae]] (limb segments) used for feeding. These appendages were generally walking legs that were cylindrical in shape and were covered in spines in some species. In most lineages, the limbs tended to get larger the farther back they were. In the [[Eurypterina]] [[suborder]], the larger of the two eurypterid suborders, the sixth pair of appendages was also modified into a swimming paddle to aid in traversing aquatic environments.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}}\n\nThe opisthosoma comprised 12 segments, and the [[telson]] the posteriormost segment, which in most species took the form of a blade-like shape.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}} In some lineages, notably the [[Pterygotioidea]], the [[Hibbertopteridae]] and the [[Mycteroptidae]], the telson was flattened and may have been used as a rudder while swimming. Some genera within the superfamily [[Carcinosomatoidea]], notably ''[[Eusarcana]]'', had a telson similar to that of modern [[scorpion]]s and may have been capable of using it to inject [[venom]].{{sfn|Plotnick|Baumiller|1988|p=22|pp=}}{{sfn|Clarke|Ruedemann|1912|p=244|pp=}} The coxae of the sixth pair of appendages were overlaid by a plate that is referred to as the metastoma, originally derived from a complete exoskeleton segment. The opisthosoma itself can be divided either into a \"[[mesosoma]]\" (comprising segments 1 to 6) and \"[[metasoma]]\" (comprising segments 7 to 12) or into a \"preabdomen\" (generally comprising segments 1 to 7) and \"postabdomen\" (generally comprising segments 8 to 12).{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}}\n\nThe underside of the opisthosoma was covered in structures evolved from modified opisthosomal appendages. Throughout the opisthosoma, these structures formed plate-like structures termed ''blatf\u00fcsse'' ([[German language|German]] for \"leaf-feet\"). These created a branchial chamber (gill tract) between preceding ''blatf\u00fcsse'' and the [[ventral]] surface of the opisthosoma itself, which contained the respiratory organs. The second to sixth opisthosomal segments also contained oval or triangular organs that have been interpreted as organs that aid in respiration. These organs, termed ''kiemenplatten'', or \"gill tracts\", would potentially have aided eurypterids to breath air above water, while ''blatf\u00fcssen'', similar to organs in modern [[horseshoe crab]]s, would cover the parts that serve for [[underwater respiration]].{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}}\n\nThe appendages of opisthosomal segments 1 and 2 (the seventh and eighth segments overall) were fused into a structure termed the genital operculum, occupying most of the underside of the opisthosomal segment 2. Near the [[anterior]] margin of this structure, the genital appendage (also called the ''zipfel'' or the median abdominal appendage) protruded. This appendage, often preserved very prominently, has consistently been interpreted as part of the reproductive system and occurs in two recognized types, assumed to correspond to male and female.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}}\n\n==Biology==\n\n===Size===\n[[File:Mega-Eurypterids.svg|thumb|Size comparison of six of the largest eurypterid species, in the genera ''[[Jaekelopterus]]'', ''[[Carcinosoma]]'', ''[[Acutiramus]]'' (two species), ''[[Pterygotus]]'' and ''[[Pentecopterus]]'']]\nEurypterids were highly variable in size, depending on factors such as lifestyle, living environment and [[Affinity (taxonomy)|taxonomic affinity]].

An isolated {{convert|12.7|cm|in|sp=us}} long fossil metastoma of the carcinosomatoid eurypterid ''[[Carcinosoma|Carcinosoma punctatum]]'' indicates the animal would have reached a length of {{convert|2.2|m|ft|sp=us}} in life, rivalling the pterygotids in size.{{sfn|Kjellesvig-Waering|1961|pp=|p=830}} Another giant was ''[[Pentecopterus|Pentecopterus decorahensis]]'', a primitive carcinosomatoid, which is estimated to have reached lengths of {{convert|1.7|m|ft|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Briggs|Liu|pp=|5=2015|p=15|Witzke}}\n\nTypical of large eurypterids is a lightweight build. Factors such as locomotion, energy costs in [[molting]] and respiration, as well as the actual physical properties of the [[exoskeleton]], limits the size that arthropods can reach. A lightweight construction significantly decreases the influence of these factors. Pterygotids were particularly lightweight, with most fossilized large body segments preserving as thin and unmineralized.{{sfn|Braddy|Poschmann|Tetlie|pp=|p=107|2008}} Lightweight adaptations are present in other giant paleozoic arthropods as well, such as the giant millipede ''[[Arthropleura]]'', and are possibly vital for the evolution of giant size in arthropods.{{sfn|Braddy|Poschmann|Tetlie|pp=|p=107|2008}}{{sfn|Kraus|Brauckmann|2003|pp=5\u201350|p=}}\n\nIn addition to the lightweight giant eurypterids, some deep-bodied forms in the family Hibbertopteridae were also very large. A carapace from the Carboniferous of Scotland referred to the species ''Hibbertoperus scouleri'' measures {{cvt|65|cm}} wide. As ''Hibbertopterus'' was very wide compared to its length, the animal in question could possibly have measured just short of {{convert|2|m|ft|sp=us}} in length.

In the Stylonurina, this appendage takes the form of a long and slender walking leg, while in the Eurypterina, the leg is modified and broadened into a swimming paddle.{{sfn|Tetlie|2007|pp=|p=559}} Other than the swimming paddle, the legs of many eurypterines were far too small to do much more than allow them to crawl across the [[sea floor]]. In contrast, a number of stylonurines had elongated and powerful legs that might have allowed them to walk on land (similar to modern [[crab]]s).{{sfn|Palaeos||p=}}\n\nA [[fossil trackway]] was discovered in Carboniferous-aged fossil deposits of Scotland in 2005 It was attributed to the stylonurine eurypterid ''Hibbertopterus'' due to a matching size (the trackmaker was estimated to have been about {{convert|1.6|m|ft|sp=us}} long) and inferred leg anatomy. It is the largest terrestrial trackway\u2014measuring {{convert|6|m|ft|sp=us}} long and averaging {{convert|95|cm|ft|sp=us}} in width\u2014made by an arthropod found thus far. It is the first record of land locomotion by a eurypterid. The trackway provides evidence that some eurypterids could survive in terrestrial environments, at least for short periods of time, and reveals information about the stylonurine gait. In ''Hibbertopterus'', as in most eurypterids, the pairs of appendages are different in size (referred to as a heteropodous limb condition). These differently sized pairs would have moved in phase, and the short stride length indicates that ''Hibbertopterus'' crawled with an exceptionally slow speed, at least on land. The large telson was dragged along the ground and left a large central groove behind the animal. Slopes in the tracks at random intervals suggest that the motion was jerky.{{sfn|Whyte|2005|p=576}} The gait of smaller stylonurines, such as ''[[Parastylonurus]]'', was probably faster and more precise.{{sfn|Selden|1999|p=43|pp=}}\n\nThe functionality of the eurypterine swimming paddles varied from group to group. In the [[Eurypteroidea]], the paddles were similar in shape to oars. The condition of the joints in their appendages ensured their paddles could only be moved in near-horizontal planes, not upwards or downwards. Some other groups, such as the Pterygotioidea, would not have possessed this condition and were probably able to swim faster.{{sfn|Selden|1999|p=45}} Most eurypterines are generally agreed to have utilized a rowing type of propulsion similar to that of crabs and [[water beetle]]s. Larger individuals may have been capable of underwater flying (or [[Aquatic locomotion|subaqueous flight]]) in which the motion and shape of the paddles are enough to generate [[Lift (force)|lift]], similar to the swimming of [[sea turtle]]s and [[sea lion]]s. This type of movement has a relatively slower acceleration rate than the rowing type, especially since adults have proportionally smaller paddles than juveniles. However, since the larger sizes of adults mean a higher [[drag coefficient]], using this type of propulsion is more energy-efficient.{{sfn|Selden|1999|p=|pp=44\u201346}}\n[[File:Palmichnium kosinskiorum (eurypterid tracks).jpg|thumb|The [[holotype]] of ''[[Palmichnium|Palmichnium kosinkiorum]]'', containing the largest eurypterid footprints known.]]\nSome eurypterines, such as ''[[Mixopterus]]'' (as inferred from attributed fossil trackways), were not necessarily good swimmers. It likely kept mostly to the bottom, using its swimming paddles for occasional bursts of movements vertically, with the fourth and fifth pairs of appendages positioned backwards to produce minor movement forwards. While walking, it probably used a gait like that of most modern insects. The weight of its long abdomen would have been balanced by two heavy and specialized frontal appendages, and the [[center of gravity]] might have been adjustable by raising and positioning the tail.{{sfn|Hanken|St\u00f8rmer|p=|pp=262\u2013267|1975}}\n\nPreserved fossilized eurypterid trackways tend to be large and heteropodous and often have an associated telson drag mark along the mid-line (as with the Scottish ''Hibbertopterus'' track). Such trackways have been discovered on every continent except for South America. In some places where eurypterid fossil remains are otherwise rare, such as in [[South Africa]] and the rest of the former supercontinent [[Gondwana]], the discoveries of trackways both predate and outnumber eurypterid body fossils.{{sfn|Braddy|Almond|p=166|pp=|1999}} Eurypterid trackways have been referred to several ichnogenera, most notably ''[[Palmichnium]]'' (defined as a series of four tracks often with an associated drag mark in the mid-line),{{sfn|Braddy|Almond|p=|pp=168\u2013170|1999}} wherein the holotype of the ichnospecies ''P. kosinkiorum'' preserves the largest eurypterid footprints known to date with the found tracks each being about {{convert|7.6|cm|in|sp=us}} in diameter.{{sfn|Brezinski|Kollar|p=39|pp=|2016}} Other eurypterid ichnogenera include ''[[Merostomichnites]]'' (though it is likely that many specimens actually represent trackways of crustaceans) and ''[[Arcuites]]'' (which preserves grooves made by the swimming appendages).{{sfn|Braddy|Almond|p=|pp=168\u2013170|1999}}{{sfn|Hanken|St\u00f8rmer|p=255|pp=|1975}}{{sfn|Vrazo|Ciurca|p=235|pp=|2017}}\n\n===Respiration===\n[[File:Oniscus asellus - male side 2 (aka).jpg|left|thumb|The supposed \"gill tracts\" of eurypterids have been compared to the air-breathing [[Pseudotrachea|pseudotrachae]] present in the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] legs of modern [[Isopoda|isopods]], such as ''[[Oniscus]]'' (pictured).]]\nIn eurypterids, the respiratory organs were located on the ventral body wall (the underside of the opisthosoma). ''Blatf\u00fcsse'', evolved from opisthosomal appendages, covered the underside and created a gill chamber where the ''kiemenplatten'' (gill tracts) were located.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}} Depending on the species, the eurypterid gill tract was either triangular or oval in shape and was possibly raised into a cushion-like state. The surface of this gill tract bore several [[spinule]]s (small spines), which resulted in an enlarged surface area. It was composed of spongy tissue due to many [[invagination]]s in the structure.{{sfn|Selden|1985|p=219|pp=}}\n\nThough the ''kiemenplatte'' is referred to as a \"gill tract\", it may not necessarily have functioned as actual gills. In other animals, gills are used for oxygen uptake from water and are outgrowths of the body wall. Despite eurypterids clearly being primarily aquatic animals that almost certainly evolved underwater (some eurypterids, such as the pterygotids, would even have been physically unable to walk on land), it is unlikely the gill tract contained functional gills when comparing the organ to gills in other invertebrates and even fish. Previous interpretations often identified the eurypterid \"gills\" as homologous with those of other groups (hence the terminology), with gas exchange occurring within the spongy tract and a pattern of branchio-cardiac and dendritic veins (as in related groups) carrying oxygenated blood into the body. The primary analogy used in previous studies has been horseshoe crabs, though their gill structure and that of eurypterids are remarkably different. In horseshoe crabs, the gills are more complex and composed of many lamellae (plates) which give a larger surface area used for gas exchange. In addition, the gill tract of eurypterids is proportionally much too small to support them if it is analogous to the gills of other groups. To be functional gills, they would have to have been highly efficient and would have required a highly efficient circulatory system. It is considered unlikely, however, that these factors would be enough to explain the large discrepancy between gill tract size and body size.{{sfn|Selden|1985|p=|pp=220\u2013221}}\n\nIt has been suggested instead that the \"gill tract\" was an organ for breathing air, perhaps actually being a [[lung]], [[Plastron (arthropod)|plastron]] or a [[pseudotrachea]].{{sfn|Selden|1985|p=221|pp=}} Plastrons are organs that some arthropods evolved secondarily to breathe air underwater. This is considered an unlikely explanation since eurypterids had evolved in water from the start and they  would not have organs evolved from air-breathing organs present. In addition, plastrons are generally exposed on outer parts of the body while the eurypterid gill tract is located behind the ''blatf\u00fcssen''.{{sfn|Selden|1985|p=222|pp=}} Instead, among arthropod respiratory organs, the eurypterid gill tracts most closely resemble the pseudotrachae found in modern [[Isopoda|isopods]]. These organs, called pseudotrachae, because of some resemblance to the [[Trachea|trachae]] (windpipes) of air-breathing organisms, are lung-like and present within the [[pleopods]] (back legs) of isopods. The structure of the pseudotrachae has been compared to the spongy structure of the eurypterid gill tracts. It is possible the two organs functioned in the same way.{{sfn|Selden|1985|p=|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nSome researchers have suggested that eurypterids may have been adapted to an amphibious lifestyle, using the full gill tract structure as gills and the invaginations within it as pseudotrachea. This mode of life may not have been physiologically possible, however, since water pressure would have forced water into the invaginations leading to [[asphyxiation]]. Furthermore, most eurypterids would have been aquatic their entire lives. No matter how much time was spent on land, organs for respiration in underwater environments must have been present. True gills, expected to have been located within the branchial chamber within the ''blatf\u00fcssen'', remain unknown in eurypterids.{{sfn|Selden|1985|p=|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\n===Ontogeny===\n[[File:Strobilopterus proteus juveniles.jpg|thumb|[[Larva]]l (left) and juvenile (right) [[instar]]s of ''[[Strobilopterus]]'' (not to scale)]]\nLike all arthropods, eurypterids matured and grew through static developmental stages referred to as [[instar]]s. These instars were punctuated by periods during which eurypterids went through [[ecdysis]] (molting of the cuticle) after which they underwent rapid and immediate growth. Some arthropods, such as insects and many crustaceans, undergo extreme changes over the course of maturing. Chelicerates, including eurypterids, are in general considered to be direct developers, undergoing no extreme changes after hatching (though extra body segments and extra limbs may be gained over the course of [[ontogeny]] in some lineages, such as [[xiphosura]]ns and [[sea spider]]s). Whether eurypterids were true direct developers (with hatchlings more or less being identical to adults) or hemianamorphic direct developers (with extra segments and limbs potentially being added during ontogeny) has been controversial in the past.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Selden|p=32|pp=|2013}}\n\nHemianamorphic direct development has been observed in many arthropod groups, such as [[trilobite]]s, [[megacheira]]ns, basal [[crustacean]]s and basal [[Myriapoda|myriapods]]. True direct development has on occasion been referred to as a trait unique to [[arachnid]]s. There have been few studies on eurypterid ontogeny as there is a general lack of specimens in the fossil record that can confidently be stated to represent juveniles.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Selden|p=32|pp=|2013}} It is possible that many eurypterid species thought to be distinct actually represent juvenile specimens of other species, with paleontologists rarely considering the influence of ontogeny when describing new species.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Selden|p=33|pp=|2013}}\n\nStudies on a well-preserved fossil assemblage of eurypterids from the [[Pragian]]-aged [[Beartooth Butte Formation]] in [[Cottonwood Canyon (Wyoming)|Cottonwood Canyon]], [[Wyoming]], composed of multiple specimens of various developmental stages of eurypterids ''Jaekelopterus'' and ''[[Strobilopterus]]'', revealed that eurypterid ontogeny was more or less parallel and similar to that of extinct and extant xiphosurans, with the largest exception being that eurypterids hatched with a full set of appendages and opisthosomal segments. Eurypterids were thus not hemianamorphic direct developers, but true direct developers like modern arachnids.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Selden|p=44|pp=|2013}}\n\nThe most frequently observed change occurring through ontogeny (except for some genera, such as ''Eurypterus'', which appear to have been static) is the metastoma becoming proportionally less wide. This ontogenetic change has been observed in members of several superfamilies, such as the Eurypteroidea, the Pterygotioidea and the [[Moselopteroidea]].{{sfn|Lamsdell|Selden|p=34|pp=|2013}}\n\n===Feeding===\n[[File:Pterygotus abelov.jpg|thumb|''[[Pterygotus]]'' depicted hunting ''[[Birkenia]]''.]]\nNo fossil gut contents from eurypterids are known so direct evidence of their diet is lacking. The eurypterid biology is particularly suggestive of a carnivorous lifestyle. Not only were many large (in general, most predators tend to be larger than their prey), but they had [[stereoscopic vision]] (the ability to perceive depth).{{sfn|Selden|1999|p=46|pp=\u2013}} The legs of many eurypterids were covered in thin spines, used both for locomotion and the gathering of food. In some groups, these spiny appendages became heavily specialized. In some eurypterids in the Carcinosomatoidea, forward-facing appendages were large and possessed enormously elongated spines (as in ''Mixopterus'' and ''[[Megalograptus]]''). In [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|derived]] members of the Pterygotioidea, the appendages were completely without spines, but had specialized claws instead.{{sfn|Selden|1999|p=47|pp=}} Other eurypterids, lacking these specialized appendages, likely fed in a manner similar to modern horseshoe crabs, by grabbing and shredding food with their appendages before pushing it into their mouth using their chelicerae.{{sfn|Hembree|Platt|Smith|pp=|p=77|2014}}\n\nFossils preserving [[digestive tracts]] have been reported from fossils of various eurypterids, among them ''Carcinosoma'', ''Acutiramus'' and ''[[Eurypterus]]''. Though a potential anal opening has been reported from the telson of a specimen of ''[[Buffalopterus]]'', it is more likely that the [[anus]] was opened through the thin cuticle between the last segment before the telson and the telson itself, as in modern horseshoe crabs.{{sfn|Selden|1999|p=46|pp=\u2013}}\n\nEurypterid coprolites discovered in deposits of Ordovician age in Ohio containing fragments of a trilobite and eurypterid ''Megalograptus ohioensis'' in association with full specimens of the same eurypterid species have been suggested to represent evidence of [[cannibalism]].

The seventh segment (thus the first opisthosomal segment) is referred to as the ''metastoma'' and the eighth segment (distinctly plate-like) is called the ''operculum'' and contains the genital aperature. The underside of this segment is occupied by the genital operculum, a structure originally evolved from ancestral seventh and eighth pair of appendages. In its center, as in modern horseshoe crabs, is a genital appendage. This appendage, an elongated rod with an internal duct, is found in two distinct morphs, generally referred to as \"type A\" and \"type B\".{{sfn|Palaeos||p=}} These genital appendages are often preserved prominently in fossils and have been the subject of various  interpretations of eurypterid reproduction and sexual dimorphism.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=|p=436}}\n\nType A appendages are generally longer than those of type B. In some genera they are divided into different numbers of sections, such as in ''Eurypterus'' where the type A appendage is divided into three but the type B appendage into only two.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=|p=438}} Such division of the genital appendage is common in eurypterids, but the number is not universal; for instance, the appendages of both types in the family Pterygotidae are undivided.{{sfn|Braddy|Poschmann|Tetlie|pp=|p=108|2008}} The type A appendage is also armed with two curved spines called ''furca'' ([[Latin]] for \"fork\"). The presence of ''furca'' in the type B appendage is also possible and the structure may represent the unfused tips of the appendages. Located between the [[Dorsal (anatomy)|dorsal]] and ventral surfaces of the ''blatfuss'' associated with the type A appendages is a set of organs traditionally described as either \"tubular organs\" or \"horn organs\". These organs are most often interpreted as [[spermatheca]]e (organs for storing [[sperm]]), though this function is yet to be proven conclusively.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=|p=439}} In arthropods, spermathecae are used to store the [[spermatophore]] received from males. This would imply that the type A appendage is the female morph and the type B appendage is the male.{{sfn|Palaeos||p=}} Further evidence for the type A appendages representing the female morph of genital appendages comes in their more complex construction (a general trend for female arthropod genitalia). It is possible that the greater length of the type A appendage means that it was used as an [[ovipositor]] (used to deposit eggs).{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=|p=449}} The different types of genital appendages are not necessarily the only feature that distinguishes between the sexes of eurypterids. Depending on the genus and species in question, other features such as size, the amount of ornamentation and the proportional width of the body can be the result of sexual dimorphism.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}} In general, eurypterids with type B appendages (males) appear to have been proportionally wider than eurypterids with type A appendages (females) of the same genera.{{sfn|Lamsdell|2014|p=|pp=175\u2013177}}\n\nThe primary function of the long, assumed female, type A appendages was likely to take up spermatophore from the substrate into the [[reproductive tract]] rather than to serve as an ovipositor, as arthropod ovipositors are generally longer than eurypterid type A appendages. By rotating the sides of the operculum, it would have been possible to lower the appendage from the body. Due to the way different plates overlay at its location, the appendage would have been impossible to move without muscular contractions moving around the operculum. It would have been kept in place when not it use. The ''furca'' on the type A appendages may have aided in breaking open the spermatophore to release the free sperm inside for uptake. The \"horn organs,\" possibly spermathecae, are thought to have been connected directly to the appendage via tracts, but these supposed tracts remain unpreserved in available fossil material.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=450\u2013452|p=}}\n\nType B appendages, assumed male, would have produced, stored and perhaps shaped spermatophore in a heart-shaped structure on the dorsal surface of the appendage. A broad genital opening would have allowed large amounts of spermatophore to be released at once. The long ''furca'' associated with type B appendages, perhaps capable of being lowered like the type A appendage, could have been used to detect whether a substrate was suitable for spermatophore deposition.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=454\u2013455|p=}}\n\n==Evolutionary history==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Eurypterids Pentecopterus Vertical.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of ''[[Pentecopterus]]'', the earliest known eurypterid.

The description of ''Eurypterus fischeri'' by Gerhard Holm in 1896 was so elaborate that the species became one of the most completely known of all extinct animals, so much so that the knowledge of ''E. fischeri'' was comparable with the knowledge of its modern relatives (such as the [[Atlantic horseshoe crab]]).

Several homologies encourage this view, such as correlating segments of the appendages and the prosoma. Additionally, the presence of plate-like appendages bearing the \"gill tracts\" on appendages of the opisthosoma (the ''blatf\u00fcssen'') was cited early as an important homology. In the last few decades of the nineteenth century, further homologies were established, such as the similar structures of the compound eyes of ''Pterygotus'' and horseshoe crabs (seen as especially decisive as the eye of the horseshoe crab was seen as possessing an almost unique structure) and similarities in the ontogeny within both groups.{{sfn|Clarke|Ruedemann|1912|p=135|pp=}} These ontogenetical similarities were seen as most apparent when studying the [[nepionic stage]]s (the developmental stage immediately following the embryonic stage) in both groups, during which both xiphosurans and eurypterids have a proportionally larger carapace than adults, are generally broader, possess a distinct ridge down the middle, have a lesser number of segments which lack differentiation and have an underdeveloped telson.{{sfn|Clarke|Ruedemann|1912|p=136|pp=}}\n\nDue to these similarities, the xiphosurans and eurypterids have often been united under a single class or [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]] called Merostomata (erected to house both groups by Henry Woodward in 1866). Though xiphosurans (like the eurypterids) were historically seen as crustaceans due to their respiratory system and their aquatic lifestyle, this hypothesis was discredited after numerous similarities were discovered between the horseshoe crabs and the arachnids.{{sfn|Clarke|Ruedemann|1912|p=136|pp=}} Some authors, such as [[John Sterling Kingsley]] in 1894, classified the Merostomata as a sister group to the Arachnida under the class \"Acerata\" within a subphylum \"Branchiata\".

In most eurypterids of the suborder [[Eurypterina]], such as ''[[Bassipterus]]'' (top), this leg is modified into a swimming paddle. In eurypterids of the suborder [[Stylonurina]], such as ''[[Parastylonurus]]'' (bottom), it is not.}}The internal classification of eurypterids within the Eurypterida is based mainly on eleven established characters. These have been used throughout the history of eurypterid research to establish clades and genera. These characters include: the shape of the prosoma, the shape of the metastoma, the shape and position of the eyes, the types of prosomal appendages, the types of swimming leg paddles, the structure of the doublure (the fringe of the dorsal exoskeleton), the structure of the opithosoma, the structure of the genital appendages, the shape of the telson and the type of ornamentation present. It is worth noting that not all of these characters are of equal taxonomic importance.{{sfn|Tollerton|1989|p=642|pp=}} They are not applicable to all eurypterids either; stylonurine eurypterids lack swimming leg paddles entirely.{{sfn|Tetlie|2007|pp=|p=559}} Some characters, including the prosoma and metastoma shapes and the position and shapes of the eyes, are seen as important only for the distinction between different genera.{{sfn|Tollerton|1989|p=|pp=642\u2013644}} Most superfamilies and families are defined based on the morphology of the appendages.{{sfn|Tollerton|1989|p=649|pp=}}\n\nThe most important character used in eurypterid taxonomy is the type of prosomal appendages as this character is used to define entire suborders. General leg anatomy can also be used to define superfamilies and families. Historically, the chelicerae were considered the most important appendages from a taxonomical standpoint since they only occurred in two general types: a eurypterid type with small and toothless pincers and a pterygotid type with large pincers and teeth. This distinction has historically been used to divide the Eurypterida into the two suborders Eurypterina (small chelicerae) and \"Pterygotina\" (large and powerful chelicerae).{{sfn|Tollerton|1989|p=646|pp=}} This classification scheme is not without problems. In Victor Tollerton's 1989 taxonomic revision of the Eurypterida, with suborders Eurypterina and Pterygotina recognized, several clades of eurypterids today recognized as stylonurines (including hibbertopterids and mycteroptids) were reclassified as non-eurypterids in the new separate order \"Cyrtoctenida\" on the grounds of perceived inconsistencies in the prosomal appendages.{{sfn|Tollerton|1989|p=650|pp=}}\n\nModern research favors a classification into suborders Eurypterina and Stylonurina instead, supported by phylogenetic analyses.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Briggs|Liu|pp=|5=2015|p=25|Witzke}}{{sfn|Lamsdell|Selden|2013|p=34|pp=}} In particular, pterygotid eurypterids share a number of homologies with derived eurypterine eurypterids such as the adelophthalmids, and are thus best classified as derived members of the same suborder.{{sfn|Tetlie|Cuggy|2007|pp=|p=350}} In the Stylonurina, the sixth pair of appendages is represented by long and slender walking legs and lack a modified spine (referred to as the podomere 7a). In most eurypterids in the Eurypterina, the sixth pair of appendages is broadened into swimming paddles and always has a podomere 7a. 75% of eurypterid species are eurypterines and they represent 99% of all fossil eurypterid specimens.{{sfn|Tetlie|2007|pp=|p=559}} Of all eurypterid clades, the Pterygotioidea is the most species-rich, with over 50 species. The second most species-rich clade is the Adelophthalmoidea, with over 40 species.{{sfn|Tetlie|2007|pp=|p=570}}\n\nThe cladogram presented below, covering all currently recognized eurypterid families, follows a 2007 study by O. Erik Tetlie.{{sfn|Tetlie|2007|pp=|p=565}} The stylonurine suborder follows a 2010 study by James Lamsdell, Simon J. Braddy and Tetlie.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Braddy|Tetlie|pp=|p=56|2010}} The superfamily \"Megalograptoidea\", recognized by Tetlie in 2007 and then placed between the [[Onychopterelloidea]] and Eurypteroidea, has been omitted as more recent studies suggest that the megalograptids were members of the superfamily Carcinosomatoidea. As such, the phylogeny of the Carcinosomatoidea follows a 2015 study by Lamsdell and colleagues.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Briggs|Liu|pp=|5=2015|p=3|Witzke}}\n\n{{clade|{{clade\n |label1=[[Stylonurina]]\n |1={{clade\n  | 1= [[Rhenopteridae]] [[File:Brachyopterus restoration.png|50px]]\n  | 2={{clade\n   |label1=[[Stylonuroidea]]\n   | 1={{clade\n    | 1= [[Parastylonuridae]]\n    | 2= [[Stylonuridae]] [[File:Stylonurus BW white background.png|45px]]\n}}\n   | 2={{clade\n    |label1=[[Kokomopteroidea]]\n    | 1={{clade\n     | 1= [[Hardieopteridae]]\n     | 2= [[Kokomopteridae]]\n}}\n    |label2= [[Mycteropoidea]] \n    | 2={{clade\n     | 1= [[Drepanopteridae]]\n     | 2={{clade\n      | 1= [[Hibbertopteridae]] [[File:Hibbertopterus scouleri.jpg|60px]]\n      | 2= [[Mycteroptidae]] [[File:Megarachne BW.jpg|55px]]\n}} }} }} }} }}\n |label2=[[Eurypterina]]\n |2={{clade\n  | 1= [[Moselopteridae]] [[File:Stoermeropterus.png|55px]]\n  | 2={{clade\n   | 1= [[Onychopterellidae]]\n   | 2={{clade\n    |label1= [[Eurypteroidea]] \n    | 1={{clade\n     | 1= [[Dolichopteridae]]\n     | 2={{clade\n      | 1= [[Eurypteridae]] [[File:Eurypterus Paleoart (no background).png|55px]]\n      | 2= [[Strobilopteridae]]\n}} }}\n    |label2=[[Diploperculata]]\n    | 2={{clade\n     |label1= [[Carcinosomatoidea]] \n     | 1={{clade\n      | 1= [[Megalograptidae]] \n      | 2={{clade\n       | 1= [[Carcinosomatidae]] [[File:Carcinosoma newlini.png|55px]]\n       | 2= [[Mixopteridae]] [[File:Mixopterus BW.jpg|60px]]\n}} }}\n     | 2={{clade\n      | 1= [[Waeringopteridae]]\n      | 2={{clade\n       | 1= [[Adelophthalmidae]] [[File:Adelophthalmus irinae.png|40px]]\n       |label2= [[Pterygotioidea]] \n       | 2={{clade\n        | 1= [[Hughmilleriidae]]\n        | 2={{clade\n         | 1= [[Pterygotidae]] [[File:Pterygotus anglicus reconstruction.jpg|60px]]\n         | 2= [[Slimonidae]] [[File:Slimonia acuminata reconstruction.jpg|60px]]\n}} }} }} }} }} }} }} }} }}|label1='''Eurypterida'''}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arthropods|Palaeontology}}\n* [[List of eurypterid genera]]\n* [[Nepidae]]\u2014an unrelated family of insects, commonly known as \"water scorpions\".\n* [[Cottidae]]\u2014family of fishes in which some members contain \"sea scorpion\" in their common name.\n* [[Evolutionary history of life]]\n\n== References ==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n*{{Cite book|title=Evolution|last=Bergstrom|first=Carl T.|publisher=Norton|year=2012|isbn=978-0393913415|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFBergstromDugatkin2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SeaEZwEACAAJ|last2=Dugatkin|first2=Lee Alan}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Braddy|first=Simon J.|last2=Dunlop|first2=Jason A.|date=1997|title=The functional morphology of mating in the Silurian eurypterid, ''Baltoeurypterus tetragonophthalmus'' (Fischer, 1839)|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=120|issue=4|pages=435\u2013461|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1997.tb01282.x|issn=0024-4082|ref=CITEREFBraddyDunlop1997}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Braddy|first=Simon J.|last2=Almond|first2=John E.|date=1999|title=Eurypterid trackways from the Table Mountain Group (Ordovician) of South Africa|journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences|volume=29|issue=1|pages=165\u2013177|doi=10.1016/S0899-5362(99)00087-1|issn=|ref=CITEREFBraddyAlmond1999|bibcode=1999JAfES..29..165B}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Braddy|first=Simon J.|last2=Poschmann|first2=Markus|date=2008|title=Giant claw reveals the largest ever arthropod|journal=Biology Letters|volume=4|issue=1|pages=106\u2013109|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0491|ref=CITEREFBraddyPoschmannTetlie2008|first3=O.

The earliest known eurypterids date to the [[Darriwilian]] stage of the [[Ordovician]] period 467.3 [[Myr|million years ago]]. The group is likely to have appeared first either during the [[Early Ordovician]] or [[Late Cambrian]] period. With approximately 250 species, the Eurypterida is the most diverse [[Paleozoic]] [[Chelicerata|chelicerate]] order. Following their appearance during the Ordovician, eurypterids became major components of marine faunas during the [[Silurian]], from which the majority of eurypterid species have been described. The Silurian genus ''[[Eurypterus]]'' accounts for more than 90% of all known eurypterid specimens. Though the group continued to diversify during the subsequent [[Devonian]] period, the eurypterids were heavily affected by the [[Late Devonian extinction event]]. They declined in numbers and diversity until becoming extinct during the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event]] (or sometime shortly before) 251.9 million years ago.\n\nAlthough popularly called \"sea scorpions\", only the earliest eurypterids were [[Marine life|marine]]; many later forms lived in [[Brackish water|brackish]] or [[fresh water]], and they were not true [[scorpion]]s. Some studies suggest that a dual [[respiratory system]] was present, which would have allowed for short periods of time in terrestrial environments. The name Eurypterida comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] words \u03b5\u1f50\u03c1\u03cd\u03c2 (''eur\u00fas''), meaning \"broad\" or \"wide\", and \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd (''pteron''), meaning \"wing\", referring to the pair of wide swimming appendages present in many members of the group.\n\nThe eurypterids include the largest known arthropods ever to have lived. The largest, ''[[Jaekelopterus]]'', reached {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us}} in length. Eurypterids were not uniformly large and most species were less than {{convert|20|cm|in|sp=us|0}} long; the smallest eurypterid, ''[[Alkenopterus]]'', was only {{convert|2.03|cm|in|sp=us}} long. Eurypterid fossils have been recovered from every continent. A majority of fossils are from fossil sites in [[North America]] and [[Europe]] because the group lived primarily in the waters around and within the ancient supercontinent of [[Euramerica]]. Only a handful of eurypterid groups spread beyond the confines of Euramerica and a few genera, such as ''[[Adelophthalmus]]'' and ''[[Pterygotus]]'', achieved a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] with fossils being found worldwide.\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Eurypterus_anatomy.png|left|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Eurypterus]]'' with body parts labelled|alt=]]\nLike all other [[arthropod]]s, eurypterids possessed [[Segmentation (biology)|segmented]] bodies and jointed appendages (limbs) covered in a [[cuticle]] composed of [[protein]]s and [[chitin]]. As in other [[chelicerates]], the body was divided into two [[Tagmata (arthropod anatomy)|tagmata]] (sections); the frontal [[prosoma]] (head) and posterior [[opisthosoma]] (abdomen).{{sfn|St\u00f8rmer|1955|p=23}} The prosoma was covered by a [[carapace]] (sometimes called the \"prosomal shield\") on which both [[compound eyes]] and the [[ocelli]] (simple eye-like sensory organs) were located.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}}\n\nThe prosoma also bore six pairs of appendages which are usually referred to as appendage pairs I to VI. The first pair of appendages, the only pair placed before the mouth, is called the [[chelicerae]] ([[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the fangs of spiders). They were equipped with small pincers used to manipulate food fragments and push them into the mouth.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}} In one lineage, the [[Pterygotidae]], the chelicerae were large and long, with strong, well-developed teeth on specialised [[Chela (organ)|chelae]] (claws).{{sfn|Tetlie|Briggs|2009|p=1141}} The subsequent pairs of appendages, numbers II to VI, possessed gnathobases (or \"tooth-plates\") on the [[Arthropod coxa|coxae]] (limb segments) used for feeding. These appendages were generally walking legs that were cylindrical in shape and were covered in spines in some species. In most lineages, the limbs tended to get larger the farther back they were. In the [[Eurypterina]] [[suborder]], the larger of the two eurypterid suborders, the sixth pair of appendages was also modified into a swimming paddle to aid in traversing aquatic environments.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}}\n\nThe opisthosoma comprised 12 segments, and the [[telson]] the posteriormost segment, which in most species took the form of a blade-like shape.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}} In some lineages, notably the [[Pterygotioidea]], the [[Hibbertopteridae]] and the [[Mycteroptidae]], the telson was flattened and may have been used as a rudder while swimming. Some genera within the superfamily [[Carcinosomatoidea]], notably ''[[Eusarcana]]'', had a telson similar to that of modern [[scorpion]]s and may have been capable of using it to inject [[venom]].{{sfn|Plotnick|Baumiller|1988|p=22|pp=}}{{sfn|Clarke|Ruedemann|1912|p=244|pp=}} The coxae of the sixth pair of appendages were overlaid by a plate that is referred to as the metastoma, originally derived from a complete exoskeleton segment. The opisthosoma itself can be divided either into a \"[[mesosoma]]\" (comprising segments 1 to 6) and \"[[metasoma]]\" (comprising segments 7 to 12) or into a \"preabdomen\" (generally comprising segments 1 to 7) and \"postabdomen\" (generally comprising segments 8 to 12).{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}}\n\nThe underside of the opisthosoma was covered in structures evolved from modified opisthosomal appendages. Throughout the opisthosoma, these structures formed plate-like structures termed ''blatf\u00fcsse'' ([[German language|German]] for \"leaf-feet\"). These created a branchial chamber (gill tract) between preceding ''blatf\u00fcsse'' and the [[ventral]] surface of the opisthosoma itself, which contained the respiratory organs. The second to sixth opisthosomal segments also contained oval or triangular organs that have been interpreted as organs that aid in respiration. These organs, termed ''kiemenplatten'', or \"gill tracts\", would potentially have aided eurypterids to breath air above water, while ''blatf\u00fcssen'', similar to organs in modern [[horseshoe crab]]s, would cover the parts that serve for [[underwater respiration]].{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}}\n\nThe appendages of opisthosomal segments 1 and 2 (the seventh and eighth segments overall) were fused into a structure termed the genital operculum, occupying most of the underside of the opisthosomal segment 2. Near the [[anterior]] margin of this structure, the genital appendage (also called the ''zipfel'' or the median abdominal appendage) protruded. This appendage, often preserved very prominently, has consistently been interpreted as part of the reproductive system and occurs in two recognized types, assumed to correspond to male and female.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}}\n\n==Biology==\n\n===Size===\n[[File:Mega-Eurypterids.svg|thumb|Size comparison of six of the largest eurypterid species, in the genera ''[[Jaekelopterus]]'', ''[[Carcinosoma]]'', ''[[Acutiramus]]'' (two species), ''[[Pterygotus]]'' and ''[[Pentecopterus]]'']]\nEurypterids were highly variable in size, depending on factors such as lifestyle, living environment and [[Affinity (taxonomy)|taxonomic affinity]]. Sizes around {{convert|100|cm|ft|sp=us}} are common in most eurypterid groups.{{sfn|Tetlie|2007|pp=|p=557}} The smallest eurypterid, ''[[Alkenopterus|Alkenopterus burglahrensis]]'', measured just {{convert|2.03|cm|in|sp=us}} in length.{{sfn|Poschmann|Tetlie|pp=|p=189|2004}}\n\nThe largest eurypterid, and the largest known arthropod ever to have lived, is ''[[Jaekelopterus rhenaniae]]''. A chelicera from the [[Emsian]] [[Klerf Formation]] of Willwerath, [[Germany]] measured {{convert|36.4|cm|in|sp=us}} in length, but is missing a quarter of its length, suggesting that the full chelicera would have been {{convert|45.5|cm|in|sp=us}} long. If the proportions between body length and chelicerae match those of its closest relatives, where the ratio between claw size and body length is relatively consistent, the specimen of ''Jaekelopterus'' that possessed the chelicera in question would have measured between {{convert|233|and|259|cm|sp=us|ft}}, an average {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us}}, in length. With the chelicerae extended, another meter (3.28&nbsp;ft) would be added to this length. This estimate exceeds the maximum body size of all other known giant arthropods by almost half a meter (1.64&nbsp;ft) even if the extended chelicerae are not included.{{sfn|Braddy|Poschmann|Tetlie|pp=|p=107|2008}} Two other eurypterids have also been estimated to have reached lengths of 2.5 metres; ''[[Erettopterus|Erettopterus grandis]]'' (closely related to ''Jaekelopterus'') and ''[[Hibbertopterus|Hibbertopterus wittebergensis]]'', but ''E. grandis'' is very fragmentary and the ''H. wittenbergensis'' size estimate is based on trackway evidence, not fossil remains.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Braddy|2009|pp=|p=|loc=[http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/suppl/2009/10/09/rsbl.2009.0700.DC1/rsbl20090700supp1.xls  Supplementary information]}}\n\nThe family of ''Jaekelopterus'', the Pterygotidae, is noted for several unusually large species. Both ''[[Acutiramus]]'', whose largest member ''A. bohemicus'' measured {{convert|2.1|m|ft|sp=us}}, and ''[[Pterygotus]],'' whose largest species ''P. grandidentatus'' measured {{convert|1.75|m|ft|sp=us}}, were gigantic.{{sfn|Braddy|Poschmann|Tetlie|pp=|p=107|2008}} Several different contributing factors to the large size of the pterygotids have been suggested, including courtship behaviour, predation and competition over environmental resources.{{sfn|Briggs|1985|pp=157\u2013158}}\n\nGiant eurypterids were not limited to the family Pterygotidae. An isolated {{convert|12.7|cm|in|sp=us}} long fossil metastoma of the carcinosomatoid eurypterid ''[[Carcinosoma|Carcinosoma punctatum]]'' indicates the animal would have reached a length of {{convert|2.2|m|ft|sp=us}} in life, rivalling the pterygotids in size.{{sfn|Kjellesvig-Waering|1961|pp=|p=830}} Another giant was ''[[Pentecopterus|Pentecopterus decorahensis]]'', a primitive carcinosomatoid, which is estimated to have reached lengths of {{convert|1.7|m|ft|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Briggs|Liu|pp=|5=2015|p=15|Witzke}}\n\nTypical of large eurypterids is a lightweight build. Factors such as locomotion, energy costs in [[molting]] and respiration, as well as the actual physical properties of the [[exoskeleton]], limits the size that arthropods can reach. A lightweight construction significantly decreases the influence of these factors. Pterygotids were particularly lightweight, with most fossilized large body segments preserving as thin and unmineralized.{{sfn|Braddy|Poschmann|Tetlie|pp=|p=107|2008}} Lightweight adaptations are present in other giant paleozoic arthropods as well, such as the giant millipede ''[[Arthropleura]]'', and are possibly vital for the evolution of giant size in arthropods.{{sfn|Braddy|Poschmann|Tetlie|pp=|p=107|2008}}{{sfn|Kraus|Brauckmann|2003|pp=5\u201350|p=}}\n\nIn addition to the lightweight giant eurypterids, some deep-bodied forms in the family Hibbertopteridae were also very large. A carapace from the Carboniferous of Scotland referred to the species ''Hibbertoperus scouleri'' measures {{cvt|65|cm}} wide. As ''Hibbertopterus'' was very wide compared to its length, the animal in question could possibly have measured just short of {{convert|2|m|ft|sp=us}} in length. More robust than the pterygotids, this giant ''Hibbertopterus'' would possibly have rivalled the largest pterygotids in weight, if not surpassed them, and as such be among the heaviest arthropods.{{sfn|Tetlie|2008|p=19}}\n\n===Locomotion===\n{{Multiple images|align=right|direction=vertical|width=220|image1=Subaqueous flight.png|caption1=Illustration of subaqueous flight in ''[[Eurypterus]]'' in which the shape of the paddles and their motion through water is enough to generate [[Lift (force)|lift]].

In contrast, a number of stylonurines had elongated and powerful legs that might have allowed them to walk on land (similar to modern [[crab]]s).{{sfn|Palaeos||p=}}\n\nA [[fossil trackway]] was discovered in Carboniferous-aged fossil deposits of Scotland in 2005 It was attributed to the stylonurine eurypterid ''Hibbertopterus'' due to a matching size (the trackmaker was estimated to have been about {{convert|1.6|m|ft|sp=us}} long) and inferred leg anatomy. It is the largest terrestrial trackway\u2014measuring {{convert|6|m|ft|sp=us}} long and averaging {{convert|95|cm|ft|sp=us}} in width\u2014made by an arthropod found thus far. It is the first record of land locomotion by a eurypterid. The trackway provides evidence that some eurypterids could survive in terrestrial environments, at least for short periods of time, and reveals information about the stylonurine gait. In ''Hibbertopterus'', as in most eurypterids, the pairs of appendages are different in size (referred to as a heteropodous limb condition). These differently sized pairs would have moved in phase, and the short stride length indicates that ''Hibbertopterus'' crawled with an exceptionally slow speed, at least on land. The large telson was dragged along the ground and left a large central groove behind the animal. Slopes in the tracks at random intervals suggest that the motion was jerky.{{sfn|Whyte|2005|p=576}} The gait of smaller stylonurines, such as ''[[Parastylonurus]]'', was probably faster and more precise.{{sfn|Selden|1999|p=43|pp=}}\n\nThe functionality of the eurypterine swimming paddles varied from group to group. In the [[Eurypteroidea]], the paddles were similar in shape to oars. The condition of the joints in their appendages ensured their paddles could only be moved in near-horizontal planes, not upwards or downwards. Some other groups, such as the Pterygotioidea, would not have possessed this condition and were probably able to swim faster.{{sfn|Selden|1999|p=45}} Most eurypterines are generally agreed to have utilized a rowing type of propulsion similar to that of crabs and [[water beetle]]s. Larger individuals may have been capable of underwater flying (or [[Aquatic locomotion|subaqueous flight]]) in which the motion and shape of the paddles are enough to generate [[Lift (force)|lift]], similar to the swimming of [[sea turtle]]s and [[sea lion]]s. This type of movement has a relatively slower acceleration rate than the rowing type, especially since adults have proportionally smaller paddles than juveniles. However, since the larger sizes of adults mean a higher [[drag coefficient]], using this type of propulsion is more energy-efficient.{{sfn|Selden|1999|p=|pp=44\u201346}}\n[[File:Palmichnium kosinskiorum (eurypterid tracks).jpg|thumb|The [[holotype]] of ''[[Palmichnium|Palmichnium kosinkiorum]]'', containing the largest eurypterid footprints known.]]\nSome eurypterines, such as ''[[Mixopterus]]'' (as inferred from attributed fossil trackways), were not necessarily good swimmers. It likely kept mostly to the bottom, using its swimming paddles for occasional bursts of movements vertically, with the fourth and fifth pairs of appendages positioned backwards to produce minor movement forwards. While walking, it probably used a gait like that of most modern insects. The weight of its long abdomen would have been balanced by two heavy and specialized frontal appendages, and the [[center of gravity]] might have been adjustable by raising and positioning the tail.{{sfn|Hanken|St\u00f8rmer|p=|pp=262\u2013267|1975}}\n\nPreserved fossilized eurypterid trackways tend to be large and heteropodous and often have an associated telson drag mark along the mid-line (as with the Scottish ''Hibbertopterus'' track). Such trackways have been discovered on every continent except for South America. In some places where eurypterid fossil remains are otherwise rare, such as in [[South Africa]] and the rest of the former supercontinent [[Gondwana]], the discoveries of trackways both predate and outnumber eurypterid body fossils.{{sfn|Braddy|Almond|p=166|pp=|1999}} Eurypterid trackways have been referred to several ichnogenera, most notably ''[[Palmichnium]]'' (defined as a series of four tracks often with an associated drag mark in the mid-line),{{sfn|Braddy|Almond|p=|pp=168\u2013170|1999}} wherein the holotype of the ichnospecies ''P. kosinkiorum'' preserves the largest eurypterid footprints known to date with the found tracks each being about {{convert|7.6|cm|in|sp=us}} in diameter.{{sfn|Brezinski|Kollar|p=39|pp=|2016}} Other eurypterid ichnogenera include ''[[Merostomichnites]]'' (though it is likely that many specimens actually represent trackways of crustaceans) and ''[[Arcuites]]'' (which preserves grooves made by the swimming appendages).{{sfn|Braddy|Almond|p=|pp=168\u2013170|1999}}{{sfn|Hanken|St\u00f8rmer|p=255|pp=|1975}}{{sfn|Vrazo|Ciurca|p=235|pp=|2017}}\n\n===Respiration===\n[[File:Oniscus asellus - male side 2 (aka).jpg|left|thumb|The supposed \"gill tracts\" of eurypterids have been compared to the air-breathing [[Pseudotrachea|pseudotrachae]] present in the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] legs of modern [[Isopoda|isopods]], such as ''[[Oniscus]]'' (pictured).]]\nIn eurypterids, the respiratory organs were located on the ventral body wall (the underside of the opisthosoma). ''Blatf\u00fcsse'', evolved from opisthosomal appendages, covered the underside and created a gill chamber where the ''kiemenplatten'' (gill tracts) were located.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}} Depending on the species, the eurypterid gill tract was either triangular or oval in shape and was possibly raised into a cushion-like state. The surface of this gill tract bore several [[spinule]]s (small spines), which resulted in an enlarged surface area. It was composed of spongy tissue due to many [[invagination]]s in the structure.{{sfn|Selden|1985|p=219|pp=}}\n\nThough the ''kiemenplatte'' is referred to as a \"gill tract\", it may not necessarily have functioned as actual gills. In other animals, gills are used for oxygen uptake from water and are outgrowths of the body wall. Despite eurypterids clearly being primarily aquatic animals that almost certainly evolved underwater (some eurypterids, such as the pterygotids, would even have been physically unable to walk on land), it is unlikely the gill tract contained functional gills when comparing the organ to gills in other invertebrates and even fish. Previous interpretations often identified the eurypterid \"gills\" as homologous with those of other groups (hence the terminology), with gas exchange occurring within the spongy tract and a pattern of branchio-cardiac and dendritic veins (as in related groups) carrying oxygenated blood into the body. The primary analogy used in previous studies has been horseshoe crabs, though their gill structure and that of eurypterids are remarkably different. In horseshoe crabs, the gills are more complex and composed of many lamellae (plates) which give a larger surface area used for gas exchange. In addition, the gill tract of eurypterids is proportionally much too small to support them if it is analogous to the gills of other groups. To be functional gills, they would have to have been highly efficient and would have required a highly efficient circulatory system. It is considered unlikely, however, that these factors would be enough to explain the large discrepancy between gill tract size and body size.{{sfn|Selden|1985|p=|pp=220\u2013221}}\n\nIt has been suggested instead that the \"gill tract\" was an organ for breathing air, perhaps actually being a [[lung]], [[Plastron (arthropod)|plastron]] or a [[pseudotrachea]].{{sfn|Selden|1985|p=221|pp=}} Plastrons are organs that some arthropods evolved secondarily to breathe air underwater. This is considered an unlikely explanation since eurypterids had evolved in water from the start and they  would not have organs evolved from air-breathing organs present. In addition, plastrons are generally exposed on outer parts of the body while the eurypterid gill tract is located behind the ''blatf\u00fcssen''.{{sfn|Selden|1985|p=222|pp=}} Instead, among arthropod respiratory organs, the eurypterid gill tracts most closely resemble the pseudotrachae found in modern [[Isopoda|isopods]]. These organs, called pseudotrachae, because of some resemblance to the [[Trachea|trachae]] (windpipes) of air-breathing organisms, are lung-like and present within the [[pleopods]] (back legs) of isopods. The structure of the pseudotrachae has been compared to the spongy structure of the eurypterid gill tracts. It is possible the two organs functioned in the same way.{{sfn|Selden|1985|p=|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nSome researchers have suggested that eurypterids may have been adapted to an amphibious lifestyle, using the full gill tract structure as gills and the invaginations within it as pseudotrachea. This mode of life may not have been physiologically possible, however, since water pressure would have forced water into the invaginations leading to [[asphyxiation]]. Furthermore, most eurypterids would have been aquatic their entire lives. No matter how much time was spent on land, organs for respiration in underwater environments must have been present. True gills, expected to have been located within the branchial chamber within the ''blatf\u00fcssen'', remain unknown in eurypterids.{{sfn|Selden|1985|p=|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\n===Ontogeny===\n[[File:Strobilopterus proteus juveniles.jpg|thumb|[[Larva]]l (left) and juvenile (right) [[instar]]s of ''[[Strobilopterus]]'' (not to scale)]]\nLike all arthropods, eurypterids matured and grew through static developmental stages referred to as [[instar]]s. These instars were punctuated by periods during which eurypterids went through [[ecdysis]] (molting of the cuticle) after which they underwent rapid and immediate growth. Some arthropods, such as insects and many crustaceans, undergo extreme changes over the course of maturing. Chelicerates, including eurypterids, are in general considered to be direct developers, undergoing no extreme changes after hatching (though extra body segments and extra limbs may be gained over the course of [[ontogeny]] in some lineages, such as [[xiphosura]]ns and [[sea spider]]s). Whether eurypterids were true direct developers (with hatchlings more or less being identical to adults) or hemianamorphic direct developers (with extra segments and limbs potentially being added during ontogeny) has been controversial in the past.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Selden|p=32|pp=|2013}}\n\nHemianamorphic direct development has been observed in many arthropod groups, such as [[trilobite]]s, [[megacheira]]ns, basal [[crustacean]]s and basal [[Myriapoda|myriapods]]. True direct development has on occasion been referred to as a trait unique to [[arachnid]]s. There have been few studies on eurypterid ontogeny as there is a general lack of specimens in the fossil record that can confidently be stated to represent juveniles.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Selden|p=32|pp=|2013}} It is possible that many eurypterid species thought to be distinct actually represent juvenile specimens of other species, with paleontologists rarely considering the influence of ontogeny when describing new species.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Selden|p=33|pp=|2013}}\n\nStudies on a well-preserved fossil assemblage of eurypterids from the [[Pragian]]-aged [[Beartooth Butte Formation]] in [[Cottonwood Canyon (Wyoming)|Cottonwood Canyon]], [[Wyoming]], composed of multiple specimens of various developmental stages of eurypterids ''Jaekelopterus'' and ''[[Strobilopterus]]'', revealed that eurypterid ontogeny was more or less parallel and similar to that of extinct and extant xiphosurans, with the largest exception being that eurypterids hatched with a full set of appendages and opisthosomal segments. Eurypterids were thus not hemianamorphic direct developers, but true direct developers like modern arachnids.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Selden|p=44|pp=|2013}}\n\nThe most frequently observed change occurring through ontogeny (except for some genera, such as ''Eurypterus'', which appear to have been static) is the metastoma becoming proportionally less wide. This ontogenetic change has been observed in members of several superfamilies, such as the Eurypteroidea, the Pterygotioidea and the [[Moselopteroidea]].{{sfn|Lamsdell|Selden|p=34|pp=|2013}}\n\n===Feeding===\n[[File:Pterygotus abelov.jpg|thumb|''[[Pterygotus]]'' depicted hunting ''[[Birkenia]]''.]]\nNo fossil gut contents from eurypterids are known so direct evidence of their diet is lacking. The eurypterid biology is particularly suggestive of a carnivorous lifestyle. Not only were many large (in general, most predators tend to be larger than their prey), but they had [[stereoscopic vision]] (the ability to perceive depth).{{sfn|Selden|1999|p=46|pp=\u2013}} The legs of many eurypterids were covered in thin spines, used both for locomotion and the gathering of food. In some groups, these spiny appendages became heavily specialized. In some eurypterids in the Carcinosomatoidea, forward-facing appendages were large and possessed enormously elongated spines (as in ''Mixopterus'' and ''[[Megalograptus]]''). In [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|derived]] members of the Pterygotioidea, the appendages were completely without spines, but had specialized claws instead.{{sfn|Selden|1999|p=47|pp=}} Other eurypterids, lacking these specialized appendages, likely fed in a manner similar to modern horseshoe crabs, by grabbing and shredding food with their appendages before pushing it into their mouth using their chelicerae.{{sfn|Hembree|Platt|Smith|pp=|p=77|2014}}\n\nFossils preserving [[digestive tracts]] have been reported from fossils of various eurypterids, among them ''Carcinosoma'', ''Acutiramus'' and ''[[Eurypterus]]''. Though a potential anal opening has been reported from the telson of a specimen of ''[[Buffalopterus]]'', it is more likely that the [[anus]] was opened through the thin cuticle between the last segment before the telson and the telson itself, as in modern horseshoe crabs.{{sfn|Selden|1999|p=46|pp=\u2013}}\n\nEurypterid coprolites discovered in deposits of Ordovician age in Ohio containing fragments of a trilobite and eurypterid ''Megalograptus ohioensis'' in association with full specimens of the same eurypterid species have been suggested to represent evidence of [[cannibalism]].

The seventh segment (thus the first opisthosomal segment) is referred to as the ''metastoma'' and the eighth segment (distinctly plate-like) is called the ''operculum'' and contains the genital aperature. The underside of this segment is occupied by the genital operculum, a structure originally evolved from ancestral seventh and eighth pair of appendages. In its center, as in modern horseshoe crabs, is a genital appendage. This appendage, an elongated rod with an internal duct, is found in two distinct morphs, generally referred to as \"type A\" and \"type B\".{{sfn|Palaeos||p=}} These genital appendages are often preserved prominently in fossils and have been the subject of various  interpretations of eurypterid reproduction and sexual dimorphism.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=|p=436}}\n\nType A appendages are generally longer than those of type B. In some genera they are divided into different numbers of sections, such as in ''Eurypterus'' where the type A appendage is divided into three but the type B appendage into only two.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=|p=438}} Such division of the genital appendage is common in eurypterids, but the number is not universal; for instance, the appendages of both types in the family Pterygotidae are undivided.{{sfn|Braddy|Poschmann|Tetlie|pp=|p=108|2008}} The type A appendage is also armed with two curved spines called ''furca'' ([[Latin]] for \"fork\"). The presence of ''furca'' in the type B appendage is also possible and the structure may represent the unfused tips of the appendages. Located between the [[Dorsal (anatomy)|dorsal]] and ventral surfaces of the ''blatfuss'' associated with the type A appendages is a set of organs traditionally described as either \"tubular organs\" or \"horn organs\". These organs are most often interpreted as [[spermatheca]]e (organs for storing [[sperm]]), though this function is yet to be proven conclusively.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=|p=439}} In arthropods, spermathecae are used to store the [[spermatophore]] received from males. This would imply that the type A appendage is the female morph and the type B appendage is the male.{{sfn|Palaeos||p=}} Further evidence for the type A appendages representing the female morph of genital appendages comes in their more complex construction (a general trend for female arthropod genitalia). It is possible that the greater length of the type A appendage means that it was used as an [[ovipositor]] (used to deposit eggs).{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=|p=449}} The different types of genital appendages are not necessarily the only feature that distinguishes between the sexes of eurypterids. Depending on the genus and species in question, other features such as size, the amount of ornamentation and the proportional width of the body can be the result of sexual dimorphism.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=437\u2013439}} In general, eurypterids with type B appendages (males) appear to have been proportionally wider than eurypterids with type A appendages (females) of the same genera.{{sfn|Lamsdell|2014|p=|pp=175\u2013177}}\n\nThe primary function of the long, assumed female, type A appendages was likely to take up spermatophore from the substrate into the [[reproductive tract]] rather than to serve as an ovipositor, as arthropod ovipositors are generally longer than eurypterid type A appendages. By rotating the sides of the operculum, it would have been possible to lower the appendage from the body. Due to the way different plates overlay at its location, the appendage would have been impossible to move without muscular contractions moving around the operculum. It would have been kept in place when not it use. The ''furca'' on the type A appendages may have aided in breaking open the spermatophore to release the free sperm inside for uptake. The \"horn organs,\" possibly spermathecae, are thought to have been connected directly to the appendage via tracts, but these supposed tracts remain unpreserved in available fossil material.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=450\u2013452|p=}}\n\nType B appendages, assumed male, would have produced, stored and perhaps shaped spermatophore in a heart-shaped structure on the dorsal surface of the appendage. A broad genital opening would have allowed large amounts of spermatophore to be released at once. The long ''furca'' associated with type B appendages, perhaps capable of being lowered like the type A appendage, could have been used to detect whether a substrate was suitable for spermatophore deposition.{{sfn|Braddy|Dunlop|1997|pp=454\u2013455|p=}}\n\n==Evolutionary history==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Eurypterids Pentecopterus Vertical.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of ''[[Pentecopterus]]'', the earliest known eurypterid.

The presence of members of both suborders indicates that primitive stem-eurypterids would have preceded them, though these are so far unknown in the fossil record.

Only two families of eurypterines survived into the Late Devonian at all ([[Adelophthalmidae]] and Waeringopteridae). The eurypterines experienced their most major declines in the Early Devonian, during which over 50% of their diversity was lost in just 10 million years. Stylonurines, on the other hand, persisted through the period with more or less consistent diversity and abundance but were affected during the Late Devonian, when many of the older groups were replaced by new forms in the families Mycteroptidae and Hibbertopteridae.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Braddy|2009|pp=|p=265}}\n\nIt is possible that the catastrophic extinction patterns seen in the eurypterine suborder were related to the emergence of more derived fish.

He considered the trilobites to be crustaceans, as previous authors had, and classified them together with what he assumed to be their closest relatives, ''Eurypterus'' and the genus ''[[Cytherina]]'', within a clade he named \"Palaeadae\". Within Palaeadae, Burmeister erected three families; the \"Trilobitae\" (composed of all trilobites), the \"Cytherinidae\" (composed only of ''Cytherina'', an animal today seen as an [[ostracod]]) and the [[Eurypteridae]] (composed of ''Eurypterus'', then including three species).{{sfn|Burmeister|1843|p=|pp=62\u201364}}\n\nThe fourth eurypterid genus to be described (following ''Hibbertopterus'' in 1836 and ''Campylocephalus'' in 1838, not identified as eurypterids until later), out of those still seen as [[Valid name (zoology)|taxonomically valid]] in modern times, was ''Pterygotus'', described by [[Louis Agassiz]] in 1839.{{sfn|Dunlop|Penney|pp=|p=27|Jekel|2018}} ''Pterygotus'' was considerably larger in size than ''Eurypterus'' and when the first fossils were discovered by quarrymen in [[Scotland]] they were referred to as \"[[Seraph]]ims\" by the workers.

These publications were the first to fully describe the whole anatomy of eurypterids, recognizing the full number of prosomal appendages and the number of preabdominal and postabdominal segments.

He focused on how the eurypterids related to each other and to trilobites, crustaceans, scorpions, other arachnids and horseshoe crabs. The description of ''Eurypterus fischeri'' by Gerhard Holm in 1896 was so elaborate that the species became one of the most completely known of all extinct animals, so much so that the knowledge of ''E. fischeri'' was comparable with the knowledge of its modern relatives (such as the [[Atlantic horseshoe crab]]). The description also helped solidify the close relationship between the eurypterids and other chelicerates by showcasing numerous [[homologies]] between the two groups.{{sfn|Clarke|Ruedemann|1912|p=19|pp=}}\n\nIn 1912, [[John Mason Clarke]] and [[Rudolf Ruedemann]] published ''The Eurypterida of New York'' in which all eurypterid species thus far recovered from fossil deposits there were discussed.

Several homologies encourage this view, such as correlating segments of the appendages and the prosoma. Additionally, the presence of plate-like appendages bearing the \"gill tracts\" on appendages of the opisthosoma (the ''blatf\u00fcssen'') was cited early as an important homology. In the last few decades of the nineteenth century, further homologies were established, such as the similar structures of the compound eyes of ''Pterygotus'' and horseshoe crabs (seen as especially decisive as the eye of the horseshoe crab was seen as possessing an almost unique structure) and similarities in the ontogeny within both groups.{{sfn|Clarke|Ruedemann|1912|p=135|pp=}} These ontogenetical similarities were seen as most apparent when studying the [[nepionic stage]]s (the developmental stage immediately following the embryonic stage) in both groups, during which both xiphosurans and eurypterids have a proportionally larger carapace than adults, are generally broader, possess a distinct ridge down the middle, have a lesser number of segments which lack differentiation and have an underdeveloped telson.{{sfn|Clarke|Ruedemann|1912|p=136|pp=}}\n\nDue to these similarities, the xiphosurans and eurypterids have often been united under a single class or [[Subclass (biology)|subclass]] called Merostomata (erected to house both groups by Henry Woodward in 1866). Though xiphosurans (like the eurypterids) were historically seen as crustaceans due to their respiratory system and their aquatic lifestyle, this hypothesis was discredited after numerous similarities were discovered between the horseshoe crabs and the arachnids.{{sfn|Clarke|Ruedemann|1912|p=136|pp=}} Some authors, such as [[John Sterling Kingsley]] in 1894, classified the Merostomata as a sister group to the Arachnida under the class \"Acerata\" within a subphylum \"Branchiata\". Others, such as [[Ray Lankester]] in 1909, went further and classified the Merostomata as a subclass within the Arachnida, raised to the rank of class.{{sfn|Clarke|Ruedemann|1912|p=137|pp=}}\n\nIn 1866, [[Ernst Haeckel]] classified the Merostomata (containing virtually only the Eurypterida) and Xiphosura within a group he named Gigantostraca within the crustaceans.

General leg anatomy can also be used to define superfamilies and families. Historically, the chelicerae were considered the most important appendages from a taxonomical standpoint since they only occurred in two general types: a eurypterid type with small and toothless pincers and a pterygotid type with large pincers and teeth. This distinction has historically been used to divide the Eurypterida into the two suborders Eurypterina (small chelicerae) and \"Pterygotina\" (large and powerful chelicerae).{{sfn|Tollerton|1989|p=646|pp=}} This classification scheme is not without problems. In Victor Tollerton's 1989 taxonomic revision of the Eurypterida, with suborders Eurypterina and Pterygotina recognized, several clades of eurypterids today recognized as stylonurines (including hibbertopterids and mycteroptids) were reclassified as non-eurypterids in the new separate order \"Cyrtoctenida\" on the grounds of perceived inconsistencies in the prosomal appendages.{{sfn|Tollerton|1989|p=650|pp=}}\n\nModern research favors a classification into suborders Eurypterina and Stylonurina instead, supported by phylogenetic analyses.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Briggs|Liu|pp=|5=2015|p=25|Witzke}}{{sfn|Lamsdell|Selden|2013|p=34|pp=}} In particular, pterygotid eurypterids share a number of homologies with derived eurypterine eurypterids such as the adelophthalmids, and are thus best classified as derived members of the same suborder.{{sfn|Tetlie|Cuggy|2007|pp=|p=350}} In the Stylonurina, the sixth pair of appendages is represented by long and slender walking legs and lack a modified spine (referred to as the podomere 7a). In most eurypterids in the Eurypterina, the sixth pair of appendages is broadened into swimming paddles and always has a podomere 7a. 75% of eurypterid species are eurypterines and they represent 99% of all fossil eurypterid specimens.{{sfn|Tetlie|2007|pp=|p=559}} Of all eurypterid clades, the Pterygotioidea is the most species-rich, with over 50 species. The second most species-rich clade is the Adelophthalmoidea, with over 40 species.{{sfn|Tetlie|2007|pp=|p=570}}\n\nThe cladogram presented below, covering all currently recognized eurypterid families, follows a 2007 study by O. Erik Tetlie.{{sfn|Tetlie|2007|pp=|p=565}} The stylonurine suborder follows a 2010 study by James Lamsdell, Simon J. Braddy and Tetlie.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Braddy|Tetlie|pp=|p=56|2010}} The superfamily \"Megalograptoidea\", recognized by Tetlie in 2007 and then placed between the [[Onychopterelloidea]] and Eurypteroidea, has been omitted as more recent studies suggest that the megalograptids were members of the superfamily Carcinosomatoidea. As such, the phylogeny of the Carcinosomatoidea follows a 2015 study by Lamsdell and colleagues.{{sfn|Lamsdell|Briggs|Liu|pp=|5=2015|p=3|Witzke}}\n\n{{clade|{{clade\n |label1=[[Stylonurina]]\n |1={{clade\n  | 1= [[Rhenopteridae]] [[File:Brachyopterus restoration.png|50px]]\n  | 2={{clade\n   |label1=[[Stylonuroidea]]\n   | 1={{clade\n    | 1= [[Parastylonuridae]]\n    | 2= [[Stylonuridae]] [[File:Stylonurus BW white background.png|45px]]\n}}\n   | 2={{clade\n    |label1=[[Kokomopteroidea]]\n    | 1={{clade\n     | 1= [[Hardieopteridae]]\n     | 2= [[Kokomopteridae]]\n}}\n    |label2= [[Mycteropoidea]] \n    | 2={{clade\n     | 1= [[Drepanopteridae]]\n     | 2={{clade\n      | 1= [[Hibbertopteridae]] [[File:Hibbertopterus scouleri.jpg|60px]]\n      | 2= [[Mycteroptidae]] [[File:Megarachne BW.jpg|55px]]\n}} }} }} }} }}\n |label2=[[Eurypterina]]\n |2={{clade\n  | 1= [[Moselopteridae]] [[File:Stoermeropterus.png|55px]]\n  | 2={{clade\n   | 1= [[Onychopterellidae]]\n   | 2={{clade\n    |label1= [[Eurypteroidea]] \n    | 1={{clade\n     | 1= [[Dolichopteridae]]\n     | 2={{clade\n      | 1= [[Eurypteridae]] [[File:Eurypterus Paleoart (no background).png|55px]]\n      | 2= [[Strobilopteridae]]\n}} }}\n    |label2=[[Diploperculata]]\n    | 2={{clade\n     |label1= [[Carcinosomatoidea]] \n     | 1={{clade\n      | 1= [[Megalograptidae]] \n      | 2={{clade\n       | 1= [[Carcinosomatidae]] [[File:Carcinosoma newlini.png|55px]]\n       | 2= [[Mixopteridae]] [[File:Mixopterus BW.jpg|60px]]\n}} }}\n     | 2={{clade\n      | 1= [[Waeringopteridae]]\n      | 2={{clade\n       | 1= [[Adelophthalmidae]] [[File:Adelophthalmus irinae.png|40px]]\n       |label2= [[Pterygotioidea]] \n       | 2={{clade\n        | 1= [[Hughmilleriidae]]\n        | 2={{clade\n         | 1= [[Pterygotidae]] [[File:Pterygotus anglicus reconstruction.jpg|60px]]\n         | 2= [[Slimonidae]] [[File:Slimonia acuminata reconstruction.jpg|60px]]\n}} }} }} }} }} }} }} }} }}|label1='''Eurypterida'''}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arthropods|Palaeontology}}\n* [[List of eurypterid genera]]\n* [[Nepidae]]\u2014an unrelated family of insects, commonly known as \"water scorpions\".\n* [[Cottidae]]\u2014family of fishes in which some members contain \"sea scorpion\" in their common name.\n* [[Evolutionary history of life]]\n\n== References ==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n*{{Cite book|title=Evolution|last=Bergstrom|first=Carl T.|publisher=Norton|year=2012|isbn=978-0393913415|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFBergstromDugatkin2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SeaEZwEACAAJ|last2=Dugatkin|first2=Lee Alan}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Braddy|first=Simon J.|last2=Dunlop|first2=Jason A.|date=1997|title=The functional morphology of mating in the Silurian eurypterid, ''Baltoeurypterus tetragonophthalmus'' (Fischer, 1839)|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=120|issue=4|pages=435\u2013461|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1997.tb01282.x|issn=0024-4082|ref=CITEREFBraddyDunlop1997}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Braddy|first=Simon J.|last2=Almond|first2=John E.|date=1999|title=Eurypterid trackways from the Table Mountain Group (Ordovician) of South Africa|journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences|volume=29|issue=1|pages=165\u2013177|doi=10.1016/S0899-5362(99)00087-1|issn=|ref=CITEREFBraddyAlmond1999|bibcode=1999JAfES..29..165B}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Braddy|first=Simon J.|last2=Poschmann|first2=Markus|date=2008|title=Giant claw reveals the largest ever arthropod|journal=Biology Letters|volume=4|issue=1|pages=106\u2013109|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0491|ref=CITEREFBraddyPoschmannTetlie2008|first3=O.

She is considered to be a central figure in one of the great art movements of the century.  Throughout her career, Noskowiak photographed quite a few subjects those including landscapes, still lives and portraits. Her most well-known, and unacknowledged, portraits are of the author, John Steinbeck. In 1936, Noskowiak was awarded a prize at the annual exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artist. She was also represented in the San Francisco Museum of Art\u2019s 1939 \u201cScenes from San Francisco\u201d exhibit. Ten years before her death, Noskowiak's work was included in a WPA exhibition at the Oakland Museum, in Oakland, California.\n\n\n\n==Life==\n===Early Life===\nNoskowiak was born in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]]. Her father was a landscape gardener who instilled in her an awareness of the land that would later become evident in her photography.<ref name=\"Darsie2002\">{{cite book|author=Darsie Alexander|title=Original Sources: Art and Archives at the Center for Creative Photography|publisher=Center for Creative Photography|year=2002|pages=149}}</ref> In her early years, she moved around the world while her father sought work in Chile, then Panama, before finally settling in Los Angeles, California in 1915.

Upon expressing her interest in photography Hagemeyer, wrote off dream as a joke in his diary. \n\n===Becoming a Photographer===\nIn early April 1929, Noskowiak met photographer [[Edward Weston]] at a party and the two began dating immediately; her eventually becoming his model, muse, pupil, and assistant. Weston first taught her to spot photos--touching up flaws in prints--before he giving her first professional camera. This camera included no film and for several months Noskowiak worked with Weston pretending to photograph while he taught her the mechanics of photography. During her time with Weston Noskowiak's photography developed tremendously showcasing her understanding of craftsmanship, as well as her own style. Several of Weston's works, such as Red Cabbage Halved and Artichoke Halved, were inspired by Noskowiak's early negatives. Weston even once stated: \"Any of these I would sign as my own.\" Dora Hagemeyer (sister-in-law of Johan) wrote that while Noskowiak's photographic style was clean and direct like Weston's, she \"put into her work something which is essentially her own: a subtle and delicate loveliness.\"<ref name=\"Hagemeyer1933\">{{cite journal|first=Dora|last=Hagemeyer|date=8 September 1933|title=Noskowiak Exhibit Important to Art|journal=Carmel Pine Cone|page=4}}</ref>\n==Photography==\n===Group F.64===\nPhotography in the late 1800s and early 1900s was defined by [[pictorialism]], a style that refers to a photographer manipulating an otherwise straightforward photograph in the means of 'creating'.

When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles, or ''virions'', consisting of: (i) the [[genetic material]], i.e. long [[molecule]]s of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; (ii) a [[protein]] coat, the ''[[capsid]]'', which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an outside [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[lipid]]s. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an [[optical microscope]] as they are one hundredth the size of most bacteria.\n\nThe origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s\u2014pieces of DNA that can move between cells\u2014while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]] in a way analogous to [[sexual reproduction]].<ref name=\"Canchaya\" /> Viruses are considered by some [[biologist]]s to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through [[natural selection]], although they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\",<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal| vauthors = Rybicki EP |year = 1990|title = The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics|journal = South African Journal of Science |volume = 86|pages = 182\u201386}}</ref> and as [[Self-replication|replicators]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Starokadomskyy P | title = Are viruses alive?

One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on [[plant sap]], such as [[aphid]]s; and viruses in animals can be carried by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], passed by contact and entering the body in food or water. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses transmitted through [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexual contact]] and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its \"[[Host specificity|host range]]\". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many.<ref>Shors pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nViral infections in animals provoke an [[immune response]] that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause AIDS, [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV infection]], and [[viral hepatitis]], evade these immune responses and result in [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections. Several [[antiviral drug]]s have been developed.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word is from the Latin neuter {{lang|la|v\u012brus}} referring to [[poison]] and other noxious liquids, from the same [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European base]] as [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa|vi\u1e63a}}, [[Avestan]] {{lang|ae|v\u012b\u0161a}}, and [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f30\u03cc\u03c2}} (all meaning \"poison\"), first [[Attested language|attested]] in English in 1398 in [[John Trevisa|John Trevisa's]] translation of [[Bartholomeus Anglicus|Bartholomeus Anglicus's]] ''De Proprietatibus Rerum''.<ref>{{cite dictionary | chapter = Virus, n. | title = OED Online | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = March 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"Etymology_Dictionary\">{{cite web | title=virus | vauthors = Harper D |year=2011 | work = The Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virus|access-date=19 December 2014}}</ref> ''Virulent'', from Latin ''virulentus'' (poisonous), dates to c. 1400.<ref>{{cite dictionary | chapter = Virulent, adj. | title = OED Online | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = March 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web \n|title=virulent | vauthors = Harper D |year=2011 | work = The Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virulent |access-date=19 December 2014}}</ref> A meaning of \"agent that causes infectious disease\" is first recorded in 1728,<ref name=\"Etymology_Dictionary\" /> long before the discovery of viruses by [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] in 1892.

This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions which can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.<ref>Collier p. 37</ref>\n\n; Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. A [[regular icosahedron]] is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number of identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called [[Hexon protein|hexons]].<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref> Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved.

The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented.

Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle.

Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation.

Some viruses undergo a [[lysogenic cycle]] where the viral genome is incorporated by [[genetic recombination]] into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a \"[[provirus]]\" or, in the case of bacteriophages a \"[[prophage]]\".<ref>Shors pp. 60, 597</ref> Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host. At some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to active virus, which may lyse the host cells.<ref>Dimmock, Chapter 15, ''Mechanisms in virus latentcy'', pp. 243\u201359</ref> Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by [[viral shedding|budding]].

If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell either by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or\u2014more usually\u2014by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. Viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.<ref>Shors p. 54; Collier p. 78</ref>\n\n; RNA viruses: Replication of [[RNA virus]]es usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>\n\n; Reverse transcribing viruses: [[Reverse transcribing viruses]] have ssRNA (''[[Retroviridae]]'', ''[[Metaviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'') or dsDNA (''[[Caulimoviridae]]'', and ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'') in their particles.

As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution.

When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles, or ''virions'', consisting of: (i) the [[genetic material]], i.e. long [[molecule]]s of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; (ii) a [[protein]] coat, the ''[[capsid]]'', which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an outside [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[lipid]]s.

One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on [[plant sap]], such as [[aphid]]s; and viruses in animals can be carried by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], passed by contact and entering the body in food or water. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses transmitted through [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexual contact]] and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its \"[[Host specificity|host range]]\". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many.<ref>Shors pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nViral infections in animals provoke an [[immune response]] that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause AIDS, [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV infection]], and [[viral hepatitis]], evade these immune responses and result in [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections.

This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions which can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.<ref>Collier p. 37</ref>\n\n; Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. A [[regular icosahedron]] is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number of identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called [[Hexon protein|hexons]].<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref> Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved.

The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. All segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by [[brome mosaic virus]] and several other plant viruses.<ref name=\"Collier3355\" />\n\nA viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is almost always either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" />\n\nFor most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA genomes, the single strands are said to be either [[positive-sense]] (called the 'plus-strand') or [[negative-sense]] (called the 'minus-strand'), depending on if they are complementary to the viral [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that positive-strand viral ssDNA is identical in sequence to the viral mRNA and is thus a coding strand, while negative-strand viral ssDNA is complementary to the viral mRNA and is thus a template strand.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" /> Several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are [[ambisense]] in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate.

This specificity determines the host range and type of host cell of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human [[leucocytes]]. This is because its surface protein, [[gp120]], specifically interacts with the [[CD4]] molecule\u2014a [[chemokine receptor]]\u2014which is most commonly found on the surface of [[CD4+]] [[T-Cells]]. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that result in the [[Lipid bilayer fusion|fusion]] of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.<ref name=\"pmid23737062\">{{cite journal | vauthors = M\u00e1s V, Melero JA | title = Entry of enveloped viruses into host cells: membrane fusion | journal = Sub-Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 68 | issue =  | pages = 467\u201387 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23737062 | doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_16 | isbn = 978-94-007-6551-1 | series = Subcellular Biochemistry }}</ref>\n\n''[[Viral entry|Penetration]]'' follows attachment: Virions enter the host cell through receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]] or [[Lipid bilayer fusion|membrane fusion]] in a process often known as [[viral entry]]. The infection of plant and fungal cells is different from that of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of [[cellulose]], and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall.<ref>Dimmock p. 70</ref> Nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called [[plasmodesma]]ta.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boevink P, Oparka KJ | title = Virus-host interactions during movement processes | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 138 | issue = 4 | pages = 1815\u201321 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16172094 | pmc = 1183373 | doi = 10.1104/pp.105.066761 }}</ref> Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell.

Some viruses undergo a [[lysogenic cycle]] where the viral genome is incorporated by [[genetic recombination]] into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a \"[[provirus]]\" or, in the case of bacteriophages a \"[[prophage]]\".<ref>Shors pp. 60, 597</ref> Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host. At some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to active virus, which may lyse the host cells.<ref>Dimmock, Chapter 15, ''Mechanisms in virus latentcy'', pp. 243\u201359</ref> Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by [[viral shedding|budding]]. During this process the virus acquires its envelope, which is a modified piece of the host's plasma or other, internal membrane.<ref>Dimmock 185\u201387</ref>\n\n=== Genome replication ===\nThe genetic material within virus particles, and the method by which the material is replicated, varies considerably between different types of viruses.\n\n; DNA viruses: The genome replication of most [[DNA virus]]es takes place in the cell's [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell either by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or\u2014more usually\u2014by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. Viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.<ref>Shors p. 54; Collier p. 78</ref>\n\n; RNA viruses: Replication of [[RNA virus]]es usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>\n\n; Reverse transcribing viruses: [[Reverse transcribing viruses]] have ssRNA (''[[Retroviridae]]'', ''[[Metaviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'') or dsDNA (''[[Caulimoviridae]]'', and ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'') in their particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes ([[retrovirus]]es) use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes ([[dsDNA-RT virus|pararetrovirus]]es) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a [[reverse transcriptase]], or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by [[reverse transcription]] into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus.<ref name=\"pmid16949329\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Staginnus C, Richert-P\u00f6ggeler KR | title = Endogenous pararetroviruses: two-faced travelers in the plant genome | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 485\u201391 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16949329 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2006.08.008 }}</ref> They are susceptible to [[antiviral drug]]s that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. [[zidovudine]] and [[lamivudine]].

Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between [[human herpesvirus 6]] (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].<ref name=\"PMID_17276367\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Komaroff AL | title = Is human herpesvirus-6 a trigger for chronic fatigue syndrome? | journal = Journal of Clinical Virology | volume = 37 Suppl 1 | pages = S39\u201346 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17276367 | doi = 10.1016/S1386-6532(06)70010-5 }}</ref> There is controversy over whether the [[bornavirus]], previously thought to cause [[neurology|neurological]] diseases in horses, could be responsible for [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] illnesses in humans.<ref name=\"Chen_1999\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen CH, Chiu YL, Wei FC, Koong FJ, Liu HC, Shaw CK, Hwu HG, Hsiao KJ | display-authors = 6 | title = High seroprevalence of Borna virus infection in schizophrenic patients, family members and mental health workers in Taiwan | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 33\u201338 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 10089006 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4000484 }}</ref>\n\nViruses have different mechanisms by which they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species.

The terms \"national deficit\" and \"national surplus\" usually refer to the federal [[government budget balance]] from year to year, not the cumulative amount of debt.

One measure of the debt burden is its size relative to GDP, called the \"[[debt-to-GDP ratio]].\" Mathematically, this is the debt divided by the GDP amount. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] includes historical budget and debt tables along with its annual \"Budget and Economic Outlook.\" Debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP rose from 34.7% GDP in 2000 to 40.5% in 2008 and 67.7% in 2011.<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42905 CBO \u2013 The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022 \u2013 See Historical Budget Data Supplement], Cbo.gov, January 2012.</ref>\n\nMathematically, the ratio can decrease even while debt grows if the rate of increase in GDP (which also takes account of inflation) is higher than the rate of increase of debt. Conversely, the debt to GDP ratio can increase even while debt is being reduced, if the decline in GDP is sufficient.\n\nAccording to the ''CIA World Factbook'', during 2015, the U.S. debt to GDP ratio of 73.6% was the 39th highest in the world.

Also, this number excludes state and local debt. According to the OECD, general government gross debt (federal, state, and local) in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $22.5 trillion (125% of GDP); subtracting out $5.25 trillion for intragovernmental federal debt to count only federal \"debt held by the public\" gives 96% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web|author=OECD |url=http://stats.oecd.org/ |title=OECD Statistics |website=Stats.oecd.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref>\n\nThe ratio is higher if the total national debt is used, by adding the \"intragovernmental debt\" to the \"debt held by the public.\" For example, on April 29, 2016, debt held by the public was approximately $13.84 trillion or about 76% of GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5.35 trillion, giving a combined total public debt of $19.19 trillion.

However, there is complexity in the budgetary computations that can make the deficit figure commonly reported in the media (the \"total deficit\") considerably different from the annual increase in the debt.

The total federal deficit is the sum of the on-budget deficit (or surplus) and the off-budget deficit (or surplus). Since FY1960, the federal government has run on-budget deficits except for FY1999 and FY2000, and total federal deficits except in FY1969 and FY1998\u2013FY2001.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z1.xls Table 1.1 \u2013 Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-): 1789\u20132017] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706102517/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z1.xls |date=July 6, 2012 }}, Whitehouse.gov; accessed August 24, 2016.</ref>\n\nFor example, in January 2009 the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] reported that for fiscal year 2008 (FY2008) the \"on-budget deficit\" was $638 billion, offset by an \"off-budget surplus\" (mainly due to Social Security revenue in excess of payouts) of $183 billion, for a \"total deficit\" of $455 billion. This latter figure is the one commonly reported in the media. However, an additional $313 billion was required for \"the Treasury actions aimed at stabilizing the financial markets,\" an unusually high amount due to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].  This meant that the \"debt held by the public\" increased by $768 billion ($455B + $313B = $768B). The \"off-budget surplus\" was borrowed and spent (as is typically the case), increasing the \"intra-governmental debt\" by $183 billion. So the total increase in the \"National debt\" in FY2008 was $768B +$183B = $951 billion.<ref name=CBO_2009>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41753|title=CBO Budget and Economic Outlook 2009\u20132019|website=CBO|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}</ref> The Treasury Department reported an increase in the National Debt of $1,017B for FY2008.<ref name=TreasuryDirect_2008>{{cite web|url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo5.htm|title=TreasuryDirect Historical Debt Outstanding|website=Treasury Direct|accessdate=November 26, 2016}}</ref> The $66 billion difference is likely due to \"supplemental appropriations\" for the War on Terror, some of which were outside the budget process entirely until President Obama began including most of them in his FY2010 budget.<ref name=Politifact_Suppl>{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/161/end-the-abuse-of-supplemental-budgets-for-war/|title=Money in budgets, but supplementals aren't going away|website=Politifact|accessdate=November 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn other words, spending the \"off budget\" Social Security surplus adds to the total national debt (by increasing the intragovernmental debt) while the \"off-budget\" surplus reduces the \"total\" deficit reported in the media.

The June 2017 forecast was essentially the budget trajectory inherited from President Obama; it was prepared prior to the Tax Act and spending increases under President Trump.\n* For the 2018\u20132027 period, CBO projects the sum of the annual deficits (i.e., debt increase) to be $11.7 trillion, an increase of $1.6 trillion (16%) over the previous baseline (June 2017) forecast of $10.1 trillion.\n* The $1.6 trillion debt increase includes three main elements: 1) $1.7 trillion less in revenues due to the tax cuts; 2) $1.0 trillion more in spending; and 3) Partially offsetting incremental revenue of $1.1 trillion due to higher economic growth than previously forecast.\n* [[United States national debt|Debt held by the public]] is expected (Congressional Budget Office Outlook) to rise from 78% of GDP ($16 trillion) at the end of 2018 to 96% GDP ($29 trillion) by 2028.

By contrast, if Social Security benefits were limited to the amounts payable from revenues received by the Social Security trust funds, debt in 2049 would reach 106 percent of GDP, still well above its current level.</blockquote>\n\nOver the long-term, the CBO projects that interest expense and mandatory spending categories (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) will continue to grow relative to GDP, while discretionary categories (e.g., Defense and other Cabinet Departments) continue to fall relative to GDP.

The federal debt at the end of the 2018/19 fiscal year (ended September 30, 2019) was $22.7 trillion. The portion that is held by the public was $16.8 trillion.

The CBO analyzes net interest as a percentage of GDP, with a higher percentage indicating a higher interest payment burden. During 2015, this was 1.3% GDP, close to the record low 1.2% of the 1966\u20131968 era.

By contrast, intragovernmental debt (the other component of the gross debt) has no such effects because it is simply money the federal government owes (and pays interest on) to itself.\"<ref name=\"cbpp.org\"/>\n\nHowever, if the U.S. government continues to run \"on budget\" deficits as projected by the CBO and OMB for the foreseeable future, it will have to issue marketable Treasury bills and bonds (i.e., debt held by the public) to pay for the projected shortfall in the Social Security program.

But our sin involves investing too little, not borrowing too much.\" Young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result.

About 16 million persons filed for unemployment insurance in the three weeks ending April 9. It caused the number of unemployed persons to increase significantly, which is expected to reduce tax revenues while increasing [[automatic stabilizer]] spending for [[unemployment insurance]] and [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|nutritional support]]. As a result of the adverse economic impact, both state and federal budget deficits will dramatically increase, even before considering any new legislation.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/economy/unemployment-claim-numbers-coronavirus.html NYT-Sudden Black Hole for the Economy with Millions More Unemployed-April 9, 2020]</ref>\n\nTo help address lost income for millions of workers and assist businesses, Congress and President Trump enacted the [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] (CARES) on March 27, 2020. It included loans and grants for businesses, along with direct payments to individuals and additional funding for unemployment insurance. While the Act carried a estimated $2.3 trillion price tag, some or all of the loans may ultimately be paid back including interest, while the spending measures should dampen the negative budgetary impact of the economic disruption. While the law will almost certainly increase budget deficits relative to the January 2020 10-year CBO baseline (completed prior to the Coronavirus), in the absence of the legislation, a complete economic collapse could have occurred.<ref>[https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/4/8/short-run-effects-of-the-cares-act Penn Wharton Budget Model-Short Run Economic Effects of the CARES Act-April 8, 2020]</ref>  \n\nCBO provided a preliminary score for the CARES Act on April 16, 2020, estimating that it would increase federal deficits by about $1.8 trillion over the 2020-2030 period. The estimate includes: \n*A $988 billion increase in mandatory outlays; \n*A $446 billion decrease in revenues; and \n*A $326 billion increase in discretionary outlays, stemming from emergency supplemental appropriations.\n\nCBO reported that not all parts of the bill will increase deficits: \u201cAlthough the act provides financial assistance totaling more than $2 trillion, the projected cost is less than that because some of that assistance is in the form of loan guarantees, which are not estimated to have a net effect on the budget. In particular, the act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to provide up to $454 billion to fund emergency lending facilities established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

Fiscal years 1950\u20132010 GDP measurements were derived from December 2010 Bureau of Economic Analysis figures which also tend to be subject to revision, especially more recent years. Afterwards the OMB figures were revised back to 2004 and the BEA figures (in a revision dated July 31, 2013) were revised back to 1947.\n\nRegarding estimates recorded in the GDP column (the last column) marked with a \"~\" symbol, absolute differences from advance (one month after) BEA reports of GDP percent change to current findings (as of November 2013) found in revisions are stated to be 1.3% \u00b1 2.0% or a 95% probability of being within the range of 0.0\u20133.3%, assuming the differences to occur according to standard deviations from the average absolute difference of 1.3%. E.g. with an advance report of a $400&nbsp;billion increase of a $10&nbsp;trillion GDP, for example, one could be 95% confident that the range in which the exact GDP dollar amount lies would be 0.0 to 3.3% different than 4.0% (400 \u00f7 10,000) or within the range of $0 to $330&nbsp;billion different than the hypothetical $400&nbsp;billion (a range of $70\u2013730 billion). Two months after, with a revised value, the range of potential difference from the stated estimate shrinks, and three months after with another revised value the range shrinks again.\n\nFiscal years 1940\u20131970 begin July 1 of the previous year (for example, Fiscal Year 1940 begins July 1, 1939 and ends June 30, 1940); fiscal years 1980\u20132010 begin October 1 of the previous year.

The terms \"national deficit\" and \"national surplus\" usually refer to the federal [[government budget balance]] from year to year, not the cumulative amount of debt. A deficit year increases the debt, while a surplus year decreases the debt as more money is received than spent.\n\nThere are two components of gross national debt:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/debt/debtbasics.html#largefeddebt|title=Federal debt basics \u2013 How large is the federal debt? |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]]|accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref>\n* \"Debt held by the public\" \u2013 such as Treasury securities held by investors outside the federal government, including those held by individuals, corporations, the [[Federal Reserve System]], and foreign, state and local governments.\n* \"Debt held by government accounts\" or \"intragovernmental debt\" \u2013 is non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts of programs administered by the federal government, such as the [[Social Security Trust Fund]]. Debt held by government accounts represents the cumulative surpluses, including interest earnings, of various government programs that have been invested in Treasury securities.\n\nIn general, government debt increases as a result of government spending, and decreases from tax or other receipts, both of which fluctuate during the course of a fiscal year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist.pdf|title=Historical Tables \u2013 Table 1.2 \u2013 Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-) as Percentages of GDP: 1930\u20132017|publisher=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|accessdate=April 16, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417053737/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist.pdf|archivedate=April 17, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the US public debt as a share of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) has increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined.

For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 35 years.

One measure of the debt burden is its size relative to GDP, called the \"[[debt-to-GDP ratio]].\" Mathematically, this is the debt divided by the GDP amount. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] includes historical budget and debt tables along with its annual \"Budget and Economic Outlook.\" Debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP rose from 34.7% GDP in 2000 to 40.5% in 2008 and 67.7% in 2011.<ref>[http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42905 CBO \u2013 The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022 \u2013 See Historical Budget Data Supplement], Cbo.gov, January 2012.</ref>\n\nMathematically, the ratio can decrease even while debt grows if the rate of increase in GDP (which also takes account of inflation) is higher than the rate of increase of debt. Conversely, the debt to GDP ratio can increase even while debt is being reduced, if the decline in GDP is sufficient.\n\nAccording to the ''CIA World Factbook'', during 2015, the U.S. debt to GDP ratio of 73.6% was the 39th highest in the world. This was measured using \"debt held by the public.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html|title=The World Factbook |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref> However, $1 trillion in additional borrowing since the end of FY 2015 has raised the ratio to 76.2% as of April 2016 [See Appendix#National debt for selected years]. Also, this number excludes state and local debt. According to the OECD, general government gross debt (federal, state, and local) in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $22.5 trillion (125% of GDP); subtracting out $5.25 trillion for intragovernmental federal debt to count only federal \"debt held by the public\" gives 96% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web|author=OECD |url=http://stats.oecd.org/ |title=OECD Statistics |website=Stats.oecd.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}</ref>\n\nThe ratio is higher if the total national debt is used, by adding the \"intragovernmental debt\" to the \"debt held by the public.\" For example, on April 29, 2016, debt held by the public was approximately $13.84 trillion or about 76% of GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5.35 trillion, giving a combined total public debt of $19.19 trillion. U.S. GDP for the previous 12 months was approximately $18.15 trillion, for a total debt to GDP ratio of approximately 106%.<ref>Multiple references:\n* [http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np Debt to the Penny (Daily History Search Application)]\n* [http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass_roundup/2012/09/us-national-debt.html US national debt surpasses $16 trillion] \u2013 Boston Business Journal\n* United States Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (December 2010).

However, there is complexity in the budgetary computations that can make the deficit figure commonly reported in the media (the \"total deficit\") considerably different from the annual increase in the debt. The major categories of differences are the treatment of the Social Security program, Treasury borrowing, and supplemental appropriations outside the budget process.<ref name=CBO_2009/>\n\nSocial Security payroll taxes and benefit payments, along with the net balance of the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]], are considered \"off-budget\", while most other expenditure and receipt categories are considered \"on-budget\". The total federal deficit is the sum of the on-budget deficit (or surplus) and the off-budget deficit (or surplus). Since FY1960, the federal government has run on-budget deficits except for FY1999 and FY2000, and total federal deficits except in FY1969 and FY1998\u2013FY2001.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z1.xls Table 1.1 \u2013 Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits (-): 1789\u20132017] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706102517/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z1.xls |date=July 6, 2012 }}, Whitehouse.gov; accessed August 24, 2016.</ref>\n\nFor example, in January 2009 the [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] reported that for fiscal year 2008 (FY2008) the \"on-budget deficit\" was $638 billion, offset by an \"off-budget surplus\" (mainly due to Social Security revenue in excess of payouts) of $183 billion, for a \"total deficit\" of $455 billion. This latter figure is the one commonly reported in the media. However, an additional $313 billion was required for \"the Treasury actions aimed at stabilizing the financial markets,\" an unusually high amount due to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].  This meant that the \"debt held by the public\" increased by $768 billion ($455B + $313B = $768B). The \"off-budget surplus\" was borrowed and spent (as is typically the case), increasing the \"intra-governmental debt\" by $183 billion. So the total increase in the \"National debt\" in FY2008 was $768B +$183B = $951 billion.<ref name=CBO_2009>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/41753|title=CBO Budget and Economic Outlook 2009\u20132019|website=CBO|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}</ref> The Treasury Department reported an increase in the National Debt of $1,017B for FY2008.<ref name=TreasuryDirect_2008>{{cite web|url=https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo5.htm|title=TreasuryDirect Historical Debt Outstanding|website=Treasury Direct|accessdate=November 26, 2016}}</ref> The $66 billion difference is likely due to \"supplemental appropriations\" for the War on Terror, some of which were outside the budget process entirely until President Obama began including most of them in his FY2010 budget.<ref name=Politifact_Suppl>{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/161/end-the-abuse-of-supplemental-budgets-for-war/|title=Money in budgets, but supplementals aren't going away|website=Politifact|accessdate=November 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn other words, spending the \"off budget\" Social Security surplus adds to the total national debt (by increasing the intragovernmental debt) while the \"off-budget\" surplus reduces the \"total\" deficit reported in the media.

Funding for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was accounted for this way prior to the Obama administration.<ref name=Politifact_Suppl/> Certain stimulus measures and [[earmark (politics)|earmarks]] were also outside the budget process.

Maintaining current policies for example would include extending the individual Trump tax cuts past their scheduled expiration in 2025, among other changes.\n* The debt increase of $1.6 trillion represents approximately $12,700 per household (assuming 126.2 million households in 2017), while the $3.6 trillion represents $28,500 per household.<ref name=\"CBO_BOE2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53651|title=The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028 \u2013 Congressional Budget Office|website=www.cbo.gov}}</ref>\n\n===CBO long-term outlook===\n[[File:Federal debt held by public CBO 2019.png|thumb|right|350px|The actual and projected United States Federal Debt Held by the Public as percentage of GDP.]]\n[[File:CBO 2014 LTBO Spending Under Ext Baseline.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Spending for mandatory programs is projected to rise relative to GDP, while discretionary programs decline]]\nThe CBO reports its ''Long-Term Budget Outlook'' annually, providing at least two scenarios for spending, revenue, deficits, and debt. The 2019 Outlook mainly covers the 30-year period through 2049. The CBO reported:\n\n<blockquote>Large budget deficits over the next 30 years are projected to drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levels\u2014from 78 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 to 144 percent by 2049. That projection incorporates CBO\u2019s central estimates of various factors, such as productivity growth and interest rates on federal debt. CBO\u2019s analysis indicates that even if values for those factors differed from the agency\u2019s projections, debt several decades from now would probably be much higher than it is today.<ref name=cbo2019LTO>[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55331 CBO The 2019 Long-Term Budget Outlook], cbo.gov; accessed June 25, 2019.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFurthermore, under alternative scenarios:\n<blockquote>If lawmakers changed current laws to maintain certain major policies now in place\u2014most significantly, if they prevented a cut in discretionary spending in 2020 and an increase in individual income taxes in 2026\u2014then debt held by the public would increase even more, reaching 219 percent of GDP by 2049. By contrast, if Social Security benefits were limited to the amounts payable from revenues received by the Social Security trust funds, debt in 2049 would reach 106 percent of GDP, still well above its current level.</blockquote>\n\nOver the long-term, the CBO projects that interest expense and mandatory spending categories (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) will continue to grow relative to GDP, while discretionary categories (e.g., Defense and other Cabinet Departments) continue to fall relative to GDP. Debt is projected to continue rising relative to GDP under the above two scenarios, although the CBO did also offer other scenarios that involved austerity measures that would bring the debt to GDP ratio down.<ref name=cbo2019LTO/>\n\n==Risks and debates==\n[[File:Historical and projected US Federal Government revenues and spending 2018 GAO financial report.png|thumb|Historical and projected US Federal Government revenues and spending from 2018 GAO financial report]]\n{{See also|Political debates about the United States federal budget|Deficit reduction in the United States}}\n\n===CBO risk factors===\nThe CBO reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt levels in a July 2010 publication:\n* A growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of government debt, rather than investments in productive capital goods such as factories and computers, leading to lower output and incomes than would otherwise occur;\n* If higher marginal tax rates were used to pay rising interest costs, savings would be reduced and work would be discouraged;\n* Rising interest costs would force reductions in government programs;\n* Restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to respond to economic challenges; and\n* An increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis, in which investors demand higher interest rates.<ref name=\"Huntley, Jonathan 2010\">Huntley, Jonathan (July 27, 2010).

While the Act carried a estimated $2.3 trillion price tag, some or all of the loans may ultimately be paid back including interest, while the spending measures should dampen the negative budgetary impact of the economic disruption.

The estimate includes: \n*A $988 billion increase in mandatory outlays; \n*A $446 billion decrease in revenues; and \n*A $326 billion increase in discretionary outlays, stemming from emergency supplemental appropriations.\n\nCBO reported that not all parts of the bill will increase deficits: \u201cAlthough the act provides financial assistance totaling more than $2 trillion, the projected cost is less than that because some of that assistance is in the form of loan guarantees, which are not estimated to have a net effect on the budget. In particular, the act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to provide up to $454 billion to fund emergency lending facilities established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Because the income and costs stemming from that lending are expected to roughly offset each other, CBO estimates no deficit effect from that provision.\u201d<ref name=\"CBO_Score1\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56334|title=H.R. 748, CARES Act, Public Law 116-136 |date=April 16, 2020 |work=cbo.gov |access-date=April 16, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget]] estimated that the budget deficit for fiscal year 2020 would increase to a record $3.8 trillion, or 18.7% GDP.<ref name = \"CRFB_CARES1\">[https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/04/13/us/13reuters-health-coronavirus-usa-budget.html?

Fiscal years 1950\u20132010 GDP measurements were derived from December 2010 Bureau of Economic Analysis figures which also tend to be subject to revision, especially more recent years. Afterwards the OMB figures were revised back to 2004 and the BEA figures (in a revision dated July 31, 2013) were revised back to 1947.\n\nRegarding estimates recorded in the GDP column (the last column) marked with a \"~\" symbol, absolute differences from advance (one month after) BEA reports of GDP percent change to current findings (as of November 2013) found in revisions are stated to be 1.3% \u00b1 2.0% or a 95% probability of being within the range of 0.0\u20133.3%, assuming the differences to occur according to standard deviations from the average absolute difference of 1.3%. E.g. with an advance report of a $400&nbsp;billion increase of a $10&nbsp;trillion GDP, for example, one could be 95% confident that the range in which the exact GDP dollar amount lies would be 0.0 to 3.3% different than 4.0% (400 \u00f7 10,000) or within the range of $0 to $330&nbsp;billion different than the hypothetical $400&nbsp;billion (a range of $70\u2013730 billion). Two months after, with a revised value, the range of potential difference from the stated estimate shrinks, and three months after with another revised value the range shrinks again.\n\nFiscal years 1940\u20131970 begin July 1 of the previous year (for example, Fiscal Year 1940 begins July 1, 1939 and ends June 30, 1940); fiscal years 1980\u20132010 begin October 1 of the previous year.

The figures for this table were corrected the next week with changes to figures in those fiscal years.\n\nOn July 30, 2015, the BEA released a revision to 2012\u20132015 GDP figures.  The figures for this table were corrected on that day with changes to FY 2013 and 2014, but not 2015 as FY 2015 is updated within a week with the release of debt totals for July 31, 2015.\n\nOn June 25, 2014, the BEA announced a 15-year revision of GDP figures would take place on July 31, 2014. The figures for this table were corrected after that date with changes to FY 2000, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The more precise FY 1999\u20132014 debt figures are derived from Treasury audit results. The variations in the 1990s and FY 2015 figures are due to double-sourced or relatively preliminary GDP figures respectively. A comprehensive [http://bea.gov/national/pdf/2013briefingslides%20for%20web.pdf revision] GDP revision dated July 31, 2013 was described on the Bureau of Economic Analysis website. In November 2013 the total debt and yearly debt as a percentage of GDP columns of this table were changed to reflect those revised GDP figures.</small>\n\n===Historical debt ceiling levels===\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n! colspan=4 | Table of historical debt ceiling levels<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/hist07z3.xls|title=Table 7.1 \u2013 Federal Debt at the End of Year: 1940\u20132016|work=Historical Tables|publisher=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|accessdate=May 16, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516133122/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/hist07z3.xls|archivedate=May 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n|-\n!

When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles, or ''virions'', consisting of: (i) the [[genetic material]], i.e. long [[molecule]]s of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; (ii) a [[protein]] coat, the ''[[capsid]]'', which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an outside [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[lipid]]s. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an [[optical microscope]] as they are one hundredth the size of most bacteria.\n\nThe origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s\u2014pieces of DNA that can move between cells\u2014while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]] in a way analogous to [[sexual reproduction]].<ref name=\"Canchaya\" /> Viruses are considered by some [[biologist]]s to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through [[natural selection]], although they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\",<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal| vauthors = Rybicki EP |year = 1990|title = The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics|journal = South African Journal of Science |volume = 86|pages = 182\u201386}}</ref> and as [[Self-replication|replicators]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Starokadomskyy P | title = Are viruses alive?

One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on [[plant sap]], such as [[aphid]]s; and viruses in animals can be carried by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], passed by contact and entering the body in food or water. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses transmitted through [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexual contact]] and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its \"[[Host specificity|host range]]\". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many.<ref>Shors pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nViral infections in animals provoke an [[immune response]] that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause AIDS, [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV infection]], and [[viral hepatitis]], evade these immune responses and result in [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections. Several [[antiviral drug]]s have been developed.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word is from the Latin neuter {{lang|la|v\u012brus}} referring to [[poison]] and other noxious liquids, from the same [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European base]] as [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa|vi\u1e63a}}, [[Avestan]] {{lang|ae|v\u012b\u0161a}}, and [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f30\u03cc\u03c2}} (all meaning \"poison\"), first [[Attested language|attested]] in English in 1398 in [[John Trevisa|John Trevisa's]] translation of [[Bartholomeus Anglicus|Bartholomeus Anglicus's]] ''De Proprietatibus Rerum''.<ref>{{cite dictionary | chapter = Virus, n. | title = OED Online | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = March 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"Etymology_Dictionary\">{{cite web | title=virus | vauthors = Harper D |year=2011 | work = The Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virus|access-date=19 December 2014}}</ref> ''Virulent'', from Latin ''virulentus'' (poisonous), dates to c. 1400.<ref>{{cite dictionary | chapter = Virulent, adj. | title = OED Online | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = March 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web \n|title=virulent | vauthors = Harper D |year=2011 | work = The Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virulent |access-date=19 December 2014}}</ref> A meaning of \"agent that causes infectious disease\" is first recorded in 1728,<ref name=\"Etymology_Dictionary\" /> long before the discovery of viruses by [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] in 1892.

This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions which can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.<ref>Collier p. 37</ref>\n\n; Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. A [[regular icosahedron]] is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number of identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called [[Hexon protein|hexons]].<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref> Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved.

The vast majority of viruses have RNA genomes. Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes.<ref name=\"Collier9699\">Collier pp. 96\u201399</ref>\n\nViral genomes are circular, as in the [[polyomavirus]]es, or linear, as in the [[Adenoviridae|adenoviruses]]. The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. All segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by [[brome mosaic virus]] and several other plant viruses.<ref name=\"Collier3355\" />\n\nA viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is almost always either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" />\n\nFor most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA genomes, the single strands are said to be either [[positive-sense]] (called the 'plus-strand') or [[negative-sense]] (called the 'minus-strand'), depending on if they are complementary to the viral [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that positive-strand viral ssDNA is identical in sequence to the viral mRNA and is thus a coding strand, while negative-strand viral ssDNA is complementary to the viral mRNA and is thus a template strand.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" /> Several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are [[ambisense]] in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate.

This specificity determines the host range and type of host cell of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human [[leucocytes]]. This is because its surface protein, [[gp120]], specifically interacts with the [[CD4]] molecule\u2014a [[chemokine receptor]]\u2014which is most commonly found on the surface of [[CD4+]] [[T-Cells]]. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication.

Some viruses undergo a [[lysogenic cycle]] where the viral genome is incorporated by [[genetic recombination]] into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a \"[[provirus]]\" or, in the case of bacteriophages a \"[[prophage]]\".<ref>Shors pp. 60, 597</ref> Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host. At some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to active virus, which may lyse the host cells.<ref>Dimmock, Chapter 15, ''Mechanisms in virus latentcy'', pp. 243\u201359</ref> Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by [[viral shedding|budding]].

If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell either by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or\u2014more usually\u2014by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. Viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.<ref>Shors p. 54; Collier p. 78</ref>\n\n; RNA viruses: Replication of [[RNA virus]]es usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>\n\n; Reverse transcribing viruses: [[Reverse transcribing viruses]] have ssRNA (''[[Retroviridae]]'', ''[[Metaviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'') or dsDNA (''[[Caulimoviridae]]'', and ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'') in their particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes ([[retrovirus]]es) use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes ([[dsDNA-RT virus|pararetrovirus]]es) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a [[reverse transcriptase]], or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by [[reverse transcription]] into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus.<ref name=\"pmid16949329\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Staginnus C, Richert-P\u00f6ggeler KR | title = Endogenous pararetroviruses: two-faced travelers in the plant genome | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 485\u201391 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16949329 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2006.08.008 }}</ref> They are susceptible to [[antiviral drug]]s that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. [[zidovudine]] and [[lamivudine]].

As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution.

When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles, or ''virions'', consisting of: (i) the [[genetic material]], i.e. long [[molecule]]s of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; (ii) a [[protein]] coat, the ''[[capsid]]'', which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an outside [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[lipid]]s.

One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on [[plant sap]], such as [[aphid]]s; and viruses in animals can be carried by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], passed by contact and entering the body in food or water. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses transmitted through [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexual contact]] and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its \"[[Host specificity|host range]]\". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many.<ref>Shors pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nViral infections in animals provoke an [[immune response]] that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause AIDS, [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV infection]], and [[viral hepatitis]], evade these immune responses and result in [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections.

This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions which can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.<ref>Collier p. 37</ref>\n\n; Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. A [[regular icosahedron]] is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number of identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called [[Hexon protein|hexons]].<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref> Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved.

The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. All segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by [[brome mosaic virus]] and several other plant viruses.<ref name=\"Collier3355\" />\n\nA viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is almost always either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" />\n\nFor most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA genomes, the single strands are said to be either [[positive-sense]] (called the 'plus-strand') or [[negative-sense]] (called the 'minus-strand'), depending on if they are complementary to the viral [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that positive-strand viral ssDNA is identical in sequence to the viral mRNA and is thus a coding strand, while negative-strand viral ssDNA is complementary to the viral mRNA and is thus a template strand.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" /> Several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are [[ambisense]] in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate.

This specificity determines the host range and type of host cell of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human [[leucocytes]]. This is because its surface protein, [[gp120]], specifically interacts with the [[CD4]] molecule\u2014a [[chemokine receptor]]\u2014which is most commonly found on the surface of [[CD4+]] [[T-Cells]]. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that result in the [[Lipid bilayer fusion|fusion]] of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.<ref name=\"pmid23737062\">{{cite journal | vauthors = M\u00e1s V, Melero JA | title = Entry of enveloped viruses into host cells: membrane fusion | journal = Sub-Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 68 | issue =  | pages = 467\u201387 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23737062 | doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_16 | isbn = 978-94-007-6551-1 | series = Subcellular Biochemistry }}</ref>\n\n''[[Viral entry|Penetration]]'' follows attachment: Virions enter the host cell through receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]] or [[Lipid bilayer fusion|membrane fusion]] in a process often known as [[viral entry]]. The infection of plant and fungal cells is different from that of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of [[cellulose]], and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall.<ref>Dimmock p. 70</ref> Nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called [[plasmodesma]]ta.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boevink P, Oparka KJ | title = Virus-host interactions during movement processes | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 138 | issue = 4 | pages = 1815\u201321 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16172094 | pmc = 1183373 | doi = 10.1104/pp.105.066761 }}</ref> Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell.

Some viruses undergo a [[lysogenic cycle]] where the viral genome is incorporated by [[genetic recombination]] into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a \"[[provirus]]\" or, in the case of bacteriophages a \"[[prophage]]\".<ref>Shors pp. 60, 597</ref> Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host. At some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to active virus, which may lyse the host cells.<ref>Dimmock, Chapter 15, ''Mechanisms in virus latentcy'', pp. 243\u201359</ref> Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by [[viral shedding|budding]]. During this process the virus acquires its envelope, which is a modified piece of the host's plasma or other, internal membrane.<ref>Dimmock 185\u201387</ref>\n\n=== Genome replication ===\nThe genetic material within virus particles, and the method by which the material is replicated, varies considerably between different types of viruses.\n\n; DNA viruses: The genome replication of most [[DNA virus]]es takes place in the cell's [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell either by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or\u2014more usually\u2014by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. Viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.<ref>Shors p. 54; Collier p. 78</ref>\n\n; RNA viruses: Replication of [[RNA virus]]es usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>\n\n; Reverse transcribing viruses: [[Reverse transcribing viruses]] have ssRNA (''[[Retroviridae]]'', ''[[Metaviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'') or dsDNA (''[[Caulimoviridae]]'', and ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'') in their particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes ([[retrovirus]]es) use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes ([[dsDNA-RT virus|pararetrovirus]]es) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a [[reverse transcriptase]], or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by [[reverse transcription]] into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus.<ref name=\"pmid16949329\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Staginnus C, Richert-P\u00f6ggeler KR | title = Endogenous pararetroviruses: two-faced travelers in the plant genome | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 485\u201391 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16949329 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2006.08.008 }}</ref> They are susceptible to [[antiviral drug]]s that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. [[zidovudine]] and [[lamivudine]].

Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between [[human herpesvirus 6]] (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].<ref name=\"PMID_17276367\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Komaroff AL | title = Is human herpesvirus-6 a trigger for chronic fatigue syndrome? | journal = Journal of Clinical Virology | volume = 37 Suppl 1 | pages = S39\u201346 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17276367 | doi = 10.1016/S1386-6532(06)70010-5 }}</ref> There is controversy over whether the [[bornavirus]], previously thought to cause [[neurology|neurological]] diseases in horses, could be responsible for [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] illnesses in humans.<ref name=\"Chen_1999\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen CH, Chiu YL, Wei FC, Koong FJ, Liu HC, Shaw CK, Hwu HG, Hsiao KJ | display-authors = 6 | title = High seroprevalence of Borna virus infection in schizophrenic patients, family members and mental health workers in Taiwan | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 33\u201338 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 10089006 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4000484 }}</ref>\n\nViruses have different mechanisms by which they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species.
