[[Nanotechnology]], a relatively new field of [[science]] and [[engineering]], has shown promise to have a significant impact on the energy industry. Nanotechnology is defined as any technology that contains particles with one dimension under 100 nanometers in length. For scale, a single [[virus]] particle is about 100 nanometers wide.\n\nPeople in the fields of science and engineering have already begun developing ways of utilizing nanotechnology for the development of [[consumer]] products.  Benefits already observed from the design of these products are an increased efficiency of [[lighting]] and [[heating]], increased electrical storage capacity, and a decrease in the amount of [[pollution]] from the use of energy.  Benefits such as these make the investment of [[capital (economics)|capital]] in the [[research and development]] of nanotechnology a top priority.\n\n== Nanomaterials in Energy ==\nAccording to Dr. Wade Adams from Rice University, energy will be the most pressing problem facing humanity in the next 50 years and nanotechnology has potential to solve this issue.<ref>{{Citation|title=TEDxHouston 2011 - Wade Adams - Nanotechnology and Energy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GFst2IQBEM|language=en|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref>\n\nAn important sub-field of nanotechnology related to energy is [[nanofabrication]], the process of designing and creating devices on the nanoscale. The ability to create devices smaller than 100 nanometers opens many doors for the development of new ways to capture, store, and transfer energy.  Improvements in the precision of nanofabrication technologies are critical to solving many energy related problems that the world is currently facing.<ref name=\"Marshall 2018 p.70\">{{Cite book|last=Marshall|first=Hazell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ePEDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=he+inherent+level+of+control+that+nanofabrication+could+give+scientists+and+engineers+would+be+critical+in+providing+the+capability+of+solving+many+of+the+problems+that+the+world+is+facing+today+related+to+the+current+generation+of+energy+technologies.&source=bl&ots=2NKteAu6BA&sig=ACfU3U2qLWbpJXvXeA9RLGClyumuk2D25A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiVi7a9q4zpAhVIITQIHXkQDN4Q6AEwAHoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=he%20inherent%20level%20of%20control%20that%20nanofabrication%20could%20give%20scientists%20and%20engineers%20would%20be%20critical%20in%20providing%20the%20capability%20of%20solving%20many%20of%20the%20problems%20that%20the%20world%20is%20facing%20today%20related%20to%20the%20current%20generation%20of%20energy%20technologies.&f=false|title=Environmental Nanotechnology|date=2018-11-21|publisher=Scientific e-Resources|isbn=978-1-83947-357-9|language=en |page=70}}</ref>\n\n=== Graphene-based Materials ===\nThere is enormous interest in the use of graphene-based materials for energy storage.

They utilize silicon nanoparticles in order to absorb a greater range of [[wavelength]]s from the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This can be done by putting many identical and equally spaced silicon rods on the surface. Also, the height and length of spacing have to be optimized for reaching the best results. This arrangement of silicon particles allows solar energy to be reabsorbed by many different particles, exciting electrons and resulting in much of the energy being converted to heat. Researchers from Kyoto University have shown that these nano-scale semiconductors can increase efficiency by at least 40%, compared to the regular solar cells.<ref>{{Citation|title=How Nanotechnology is boosting Solar energy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2vvTPc30fE|language=en|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Nanocellulose\u2010based Material ===\n[[Cellulose]] is the most abundant natural [[polymer]] on earth.

That means 2D nanomaterials can be easily modified and engineered on [[Nanostructure|nanostructures]]. 2D nanomaterials have a special structural feature which is interlayer space. Interlayer space provides a unique engineering option toward tuning their [[energy storage]] and catalytic properties. The interlayer space can also be manipulated for nonlayered materials and it can be called 2D nanofluidic channels. Also, 2D nanomaterials can be engineered into porous structures, then it can be used in energy stroage and catalytic applications by applying\u00a0facile charge and mass transport. <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Yue|last2=Peng|first2=Lele|last3=Fang|first3=Zhiwei|last4=Yan|first4=Chunshuang|last5=Zhang|first5=Xiao|last6=Yu|first6=Guihua|date=2018|title=Structural Engineering of 2D Nanomaterials for Energy Storage and Catalysis|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/adma.201706347|journal=Advanced Materials|language=en|volume=30|issue=15|pages=1706347|doi=10.1002/adma.201706347|via=}}</ref>\n\n2D nanomaterials also have a few challenges. First, it happens on the property modification point of view. There are some side effects, such as activity and [[structural stability]], when a 2D structure is engineered. For example, creating some [[Defect|defects]] can increase [[Active site|active sites]] for a higher catalytic performance, but side reactions also happens and it may damage the catalyst structure. Another example is that interlayer expansion can lower ion [[diffusion barrier]] on the host, but it also can potentially lower the structural stability. Then, an equilibrium point between performance and stability has to be determined. The second one is mechanism understanding point of view. The fundamental rule of designing structure is not clear. For example, [[heterostructures]] are the main structures of catalyst in interlayer space and energy storage device, but these structures may lack interpretation on the [[catalytic reaction]] or charge storage mechanisms. A deeper understanding of 2D nanomaterial design must be required, because fundamental knowledge can provide a reasonable and efficient design. Third, it comes from the practical application. There is a huge gap between lab-scale and industry-scale. The reason is 2D nanomaterials suffer from both intrinsic instability during storage and processing. For example, porous 2D nanomaterials structures have intrinsic lower packing densities and it is hard to pack them into dense films. The processes are still being developed for transferring  from lab-scale to industry-scale. <ref name=\":2\" /> \n== Applications ==\n\n=== Lithium-Sulfur\u2013based High-performance Batteries ===\nThe Li-ion battery is currently one of the most popular electrochemical energy storage systems and has been widely used in areas from portable electronics to electric vehicles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goodenough|first=John B.|last2=Kim|first2=Youngsik|date=2010-02-09|title=Challenges for Rechargeable Li Batteries\u2020|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cm901452z|journal=Chemistry of Materials|volume=22|issue=3|pages=587\u2013603|doi=10.1021/cm901452z|issn=0897-4756}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bruce|first=Peter\u2005G.|last2=Scrosati|first2=Bruno|last3=Tarascon|first3=Jean-Marie|date=2008-04-07|title=Nanomaterials for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.200702505|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=47|issue=16|pages=2930\u20132946|doi=10.1002/anie.200702505|issn=1433-7851}}</ref> However, the [[Gravimetry|gravimetric]] energy density of Li-ion batteries is limited and less than that of fossil fuels.

Nanoparticle fuel additives can also be of great use in reducing carbon emissions and increasing the efficiency of combustion fuels. Cerium oxide nanoparticles have been shown to be very good at catalyzing the decomposition of unburnt hydrocarbons and other small particle emissions due to their high surface area to volume ratio, as well as lowering the pressure within the combustion chamber of engines to increase engine efficiency and curb NO<sub>x</sub> emissions.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.azonano.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=3085|title=Nanoparticles as Fuel Additives|date=2012-09-03|website=AZoNano.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> Addition of carbon nanoparticles has also successfully increased [[Burn rate (chemistry)|burning rate]] and ignition delay in jet fuel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghamari|first=Mohsen|last2=Ratner|first2=Albert|date=2017-01-15|title=Combustion characteristics of colloidal droplets of jet fuel and carbon based nanoparticles|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236116309887|journal=Fuel|language=en|volume=188|pages=182\u2013189|doi=10.1016/j.fuel.2016.10.040|issn=0016-2361}}</ref>\n== Environmental Impact ==\nWhile nanomaterials can increase energy efficiency in several ways, a drawback of their use lies in the effect of nanoparticles on the environment. With cerium oxide nanoparticle additives in fuel, trace amounts of these toxic particles can be emitted within the exhaust. Cerium oxide additives in diesel fuel have been shown to cause lung inflammation and increased bronchial alveolar lavage fluid in rats.<ref name=\":3\" /> This is concerning, especially in areas with high road traffic, where these particles are likely to accumulate and cause adverse health effects. Naturally occurring nanoparticles created by the incomplete combustion of diesel fuels are also large contributors to toxicity of diesel fumes. More research needs to be conducted to determine whether the addition of artificial nanoparticles to fuels decreases the net amount of toxic particle emissions due to combustion.<ref name=\":3\" />\n== Economic Benefits ==\nThe relatively recent shift toward using nanotechnology with respect to the capture, transfer, and storage of energy has and will continue to have many positive economic impacts on society.  The control of materials that nanotechnology offers to scientists and engineers of consumer products is one of the most important aspects of nanotechnology.  This allows for an improved efficiency of products across the board.\n\nA major issue with current energy generation is the loss of efficiency from the generation of heat as a by-product of the process.  A common example of this is the heat generated by the [[internal combustion engine]].  The internal combustion engine loses about 64% of the energy from [[gasoline]] as heat and an improvement of this alone could have a significant economic impact.  However, improving the internal combustion engine in this respect has proven to be extremely difficult without sacrificing performance.  Improving the efficiency of [[fuel cell]]s through the use of nanotechnology appears to be more plausible by using molecularly tailored [[catalyst]]s, polymer membranes, and improved fuel storage.\n\nIn order for a fuel cell to operate, particularly of the [[hydrogen]] variant, a [[Noble metal|noble-metal]] catalyst (usually [[platinum]], which is very expensive) is needed to separate the [[electron]]s from the [[proton]]s of the hydrogen atoms.  However, catalysts of this type are extremely sensitive to [[carbon monoxide]] reactions.  In order to combat this, [[alcohol]]s or [[hydrocarbon]]s compounds are used to lower the [[carbon monoxide]] concentration in the system.  This adds an additional cost to the device.  Using nanotechnology, catalysts can be designed through nanofabrication that are much more resistant to carbon monoxide reactions, which improves the efficiency of the process and may be designed with cheaper materials to additionally lower costs.\n\nFuel cells that are currently designed for [[transportation]] need rapid start-up periods for the practicality of consumer use.  This process puts a lot of strain on the traditional polymer electrolyte membranes, which decreases the life of the membrane requiring frequent replacement.  Using nanotechnology, engineers have the ability to create a much more durable polymer membrane, which addresses this problem.  Nanoscale polymer membranes are also much more efficient in ionic [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].  This improves the efficiency of the system and decreases the time between replacements, which lowers costs.\n\nAnother problem with contemporary fuel cells is the storage of the [[fuel]].  In the case of hydrogen fuel cells, storing the hydrogen in gaseous rather than liquid form improves the efficiency by 5%.  However, the materials that we currently have available to us significantly limit fuel storage due to low stress tolerance and costs.  Scientists have come up with an answer to this by using a nanoporous [[styrene]] material (which is a relatively inexpensive material) that when super-cooled to around -196<sup>o</sup>C, naturally holds on to hydrogen atoms and when heated again releases the hydrogen for use.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Nanotechnology]]\n* [[Energy]]\n* [[Fuel Cell]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* http://www.conserv.com/\n* http://www.daisanalytic.com\n* http://www.appliednanoworks.com/\n* http://www.mphasetech.com/\n* http://www.azonano.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1123\n* http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~matti/ise2grp/energystorage_report/node9.html {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401085359/http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~matti/ise2grp/energystorage_report/node9.html |date=1 April 2007 }}\n* http://www.wifinotes.com/nanotechnology/energy-applications-of-nanotechnology.html\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Energy Applications Of Nanotechnology}}\n[[Category:Nanotechnology]]\n[[Category:Energy technology]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2011}}\n{{Nanotechnology implications}}\n\n{{main|List of nanotechnology applications}}\n\nAs the world's [[energy]] demand continues to grow, the development of more efficient and sustainable technologies for generating and storing energy is becoming increasingly important. [[Nanotechnology]], a relatively new field of [[science]] and [[engineering]], has shown promise to have a significant impact on the energy industry. Nanotechnology is defined as any technology that contains particles with one dimension under 100 nanometers in length. For scale, a single [[virus]] particle is about 100 nanometers wide.\n\nPeople in the fields of science and engineering have already begun developing ways of utilizing nanotechnology for the development of [[consumer]] products.  Benefits already observed from the design of these products are an increased efficiency of [[lighting]] and [[heating]], increased electrical storage capacity, and a decrease in the amount of [[pollution]] from the use of energy.  Benefits such as these make the investment of [[capital (economics)|capital]] in the [[research and development]] of nanotechnology a top priority.\n\n== Nanomaterials in Energy ==\nAccording to Dr. Wade Adams from Rice University, energy will be the most pressing problem facing humanity in the next 50 years and nanotechnology has potential to solve this issue.<ref>{{Citation|title=TEDxHouston 2011 - Wade Adams - Nanotechnology and Energy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GFst2IQBEM|language=en|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref>\n\nAn important sub-field of nanotechnology related to energy is [[nanofabrication]], the process of designing and creating devices on the nanoscale. The ability to create devices smaller than 100 nanometers opens many doors for the development of new ways to capture, store, and transfer energy.  Improvements in the precision of nanofabrication technologies are critical to solving many energy related problems that the world is currently facing.<ref name=\"Marshall 2018 p.70\">{{Cite book|last=Marshall|first=Hazell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ePEDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=he+inherent+level+of+control+that+nanofabrication+could+give+scientists+and+engineers+would+be+critical+in+providing+the+capability+of+solving+many+of+the+problems+that+the+world+is+facing+today+related+to+the+current+generation+of+energy+technologies.&source=bl&ots=2NKteAu6BA&sig=ACfU3U2qLWbpJXvXeA9RLGClyumuk2D25A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiVi7a9q4zpAhVIITQIHXkQDN4Q6AEwAHoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=he%20inherent%20level%20of%20control%20that%20nanofabrication%20could%20give%20scientists%20and%20engineers%20would%20be%20critical%20in%20providing%20the%20capability%20of%20solving%20many%20of%20the%20problems%20that%20the%20world%20is%20facing%20today%20related%20to%20the%20current%20generation%20of%20energy%20technologies.&f=false|title=Environmental Nanotechnology|date=2018-11-21|publisher=Scientific e-Resources|isbn=978-1-83947-357-9|language=en |page=70}}</ref>\n\n=== Graphene-based Materials ===\nThere is enormous interest in the use of graphene-based materials for energy storage.

That means 2D nanomaterials can be easily modified and engineered on [[Nanostructure|nanostructures]]. 2D nanomaterials have a special structural feature which is interlayer space. Interlayer space provides a unique engineering option toward tuning their [[energy storage]] and catalytic properties. The interlayer space can also be manipulated for nonlayered materials and it can be called 2D nanofluidic channels. Also, 2D nanomaterials can be engineered into porous structures, then it can be used in energy stroage and catalytic applications by applying\u00a0facile charge and mass transport. <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Yue|last2=Peng|first2=Lele|last3=Fang|first3=Zhiwei|last4=Yan|first4=Chunshuang|last5=Zhang|first5=Xiao|last6=Yu|first6=Guihua|date=2018|title=Structural Engineering of 2D Nanomaterials for Energy Storage and Catalysis|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/adma.201706347|journal=Advanced Materials|language=en|volume=30|issue=15|pages=1706347|doi=10.1002/adma.201706347|via=}}</ref>\n\n2D nanomaterials also have a few challenges. First, it happens on the property modification point of view. There are some side effects, such as activity and [[structural stability]], when a 2D structure is engineered. For example, creating some [[Defect|defects]] can increase [[Active site|active sites]] for a higher catalytic performance, but side reactions also happens and it may damage the catalyst structure. Another example is that interlayer expansion can lower ion [[diffusion barrier]] on the host, but it also can potentially lower the structural stability. Then, an equilibrium point between performance and stability has to be determined. The second one is mechanism understanding point of view. The fundamental rule of designing structure is not clear. For example, [[heterostructures]] are the main structures of catalyst in interlayer space and energy storage device, but these structures may lack interpretation on the [[catalytic reaction]] or charge storage mechanisms. A deeper understanding of 2D nanomaterial design must be required, because fundamental knowledge can provide a reasonable and efficient design. Third, it comes from the practical application. There is a huge gap between lab-scale and industry-scale. The reason is 2D nanomaterials suffer from both intrinsic instability during storage and processing. For example, porous 2D nanomaterials structures have intrinsic lower packing densities and it is hard to pack them into dense films. The processes are still being developed for transferring  from lab-scale to industry-scale. <ref name=\":2\" /> \n== Applications ==\n\n=== Lithium-Sulfur\u2013based High-performance Batteries ===\nThe Li-ion battery is currently one of the most popular electrochemical energy storage systems and has been widely used in areas from portable electronics to electric vehicles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goodenough|first=John B.|last2=Kim|first2=Youngsik|date=2010-02-09|title=Challenges for Rechargeable Li Batteries\u2020|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cm901452z|journal=Chemistry of Materials|volume=22|issue=3|pages=587\u2013603|doi=10.1021/cm901452z|issn=0897-4756}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bruce|first=Peter\u2005G.|last2=Scrosati|first2=Bruno|last3=Tarascon|first3=Jean-Marie|date=2008-04-07|title=Nanomaterials for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.200702505|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=47|issue=16|pages=2930\u20132946|doi=10.1002/anie.200702505|issn=1433-7851}}</ref> However, the [[Gravimetry|gravimetric]] energy density of Li-ion batteries is limited and less than that of fossil fuels.

Nanotechnology could improve combustion by designing specific catalysts with maximized surface area. In 2005, scientists at the [[University of Toronto]] developed a spray-on nanoparticle substance that, when applied to a surface, instantly transforms it into a solar collector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/01/0114_050114_solarplastic.html <!-- not at archive.org -->|title=Solar Plastic|publisher=National Geographic}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n== Environmental Impact ==\nWhile nanomaterials can increase energy efficiency in several ways, a drawback of their use lies in the effect of nanoparticles on the environment. With cerium oxide nanoparticle additives in fuel, trace amounts of these toxic particles can be emitted within the exhaust. Cerium oxide additives in diesel fuel have been shown to cause lung inflammation and increased bronchial alveolar lavage fluid in rats.<ref name=\":3\" /> This is concerning, especially in areas with high road traffic, where these particles are likely to accumulate and cause adverse health effects. Naturally occurring nanoparticles created by the incomplete combustion of diesel fuels are also large contributors to toxicity of diesel fumes. More research needs to be conducted to determine whether the addition of artificial nanoparticles to fuels decreases the net amount of toxic particle emissions due to combustion.<ref name=\":3\" />\n== Economic Benefits ==\nThe relatively recent shift toward using nanotechnology with respect to the capture, transfer, and storage of energy has and will continue to have many positive economic impacts on society.  The control of materials that nanotechnology offers to scientists and engineers of consumer products is one of the most important aspects of nanotechnology.  This allows for an improved efficiency of products across the board.\n\nA major issue with current energy generation is the loss of efficiency from the generation of heat as a by-product of the process.  A common example of this is the heat generated by the [[internal combustion engine]].  The internal combustion engine loses about 64% of the energy from [[gasoline]] as heat and an improvement of this alone could have a significant economic impact.  However, improving the internal combustion engine in this respect has proven to be extremely difficult without sacrificing performance.  Improving the efficiency of [[fuel cell]]s through the use of nanotechnology appears to be more plausible by using molecularly tailored [[catalyst]]s, polymer membranes, and improved fuel storage.\n\nIn order for a fuel cell to operate, particularly of the [[hydrogen]] variant, a [[Noble metal|noble-metal]] catalyst (usually [[platinum]], which is very expensive) is needed to separate the [[electron]]s from the [[proton]]s of the hydrogen atoms.  However, catalysts of this type are extremely sensitive to [[carbon monoxide]] reactions.  In order to combat this, [[alcohol]]s or [[hydrocarbon]]s compounds are used to lower the [[carbon monoxide]] concentration in the system.  This adds an additional cost to the device.  Using nanotechnology, catalysts can be designed through nanofabrication that are much more resistant to carbon monoxide reactions, which improves the efficiency of the process and may be designed with cheaper materials to additionally lower costs.\n\nFuel cells that are currently designed for [[transportation]] need rapid start-up periods for the practicality of consumer use.  This process puts a lot of strain on the traditional polymer electrolyte membranes, which decreases the life of the membrane requiring frequent replacement.  Using nanotechnology, engineers have the ability to create a much more durable polymer membrane, which addresses this problem.  Nanoscale polymer membranes are also much more efficient in ionic [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].  This improves the efficiency of the system and decreases the time between replacements, which lowers costs.\n\nAnother problem with contemporary fuel cells is the storage of the [[fuel]].  In the case of hydrogen fuel cells, storing the hydrogen in gaseous rather than liquid form improves the efficiency by 5%.  However, the materials that we currently have available to us significantly limit fuel storage due to low stress tolerance and costs.  Scientists have come up with an answer to this by using a nanoporous [[styrene]] material (which is a relatively inexpensive material) that when super-cooled to around -196<sup>o</sup>C, naturally holds on to hydrogen atoms and when heated again releases the hydrogen for use.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Nanotechnology]]\n* [[Energy]]\n* [[Fuel Cell]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* http://www.conserv.com/\n* http://www.daisanalytic.com\n* http://www.appliednanoworks.com/\n* http://www.mphasetech.com/\n* http://www.azonano.com/details.asp?ArticleID=1123\n* http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~matti/ise2grp/energystorage_report/node9.html {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401085359/http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~matti/ise2grp/energystorage_report/node9.html |date=1 April 2007 }}\n* http://www.wifinotes.com/nanotechnology/energy-applications-of-nanotechnology.html\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Energy Applications Of Nanotechnology}}\n[[Category:Nanotechnology]]\n[[Category:Energy technology]]\n", "name_user": "RileyMankin", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_applications_of_nanotechnology"}

He starts his Pok\u00e9mon journey with a [[Bulbasaur]] he received from [[Professor Oak]], which evolved into [[Ivysaur]] and later [[Venusaur]]. He is rivals with Professor Oak's grandson, [[List of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures characters#Blue|Blue]]. He caught a Pikachu that became his main Pokemon.\n\nIn the first arc, Red suffers his first overwhelming defeat when he fails to capture the mysterious [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]], leading him to Professor Oak for advice on becoming a better Pok\u00e9mon trainer. Professor Oak gives him a Pok\u00e9dex, and sends him on a long journey across Kanto to record all of the pok\u00e9mon, crossing paths with Blue and Green along the way. During his journey, he is entangled in many plots by the nefarious [[Team Rocket]], effectively foiling them each time. Together with Blue and Green, Red ultimately defeats Team Rocket when they tried to take control of [[Articuno]], [[Zapdos]] and [[Moltres]]. Red also defeats the Team Rocket leader [[Giovanni (Pok\u00e9mon)|Giovanni]] in a one-on-one Pok\u00e9mon battle and captures Team Rocket's ultimate weapon, the genetically created Pok\u00e9mon [[Mewtwo]]. Finally, Red participates in the Indigo Plateau Pok\u00e9mon League Tournament, overcoming his rival Blue in the final match and becoming the Pok\u00e9mon Champion.\n\nRed plays a smaller role in the ''Yellow'' saga, during which he is captured by the [[Elite Four]], a quartet of evil Pok\u00e9mon trainers, after refusing to participate in their plans. He is later rescued by Giovanni, and defeats the Elite Four alongside his allies. In the ''Gold, Silver & Crystal'' saga, he attempts to become Gym Leader of Viridian City, but injuries sustained from when he was captured by the Elite Four prevent him from doing so. After recovering from his injuries, he aids his allies in fighting the Mask of Ice (Pryce), the leader of [[Pok\u00e9mon crime syndicates#Team Rocket|Neo Team Rocket]].\n\nRed returns to a leading role in the ''FireRed and LeafGreen'' saga, where he teams up with Blue and Green to rescue Professor Oak, who has been kidnapped and taken to the Sevii Islands. While there, he encounters a newly revived Team Rocket and the Pok\u00e9mon Deoxys. After his team loses to them, Mewtwo appears to help them. The team then manage to defeat Giovanni and Deoxys and other companions but Red, along with Green, Blue, Yellow, and Silver, is turned into stone. He and his companions were eventually freed from their petrified forms in the ''Emerald'' saga.\n\nRed appears again alongside Green in Hoenn when they went there during the ''Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire'' saga and confronted Maxie and Archie. Though his Venusaur is capable of Mega Evolution, they are defeated after Groudon becomes Primal Groudon, but were saved thanks to Giovanni who took them on his airship.\n\nRed's Pok\u00e9mon include Saur (Venasaur), Poli (Poliwrath), Snor (Snorlax), Aero (Aerodactyl), Gyara (Gyarados), and Pika (Pikachu). While Red was frozen by the Elite Four, his Pika had to team up with Yellow, and while Red left for the hot springs, he again asked Yellow to take care of Pika. \nIn Japan, Red was voted by readers from the series as its most popular character in 2005 & 2011.<ref name=\"poll\">{{cite web|url=http://family.shogakukan.co.jp/kids/netkun/pokemon/official/story/0904/popular_human.html|title=Popular Human|publisher=Shogagkukan|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 12, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109062442/http://family.shogakukan.co.jp/kids/netkun/pokemon/official/story/0904/popular_human.html|archivedate=January 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n*'''Blue Oak''', known in Japan as {{nihongo4|'''Green \u014ckido'''|\u30aa\u30fc\u30ad\u30c9\u30fb\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3|\u014ckido Gur\u012bn}}<!--This is the ENGLISH-language Wikipedia, so we use the English names of the characters.--> is a Trainer who starts his journey with a [[Charmander]] and continues to train it well throughout his adventures even after it evolves into [[Charizard]]. Starting out quite cocky and aloof, Blue becomes more down-to-earth and sociable as the series progresses. He specializes in training Pok\u00e9mon, even those that are not his. He is the rival of [[#Red|Red]], though the ferocity of their rivalry has toned down as the series progresses. He is also Professor Oak's grandson, and he has a sister named Daisy.\n\nIn the first arc, Blue attempts to capture the mirage Pok\u00e9mon [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]] but backs down as soon as he realizes his opponent is far superior. Witnessing Red's attempt to catch it without hesitation sparks his resentment. He later encounters Red again in Viridian Forest, when he begins to reconsider his view of Red when he helps heal the wounded young of a [[Kangaskhan]] he has been trying to capture. Seeing each other's faults, Blue and Red become official rivals. After Red saves him when he becomes possessed by a wild [[Gastly]] in the Pok\u00e9mon Tower, Blue collaborates with him to defeat Team Rocket member Koga. When they later encounter, they accidentally swap all their Pok\u00e9mon with each other, so Blue takes the liberty of training Red's Pok\u00e9mon to their limits. The two rivals work together again, this time with [[#Blue|Blue]], when Professor Oak is kidnapped by Team Rocket, narrowly defeating Koga again as well as the captured [[Articuno]], [[Zapdos]] and [[Moltres]]. Applying everything he learned from Red, Blue faces off against Red in the final match of the Indigo Plateau Pok\u00e9mon League Tournament. Although he loses the battle, he considers Red to be a true friend and important companion.\n\nIn the ''Yellow'' saga, Blue helps train the rookie Pok\u00e9mon trainer [[#Yellow|Yellow]] during her search for Red, who had been kidnapped by the Elite Four.

He later defeats his childhood teacher, the Gym Leader [[Chuck (Pok\u00e9mon)|Chuck]], in a tournament pitting Johto Gym Leaders against the Kanto Leaders. He and the other Gym Leaders are tricked into boarding the Magnet Train while it is rigged to crash, but are rescued by Red.

She makes her debut in Volume 2, by trying to sell fake items to Red after flirting with him. As the series progressed, however, she decides to team up with the other Pallet Town trainers, Red and Blue, in order to defeat [[Sabrina (Pok\u00e9mon)|Sabrina]] of [[Team Rocket]].\n\nGreen returns later in the saga, having qualified for the Pok\u00e9mon League Tournament. She progresses through the tournament and into the semifinals, but is defeated by Professor Oak, who uses bird Pok\u00e9mon, [[Ornithophobia|as it was her phobia]]. Upon learning of her problem, Professor Oak takes pity on her, giving her the third Pok\u00e9dex and forgiving her for stealing his Squirtle.\n\nIn the ''Yellow'' Saga, set two years later, Green is a sort of \"shadow\" trainer, trailing [[Yellow (Pok\u00e9mon)|Yellow]]. She is the one who sends Yellow on a mission to find Red and disguise herself as a boy. In the third volume, it is revealed that Green had been snatched at the age of five by a [[Ho-Oh|mysterious bird Pok\u00e9mon]], which gave her a debilitating phobia of bird type Pok\u00e9mon. Green blamed the [[Elite Four]] for this disaster, carrying a grudge against the Elite Four into the ''Gold/Silver'' saga.\n\nIn the ''Gold, Silver & Crystal'' saga, Green first appears in volume 13, when she is shown at a Pok\u00e9mon Gym Leader's Tournament. It is revealed that she and [[#Silver|Silver]] were two of the Masked Children, and had escaped from the grasp of the Mask of Ice, the leader of [[Pok\u00e9mon crime syndicates#Team Rocket|Neo Team Rocket]], at a young age, while others abducted along with them remained and became the Mask of Ice's servants. Because of this, she shares a close bond with Silver and frequently treats him like a younger brother. She later helps out in the final battle against the Mask of Ice by using the three legendary birds with Red and Blue, and overcomes her bird phobia whilst protecting Silver.\n\nIn the ''FireRed and LeafGreen'' saga, Green appears while traveling to the Sevii Islands to meet her parents. However, Psychic Pok\u00e9mon [[Deoxys]] capturs her parents, causing Green to faint in shock when she is injured in the encounter with it. When she wakes, not fully recovered, she and Blue discover that Red was defeated by Deoxys, and rushes to his side after he runs away to recollect himself. She reveals to him the real reason why Professor Oak wanted Red and the others to return their Pok\u00e9dex and Green resolves to train, despite not being fully healed, to fight against Team Rocket and Deoxys.

A character exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, she has the powers to heal Pok\u00e9mon and hear their thoughts, because she was born in the Viridian Forest. She is a happy-go-lucky girl who isn't very good at Pok\u00e9mon battles as she dislikes them because she cannot bring herself to hurt Pok\u00e9mon. There have also been hints throughout the manga that she has a crush on Red.\n\nShe first appears in the final volume of the first arc, though her name is not revealed until the ''Yellow'' saga. Having lost her way in the Viridian Forest, Yellow is attacked by a wild [[Dratini]]. [[#Red|Red]] saves her and escorted her back to her hometown, Viridian City, and helps her catch her first [[Pok\u00e9mon]], a [[Rattata]]. Later, Yellow finds Red seriously injured following his battle with [[Giovanni (Pok\u00e9mon)|Giovanni]], and helps him.\n\nTwo years later, Yellow shows up at Professor Oak's lab disguised as a boy, and obtains Red's Pok\u00e9dex and pikachu. [[#Green|Green]] had sent her on a mission to rescue Red from the Kanto [[Elite Four]], because of her mysterious powers that allow her to heal and communicate with Pok\u00e9mon, which counter the same powers of Lance, the leader of the Elite Four. Yellow fights against the Elite Four while defending Pika, Red's pikachu, which had escaped from them. Despite opposition from the Kanto Leaders who are Red's friends, Yellow is supported by Professor Oak. Yellow encounters the Elite Four and meets Bill and Blaine. Yellow also trains with Blue. Yellow then joins forces with the Gym Leaders, Bill, Blue, Green, and the former members of Team Rocket. In the final battle, with the help of Giovanni, who also has the special powers, Yellow defeats Lance. She stops the Elite Four from gaining control of a mysterious, powerful, Pok\u00e9mon, later revealed to be Lugia. Her true gender is revealed at the end of Volume 6, but she puts off informing Red of it.\n\nIn the ''Gold, Silver & Crystal'' saga, Yellow travels to [[Johto]] and meets up with [[Crystal (Pok\u00e9mon)|Crystal]] while pursuing Lugia. It is revealed that Yellow was the one who woke up the three legendary beasts - [[Suicune]], [[Raikou (Pok\u00e9mon)|Raikou]], and [[Entei (Pok\u00e9mon)|Entei]] - from within the Burned Tower in [[Johto#Ecruteak City|Ecruteak]]. Yellow and Crystal are then separated by Lugia at sea.\n\nAfter the attack, Yellow and her uncle wash up on shore, where they are brought to the Pok\u00e9mon daycare center run by an elderly couple. Soon, the center is attacked by a group of [[Pok\u00e9mon crime syndicates#Team Rocket|Neo Team Rocket]] members who seem only to be interested in Yellow's hat. In truth, the two feathers on her hat are the Silver Wing from [[Lugia]] and the Rainbow Wing from [[Ho-Oh]], the keys to traveling in time, stolen from the Mask of Ice many years ago and planted there by Blue. \n\nAfter fleeing from the center, Yellow continues to Ilex Forest, where she finds Crystal, Silver, Red, Blue, and Green battling the Mask of Ice. As the Mask of Ice captures Celebi and traveled back in time, they find that Gold is trapped within time and needes the feathers to be freed. Gold and Yellow finally realize that the feathers are on her hat, and she is forced to take it off in front of Red in order to save Gold.

While there, she meets Silver, who believed that he may have originally come from this area and had ties to the Viridian Gym before he was kidnapped by Mask of Ice, and is now looking for his family. With her aid and the sudden arrival of the Team Rocket operatives Orm and Sird (whom the two promptly face in a battle), Silver learns that he was the son of Giovanni, former Viridian City Gym leader and head of Team Rocket. After he is kidnapped by the evil duo, Yellow gives chase on her [[Butterfree]], and soon manages to break into the Team Rocket helicopter to rescue him. Yellow is not a fighter but as she grows angry, her Pok\u00e9mons' levels rise to the eighties, making her as dangerous as the other Kanto champions in battle.

He lives in a house full of various Pok\u00e9mon in New Bark Town. Because of this, the neighbours have dubbed him \"The [[Pok\u00e9mon]] boy\". He starts with the Pok\u00e9mon [[Cyndaquil]]. Gold is immature and mischievous, and likes playing [[billiards]], sometimes using his Pok\u00e9mon to cheat. He often listens to the radio because of his idol, DJ Mary from the Goldenrod Radio Station. He usually wears a pair of [[goggles]] and travels on a scooter. Instead of throwing or kicking his [[Pok\u00e9 Balls]], he uses a billiard cue to shoot them out. Gold's hobbies include gambling, skateboarding, and trying foods from different cities. Gold's special skill, as described by Professor Oak, is Pok\u00e9mon hatching and is known as the \"Breeder\". He has the ability to draw out the largest potential of a baby Pok\u00e9mon, having lived with Pok\u00e9mon his whole life.\n\nIn truth, Gold is a kind-hearted but very hot-headed young man. When he first meets [[Bugsy (Pok\u00e9mon)|Bugsy]], he mistakes him for a female and asked him out for tea. He also asks [[Jasmine (Pok\u00e9mon)|Jasmine]], the Olivine City [[Gym Leader]] out on a date. However, he is quite smart, as shown when like when facing Lance's Dragonair, and when fighting at the Pok\u00e9athlon. When he first met Crystal he did not get along with her.\n\nAlong with his rival, Silver and Crystal, Gold fights with the other Pok\u00e9dex holders against the Mask of Ice, managing to cure Pryce (the true identity of the Mask of Ice) of his sadness with the help of [[Celebi (Pok\u00e9mon)|Celebi]]. He even sacrifices himself without hesitating to stop Pryce, then being saved by [[Celebi (Pok\u00e9mon)|Celebi]].

After Gold's friends are released from stone, he, alongside Emerald and all previous Pok\u00e9dex holders fight Guile Hideout, and after defeating him, host a Pok\u00e9mon Battle tournament. \n\nIn the ''HeartGold and SoulSilver'' arc, Gold returns as a main character, and takes part in the Pok\u00e9athlon.

In the end of the saga, he reunites with Green and helps in defeating the Mask of Ice and disbanding his organization, Neo Team Rocket.\n\nSilver makes his reappearance in the ''FireRed and LeafGreen'' arc as he is searching for clues to find his family. After seeking the help of Yellow in Virdian City, Sird of Team Rocket reveals Silver that he is Giovanni's son. Silver refuses to believe this, until Giovanni risks his life to save him. This caused Silver to accept Giovanni as his father, and decides to help him find redemption. In the end of the saga, he is turned to stone by Team Rocket.

As a child, she fell after getting startled by an Arcanine, and broke both of her arms. Because of the accident, she learned to catch Pok\u00e9mon by kicking [[Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s, a habit she has kept long after her arms healed.\n\nShe has many Pok\u00e9mon before first appearing, but her \"starter\" Pok\u00e9mon is a [[Chikorita]] which escaped from Professor Elm's laboratory, desperate to go on a journey. Her Pok\u00e9mon include a [[Smoochum]] (named Chumee), a [[Hitmonchan]] (Monlee), a [[Parasect]] (Parasee), an [[Arcanine]] (Archy), a [[Natu (Pok\u00e9mon)|Natu]] (Natee), and a [[Cubone]] (Bonee). She is chosen by Suicune, a legendary Pok\u00e9mon to help defeat the Mask of Ice.\n\nShe dispatches [[Emerald (Pok\u00e9mon)|Emerald]] to the Battle Frontier to find and capture [[Jirachi]], as a way to free Silver, Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow from stone.\n\nCrys is usually gentle and amiable, but also has a serious and perhaps intimidating side when it comes to working. Her aggressive and enthusiastic attitude in Pok\u00e9mon capturing overwhelms Oak, terrifies Bill, and Gold is fond of calling her the \"Representative of Club Serious\". In the Emerald series, she successfully gets Ruby and Sapphire to join her side in scorning Gold's bragging, although the same cannot be said for Emerald. Crys currently works as Oak's assistant, and stations either at his Kanto, Johto, or Hoenn Science Lab branch.\n\nAccording to the series, she has captured at least one of every non-legendary Pok\u00e9mon in the world and has completed the Pok\u00e9dex in every incarnation.\n\nCrys's design is based on the female protagonist of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal]]'', the third sequel to ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Gold]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Silver]]''. Her appearance is almost identical to her game counterpart, with the exception of a pair of star-shaped earrings, and her hair colour, which is dark blue instead of the game character's greenish-blue.\n\nIn the ''HeartGold and SoulSilver'' arc, Crystal returns as the main character. She is forced by her mother to wear clothes similar to those of Lyra, the female protagonist in the [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|'' Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']] games.\n\nShe was voted as the twelfth most popular character in the series in Japan 2011.<ref name=\"poll\"/>\n\n===Hoenn Pok\u00e9dex Holders ===\n*{{nihongo4|'''Ruby'''|\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc|Rub\u012b}} is a Trainer from the [[Johto]] region. He moves with his mother to [[Hoenn]] to live closer to his father [[Norman (Pok\u00e9mon)|Norman]], the Gym Leader of Petalburg City. Despite being a Gym Leader's son, Ruby hates battling and prefers [[Pok\u00e9mon Contest]]s.\n\nRuby is introduced as a vain and condescending young man but it is revealed that he does have a good heart. He arrives in Hoenn on his eleventh birthday, and runs away from his new home since he believes that his father Norman would not endorse his choice to be a Pok\u00e9mon Coordinator. This is initially true, but Norman had decided to let Ruby become a Coordinator at this point.\n\nAfter running away, he met [[Sapphire (Pok\u00e9mon)|Sapphire]], the daughter of [[Professor Birch]]. Sapphire challenges Ruby with the bet that is eighty days, they would both travel around Hoenn, each trying to achieve their respective goals (he would try to win every Contest and she would try to win all eight Hoenn Gym Badges).\n\nHis first three Pok\u00e9mon are Nana (a [[Poochyena]]), Kiki (a [[Skitty]]), and Rara (a [[Ralts]]). He lends Rara to [[Wally (Pok\u00e9mon)|Wally]], but due to an earthquake which separates them, he does not get her back until much later. Ruby's other Pok\u00e9mon are Feefee (a [[Feebas]]), Fofo (a [[Castform]]), and Mumu (a [[Mudkip]]). In Volume 22, it is revealed that Ruby also owns a Celebi that he came across in Johto.\n\nRuby may dislike Pok\u00e9mon Battles, but he is a capable Pok\u00e9mon Trainer in his own right. At the age of six, he actually liked climbing trees and battling Pok\u00e9mon. However, when he injured himself while protecting a girl from a Salamence, the girl became frightened and cried. Ruby assumed at the time that the reason the girl was scared was because he fought too fiercely. From that day onwards, he tried not to battle, only resorting to it when no one else was watching him or he has no other choice, focusing only on the beauty and non-combat qualities of his Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nIt is revealed in Volume 21 that Ruby likes Sapphire and she was the girl who Ruby had rescued, though neither of them recognized the other when they met at the beginning of the arc. Ruby realizes her identity when she reminisces the event, and reveals his identity to her by showing her a scar on his forehead, which he sustained while holding off the wild Salamence.\n\nRuby is based on [[Brendan (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brendan]] in the Pok\u00e9mon video games, just like how Sapphire is based on May. However, unlike Brendan, Ruby is a Pok\u00e9mon Coordinator and Brendan a [[Pok\u00e9mon Trainer]].\n\nIn the ''Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire'' arc, Ruby returns as a main character.\n\nHe was voted as the third most popular character in the series in Japan 2005 & 2011.<ref name=\"poll\"/>\n\n*'''Sapphire Birch''', known in Japan as {{nihongo4|'''Sapphire Odamaki'''|\u30aa\u30c0\u30de\u30ad\u30fb\u30b5\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2|Odamaki Safaia}} is a protagonist in the Ruby & Sapphire arc and recurring character in the Battle Frontier arc of the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Adventures]]'' manga, first appearing in Volume 15. She returns in the ''Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire'' arc, as a main character.\n\nThe daughter of [[Professor Birch]], Sapphire is a wild [[tomboy]], with absolutely no manners, who usually wears clothing made out of leaves. She eventually encountered [[Ruby (Pok\u00e9mon)|Ruby]], the son of Petalburg Gym Leader [[Norman (Pok\u00e9mon)|Norman]], who was in the process of running away from his new home in Littleroot Town.\n\nWhile saving Ruby from two [[Mightyena]], Sapphire injures herself. In gratitude for saving him, Ruby tends to her wounds makes made an outfit for her. In Volume 19, it is shown that the reason why Sapphire chose to wear the clothes he made for her was because he wrote, in a letter enclosed with the clothes, that the clothes would definitely fit her. Sapphire gets another outfit change at the end of Volume 19. Once again, Ruby makes the clothes for her, and told her personally that the new clothes would fit her.\n\nSapphire may be wild and tomboyish, but she is a devoted Pok\u00e9mon Trainer who would go to any lengths to achieve her goals and protect what she treasures most. She is very upset by Ruby declaring that he would rather go back to [[Johto]] than stand beside the Gym Leaders as they prepare to face Team Aqua and Team Magma. She persuades [[Winona (Pok\u00e9mon)|Winona]] to battle her, and the Gym Leader is so impressed by her fighting spirit and her will to defend [[Hoenn]] that she gave Sapphire the Feather Badge.\n\nIn Volume 21, Sapphire is revealed to have a crush on Ruby, though it had been hinted on several occasions before that. In the Emerald arc, however, Ruby claims to have forgotten the events during the Groudon and Kyogre affair including their confession of their feelings for each other due to the time void while leaving Mirage Island; whether or not this is true, however, has yet to be proven. In the Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire arc, it's hinted that Ruby was probably faking and that he seems to have feelings for Sapphire.\n\nThe reason for Sapphire's wild, tomboyish personality is due to an incident that occurred when she and Ruby met briefly at the age of five. The two were attacked by a wild (later revealed to be Zinnia's) [[Salamence]]. Ruby protected Sapphire, leading her to believe that she should stand up for herself more. It is highly probable that, because of this belief, she chose to abandon her docile personality, turning her attention to Pok\u00e9mon Battles. She did not recognize Ruby when they encountered again, only realizing his identity when she saw the scar on his forehead which he received during the Salamence attack.\n\nSapphire is based on May. May is the female character from the video games. However, Sapphire's character is notably different from the other two versions of May, especially the version from the anime, in terms of personality and attitude.\n\nIn the ''Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire'' arc, Sapphire returns as a main character.\n\nShe was voted as the fifth most popular character in the series in Japan 2011, tied with Diamond.<ref name=\"poll\"/>\n\n*{{nihongo4|'''Emerald'''|\u30a8\u30e1\u30e9\u30eb\u30c9|Emerarudo}} is a challenger in the [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire#Pok.C3.A9mon Emerald|Battle Frontier]].

He is also considered to be exceptional at catching Pok\u00e9mon, and for that [[#Crystal|Crystal]] has hired him to catch the legendary Jirachi.\n\nArrogant and impatient, despite his great interest and expert knowledge in Pok\u00e9mon battling, he claims to not like Pok\u00e9mon very much, claiming that his belief is that Pok\u00e9mon cannot win in a battle by using the trainer's faith in them over strategy. However, this belief shifts when he acquires [[Sceptile]], [[Sudowoodo]] and [[Dusclops]] from the Battle Frontier, coming to accept them more as friends rather than tools. He appears to be extremely short, and he is actually shorter than he looks. Under his long sleeved clothes he has high platform shoes, and he always holds a pair of external mechanical hands which he holds with his real hands. However, these are mostly tactical places to keep most of his capturing equipment; for example, his platform shoes include several rows with different kinds of Pok\u00e9balls. He also has a rare ability to calm Pok\u00e9mon by making them remember their birthplace. Emerald does so using soil from the Pok\u00e9mon's birthplace, which is compacted and placed into a special gun he carries. By shooting the ground the Pok\u00e9mon is standing on, the feeling can calm the Pok\u00e9mon in a matter of seconds.\n\nWhen the Battle Frontier is attacked by rampaged Pok\u00e9mon from the Battle Factory that Guile Hideout releases, Noland allowed Emerald to have a rampaged [[Snorlax]], [[Mantine]] and [[Mr. Mime]] to help him out. These are the other three Pok\u00e9mon in Emerald's main team.

Being twelve years old, Diamond started out with a [[Munchlax]] called Lax.\n\nDiamond is a good friend of [[Pearl (Pok\u00e9mon)|Pearl]] and the pair form a Pok\u00e9mon comedy duo, with Diamond acting as the [[Glossary of owarai terms#boke|boke]] (funny man) of the pair. Though seemingly dim-witted at first and possessing a perpetual habit of eating wherever he goes, Diamond is somewhat smarter than he looks. He stands up to foes in times of distress, and has been shown to be observant in a mishap involving wild [[Bidoof]].\n\nDue to a mix-up, Pearl believes that he and Diamond are on a [[reality television]] series; if they successfully escort [[Berlitz (Pok\u00e9mon)|Ms. Berlitz]] to Mt. Coronet, they will receive a prize (this is untrue, however, as Diamond has suspected something was wrong since the beginning, and chose to stay silent so that the journey could continue). Berlitz, believing the duo to be her bodyguards, gives them Pok\u00e9dexes, Pok\u00e9tches, and starter Pok\u00e9mon from [[Professor Rowan]].

He and [[Diamond (Pok\u00e9mon)|Diamond]] are friends, though Pearl is known for frequently getting them into trouble.  Together, they form a Pok\u00e9mon comedy duo with Pearl acting as the [[tsukkomi]] (straight man) of their duo.\n\nBecause of a mix-up, he thinks that escorting [[Berlitz (Pok\u00e9mon)|Ms. Berlitz]] to Mt. Coronet is part of a [[reality television]] show and by accomplishing this task, they will win a prize.  Berlitz, believing the duo to be her bodyguards, gives them Pok\u00e9dexes, Pok\u00e9tches, and starter Pok\u00e9mon from [[Professor Rowan]].  Pearl receives a [[Chimchar]], which he nicknames \"Chimler\", from Berlitz, which has evolved into an [[Infernape]].

She does not give her name to \"commoners\"; therefore, her given name was previously unknown. However, her name was revealed as Platinum to coincide with the recently released (at the time) game, ''Pok\u00e9mon Platinum Version''. In official materials, she is referred to as {{nihongo4|Ojousama|\u304a\u5b22\u3055\u307e|Oj\u014dsama|roughly translated as \"m'lady\"}}, or \"Lady\" in the English translation.\n\nThe Berlitz family tradition is for members coming of age to travel to the peak of Mt. Coronet to obtain materials to make their personal family crest. At the suggestion of Berlitz's butler, Sebastian, her father hired two bodyguards to protect her in her journey. Professor Rowan provided her with three Pok\u00e9dexes, three Pok\u00e9tches, and three of his starter Pok\u00e9mon so that Platinum would share them with her bodyguards to assist him in his research.\n\nShe owns a [[Piplup]] and a [[Ponyta]]. Her [[Piplup]] has evolved into a [[Prinplup]] then an [[Empoleon]]. Her Ponyta evolved into a Rapidash when she confronted [[Byron]]. Platinum is very competitive; over the course of her story, she has entered contests and battled gym leaders. She has caught a [[Lopunny]], which she brings out for the first time during her battle with Candice.  During the battle at Spear Pillar, Gardenia gives Platinum a Cherrim, Candice gives Platinum a Froslass and Volkner asked Maylene to give Platinum a Pachirisu.\n\nIn the Platinum arc, she works together with Looker, an officer of the International Police. Her aim is to find and rescue the two men originally hired to be her bodyguards, who had been banished to the Distortion World. Looker suggests challenging the Frontier Brains of the Sinnoh Battle Frontier so that they may reveal any information that they know.\n\nPlatinum's design is based on the female player character of [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'', ''Pearl'']], and [[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum|''Platinum'']], Dawn.\n\nShe was voted as the eleventh most popular character in the series in Japan 2011.<ref name=\"poll\"/>\n\n===Unova Pok\u00e9dex Holders===\n*{{nihongo4|'''Black'''|\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af|Burakku}} is one of the protagonists of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures.

She admitted to him that she had never battled before. When N's Purrloin had attacked Gigi, instead of commanding Gigi to attack or defend against Purrloin, she told Purrloin off for attacking an actress.\n\nWhite's design is based on the female player of [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']].\n\nAfter a successful opening of her latest brainchild, the Pok\u00e9mon Musical, White is suddenly trapped in a Ferris wheel by N, who convinces Gigi to leave White.

'''E'''vil '''T'''usks\". Three Gym Leaders - Lt. Surge, Sabrina and Koga - serve directly under the first incarnation of Team Rocket. A fourth Gym Leader, Blaine, used to work for Team Rocket as their scientist, but now joins the alliance of Kanto Gym Leaders not affiliated with Team Rocket (Brock, Misty and Erika).\n\nThe first incarnation of [[Team Rocket]] is led by Giovanni - the Gym Leader of Viridian City and deputised by three high-profile members of Team Rocket - Ken, Al and Harry, which proclaim themselves as an \"Elite Trio\". They aim to exploit Pok\u00e9mon and conquer the world.\n\nCarr, Orm and Sird are the deputies of the second incarnation of Team Rocket, exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Adventures. They call themselves the Three Beasts. Carr reacted angrily when he found out that Giovanni was searching for his son, and thus tried to wrestle control of Team Rocket. He also attempted to revive Team Rocket at the start of the ''HeartGold & SoulSilver'' arc, but was stopped by the Four Generals, who claimed that those who do not follow Giovanni's ideal were not truly representative of Team Rocket. It was also revealed that Sird was originally a founding member of Team Galactic, who pretended to be loyal to Team Rocket but was in fact meant to capture Deoxys for Team Galactic. Before \"joining\" Team Rocket, she came across the weakened Maxie and Archie and presented a sword and armor to the winner of a fight to the death between Maxie and Archie. Due to an ankle injury sustained on her escape from Kanto, Sird assumed control of a Team Galactic grunt's body and continued operations using his body.\n\n===Neo Team Rocket===\nPryce, the Gym Leader of Mahogany Town, leads the first incarnation of Neo Team Rocket under a masked disguise called Mask of Ice. In the past, he captured Ho-Oh and used it to recruit six talented youngsters that would help him achieve his goal of travelling through time. Carl and Sham were based on the designs of the Neo Rocket Executives in ''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Pok\u00e9mon Silver''. Will and Karen, like Carl and Sham, were loyal to Pryce (and thus saw his face behind the mask) but after Pryce's disappearance, formed a new Elite Four with ex-Team Rocket deputy Koga and former Elite Four member Bruno. Finally, Green and Silver, who were kidnapped by Pryce and thus never saw his face, escaped from Pryce when they had the chance, becoming recognized Pok\u00e9dex holders that contributed to Pryce's defeat in the voids of time.\n\nThe second incarnation of Neo Team Rocket, led by Archer, Ariana, Proton and Petrel, who are collectively named as the Four Generals, appears in the ''HeartGold & SoulSilver'' arc. They aimed to control Arceus, the deity of Pok\u00e9mon, in order to convince their former leader Giovanni to return. They achieved this by fooling the arc's main protagonists (Gold, Silver and Crystal) into helping them. Arceus created the creation trio of Dialga, Palkia and Giratina, and all appeared to be ready for Giovanni's return. Giovanni did indeed return, but with Lance and Pryce, both of which were antagonists of previous arcs, and worked together with the three main protagonists to stop the creation trio from destroying the world.\n\n===Team Aqua and Team Magma===\n[[Team Aqua]] and [[Team Magma]] are the criminal entities based in [[Hoenn]]. Led by Archie and Maxie respectively, the two teams are portrayed very differently in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures. Team Aqua is the more established organization that aims to expand the sea; its leader is even the boss of a television station, thus allowing Team Aqua to cover up their actions, including the ending of volcanic activity at Mt. Chimney. Team Magma is the smaller, more disjointed organization that aims to expand the land, but often has little sense of direction. During the climax of the ''Ruby & Sapphire'' arc, the two leaders strike a deal to reach the bottom of the sea together. They later assume control of the Blue Orb and Red Orb respectively. However, Archie and Maxie lose control of the orbs, which sink into their bodies. Kyogre and Groudon eventually reach Sootopolis City and start clashing once again. Even after the orbs are knocked out of Archie and Maxie's bodies, the clash continues, and after the clash is stopped, Archie and Maxie re-emerge with greater wickedness and savagery in their minds, and announce their intention to crush anyone that dares to defy them.\n\nIn the ''Emerald'' arc, Guile Hideout's real identity was revealed as Archie. He was the one who had won the sword and armor from Sird, having beaten Maxie in a fight to the death, and managed to summon a giant Kyogre-like monster to expand the sea, but ultimately disappeared in a flash of light after losing his armour, as well as control of the Battle Frontier's rental Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n===Team Galactic===\n[[Team Galactic]] is the criminal entity based in [[Sinnoh]]. Their aim of creating a new world had been planned for several years. At the end of the ''Diamond & Pearl'' arc, their leader Cyrus, who had been defeated by Diamond, Pearl and Platinum, is dragged into the Distortion World. In the ''Platinum'' arc, Team Galactic's scientist Charon becomes the new leader of the team, although the commanders - Mars, Jupiter and Saturn - still regarded Cyrus as their true boss, and tried to find him. In the Distortion World, Cyrus realized that his efforts to create a new world was all in vain - he only ended up creating a portal to the Distortion World. After Charon is ultimately stopped, Cyrus announced the disbandment of Team Galactic.\n\n===Team Plasma===\n[[Team Plasma]] is the criminal entity based in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White#Setting|Unova]]. The lesser members of the organization believe that N, a mysterious green-haired man, is their leader, and idolize him like a king. However, in truth N was brainwashed by Ghetsis, the true mastermind behind Team Plasma, whose aim is not to liberate Pok\u00e9mon, but make all the Pok\u00e9mon Team Plasma.\n\n===Neo Team Plasma===\nNeo Team Plasma is the new criminal entity based in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2#Setting|Unova]]. They aim to rule Unova by freezing the region. They are led by Ghetsis, and surrogate led by Colress.\n\n===Team Flare===\n[[Team Flare]] is the main evil organization of the [[Kalos]] region. They already appear to have a major influence over Kalos by owning the region's central media outlets to cover up their work. They seek to use X's Mega Ring to succeed in their plans, as well as seeking out [[Xerneas]] and [[Yveltal]]. Members include the leader Lysandre, scientists Xerosic, Aliana, Bryony, Celosia and Mable, newsreader Malva and butler Chalmers.\n\n===Team Skull/Aether Foundation===\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Video games|Anime and manga}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Pok\u00e9mon manga}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pokemon Adventures Protagonists}}\n[[Category:Lists of Pok\u00e9mon characters|Adventures protagonists]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Pok\u00e9mon Adventures'' characters}}\n[[File:Pokemon adventures characters.png|thumb|A collage of the series characters appearing in ''Pok\u00e9mon Adventures''.

He starts his Pok\u00e9mon journey with a [[Bulbasaur]] he received from [[Professor Oak]], which evolved into [[Ivysaur]] and later [[Venusaur]]. He is rivals with Professor Oak's grandson, [[List of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures characters#Blue|Blue]]. He caught a Pikachu that became his main Pokemon.\n\nIn the first arc, Red suffers his first overwhelming defeat when he fails to capture the mysterious [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]], leading him to Professor Oak for advice on becoming a better Pok\u00e9mon trainer. Professor Oak gives him a Pok\u00e9dex, and sends him on a long journey across Kanto to record all of the pok\u00e9mon, crossing paths with Blue and Green along the way. During his journey, he is entangled in many plots by the nefarious [[Team Rocket]], effectively foiling them each time. Together with Blue and Green, Red ultimately defeats Team Rocket when they tried to take control of [[Articuno]], [[Zapdos]] and [[Moltres]]. Red also defeats the Team Rocket leader [[Giovanni (Pok\u00e9mon)|Giovanni]] in a one-on-one Pok\u00e9mon battle and captures Team Rocket's ultimate weapon, the genetically created Pok\u00e9mon [[Mewtwo]]. Finally, Red participates in the Indigo Plateau Pok\u00e9mon League Tournament, overcoming his rival Blue in the final match and becoming the Pok\u00e9mon Champion.\n\nRed plays a smaller role in the ''Yellow'' saga, during which he is captured by the [[Elite Four]], a quartet of evil Pok\u00e9mon trainers, after refusing to participate in their plans. He is later rescued by Giovanni, and defeats the Elite Four alongside his allies. In the ''Gold, Silver & Crystal'' saga, he attempts to become Gym Leader of Viridian City, but injuries sustained from when he was captured by the Elite Four prevent him from doing so. After recovering from his injuries, he aids his allies in fighting the Mask of Ice (Pryce), the leader of [[Pok\u00e9mon crime syndicates#Team Rocket|Neo Team Rocket]].\n\nRed returns to a leading role in the ''FireRed and LeafGreen'' saga, where he teams up with Blue and Green to rescue Professor Oak, who has been kidnapped and taken to the Sevii Islands. While there, he encounters a newly revived Team Rocket and the Pok\u00e9mon Deoxys. After his team loses to them, Mewtwo appears to help them. The team then manage to defeat Giovanni and Deoxys and other companions but Red, along with Green, Blue, Yellow, and Silver, is turned into stone. He and his companions were eventually freed from their petrified forms in the ''Emerald'' saga.\n\nRed appears again alongside Green in Hoenn when they went there during the ''Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire'' saga and confronted Maxie and Archie. Though his Venusaur is capable of Mega Evolution, they are defeated after Groudon becomes Primal Groudon, but were saved thanks to Giovanni who took them on his airship.\n\nRed's Pok\u00e9mon include Saur (Venasaur), Poli (Poliwrath), Snor (Snorlax), Aero (Aerodactyl), Gyara (Gyarados), and Pika (Pikachu). While Red was frozen by the Elite Four, his Pika had to team up with Yellow, and while Red left for the hot springs, he again asked Yellow to take care of Pika. \nIn Japan, Red was voted by readers from the series as its most popular character in 2005 & 2011.<ref name=\"poll\">{{cite web|url=http://family.shogakukan.co.jp/kids/netkun/pokemon/official/story/0904/popular_human.html|title=Popular Human|publisher=Shogagkukan|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 12, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109062442/http://family.shogakukan.co.jp/kids/netkun/pokemon/official/story/0904/popular_human.html|archivedate=January 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\n*'''Blue Oak''', known in Japan as {{nihongo4|'''Green \u014ckido'''|\u30aa\u30fc\u30ad\u30c9\u30fb\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3|\u014ckido Gur\u012bn}}<!--This is the ENGLISH-language Wikipedia, so we use the English names of the characters.--> is a Trainer who starts his journey with a [[Charmander]] and continues to train it well throughout his adventures even after it evolves into [[Charizard]]. Starting out quite cocky and aloof, Blue becomes more down-to-earth and sociable as the series progresses. He specializes in training Pok\u00e9mon, even those that are not his. He is the rival of [[#Red|Red]], though the ferocity of their rivalry has toned down as the series progresses. He is also Professor Oak's grandson, and he has a sister named Daisy.\n\nIn the first arc, Blue attempts to capture the mirage Pok\u00e9mon [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]] but backs down as soon as he realizes his opponent is far superior. Witnessing Red's attempt to catch it without hesitation sparks his resentment. He later encounters Red again in Viridian Forest, when he begins to reconsider his view of Red when he helps heal the wounded young of a [[Kangaskhan]] he has been trying to capture. Seeing each other's faults, Blue and Red become official rivals. After Red saves him when he becomes possessed by a wild [[Gastly]] in the Pok\u00e9mon Tower, Blue collaborates with him to defeat Team Rocket member Koga. When they later encounter, they accidentally swap all their Pok\u00e9mon with each other, so Blue takes the liberty of training Red's Pok\u00e9mon to their limits. The two rivals work together again, this time with [[#Blue|Blue]], when Professor Oak is kidnapped by Team Rocket, narrowly defeating Koga again as well as the captured [[Articuno]], [[Zapdos]] and [[Moltres]]. Applying everything he learned from Red, Blue faces off against Red in the final match of the Indigo Plateau Pok\u00e9mon League Tournament. Although he loses the battle, he considers Red to be a true friend and important companion.\n\nIn the ''Yellow'' saga, Blue helps train the rookie Pok\u00e9mon trainer [[#Yellow|Yellow]] during her search for Red, who had been kidnapped by the Elite Four.

He later defeats his childhood teacher, the Gym Leader [[Chuck (Pok\u00e9mon)|Chuck]], in a tournament pitting Johto Gym Leaders against the Kanto Leaders. He and the other Gym Leaders are tricked into boarding the Magnet Train while it is rigged to crash, but are rescued by Red.

She makes her debut in Volume 2, by trying to sell fake items to Red after flirting with him. As the series progressed, however, she decides to team up with the other Pallet Town trainers, Red and Blue, in order to defeat [[Sabrina (Pok\u00e9mon)|Sabrina]] of [[Team Rocket]].\n\nGreen returns later in the saga, having qualified for the Pok\u00e9mon League Tournament. She progresses through the tournament and into the semifinals, but is defeated by Professor Oak, who uses bird Pok\u00e9mon, [[Ornithophobia|as it was her phobia]]. Upon learning of her problem, Professor Oak takes pity on her, giving her the third Pok\u00e9dex and forgiving her for stealing his Squirtle.\n\nIn the ''Yellow'' Saga, set two years later, Green is a sort of \"shadow\" trainer, trailing [[Yellow (Pok\u00e9mon)|Yellow]]. She is the one who sends Yellow on a mission to find Red and disguise herself as a boy. In the third volume, it is revealed that Green had been snatched at the age of five by a [[Ho-Oh|mysterious bird Pok\u00e9mon]], which gave her a debilitating phobia of bird type Pok\u00e9mon. Green blamed the [[Elite Four]] for this disaster, carrying a grudge against the Elite Four into the ''Gold/Silver'' saga.\n\nIn the ''Gold, Silver & Crystal'' saga, Green first appears in volume 13, when she is shown at a Pok\u00e9mon Gym Leader's Tournament. It is revealed that she and [[#Silver|Silver]] were two of the Masked Children, and had escaped from the grasp of the Mask of Ice, the leader of [[Pok\u00e9mon crime syndicates#Team Rocket|Neo Team Rocket]], at a young age, while others abducted along with them remained and became the Mask of Ice's servants. Because of this, she shares a close bond with Silver and frequently treats him like a younger brother. She later helps out in the final battle against the Mask of Ice by using the three legendary birds with Red and Blue, and overcomes her bird phobia whilst protecting Silver.\n\nIn the ''FireRed and LeafGreen'' saga, Green appears while traveling to the Sevii Islands to meet her parents. However, Psychic Pok\u00e9mon [[Deoxys]] capturs her parents, causing Green to faint in shock when she is injured in the encounter with it. When she wakes, not fully recovered, she and Blue discover that Red was defeated by Deoxys, and rushes to his side after he runs away to recollect himself. She reveals to him the real reason why Professor Oak wanted Red and the others to return their Pok\u00e9dex and Green resolves to train, despite not being fully healed, to fight against Team Rocket and Deoxys.

A character exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, she has the powers to heal Pok\u00e9mon and hear their thoughts, because she was born in the Viridian Forest. She is a happy-go-lucky girl who isn't very good at Pok\u00e9mon battles as she dislikes them because she cannot bring herself to hurt Pok\u00e9mon. There have also been hints throughout the manga that she has a crush on Red.\n\nShe first appears in the final volume of the first arc, though her name is not revealed until the ''Yellow'' saga. Having lost her way in the Viridian Forest, Yellow is attacked by a wild [[Dratini]]. [[#Red|Red]] saves her and escorted her back to her hometown, Viridian City, and helps her catch her first [[Pok\u00e9mon]], a [[Rattata]]. Later, Yellow finds Red seriously injured following his battle with [[Giovanni (Pok\u00e9mon)|Giovanni]], and helps him.\n\nTwo years later, Yellow shows up at Professor Oak's lab disguised as a boy, and obtains Red's Pok\u00e9dex and pikachu. [[#Green|Green]] had sent her on a mission to rescue Red from the Kanto [[Elite Four]], because of her mysterious powers that allow her to heal and communicate with Pok\u00e9mon, which counter the same powers of Lance, the leader of the Elite Four. Yellow fights against the Elite Four while defending Pika, Red's pikachu, which had escaped from them. Despite opposition from the Kanto Leaders who are Red's friends, Yellow is supported by Professor Oak. Yellow encounters the Elite Four and meets Bill and Blaine. Yellow also trains with Blue. Yellow then joins forces with the Gym Leaders, Bill, Blue, Green, and the former members of Team Rocket. In the final battle, with the help of Giovanni, who also has the special powers, Yellow defeats Lance. She stops the Elite Four from gaining control of a mysterious, powerful, Pok\u00e9mon, later revealed to be Lugia. Her true gender is revealed at the end of Volume 6, but she puts off informing Red of it.\n\nIn the ''Gold, Silver & Crystal'' saga, Yellow travels to [[Johto]] and meets up with [[Crystal (Pok\u00e9mon)|Crystal]] while pursuing Lugia. It is revealed that Yellow was the one who woke up the three legendary beasts - [[Suicune]], [[Raikou (Pok\u00e9mon)|Raikou]], and [[Entei (Pok\u00e9mon)|Entei]] - from within the Burned Tower in [[Johto#Ecruteak City|Ecruteak]]. Yellow and Crystal are then separated by Lugia at sea.\n\nAfter the attack, Yellow and her uncle wash up on shore, where they are brought to the Pok\u00e9mon daycare center run by an elderly couple. Soon, the center is attacked by a group of [[Pok\u00e9mon crime syndicates#Team Rocket|Neo Team Rocket]] members who seem only to be interested in Yellow's hat. In truth, the two feathers on her hat are the Silver Wing from [[Lugia]] and the Rainbow Wing from [[Ho-Oh]], the keys to traveling in time, stolen from the Mask of Ice many years ago and planted there by Blue. \n\nAfter fleeing from the center, Yellow continues to Ilex Forest, where she finds Crystal, Silver, Red, Blue, and Green battling the Mask of Ice. As the Mask of Ice captures Celebi and traveled back in time, they find that Gold is trapped within time and needes the feathers to be freed. Gold and Yellow finally realize that the feathers are on her hat, and she is forced to take it off in front of Red in order to save Gold.

While there, she meets Silver, who believed that he may have originally come from this area and had ties to the Viridian Gym before he was kidnapped by Mask of Ice, and is now looking for his family. With her aid and the sudden arrival of the Team Rocket operatives Orm and Sird (whom the two promptly face in a battle), Silver learns that he was the son of Giovanni, former Viridian City Gym leader and head of Team Rocket. After he is kidnapped by the evil duo, Yellow gives chase on her [[Butterfree]], and soon manages to break into the Team Rocket helicopter to rescue him. Yellow is not a fighter but as she grows angry, her Pok\u00e9mons' levels rise to the eighties, making her as dangerous as the other Kanto champions in battle.

He lives in a house full of various Pok\u00e9mon in New Bark Town. Because of this, the neighbours have dubbed him \"The [[Pok\u00e9mon]] boy\". He starts with the Pok\u00e9mon [[Cyndaquil]]. Gold is immature and mischievous, and likes playing [[billiards]], sometimes using his Pok\u00e9mon to cheat. He often listens to the radio because of his idol, DJ Mary from the Goldenrod Radio Station. He usually wears a pair of [[goggles]] and travels on a scooter. Instead of throwing or kicking his [[Pok\u00e9 Balls]], he uses a billiard cue to shoot them out. Gold's hobbies include gambling, skateboarding, and trying foods from different cities. Gold's special skill, as described by Professor Oak, is Pok\u00e9mon hatching and is known as the \"Breeder\". He has the ability to draw out the largest potential of a baby Pok\u00e9mon, having lived with Pok\u00e9mon his whole life.\n\nIn truth, Gold is a kind-hearted but very hot-headed young man. When he first meets [[Bugsy (Pok\u00e9mon)|Bugsy]], he mistakes him for a female and asked him out for tea. He also asks [[Jasmine (Pok\u00e9mon)|Jasmine]], the Olivine City [[Gym Leader]] out on a date. However, he is quite smart, as shown when like when facing Lance's Dragonair, and when fighting at the Pok\u00e9athlon. When he first met Crystal he did not get along with her.\n\nAlong with his rival, Silver and Crystal, Gold fights with the other Pok\u00e9dex holders against the Mask of Ice, managing to cure Pryce (the true identity of the Mask of Ice) of his sadness with the help of [[Celebi (Pok\u00e9mon)|Celebi]]. He even sacrifices himself without hesitating to stop Pryce, then being saved by [[Celebi (Pok\u00e9mon)|Celebi]].

After Gold's friends are released from stone, he, alongside Emerald and all previous Pok\u00e9dex holders fight Guile Hideout, and after defeating him, host a Pok\u00e9mon Battle tournament. \n\nIn the ''HeartGold and SoulSilver'' arc, Gold returns as a main character, and takes part in the Pok\u00e9athlon.

In the end of the saga, he reunites with Green and helps in defeating the Mask of Ice and disbanding his organization, Neo Team Rocket.\n\nSilver makes his reappearance in the ''FireRed and LeafGreen'' arc as he is searching for clues to find his family. After seeking the help of Yellow in Virdian City, Sird of Team Rocket reveals Silver that he is Giovanni's son. Silver refuses to believe this, until Giovanni risks his life to save him. This caused Silver to accept Giovanni as his father, and decides to help him find redemption. In the end of the saga, he is turned to stone by Team Rocket.

As a child, she fell after getting startled by an Arcanine, and broke both of her arms. Because of the accident, she learned to catch Pok\u00e9mon by kicking [[Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s, a habit she has kept long after her arms healed.\n\nShe has many Pok\u00e9mon before first appearing, but her \"starter\" Pok\u00e9mon is a [[Chikorita]] which escaped from Professor Elm's laboratory, desperate to go on a journey. Her Pok\u00e9mon include a [[Smoochum]] (named Chumee), a [[Hitmonchan]] (Monlee), a [[Parasect]] (Parasee), an [[Arcanine]] (Archy), a [[Natu (Pok\u00e9mon)|Natu]] (Natee), and a [[Cubone]] (Bonee). She is chosen by Suicune, a legendary Pok\u00e9mon to help defeat the Mask of Ice.\n\nShe dispatches [[Emerald (Pok\u00e9mon)|Emerald]] to the Battle Frontier to find and capture [[Jirachi]], as a way to free Silver, Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow from stone.\n\nCrys is usually gentle and amiable, but also has a serious and perhaps intimidating side when it comes to working. Her aggressive and enthusiastic attitude in Pok\u00e9mon capturing overwhelms Oak, terrifies Bill, and Gold is fond of calling her the \"Representative of Club Serious\". In the Emerald series, she successfully gets Ruby and Sapphire to join her side in scorning Gold's bragging, although the same cannot be said for Emerald. Crys currently works as Oak's assistant, and stations either at his Kanto, Johto, or Hoenn Science Lab branch.\n\nAccording to the series, she has captured at least one of every non-legendary Pok\u00e9mon in the world and has completed the Pok\u00e9dex in every incarnation.\n\nCrys's design is based on the female protagonist of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal]]'', the third sequel to ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Gold]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Silver]]''. Her appearance is almost identical to her game counterpart, with the exception of a pair of star-shaped earrings, and her hair colour, which is dark blue instead of the game character's greenish-blue.\n\nIn the ''HeartGold and SoulSilver'' arc, Crystal returns as the main character. She is forced by her mother to wear clothes similar to those of Lyra, the female protagonist in the [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|'' Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']] games.\n\nShe was voted as the twelfth most popular character in the series in Japan 2011.<ref name=\"poll\"/>\n\n===Hoenn Pok\u00e9dex Holders ===\n*{{nihongo4|'''Ruby'''|\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc|Rub\u012b}} is a Trainer from the [[Johto]] region. He moves with his mother to [[Hoenn]] to live closer to his father [[Norman (Pok\u00e9mon)|Norman]], the Gym Leader of Petalburg City. Despite being a Gym Leader's son, Ruby hates battling and prefers [[Pok\u00e9mon Contest]]s.\n\nRuby is introduced as a vain and condescending young man but it is revealed that he does have a good heart. He arrives in Hoenn on his eleventh birthday, and runs away from his new home since he believes that his father Norman would not endorse his choice to be a Pok\u00e9mon Coordinator. This is initially true, but Norman had decided to let Ruby become a Coordinator at this point.\n\nAfter running away, he met [[Sapphire (Pok\u00e9mon)|Sapphire]], the daughter of [[Professor Birch]]. Sapphire challenges Ruby with the bet that is eighty days, they would both travel around Hoenn, each trying to achieve their respective goals (he would try to win every Contest and she would try to win all eight Hoenn Gym Badges).\n\nHis first three Pok\u00e9mon are Nana (a [[Poochyena]]), Kiki (a [[Skitty]]), and Rara (a [[Ralts]]). He lends Rara to [[Wally (Pok\u00e9mon)|Wally]], but due to an earthquake which separates them, he does not get her back until much later. Ruby's other Pok\u00e9mon are Feefee (a [[Feebas]]), Fofo (a [[Castform]]), and Mumu (a [[Mudkip]]). In Volume 22, it is revealed that Ruby also owns a Celebi that he came across in Johto.\n\nRuby may dislike Pok\u00e9mon Battles, but he is a capable Pok\u00e9mon Trainer in his own right. At the age of six, he actually liked climbing trees and battling Pok\u00e9mon. However, when he injured himself while protecting a girl from a Salamence, the girl became frightened and cried. Ruby assumed at the time that the reason the girl was scared was because he fought too fiercely. From that day onwards, he tried not to battle, only resorting to it when no one else was watching him or he has no other choice, focusing only on the beauty and non-combat qualities of his Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nIt is revealed in Volume 21 that Ruby likes Sapphire and she was the girl who Ruby had rescued, though neither of them recognized the other when they met at the beginning of the arc. Ruby realizes her identity when she reminisces the event, and reveals his identity to her by showing her a scar on his forehead, which he sustained while holding off the wild Salamence.\n\nRuby is based on [[Brendan (Pok\u00e9mon)|Brendan]] in the Pok\u00e9mon video games, just like how Sapphire is based on May. However, unlike Brendan, Ruby is a Pok\u00e9mon Coordinator and Brendan a [[Pok\u00e9mon Trainer]].\n\nIn the ''Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire'' arc, Ruby returns as a main character.\n\nHe was voted as the third most popular character in the series in Japan 2005 & 2011.<ref name=\"poll\"/>\n\n*'''Sapphire Birch''', known in Japan as {{nihongo4|'''Sapphire Odamaki'''|\u30aa\u30c0\u30de\u30ad\u30fb\u30b5\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2|Odamaki Safaia}} is a protagonist in the Ruby & Sapphire arc and recurring character in the Battle Frontier arc of the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Adventures]]'' manga, first appearing in Volume 15. She returns in the ''Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire'' arc, as a main character.\n\nThe daughter of [[Professor Birch]], Sapphire is a wild [[tomboy]], with absolutely no manners, who usually wears clothing made out of leaves. She eventually encountered [[Ruby (Pok\u00e9mon)|Ruby]], the son of Petalburg Gym Leader [[Norman (Pok\u00e9mon)|Norman]], who was in the process of running away from his new home in Littleroot Town.\n\nWhile saving Ruby from two [[Mightyena]], Sapphire injures herself. In gratitude for saving him, Ruby tends to her wounds makes made an outfit for her. In Volume 19, it is shown that the reason why Sapphire chose to wear the clothes he made for her was because he wrote, in a letter enclosed with the clothes, that the clothes would definitely fit her. Sapphire gets another outfit change at the end of Volume 19. Once again, Ruby makes the clothes for her, and told her personally that the new clothes would fit her.\n\nSapphire may be wild and tomboyish, but she is a devoted Pok\u00e9mon Trainer who would go to any lengths to achieve her goals and protect what she treasures most. She is very upset by Ruby declaring that he would rather go back to [[Johto]] than stand beside the Gym Leaders as they prepare to face Team Aqua and Team Magma. She persuades [[Winona (Pok\u00e9mon)|Winona]] to battle her, and the Gym Leader is so impressed by her fighting spirit and her will to defend [[Hoenn]] that she gave Sapphire the Feather Badge.\n\nIn Volume 21, Sapphire is revealed to have a crush on Ruby, though it had been hinted on several occasions before that. In the Emerald arc, however, Ruby claims to have forgotten the events during the Groudon and Kyogre affair including their confession of their feelings for each other due to the time void while leaving Mirage Island; whether or not this is true, however, has yet to be proven. In the Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire arc, it's hinted that Ruby was probably faking and that he seems to have feelings for Sapphire.\n\nThe reason for Sapphire's wild, tomboyish personality is due to an incident that occurred when she and Ruby met briefly at the age of five. The two were attacked by a wild (later revealed to be Zinnia's) [[Salamence]]. Ruby protected Sapphire, leading her to believe that she should stand up for herself more. It is highly probable that, because of this belief, she chose to abandon her docile personality, turning her attention to Pok\u00e9mon Battles. She did not recognize Ruby when they encountered again, only realizing his identity when she saw the scar on his forehead which he received during the Salamence attack.\n\nSapphire is based on May. May is the female character from the video games. However, Sapphire's character is notably different from the other two versions of May, especially the version from the anime, in terms of personality and attitude.\n\nIn the ''Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire'' arc, Sapphire returns as a main character.\n\nShe was voted as the fifth most popular character in the series in Japan 2011, tied with Diamond.<ref name=\"poll\"/>\n\n*{{nihongo4|'''Emerald'''|\u30a8\u30e1\u30e9\u30eb\u30c9|Emerarudo}} is a challenger in the [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire#Pok.C3.A9mon Emerald|Battle Frontier]].

He is also considered to be exceptional at catching Pok\u00e9mon, and for that [[#Crystal|Crystal]] has hired him to catch the legendary Jirachi.\n\nArrogant and impatient, despite his great interest and expert knowledge in Pok\u00e9mon battling, he claims to not like Pok\u00e9mon very much, claiming that his belief is that Pok\u00e9mon cannot win in a battle by using the trainer's faith in them over strategy. However, this belief shifts when he acquires [[Sceptile]], [[Sudowoodo]] and [[Dusclops]] from the Battle Frontier, coming to accept them more as friends rather than tools. He appears to be extremely short, and he is actually shorter than he looks. Under his long sleeved clothes he has high platform shoes, and he always holds a pair of external mechanical hands which he holds with his real hands. However, these are mostly tactical places to keep most of his capturing equipment; for example, his platform shoes include several rows with different kinds of Pok\u00e9balls. He also has a rare ability to calm Pok\u00e9mon by making them remember their birthplace. Emerald does so using soil from the Pok\u00e9mon's birthplace, which is compacted and placed into a special gun he carries. By shooting the ground the Pok\u00e9mon is standing on, the feeling can calm the Pok\u00e9mon in a matter of seconds.\n\nWhen the Battle Frontier is attacked by rampaged Pok\u00e9mon from the Battle Factory that Guile Hideout releases, Noland allowed Emerald to have a rampaged [[Snorlax]], [[Mantine]] and [[Mr. Mime]] to help him out. These are the other three Pok\u00e9mon in Emerald's main team.

Being twelve years old, Diamond started out with a [[Munchlax]] called Lax.\n\nDiamond is a good friend of [[Pearl (Pok\u00e9mon)|Pearl]] and the pair form a Pok\u00e9mon comedy duo, with Diamond acting as the [[Glossary of owarai terms#boke|boke]] (funny man) of the pair. Though seemingly dim-witted at first and possessing a perpetual habit of eating wherever he goes, Diamond is somewhat smarter than he looks. He stands up to foes in times of distress, and has been shown to be observant in a mishap involving wild [[Bidoof]].\n\nDue to a mix-up, Pearl believes that he and Diamond are on a [[reality television]] series; if they successfully escort [[Berlitz (Pok\u00e9mon)|Ms. Berlitz]] to Mt. Coronet, they will receive a prize (this is untrue, however, as Diamond has suspected something was wrong since the beginning, and chose to stay silent so that the journey could continue). Berlitz, believing the duo to be her bodyguards, gives them Pok\u00e9dexes, Pok\u00e9tches, and starter Pok\u00e9mon from [[Professor Rowan]].

Diamond also bonded with the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Regigigas.\n\nDuring the Platinum arc Diamond and Pearl investigate the information in Charon's notebook, and ultimately end up having to stop Charon's evil plan of capturing all of Sinnoh's legends to take over the world.\n\nHe was voted as the fifth most popular character in the series in Japan 2011, tied with Sapphire.<ref name=\"poll\"/>\n\n*{{nihongo4|'''Pearl'''|\u30d1\u30fc\u30eb|P\u0101ru}} is a character from Sinnoh and one of the three leading characters in the Diamond and Pearl arc of [[Pok\u00e9mon Adventures]].\n\nPearl has a hasty personality and a habit of butting into conversations along with exploding with rage if a person does not give him eye contact when he speaks to them.  He and [[Diamond (Pok\u00e9mon)|Diamond]] are friends, though Pearl is known for frequently getting them into trouble.  Together, they form a Pok\u00e9mon comedy duo with Pearl acting as the [[tsukkomi]] (straight man) of their duo.\n\nBecause of a mix-up, he thinks that escorting [[Berlitz (Pok\u00e9mon)|Ms. Berlitz]] to Mt. Coronet is part of a [[reality television]] show and by accomplishing this task, they will win a prize.  Berlitz, believing the duo to be her bodyguards, gives them Pok\u00e9dexes, Pok\u00e9tches, and starter Pok\u00e9mon from [[Professor Rowan]].  Pearl receives a [[Chimchar]], which he nicknames \"Chimler\", from Berlitz, which has evolved into an [[Infernape]].  Along with Chimchar, he also has a [[Chatot (Pok\u00e9mon)|Chatot]] named Chatler. Later he gets a Luxray, that he befriended when the Luxray was still a Luxio. Later, with the help of Crasher Wake, Pearl captures a Tauros, Diglett and a Buizel (which likes to attack Pearl).\n\nDuring the Platinum arc Diamond and Pearl investigate the information in Charon's notebook, and ultimately end up having to stop Charon's evil plan of capturing all of Sinnoh's legends to take over the world.\n\nHis father is a fairly successful Pok\u00e9mon trainer, and Pearl has learned some useful talents from him; such as the ability to tell what move a Pok\u00e9mon is going to use just by its stance.\n\nHe is based on Barry, the rival character from [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] and its successor, ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum]]''.\n\nHe was voted as the tenth most popular character in the series in Japan 2011.<ref name=\"poll\"/>\n\n*{{nihongo4|'''Platinum Berlitz'''|\u30d7\u30e9\u30c1\u30ca\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4|Purachina Berurittsu|}} also known as Lady or Lady Platinum Berlitz is the female protagonist for the ''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' story arc of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Adventures]]''.\n\nPlatinum Berlitz comes from a 200-year-old family of wealthy scholars famous in Sinnoh and wears [[pearl]] and [[diamond]] rings. She does not give her name to \"commoners\"; therefore, her given name was previously unknown. However, her name was revealed as Platinum to coincide with the recently released (at the time) game, ''Pok\u00e9mon Platinum Version''. In official materials, she is referred to as {{nihongo4|Ojousama|\u304a\u5b22\u3055\u307e|Oj\u014dsama|roughly translated as \"m'lady\"}}, or \"Lady\" in the English translation.\n\nThe Berlitz family tradition is for members coming of age to travel to the peak of Mt. Coronet to obtain materials to make their personal family crest. At the suggestion of Berlitz's butler, Sebastian, her father hired two bodyguards to protect her in her journey. Professor Rowan provided her with three Pok\u00e9dexes, three Pok\u00e9tches, and three of his starter Pok\u00e9mon so that Platinum would share them with her bodyguards to assist him in his research.\n\nShe owns a [[Piplup]] and a [[Ponyta]]. Her [[Piplup]] has evolved into a [[Prinplup]] then an [[Empoleon]]. Her Ponyta evolved into a Rapidash when she confronted [[Byron]]. Platinum is very competitive; over the course of her story, she has entered contests and battled gym leaders. She has caught a [[Lopunny]], which she brings out for the first time during her battle with Candice.  During the battle at Spear Pillar, Gardenia gives Platinum a Cherrim, Candice gives Platinum a Froslass and Volkner asked Maylene to give Platinum a Pachirisu.\n\nIn the Platinum arc, she works together with Looker, an officer of the International Police. Her aim is to find and rescue the two men originally hired to be her bodyguards, who had been banished to the Distortion World. Looker suggests challenging the Frontier Brains of the Sinnoh Battle Frontier so that they may reveal any information that they know.\n\nPlatinum's design is based on the female player character of [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'', ''Pearl'']], and [[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum|''Platinum'']], Dawn.\n\nShe was voted as the eleventh most popular character in the series in Japan 2011.<ref name=\"poll\"/>\n\n===Unova Pok\u00e9dex Holders===\n*{{nihongo4|'''Black'''|\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af|Burakku}} is one of the protagonists of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures. He is a hot-headed trainer and meets White in an accident with a [[Galvantula]]; White makes it her responsibility to repay damages caused by Black to a filming company, and hires Black to her recruitment firm.  Black's design is based on the male character of [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']].\n\nBlack not only goes on a quest for the Gym Badges of Unova to enter the Pok\u00e9mon League, but also makes it an objective to defeat Team Plasma. He ultimately becomes the \"Hero of Truth\" after awakening Reshiram from the Light Stone, and battles N, the \"Hero of Ideals\" who had long awakened Zekrom from the Dark Stone. Black wins, but is then sealed in the Light Stone along with Reshiram.\n\nHe was voted as the fifteenth most popular character in the series in Japan in 2011. <ref name=\"poll\"/>\n\n*{{nihongo4|'''White'''|\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8|Howaito}} is one of the protagonists of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures. She owns a female [[Tepig]], named Gigi, and is the owner of a Pok\u00e9mon recruitment firm called the BW Agency, which rents Pok\u00e9mon to movies and ads.\n\nWhite is very reluctant to battle, and had panicked when Black had once told her, while battling N of Team Plasma, that she may need to battle. She admitted to him that she had never battled before. When N's Purrloin had attacked Gigi, instead of commanding Gigi to attack or defend against Purrloin, she told Purrloin off for attacking an actress.\n\nWhite's design is based on the female player of [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']].\n\nAfter a successful opening of her latest brainchild, the Pok\u00e9mon Musical, White is suddenly trapped in a Ferris wheel by N, who convinces Gigi to leave White. White recovers from the trauma of the event and takes up Pok\u00e9mon battling. She is rewarded with a Pok\u00e9dex after being given the opportunity to test her newly acquired skill. She also obtains N's Servine who follows her for a mysterious reason, which she evolves into Serperior and eventually grows close to.\n\nShe was voted as the twenty-second most popular character in the series in Japan in 2011. <ref name=\"poll\"/>\n\n*'''Blake''', known in Japan as {{nihongo4|'''Lack-Two'''|\u30e9\u30af\u30c4|Rakutsu}}<!--This is the ENGLISH-language Wikipedia, so we use the English names of the characters.--> is the main protagonist of the Black 2 and White 2 arc, who first appears as a member of the \"International Police\". As a member, he is given the task to search the previously defeated Neo Team Plasma. He initially appears to be a womanizer; however, he is actually a serious individual when he is on job.\n\nBlake is based on the male player character option from [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''Pok\u00e9mon Black 2'' and White 2'']]. Unlike previous characters in ''Pok\u00e9mon Adventures'', his Japanese name \"Lack-Two\" is a corruption of his representative game's title (''Black 2'') rather than a direct application.\n\n*'''Whitley''', known in Japan as {{nihongo4|'''Whi-Two'''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c4|Faitsu}} is one of the main characters of the Black 2 and White 2 arc. She is a former member of Team Plasma. Whitley is a very gentle girl who is against keeping her Pok\u00e9mon in Pokeballs.\n\nWhitley is designed after the female player character option from [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''Pok\u00e9mon Black 2'' and White 2'']]. Unlike previous characters in ''Pok\u00e9mon Adventures'', her Japanese name \"Whi-Two\" is a corruption of her representative game's title (''White 2'') rather than a direct application.\n\n===Kalos Pok\u00e9dex Holders===\n*{{nihongo4|'''X'''|\u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9|Ekkusu}} is one of the main characters of the X and Y arc. His close friends call him {{nihongo4|X-Ey|\u30a8\u30c3\uff30|Epp\u012b}}. As a Junior Trainer, he won a major Pok\u00e9mon Battle Tournament and everyone expects that he will become either a Gym Leader or a member of the Elite Four one day. The fame and [[paparazzi]] got to him, and he does not trust other people anymore, and he stays home as a shut in. It is only Y's urging that gets him to leave his house for the first time in several years and travel around Kalos. He possesses a Kangaskhan named {{nihongo4|Kanga|\u30ac\u30eb}}, as well as her child {{nihongo4|Lil' Kanga|\u30b3\u30ac\u30eb}}, that he uses in battle. He temporarily uses Chespin in battle, but later decides to keep it, nicknaming it Marisso, which has presently evolved into its final form Chesnaught. He also gains a Charizard nicknamed Salam\u00e8, a Manentric nicknamed \u00c9lec, a Gengar nicknamed Garma and a Pinsir nicknamed Rute. X also has a Mega Ring that Mega Evolves Kanga so both Kanga and Lil' Kanga can battle, as well as most of his other Pok\u00e9mon excluding Chesnaught (his Charizard possesses the Mega Stone for its Mega Charizard X form). Later during the battle against Zygarde, X borrows several Key Stones which allows him to use all of his Mega Pok\u00e9mon at the same time. At the end of the arc, X plans on heading for Shalour City to officially become a Mega Evolution Successor.\n\nX is designed after Calem from [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']].\n\n*{{nihongo4|'''Y'''|\u30ef\u30a4|Wai}} is one of the main characters of the X and Y arc.

She is a with her Fletchling, nicknamed Fletchy ({{nihongo4|\u30e4\u30b3\u3061\u3083\u3093|Yako-chan}}), which eventually evolved into Fletchinder. \n\nY was originally a talented Rhyhorn Racer, like her mother, but decided to pursue a new life as a Sky Trainer. She organizes the traveling around Kalos for herself and her friends Trevor, Tierno, Shauna, and X, despite X's desire to stay home due to his bad experiences as a child. She temporarily uses Froakie in battle, but later decides to keep it, nicknaming it Croaky ({{nihongo4|\u3051\u308d\u3051\u308d|Kerokero}}) which eventually evolved into a [[Greninja]]. She also attempts to befriend an Eevee, and she nicknames it {{nihongo4|Veevee|\u3076\u3044\u3076\u3044|Buibui}}. Veevee later evolves into a Sylveon during their first encounter with Team Flare. Y later obtains the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Xerneas for her team, nicknaming it Xerxer, as well as Absol which can Mega Evolve, nicknaming it SolSol. During the final battle, Xerxer is lost when it reverted into a tree. At the end of the arc, she rests for her next semester at Sky Trainer Academy.\n\nY is designed after Serena from [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']].\n\n===Alola Pok\u00e9dex Holders===\n*{{nihongo4|'''Sun'''|\u30b5\u30f3|San}} is one of the main characters of the Sun and Moon arc. He moved to Alola from the Kanto region. He is currently in debt 100 billion [[Yen]] for a yet to be known reason. Hence, he has many jobs and carries many packages to be delivered. He has been known by the nickname \"The Courier\". Sun has a [[Meowth]] in Alolan form nicknamed Cent ({{nihongo4|\u30c0\u30e9\u30fc|Dar\u0101}}) and a [[Litten]] nicknamed Dollar ({{nihongo4|\u30a8\u30f3|En}}) that he got from Professor Kukui, and a Wishiwashi nicknamed Quarter ({{nihongo4|\u30d0\u30fc\u30c4|B\u0101tsu}}) was join after defeating the Totem at Brooklet Hill.\n\nSun is designed after the male player, Elio from [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']].\n\n*{{nihongo4|'''Moon'''|\u30e0\u30fc\u30f3|M\u016bn}} is one of the main characters of the Sun and Moon arc. She moved to Alola from Sinnoh region. She is a professional [[Archery|archer]] and skilled [[Pharmacy|pharmacist]]. She was sent a Rotom to make the Rotom Pok\u00e9dex.\n\nMoon is designed after the female player, Selene from [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']].\n\n===Galar Pok\u00e9dex holders===\n*{{nihongo4|'''Sword Tsurugi'''|\u5263 \u5275\u4eba|Tsurugi S\u014ddo}} is a boy from Galar.\n\n*{{nihongo4|'''Shieldmilia Tate'''|\u76fe\u30fb\u30b7\u30eb\u30c9\u30df\u30ea\u30a2|Tate Shirudomiria, Tate means \"shield\"}} is a girl from Galar.\n\n==Antagonists==\n\n===Team Rocket===\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, Team Rocket has their own mnemonic for the word \"Rocket\": \"'''R'''aid '''O'''n the '''C'''ity, '''K'''nock out... '''E'''vil '''T'''usks\". Three Gym Leaders - Lt. Surge, Sabrina and Koga - serve directly under the first incarnation of Team Rocket. A fourth Gym Leader, Blaine, used to work for Team Rocket as their scientist, but now joins the alliance of Kanto Gym Leaders not affiliated with Team Rocket (Brock, Misty and Erika).\n\nThe first incarnation of [[Team Rocket]] is led by Giovanni - the Gym Leader of Viridian City and deputised by three high-profile members of Team Rocket - Ken, Al and Harry, which proclaim themselves as an \"Elite Trio\". They aim to exploit Pok\u00e9mon and conquer the world.\n\nCarr, Orm and Sird are the deputies of the second incarnation of Team Rocket, exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Adventures. They call themselves the Three Beasts. Carr reacted angrily when he found out that Giovanni was searching for his son, and thus tried to wrestle control of Team Rocket. He also attempted to revive Team Rocket at the start of the ''HeartGold & SoulSilver'' arc, but was stopped by the Four Generals, who claimed that those who do not follow Giovanni's ideal were not truly representative of Team Rocket. It was also revealed that Sird was originally a founding member of Team Galactic, who pretended to be loyal to Team Rocket but was in fact meant to capture Deoxys for Team Galactic. Before \"joining\" Team Rocket, she came across the weakened Maxie and Archie and presented a sword and armor to the winner of a fight to the death between Maxie and Archie. Due to an ankle injury sustained on her escape from Kanto, Sird assumed control of a Team Galactic grunt's body and continued operations using his body.\n\n===Neo Team Rocket===\nPryce, the Gym Leader of Mahogany Town, leads the first incarnation of Neo Team Rocket under a masked disguise called Mask of Ice. In the past, he captured Ho-Oh and used it to recruit six talented youngsters that would help him achieve his goal of travelling through time. Carl and Sham were based on the designs of the Neo Rocket Executives in ''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Pok\u00e9mon Silver''. Will and Karen, like Carl and Sham, were loyal to Pryce (and thus saw his face behind the mask) but after Pryce's disappearance, formed a new Elite Four with ex-Team Rocket deputy Koga and former Elite Four member Bruno. Finally, Green and Silver, who were kidnapped by Pryce and thus never saw his face, escaped from Pryce when they had the chance, becoming recognized Pok\u00e9dex holders that contributed to Pryce's defeat in the voids of time.\n\nThe second incarnation of Neo Team Rocket, led by Archer, Ariana, Proton and Petrel, who are collectively named as the Four Generals, appears in the ''HeartGold & SoulSilver'' arc. They aimed to control Arceus, the deity of Pok\u00e9mon, in order to convince their former leader Giovanni to return. They achieved this by fooling the arc's main protagonists (Gold, Silver and Crystal) into helping them. Arceus created the creation trio of Dialga, Palkia and Giratina, and all appeared to be ready for Giovanni's return. Giovanni did indeed return, but with Lance and Pryce, both of which were antagonists of previous arcs, and worked together with the three main protagonists to stop the creation trio from destroying the world.\n\n===Team Aqua and Team Magma===\n[[Team Aqua]] and [[Team Magma]] are the criminal entities based in [[Hoenn]]. Led by Archie and Maxie respectively, the two teams are portrayed very differently in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures. Team Aqua is the more established organization that aims to expand the sea; its leader is even the boss of a television station, thus allowing Team Aqua to cover up their actions, including the ending of volcanic activity at Mt. Chimney. Team Magma is the smaller, more disjointed organization that aims to expand the land, but often has little sense of direction. During the climax of the ''Ruby & Sapphire'' arc, the two leaders strike a deal to reach the bottom of the sea together. They later assume control of the Blue Orb and Red Orb respectively. However, Archie and Maxie lose control of the orbs, which sink into their bodies. Kyogre and Groudon eventually reach Sootopolis City and start clashing once again. Even after the orbs are knocked out of Archie and Maxie's bodies, the clash continues, and after the clash is stopped, Archie and Maxie re-emerge with greater wickedness and savagery in their minds, and announce their intention to crush anyone that dares to defy them.\n\nIn the ''Emerald'' arc, Guile Hideout's real identity was revealed as Archie. He was the one who had won the sword and armor from Sird, having beaten Maxie in a fight to the death, and managed to summon a giant Kyogre-like monster to expand the sea, but ultimately disappeared in a flash of light after losing his armour, as well as control of the Battle Frontier's rental Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n===Team Galactic===\n[[Team Galactic]] is the criminal entity based in [[Sinnoh]]. Their aim of creating a new world had been planned for several years. At the end of the ''Diamond & Pearl'' arc, their leader Cyrus, who had been defeated by Diamond, Pearl and Platinum, is dragged into the Distortion World. In the ''Platinum'' arc, Team Galactic's scientist Charon becomes the new leader of the team, although the commanders - Mars, Jupiter and Saturn - still regarded Cyrus as their true boss, and tried to find him. In the Distortion World, Cyrus realized that his efforts to create a new world was all in vain - he only ended up creating a portal to the Distortion World. After Charon is ultimately stopped, Cyrus announced the disbandment of Team Galactic.\n\n===Team Plasma===\n[[Team Plasma]] is the criminal entity based in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White#Setting|Unova]]. The lesser members of the organization believe that N, a mysterious green-haired man, is their leader, and idolize him like a king. However, in truth N was brainwashed by Ghetsis, the true mastermind behind Team Plasma, whose aim is not to liberate Pok\u00e9mon, but make all the Pok\u00e9mon Team Plasma.\n\n===Neo Team Plasma===\nNeo Team Plasma is the new criminal entity based in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2#Setting|Unova]]. They aim to rule Unova by freezing the region. They are led by Ghetsis, and surrogate led by Colress.\n\n===Team Flare===\n[[Team Flare]] is the main evil organization of the [[Kalos]] region. They already appear to have a major influence over Kalos by owning the region's central media outlets to cover up their work. They seek to use X's Mega Ring to succeed in their plans, as well as seeking out [[Xerneas]] and [[Yveltal]]. Members include the leader Lysandre, scientists Xerosic, Aliana, Bryony, Celosia and Mable, newsreader Malva and butler Chalmers.\n\n===Team Skull/Aether Foundation===\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Video games|Anime and manga}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Pok\u00e9mon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pokemon Adventures Protagonists}}\n[[Category:Lists of Pok\u00e9mon characters|Adventures protagonists]]\n", "name_user": "Lord Opeth", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:replaced template", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures_characters"}

Medievalists note that Tolkien based Wormtongue on the untrustworthy character [[Unferth]] in ''[[Beowulf]]''.

His schemes were foiled when Gandalf the White and his companions arrived at Edoras, and convinced the king that he was not as weak as his adviser had made him seem. Upon Th\u00e9oden's restoration, \"many things which men had missed\" were found locked in Gr\u00edma's trunk, including the king's sword, [[Herugrim]]. Th\u00e9oden decided to go forth to battle at the Fords of Isen, and Gr\u00edma was given a choice: prove his loyalty and ride into battle with the king, or ride into exile.<ref name=\"hall\" group=T/> Choosing the latter, he went to Saruman at [[Orthanc]]. Following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, Gr\u00edma mistakenly threw the ''[[palant\u00edr]]'' of [[Orthanc]] at the [[Rohan (Middle-earth)#People|Rohirrim]] accompanying Gandalf, or possibly at Saruman himself, and so permitted its capture by [[Peregrin Took]].<ref name=\"voice\" group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 3, ch. 10 \"The Voice of Saruman\"</ref>\n\n===''The Return of the King''===\n{{further|The Scouring of the Shire}}\n\nGr\u00edma accompanied Saruman to the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], where Saruman sought revenge for his defeat at Orthanc in petty tyranny over the [[Hobbit]]s. During this time, Saruman shortened Gr\u00edma's nickname to \"Worm\". When Saruman was [[The Scouring of the Shire|overthrown by a hobbit rebellion]] and ordered to leave, [[Frodo Baggins]] implored Gr\u00edma not to follow him, and even offered him food and shelter. Saruman countered by revealing to the Hobbits that Gr\u00edma had murdered and possibly eaten Lotho Sackville-Baggins, a kinsman of Frodo; whereupon Gr\u00edma killed [[Saruman]] and was shot by Hobbit archers.<ref name=\"scouring\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 7 \"The Scouring of the Shire\"</ref>\n\n===''Unfinished Tales''===\n\nGr\u00edma played a major role in the back-story to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', prior to his first appearance in ''The Two Towers''. In ''Unfinished Tales'' Tolkien writes that Gr\u00edma was captured by the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] in the [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|fields of the Rohirrim]], while on his way to [[Isengard]] to inform Saruman of Gandalf's arrival at [[Edoras]]. He divulged what he knew of Saruman's plans to the Nazg\u00fbl, specifically his interest in the Shire, and its location. Gr\u00edma was set free, and the Nazg\u00fbl set out immediately for the Shire. In another version within the same chapter, this role is given to the ''squint-eyed southerner'' that the hobbits encounter at [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]].<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 3, ch. 4 \"The Hunt for the Ring\"</ref> Tolkien further suggests that Gr\u00edma may have given Th\u00e9oden \"subtle poisons\" that caused him to age at an accelerated pace.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 3, ch. 5 \"The Battles of the Fords of Isen\"</ref>\n\n==Interpretations==\n\nTo psychologists, Wormtongue serves as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[sycophant]], flatterer, liar, and manipulator.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sycophancy in Middle Earth |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/sucking/201712/sycophancy-in-middle-earth |last1=Parker |first1=Deborah |last2=Parker |first2=Mark |date=1 December 2017 |website=[[Psychology Today]]}}</ref> \n\nTolkien scholars have noted that Wormtongue's interaction with Gandalf in [[Meduseld]] has an Old English counterpart in the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'': the account is closely based on the hero Beowulf's dealings with [[Unferth]] in [[Heorot]], where Unferth is King [[Hrothgar]]'s \"ambiguous\"<ref name=\"H&S\"/> spokesman; Unferth is thoroughly discredited by Beowulf, as Wormtongue is by Gandalf.<ref name=\"H&S\">{{cite book |last1=Hammond |first1=Wayne G. |author1link=Wayne G.

Medievalists note that Tolkien based Wormtongue on the untrustworthy character [[Unferth]] in ''[[Beowulf]]''.

His schemes were foiled when Gandalf the White and his companions arrived at Edoras, and convinced the king that he was not as weak as his adviser had made him seem. Upon Th\u00e9oden's restoration, \"many things which men had missed\" were found locked in Gr\u00edma's trunk, including the king's sword, [[Herugrim]]. Th\u00e9oden decided to go forth to battle at the Fords of Isen, and Gr\u00edma was given a choice: prove his loyalty and ride into battle with the king, or ride into exile.<ref name=\"hall\" group=T/> Choosing the latter, he went to Saruman at [[Orthanc]]. Following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, Gr\u00edma mistakenly threw the ''[[palant\u00edr]]'' of [[Orthanc]] at the [[Rohan (Middle-earth)#People|Rohirrim]] accompanying Gandalf, or possibly at Saruman himself, and so permitted its capture by [[Peregrin Took]].<ref name=\"voice\" group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 3, ch. 10 \"The Voice of Saruman\"</ref>\n\n===''The Return of the King''===\n{{further|The Scouring of the Shire}}\n\nGr\u00edma accompanied Saruman to the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], where Saruman sought revenge for his defeat at Orthanc in petty tyranny over the [[Hobbit]]s.

When Saruman was [[The Scouring of the Shire|overthrown by a hobbit rebellion]] and ordered to leave, [[Frodo Baggins]] implored Gr\u00edma not to follow him, and even offered him food and shelter. Saruman countered by revealing to the Hobbits that Gr\u00edma had murdered and possibly eaten Lotho Sackville-Baggins, a kinsman of Frodo; whereupon Gr\u00edma killed [[Saruman]] and was shot by Hobbit archers.<ref name=\"scouring\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 7 \"The Scouring of the Shire\"</ref>\n\n===''Unfinished Tales''===\n\nGr\u00edma played a major role in the back-story to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', prior to his first appearance in ''The Two Towers''. In ''Unfinished Tales'' Tolkien writes that Gr\u00edma was captured by the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] in the [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|fields of the Rohirrim]], while on his way to [[Isengard]] to inform Saruman of Gandalf's arrival at [[Edoras]]. He divulged what he knew of Saruman's plans to the Nazg\u00fbl, specifically his interest in the Shire, and its location. Gr\u00edma was set free, and the Nazg\u00fbl set out immediately for the Shire. In another version within the same chapter, this role is given to the ''squint-eyed southerner'' that the hobbits encounter at [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]].<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 3, ch. 4 \"The Hunt for the Ring\"}}</ref> Tolkien further suggests that Gr\u00edma may have given Th\u00e9oden \"subtle poisons\" that caused him to age at an accelerated pace.<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', part 3, ch. 5 \"The Battles of the Fords of Isen\"}}</ref>\n\n==Interpretations==\n\nTo psychologists, Wormtongue serves as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[sycophant]], flatterer, liar, and manipulator.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sycophancy in Middle Earth |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/sucking/201712/sycophancy-in-middle-earth |last1=Parker |first1=Deborah |last2=Parker |first2=Mark |date=1 December 2017 |website=[[Psychology Today]]}}</ref> \n\nTolkien scholars have noted that Wormtongue's interaction with Gandalf in [[Meduseld]] has an Old English counterpart in the epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'': the account is closely based on the hero Beowulf's dealings with [[Unferth]] in [[Heorot]], where Unferth is King [[Hrothgar]]'s \"ambiguous\"<ref name=\"H&S\"/> spokesman; Unferth is thoroughly discredited by Beowulf, as Wormtongue is by Gandalf.<ref name=\"H&S\">{{cite book |last1=Hammond |first1=Wayne G. |author1link=Wayne G.
