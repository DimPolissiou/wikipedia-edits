'''monarchy of Australia''' concerns the form of government in which a [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary]] king or queen serves as the nation's [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and [[head of state]]. [[Australia]] is governed under a form of [[constitutional monarchy]], largely modelled on the [[Westminster system]] of [[parliamentary government]], while incorporating features unique to the [[Constitution of Australia]]. The present monarch is [[Elizabeth II]], [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] ''Queen of Australia'',<ref name=\"Titles Act 1973\"/> who has [[Queen regnant|reigned]] since 6 February 1952.

The future of the monarchy has been a recurring topic of public discussion.\n\n==International and domestic aspects==\n:''Further information: [[Commonwealth realm#The Crown in the Commonwealth realms|Commonwealth realm: The Crown in the Commonwealth realms]]''\nKey features of Australia's system of government include its basis on a combination of \"written\" and \"unwritten rules\", and its retention of colonial-monarchical heads of state, comprising the British monarch and what had been the monarch's colonial representatives, the State Governors, together with the Governor-General.<ref name=\"Australia 2013. p.12\">''Government and Politics in Australia'', 10th edition, by Alan Fenna and others, P.Ed Australia, 2013.

Initially the detective he chooses is Rajasekar Kayal's dad. Kamal doesn't know Kayal's name, but he says about all her fake boyfriends. Rajasekar realizes that the girl's boyfriends' names are same as the names of the people in his case files realizes that Kamal is actually inquiring about his daughter, Kayal as only she has seen them. He tells Kamal about it and asks him to leave his daughter as he always does when someone falls in love with him. Kamal agrees and tells Kayal that he will be leaving for Germany and that he doesn't know when he will return. Kayal is heartbroken.

Kamal leaves Paris for some board meetings and Kayal is heart broken. When he returns he doesn't remember her immediately even though she has been waiting for him. Kayal tries to make Kamal love her by pretending to have many boyfriends. Kamal does get a bit jealous and he decides to get a detective to know everything about her and her possible boyfriends. Initially the detective he chooses is Rajasekar Kayal's dad. Kamal doesn't know Kayal's name, but he says about all her fake boyfriends. Rajasekar realises that the girl's boyfriends' names are same as the names of the people in his case files realises that Kamal is actually inquiring about his daughter, Kayal as only she has seen them. He tells Kamal about it and asks him to leave his daughter as he always does when someone falls in love with him. Kamal agrees and tells Kayal that he will be leaving for Germany and that he doesn't know when he will return. Kayal is heartbroken. Kamal tries to forget her but find that he cannot as he realises that he too loves her. So he returns to Paris and finds her. But Kayal is angry with him and walks away. Kamal runs after her saying that he is in love with her and will never leave her and they will be together thereafter.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jayam Ravi]] as Kamal\n* [[Hansika Motwani]] as Kayalvizhi\n* [[Suman (actor)|Suman]] as Rajasekhar\n* [[Raju Sundaram]] as Raju\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Rajasekhar's client\n* Marion Arnaud\n* Aur\u00e9lien Chevallier\n* [[Uma Padmanabhan]] as Kamal's mother (Cameo Appearance)\n* [[Prakash Raj]] in a Cameo Appearance\n* [[Prabhu Deva]] in a special appearance in song \"Engeyum Kadhal\"\n\n==Production==\n[[Prabhu Deva]] initially named this film as ''Paris''.

They included the inhabitants of [[Ancient Carthage]] (modern [[Tunis]]), as well as those of the settlements that acknowledged Carthaginian leadership elsewhere in [[North Africa]], western [[Sicily]], southern [[Sardinia]], [[Malta]], [[Ebusus]], and southern [[Spain]]. Their language, [[Punic language|Punic]], was a dialect of [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]].<ref name=\"Mackay2004\">{{cite book|author=Christopher S.

Although links with Phoenicia were retained throughout their history, they also developed close relations with other peoples of the western Mediterranean and developed cultural traits distinct from those of the Phoenician motherland. Some of these were shared by all western Phoenicians, while others were restricted to individual regions within the Punic sphere. \n\nThe western Phoenicians were arranged into a multitude of self-governing city-states. [[Carthage]] had grown to be the largest and most powerful of these city-states by the fifth century BC and gained increasingly close control over Punic Sicily and Sardinia in the fourth century BC, but other communities remained outside their control. In the course of the [[Punic wars]] (264-146 BC), the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s challenged Carthaginian hegemony in the western Mediterranean, culminating in the destruction of Carthage in 146 BC, but the Punic language and Punic culture endured under Roman rule, surviving in some places until [[Late Antiquity]].\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Sicily, Greece, 4th century BC - Tetradrachm- Persephone (reverse) - 1917.980.b - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|thumb|A Carthaginian coin from Sicily depicting a horse in front of a palm tree (called ''Phoinix'' in Greek), fourth century BC.]]\nThe English adjective ''Punic'' is used in modern scholarship exclusively to refer to the Western Phoenicians. The [[proper noun]]s ''Punics'' and ''Punes'' were used in the sixteenth century, but are obsolete and in current usage there is no proper noun. ''Punic'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:poenus|poenus]]'' and ''[[wikt:punicus|punicus]]'', which were used mostly to refer to the Carthaginians and other western Phoenicians. These terms derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word \u03a6\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b9\u03be (''Phoinix''), pl. \u03a6\u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 (''Phoinikes''), which was used indiscriminately to refer to both western and eastern Phoenicians. Latin later borrowed the Greek term a second time as ''phoenix'', pl. ''phoenices'', also used indiscriminately.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Prag |first1=Jonathan R. W. |title=Poenus Plane Est - but Who Were the \u201cPunickes\u201d? |journal=Papers of the British School at Rome |date=2006 |volume=74 |pages=1\u201337}}</ref> \n\nNumismatic evidence from Sicily shows that some western Phoenicians made use of the term ''Phoinix'',<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jenkins |first1=G. Kenneth |title=Coins of Punic Sicily, Part II |journal=Schweizerische Numismatische Rundschau |date=1974 |volume=53 |pages=27-29}}</ref> but it is not clear what term (if any) they used for themselves. A passage from [[Augustine]] has often been interpreted as indicating that they called themselves ''Chanani'' ([[Canaanites]]),<ref>[[Augustine]] ''Unfinished Commentary on Paul's Letter to the Romans'' 13</ref> but it has recently been argued that this is a misreading.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Quinn |first1=Josephine Crawley |title=In Search of the Phoenicians |date=2019 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691195964 |pages=33-35}}</ref>\n\nIn modern scholarship, the term 'Punic' is exclusively used to refer to Phoenicians in the Western Mediterranean. Specific Punic groups are often referred to with hyphenated terms, like 'Siculo-Punic' or 'Sardo-Punic'. This practice has ancient roots: [[Hellenistic]] Greek authors sometimes referred to the Punic inhabitants of North Africa ('Libya') as 'Liby-Phoenicians'.\n\n==Overview==\nLike other Phoenician people, their urbanized culture and economy were strongly linked to the sea. Overseas, they established control over some coastal regions of [[Maghreb|Berber Northwest Africa]] in what is now Tunisia and [[Libya]] as well as [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]], [[Ebusus]], [[Malta]] and other small islands of the western Mediterranean. \nIn Sardinia and Sicily, they had strong economic and political ties to the independent natives in the hinterland. Their naval presence and trade extended throughout the Mediterranean and beyond, to Atlantic Iberia, the [[British Isles]], the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], and [[West Africa]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1EEtmT9Tbj4C&pg=PA17&dq=The+Phoenicians,+2001#v=onepage&q=British%20Isles&f=false The Phoenicians] retrieved 12 October 2009</ref>\n\nTechnical achievements of the Punic people of Carthage include the [[Glass#History|development of uncolored glass]] and the use of [[lake|lacustrine]] [[limestone]] to improve the purity of [[smelting| iron]].\n\nMost of the Punic culture was destroyed as a result of the [[Punic Wars]] fought between [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], from 264 to 146 BC,<ref>Chris Scarre, \"The Wars with Carthage\", ''The Manawy Historical Atlas of Ancient Rome'' (London: Penguin Books, 1995), 24\u201325.</ref> but traces of language, religion and technology could still be found in Africa during the [[early Christianity#Spread of Christianity|early Christianisation]], from AD 325 to 650. After the Punic Wars, Romans used the term ''Punic'' as an adjective meaning ''treacherous''.\n\n==Origins and colonisation==\n==Distribution==\n===Tunisia===\nTunisia was among the areas settled during the first wave of Phoenician expansion into the west, with the foundation of [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Hippo Regius]] taking place around the end of the twelfth century.{{sfn|Dridi|2019|p=141}} Further Phoenician settlements, were established in the following centuries, including [[Bizerte|Hippo Diarrhytus]] and [[Hadrumetum]]. \n\nThe foundation of [[Carthage]] on the site of modern [[Tunis]] is dated to the late ninth century BC by Greek literary sources and archaeological evidence. The literary sources attribute the foundation to a group of Tyrian refugees led by [[Dido]] and accompanied by [[Cyprus|Cypriots]]. Archaeologically, the new foundation is characterised by the focus of religious cult on the gods [[Tanit]] and [[Baal Hammon]], by the development of a new religious structure, the [[tophet]], and by a marked degree of cosmopolitanism.{{sfn|Dridi|2019|p=142-146}} \n\nCarthage gained direct control over the [[Cap Bon]] peninsula, operating a sandstone quarry at [[El Haouaria]] from the middle of the seventh city and establishing the city of [[Kerkouane]] in the early sixth century.{{sfn|Dridi|2019|p=147-150}} The region was very fertile and allowed Carthage to be economically self-sufficient.{{sfn|Hoyos|2019|p=158-159}} The site of Kerkouane has been extensively excavated and provides the best-known example of a Punic city from North Africa.\n\nPunic control was also extended inland over the [[Libyans]]. Punic influence on inland regions is seen from the early sixth century, notably at [[Althiburos]], where Punic construction techniques and red-slip pottery appear at this time.{{sfn|Dridi|2019|p=147-150}} Armed conflicts with the Libyans are first attested in the early fifth century, with several revolts attested in the fourth century (398, 370s, 310-307 BC). In the late fourth century, [[Aristotle]] reports that the Carthaginians dealt with local discontent by resettling poor citizens in cities in Libya.<ref>[[Aristotle]], ''Politics'' 2.1273b: 19-20</ref>{{sfn|Hoyos|2019|p=157-159}} These settlements had to provide tribute and military manpower when required, but remained self-governing. There is some [[onomastic]] evidence for intermarriage between Punic people and Libyans in the fourth and third centuries BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2019|p=160}}\n\n<!--In the second half of the sixth century, Carthaginian interventions are attested overseas throughout the [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]], but this influence was sporadic and did not amount to imperial control.{{sfn|Dridi|2019|p=147-150}}\n\n===Sicily===-->\n\n===Sardo-Punics===\n[[File:Colonne a tharros.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Ruins of the Punic and then Roman town of [[Tharros]]]]\nFrom the 8th century BC, Phoenicians founded several cities and strongholds on strategic points in the south and west of Sardinia, often peninsulas or islands near estuaries, easy to defend and natural harbours, such as [[Tharros]], [[Bithia, Italy|Bithia]], [[Sulci]], [[Nora, Italy|Nora]] and Caralis ([[Cagliari]]). The north, the eastern coast and the interior of the island continued to be dominated by the indigenous [[Nuragic civilization]], whose relations with the Sardo-Punic cities were mixed, including both trade and military conflict. Intermarriage and cultural mixing took place on a large scale. The inhabitants of the Sardo-Punic cities were a mixture of Phoenician and Nuragic stock, with the latter forming the majority of the population.{{sfn|Brigaglia|Mastino|Ortu|2006|p=25}}<ref>{{cite book|author = Piero Bartoloni|title = Monte Sirai|pages = 38\u201339|publisher = Carlo Delfino Editore|year = 2004|url= http://www.sardegnacultura.it/documenti/7_4_20060402094934.pdf|accessdate = 28 October 2016\n}}</ref> Sardinia had a special position because it was central in the Western Mediterranean between Carthage, Spain, the river [[Rh\u00f4ne]] and the [[Etruscan civilization]] area.

The existing power structures, infrastructure, and urbanized culture continued largely unchanged. In 216 BC, two Sardo-Punic notables from [[Cornus, Sardinia|Cornus]] and Tharros, [[Hampsicora]] and Hanno, led a revolt against the Romans.{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=104}} Punic culture remained strong during the first centuries of the Roman domination, but over time the civic elites adopted Roman cultural practices and  [[Latin]] became first the [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige language]] and then the speech of the majority of the inhabitants.{{sfn|Casula|1994|p=110}}\n<!--===Spain===\n\n===Malta===-->\n\n===Ibiza===\nThe island of Ibiza derives its name from {{lang-phn|\ud802\udd00\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd14\ud802\udd0c}}, {{sc|\u02beb\u0161m}},{{sfnp|Head & al.|1911|p=3}} \"Dedicated to [[Bes]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liveibiza.com/ibiza_literature/god_bes_ibiza.htm |title=Ibiza Literature, Literature in Ibiza |publisher=Liveibiza.com |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref><ref name=\"Kuhbier\">{{Cite book|editor1=Kuhbier, Heinrich |editor2=Alcover, Josep Antoni |editor3=Guerau d'Arellano Tur, Crist\u00f2fol |year=1984 |title=Biogeography and Ecology of the Pityusic Islands |series=Monographiae Biologicae, Volume 52 |location=The Hague, The Netherlands |publisher=Dr. W.

Although links with Phoenicia were retained throughout their history, they also developed close relations with other peoples of the western Mediterranean and developed cultural traits distinct from those of the Phoenician motherland. Some of these were shared by all western Phoenicians, while others were restricted to individual regions within the Punic sphere. \n\nThe western Phoenicians were arranged into a multitude of self-governing city-states. [[Carthage]] had grown to be the largest and most powerful of these city-states by the fifth century BC and gained increasingly close control over Punic Sicily and Sardinia in the fourth century BC, but other communities remained outside their control. In the course of the [[Punic wars]] (264-146 BC), the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s challenged Carthaginian hegemony in the western Mediterranean, culminating in the destruction of Carthage in 146 BC, but the Punic language and Punic culture endured under Roman rule, surviving in some places until [[Late Antiquity]].\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Sicily, Greece, 4th century BC - Tetradrachm- Persephone (reverse) - 1917.980.b - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|thumb|A Carthaginian coin from Sicily depicting a horse in front of a palm tree (called ''Phoinix'' in Greek), fourth century BC.]]\nThe English adjective ''Punic'' is used in modern scholarship exclusively to refer to the Western Phoenicians. The [[proper noun]]s ''Punics'' and ''Punes'' were used in the sixteenth century, but are obsolete and in current usage there is no proper noun. ''Punic'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:poenus|poenus]]'' and ''[[wikt:punicus|punicus]]'', which were used mostly to refer to the Carthaginians and other western Phoenicians. These terms derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word \u03a6\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b9\u03be (''Phoinix''), pl. \u03a6\u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 (''Phoinikes''), which was used indiscriminately to refer to both western and eastern Phoenicians.

Specific Punic groups are often referred to with hyphenated terms, like 'Siculo-Punic' or 'Sardo-Punic'. This practice has ancient roots: [[Hellenistic]] Greek authors sometimes referred to the Punic inhabitants of North Africa ('Libya') as 'Liby-Phoenicians'.\n\n==Overview==\nLike other Phoenician people, their urbanized culture and economy were strongly linked to the sea. Overseas, they established control over some coastal regions of [[Maghreb|Berber Northwest Africa]] in what is now Tunisia and [[Libya]] as well as [[Sardinia]], [[Sicily]], [[Ebusus]], [[Malta]] and other small islands of the western Mediterranean. \nIn Sardinia and Sicily, they had strong economic and political ties to the independent natives in the hinterland.

The literary sources attribute the foundation to a group of Tyrian refugees led by [[Dido]] and accompanied by [[Cyprus|Cypriots]]. Archaeologically, the new foundation is characterised by the focus of religious cult on the gods [[Tanit]] and [[Baal Hammon]], by the development of a new religious structure, the [[tophet]], and by a marked degree of cosmopolitanism.{{sfn|Dridi|2019|p=142-146}} \n\nCarthage gained direct control over the [[Cap Bon]] peninsula, operating a sandstone quarry at [[El Haouaria]] from the middle of the seventh city and establishing the city of [[Kerkouane]] in the early sixth century.{{sfn|Dridi|2019|p=147-150}} The region was very fertile and allowed Carthage to be economically self-sufficient.{{sfn|Hoyos|2019|p=158-159}} The site of Kerkouane has been extensively excavated and provides the best-known example of a Punic city from North Africa.\n\nPunic control was also extended inland over the [[Libyans]].
