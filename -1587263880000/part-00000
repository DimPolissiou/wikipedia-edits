Swift promoted the album by performing as the opening act, for the tours by artists such as [[Rascal Flatts]], [[George Strait]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Tim McGraw]] and [[Faith Hill]].\n\n''Taylor Swift'' received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised Swift's talent at such a young age.

Swift was 16 years old at the time of the album's release and wrote its songs during her [[freshman year]] of high school. Swift has writing credits on all of the album's songs, including those co-written with [[Liz Rose]]. Swift experimented with several [[record producer|producers]], ultimately choosing [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], who had produced her [[demo album]].''Taylor Swift'' is a [[Country music|country]] album, with some tracks having [[Pop music|pop]] and [[pop rock]] sensibilities. Lyrically, the album speaks of romantic relationships, a couple of which Swift wrote from observing them before being in one. It also touches on Swift's friends and her personal struggles in [[high school]]. \n\nFive singles were released from ''Taylor Swift''; all  reached the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and has been [[Music recording sales certification|certified platinum or multi-platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Swift's debut single and the album's lead single \"[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]]\" peaked at number six on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs]] chart. \"[[Teardrops on My Guitar]]\" was the album's best-performing song on the Hot 100, spending 48 weeks on the chart and becoming Swift's first top 20 hit. The third single \"[[Our Song (Taylor Swift song)|Our Song]]\" made Swift the youngest person in history to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart; \"[[Picture to Burn]]\" peaked at number three on the chart, while \"[[Should've Said No]]\" became the second single from the album to top the chart. Swift promoted the album by performing as the opening act, for the tours by artists such as [[Rascal Flatts]], [[George Strait]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Tim McGraw]] and [[Faith Hill]].\n\n''Taylor Swift'' received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised Swift's talent at such a young age. The album enjoyed commercial success and launched Swift's career in country music. In the United States, it topped the [[Top Country Albums|''Billboard'' Top Country Albums]] Chart for 24 weeks, and was certified [[RIAA certifications|7\u00d7 platinum]] by the RIAA for selling over seven million copies. ''Taylor Swift'' was the longest-charting album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] of the 2000s decade, remaining on the chart for 275 weeks in total. The album was also certified gold in [[British Phonographic Industry|the United Kingdom]], and platinum in [[Australian Recording Industry Association|Australia]] and [[Music Canada|Canada]].\n\n==Background==\nSwift is from [[Reading, Pennsylvania]] and developed an early interest in [[country music]] and [[songwriting]].<ref name=\"allbio\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=mn0000472102| tab=biography |pure_url=yes}}|title=Taylor Swift > Biography & History|publisher=[[AllMusic]].

{"title_page": "Virtual community", "text_new": "{{otheruses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}\n{{Essay-like|article|date=March 2011}}\nA '''virtual community''' is a [[social network]] of individuals who connect through specific [[social media]], potentially crossing geographical and political boundaries in order to pursue mutual interests or goals. Some of the most pervasive virtual communities are [[online community|online communities]] operating under [[social networking service]]s.\n\n[[Howard Rheingold]] discussed virtual communities in his book, ''[[The Virtual Community (book)|The Virtual Community]]'', published in 1993. The book's discussion ranges from Rheingold's adventures on [[The WELL]], [[computer-mediated communication]] and social groups and information science. Technologies cited include [[Usenet]], [[MUD]]s (Multi-User Dungeon) and their derivatives [[MUSH]]es and [[MOO]]s, [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[chat room]]s and [[electronic mailing list]]s. Rheingold also points out the potential benefits for personal psychological well-being, as well as for society at large, of belonging to a virtual community.\n\nVirtual communities all encourage interaction, sometimes focusing around a particular interest or just to communicate. Some virtual communities do both. Community members are allowed to interact over a shared passion through various means: message boards, chat rooms, social networking World Wide Web sites, or virtual worlds.<ref>Hof, R. D., Browder, S., Elstrom, P. (5 May 1997). Internet Communities. Business Week.</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nThe traditional definition of a community is of geographically circumscribed entity (neighborhoods, villages, etc.).  Virtual communities are usually dispersed geographically, and therefore are not communities under the original definition. Some online communities are linked geographically, and are known as community websites. However, if one considers communities to simply possess boundaries of some sort between their members and non-members, then a virtual community is certainly a community.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\">Pears, Iain. 1998. An Instance of the Fingerpost. London: Jonathan Cape.\n</ref> Virtual communities resemble real life ''[[communities]]'' in the sense that they both provide support, information, friendship and acceptance between strangers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wellman |first=B |year=1999 |title= Networks in the global village: life in contemporary communities |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vhuOBRPS-pUC&pg=PA331&dq=impacts+of+virtual+communities#v=snippet&q=belonging&f=false |isbn=9780813368214 }}</ref>\n\nEarly research into the existence of media-based communities was concerned with the nature of [[virtual reality|reality]], whether communities actually could exist through the media, which could place virtual community research into the social sciences definition of ontology. In the seventeenth century, scholars associated with the [[Royal Society]] of London formed a community through the exchange of letters.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\"/> \"Community without propinquity\", coined by urban planner [[Melvin Webber]] in 1963 and \"community liberated\", analyzed by [[Barry Wellman]] in 1979 began the modern era of thinking about non-local community.<ref>Webber, Melvin. 1963. \"Order in Diversity: Community without Propinquity.\" Pp. 23\u201354 in Cities and Space: The Future Use of Urban Land, edited by J.

For example, an email distribution list could serve as a personal means of communicating with family and friends, and also formally to coordinate with coworkers.\n\n=== User Experience Testing to Determine Social Codes ===\n[[User Experience]] is the ultimate goal for the program or software used by an internet community, because user experience will determine the software\u2019s success.<ref name=\"framework\">{{cite journal |last1=Sieckenius de Souza |first1=Clarisse |last2=Preece |first2=Jenny |title=A framework for analyzing and understanding online communities |journal=\u00a0Interacting with Computers |date=June 2004 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=579\u2013610}}</ref> The software for social media pages or virtual communities is structured around the users\u2019 experience and designed specifically for online use.\nUser experience testing is utilized to reveal something about the personal experience of the human being using a product or system.<ref name=\"Morgan Kaufmann\">{{cite book |last1=Tullis |first1=Thomas |last2=Albert |first2=William |title=Measuring the User Experience: Collecting, Analyzing, and Presenting Usability Metrics |date=2016 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-12-415781-1}}</ref> When it comes to testing user experience in a software interface, three main characteristics are needed: a user who is engaged, a user who is interacting with a product or interface, and defining the users\u2019 experience in ways that are and observable or measurable.<ref name=\"Morgan Kaufmann\" />\nUser experience metrics are based on a reliability and repeatability, using a consistent set of measurements to result in comparable outcomes. User experience metrics measure effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of an interface through quantifiable data collected during the testing process. \nThe widespread use of the Internet and virtual communities by millions of diverse users for socializing is a phenomenon that raises new issues for researchers and developers. The vast number and diversity of individuals participating in virtual communities worldwide makes it a challenge to test usability across platforms to ensure the best overall user experience.  Some well-established measures applied to the usability framework for online communities are speed of learning, productivity, user satisfaction, how much people remember using the software, and how many errors they make.<ref name=\"Preece\">{{cite journal |last1=Preece |first1=Jenny |title=Socialility and Usability in Online Communities: Determining and Measuring Success |journal=Behaviour & Information Technology |date=2001 |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=347\u2013356|doi=10.1080/01449290110084683 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/487c4156883c7042516a9bb1b9c1a27efa7302b6 }}</ref>\nThe human computer interactions that are measured during a usability experience test focus on the individuals rather than their social interactions in the online community. The success of an online community interface depends on the integration of usability and social semiotics. Social codes are established and reinforced by the regular repetition of behavioral patterns.<ref name=\"Semiotics\">{{cite book |last1=Chandler |first1=Daniel |title=Semiotics: The Basics |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, Oxon |edition=3}}</ref> People communicate their social identities or [[culture code]] through the work they do, the way they talk, the clothes they wear, their eating habits, domestic environments and possessions, and use of leisure time. Usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user\u2019s habits when interacting with a program. The amount of information provided during the usability test can determine demographic factors such as age, sex, or social status and help define the semiotic social code. \nDialogue and social interactions, support information design, navigation support, and accessibility are key components for good software usability.<ref name=\"Preece\" /> Efficient communication requires a common set of signs in the minds of those seeking to communicate.<ref name=\"Semiotics\" /> As technologies evolve and mature, they tend to be used by an increasingly diverse set of users.

However, studies regarding the health effects of these communities did not show any negative effects. There was a high drop-out rate of participants in the study. The health-related effects are not clear because of the lack of thoroughness and the variation in studies done on the subject.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Eysenbach |first=G |year=2004 |title= Health related virtual communities and electronic support groups: systematic review of the effects of online peer to peer interactions |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7449 |pages=1166 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/328/7449/1166.full|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7449.1166 |pmid=15142921 |pmc=411092 }}</ref>\n\nRather, recent studies have looked into development of health related communities and their impact on those already suffering health issues.

Online health communities can serve as supportive outlets as they facilitate connecting with others who truly understand the disease, as well as offer more practical support, such as receiving help in adjusting to life with the disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/04/04/135106113/patients-with-rare-diseases-connect-online |title=Web Communities Help Patients With Rare Diseases |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}</ref> Involvement in social communities of similar health interests has created a means for patients to develop a better understanding and behavior towards treatment and health practices.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Neal |first1=L. |last2=Lindgagarrd |first2=G. |last3=Oakley |first3=K. |last4=Hansen |first4=D. |last5=Kogan |first5=S. |last6= Leimeister |first6=J.M. |last7= Selker |first7=T. |year=2006 |title=  Online Health Communities.

Online health-focused communities were shown to offer a unique form of emotional support that differed from event-based realities and informational support networks. Growing amounts of presented material show how online communities affect the health of their users.

Networking sites act as a medium for expression and discourse about issues in specific user communities. Online content-sharing sites have made it easy for youth as well as others to not only express themselves and their ideas through digital media, but also connect with large networked communities. Within these spaces, young people are pushing the boundaries of traditional forms of engagement such as voting and joining political organizations and creating their own ways to discuss, connect, and act in their communities.<ref>{{cite web |last=Carvin |first=A. |date= 1 December 2006 |title= Understanding the impact of online communities on civic engagement |url=https://www.pbs.org/teachers/learning.now/2006/12/understanding_the_impact_of_on.html }}</ref>\n\nCivic engagement through [[online volunteering]] has shown to have positive effects on personal satisfaction and development. Some 84 percent of online volunteers found that their online volunteering experience had contributed to their personal development and learning.<ref>[http://www.unv.org/annual-report-2014/index.html UNV Annual Report 2014, Innovation and Knowledge]</ref>\n\n===On communication===\nIn his book [[The Wealth of Networks]] from 2006, Yochai Benkler suggests that virtual communities would \"come to represent a new form of human communal existence, providing new scope for building a shared experience of human interaction.\"<ref name=\"Benkler\">{{cite book |last=Benkler|first=Yochai|year=2006|title=The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom|url=http://www.benkler.org/Benkler_Wealth_Of_Networks_Chapter_10.pdf}}</ref> Although Benkler's prediction has not become entirely true, clearly communications and social relations are extremely complex within a virtual community. The two main effects that can be seen according to Benkler are a \"thickening of preexisting relations with friends, family and neighbours\" and the beginnings of the \"emergence of greater scope for limited-purpose, loose relationships.\"<ref name=\"Benkler\" /> Despite being acknowledged as \"loose\" relationships, Benkler argues that they remain meaningful.\n\nPrevious concerns about the effects of Internet use on community and family fell into two categories: 1) sustained, intimate human relations \"are critical to well-functioning human beings as a matter of psychological need\" and 2) people with \"social capital\" are better off than those who lack it. It leads to better results in terms of political participation.<ref name=\"Benkler\" /> However, Benkler argues that unless Internet connections actually displace direct, unmediated, human contact, there is no basis to think that using the Internet will lead to a decline in those nourishing connections we need psychologically, or in the useful connections we make socially. Benkler continues to suggest that the nature of an individual changes over time, based on social practices and expectations. There is a shift from individuals who depend upon locally embedded, unmediated and stable social relationships to networked individuals who are more dependent upon their own combination of strong and weak ties across boundaries and weave their own fluid relationships. Manuel Castells calls this the 'networked society'.<ref name=\"Benkler\" />\n\n==Types==\n\n=== Internet-based ===\nThe explosive diffusion<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Constance Elise|date=2004-11-01|title=A Typology of Virtual Communities: a Multi-Disciplinary Foundation for Future Research|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/1/JCMC1011/4614445|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=00|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00228.x}}</ref> of the Internet since the mid-1990s fostered the proliferation of virtual communities in the form of social networking services and online communities. Virtual communities may synthesize [[Web 2.0]] technologies with the community, and therefore have been described as Community 2.0, although strong community bonds have been forged online since the early 1970s on timeshare systems like [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] and later on [[Usenet]]. Online communities depend upon social interaction and exchange between users online. This interaction emphasizes the [[reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] element of the unwritten [[social contract]] between community members.\n\n===Internet message boards===\n[[File:Phpbb 3.0 prosilver.png|thumb|right|300px|An Internet forum powered by [[phpBB]]]]\nAn online [[Internet forum|message board]] is a forum where people can discuss thoughts or ideas on various topics or simply express an idea. Users may choose which thread, or board of discussion, they would like to read or contribute to. A user will start a discussion by making a post.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marone|first=Vittorio|year=2015|title=\"Keep in mind that I will be improving\": The opening post as a request for absolution|url=http://www.ojcmt.net/articles/51/518.pdf|journal=Online Journal of Communication and Media Technologies|volume=5|issue=1|pages=136\u2013158|via=|doi=10.29333/ojcmt/2499|access-date=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018152219/http://www.ojcmt.net/articles/51/518.pdf|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other users who choose to respond can follow the discussion by adding their own posts to that thread at any time. Unlike in spoken [[conversation]]s, message boards do not usually have instantaneous responses; users actively go to the website to check for responses.\n\nAnyone can register to participate in an online message board. People can choose to participate in the virtual community, even if or when they choose not to contribute their thoughts and ideas. Unlike chat rooms, at least in practice, message boards can accommodate an almost infinite number of users.\n\nInternet users' urges to talk to and reach out to strangers online is unlike those in real-life encounters where people are hesitant and often unwilling to step in to help strangers. Studies have shown that people are more likely to intervene when they are the only one in a situation. With Internet message boards, users at their computers are alone, which might contribute to their willingness to reach out. Another possible explanation is that people can withdraw from a situation much more easily online than off. They can simply click exit or log off, whereas they would have to find a physical exit and deal with the repercussions of trying to leave a situation in real life. The lack of status that is presented with an online identity also might encourage people, because, if one chooses to keep it private, there is no associated label of gender, age, ethnicity or lifestyle.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wellman |first=B. |year=1999 |title= Networks in the global village: life in contemporary communities |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vhuOBRPS-pUC&pg=PA331&dq=impacts+of+virtual+communities#v=snippet&q=belonging&f=false |isbn=9780813368214 }}</ref>\n\n===Online chat rooms===\n[[File:Xaric screen shot.jpg|right|thumb|An example of an IRC chat session on Xaric, a text-based client. Shown are two IRC channels and a private conversation.]]\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2016}}Shortly after the rise of interest in message boards and forums, people started to want a way of communicating with their \"communities\" in real time. The downside to message boards was that people would have to wait until another user replied to their posting, which, with people all around the world in different time frames, could take a while. The development of online [[chat room]]s allowed people to talk to whoever was online at the same time they were. This way, messages were sent and online users could immediately respond.\n\nThe original development by [[CB Simulator|CompuServe CB]] hosted forty channels in which users could talk to one another in real time. The idea of forty different channels led to the idea of chat rooms that were specific to different topics. Users could choose to join an already existent chat room they found interesting, or start a new \"room\" if they found nothing to their liking. Real-time chatting was also brought into virtual games, where people could play against one another and also talk to one another through text. Now, chat rooms can be found on all sorts of topics, so that people can talk with others who share similar interests. Chat rooms are now provided by [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) and other individual websites such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL.\n\nChat room users communicate through text-based messaging. Most chat room providers are similar and include an input box, a message window, and a participant list. The input box is where users can type their text-based message to be sent to the providing server. The server will then transmit the message to the computers of anyone in the chat room so that it can be displayed in the message window. The message window allows the conversation to be tracked and usually places a time stamp once the message is posted. There is usually a list of the users who are currently in the room, so that people can see who is in their virtual community.\n\nUsers can communicate as if they are speaking to one another in real life. This \"simulated reality\" attribute makes it easy for users to form a virtual community, because chat rooms allow users to get to know one another as if they were meeting in real life. The individual \"room\" feature also makes it more likely that the people within a chat room share a similar interest; an interest that allows them to bond with one another and be willing to form a friendship.<ref>{{cite web |last=Phelps |first=Alan |title=How Chat Rooms Work |publisher=Smartcomputing.com |date=11 July 2010 |url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/articles/archive/R0502/18R02/18R02.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/social-networking/information/chat-room.htm |title=HowStuffWorks: How Chat Rooms Work |author=Roos, Dave |date=11 July 2010 |website= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Virtual worlds===\n[[File:Party in Hyrule, Second Life, picture 2.png|thumb|A party scene from ''[[Second Life]]'' in Hyrule]]\n[[Virtual world]]s are the most interactive of all virtual community forms. In this type of virtual community, people are connected by living as an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] in a computer-based world. Users create their own avatar character (from choosing the avatar's outfits to designing the avatar's house) and control their character's life and interactions with other characters in the 3-D virtual world. It is similar to a computer game, however there is no objective for the players. A virtual world simply gives users the opportunity to build and operate a fantasy life in the virtual realm. Characters within the world can talk to one another and have almost the same interactions people would have in reality. For example, characters can socialize with one another and hold intimate relationships online.\n\nThis type of virtual community allows for people to not only hold conversations with others in real time, but also to engage and interact with others. The avatars that users create are like humans. Users can choose to make avatars like themselves, or take on an entirely different personality than them. When characters interact with other characters, they can get to know one another not only through text based talking, but also by virtual experience (such as having avatars go on a date in the virtual world). A chat room form of a virtual community may give real time conversations, but people can only talk to one another. In a virtual world, characters can do activities together, just like friends could do in reality. Communities in virtual worlds are most similar to real life communities because the characters are physically in the same place, even if the users who are operating the characters are not. It is close to reality, except that the characters are digital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/~soc/lecturers/talmud/files/547.htm |title=Virtuality and Its Discontents. |author=Turkle, Sherry |date=11 July 2010 |work=The American Prospect |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726150252/http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/~soc/lecturers/talmud/files/547.htm |archive-date=26 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Second Life]] is one of the most popular virtual worlds on the Internet. [[Whyville]] offers a good alternative for younger audiences where safety and privacy are a concern. In Whyville you use the simulation aspect of the virtual world to experiment and learn about various phenomenon.\n\nAnother use for virtual worlds has been in business communications. Benefits from virtual world technology such as photo realistic avatars and positional sound create an atmosphere for participants that provides a less fatiguing sense of presence. Enterprise controls that allow the meeting host to dictate the permissions of the attendees such as who can speak, or who can move about allow the host to control the meeting environment. Several companies are creating business based virtual worlds including [[Second Life]]. These business based worlds have stricter controls and allow functionality such as muting individual participants, desktop sharing, or access lists to provide a highly interactive and controlled virtual world to a specific business or group. Business based virtual worlds also may provide various enterprise features such as Single Sign on with third party providers, or Content Encryption.\n\n===Social network services===\n[[File:Ad-tech London 2010 (5).JPG|263x263px|thumb|Facebook on the Ad-tech 2010]]\n[[Social networking service]]s are the most prominent type of virtual community. They are either a website or software platform that focuses on creating and maintaining relationships. Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace are all virtual communities. With these sites, one often creates a profile or account, and adds friends or follow friends. This allows people to connect and look for support using the social networking service as a gathering place. These websites often allow for people to keep up to date with their friends and acquaintances' activities without making much of an effort.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Quan-Hasse |first1=A. |last2= Young |first2=A.

In participatory culture, users feel that their contributions are important and that by contributing, they are forming meaningful connections with other users. The differences between being a producer of content on the website and being a consumer on the website become blurred and overlap. According to [[Henry Jenkins]], \"Members believe their contributions matter and feel some degree of social connection with one another \"(Jenkins, et al. 2005). The exchange and consumption of information requires a degree of \"digital literacy,\" such that users are able to \"archive, annotate, appropriate, transform and recirculate media content\" (Jenkins). Specialized information communities centralizes a specific group of users who are all interested in the same topic. For example, TasteofHome.com, the website of the magazine [[Taste of Home]], is a specialized information community that focuses on baking and cooking. The users contribute consumer information relating to their hobby and additionally participate in further specialized groups and forums. Specialized Information Communities are a place where people with similar interests can discuss and share their experiences and interests.\n\n==Howard Rheingold's study==\n[[Howard Rheingold]]'s ''Virtual Community'' could be compared with [[Mark Granovetter]]'s ground-breaking \"strength of weak ties\" article published twenty years earlier in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''. Rheingold translated, practiced and published Granovetter's conjectures about strong and weak ties in the online world. His comment on the first page even illustrates the social networks in the virtual society: \"My seven year old daughter knows that her father congregates with a family of invisible friends who seem to gather in his computer. Sometimes he talks to them, even if nobody else can see them. And she knows that these invisible friends sometimes show up in the flesh, materializing from the next block or the other side of the world.\" (page 1).  Indeed, in his revised version of ''Virtual Community'', Rheingold goes so far to say that had he read [[Barry Wellman]]'s work earlier, he would have called his book \"online [[social network]]s\".\n\nRheingold's definition contains the terms \"social aggregation and personal relationships\" (pp3). Lipnack & Stamps (1997)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Virtual teams : reaching across space, time, and organizations with technology|last=Jessica.|first=Lipnack|date=1997|publisher=Wiley|others=Stamps, Jeffrey.|isbn=978-0471165538|location=New York|oclc=36138326|url=https://archive.org/details/virtualteamsreac00lipn}}</ref> and Mowshowitz (1997) point out how virtual communities can work across space, time and organizational boundaries; Lipnack & Stamps (1997)<ref name=\":0\" /> mention a common purpose; and Lee, Eom, Jung and Kim (2004) introduce \"desocialization\" which means that there is less frequent interaction with humans in traditional settings, e.g. an increase in virtual socialization. Calhoun (1991) presents a [[dystopia]] argument, asserting the impersonality of virtual networks. He argues that IT has a negative influence on offline interaction between individuals because virtual life takes over our lives. He believes that it also creates different personalities in people which can cause frictions in offline and online communities and groups and in personal contacts. (Wellman & Haythornthwaite, 2002). Recently, Mitch Parsell (2008) has suggested that virtual communities, particularly those that leverage Web 2.0 resources, can be pernicious by leading to attitude polarization, increased prejudices and enabling sick individuals to deliberately indulge in their diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Pernicious virtual communities: Identity, polarisation and the Web 2.0 |author=Parsell, M. (2008) |journal=Ethics and Information Technology |volume=10 |page=Volume 10, Number 1: 41\u201356 |doi=10.1007/s10676-008-9153-y |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Advantages of Internet communities==\nInternet communities offer the advantage of instant information exchange that is not possible in a real-life community. This interaction allows people to engage in many activities from their home, such as: shopping, paying bills, and searching for specific information. Users of online communities also have access to thousands of specific discussion groups where they can form specialized relationships and access information in such categories as: politics, technical assistance, social activities, health (see above) and recreational pleasures. Virtual communities provide an ideal medium for these types of relationships because information can easily be posted and response times can be very fast. Another benefit is that these types of communities can give users a feeling of membership and belonging. Users can give and receive support, and it is simple and cheap to use.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blanchard |first1= A.L. |last2= Markus |first2=M.L. |year=2002 |title= Sense of virtual community\u2014maintaining the experience of belonging .

Consumers generally feel very comfortable making transactions online provided that the seller has a good reputation throughout the community. Virtual communities also provide the advantage of [[disintermediation]] in commercial transactions, which eliminates vendors and connects buyers directly to suppliers. Disintermediation eliminates pricey mark-ups and allows for a more direct line of contact between the consumer and the manufacturer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rothaermel |first1=F.T. |last2= Sugiyama |first2=S. |year=2001 |title= Virtual internet communities and commercial success: individual and community-level theory grounded in the atypical case of timezone.com |journal=Journal of Management |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=297\u2013312 |doi=10.1177/014920630102700305}}</ref>\n\n==Disadvantages of Internet communities==\nWhile instant communication means fast access, it also means that information is posted without being reviewed for correctness. It is difficult to choose reliable sources because there is no editor who reviews each post and makes sure it is up to a certain degree of quality.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=M.A. |last2= Kollock |first2=P. |year=1999 |title= Communities in cyberspace|location= New York, New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIn theory, online identities can be kept anonymous which enables people to use the virtual community for fantasy role playing as in the case of [[Second Life]]'s use of avatars. Some professionals urge caution with users who use online communities because predators also frequent these communities looking for victims who are vulnerable to online [[identity theft]] or [[online predator]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last=Foster |first=D. |date=18 December 2000 |title=Community and identity in the electronic village |url=http://services.exeter.ac.uk/cmit/media/texts/porter1996/foster1996_community_and_identity/ |access-date=15 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117045700/http://services.exeter.ac.uk/cmit/media/texts/porter1996/foster1996_community_and_identity/ |archive-date=17 January 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- READ THIS FIRST:\nDo not add HTML links to this article to promote your site.

Some of the most pervasive virtual communities are [[online community|online communities]] operating under [[social networking service]]s.\n\n[[Howard Rheingold]] discussed virtual communities in his book, ''[[The Virtual Community (book)|The Virtual Community]]'', published in 1993. The book's discussion ranges from Rheingold's adventures on [[The WELL]], [[computer-mediated communication]] and social groups and information science. Technologies cited include [[Usenet]], [[MUD]]s (Multi-User Dungeon) and their derivatives [[MUSH]]es and [[MOO]]s, [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), [[chat room]]s and [[electronic mailing list]]s. Rheingold also points out the potential benefits for personal psychological well-being, as well as for society at large, of belonging to a virtual community.\n\nVirtual communities all encourage interaction, sometimes focusing around a particular interest or just to communicate. Some virtual communities do both. Community members are allowed to interact over a shared passion through various means: message boards, chat rooms, social networking World Wide Web sites, or virtual worlds.<ref>Hof, R. D., Browder, S., Elstrom, P. (5 May 1997). Internet Communities. Business Week.</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nThe traditional definition of a community is of geographically circumscribed entity (neighborhoods, villages, etc.).  Virtual communities are usually dispersed geographically, and therefore are not communities under the original definition. Some online communities are linked geographically, and are known as community websites. However, if one considers communities to simply possess boundaries of some sort between their members and non-members, then a virtual community is certainly a community.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\">Pears, Iain. 1998. An Instance of the Fingerpost. London: Jonathan Cape.\n</ref> Virtual communities resemble real life ''[[communities]]'' in the sense that they both provide support, information, friendship and acceptance between strangers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wellman |first=B |year=1999 |title= Networks in the global village: life in contemporary communities |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vhuOBRPS-pUC&pg=PA331&dq=impacts+of+virtual+communities#v=snippet&q=belonging&f=false |isbn=9780813368214 }}</ref>\n\nEarly research into the existence of media-based communities was concerned with the nature of [[virtual reality|reality]], whether communities actually could exist through the media, which could place virtual community research into the social sciences definition of ontology. In the seventeenth century, scholars associated with the [[Royal Society]] of London formed a community through the exchange of letters.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\"/> \"Community without propinquity\", coined by urban planner [[Melvin Webber]] in 1963 and \"community liberated\", analyzed by [[Barry Wellman]] in 1979 began the modern era of thinking about non-local community.<ref>Webber, Melvin. 1963. \"Order in Diversity: Community without Propinquity.\" Pp. 23\u201354 in Cities and Space: The Future Use of Urban Land, edited by J.

For example, an email distribution list operates on an informational level.\n\n=== User Experience Testing to Determine Social Codes ===\n[[User Experience]] is the ultimate goal for the program or software used by an internet community, because user experience will determine the software\u2019s success.<ref name=\"framework\">{{cite journal |last1=Sieckenius de Souza |first1=Clarisse |last2=Preece |first2=Jenny |title=A framework for analyzing and understanding online communities |journal=\u00a0Interacting with Computers |date=June 2004 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=579\u2013610}}</ref> The software for social media pages or virtual communities is structured around the users\u2019 experience and designed specifically for online use.\nUser experience testing is utilized to reveal something about the personal experience of the human being using a product or system.<ref name=\"Morgan Kaufmann\">{{cite book |last1=Tullis |first1=Thomas |last2=Albert |first2=William |title=Measuring the User Experience: Collecting, Analyzing, and Presenting Usability Metrics |date=2016 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-12-415781-1}}</ref> When it comes to testing user experience in a software interface, three main characteristics are needed: a user who is engaged, a user who is interacting with a product or interface, and defining the users\u2019 experience in ways that are and observable or measurable.<ref name=\"Morgan Kaufmann\" />\nUser experience metrics are based on a reliability and repeatability, using a consistent set of measurements to result in comparable outcomes. User experience metrics measure effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of an interface through quantifiable data collected during the testing process. \nThe widespread use of the Internet and virtual communities by millions of diverse users for socializing is a phenomenon that raises new issues for researchers and developers. The vast number and diversity of individuals participating in virtual communities worldwide makes it a challenge to test usability across platforms to ensure the best overall user experience.  Some well-established measures applied to the usability framework for online communities are speed of learning, productivity, user satisfaction, how much people remember using the software, and how many errors they make.<ref name=\"Preece\">{{cite journal |last1=Preece |first1=Jenny |title=Socialility and Usability in Online Communities: Determining and Measuring Success |journal=Behaviour & Information Technology |date=2001 |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=347\u2013356|doi=10.1080/01449290110084683 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/487c4156883c7042516a9bb1b9c1a27efa7302b6 }}</ref>\nThe human computer interactions that are measured during a usability experience test focus on the individuals rather than their social interactions in the online community. The success of an online community interface depends on the integration of usability and social semiotics. Social codes are established and reinforced by the regular repetition of behavioral patterns.<ref name=\"Semiotics\">{{cite book |last1=Chandler |first1=Daniel |title=Semiotics: The Basics |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, Oxon |edition=3}}</ref> People communicate their social identities or [[culture code]] through the work they do, the way they talk, the clothes they wear, their eating habits, domestic environments and possessions, and use of leisure time. Usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user\u2019s habits when interacting with a program. The amount of information provided during the usability test can determine demographic factors such as age, sex, or social status and help define the semiotic social code. \nDialogue and social interactions, support information design, navigation support, and accessibility are key components for good software usability.<ref name=\"Preece\" /> Efficient communication requires a common set of signs in the minds of those seeking to communicate.<ref name=\"Semiotics\" /> As technologies evolve and mature, they tend to be used by an increasingly diverse set of users. This kind of increasing complexity and evolution of technology doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the technologies are becoming easier to use.<ref name=\"Morgan Kaufmann\" /> Usability testing in virtual communities can ensure users are communicating effectively through social and semiotic codes and maintenance of social realities and identities.<ref name=\"Semiotics\" />\n\n==Effects==\n\n===On health===\n\nConcerns with a virtual community's tendency to promote less socializing include: verbal aggression and inhibitions, promotion of suicide and issues with [[privacy]]. However, studies regarding the health effects of these communities did not show any negative effects. There was a high drop-out rate of participants in the study. The health-related effects are not clear because of the lack of thoroughness and the variation in studies done on the subject.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Eysenbach |first=G |year=2004 |title= Health related virtual communities and electronic support groups: systematic review of the effects of online peer to peer interactions |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7449 |pages=1166 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/328/7449/1166.full|doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7449.1166 |pmid=15142921 |pmc=411092 }}</ref>\n\nRather, recent studies have looked into development of health related communities and their impact on those already suffering health issues.

These sites prove especially useful when related to rare medical conditions. People with rare or debilitating disorders may not be able to access support groups in their physical community, thus online communities act as primary means for such support. Online health communities can serve as supportive outlets as they facilitate connecting with others who truly understand the disease, as well as offer more practical support, such as receiving help in adjusting to life with the disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/04/04/135106113/patients-with-rare-diseases-connect-online |title=Web Communities Help Patients With Rare Diseases |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2012-07-10}}</ref> Involvement in social communities of similar health interests has created a means for patients to develop a better understanding and behavior towards treatment and health practices.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Neal |first1=L. |last2=Lindgagarrd |first2=G. |last3=Oakley |first3=K. |last4=Hansen |first4=D. |last5=Kogan |first5=S. |last6= Leimeister |first6=J.M. |last7= Selker |first7=T. |year=2006 |title=  Online Health Communities.

It is general knowledge that one participates in online communities to interact with society and develop relationships.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cocciolo |first1=A. |last2=Mineo |first2=C. |last3= Meier |first3=E. |title=Using Online Social Networks to Build Healthy Communities: A Design-based Research Investigation. 1\u201310. |url=http://www.thinkingprojects.org/bhc_paper.pdf }}</ref>  Individuals who suffer from rare or severe illnesses are unable to meet physically because of distance or because it could be a risk to their health to leave a secure environment. Thus, they have turned to the internet.  A study conducted by Haven B. Battles and Lori S. Wiener on the effects of networks on children suffering from incurable diseases reveal a positive correlation in enhancing children's behaviors and overall moods.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Battles |first1=B. |last2= Wiener |first2=L.  |year=2002 |title=  STARBRIGHT World: Effects of an Electronic Network on the Social Environment of Children With Life-Threatening Illnesses.

Some studies have indicated that virtual communities can provide valuable benefits to their users. Online health-focused communities were shown to offer a unique form of emotional support that differed from event-based realities and informational support networks. Growing amounts of presented material show how online communities affect the health of their users.  Apparently the creation of health communities has a positive impact on those who are ill or in need of medical information.<ref>{{cite book |title=Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Communities and Technologies |pages=31\u201340 |publisher=ACM |location=New York |year=2009 |doi=10.1145/1556460.1556466 |isbn=9781605587134 |series=C&T '09 |citeseerx=10.1.1.589.9656 |chapter=Supportive communication, sense of virtual community and health outcomes in online infertility groups |last1=Welbourne |first1=Jennifer L. |last2=Blanchard |first2=Anita L. |last3=Boughton |first3=Marla D. }}</ref>\n\n===On civic participation===\nNew forms of civic engagement and citizenship have emerged from the rise of social networking sites. Networking sites act as a medium for expression and discourse about issues in specific user communities. Online content-sharing sites have made it easy for youth as well as others to not only express themselves and their ideas through digital media, but also connect with large networked communities. Within these spaces, young people are pushing the boundaries of traditional forms of engagement such as voting and joining political organizations and creating their own ways to discuss, connect, and act in their communities.<ref>{{cite web |last=Carvin |first=A. |date= 1 December 2006 |title= Understanding the impact of online communities on civic engagement |url=https://www.pbs.org/teachers/learning.now/2006/12/understanding_the_impact_of_on.html }}</ref>\n\nCivic engagement through [[online volunteering]] has shown to have positive effects on personal satisfaction and development. Some 84 percent of online volunteers found that their online volunteering experience had contributed to their personal development and learning.<ref>[http://www.unv.org/annual-report-2014/index.html UNV Annual Report 2014, Innovation and Knowledge]</ref>\n\n===On communication===\nIn his book [[The Wealth of Networks]] from 2006, Yochai Benkler suggests that virtual communities would \"come to represent a new form of human communal existence, providing new scope for building a shared experience of human interaction.\"<ref name=\"Benkler\">{{cite book |last=Benkler|first=Yochai|year=2006|title=The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom|url=http://www.benkler.org/Benkler_Wealth_Of_Networks_Chapter_10.pdf}}</ref> Although Benkler's prediction has not become entirely true, clearly communications and social relations are extremely complex within a virtual community. The two main effects that can be seen according to Benkler are a \"thickening of preexisting relations with friends, family and neighbours\" and the beginnings of the \"emergence of greater scope for limited-purpose, loose relationships.\"<ref name=\"Benkler\" /> Despite being acknowledged as \"loose\" relationships, Benkler argues that they remain meaningful.\n\nPrevious concerns about the effects of Internet use on community and family fell into two categories: 1) sustained, intimate human relations \"are critical to well-functioning human beings as a matter of psychological need\" and 2) people with \"social capital\" are better off than those who lack it. It leads to better results in terms of political participation.<ref name=\"Benkler\" /> However, Benkler argues that unless Internet connections actually displace direct, unmediated, human contact, there is no basis to think that using the Internet will lead to a decline in those nourishing connections we need psychologically, or in the useful connections we make socially. Benkler continues to suggest that the nature of an individual changes over time, based on social practices and expectations. There is a shift from individuals who depend upon locally embedded, unmediated and stable social relationships to networked individuals who are more dependent upon their own combination of strong and weak ties across boundaries and weave their own fluid relationships. Manuel Castells calls this the 'networked society'.<ref name=\"Benkler\" />\n\n==Types==\n\n=== Internet-based ===\nThe explosive diffusion<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=Constance Elise|date=2004-11-01|title=A Typology of Virtual Communities: a Multi-Disciplinary Foundation for Future Research|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/1/JCMC1011/4614445|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=00|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00228.x}}</ref> of the Internet since the mid-1990s fostered the proliferation of virtual communities in the form of social networking services and online communities. Virtual communities may synthesize [[Web 2.0]] technologies with the community, and therefore have been described as Community 2.0, although strong community bonds have been forged online since the early 1970s on timeshare systems like [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] and later on [[Usenet]]. Online communities depend upon social interaction and exchange between users online. This interaction emphasizes the [[reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] element of the unwritten [[social contract]] between community members.\n\n===Internet message boards===\n[[File:Phpbb 3.0 prosilver.png|thumb|right|300px|An Internet forum powered by [[phpBB]]]]\nAn online [[Internet forum|message board]] is a forum where people can discuss thoughts or ideas on various topics or simply express an idea. Users may choose which thread, or board of discussion, they would like to read or contribute to. A user will start a discussion by making a post.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marone|first=Vittorio|year=2015|title=\"Keep in mind that I will be improving\": The opening post as a request for absolution|url=http://www.ojcmt.net/articles/51/518.pdf|journal=Online Journal of Communication and Media Technologies|volume=5|issue=1|pages=136\u2013158|via=|doi=10.29333/ojcmt/2499|access-date=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018152219/http://www.ojcmt.net/articles/51/518.pdf|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other users who choose to respond can follow the discussion by adding their own posts to that thread at any time. Unlike in spoken [[conversation]]s, message boards do not usually have instantaneous responses; users actively go to the website to check for responses.\n\nAnyone can register to participate in an online message board. People can choose to participate in the virtual community, even if or when they choose not to contribute their thoughts and ideas. Unlike chat rooms, at least in practice, message boards can accommodate an almost infinite number of users.\n\nInternet users' urges to talk to and reach out to strangers online is unlike those in real-life encounters where people are hesitant and often unwilling to step in to help strangers. Studies have shown that people are more likely to intervene when they are the only one in a situation. With Internet message boards, users at their computers are alone, which might contribute to their willingness to reach out. Another possible explanation is that people can withdraw from a situation much more easily online than off. They can simply click exit or log off, whereas they would have to find a physical exit and deal with the repercussions of trying to leave a situation in real life. The lack of status that is presented with an online identity also might encourage people, because, if one chooses to keep it private, there is no associated label of gender, age, ethnicity or lifestyle.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wellman |first=B. |year=1999 |title= Networks in the global village: life in contemporary communities |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vhuOBRPS-pUC&pg=PA331&dq=impacts+of+virtual+communities#v=snippet&q=belonging&f=false |isbn=9780813368214 }}</ref>\n\n===Online chat rooms===\n[[File:Xaric screen shot.jpg|right|thumb|An example of an IRC chat session on Xaric, a text-based client. Shown are two IRC channels and a private conversation.]]\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2016}}Shortly after the rise of interest in message boards and forums, people started to want a way of communicating with their \"communities\" in real time. The downside to message boards was that people would have to wait until another user replied to their posting, which, with people all around the world in different time frames, could take a while. The development of online [[chat room]]s allowed people to talk to whoever was online at the same time they were. This way, messages were sent and online users could immediately respond.\n\nThe original development by [[CB Simulator|CompuServe CB]] hosted forty channels in which users could talk to one another in real time. The idea of forty different channels led to the idea of chat rooms that were specific to different topics. Users could choose to join an already existent chat room they found interesting, or start a new \"room\" if they found nothing to their liking. Real-time chatting was also brought into virtual games, where people could play against one another and also talk to one another through text. Now, chat rooms can be found on all sorts of topics, so that people can talk with others who share similar interests. Chat rooms are now provided by [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) and other individual websites such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL.\n\nChat room users communicate through text-based messaging. Most chat room providers are similar and include an input box, a message window, and a participant list. The input box is where users can type their text-based message to be sent to the providing server. The server will then transmit the message to the computers of anyone in the chat room so that it can be displayed in the message window. The message window allows the conversation to be tracked and usually places a time stamp once the message is posted. There is usually a list of the users who are currently in the room, so that people can see who is in their virtual community.\n\nUsers can communicate as if they are speaking to one another in real life. This \"simulated reality\" attribute makes it easy for users to form a virtual community, because chat rooms allow users to get to know one another as if they were meeting in real life. The individual \"room\" feature also makes it more likely that the people within a chat room share a similar interest; an interest that allows them to bond with one another and be willing to form a friendship.<ref>{{cite web |last=Phelps |first=Alan |title=How Chat Rooms Work |publisher=Smartcomputing.com |date=11 July 2010 |url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/articles/archive/R0502/18R02/18R02.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/social-networking/information/chat-room.htm |title=HowStuffWorks: How Chat Rooms Work |author=Roos, Dave |date=11 July 2010 |website= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Virtual worlds===\n[[File:Party in Hyrule, Second Life, picture 2.png|thumb|A party scene from ''[[Second Life]]'' in Hyrule]]\n[[Virtual world]]s are the most interactive of all virtual community forms. In this type of virtual community, people are connected by living as an [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] in a computer-based world. Users create their own avatar character (from choosing the avatar's outfits to designing the avatar's house) and control their character's life and interactions with other characters in the 3-D virtual world. It is similar to a computer game, however there is no objective for the players. A virtual world simply gives users the opportunity to build and operate a fantasy life in the virtual realm. Characters within the world can talk to one another and have almost the same interactions people would have in reality. For example, characters can socialize with one another and hold intimate relationships online.\n\nThis type of virtual community allows for people to not only hold conversations with others in real time, but also to engage and interact with others. The avatars that users create are like humans. Users can choose to make avatars like themselves, or take on an entirely different personality than them. When characters interact with other characters, they can get to know one another not only through text based talking, but also by virtual experience (such as having avatars go on a date in the virtual world). A chat room form of a virtual community may give real time conversations, but people can only talk to one another. In a virtual world, characters can do activities together, just like friends could do in reality. Communities in virtual worlds are most similar to real life communities because the characters are physically in the same place, even if the users who are operating the characters are not. It is close to reality, except that the characters are digital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/~soc/lecturers/talmud/files/547.htm |title=Virtuality and Its Discontents. |author=Turkle, Sherry |date=11 July 2010 |work=The American Prospect |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726150252/http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/~soc/lecturers/talmud/files/547.htm |archive-date=26 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Second Life]] is one of the most popular virtual worlds on the Internet. [[Whyville]] offers a good alternative for younger audiences where safety and privacy are a concern. In Whyville you use the simulation aspect of the virtual world to experiment and learn about various phenomenon.\n\nAnother use for virtual worlds has been in business communications. Benefits from virtual world technology such as photo realistic avatars and positional sound create an atmosphere for participants that provides a less fatiguing sense of presence. Enterprise controls that allow the meeting host to dictate the permissions of the attendees such as who can speak, or who can move about allow the host to control the meeting environment. Several companies are creating business based virtual worlds including [[Second Life]]. These business based worlds have stricter controls and allow functionality such as muting individual participants, desktop sharing, or access lists to provide a highly interactive and controlled virtual world to a specific business or group. Business based virtual worlds also may provide various enterprise features such as Single Sign on with third party providers, or Content Encryption.\n\n===Social network services===\n[[File:Ad-tech London 2010 (5).JPG|263x263px|thumb|Facebook on the Ad-tech 2010]]\n[[Social networking service]]s are the most prominent type of virtual community. They are either a website or software platform that focuses on creating and maintaining relationships. Facebook, Twitter, and Myspace are all virtual communities. With these sites, one often creates a profile or account, and adds friends or follow friends. This allows people to connect and look for support using the social networking service as a gathering place. These websites often allow for people to keep up to date with their friends and acquaintances' activities without making much of an effort.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Quan-Hasse |first1=A. |last2= Young |first2=A.

Conference Proceedings \u2013 National Communication Association/American Forensic Association (Alta Conference on Argumentation), 550\u2013557 }}</ref> All of these functions encourage people to form a community, large or small, on the Internet.\n\n===Specialized information communities===\nParticipatory culture plays a large role in online and virtual communities. In participatory culture, users feel that their contributions are important and that by contributing, they are forming meaningful connections with other users. The differences between being a producer of content on the website and being a consumer on the website become blurred and overlap. According to [[Henry Jenkins]], \"Members believe their contributions matter and feel some degree of social connection with one another \"(Jenkins, et al. 2005). The exchange and consumption of information requires a degree of \"digital literacy,\" such that users are able to \"archive, annotate, appropriate, transform and recirculate media content\" (Jenkins). Specialized information communities centralizes a specific group of users who are all interested in the same topic. For example, TasteofHome.com, the website of the magazine [[Taste of Home]], is a specialized information community that focuses on baking and cooking. The users contribute consumer information relating to their hobby and additionally participate in further specialized groups and forums. Specialized Information Communities are a place where people with similar interests can discuss and share their experiences and interests.\n\n==Howard Rheingold's study==\n[[Howard Rheingold]]'s ''Virtual Community'' could be compared with [[Mark Granovetter]]'s ground-breaking \"strength of weak ties\" article published twenty years earlier in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''. Rheingold translated, practiced and published Granovetter's conjectures about strong and weak ties in the online world. His comment on the first page even illustrates the social networks in the virtual society: \"My seven year old daughter knows that her father congregates with a family of invisible friends who seem to gather in his computer. Sometimes he talks to them, even if nobody else can see them. And she knows that these invisible friends sometimes show up in the flesh, materializing from the next block or the other side of the world.\" (page 1).  Indeed, in his revised version of ''Virtual Community'', Rheingold goes so far to say that had he read [[Barry Wellman]]'s work earlier, he would have called his book \"online [[social network]]s\".\n\nRheingold's definition contains the terms \"social aggregation and personal relationships\" (pp3). Lipnack & Stamps (1997)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Virtual teams : reaching across space, time, and organizations with technology|last=Jessica.|first=Lipnack|date=1997|publisher=Wiley|others=Stamps, Jeffrey.|isbn=978-0471165538|location=New York|oclc=36138326|url=https://archive.org/details/virtualteamsreac00lipn}}</ref> and Mowshowitz (1997) point out how virtual communities can work across space, time and organizational boundaries; Lipnack & Stamps (1997)<ref name=\":0\" /> mention a common purpose; and Lee, Eom, Jung and Kim (2004) introduce \"desocialization\" which means that there is less frequent interaction with humans in traditional settings, e.g. an increase in virtual socialization. Calhoun (1991) presents a [[dystopia]] argument, asserting the impersonality of virtual networks. He argues that IT has a negative influence on offline interaction between individuals because virtual life takes over our lives. He believes that it also creates different personalities in people which can cause frictions in offline and online communities and groups and in personal contacts. (Wellman & Haythornthwaite, 2002). Recently, Mitch Parsell (2008) has suggested that virtual communities, particularly those that leverage Web 2.0 resources, can be pernicious by leading to attitude polarization, increased prejudices and enabling sick individuals to deliberately indulge in their diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Pernicious virtual communities: Identity, polarisation and the Web 2.0 |author=Parsell, M. (2008) |journal=Ethics and Information Technology |volume=10 |page=Volume 10, Number 1: 41\u201356 |doi=10.1007/s10676-008-9153-y |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Advantages of Internet communities==\nInternet communities offer the advantage of instant information exchange that is not possible in a real-life community. This interaction allows people to engage in many activities from their home, such as: shopping, paying bills, and searching for specific information. Users of online communities also have access to thousands of specific discussion groups where they can form specialized relationships and access information in such categories as: politics, technical assistance, social activities, health (see above) and recreational pleasures. Virtual communities provide an ideal medium for these types of relationships because information can easily be posted and response times can be very fast. Another benefit is that these types of communities can give users a feeling of membership and belonging. Users can give and receive support, and it is simple and cheap to use.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blanchard |first1= A.L. |last2= Markus |first2=M.L. |year=2002 |title= Sense of virtual community\u2014maintaining the experience of belonging . Proceedings of the 35th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences |citeseerx= 10.1.1.11.9800 }}</ref>\n\nEconomically, virtual communities can be commercially successful, making money through membership fees, subscriptions, usage fees, and advertising commission. Consumers generally feel very comfortable making transactions online provided that the seller has a good reputation throughout the community. Virtual communities also provide the advantage of [[disintermediation]] in commercial transactions, which eliminates vendors and connects buyers directly to suppliers. Disintermediation eliminates pricey mark-ups and allows for a more direct line of contact between the consumer and the manufacturer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rothaermel |first1=F.T. |last2= Sugiyama |first2=S. |year=2001 |title= Virtual internet communities and commercial success: individual and community-level theory grounded in the atypical case of timezone.com |journal=Journal of Management |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=297\u2013312 |doi=10.1177/014920630102700305}}</ref>\n\n==Disadvantages of Internet communities==\nWhile instant communication means fast access, it also means that information is posted without being reviewed for correctness. It is difficult to choose reliable sources because there is no editor who reviews each post and makes sure it is up to a certain degree of quality.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=M.A. |last2= Kollock |first2=P. |year=1999 |title= Communities in cyberspace|location= New York, New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIn theory, online identities can be kept anonymous which enables people to use the virtual community for fantasy role playing as in the case of [[Second Life]]'s use of avatars. Some professionals urge caution with users who use online communities because predators also frequent these communities looking for victims who are vulnerable to online [[identity theft]] or [[online predator]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last=Foster |first=D. |date=18 December 2000 |title=Community and identity in the electronic village |url=http://services.exeter.ac.uk/cmit/media/texts/porter1996/foster1996_community_and_identity/ |access-date=15 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117045700/http://services.exeter.ac.uk/cmit/media/texts/porter1996/foster1996_community_and_identity/ |archive-date=17 January 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- READ THIS FIRST:\nDo not add HTML links to this article to promote your site.

A EULA specifies in detail the rights and restrictions which apply to the use of the software.<ref>[[Linux Foundation]], [http://www.linfo.org/eula.html EULA Definition], published 28 February 2006, accessed 10 August 2019</ref>\n\nMany form contracts are only contained in digital form, and only presented to a user as a [[#Shrink-wrap and click-wrap licenses|click-through]] which the user must \"accept\". As the user may not see the agreement until after he or she has already purchased the software, these documents may be [[contracts of adhesion]].\n\nSoftware companies often make special agreements with large businesses and government entities that include support contracts and specially drafted warranties.\n\nSome end-user license agreements accompany shrink-wrapped software that is presented to a user sometimes on paper or more usually electronically, during the installation procedure. The user has the choice of accepting or rejecting the agreement. The installation of the software is conditional to the user clicking a button labelled \"accept\".  See <!--the # (called an \"anchor\") means it is on the same page-->[[#Shrink-wrap and click-wrap licenses|below]].\n\nMany EULAs assert extensive liability limitations.  Most commonly, an EULA will attempt to [[hold harmless]] the software licensor in the event that the software causes damage to the user's computer or data, but some software also proposes limitations on whether the licensor can be held liable for damage that arises through improper use of the software (for example, incorrectly using tax preparation software and incurring penalties as a result). One case upholding such limitations on [[consequential damages]] is ''M.A. Mortenson Co. v. Timberline Software Corp., et al.''{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Some EULAs also claim restrictions on venue and applicable law in the event that a legal dispute arises.\n\nSome copyright owners use EULAs in an effort to circumvent limitations the applicable copyright law places on their copyrights (such as the limitations in sections 107\u2013122 of the [[United States Copyright Act]]), or to expand the scope of control over the work into areas for which copyright protection is denied by law (such as attempting to charge for, regulate or prevent private performances of a work beyond a certain number of performances or beyond a certain period of time).

No agreement between parties is ever held, because a copyright license is simply a declaration of permissions on something that otherwise would be disallowed by default under copyright law.<ref name=moglen />\n\n==Shrink-wrap and click-wrap licenses {{Anchor|Shrink-wrap and click-wrap licenses}}==\n{{main|Clickwrap|Browsewrap|Shrink wrap contract}}\n\nThe term '''shrink-wrap license''' refers colloquially to any software license agreement which is enclosed within a software package and is inaccessible to the customer until after purchase.  Typically, the license agreement is printed on paper included inside the boxed software.  It may also be presented to the user on-screen during installation, in which case the license is sometimes referred to as a '''click-wrap license'''.  The inability of the customer to review the license agreement before purchasing the software has caused such licenses to run afoul of legal challenges in some cases.\n\nWhether shrink-wrap licenses are legally binding differs between jurisdictions, though a majority of jurisdictions hold such licenses to be enforceable. At particular issue is the difference in opinion between two US courts in ''[http://www.internetlibrary.com/cases/lib_case209.cfm Klocek v. Gateway]'' and ''[http://www.netlitigation.com/netlitigation/cases/brower.htm Brower v. Gateway]''.  Both cases involved a shrink-wrapped license document provided by the online vendor of a computer system.  The terms of the shrink-wrapped license were not provided at the time of purchase, but were rather included with the shipped product as a printed document.  The license required the customer to return the product within a limited time frame if the license was not agreed to. In ''Brower'', New York's state appeals court ruled that the terms of the shrink-wrapped license document were enforceable because the customer's assent was evident by its failure to return the merchandise within the 30 days specified by the document.  The U.S. District Court of Kansas in ''Klocek'' ruled that the contract of sale was complete at the time of the transaction, and the additional shipped terms contained in a document similar to that in ''Brower'' did not constitute a contract, because the customer never agreed to them when the contract of sale was completed.\n\nFurther, in ''[[ProCD v. Zeidenberg]]'', the license was ruled enforceable because it was necessary for the customer to assent to the terms of the agreement by clicking on an \"I Agree\" button in order to install the software. In [[Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp.]], however, the licensee was able to download and install the software without first being required to review and positively assent to the terms of the agreement, and so the license was held to be unenforceable.\n\nClick-wrap license agreements refer to website based contract formation (see iLan Systems, Inc. v. Netscout Service Level Corp.). A common example of this occurs where a user must affirmatively assent to license terms of a website, by ''clicking'' \"yes\" on a pop-up, in order to access website features. This is therefore analogous to shrink-wrap licenses, where a buyer implied agrees to license terms by first removing the software package's shrink-wrap and then utilizing the software itself. In both types of analysis, focus is on the actions of end user and asks whether there is an explicit or implicit acceptance of the additional licensing terms.\n\n==Product liability==\nMost licenses for software sold at retail disclaim (as far as local laws permit) any [[warranty]] on the performance of the software and limit liability for any damages to the purchase price of the software.  One well-known case which upheld such a disclaimer is Mortenson v. Timberline .\n\n==Patent==\n{{main|Software patent}}\nIn addition to the implied [[exhaustion doctrine]], the distributor may include patent licenses along with software.\n\n==Reverse engineering==\nForms often prohibit users from [[reverse engineering]]. This may also serve to make it difficult to develop third-party software which interoperates with the licensed software, thus [[Vendor lock-in|increasing the value of the publisher's solutions]] through decreased customer choice. In the United States, EULA provisions can preempt the reverse engineering rights implied by fair use, c.f. [[Bowers v. Baystate Technologies]].\n\nSome licenses<ref>Examples include [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms994405.aspx Microsoft .NET Framework redistributable EULA]</ref> purport to prohibit a user's right to release data on the performance of the software, but this has yet to be challenged in court.\n\n==Enforceability of EULAs in the United States==\n{{Primary sources|section about the legal enforceability of end-user license agreement|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe enforceability of an EULA depends on several factors, one of them being the court in which the case is heard.  Some courts that have addressed the validity of the shrinkwrap license agreements have found some EULAs to be invalid, characterizing them as [[adhesion contract|contracts of adhesion]], [[Unconscionability|unconscionable]], and/or unacceptable pursuant to the [[Uniform Commercial Code|U.C.C.]]\u2014see, for instance, ''[[Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology]]'',<ref>939 F.2d 91 (3rd Cir., 1991)</ref> ''[[Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.]]''.<ref>847 F.2d 255 (5th Cir., 1988)</ref>  Other courts have determined that the shrinkwrap license agreement is valid and enforceable: see ''[[ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg]]'',<ref>86 F.3d 1447 (7th Cir., 1996)</ref> ''[[Microsoft Corp. v. Harmony Comps. & Elecs., Inc.|Microsoft v. Harmony Computers]]'',<ref>846 F. Supp. 208 (E.D.N.Y., 1994)</ref> ''Novell v. Network Trade Center'',<ref>25 F.Supp.2d 1218 (D. Utah, 1997)</ref> and ''[[Ariz. Cartridge Remanufacturers Ass'n v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.]]''<ref>421 F.3d 981 (9th Cir., 2005)</ref> may have some bearing as well. No court has ruled on the validity of EULAs generally; decisions are limited to particular provisions and terms.\n\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Circuit]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|8th Circuit]] subscribe to the \"licensed and not sold\" argument, while most other circuits do not {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}.  In addition, the contracts' enforceability depends on whether the state has passed the [[Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act]] (UCITA) or Anti-UCITA]] ([[UCITA Bomb Shelter) laws. In Anti-UCITA states, the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC) has been amended to either specifically define software as a good (thus making it fall under the UCC), or to disallow contracts which specify that the terms of contract are subject to the laws of a state that has passed UCITA.\n\nRecently{{when|date=December 2013}}, publishers have begun to [[encryption|encrypt]] their software packages to make it impossible for a user to install the software without either agreeing to the license agreement or violating the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) and [[WIPO Copyright Treaty|foreign counterparts]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe DMCA specifically provides for reverse engineering of software for interoperability purposes, so there was some controversy as to whether software license agreement clauses which restrict this are enforceable.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|8th Circuit]] case of ''Davidson & Associates v. Jung''<ref>422 F. 3d 630 (8th Cir., 2005)</ref> determined that such clauses are enforceable, following the [[Federal Circuit]] decision of ''[[Bowers v. Baystate Technologies|Baystate v. Bowers]]''.<ref>302 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir., 2002)</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n[[Jerry Pournelle]] wrote in 1983, \"I've seen no evidence to show that ... Levitical agreements \u2014 full of \"Thou Shalt Nots\" \u2014 have any effect on piracy\". He gave an example of an EULA that was impossible for a user to comply with, stating \"Come on, fellows. No one expects these agreements to be kept\". Noting that in practice many companies were more generous to their customers than their EULAs required, Pournelle wondered \"Why, then, do they insist on making their customers sign 'agreements' that the customer has no intention of keeping, and which the company ''knows'' won't be kept? ... Must we continue making hypocrites out of both publishers and customers?\"<ref name=\"pournelle198306\">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-06/1983_06_BYTE_08-06_16-Bit_Designs#page/n411/mode/2up | title=Zenith Z-100, Epson QX-10, Software Licensing, and the Software Piracy Problem | magazine=BYTE | date=June 1983 | accessdate=20 October 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=411}}</ref>\n\nOne common criticism of end-user license agreements is that they are often far too lengthy for users to devote the time to thoroughly read them. In March 2012, the [[PayPal]] end-user license agreement was 36,275 words long<ref>{{cite web|title=No One Reads the \"Terms And Conditions\" and Here\u2019s Why|url=http://1025kiss.com/no-one-reads-the-terms-and-conditions-and-heres-why/|publisher=102.5 KISSFM|accessdate=24 November 2012|author=Heathen|date=23 March 2012}}</ref> and in May 2011 the [[iTunes]] agreement was 56 pages long.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pidaparthy|first=Umika|title=What you should know about iTunes' 56-page legal terms|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/web/05/06/itunes.terms/|accessdate=24 November 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=May 6, 2011}}</ref> News sources reporting these findings asserted that the vast majority of users do not read the documents because of their length.\n\nSeveral companies have parodied this belief that users do not read the end-user-license agreements by adding unusual clauses, knowing that few users will ever read them. As an [[April Fool's Day]] joke, [[Gamestation]] added a clause stating that users who placed an order on April 1, 2010 agreed to irrevocably [[Deal with the Devil|give their soul]] to the company, which 7,500 users agreed to. Although there was a checkbox to exempt out of the \"immortal soul\" clause, few users checked it and thus Gamestation concluded that 88% of their users did not read the agreement.<ref>{{cite news|title=7,500 Online Shoppers Unknowingly Sold Their Souls|url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2010/04/15/online-shoppers-unknowingly-sold-souls/|accessdate=24 November 2012|newspaper=FoxNews.com|date=April 15, 2010}}</ref> The program ''PC Pitstop'' included a clause in their end-user license agreement stating that anybody who read the clause and contacted the company would receive a monetary reward, but it took four months and over 3,000 software downloads before anybody collected it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Magid|first=Larry|title=PC Pitstop|url=http://www.pcpitstop.com/spycheck/eula.asp|accessdate=24 November 2012}}</ref> During the installation of version 4 of the Advanced Query Tool the installer measured the elapsed time between the appearance and the acceptance of the end-user license agreements to calculate the average reading speed.

For example, Clickwrapped, a service that rates consumer companies according to how well they respect the rights of users, reports that they increasingly include a term that prevents a user from suing the company in court.<ref>Jamillah Knowles. ''Clickwrapped report tells you which sites claim ownership of your content, and you\u2019ll be surprised''. TheNextWeb. August 21, 2012. Accessed July 29, 2013.</ref>\n\nIn a recent article published by Kevin Litman-Navarro for the New York Times, titled ''We Read 150 Privacy Policies.

As a result, for example, the majority of licenses require college or higher-level degrees: \"To be successful in college, people need to understand texts with a score of 1300. People in the professions, like doctors and lawyers, should be able to understand materials with scores of 1440, while ninth graders should understand texts that score above 1050 to be on track for college or a career by the time they graduate.

Gateway]'' and ''[http://www.netlitigation.com/netlitigation/cases/brower.htm Brower v. Gateway]''.  Both cases involved a shrink-wrapped license document provided by the online vendor of a computer system.  The terms of the shrink-wrapped license were not provided at the time of purchase, but were rather included with the shipped product as a printed document.  The license required the customer to return the product within a limited time frame if the license was not agreed to.  In ''Brower'', New York's state appeals court ruled that the terms of the shrink-wrapped license document were enforceable because the customer's assent was evident by its failure to return the merchandise within the 30 days specified by the document.  The U.S. District Court of Kansas in ''Klocek'' ruled that the contract of sale was complete at the time of the transaction, and the additional shipped terms contained in a document similar to that in ''Brower'' did not constitute a contract, because the customer never agreed to them when the contract of sale was completed.\n\nFurther, in ''[[ProCD v. Zeidenberg]]'', the license was ruled enforceable because it was necessary for the customer to assent to the terms of the agreement by clicking on an \"I Agree\" button in order to install the software. In [[Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp.]], however, the licensee was able to download and install the software without first being required to review and positively assent to the terms of the agreement, and so the license was held to be unenforceable.\n\nClick-wrap license agreements refer to website based contract formation (see iLan Systems, Inc. v. Netscout Service Level Corp.). A common example of this occurs where a user must affirmatively assent to license terms of a website, by ''clicking'' \"yes\" on a pop-up, in order to access website features. This is therefore analogous to shrink-wrap licenses, where a buyer implied agrees to license terms by first removing the software package's shrink-wrap and then utilizing the software itself. In both types of analysis, focus is on the actions of end user and asks whether there is an explicit or implicit acceptance of the additional licensing terms.\n\n==Product liability==\nMost licenses for software sold at retail disclaim (as far as local laws permit) any [[warranty]] on the performance of the software and limit liability for any damages to the purchase price of the software.  One well-known case which upheld such a disclaimer is Mortenson v. Timberline .\n\n==Patent==\n{{main|Software patent}}\nIn addition to the implied [[exhaustion doctrine]], the distributor may include patent licenses along with software.\n\n==Reverse engineering==\nForms often prohibit users from [[reverse engineering]]. This may also serve to make it difficult to develop third-party software which interoperates with the licensed software, thus [[Vendor lock-in|increasing the value of the publisher's solutions]] through decreased customer choice. In the United States, EULA provisions can preempt the reverse engineering rights implied by fair use, c.f. [[Bowers v. Baystate Technologies]].\n\nSome licenses<ref>Examples include [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms994405.aspx Microsoft .NET Framework redistributable EULA]</ref> purport to prohibit a user's right to release data on the performance of the software, but this has yet to be challenged in court.\n\n==Enforceability of EULAs in the United States==\n{{Primary sources|section about the legal enforceability of end-user license agreement|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe enforceability of an EULA depends on several factors, one of them being the court in which the case is heard.  Some courts that have addressed the validity of the shrinkwrap license agreements have found some EULAs to be invalid, characterizing them as [[adhesion contract|contracts of adhesion]], [[Unconscionability|unconscionable]], and/or unacceptable pursuant to the [[Uniform Commercial Code|U.C.C.]]\u2014see, for instance, ''[[Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology]]'',<ref>939 F.2d 91 (3rd Cir., 1991)</ref> ''[[Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.]]''.<ref>847 F.2d 255 (5th Cir., 1988)</ref>  Other courts have determined that the shrinkwrap license agreement is valid and enforceable: see ''[[ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg]]'',<ref>86 F.3d 1447 (7th Cir., 1996)</ref> ''[[Microsoft Corp. v. Harmony Comps. & Elecs., Inc.|Microsoft v. Harmony Computers]]'',<ref>846 F. Supp. 208 (E.D.N.Y., 1994)</ref> ''Novell v. Network Trade Center'',<ref>25 F.Supp.2d 1218 (D. Utah, 1997)</ref> and ''[[Ariz. Cartridge Remanufacturers Ass'n v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.]]''<ref>421 F.3d 981 (9th Cir., 2005)</ref> may have some bearing as well. No court has ruled on the validity of EULAs generally; decisions are limited to particular provisions and terms.\n\nThe [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Circuit]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|8th Circuit]] subscribe to the \"licensed and not sold\" argument, while most other circuits do not {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}.  In addition, the contracts' enforceability depends on whether the state has passed the [[Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act]] (UCITA) or Anti-UCITA]] ([[UCITA Bomb Shelter) laws. In Anti-UCITA states, the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC) has been amended to either specifically define software as a good (thus making it fall under the UCC), or to disallow contracts which specify that the terms of contract are subject to the laws of a state that has passed UCITA.\n\nRecently{{when|date=December 2013}}, publishers have begun to [[encryption|encrypt]] their software packages to make it impossible for a user to install the software without either agreeing to the license agreement or violating the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) and [[WIPO Copyright Treaty|foreign counterparts]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe DMCA specifically provides for reverse engineering of software for interoperability purposes, so there was some controversy as to whether software license agreement clauses which restrict this are enforceable.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|8th Circuit]] case of ''Davidson & Associates v. Jung''<ref>422 F. 3d 630 (8th Cir., 2005)</ref> determined that such clauses are enforceable, following the [[Federal Circuit]] decision of ''[[Bowers v. Baystate Technologies|Baystate v. Bowers]]''.<ref>302 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir., 2002)</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n[[Jerry Pournelle]] wrote in 1983, \"I've seen no evidence to show that ... Levitical agreements \u2014 full of \"Thou Shalt Nots\" \u2014 have any effect on piracy\". He gave an example of an EULA that was impossible for a user to comply with, stating \"Come on, fellows. No one expects these agreements to be kept\". Noting that in practice many companies were more generous to their customers than their EULAs required, Pournelle wondered \"Why, then, do they insist on making their customers sign 'agreements' that the customer has no intention of keeping, and which the company ''knows'' won't be kept? ... Must we continue making hypocrites out of both publishers and customers?\"<ref name=\"pournelle198306\">{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-06/1983_06_BYTE_08-06_16-Bit_Designs#page/n411/mode/2up | title=Zenith Z-100, Epson QX-10, Software Licensing, and the Software Piracy Problem | magazine=BYTE | date=June 1983 | accessdate=20 October 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=411}}</ref>\n\nOne common criticism of end-user license agreements is that they are often far too lengthy for users to devote the time to thoroughly read them. In March 2012, the [[PayPal]] end-user license agreement was 36,275 words long<ref>{{cite web|title=No One Reads the \"Terms And Conditions\" and Here\u2019s Why|url=http://1025kiss.com/no-one-reads-the-terms-and-conditions-and-heres-why/|publisher=102.5 KISSFM|accessdate=24 November 2012|author=Heathen|date=23 March 2012}}</ref> and in May 2011 the [[iTunes]] agreement was 56 pages long.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pidaparthy|first=Umika|title=What you should know about iTunes' 56-page legal terms|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/web/05/06/itunes.terms/|accessdate=24 November 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=May 6, 2011}}</ref> News sources reporting these findings asserted that the vast majority of users do not read the documents because of their length.\n\nSeveral companies have parodied this belief that users do not read the end-user-license agreements by adding unusual clauses, knowing that few users will ever read them. As an [[April Fool's Day]] joke, [[Gamestation]] added a clause stating that users who placed an order on April 1, 2010 agreed to irrevocably [[Deal with the Devil|give their soul]] to the company, which 7,500 users agreed to. Although there was a checkbox to exempt out of the \"immortal soul\" clause, few users checked it and thus Gamestation concluded that 88% of their users did not read the agreement.<ref>{{cite news|title=7,500 Online Shoppers Unknowingly Sold Their Souls|url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2010/04/15/online-shoppers-unknowingly-sold-souls/|accessdate=24 November 2012|newspaper=FoxNews.com|date=April 15, 2010}}</ref> The program ''PC Pitstop'' included a clause in their end-user license agreement stating that anybody who read the clause and contacted the company would receive a monetary reward, but it took four months and over 3,000 software downloads before anybody collected it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Magid|first=Larry|title=PC Pitstop|url=http://www.pcpitstop.com/spycheck/eula.asp|accessdate=24 November 2012}}</ref> During the installation of version 4 of the Advanced Query Tool the installer measured the elapsed time between the appearance and the acceptance of the end-user license agreements to calculate the average reading speed.

For example, Clickwrapped, a service that rates consumer companies according to how well they respect the rights of users, reports that they increasingly include a term that prevents a user from suing the company in court.<ref>Jamillah Knowles. ''Clickwrapped report tells you which sites claim ownership of your content, and you\u2019ll be surprised''. TheNextWeb. August 21, 2012. Accessed July 29, 2013.</ref>\n\nIn a recent article published by Kevin Litman-Navarro for the New York Times, titled ''We Read 150 Privacy Policies. They Were an Incomprehensible Disaster''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/12/opinion/facebook-google-privacy-policies.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/12/opinion/facebook-google-privacy-policies.html|title=Opinion {{!}} We Read 150 Privacy Policies.

As a result, for example, the majority of licenses require college or higher-level degrees: \"To be successful in college, people need to understand texts with a score of 1300. People in the professions, like doctors and lawyers, should be able to understand materials with scores of 1440, while ninth graders should understand texts that score above 1050 to be on track for college or a career by the time they graduate. Many privacy policies exceed these standards.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Abandonware]]\n* [[Clickwrap|Clickwrap license]]\n* [[Free software license]]\n* [[:wikt:Appendix:Glossary of legal terms in technology|Glossary of legal terms in technology]]\n** [[Good faith (law)]]\n**[[Contra proferentem]]\n* [[Index of Articles Relating to Terms of Service and Privacy Policies]]\n* [[License manager]]\n* [[List of software licenses]]\n* [[Shrink wrap contract]]\n* [[Software Asset Management]]\n* [[Software license]]\n* [[Terms of service]]\n* ''[[Vernor v.

The band soon secured a recording contract and released their [[The Runaways (album)|first album]] in 1976. The band garnered significant media attention and the Runaways became a successful recording and touring act during their late 1970s heyday. Ford's lead-guitar playing became an integral element of the band's sound until their eventual break-up in April 1979.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lita Ford looks back on The Runaways' breakup: \"We were going in different musical directions\" |url=http://bravewords.com/news/lita-ford-looks-back-on-the-runaways-break-up-we-weren-t-a-team-we-were-going-in-different-musical-directions |website=Brave Words}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, internal conflicts were erupting within the Runaways, who had by that time already parted ways with producer Fowley, lead singer [[Cherie Currie]], and bassist [[Jackie Fox]]. Vocalist/guitarist [[Joan Jett]] wanted the band to shift to a more [[Ramones]]-influenced [[punk rock|punk rock sound]], while Ford and drummer [[Sandy West]] wanted to continue playing the [[hard rock]]-oriented songs the band had become known for.<ref name=\"Sherman, Dale p53\">Sherman, Dale.

Her debut solo album, entitled ''[[Out for Blood (Lita Ford album)|Out for Blood]]'', was released in 1983 and was a commercial disappointment. Her next release, ''[[Dancin' on the Edge]]'' (1984) achieved moderate success and Ford's popularity began to rise. ''Dancin' on the Edge'' included the single \"Fire in My Heart\", which reached the Top 10 in several countries outside the United States. The follow-up single, \"Gotta Let Go\", performed better, reaching number one on the Mainstream Rock charts. Ford said in an interview that she recorded an unreleased album with [[RCA Records]], and [[Tony Iommi]] didn't perform on it.<ref name=\"podcastone1\"/>\n\nFord signed with [[RCA Records]], hired [[Sharon Osbourne Management]], and re-emerged with a more radio-friendly [[Glam metal|pop-metal]] sound. In 1988, she released her most commercially successful album, the self-produced ''[[Lita (album)|Lita]]''. The album featured several singles including \"[[Kiss Me Deadly (song)|Kiss Me Deadly]]\", \"Back to the Cave\", \"[[Close My Eyes Forever]]\", and \"Falling in and Out of Love\", a song co-written by [[Nikki Sixx]] of [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]. The ballad \"Close My Eyes Forever\", a duet with [[Ozzy Osbourne]], remains her most successful song, reaching No. 8 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"billboard\" />\nFord followed up the success of ''Lita'' with the album ''[[Stiletto (album)|Stiletto]]'' (1990). ''Stiletto'' featured the singles \"Hungry\" and \"Lisa\" (a song dedicated to her mother). However, the album failed to match the success of her previous release. Ford's next release was ''[[Dangerous Curves (album)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1991), which featured her last charting single to date, \"Shot of Poison\". Ford's final album prior to a lengthy recording hiatus was ''[[Black (Lita Ford album)|Black]]'' on the German [[ZYX Records]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Long hiatus (1996\u20132007)===\n[[File:Lita Ford.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Ford performing on 27 June 2009.]]\nBy the mid-1990s, Ford placed a reduced priority on her music career as she turned her attention towards raising her two young sons.

She wrote that she found it \"strange\" that they never spoke about boys with her and were \"always giggling about other girls\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lita-ford-left-the-runaways-after-learning-about-gay-bandmates_n_56ce07d9e4b041136f193847|title=Lita Ford Reveals She Quit The Runaways Because Her Bandmates 'Were All Gay'|first=Kira|last=Brekke|date=29 February 2016|website=HuffPost.com|accessdate=November 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Acting and other projects==\n[[File:Lita Ford and Patrick Kennison.jpg|thumb|Ford performing with [[Patrick Kennison]]]]\nDuring her solo career, Ford endorsed musical instrument manufacturer [[B.C.

The 1992 TV series ''[[Howie (TV series)|Howie]]'', starring [[Howie Mandel]], saw Ford as a regular guitarist for the house band. Ford also had a small role in the 1992 horror/comedy film ''[[Highway to Hell (film)|Highway to Hell]]'' playing a character called \"The Hitchhiker\". Ford was also asked by [[VH-1]] to join the cast of the seventh season of the reality television program ''[[The Surreal Life]]'' in 2007, to which she declined.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lita Ford 'Turned Down' Chance to Appear in 'Surreal Life' |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/lita-ford-turned-down-chance-to-appear-in-the-surreal-life/ |website=Blabbermouth.net}}</ref>\nFord contributed her likeness and voice to the [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]] and PC video game ''[[Br\u00fctal Legend]]''.

Her song \"Betrayal\" is also one of the 100+ songs that appear in the game.\n\nIn 2010, a major Hollywood motion picture chronicling the career of Ford's first band, The Runaways, was produced. Ford was portrayed by actress [[Scout Taylor-Compton]] in the movie, entitled ''[[The Runaways (2010 film)|The Runaways]]''. Ford is featured extensively in the 2005 documentary film ''[[Edgeplay: A Film About the Runaways]]'', in which she spoke candidly about her time in the all-female band.

The band soon secured a recording contract and released their [[The Runaways (album)|first album]] in 1976. The band garnered significant media attention and the Runaways became a successful recording and touring act during their late 1970s heyday. Ford's lead-guitar playing became an integral element of the band's sound until their eventual break-up in April 1979.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lita Ford looks back on The Runaways' breakup: \"We were going in different musical directions\" |url=http://bravewords.com/news/lita-ford-looks-back-on-the-runaways-break-up-we-weren-t-a-team-we-were-going-in-different-musical-directions |website=Brave Words}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, internal conflicts were erupting within the Runaways, who had by that time already parted ways with producer Fowley, lead singer [[Cherie Currie]], and bassist [[Jackie Fox]]. Vocalist/guitarist [[Joan Jett]] wanted the band to shift to a more [[Ramones]]-influenced [[punk rock|punk rock sound]], while Ford and drummer [[Sandy West]] wanted to continue playing the [[hard rock]]-oriented songs the band had become known for.<ref name=\"Sherman, Dale p53\">Sherman, Dale.

Her debut solo album, entitled ''[[Out for Blood (Lita Ford album)|Out for Blood]]'', was released in 1983 and was a commercial disappointment. Her next release, ''[[Dancin' on the Edge]]'' (1984) achieved moderate success and Ford's popularity began to rise. ''Dancin' on the Edge'' included the single \"Fire in My Heart\", which reached the Top 10 in several countries outside the United States. The follow-up single, \"Gotta Let Go\", performed better, reaching number one on the Mainstream Rock charts. Ford said in an interview that she recorded an unreleased album with [[RCA Records]], and [[Tony Iommi]] didn't perform on it.<ref name=\"podcastone1\"/>\n\nFord signed with [[RCA Records]], hired [[Sharon Osbourne Management]], and re-emerged with a more radio-friendly [[Glam metal|pop-metal]] sound. In 1988, she released her most commercially successful album, the self-produced ''[[Lita (album)|Lita]]''. The album featured several singles including \"[[Kiss Me Deadly (song)|Kiss Me Deadly]]\", \"Back to the Cave\", \"[[Close My Eyes Forever]]\", and \"Falling in and Out of Love\", a song co-written by [[Nikki Sixx]] of [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]. The ballad \"Close My Eyes Forever\", a duet with [[Ozzy Osbourne]], remains her most successful song, reaching No. 8 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"billboard\" />\nFord followed up the success of ''Lita'' with the album ''[[Stiletto (album)|Stiletto]]'' (1990). ''Stiletto'' featured the singles \"Hungry\" and \"Lisa\" (a song dedicated to her mother). However, the album failed to match the success of her previous release. Ford's next release was ''[[Dangerous Curves (album)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1991), which featured her last charting single to date, \"Shot of Poison\". Ford's final album prior to a lengthy recording hiatus was ''[[Black (Lita Ford album)|Black]]'' on the German [[ZYX Records]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Long hiatus (1996\u20132007)===\n[[File:Lita Ford.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Ford performing on 27 June 2009.]]\nBy the mid-1990s, Ford placed a reduced priority on her music career as she turned her attention towards raising her two young sons. Following the release of ''Black'' in 1995, Ford did not release new material until the ''[[Wicked Wonderland (album)|Wicked Wonderland]]'' album in 2009.\n\n===Return to stage (2008\u2013present)===\nIn June 2008, Ford re-emerged with a new band with Stet Howland (WASP) on drums, playing several warm-up gigs under the moniker ''Kiss Me Deadly'' prior to [[Rocklahoma]] in Pryor, Oklahoma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eddietrunk.com/index.cfm/pk/view/cd/NAA/cdid/402306/pid/401816|title=Eddie Trunk|publisher=EddieTrunk.com|accessdate=9 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927224552/http://www.eddietrunk.com/index.cfm/pk/view/cd/NAA/cdid/402306/pid/401816|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In June 2009, she toured the United States and Europe with a new line-up on her last 14 shows consisting of former [[Guns N' Roses]] guitarist [[Bumblefoot (musician)|Ron 'Bumblefoot' Thal]], drummer [[Dennis Leeflang]], and [[Deepfield (band)|Deepfield]] bassist PJ Farley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/guns-n-roses-guitarist-bumblefoot-to-tour-with-lita-ford|title=Guns N' Roses Guitarist Bumblefoot To Tour With Lita Ford|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=9 June 2009|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandsintown.com/LitaFord/past_events?page=5|title=Lita Ford Tour History from 2008 to 2016: Lita Ford Past Tour Dates|publisher=Bandsintown.com|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter a long recording hiatus, Ford released the new album ''[[Wicked Wonderland (album)|Wicked Wonderland]]'' on 6 October 2009, on the JLRG Entertainment label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.live-metal.net/interviews_litaford.html|title=Lita Ford: The Next Chapter In Her Rockin' History|accessdate=14 March 2010|last=Price|first=Jason|date=12 November 2008|publisher=Live-Metal.net}}</ref> In an interview with ExclusiveMagazine.com, Ford spoke about her new material: \"I just wanted to kick ass!

[[List of awards and nominations received by Fiona Apple|Her accolades]] include one [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy Award]], and an additional seven Grammy Award nominations in various categories.\n\nThe daughter of actor [[Brandon Maggart]], Apple was born in [[New York City]] but was raised alternating between New York and her father's home in [[Los Angeles]]. Classically trained on piano as a child, she began composing her own songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, ''[[Tidal (album)|Tidal]]'', containing songs written when she was 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Vocal Rock Performance for the single \"[[Criminal (Fiona Apple song)|Criminal]]\". She followed with ''[[When the Pawn...]]'' (1999), produced by [[Jon Brion]], which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified platinum.\n\nFor her third album, ''[[Extraordinary Machine]]'' (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began recording the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the record, leading fans to protest [[Epic Records]], erroneously believing that the label was withholding its release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005. The album was certified [[Gold album|gold]], and nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. In 2012, she released her fourth studio album, ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'', which received critical praise and was followed by a tour of the United States and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] in 2013.

Classically trained on piano as a child, she began composing her own songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, ''[[Tidal (album)|Tidal]]'', containing songs written when she was 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Vocal Rock Performance for the single \"[[Criminal (Fiona Apple song)|Criminal]]\". She followed with ''[[When the Pawn...]]'' (1999), produced by [[Jon Brion]], which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified platinum.\n\nFor her third album, ''[[Extraordinary Machine]]'' (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began recording the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the record, leading fans to protest [[Epic Records]], erroneously believing that the label was withholding its release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005. The album was certified [[Gold album|gold]], and nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. In 2012, she released her fourth studio album, ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'', which received critical praise and was followed by a tour of the United States and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] in 2013.

{"title_page": "German declaration of war against the United States", "text_new": "WW3 Is Stupid\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0703-507, Berlin, Reichstagssitzung, Rede Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|375px|[[s:Adolf Hitler's Declaration of War against the United States|Hitler announces the declaration of war against the United States]] to the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] on 11 December 1941]]\n\nOn 11 December 1941, four days after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the [[United States declaration of war on Japan|United States declaration of war against the Japanese Empire]], '''[[Nazi Germany]] declared war against the United States''', in response to what was claimed to be a series of provocations by the [[United States]] government when the U.S. was still officially [[Neutral country|neutral]] during [[World War II]]. The decision to declare war was made by [[Adolf Hitler]], apparently offhand, almost without consultation. Publicly, the formal declaration was made to American ''Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires'' [[Leland B. Morris]] by German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] in the latter's office. Later that day, the [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1941)|U.S. declared war on Germany]].\n\nWidely considered a major error in the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[dictatorship]]'s strategic actions during the war, the Nazi hierarchy held low regard for the military resolve of the U.S. under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Through the eyes of the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[ideology]] practiced by Hitler and other senior Nazis, the U.S. constituted a [[Corruption|corrupt]], [[Decadence|decadent]], and fundamentally weak nation given factors such as the large population of [[African-Americans]], [[immigrants]] and [[Jewish-Americans]] as well as the free-for-all nature of U.S. [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor}}\nThe course of relations between Germany and the United States had deteriorated since the beginning of World War II, inevitably so given the increasing cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], [[Lend-Lease]], the [[Atlantic Charter]], the [[Occupation of Iceland#United States occupation|hand-over of military control of Iceland from the United Kingdom to the United States]], the extension of the [[Pan-American Security Zone]], and many other results of the [[Special Relationship|special relationship]] which had developed between the two countries had put a strain on relations between the US, still technically a neutral country, and [[Nazi Germany]]. US destroyers escorting American supply vessels bound for the UK were already engaged in a ''de facto'' war with German [[U-Boats]].<ref name=bullock>[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]] (1992) ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]''.  New York: Knopf. pp.766-67 {{ISBN|0-394-58601-8}}</ref> Roosevelt's desire to help the UK, despite the objections of the influential US [[isolationism|isolationist]] lobby, and [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|legal impediments]] imposed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] which prevented direct involvement in the war, brought the US to push hard against the traditional boundaries of [[Neutral country|neutrality]].\n\nOn 7 December 1941, the Empire of Japan launched an [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the US naval and army base on Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]], beginning a war between Japan and the United States. Japan had not informed its ally, Germany, in advance of the attack, although the Japanese ambassador had informed the German Foreign Minister, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], at the beginning of December that relations between the US and the Japanese Empire were at a breaking point, and that war was imminent.  He was instructed to ask Germany for commitment to declare war under the terms of the [[Tripartite Pact]] should that occur.  Hitler and Ribbentrop had been urging Japan to attack and take over [[Singapore]] from the British, on the theory that doing so would not only hurt the UK, but would also serve to help keep the US out of the war.<ref name=bullock661>[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]] (1962) ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'' London: Penguin. pp.661-64. {{ISBN|0-14-013564-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B06275A, Berlin, Reichstagssitzung, Rede Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|right|235px|Closeup of Hitler as war is declared upon the United States, 11 December 1941]]\nAccording to the terms of their agreements, Germany was obliged to come to the aid of Japan if a third country attacked Japan, but not if Japan attacked a third country. Ribbentrop reminded Hitler of this, and pointed out that to declare war against the US would add to the number of enemies Germany was fighting, but Hitler dismissed this concern as not being important,<ref name=bullock661 /> and, almost entirely without consultation, chose to declare war against the US, wanting to do so before, he thought, Roosevelt would declare war on Germany.<ref>Kershaw (2007), pp.444-446</ref><ref name=fest655 /><ref name=burleigh731 />\n\nIn fact, Hitler's declaration of war came as a great relief to British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who feared the possibility of two parallel but disconnected wars &ndash; the UK and Soviet Union versus Germany in Europe, and the US and the British Empire versus Japan in the Far East and the Pacific. With Nazi Germany's declaration against the United States in effect, American assistance for Britain in both theaters of war as a full ally was assured.  It also simplified matters for the American government, as [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] recalled:\n\n<blockquote>When Pearl Harbor happened, we [Roosevelt's advisors] were desperate. ... We were all in agony.  The mood of the American people was obvious &ndash; they were determined that the Japanese had to be punished.  We could have been forced to concentrate all our efforts on the Pacific, unable from then on to give more than purely peripheral help to Britain. It was truly astounding when Hitler declared war on us three days later. I cannot tell you our feelings of triumph.  It was a totally irrational thing for him to do, and I think it saved Europe.\"<ref>[[John Kenneth Galbraith|Galbraith, John Kenneth]], interviewed by [[Gitta Sereny]] (1995) ''Albert Speer: His Battle with the Truth'' New York, Knopf. p.267-8. {{ISBN|0-394-52915-4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHitler's reasons for declaring war against the US when he was not obligated to were numerous. One was an emotional response: the Japanese tactic of using a surprise attack without making a declaration of war appealed to him &ndash; he had done the same thing when he attacked the [[Soviet Union]] with [[Operation Barbarossa]] in June 1941; indeed, he told the Japanese ambassador \"[O]ne should strike &ndash; as hard as possible &ndash; and not waste time declaring war.\"<ref name=bullock661 />  Also, the prospect of a worldwide war fed Hitler's tendency towards grandiose thinking, and reinforced his feeling that he was a world-historical figure of destiny.  As he said in his declaration speech to the Reichstag:\n\n<blockquote>I can only be grateful to Providence that it entrusted me with the leadership in this historic struggle which, for the next five hundred or a thousand years, will be described as decisive, not only for the history of Germany, but for the whole of Europe and indeed the whole world.<ref name=bullock661 /></blockquote>\n\nHitler's lack of knowledge about the US and its industrial and demographic capacity for mounting a war on two fronts also entered into his decision.<ref name=bullock661 /> As early as mid-March 1941 &ndash; nine months before the Japanese attack &ndash; President Roosevelt was acutely aware of Hitler's hostility towards the United States, and [[New Order (Nazism)#Hitler's plans for North America|the destructive potential it presented]]. Due to this attitude within the [[White House]], and the rapidly progressing efforts of the Americans' industrial capacity before and through 1941 to start providing its armed forces with the ordnance, combat aircraft and ships that would be required to defeat the Axis as a whole, the US was already well on its way towards the full-scale wartime economy which would make it the [[Arsenal of Democracy|\"arsenal of democracy\"]] for itself and its allies.\n\nFinally, Hitler's deeply-held racial prejudices made him see the US as a decadent bourgeois democracy filled with people of mixed race, a population heavily under the influence of Jews and \"Negroes\", with no history of authoritarian discipline to control and direct them, interested only in luxury and living the \"good life\" while dancing, drinking and enjoying \"negrofied\" music.  Such a country, in Hitler's mind, would never be willing to make the economic and human sacrifices necessary to threaten National Socialist Germany<ref name=bullock661 /> \u2014 and thus set the stage for a dangerously inaccurate view of the very nation that Hitler had stated in his unpublished ''[[Zweites Buch]]'' (''Second Book'', 1928) would be the Third Reich's most serious challenge beyond his intended defeat of the Soviet Union.<ref>Hillgruber (1981), pp.50-51</ref>\n\nThe economic potential and racial composition of America had implications for Hitler's own ideological construct, indeed, how he saw Germany's current problems and future hopes. His central ideas of [[Lebensraum|'living space']] and race held the key to his image of the United States. To Hitler the United States was a country with a white 'Nordic' racial core, to which he attributed its economic success and standard of living, and in which he saw a model for his vision of German 'living space' in Europe.<ref>As late as 24 February 1945, Hitler spoke of the 'vast territory' of the United States in America, 'ample to absorb the energies of all their people', as the model which he hoped to emulate for Germany in Europe, 'to ensure for her complete economic independence inside a territory of a size compatible with her population', adding that 'a great people has need of broad acres' Genoud, Francois (ed.)

Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s signing of the declaration of war against Germany, the response of the United States to Hitler's declaration]]\n\nThe one advantage which the declaration of war against the US provided for Hitler was as a propaganda diversion for the German public, to distract them from the state of the war against the Soviet Union, in which Germany had suffered severe setbacks and an unexpectedly prolonged engagement.  Hitler had assured the German people that the Soviet Union would be crushed well before the onset of winter, but that, in fact, did not happen, and there was little in the way of good news. The timing of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor enabled Hitler to angle his planned speech to the Reichstag in a more positive fashion, squeezing as much propaganda value out of it as possible.  Hitler, in fact, put off the speech &ndash; and the declaration of war &ndash; for several days, trying to arrive at the proper psychological moment to make the announcement.<ref>Kershaw (2000), pp.444-45</ref>  Still, the propaganda motive was hardly sufficient to justify declaring war on the US, especially considering that doing so would create an otherwise \"unnatural alliance\" between two disparate and heretofore antagonistic polities, the United States and the Soviet Union.  [[Joachim C. Fest]], one of Hitler's biographers, has argued that Hitler's decision was \"really no longer an act of his own volition, but a gesture governed by a sudden awareness of his own impotence. That gesture was Hitler's last strategic initiative of any importance.\"<ref name=fest655 />\n\nRegardless of Hitler's reasons for the declaration, the decision is generally seen as an enormous strategic blunder on his part, as it allowed the United States to enter the European war in support of the United Kingdom and the Allies without much public opposition, while still facing the Japanese threat in the Pacific. Hitler had, in fact, committed Germany to fight the US while in the midst of a war of extermination against Russia, and without having first defeated the UK, instead of taking the option of putting off a conflict with the US for as long as possible, forcing it to concentrate on the war in the Pacific against Japan, and making it much more difficult for it to become involved in the European war.  At least to some extent he had held in his hands the power to control the timing of the intervention of the US, and instead, by declaring war against America, he freed Roosevelt and Churchill to act as they saw fit.<ref name=bullock /><ref name=fest655>[[Joachim C.

His admission...on January 3, 1942, that he did 'not yet' know 'how America could be defeated' speaks for itself.\"</ref>\n\nFrom the point of view of Hitler and much of the German political and military elite, declaring war against the U.S. in response to the Pearl Harbor attack was a calculated risk in fighting the U.S. before they were prepared to effectively defend themselves.  By that time, the German leadership believed that the United States was effectively acting as a belligerent in the conflict, given actions such as Lend-Lease of supplies to Britain to sustain their war effort, President Roosevelt's public statements, the deployment of American soldiers and Marines to Iceland, and U.S. Navy escorts of convoys across the Atlantic, which sometimes came into contact with U-boats; these acts, as well as America's previous intervention in [[World War I]], led to the assumption that war between them was inevitable.  As such, the decision was made to use the attack as a rationale for an official declaration of war in order to drive Britain out of the conflict by widening submarine operations and directly attacking U.S. commercial shipping.  While Hitler's declaration of war against the United States eventually led to his downfall, initially it seemed successful in its objective of more effectively cutting Britain's supply lines, as the U.S. military's lack of tactics, equipment, and procedures for fighting U-boats caused 1942 to be the most devastating year of the war for shipping losses;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-if-hitler-never-declared-war-the-us-during-world-war-ii-17573 |title=What If Hitler Never Declared War on the U.S. During World War II?|last1=Farley |first1=Robert |date=2 September 2016 |website=National Interest.org |publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> the war declaration enabled the [[Second Happy Time]] for U-boats.<ref>Duncan Redford and Grove, Philip D.

Peter Padfield writes:\n\n<blockquote>The news [of Pearl Harbor] came as a surprise to Hitler although he knew of their intention to attack somewhere at some time and had made up his mind to support them if they attacked the United States.  Now frivolously disregarding the huge financial and productive power of America and, according to ... von Puttkamer, blind to the realization that this power could be projected across the Atlantic, he gained renewed confidence in a victorious outcome to the war.  His generals suffered from the same land-locked hallucination: his entire headquarters staff gave themselves up to 'an ecstasy of rejoicing'; the few who saw further 'became even lonelier'. Naval officers saw no more clearly than the generals.<ref>Padfield, Peter (1984) ''D\u00f6nitz: The Last Fuhrer: Portrait of a Nazi War Leader'' London: Victor Gollancz. {{ISBN|0-575-03186-7}}. p.235; quoting Warlimont, W.

The time selected was 3:00 pm, as it was a convenient time for German radio listeners and the broadcast could be received in Tokyo at 10 pm and in Washington DC at 8:00 am. Ribbentrop telephoned the German ambassador in Rome, asking him to contact Mussolini and ensure that Italy's declaration of war be coordinated with Germany's. Meanwhile, there was considerable diplomatic activity to ensure that the amendments to the Tripartite Pact requested by the Japanese government be concluded; the Germans requested that the Japanese ambassador, [[Hiroshi \u014cshima]], should be empowered to sign the [[Tripartite Pact#\"No separate peace\" agreement|\"No separate peace\" agreement]] on Tokyo's behalf to save time.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 236</ref>\n\nBritain and the United States were already aware of German intentions through [[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]] signals intelligence and on 9 December, Roosevelt gave one of his \"[[fireside chats|fireside chat]]\" national broadcasts in which he said that American people should \"Remember always that Germany and Italy, regardless of any formal declaration of war, consider themselves at war with the United States at this moment just as much as they consider themselves at war with Britain or Russia\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 223-225</ref> Churchill spoke in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on the morning of 11 December, saying that; \"Not only the British Empire now but the United States are fighting for life; Russia is fighting for life, and China is fighting for life.

In his speech of October 27, 1941, he once more expressly affirmed that this order was in force. Acting under this order, vessels of the American Navy, since early September 1941, have systematically attacked German naval forces. Thus, American [[destroyers]], as for instance the [[USS Greer (DD-145)|Greer]], the [[USS Kearny (DD-432)|Kearney]] and the [[USS Reuben James (DD-245)|Reuben James]], have opened fire on German submarines according to plan. The [[Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the American Navy]], Mr. [[Frank Knox|Knox]], himself confirmed that-American destroyers attacked German [[submarines]].\n\nFurthermore, the naval forces of the United States, under order of their Government and contrary to international law have treated and seized German [[Merchant ship|merchant vessels]] on the high seas as enemy ships.\n\nThe German Government therefore establishes the following facts:\n\nAlthough Germany on her part has strictly adhered to the rules of international law in her relations with the United States during every period of the [[World War II|present war]], the Government of the United States from initial violations of neutrality has finally proceeded to open acts of war against Germany. The Government of the United States has thereby virtually created a [[Declaration of war|state of war]].\n\nThe German Government, consequently, discontinues [[diplomatic relations]] with the United States of America and declares that under these circumstances brought about by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] Germany too, as from today, considers herself as being in a state of war with the United States of America.\n\nAccept, Mr. Charge d'Affaires, the expression of my high consideration.\n\nDecember 11, 1941.\n\nRIBBENTROP.<ref>{{cite web|title=German Declaration of War with the United States : December 11, 1941|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/gerdec41.asp|work=The Avalon Project|publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe same text had been sent to [[Hans Thomsen]], the German ''charg\u00e9 d'affaires'' in Washington, with instructions to present it to [[Cordell Hull]], the [[United States Secretary of State]] at 3:30 pm, German [[summer time]], 8:30 am [[Eastern Standard Time]].<ref>Smyth & Lambert 1964, p. 999</ref> On their arrival however, Hull refused to see the German delegation and it was not until 9:30 that they were able pass their note to [[Ray Atherton]], the head of the Division of European Affairs.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 253</ref> In Berlin, there was consternation that Mussolini had decided to preempt Hitler and declare war in a speech from the balcony at the [[Palazzo Venezia]] at 2:45 pm; an estimated crowd of 100,000 gathered to hear his speech which lasted only four minutes.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 248-249</ref>\n\nAt 3:00 pm, Hitler addressed the 855 deputies of the Reichstag gathered in the [[Kroll Opera House]], with a speech lasting for 88 minutes in which he listed German successes to date but failed to mention the stalled offensive in Russia. The second part of the speech was devoted to an attack on Roosevelt and the \"the Anglo-Saxon Jewish-capitalist world\", concluding that \"In the 2,000 years of German history known to us, our ''Volk'' has never been more unified and united than it is today\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 250-253</ref> On the same day, German ambassadors in the capitals of the other Tripartite Pact signatories; [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]], were instructed to obtain their declarations of war against the United States.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 253</ref>\n\nRoosevelt had written a brief note to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on the morning of 11 December asking them to declare war on Germany and Italy; meeting at noon, the motion passed through both houses without dissent, although there were some abstentions.

The decision to declare war was made by [[Adolf Hitler]], apparently offhand, almost without consultation. Publicly, the formal declaration was made to American ''Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires'' [[Leland B. Morris]] by German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] in the latter's office. Later that day, the [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1941)|U.S. declared war on Germany]].\n\nWidely considered a major error in the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[dictatorship]]'s strategic actions during the war, the Nazi hierarchy held low regard for the military resolve of the U.S. under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Through the eyes of the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[ideology]] practiced by Hitler and other senior Nazis, the U.S. constituted a [[Corruption|corrupt]], [[Decadence|decadent]], and fundamentally weak nation given factors such as the large population of [[African-Americans]], [[immigrants]] and [[Jewish-Americans]] as well as the free-for-all nature of U.S. [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Consequences of the attack on Pearl Harbor}}\nThe course of relations between Germany and the United States had deteriorated since the beginning of World War II, inevitably so given the increasing cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], [[Lend-Lease]], the [[Atlantic Charter]], the [[Occupation of Iceland#United States occupation|hand-over of military control of Iceland from the United Kingdom to the United States]], the extension of the [[Pan-American Security Zone]], and many other results of the [[Special Relationship|special relationship]] which had developed between the two countries had put a strain on relations between the US, still technically a neutral country, and [[Nazi Germany]]. US destroyers escorting American supply vessels bound for the UK were already engaged in a ''de facto'' war with German [[U-Boats]].<ref name=bullock>[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]] (1992) ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]''.  New York: Knopf. pp.766-67 {{ISBN|0-394-58601-8}}</ref> Roosevelt's desire to help the UK, despite the objections of the influential US [[isolationism|isolationist]] lobby, and [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|legal impediments]] imposed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] which prevented direct involvement in the war, brought the US to push hard against the traditional boundaries of [[Neutral country|neutrality]].\n\nOn 7 December 1941, the Empire of Japan launched an [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on the US naval and army base on Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]], beginning a war between Japan and the United States. Japan had not informed its ally, Germany, in advance of the attack, although the Japanese ambassador had informed the German Foreign Minister, [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], at the beginning of December that relations between the US and the Japanese Empire were at a breaking point, and that war was imminent.  He was instructed to ask Germany for commitment to declare war under the terms of the [[Tripartite Pact]] should that occur.  Hitler and Ribbentrop had been urging Japan to attack and take over [[Singapore]] from the British, on the theory that doing so would not only hurt the UK, but would also serve to help keep the US out of the war.<ref name=bullock661>[[Alan Bullock|Bullock, Alan]] (1962) ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'' London: Penguin. pp.661-64. {{ISBN|0-14-013564-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B06275A, Berlin, Reichstagssitzung, Rede Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|right|235px|Closeup of Hitler as war is declared upon the United States, 11 December 1941]]\nAccording to the terms of their agreements, Germany was obliged to come to the aid of Japan if a third country attacked Japan, but not if Japan attacked a third country. Ribbentrop reminded Hitler of this, and pointed out that to declare war against the US would add to the number of enemies Germany was fighting, but Hitler dismissed this concern as not being important,<ref name=bullock661 /> and, almost entirely without consultation, chose to declare war against the US, wanting to do so before, he thought, Roosevelt would declare war on Germany.<ref>Kershaw (2007), pp.444-446</ref><ref name=fest655 /><ref name=burleigh731 />\n\nIn fact, Hitler's declaration of war came as a great relief to British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who feared the possibility of two parallel but disconnected wars &ndash; the UK and Soviet Union versus Germany in Europe, and the US and the British Empire versus Japan in the Far East and the Pacific. With Nazi Germany's declaration against the United States in effect, American assistance for Britain in both theaters of war as a full ally was assured.  It also simplified matters for the American government, as [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] recalled:\n\n<blockquote>When Pearl Harbor happened, we [Roosevelt's advisors] were desperate. ... We were all in agony.  The mood of the American people was obvious &ndash; they were determined that the Japanese had to be punished.  We could have been forced to concentrate all our efforts on the Pacific, unable from then on to give more than purely peripheral help to Britain. It was truly astounding when Hitler declared war on us three days later. I cannot tell you our feelings of triumph.  It was a totally irrational thing for him to do, and I think it saved Europe.\"<ref>[[John Kenneth Galbraith|Galbraith, John Kenneth]], interviewed by [[Gitta Sereny]] (1995) ''Albert Speer: His Battle with the Truth'' New York, Knopf. p.267-8. {{ISBN|0-394-52915-4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHitler's reasons for declaring war against the US when he was not obligated to were numerous. One was an emotional response: the Japanese tactic of using a surprise attack without making a declaration of war appealed to him &ndash; he had done the same thing when he attacked the [[Soviet Union]] with [[Operation Barbarossa]] in June 1941; indeed, he told the Japanese ambassador \"[O]ne should strike &ndash; as hard as possible &ndash; and not waste time declaring war.\"<ref name=bullock661 />  Also, the prospect of a worldwide war fed Hitler's tendency towards grandiose thinking, and reinforced his feeling that he was a world-historical figure of destiny.  As he said in his declaration speech to the Reichstag:\n\n<blockquote>I can only be grateful to Providence that it entrusted me with the leadership in this historic struggle which, for the next five hundred or a thousand years, will be described as decisive, not only for the history of Germany, but for the whole of Europe and indeed the whole world.<ref name=bullock661 /></blockquote>\n\nHitler's lack of knowledge about the US and its industrial and demographic capacity for mounting a war on two fronts also entered into his decision.<ref name=bullock661 /> As early as mid-March 1941 &ndash; nine months before the Japanese attack &ndash; President Roosevelt was acutely aware of Hitler's hostility towards the United States, and [[New Order (Nazism)#Hitler's plans for North America|the destructive potential it presented]]. Due to this attitude within the [[White House]], and the rapidly progressing efforts of the Americans' industrial capacity before and through 1941 to start providing its armed forces with the ordnance, combat aircraft and ships that would be required to defeat the Axis as a whole, the US was already well on its way towards the full-scale wartime economy which would make it the [[Arsenal of Democracy|\"arsenal of democracy\"]] for itself and its allies.\n\nFinally, Hitler's deeply-held racial prejudices made him see the US as a decadent bourgeois democracy filled with people of mixed race, a population heavily under the influence of Jews and \"Negroes\", with no history of authoritarian discipline to control and direct them, interested only in luxury and living the \"good life\" while dancing, drinking and enjoying \"negrofied\" music.  Such a country, in Hitler's mind, would never be willing to make the economic and human sacrifices necessary to threaten National Socialist Germany<ref name=bullock661 /> \u2014 and thus set the stage for a dangerously inaccurate view of the very nation that Hitler had stated in his unpublished ''[[Zweites Buch]]'' (''Second Book'', 1928) would be the Third Reich's most serious challenge beyond his intended defeat of the Soviet Union.<ref>Hillgruber (1981), pp.50-51</ref>\n\nThe economic potential and racial composition of America had implications for Hitler's own ideological construct, indeed, how he saw Germany's current problems and future hopes. His central ideas of [[Lebensraum|'living space']] and race held the key to his image of the United States. To Hitler the United States was a country with a white 'Nordic' racial core, to which he attributed its economic success and standard of living, and in which he saw a model for his vision of German 'living space' in Europe.<ref>As late as 24 February 1945, Hitler spoke of the 'vast territory' of the United States in America, 'ample to absorb the energies of all their people', as the model which he hoped to emulate for Germany in Europe, 'to ensure for her complete economic independence inside a territory of a size compatible with her population', adding that 'a great people has need of broad acres' Genoud, Francois (ed.)

Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s signing of the declaration of war against Germany, the response of the United States to Hitler's declaration]]\n\nThe one advantage which the declaration of war against the US provided for Hitler was as a propaganda diversion for the German public, to distract them from the state of the war against the Soviet Union, in which Germany had suffered severe setbacks and an unexpectedly prolonged engagement.  Hitler had assured the German people that the Soviet Union would be crushed well before the onset of winter, but that, in fact, did not happen, and there was little in the way of good news. The timing of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor enabled Hitler to angle his planned speech to the Reichstag in a more positive fashion, squeezing as much propaganda value out of it as possible.  Hitler, in fact, put off the speech &ndash; and the declaration of war &ndash; for several days, trying to arrive at the proper psychological moment to make the announcement.<ref>Kershaw (2000), pp.444-45</ref>  Still, the propaganda motive was hardly sufficient to justify declaring war on the US, especially considering that doing so would create an otherwise \"unnatural alliance\" between two disparate and heretofore antagonistic polities, the United States and the Soviet Union.  [[Joachim C. Fest]], one of Hitler's biographers, has argued that Hitler's decision was \"really no longer an act of his own volition, but a gesture governed by a sudden awareness of his own impotence. That gesture was Hitler's last strategic initiative of any importance.\"<ref name=fest655 />\n\nRegardless of Hitler's reasons for the declaration, the decision is generally seen as an enormous strategic blunder on his part, as it allowed the United States to enter the European war in support of the United Kingdom and the Allies without much public opposition, while still facing the Japanese threat in the Pacific. Hitler had, in fact, committed Germany to fight the US while in the midst of a war of extermination against Russia, and without having first defeated the UK, instead of taking the option of putting off a conflict with the US for as long as possible, forcing it to concentrate on the war in the Pacific against Japan, and making it much more difficult for it to become involved in the European war.  At least to some extent he had held in his hands the power to control the timing of the intervention of the US, and instead, by declaring war against America, he freed Roosevelt and Churchill to act as they saw fit.<ref name=bullock /><ref name=fest655>[[Joachim C.

Quote: \"Hitler's declaration of war on the United States ... was not an objective foreign policy move. ... Rather, it was a gesture designed to conceal the fact that he could no longer control the direction of the war... His admission...on January 3, 1942, that he did 'not yet' know 'how America could be defeated' speaks for itself.\"</ref>\n\nFrom the point of view of Hitler and much of the German political and military elite, declaring war against the U.S. in response to the Pearl Harbor attack was a calculated risk in fighting the U.S. before they were prepared to effectively defend themselves.  By that time, the German leadership believed that the United States was effectively acting as a belligerent in the conflict, given actions such as Lend-Lease of supplies to Britain to sustain their war effort, President Roosevelt's public statements, the deployment of American soldiers and Marines to Iceland, and U.S. Navy escorts of convoys across the Atlantic, which sometimes came into contact with U-boats; these acts, as well as America's previous intervention in [[World War I]], led to the assumption that war between them was inevitable.  As such, the decision was made to use the attack as a rationale for an official declaration of war in order to drive Britain out of the conflict by widening submarine operations and directly attacking U.S. commercial shipping.  While Hitler's declaration of war against the United States eventually led to his downfall, initially it seemed successful in its objective of more effectively cutting Britain's supply lines, as the U.S. military's lack of tactics, equipment, and procedures for fighting U-boats caused 1942 to be the most devastating year of the war for shipping losses;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-if-hitler-never-declared-war-the-us-during-world-war-ii-17573 |title=What If Hitler Never Declared War on the U.S. During World War II?|last1=Farley |first1=Robert |date=2 September 2016 |website=National Interest.org |publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> the war declaration enabled the [[Second Happy Time]] for U-boats.<ref>Duncan Redford and Grove, Philip D. (2014) ''The Royal Navy: A History Since 1900'', Tauris. p.182</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's Naval Adjutant, Admiral von Puttkamer, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor actually buoyed Hitler's assurance in winning the war, and improved morale among the high leadership of the armed forces. Peter Padfield writes:\n\n<blockquote>The news [of Pearl Harbor] came as a surprise to Hitler although he knew of their intention to attack somewhere at some time and had made up his mind to support them if they attacked the United States.  Now frivolously disregarding the huge financial and productive power of America and, according to ... von Puttkamer, blind to the realization that this power could be projected across the Atlantic, he gained renewed confidence in a victorious outcome to the war.  His generals suffered from the same land-locked hallucination: his entire headquarters staff gave themselves up to 'an ecstasy of rejoicing'; the few who saw further 'became even lonelier'. Naval officers saw no more clearly than the generals.<ref>Padfield, Peter (1984) ''D\u00f6nitz: The Last Fuhrer: Portrait of a Nazi War Leader'' London: Victor Gollancz. {{ISBN|0-575-03186-7}}. p.235; quoting Warlimont, W.

The time selected was 3:00 pm, as it was a convenient time for German radio listeners and the broadcast could be received in Tokyo at 10 pm and in Washington DC at 8:00 am. Ribbentrop telephoned the German ambassador in Rome, asking him to contact Mussolini and ensure that Italy's declaration of war be coordinated with Germany's. Meanwhile, there was considerable diplomatic activity to ensure that the amendments to the Tripartite Pact requested by the Japanese government be concluded; the Germans requested that the Japanese ambassador, [[Hiroshi \u014cshima]], should be empowered to sign the [[Tripartite Pact#\"No separate peace\" agreement|\"No separate peace\" agreement]] on Tokyo's behalf to save time.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 236</ref>\n\nBritain and the United States were already aware of German intentions through [[Magic (cryptography)|Magic]] signals intelligence and on 9 December, Roosevelt gave one of his \"[[fireside chats|fireside chat]]\" national broadcasts in which he said that American people should \"Remember always that Germany and Italy, regardless of any formal declaration of war, consider themselves at war with the United States at this moment just as much as they consider themselves at war with Britain or Russia\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 223-225</ref> Churchill spoke in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on the morning of 11 December, saying that; \"Not only the British Empire now but the United States are fighting for life; Russia is fighting for life, and China is fighting for life. Behind these four great combatant communities are ranged all the free spirit and hopes of all the conquered countries in Europe...  It would indeed bring shame upon our generation if we did not teach them a lesson which will not be forgotten in the records of a thousand years\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 247</ref>\n\nOn Thursday 11 December 1941, American ''Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires'' [[Leland B. Morris]], the highest ranking American diplomat in Germany, was summoned to Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]'s office where Ribbentrop read Morris the formal declaration;<ref name=DIC>{{cite book  | last =Read  | first =Anthony  | title =The Devil's Disciples: Hitler's Inner Circle  | publisher =[[W.

CHARGE D'AFFAIRES:\n\nThe Government of the United States having violated in the most flagrant manner and in ever increasing measure all rules of [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in favor of the adversaries of Germany and having continually been guilty of the most severe provocations toward Germany ever since the outbreak of the European war, provoked by the [[Neville Chamberlain#Declaration of war|British declaration of war against Germany]] on September 3, 1939, has finally resorted to open military acts of aggression.\n\nOn September 11, 1941, the [[President of the United States]] publicly declared that he had ordered the American Navy and Air Force to shoot on sight at any German war vessel. In his speech of October 27, 1941, he once more expressly affirmed that this order was in force. Acting under this order, vessels of the American Navy, since early September 1941, have systematically attacked German naval forces. Thus, American [[destroyers]], as for instance the [[USS Greer (DD-145)|Greer]], the [[USS Kearny (DD-432)|Kearney]] and the [[USS Reuben James (DD-245)|Reuben James]], have opened fire on German submarines according to plan. The [[Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the American Navy]], Mr. [[Frank Knox|Knox]], himself confirmed that-American destroyers attacked German [[submarines]].\n\nFurthermore, the naval forces of the United States, under order of their Government and contrary to international law have treated and seized German [[Merchant ship|merchant vessels]] on the high seas as enemy ships.\n\nThe German Government therefore establishes the following facts:\n\nAlthough Germany on her part has strictly adhered to the rules of international law in her relations with the United States during every period of the [[World War II|present war]], the Government of the United States from initial violations of neutrality has finally proceeded to open acts of war against Germany. The Government of the United States has thereby virtually created a [[Declaration of war|state of war]].\n\nThe German Government, consequently, discontinues [[diplomatic relations]] with the United States of America and declares that under these circumstances brought about by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] Germany too, as from today, considers herself as being in a state of war with the United States of America.\n\nAccept, Mr. Charge d'Affaires, the expression of my high consideration.\n\nDecember 11, 1941.\n\nRIBBENTROP.<ref>{{cite web|title=German Declaration of War with the United States : December 11, 1941|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/gerdec41.asp|work=The Avalon Project|publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe same text had been sent to [[Hans Thomsen]], the German ''charg\u00e9 d'affaires'' in Washington, with instructions to present it to [[Cordell Hull]], the [[United States Secretary of State]] at 3:30 pm, German [[summer time]], 8:30 am [[Eastern Standard Time]].<ref>Smyth & Lambert 1964, p. 999</ref> On their arrival however, Hull refused to see the German delegation and it was not until 9:30 that they were able pass their note to [[Ray Atherton]], the head of the Division of European Affairs.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 253</ref> In Berlin, there was consternation that Mussolini had decided to preempt Hitler and declare war in a speech from the balcony at the [[Palazzo Venezia]] at 2:45 pm; an estimated crowd of 100,000 gathered to hear his speech which lasted only four minutes.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 248-249</ref>\n\nAt 3:00 pm, Hitler addressed the 855 deputies of the Reichstag gathered in the [[Kroll Opera House]], with a speech lasting for 88 minutes in which he listed German successes to date but failed to mention the stalled offensive in Russia. The second part of the speech was devoted to an attack on Roosevelt and the \"the Anglo-Saxon Jewish-capitalist world\", concluding that \"In the 2,000 years of German history known to us, our ''Volk'' has never been more unified and united than it is today\".<ref>Mawdsley 2011, pp. 250-253</ref> On the same day, German ambassadors in the capitals of the other Tripartite Pact signatories; [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]], were instructed to obtain their declarations of war against the United States.<ref>Mawdsley 2011, p. 253</ref>\n\nRoosevelt had written a brief note to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on the morning of 11 December asking them to declare war on Germany and Italy; meeting at noon, the motion passed through both houses without dissent, although there were some abstentions.
