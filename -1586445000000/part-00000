NJG 1 was formed on 22 June 1940 in [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]].\nBy the end of the war it was the most successful night fighter unit and had claimed some 2,311 victories by day and night, for some 676 aircrew killed in action.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=239}}\n\n== Background==\n[[Night fighter]] operations did not feature in [[Wehrmacht]] [[war games]] during 1935 and 1936. Little of the Luftwaffe Service Regulation No. 16 concerned night fighting save for Section 253, which called for night fighting zones to be established, so that night fighters and [[anti-aircraft artillery]] did not interfere with each other. [[Search light]]s were to be utilised in support of the pilots. Section 253 concluded that any hinderance to offensive air forces caused by \"restrictive measures\" was to be avoided. The prevailing attitude to night fighting left commanders on the ground to carry out research on their own; the first occurred in [[Berlin]], by ''Luftkreiskommando'' II from May to November 1936. The [[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]] ordered experimenting with searchlights and aircraft from the summer, 1937. In 1939 several night fighter ''staffeln'' (squadrons or flights) had been established; but all of these had been converted back to day fighter units by 16 August 1939.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10, 12}} \n\nThe [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 began [[World War II]] in [[Europe]]. The [[French Air Force]] and [[RAF Bomber Command]] began bombing raids on German ports and shipping. The [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]] in December 1939 ended [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) daylight operations until 1944. Bomber Command persisted in night operations against Germany, which extended to German towns and cities from 10/11 May 1940. The [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|capitulation of the Fench]] after the [[Battle of France]] did not end the threat posed by British air power.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10-16}}{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=41}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] commanded I/ZG 1 during the [[German invasion of Denmark]]. Immediately after the occupation, Bomber Command appeared frequently to attack German positions, and Falck was able to fly interceptions during [[dusk]]. Falck was sure that a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] unit could defend the airspace at night with assistance from [[radar]] operators. Falck was invited to the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|RLM]] to express his views to [[Albert Kesselring]], [[Ernst Udet]] and [[Erhard Milch]]. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, ordered Falck to created a ''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] on 22 June 1940.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=15-16}} \n\nFalck came to the conclusion, night fighting could not be organised and operated by one commanding officer of a single wing. In response, [[Josef Kammhuber]] formed the Night Fighter Division. Radar, search lights and anti-aircraft artillery were coordinated under this organisation at [[division (military)|division]]-level on 17 July 1940. On 23 July the headquarters was established at [[Brussels]], in occupied [[Belgium]]. On 1 August 1940 a command post was established at [[Zeist]] near [[Utrecht]] in the occupied [[Netherlands]]. The Zerst\u00f6rer pilots and units were used for conversion to night fighters. No night fighter training schools existed in 1940, until blind-flying schools were established at [[Schlei\u00dfheim]] from 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=16\u201317}} Kammhuber established the [[Kammhuber Line]], which evenutally allowed radar to guide night fighters to RAF bombers.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=17\u201329}}\n\n===Formation===\nI ''Gruppe'' was formed on 22 June 1940 from elements of I./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 1]] (ZG 1) and IV./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 26]] (ZG 26).  II ''Gruppe'' was formed from IV./(N)[[JG 2]] on 1 July 1940, although the ''Gruppe'' was redesignated III./NJG 1. The second formaction occurred the same date, 1 July, from renaming Z./[[Kampfgeschwader 30]] (''Zerst\u00f6rer''/KG 30). On 7 September 1940 this ''Gruppe'' were redesignated as I./[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2]] (NJG 2), though it received personnel from I/Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 26. III ''Gruppe'' was raised on 1 July also, from II/NJG 1. IV./NJG 1 was raised on 1 October 1942 from elements of II./NJG 2.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=224}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] became the first [[Geschwaderkommodore]].{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}} [[Hauptmann]] [[G\u00fcnther Radusch]], took command of I./NJG 1, [[Major]] [[Walter Ehle]], became the first permanent commander of II/NJG 1,  Hauptmann von Bothmer and Major [[Helmut Lent]] took command of III and IV./NJG 1 respectively.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=226\u2013227}}\n\nI/NJG 1 set up base at [[Venlo Airfield]], where to remained from 18 March 1941 to 5 September 1944. 18,000 workers worked on the site which measured 1,180 [[hectares]]. The two take-off runways were 1,450 mtres (4,760 ft) long, and a third 1,200 metres (3,940 feet) in length. 2,000 lamps were used for lighting and 48 km (29.8 miles) of roads led to workshops, command posts, and accommodation.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=29}} The formation of the night fighter wings brought together different kinds of pilots with different preferences. The crews of II/NJG 1, which were formed from Z/KG 30, preferred the [[Junkers Ju 88]], [[Dornier Do 17]] and [[Dornier Do 217]], which were regarded by Bf 110 pilots as \"lame ducks\" unsuitable for the role. These pilots preferred other qualities not prevalent in Zerstorer aircraft; spacious cockpits, a third man to act as lookout, longer endurance, auto-pilot, and more powerful armament. These pilots, in some cases, were advanced in years for a military aviator, often they were former [[Lufthansa]] pilots. These men did not adapt easily to the concept of controlled night fighting.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=27}}\n\n==World War II==\nIn the autumn, 1940 the Luftwaffe began long-range intruder operations (''Fernnachtjagd'') to forestall the intensified Bomber Command raids.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=17}} The Luftwaffe signalling service were able to determine when Bomber Command operations were going to begin. Night fighters were ordered to patrol the German coast, fly to known Bomber Command bases and follow the bombers back to [[England]] along known routes.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=30}} I/[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2]] became the sole intruder unit for this type of operation, but the results were expensive. The wing lost 32 aircrew [[killed in action]] and 12 aircraft lost in exchange for 18 RAF claimed shot down.{{sfn|Parry|2003|pp=31, 33, 35, 37}} Over Europe, the German defences were limited in 1941. The [[Nazi propaganda]] machine dismissed RAF bombers as \"tired old cows\", but the limited range of the precisie but short-ranged [[W\u00fcrzburg radar]], and the inability to distinguish friend from foe, left the Luftwaffe at a disadvanage. The ''Henaja'' belt, which provided three radars per searchlight battery, covered the area from the Danish border to [[Maubeuge]], and could detect bombers entering and exiting the zone with great accuracy, but RAF bomber pilots learned to dive upon departing the belt, accelerate past the search light batteries at low-altitudes and escape the most hazardous part of the defence zone. The system bore the burden of the defensive battles in 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=32-33}} In 1942, the introduction of the [[Handley-Page Halifax]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] would produce further problems. The bombers could outrun a Bf 110C or D in a shallow dive and at altitudes of over 5,000 m (16,400 ft). German pilots would have to detect the bomber in order to be able to dive from much greater heights.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=32}} The introduction of newer radar variants, such as the [[Freya radar]], eventually improved the range and identification problems prevelant in 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=33\u201354}}\n\nIn mid-1940, the Stab/NJG 1 was based at D\u00fcsseldorf and [[Deelen]] under Falck and equipped with three Bf 110Bs. At B\u00f6nninghardt, I/NJG 1 mustered 34 Bf 110Cs and Ds with 22 operational. At D\u00fcsseldorf, II/NJG 1 could field 11 Ju 88Cs, four operational, and 10 Do 17Zs, nine operational. At [[Cologne]], III/NJG 1 still operated the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]; 13 Bf 109Cs, four operational, three Bf 109Ds and one combat ready, 17 Bf 109Es were present with all but one operational.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2015|p=295}} On the night of 19/20 July, [[Werner Streib]], 2/NJG 1, claimed one of the first aerial victories for NJG 1; a [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley]] shot down at 02:15 near [[Saerbeck]]. Streib would become ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' II/NJG 1 only two months later.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=10}} Only 42 British bombers were claimed shot down in 1940 by German night fighters.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=239}} Streib claimed 22 aerial victories in 1941, making him the most successful night fighter pilot of the year. [[Paul Gildner]] claimed 21, and Lent claimed 20, making him the third highest claimant in the Luftwaffe that year.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} [[G\u00fcnther Radusch]], who spent several days commanding I/NJG 1 in 1940 during its formation, claimed 13.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=226, 240}} At the end of 1941 [[Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer]] joined the wing. Schnaufer would become the most successful night fighter pilot in history, with 121 claims.{{sfn|Spick|1996|pp=3\u20134}} \n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-659-6436-12, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 110.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bf 110G night fighter with radar. The 110 was the mainstay of NJG 1]]\nIn mid-1941 NJG 1 began experimenting with [[Lichtenstein radar]], which had become operational.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=40}} [[Ludwig Becker (pilot)|Ludwig Becker]] shot down six RAF bombers while flying a radar-installed [[Dornier Do 215]]B-5 between 10 August and 30 September 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=40}} The only Lichtenstein radar in service then became unserviceable for the next successes were not recorded until June 1942.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} Becker developed his own tactics for attacking a bomber. He stalked the aircraft from the stern, just below the height shown on the radar. After sighting the bomber, he dived and accelerated to avoid being spotted by the tail gunner. Once underneath the enemy, Becker reduced the throttle and matched the speed of the unsuspecting pilot. Becker then climbed steadily to 50 metres (164 metres) from below the target before he pulled up and opened fire. Because the Do 215 lost speed the bomber flew ahead and the through the stream of shells. With this method, the gun sight was rarely needed. These tactics were adopted by the night fighter force.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} The first Ju 88C fighters, equipped with radar were delivered to II./NJG 1 at [[Leeuwarden]] in February 1942. Only four sets arived and it took several weeks for them to become operational. The crews soon came to appreciate the device and were eager to secure it for their aircraft.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} Other platforms were tested in NJG 1 at this time. In March 1942 the [[Dornier Do 217]] J was also trialed in service with NJG 1; however the lack of performance made the type unpopular with crews.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=45\u201346}} \n\nIn February 1942, [[Air Marshall]] [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]] became [[Air Officer Commanding]] Bomber Command. Harris became the driving force behind producing a powerful [[heavy bomber]] command to carry out his [[area bombing]] operations. The attacks on [[Bombing of L\u00fcbeck in World War II|L\u00fcbeck in March]] and [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Cologne in May]] 1942 began the new phase in the [[Defence of the Reich]] campaign.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=41}} Over Lubeck, NJG 1 claimed only one bomber from seven claimed.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=42}} NJG 1 claimed 21 bombers during the latter attack on Cologne on 30/31 May 1942 from the 32 claimed by German night fighter units.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=42}} 41 bombers were lost.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=127}} Bomber Command began routine 1,000-bomber raids over Germany from 30 May to 17 August 1942 using the [[bomber stream]] to swap Kammhuber's defences. From August 1942, Bomber Command began introducing new navigation aids for its air fleets.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|pp=123\u2013178}} On 31 December 1942, Bomber Command utilised [[Pathfinder (RAF)|pathfinder]] [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s and Lancasters equipped with [[Oboe (navigation)|OBOE]] on a test raid to Dusseldorf.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=115}} Knacke made the last NJG 1 claim of the year against the latter type.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=63}} 1942 proved to be successful in a tactical sense for German night fighters. Lent led the claims for the year with 42, [[Reinhold Knacke]] claimed 40, as did Becker while Gildner claimed 38.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} On the night of the 16/17 September 1942 Knacke became the first night fighter to claim [[ace in a day]] status when he claimed five bombers.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=241}} In February 1943, one of the first major \"experts\", Becker was killed in action on a rare daylight interception against the [[United States Army Air Force]] (USAAF) [[Eighth Air Force]].{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=77}} Becker followed [[Helmut Woltersdorf]], killed in action in June 1942.{{sfn|Hinchliffe|1999|p=xi}}\n\n===Battle of the Ruhr,  Hamburg and Peenem\u00fcnde===\nIn March 1943, Harris began his first concerted [[military campaign]] against a specific objective, known as the [[Battle of the Ruhr]]. Harris had 53 squadrons for the battle, and his pathfinders were now operating the [[H2S (radar)|H2S ground-mapping radar]]. The Air Marshal felt he had sufficient resources for a long offensive against the German industrial region.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=69}} On 5 March 1943, Falck commanded the command ''staffel'' from Deelen, Streib commanded I ''Gruppe'' from Venlo, Thimmig commanded III ''Gruppe'' from [[Leeuwarden]] ,and Lent IV ''Gruppe'' from [[Twente]]; all operated the Bf 110. II ''Gruppe'' under Ehler at [[Sint-Truiden]] operated the Bf 110 and Do 217.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=69}}\n[[File:The German Air Force in the Second World War HU108216.jpg|thumb|left|Do 217J night fighter.

Among the claimants were fighter pilots [[Manfred Meurer]], [[Herbert L\u00fctje]], [[Heinz Vinke]] and Lent all claimed. On 12/13 March NJG 1 claimed 13, and repeated this again on 29/30 March. On 3/4 April the wing claimed 17. The success was not repeated until 27/28 April when its pilots submitted 10 claims.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=70-73, 76-77}} On 4/5 May NJG 1 claimed 24 bombers destroyed and was the only Luftwaffe unit to report any successes that night. Among the pilots was [[Hans-Dieter Frank]] who would claim 55 aerial victories and briefly command I/NJG 1 before his death in a collision with a colleague while flying a [[Heinkel He 219]]. The collision may have been caused by an attack on his fighter by [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Bob Braham]].{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=76-77}} On 12/13 May the wing claimed 25, and on 13/14 May the pilots claimed another 26.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=79-80}} On 23/24 May a further 23 were claimed.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=81-83}} The attacks on Dortmund that night cost Bomber Command 38 aircraft.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=163}} Over the next six days 58 bombers were claimed by the night of the 30/31 May.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=81-83}} The operation against [[Wuppertal]] on 29/30 May cost the British 33 aircraft.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=163}}  211 RAF bombers were claimed by NJG 1 in June 1943.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=84-91}} Total British losses were 277 for the month to all causes.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=141}} The Nazi [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], wrote in his diary on 14 May 1943 of German defences; \"during the night there was another exceptionally heavy raid on [[Duisburg]]....An unspeakable sorrow and great distress has come to the sorely tired city. Our technical development as regards [[submarine]] missions and air warfare is far inferior to that of the [[England|English]] and [[United States|American]]s. During the past five months the enemy has had the upper hand, almost everywhere he is defeating us in the air.\"{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=67}} \n\nBy the time the Ruhr campaign ended Bomber Command had suffered heavy losses to German night fighters and anti-aircraft defences. 1,099 were lost to all causes.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=141}} The Luftwaffe's defences were unable to prevent Bomber Command from severely disrupting German production. Steel production fell by 200,000 tons and the armaments industry was facing a steel shortfall of 400,000 tons.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=598}} After doubling production in 1942, production of steel increased only by 20 percent in 1943. [[Adolf Hitler]] and his armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] were forced to cut planned increases in production. This disruption caused the ''zulieferungskrise'' (sub-components crisis). The increase of aircraft production for the Luftwaffe also came to an abrupt halt. Monthly production failed to increase between July 1943 and March 1944. [[Adam Tooze]] concludes; \"Bomber Command had stopped Speer's armamanets miracle in its tracks.\"{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=598}} Production of [[locomotive]]s halted after March 1943 in the Ruhr along with ammunition fuses.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|pp=134\u2013135}} Over 100,000 people were [[dehoused]] in [[Essen]], contributing to the inability to continue production at the [[Krupp]] plant.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=135}}\n\nLuftwaffe night pilots experienced the presence of long-range RAF night fighting aircraft for the first time over Germany. Radar-installed [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s and [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s provided indirect [[fighter escort]] to Bomber Command over the Ruhr. These crews came from [[Fighter Command]], and termed their operations as \"flower\" [[sortie]]s. These tactics required RAF pilots to fly to known German night fighter airfields and patrol them in an effort to destroy the Luftwaffe interceptors as they got airborne or landed. These operations were successful and accounted for German aircraft losses in June.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|pp=90-94}} On 14 and 25 June 1943, NJG 1 lost one and two Bf 110s to RAF night fighters.{{sfn|Balss|1997|pp=157\u2013158}} In August 1943, Bomber Command's [[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation Hydra]] against [[Peenem\u00fcnde]]. Wing Commander Braham engaged two NJG 1 crews, the 15-victory ace Georg Kraft and another fighter ace [[Heinz Vinke]] and shot them both down, killing the former and wounding the latter.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=142}} Two other crews were lost on the operation.{{sfn|Middlebrook|2006|p=98}} A development of the raid was the recorded entry into II/NJG 1 war diary that it was to be converted to \"[[Wilde Sau|Wild Boar]]\" operations\u2014the use of radar-less [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] and [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] single-engine fighters piloted by experienced night flyers to attack bombers.{{sfn|Middlebrook|2006|pp=88-89}} [[Chief of the General Staff]], [[Hans Jeschonnek]] purportedly committed suicide because of the failure of night defences to repulse or prevent the attack.{{sfn|Middlebrook|2006|p=195}}\n\nOn 24 July 1943, days after the end of the Ruhr campaign, Harris ordered [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|\"Operation Gomorrah\"]], an attack on [[Hamburg]]. The objective was to disrupt or end [[U-boat]] production in the port city. The introduction of \"[[Chaff (countermeasure)|Window]]\" blew a hole in German radar coverage and the [[bomber stream]]s, aided by OBOE and H2S radar were able to penetrate the defences to devastate the centre of the city. The ''Himmelbett'' (canopy bed) system of radar-controlled night fighters slipping into the bomber stream and then using its own radar to pick out and engage individual bombers had gone. The effects of the raid, and the realisation German radar was temporarily blinded, led to the widespread use of the Wild Boar tactics over the summer, 1943.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=95}} 791 bombers hit the city. German air defences accounted for only 1.5 percent of the attacking force. The Nazi leadership was shaken, and Kammhuber, who resisted calls to abandon the advanced ''Himmelbett'' system, was compelled to find technical solutions to the jamming of Freya, Liechtenstein and W\u00fcrzburg radars. Kammhuber regarded the Wild Boar solution as an emergency measure only.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=94-96}} NJG 1 claimed only three from a total of 12 claimed by night fighter pilots in defence of the city\u2014[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 3]] claimed the rest.

[[Viktor von Lo\u00dfberg]]'s idea was for night fighters equipped with experimental SN-2 radar to cooperate with Y-control systems and \"sluice\" them into the bomber stream. Once there, the night fighters were ordered to transmit direction-finding signals to attract other night fighters. While unguided, the radar operators and night fighter command retained some control over operations with success in August amounting to 250 aircraft claimed shot down on all fronts. The success was offset by losses of 40 killed in the night fighter arm, with only 28 replacements in August. 61 twin-engine night fighters were lost, but only 59 were replaced.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=101\u2013104, 106}}\n\nOn 5 October 1943 NJG 1 with NJG 2 formed the [[1st Fighter Division (Germany)|1.

[[night fighter]]-[[Wing (air force unit)|wing]] of [[World War II]]. NJG 1 was formed on 22 June 1940 in [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]].\nBy the end of the war it was the most successful night fighter unit and had claimed some 2,311 victories by day and night, for some 676 aircrew killed in action.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=239}}\n\n== Background==\n[[Night fighter]] operations did not feature in [[Wehrmacht]] [[war games]] during 1935 and 1936. Little of the Luftwaffe Service Regulation No. 16 concerned night fighting save for Section 253, which called for night fighting zones to be established, so that night fighters and [[anti-aircraft artillery]] did not interfere with each other. [[Search light]]s were to be utilised in support of the pilots. Section 253 concluded that any hinderance to offensive air forces caused by \"restrictive measures\" was to be avoided. The prevailing attitude to night fighting left commanders on the ground to carry out research on their own; the first occurred in [[Berlin]], by ''Luftkreiskommando'' II from May to November 1936. The [[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]] ordered experimenting with searchlights and aircraft from the summer, 1937. In 1939 several night fighter ''staffeln'' (squadrons or flights) had been established; but all of these had been converted back to day fighter units by 16 August 1939.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10, 12}} \n\nThe [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 began [[World War II]] in [[Europe]]. The [[French Air Force]] and [[RAF Bomber Command]] began bombing raids on German ports and shipping. The [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]] in December 1939 ended [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) daylight operations until 1944. Bomber Command persisted in night operations against Germany, which extended to German towns and cities from 10/11 May 1940. The [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|capitulation of the Fench]] after the [[Battle of France]] did not end the threat posed by British air power.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10-16}}{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=41}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] commanded I/ZG 1 during the [[German invasion of Denmark]]. Immediately after the occupation, Bomber Command appeared frequently to attack German positions, and Falck was able to fly interceptions during [[dusk]]. Falck was sure that a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] unit could defend the airspace at night with assistance from [[radar]] operators. Falck was invited to the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|RLM]] to express his views to [[Albert Kesselring]], [[Ernst Udet]] and [[Erhard Milch]]. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, ordered Falck to created a ''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] on 22 June 1940.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=15-16}} \n\nFalck came to the conclusion, night fighting could not be organised and operated by one commanding officer of a single wing. In response, [[Josef Kammhuber]] formed the Night Fighter Division. Radar, search lights and anti-aircraft artillery were coordinated under this organisation at [[division (military)|division]]-level on 17 July 1940. On 23 July the headquarters was established at [[Brussels]], in occupied [[Belgium]]. On 1 August 1940 a command post was established at [[Zeist]] near [[Utrecht]] in the occupied [[Netherlands]]. The Zerst\u00f6rer pilots and units were used for conversion to night fighters. No night fighter training schools existed in 1940, until blind-flying schools were established at [[Schlei\u00dfheim]] from 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=16\u201317}} Kammhuber established the [[Kammhuber Line]], which evenutally allowed radar to guide night fighters to RAF bombers.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=17\u201329}}\n\n===Formation===\nI ''Gruppe'' was formed on 22 June 1940 from elements of I./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 1]] (ZG 1) and IV./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 26]] (ZG 26).  II ''Gruppe'' was formed from IV./(N)[[JG 2]] on 1 July 1940, although the ''Gruppe'' was redesignated III./NJG 1. The second formaction occurred the same date, 1 July, from renaming Z./[[Kampfgeschwader 30]] (''Zerst\u00f6rer''/KG 30). On 7 September 1940 this ''Gruppe'' were redesignated as I./[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2]] (NJG 2), though it received personnel from I/Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 26. III ''Gruppe'' was raised on 1 July also, from II/NJG 1. IV./NJG 1 was raised on 1 October 1942 from elements of II./NJG 2.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=224}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] became the first [[Geschwaderkommodore]].{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}} [[Hauptmann]] [[G\u00fcnther Radusch]], took command of I./NJG 1, [[Major]] [[Walter Ehle]], became the first permanent commander of II/NJG 1,  Hauptmann von Bothmer and Major [[Helmut Lent]] took command of III and IV./NJG 1 respectively.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=226\u2013227}}\n\nI/NJG 1 set up base at [[Venlo Airfield]], where to remained from 18 March 1941 to 5 September 1944. 18,000 workers worked on the site which measured 1,180 [[hectares]]. The two take-off runways were 1,450 mtres (4,760 ft) long, and a third 1,200 metres (3,940 feet) in length. 2,000 lamps were used for lighting and 48 km (29.8 miles) of roads led to workshops, command posts, and accommodation.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=29}} The formation of the night fighter wings brought together different kinds of pilots with different preferences. The crews of II/NJG 1, which were formed from Z/KG 30, preferred the [[Junkers Ju 88]], [[Dornier Do 17]] and [[Dornier Do 217]], which were regarded by Bf 110 pilots as \"lame ducks\" unsuitable for the role. These pilots preferred other qualities not prevalent in Zerstorer aircraft; spacious cockpits, a third man to act as lookout, longer endurance, auto-pilot, and more powerful armament. These pilots, in some cases, were advanced in years for a military aviator, often they were former [[Lufthansa]] pilots. These men did not adapt easily to the concept of controlled night fighting.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=27}}\n\n==World War II==\nIn the autumn, 1940 the Luftwaffe began long-range intruder operations (''Fernnachtjagd'') to forestall the intensified Bomber Command raids.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=17}} The Luftwaffe signalling service were able to determine when Bomber Command operations were going to begin. Night fighters were ordered to patrol the German coast, fly to known Bomber Command bases and follow the bombers back to [[England]] along known routes.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=30}} I/[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2]] became the sole intruder unit for this type of operation, but the results were expensive. The wing lost 32 aircrew [[killed in action]] and 12 aircraft lost in exchange for 18 RAF claimed shot down.{{sfn|Parry|2003|pp=31, 33, 35, 37}} Over Europe, the German defences were limited in 1941. The [[Nazi propaganda]] machine dismissed RAF bombers as \"tired old cows\", but the limited range of the precisie but short-ranged [[W\u00fcrzburg radar]], and the inability to distinguish friend from foe, left the Luftwaffe at a disadvanage. The ''Henaja'' belt, which provided three radars per searchlight battery, covered the area from the Danish border to [[Maubeuge]], and could detect bombers entering and exiting the zone with great accuracy, but RAF bomber pilots learned to dive upon departing the belt, accelerate past the search light batteries at low-altitudes and escape the most hazardous part of the defence zone. The system bore the burden of the defensive battles in 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=32-33}} In 1942, the introduction of the [[Handley-Page Halifax]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] would produce further problems. The bombers could outrun a Bf 110C or D in a shallow dive and at altitudes of over 5,000 m (16,400 ft). German pilots would have to detect the bomber in order to be able to dive from much greater heights.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=32}} The introduction of newer radar variants, such as the [[Freya radar]], eventually improved the range and identification problems prevelant in 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=33\u201354}}\n\nIn mid-1940, the Stab/NJG 1 was based at D\u00fcsseldorf and [[Deelen]] under Falck and equipped with three Bf 110Bs. At B\u00f6nninghardt, I/NJG 1 mustered 34 Bf 110Cs and Ds with 22 operational. At D\u00fcsseldorf, II/NJG 1 could field 11 Ju 88Cs, four operational, and 10 Do 17Zs, nine operational. At [[Cologne]], III/NJG 1 still operated the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]; 13 Bf 109Cs, four operational, three Bf 109Ds and one combat ready, 17 Bf 109Es were present with all but one operational.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2015|p=295}} On the night of 19/20 July, [[Werner Streib]], 2/NJG 1, claimed one of the first aerial victories for NJG 1; a [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley]] shot down at 02:15 near [[Saerbeck]]. Streib would become ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' II/NJG 1 only two months later.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=10}} Only 42 British bombers were claimed shot down in 1940 by German night fighters.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=239}} Streib claimed 22 aerial victories in 1941, making him the most successful night fighter pilot of the year. [[Paul Gildner]] claimed 21, and Lent claimed 20, making him the third highest claimant in the Luftwaffe that year.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} [[G\u00fcnther Radusch]], who spent several days commanding I/NJG 1 in 1940 during its formation, claimed 13.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=226, 240}} At the end of 1941 [[Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer]] joined the wing. Schnaufer would become the most successful night fighter pilot in history, with 121 claims.{{sfn|Spick|1996|pp=3\u20134}} \n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-659-6436-12, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 110.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bf 110G night fighter with radar. The 110 was the mainstay of NJG 1]]\nIn mid-1941 NJG 1 began experimenting with [[Lichtenstein radar]], which had become operational.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=40}} [[Ludwig Becker (pilot)|Ludwig Becker]] shot down six RAF bombers while flying a radar-installed [[Dornier Do 215]]B-5 between 10 August and 30 September 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=40}} The only Lichtenstein radar in service then became unserviceable for the next successes were not recorded until June 1942.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} Becker developed his own tactics for attacking a bomber. He stalked the aircraft from the stern, just below the height shown on the radar. After sighting the bomber, he dived and accelerated to avoid being spotted by the tail gunner. Once underneath the enemy, Becker reduced the throttle and matched the speed of the unsuspecting pilot. Becker then climbed steadily to 50 metres (164 metres) from below the target before he pulled up and opened fire. Because the Do 215 lost speed the bomber flew ahead and the through the stream of shells. With this method, the gun sight was rarely needed. These tactics were adopted by the night fighter force.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} The first Ju 88C fighters, equipped with radar were delivered to II./NJG 1 at [[Leeuwarden]] in February 1942. Only four sets arived and it took several weeks for them to become operational. The crews soon came to appreciate the device and were eager to secure it for their aircraft.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} Other platforms were tested in NJG 1 at this time. In March 1942 the [[Dornier Do 217]] J was also trialed in service with NJG 1; however the lack of performance made the type unpopular with crews.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=45\u201346}} \n\nIn February 1942, [[Air Marshall]] [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]] became [[Air Officer Commanding]] Bomber Command. Harris became the driving force behind producing a powerful [[heavy bomber]] command to carry out his [[area bombing]] operations. The attacks on [[Bombing of L\u00fcbeck in World War II|L\u00fcbeck in March]] and [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Cologne in May]] 1942 began the new phase in the [[Defence of the Reich]] campaign.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=41}} Over Lubeck, NJG 1 claimed only one bomber from seven claimed.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=42}} NJG 1 claimed 21 bombers during the latter attack on Cologne on 30/31 May 1942 from the 32 claimed by German night fighter units.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=42}} 41 bombers were lost.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=127}} Bomber Command began routine 1,000-bomber raids over Germany from 30 May to 17 August 1942 using the [[bomber stream]] to swap Kammhuber's defences. From August 1942, Bomber Command began introducing new navigation aids for its air fleets.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|pp=123\u2013178}} On 31 December 1942, Bomber Command utilised [[Pathfinder (RAF)|pathfinder]] [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s and Lancasters equipped with [[Oboe (navigation)|OBOE]] on a test raid to Dusseldorf.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=115}} Knacke made the last NJG 1 claim of the year against the latter type.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=63}} 1942 proved to be successful in a tactical sense for German night fighters. Lent led the claims for the year with 42, [[Reinhold Knacke]] claimed 40, as did Becker while Gildner claimed 38.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} On the night of the 16/17 September 1942 Knacke became the first night fighter to claim [[ace in a day]] status when he claimed five bombers.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=241}} In February 1943, one of the first major \"experts\", Becker was killed in action on a rare daylight interception against the [[United States Army Air Force]] (USAAF) [[Eighth Air Force]].{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=77}} Becker followed [[Helmut Woltersdorf]], killed in action in June 1942.{{sfn|Hinchliffe|1999|p=xi}}\n\n===Battle of the Ruhr,  Hamburg and Peenem\u00fcnde===\nIn March 1943, Harris began his first concerted [[military campaign]] against a specific objective, known as the [[Battle of the Ruhr]]. Harris had 53 squadrons for the battle, and his pathfinders were now operating the [[H2S (radar)|H2S ground-mapping radar]]. The Air Marshal felt he had sufficient resources for a long offensive against the German industrial region.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=69}} On 5 March 1943, Falck commanded the command ''staffel'' from Deelen, Streib commanded I ''Gruppe'' from Venlo, Thimmig commanded III ''Gruppe'' from [[Leeuwarden]] ,and Lent IV ''Gruppe'' from [[Twente]]; all operated the Bf 110. II ''Gruppe'' under Ehler at [[Sint-Truiden]] operated the Bf 110 and Do 217.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=69}}\n[[File:The German Air Force in the Second World War HU108216.jpg|thumb|left|Do 217J night fighter. A handful saw service with NJG 1]]\nOn the first night, 5/6 March 1943, NJG 1 claimed 10 bombers destroyed. Among the claimants were fighter pilots [[Manfred Meurer]], [[Herbert L\u00fctje]], [[Heinz Vinke]] and Lent all claimed. On 12/13 March NJG 1 claimed 13, and repeated this again on 29/30 March. On 3/4 April the wing claimed 17. The success was not repeated until 27/28 April when its pilots submitted 10 claims.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=70-73, 76-77}} On 4/5 May NJG 1 claimed 24 bombers destroyed and was the only Luftwaffe unit to report any successes that night. Among the pilots was [[Hans-Dieter Frank]] who would claim 55 aerial victories and briefly command I/NJG 1 before his death in a collision with a colleague while flying a [[Heinkel He 219]]. The collision may have been caused by an attack on his fighter by [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Bob Braham]].{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=76-77}} On 12/13 May the wing claimed 25, and on 13/14 May the pilots claimed another 26.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=79-80}} On 23/24 May a further 23 were claimed.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=81-83}} The attacks on Dortmund that night cost Bomber Command 38 aircraft.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=163}} Over the next six days 58 bombers were claimed by the night of the 30/31 May.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=81-83}} The operation against [[Wuppertal]] on 29/30 May cost the British 33 aircraft.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=163}}  211 RAF bombers were claimed by NJG 1 in June 1943.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=84-91}} Total British losses were 277 for the month to all causes.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=141}} The Nazi [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], wrote in his diary on 14 May 1943 of German defences; \"during the night there was another exceptionally heavy raid on [[Duisburg]]....An unspeakable sorrow and great distress has come to the sorely tired city. Our technical development as regards [[submarine]] missions and air warfare is far inferior to that of the [[English]] and [[American]]s. During the past five months the enemy has had the upper hand, almost everywhere he is defeating us in the air.\"{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=67}} \n\nBy the time the Ruhr campaign ended Bomber Command had suffered heavy losses to German night fighters and anti-aircraft defences. 1,099 were lost to all causes.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=141}} The Luftwaffe's defences were unable to prevent Bomber Command from severely disrupting German production. Steel production fell by 200,000 tons and the armaments industry was facing a steel shortfall of 400,000 tons.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=598}} After doubling production in 1942, production of steel increased only by 20 percent in 1943. [[Adolf Hitler]] and his armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] were forced to cut planned increases in production. This disruption caused the ''zulieferungskrise'' (sub-components crisis). The increase of aircraft production for the Luftwaffe also came to an abrupt halt. Monthly production failed to increase between July 1943 and March 1944. [[Adam Tooze]] concludes; \"Bomber Command had stopped Speer's armamanets miracle in its tracks.\"{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=598}} Production of [[locomotive]]s halted after March 1943 in the Ruhr along with ammunition fuses.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|pp=134\u2013135}} Over 100,000 people were [[dehoused]] in [[Essen]], contributing to the inability to continue production at the [[Krupp]] plant.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=135}}\n\nLuftwaffe night pilots experienced the presence of long-range RAF night fighting aircraft for the first time over Germany. Radar-installed [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s and [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s provided indirect [[fighter escort]] to Bomber Command over the Ruhr. These crews came from [[Fighter Command]], and termed their operations as \"flower\" [[sortie]]s. These tactics required RAF pilots to fly to known German night fighter airfields and patrol them in an effort to destroy the Luftwaffe interceptors as they got airborne or landed. These operations were successful and accounted for German aircraft losses in June.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|pp=90-94}} On 14 and 25 June 1943, NJG 1 lost one and two Bf 110s to RAF night fighters.{{sfn|Balss|1997|pp=157\u2013158}} In August 1943, Bomber Command's [[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation Hydra]] against [[Peenem\u00fcnde]]. Wing Commander Braham engaged two NJG 1 crews, the 15-victory ace Georg Kraft and another fighter ace [[Heinz Vinke]] and shot them both down, killing the former and wounding the latter.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=142}} Two other crews were lost on the operation.{{sfn|Middlebrook|2006|p=98}} A development of the raid was the recorded entry into II/NJG 1 war diary that it was to be converted to \"[[Wilde Sau|Wild Boar]]\" operations\u2014the use of radar-less [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] and [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] single-engine fighters piloted by experienced night flyers to attack bombers.{{sfn|Middlebrook|2006|pp=88-89}} [[Chief of the General Staff]], [[Hans Jeschonnek]] purportedly committed suicide because of the failure of night defences to repulse or prevent the attack.{{sfn|Middlebrook|2006|p=195}}\n\nOn 24 July 1943, days after the end of the Ruhr campaign, Harris ordered [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|\"Operation Gomorrah\"]], an attack on [[Hamburg]]. The objective was to disrupt or end [[U-boat]] production in the port city. The introduction of \"[[Chaff (countermeasure)|Window]]\" blew a hole in German radar coverage and the [[bomber stream]]s, aided by OBOE and H2S radar were able to penetrate the defences to devastate the centre of the city. The ''Himmelbett'' (canopy bed) system of radar-controlled night fighters slipping into the bomber stream and then using its own radar to pick out and engage individual bombers had gone. The effects of the raid, and the realisation German radar was temporarily blinded, led to the widespread use of the Wild Boar tactics over the summer, 1943.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=95}} 791 bombers hit the city. German air defences accounted for only 1.5 percent of the attacking force. The Nazi leadership was shaken, and Kammhuber, who resisted calls to abandon the advanced ''Himmelbett'' system, was compelled to find technical solutions to the jamming of Freya, Liechtenstein and W\u00fcrzburg radars. Kammhuber regarded the Wild Boar solution as an emergency measure only.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=94-96}} NJG 1 claimed only three from a total of 12 claimed by night fighter pilots in defence of the city\u2014[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 3]] claimed the rest. [[August Geiger (pilot)|August Geiger]] claimed two [Geiger became another notable victim of Braham in September 1943].{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=95-97}} In August the \"[[Zahme Sau|tame boar]]\" tactics were used to some effect. [[Viktor von Lo\u00dfberg]]'s idea was for night fighters equipped with experimental SN-2 radar to cooperate with Y-control systems and \"sluice\" them into the bomber stream. Once there, the night fighters were ordered to transmit direction-finding signals to attract other night fighters. While unguided, the radar operators and night fighter command retained some control over operations with success in August amounting to 250 aircraft claimed shot down on all fronts. The success was offset by losses of 40 killed in the night fighter arm, with only 28 replacements in August. 61 twin-engine night fighters were lost, but only 59 were replaced.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=101\u2013104, 106}}\n\nOn 5 October 1943 NJG 1 with NJG 2 formed the [[1st Fighter Division (Germany)|1.

Jamestown was founded in 1872.\n\n==History==\nIn 1871, a [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] work crew set up camp where the railroad would cross the James River, adding another section to the new northern transcontinental line.  In 1872, the U.S. Army established Fort Seward, a small post garrisoned by three companies (about 120 men) of the Twentieth Infantry Regiment, on a bluff overlooking the confluence of the [[James River (Dakotas)|James River]] and [[Pipestem River|Pipestem Creek]]. The fort guarded the crossing of the James by the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]]. The fort only lasted five years, being decommissioned in 1877 - but the railroad remained, establishing a repair yard that was among the city's main industries until the 1960s.\n\nJamestown was founded in 1872 and General Thomas Rosser of Northern Pacific named it after [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. The city incorporated in 1883.  In 1873, Stutsman County became the first official county within Dakota Territory with Jamestown as the county seat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liechtyrealestate.com/Jamestown/JamestownHistory/ |title=Jamestown History |publisher=Liechtyrealestate.com |accessdate=2013-02-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120908114440/http://www.liechtyrealestate.com/Jamestown/JamestownHistory/ |archivedate=September 8, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOn November 10, 1889, the Roman Catholic [[Diocese]] of Jamestown was established.

On Sept. 22, 1909 Jamestown College reopened after a population growth in the State due to improved farming methods. With no higher education available between Fargo, ND (100 miles East) and Missoula, MT (700 miles West), Jamestown College became a successful school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uj.edu/about-us/our-history |title=Our History |accessdate=2015-05-01 |date=2015 |work=University of Jamestown}}</ref>\n\n===Special education===\nOn the northwest side of the city and almost adjacent to the site of historic Fort Seward is [[The Anne Carlsen Center]] (formerly known as the \"Crippled Children's School\").

In 1872, the U.S. Army established Fort Seward, a small post garrisoned by three companies (about 120 men) of the Twentieth Infantry Regiment, on a bluff overlooking the confluence of the [[James River (Dakotas)|James River]] and [[Pipestem River|Pipestem Creek]]. The fort guarded the crossing of the James by the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]]. The fort only lasted five years, being decommissioned in 1877 - but the railroad remained, establishing a repair yard that was among the city's main industries until the 1960s.\n\nJamestown was founded in 1872 and General Thomas Rosser of Northern Pacific named it after [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. The city incorporated in 1883.  In 1873, Stutsman County became the first official county within Dakota Territory with Jamestown as the county seat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liechtyrealestate.com/Jamestown/JamestownHistory/ |title=Jamestown History |publisher=Liechtyrealestate.com |accessdate=2013-02-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120908114440/http://www.liechtyrealestate.com/Jamestown/JamestownHistory/ |archivedate=September 8, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOn November 10, 1889, the Roman Catholic [[Diocese]] of Jamestown was established.

It was re-released in 2001 as ''Twisted Tenderness::Deluxe'' by Koch with a second disc of [[B-side]]s and [[remix]]es added.\n\n==History==\nThe writing and recording of the album was a reaction to the protracted sessions of its predecessor ''[[Raise the Pressure]]'',<ref name=\"Twisted Tenderness\">''[[City Life (magazine)|City Life]]'', 31 March 1999</ref> which had taken a year and a half to complete. Marr and Sumner remained the only official members of the band, but were joined by [[Doves (band)|Doves]] frontman [[Jimi Goodwin]] on bass and [[Black Grape]] drummer [[Ged Lynch]].
