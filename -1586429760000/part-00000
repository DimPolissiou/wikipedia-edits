It is located 2 hours by road from the nearest major town, [[San Marcos, Guatemala|San Marcos]]/[[San Pedro Sacatep\u00e9quez, San Marcos|San Pedro Sacatep\u00e9quez]], and is between 8\u201310 hours from [[Guatemala City]], which is 325&nbsp;km (200 miles) to the east. As of 2008 the municipality had a population of 18,000 inhabitants, 3,930 of which lived in the town center.<ref name=ine>{{cite web|author=SEGEPLAN|title=Demograf\u00eda de San Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam, San Marcos|url=http://sistemas.segeplan.gob.gt/sideplanw/SDPPGDM$PRINCIPAL.VISUALIZAR?pID=POBLACION_PDF_1224|year=2010|accessdate=10 July 2015|website=SEGEPLAN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710202603/http://sistemas.segeplan.gob.gt/sideplanw/SDPPGDM$PRINCIPAL.VISUALIZAR?pID=POBLACION_PDF_1224|archivedate=10 July 2015|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}</ref> Politically, it is divided into 6 different micro-regions, which are composed of 68 different communities of varying size. The town centre is located at the altitude of 3,050 metres (10,000 feet) above sea level, which makes the average temperature 16\u00b0 Celsius (61\u00b0 Fahrenheit), quite cold for tropical standards. However, due to extreme variety of elevations within the municipality there are some very temperate communities in lower elevations, and very frigid communities at higher elevations. In January 2008, for the first time in recent history, snow fell on the Cotzic pass, which is the highest point in the entire municipality (3,700 metres/12,000&nbsp;ft. above sea level)\n\nDuring the rainy season (mid-May to mid-November) the town is regularly subjected to white-out conditions and constant drizzle because of cloud accumulation. Despite the inclement weather, the town offers many great vistas and hiking opportunities, especially during the dry season. San Jos\u00e9 is perched above several river valleys, as the Coatan and Cuilco rivers both have major tributaries born in San Jos\u00e9. And on a clear day it is possible to view as far as Volcano Agua to the east, the Cumbre plateau in Huehuetenango to the northeast, and the Mexican/Guatemalan Coast and Tapachula to the southwest. The two tallest points in Central America, Volcano Tajumulco and Volcano Tacan\u00e1 are also both very close and are regularly visible from San Jos\u00e9. Additionally, San Jos\u00e9 is the home of \"El Prado\", a trout hatchery, which is a short walk away from the town centre.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sancir|first=Noli|url=http://sanjoseojetenamepscomunicacion.blogspot.com/|title=San Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam, EPS|accessdate=10 July 2015|date=n.d.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710203552/http://sanjoseojetenamepscomunicacion.blogspot.com/|archivedate=10 July 2015|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}</ref> El Prado has a hotel, a conference center, a playground, and visitors can fish in the pond and take small pedal boats onto the water as well.\n\nIn regards to the population, there is a pocket of [[Ladino people|Ladino]] (people who belong to the Hispanic culture, and speak [[Guatemalan Spanish|Spanish]]) Guatemalans who live in the town center, and there are a few communities on the fringe of the municipality that speak in [[Mam language|Mam]], a [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]], and dress in traditional indigenous clothing, but the majority of the inhabitants of San Jos\u00e9 fall into a gray area. Ethnically, they fall into the indigenous category, as their ancestors were indigenous. However, culturally and legally, they self-identify as Ladinos, as this is a social advantage in society. The change of identity originated in the [[Guatemalan Civil War]], when indigenous peoples in the highlands were military targets. Many indigenous people, in San Jos\u00e9 as well as other places, started dressing more like Ladinos and started speaking solely in Spanish to avoid scrutiny from the army. This change became permanent in San Jos\u00e9, and today the only language spoken is Spanish, with the exception of the very few outlying communities who still speak Mam.\n\n== Economy ==\n\nOjetecos, as San Jos\u00e9 residents are known, are mostly subsistence farmers. Their main agricultural products include potatoes, wheat, oats, beans, [[maize]], squash, avocados, peaches, and apples to name a few. These crops are also traded and sold during bi-weekly market days. The majority of income however, does not come from the agricultural sector, but rather from remittances. Most San Jos\u00e9 families have one or more member working illegally in the United States, sending back money weekly or monthly. The poorest families, those that cannot afford to pay for passage to the United States, usually send a male representative across the border to Chiapas, Mexico once a year, where they can find work picking coffee. These family members also remit their money, making the economy of San Jos\u00e9 wholly dependent on remittances.\n\n== History ==\nThe municipality was settled by a group of people on 23 August 1848 as \"San Jos\u00e9\", where in the 21st century there is a small settlement,<ref name=guatelog>{{cite web|url=http://www.guatelog.com/log/359/San-Jose-Ojetenam-San-Marcos.html|website=Guatelog|title=San Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam, San Marcos|location=Guatemala|accessdate=15 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505094908/http://www.guatelog.com/log/359/San-Jose-Ojetenam-San-Marcos.html|archivedate=5 May 2015|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}</ref> by an initiative of \u00c1ngel Roblero.<ref name=guatelog/>{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The municipality founding fathers were: \u00c1ngel Roblero, Br\u00edgido Roblero, Jos\u00e9 Roblero, Marcos G\u00f3mez, Leonidas Escobar, Antonio de Le\u00f3n, Luis Barrios, Carlos de Le\u00f3n, Francisco de Le\u00f3n, Benigno Roblero, Narciso Roblero, Domingo Roblero and Ursulo Romero.<ref name=guatelog/>}}\n\nAfter severe landslides forced the inhabitants to move to a different location, they chose a place called \u00abIxjoyon\u00bb ([[mam language]] meaning \u00abland prosperous for potato\u00bb), where the main settlement has remained since. During the 1871 revolution, general [[Justo Rufino Barrios]] conferenced with his troops prior to invade [[Tacan\u00e1]] in a hill that surrounds this area, which has been called \"Cerro Barrios\" (\"Barrios hill\") since.<ref name=guatelog/>\n\nIn 1935, during general [[Jorge Ubico]]'s regime, the municipality was dissolved and the settlements was annexed to [[Ixchigu\u00e1n]]. However, this change was short-lived, as once Ubico was overthrown in 1945, new president el doctor [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo]], On 21 June 1945 designated it as a municipality once again.<ref name=guatelog/><ref>{{cite web|author=SEGEPLAN|url=http://snip.segeplan.gob.gt/guest/SNPCPT$IMAGENES?pID=F702555700/P-110%20SAN%20JOSE%20OJETENAM.pdf&pTIPO=D|title=Municipalidad de San Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam|location=Guatemala|accessdate=15 February 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nA variety of non-governmental organizations operate in San Jose to assist its people in agricultural projects, forestry projects, small business development, childhood education, and municipal development. Examples of these organizations include: The United States Peace Corps, [[Intervida]], CARE International, and Creciendo Bien. During 2003, the [[Cuban government]] deployed two nurses to assist the Guatemalan doctor and two Guatemalan nurses already staffing the municipal clinic. In July 2005, the medical resources of that clinic were overwhelmed when an overloaded bus on the way to market veered off the road and tumbled 200 metres down the hillside. The bus was carrying more than 90 people. More than 30 people died in the accident. 50 more were injured. San Jose's ambulance was not working at the time because it had broken down after being repeatedly used to transport the town's soccer team to and from regional games.\n\n==Climate==\n\nSan Jos\u00e9

It is located 2 hours by road from the nearest major town, [[San Marcos, Guatemala|San Marcos]]/[[San Pedro Sacatep\u00e9quez, San Marcos|San Pedro Sacatep\u00e9quez]], and is between 8\u201310 hours from [[Guatemala City]], which is 325&nbsp;km (200 miles) to the east.  As of 2008 the municipality had a population of 18,000 inhabitants, 3,930 of which lived in the town center.<ref name=ine>{{cite web|author=SEGEPLAN|title=Demograf\u00eda de San Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam, San Marcos|url=http://sistemas.segeplan.gob.gt/sideplanw/SDPPGDM$PRINCIPAL.VISUALIZAR?pID=POBLACION_PDF_1224|year=2010|accessdate=10 July 2015|website=SEGEPLAN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710202603/http://sistemas.segeplan.gob.gt/sideplanw/SDPPGDM$PRINCIPAL.VISUALIZAR?pID=POBLACION_PDF_1224|archivedate=10 July 2015|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}</ref>  Politically, it is divided into 6 different micro-regions, which are composed of 68 different communities of varying size. The town centre is located at the altitude of 3,050 metres (10,000 feet) above sea level, which makes the average temperature 16\u00b0 Celsius (61\u00b0 Fahrenheit), quite cold for tropical standards.  However, due to extreme variety of elevations within the municipality there are some very temperate communities in lower elevations, and very frigid communities at higher elevations.  In January 2008, for the first time in recent history, snow fell on the Cotzic pass, which is the highest point in the entire municipality (3,700 metres/12,000&nbsp;ft. above sea level)\n\nDuring the rainy season (mid-May to mid-November) the town is regularly subjected to white-out conditions and constant drizzle because of cloud accumulation.  Despite the inclement weather, the town offers many great vistas and hiking opportunities, especially during the dry season.  San Jos\u00e9 is perched above several river valleys, as the Coatan and Cuilco rivers both have major tributaries born in San Jos\u00e9. And on a clear day it is possible to view as far as Volcano Agua to the east, the Cumbre plateau in Huehuetenango to the northeast, and the Mexican/Guatemalan Coast and Tapachula to the southwest. The two tallest points in Central America, Volcano Tajumulco and Volcano Tacan\u00e1 are also both very close and are regularly visible from San Jos\u00e9.  Additionally, San Jos\u00e9 is the home of \"El Prado\", a trout hatchery, which is a short walk away from the town centre.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sancir|first=Noli|url=http://sanjoseojetenamepscomunicacion.blogspot.com/|title=San Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam, EPS|accessdate=10 July 2015|date=n.d.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710203552/http://sanjoseojetenamepscomunicacion.blogspot.com/|archivedate=10 July 2015|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}</ref>  El Prado has a hotel, a conference center, a playground, and visitors can fish in the pond and take small pedal boats onto the water as well.\n\nIn regards to the population,  there is a pocket of [[Ladino people|Ladino]] (people who belong to the Hispanic culture, and speak [[Guatemalan Spanish|Spanish]]) Guatemalans who live in the town center, and there are a few communities on the fringe of the municipality that speak in [[Mam language|Mam]], a [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]], and dress in traditional indigenous clothing, but the majority of the inhabitants of San Jos\u00e9 fall into a gray area.  Ethnically, they fall into the indigenous category, as their ancestors were indigenous.  However, culturally and legally, they self-identify as Ladinos, as this is a social advantage in society.  The change of identity originated in the [[Guatemalan Civil War]], when indigenous peoples in the highlands were military targets.  Many indigenous people, in San Jos\u00e9 as well as other places, started dressing more like Ladinos and started speaking solely in Spanish to avoid scrutiny from the army.  This change became permanent in San Jos\u00e9, and today the only language spoken is Spanish, with the exception of the very few outlying communities who still speak Mam.\n\n== Economy ==\n\nOjetecos, as San Jos\u00e9 residents are known, are mostly subsistence farmers.  Their main agricultural products include potatoes, wheat, oats, beans, [[maize]], squash, avocados, peaches, and apples to name a few.  These crops are also traded and sold during bi-weekly market days.  The majority of income however, does not come from the agricultural sector, but rather from remittances.  Most San Jos\u00e9 families have one or more member working illegally in the United States, sending back money weekly or monthly.  The poorest families, those that cannot afford to pay for passage to the United States, usually send a male representative across the border to Chiapas, Mexico once a year, where they can find work picking coffee.  These family members also remit their money, making the economy of San Jos\u00e9 wholly dependent on remittances.\n\n== History  ==\nThe municipality was settled by a group of people on 23 August 1848 as \"San Jos\u00e9\", where in the 21st century there is a small settlement,<ref name=guatelog>{{cite web|url=http://www.guatelog.com/log/359/San-Jose-Ojetenam-San-Marcos.html|website=Guatelog|title=San Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam, San Marcos|location=Guatemala|accessdate=15 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505094908/http://www.guatelog.com/log/359/San-Jose-Ojetenam-San-Marcos.html|archivedate=5 May 2015|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}</ref> by an initiative of \u00c1ngel Roblero.<ref name=guatelog/>{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The municipality founding fathers were: \u00c1ngel Roblero, Br\u00edgido Roblero, Jos\u00e9 Roblero, Marcos G\u00f3mez, Leonidas Escobar, Antonio de Le\u00f3n, Luis Barrios, Carlos de Le\u00f3n, Francisco de Le\u00f3n, Benigno Roblero, Narciso Roblero, Domingo Roblero and Ursulo Romero.<ref name=guatelog/>}}\n\nAfter severe landslides forced the inhabitants to move to a different location, they chose a place called \u00abIxjoyon\u00bb ([[mam language]] meaning \u00abland prosperous for potato\u00bb), where the main settlement has remained since.  During the 1871 revolution, general [[Justo Rufino Barrios]] conferenced with his troops prior to invade [[Tacan\u00e1]] in a hill that surrounds this area, which has been called \"Cerro Barrios\" (\"Barrios hill\") since.<ref name=guatelog/>\n\nIn 1935, during general [[Jorge Ubico]]'s regime, the municipality was dissolved and the settlements was annexed to [[Ixchigu\u00e1n]]. However, this change was short-lived, as once Ubico was overthrown in 1945, new president el doctor [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo]], On 21 June 1945 designated it as a municipality once again.<ref name=guatelog/><ref>{{cite web|author=SEGEPLAN|url=http://snip.segeplan.gob.gt/guest/SNPCPT$IMAGENES?pID=F702555700/P-110%20SAN%20JOSE%20OJETENAM.pdf&pTIPO=D|title=Municipalidad de San Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam|location=Guatemala|accessdate=15 February 2014|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nA variety of non-governmental organizations operate in San Jose to assist its people in agricultural projects, forestry projects, small business development, childhood education, and municipal development.  Examples of these organizations include: The United States Peace Corps, [[Intervida]], CARE International, and Creciendo Bien.  During 2003, the [[Cuban government]] deployed two nurses to assist the Guatemalan doctor and two Guatemalan nurses already staffing the municipal clinic. In July 2005, the medical resources of that clinic were overwhelmed when an overloaded bus on the way to market veered off the road and tumbled 200 metres down the hillside.  The bus was carrying more than 90 people.  More than 30 people died in the accident.  50 more were injured.  San Jose's ambulance was not working at the time because it had broken down after being repeatedly used to transport the town's soccer team to and from regional games.\n\n==Climate==\n\nSan Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam has [[temperate climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cwb'').\n\n{{Weather box\n|width=auto\n|location = San Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan mean C = 7.7\n|Feb mean C = 7.7\n|Mar mean C = 9.2\n|Apr mean C = 9.9\n|May mean C = 10.5\n|Jun mean C = 10.4\n|Jul mean C = 10.3\n|Aug mean C = 10.0\n|Sep mean C = 10.3\n|Oct mean C = 9.6\n|Nov mean C = 9.0\n|Dec mean C = 8.7\n|year mean C = \n|Jan high C = 14.8\n|Feb high C = 14.9\n|Mar high C = 16.5\n|Apr high C = 16.8\n|May high C = 16.0\n|Jun high C = 15.1\n|Jul high C = 15.0\n|Aug high C = 15.3\n|Sep high C = 14.9\n|Oct high C = 14.4\n|Nov high C = 14.9\n|Dec high C = 15.1\n|year high C =\n|Jan low C = 0.7\n|Feb low C = 0.6\n|Mar low C = 1.9\n|Apr low C = 3.1\n|May low C = 5.0\n|Jun low C = 5.8\n|Jul low C = 5.6\n|Aug low C = 4.8\n|Sep low C = 5.7\n|Oct low C = 4.9\n|Nov low C = 3.1\n|Dec low C = 2.3\n|year low C =\n|Jan precipitation mm = 14\n|Feb precipitation mm = 11\n|Mar precipitation mm = 26\n|Apr precipitation mm = 70\n|May precipitation mm = 180\n|Jun precipitation mm = 274\n|Jul precipitation mm = 197\n|Aug precipitation mm = 227\n|Sep precipitation mm = 291\n|Oct precipitation mm = 183\n|Nov precipitation mm = 41\n|Dec precipitation mm = 18\n|year precipitation mm =\n|source 1 = Climate-Data.org<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\">\n{{cite web|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/46109/\n|title= Climate: San Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam\n|accessdate= 5 September 2015\n|website= Climate-Data.org}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Geographic location ==\nSan Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam is 60&nbsp;km away from [[San Marcos, Guatemala|San Marcos]], the capital of the Department of San Marcos.\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Center=San Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam\n|North=[[Tectit\u00e1n]], municipality of [[Huehuetenango Department]]\n|East=[[Tacan\u00e1]], municipality of [[San Marcos Department]]<ref name=segeplan>{{cite web|author=SEGEPLAN|title=municipalitys del departamento de San Marcos|url=http://www.segeplan.gob.gt/2.0/index.php?option=com_k2&view=itemlist&task=category&id=274:san-jose-ojetenam|year=s.f.|accessdate=10 July 2015|website=Secretar\u00eda General de Planificaci\u00f3n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710201808/http://www.segeplan.gob.gt/2.0/index.php?option=com_k2&view=itemlist&task=category&id=274:san-jose-ojetenam|archivedate=10 July 2015|language=Spanish|ref=harv}}</ref>\n|West=[[Concepci\u00f3n Tutuapa]] and [[Tejutla, San Marcos]], municipalities of San Marcos Department\n|South=[[Ixchigu\u00e1n]], municipality of San Marcos Department.<ref name=segeplan/>\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|Guatemala}}\n* {{Portal-inline|Geography}}\n* [[San Marcos, Guatemala|San Marcos]]\n\n==Notes and references ==\n\n===Notes ===\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150710203552/http://sanjoseojetenamepscomunicacion.blogspot.com/ San Jos\u00e9 Ojetenam images]\n*[http://www.inforpressca.com/sanjoseojetenam/ Official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070720090556/http://www.visitguatemala.com/nuevo/destinos_municipio.asp?id=230 Some information in Spanish]\n\n{{San Marcos Department}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:San Jose Ojetenam}}\n[[Category:Municipalities of the San Marcos Department]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Guatemala]]\n", "name_user": "Quebec99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix duplicate ref names \u2013You can help!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jos%C3%A9_Ojetenam"}

It consisted of a concurrently geared (as opposed to sequentially geared) planetary gearbox with a 'switch pitch' dual-pitch torque converter stator. Turboglide utilized a die-cast aluminum transmission case, following [[Packard]]'s [[Ultramatic]] of 1956. It was designed to help showcase the engineering features of the '[[57 Chevy]], and was often ordered with the [[Rochester Ramjet]] [[Fuel Injection]] system on the [[Chevrolet small-block engine|283 V8]]. Turboglide cost about $50 more than [[Powerglide]], and was available in all 1957-1961 V8 engine models except the [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]].\n\n==Concept==\n[[Chevrolet]] Turboglide was modeled along the lines of the Buick Flight Pitch [[Dynaflow]] transmission, and operated very similarly to the [[Buick]] transmission. Using a five element [[torque converter]], (pump, individual turbines for low, intermediate and direct ranges, and a [[switch pitch]] [[stator]]) the Turboglide offered the smoothest operation of any automatic in the industry, as no 'shift' occurred between ranges and hence there was no potential to create a disruption in the perfectly smooth flow of power. Concurrently spinning turbines, each of which was geared for the same torque multiplication as a different gear in a 3 speed unit, overlapped in effectively varying total power multiplication on a continuous basis. For extra 'getaway' power at any road speed, the converter stator vanes could be directed to a steeper angle which raised the stall speed of the torque converter and increased torque multiplication, as well as directing the oil flow at the turbine for the next lowest range.

Some owners of the early 1957 models with the Turboglide transmission marked with '''HR''' [Hill Retarder] mistook the '''HR''' to mean High Range so the marking was changed early in the model year to '''Gr''' [Grade Retarder].\n\n==Operation==\n{{originalresearch|section|date=March 2015}}\n{{unreferencedsection|date=March 2015}}\nThe basis of Turboglide's unique abilities was its five-element [[torque converter]]. Most automatic transmissions have a three-element torque converter, consisting of an impeller, which is an engine-driven pump, a turbine that rotates with the [[flywheel]] \u2013 a transmission-driven turbine that receives the energy of the oil propelled by the impeller \u2013 and a stator that redirects the recirculating oil so that it strikes the back side of impeller blades in order to assist the engine rotation and to recapture energy from the fast moving oil. The stator is what gives to the torque converter its torque multiplication ability \u2014 in effect, allowing it to reduce the ratio for increasing the torque when the turbine is rotating slower than the pump.\n\nIn most automatic transmissions, the drive turbine only functions as an input to the transmission where the power is redirected to gears in its automatic gearbox. Turboglide differs by using ''three'' individual drive turbines, each connected to a different ratio inside the gearbox. Oil leaving the pump first strikes the turbine connected to the Low (first gear) ratio. The design of the turbine permits oil to pass through its blades and strike the next turbine in line, the one connected to the Intermediate ratio, which receives some of the energy remaining in the oil flow. After leaving the intermediate turbine, the oil is passed to the direct turbine which is direct drive at [[drive shaft]] speed. As the car starts from rest, the low turbine, which has the greatest gear reduction ratio is relatively easy to bring up to match pump (engine) speed and the car starts from rest easily and accelerates quickly. While this occurs, the intermediate turbine receives an ever increasing share of the energy from the pump, as the Low turbine moves faster and oil passes more freely through it. Eventually, the low turbine matches pump speed, and the low turbine freewheels on a one-way [[sprag clutch]] much like on a bicycle. At this point, the intermediate turbine is carrying the majority of the drive force, and some energy is being sent to the direct turbine from the oil passing through the intermediate turbine as it also begins to match pump speed. Eventually, the intermediate turbine also matches pump speed, and the oil passes freely through low and intermediate turbines to drive the direct turbine alone, in direct drive (1:1 ratio). Because of the overlapping power input in different ratios, there is no 'shift' or sequential gearing, rather there is a concurrent geared drive, in effect the car starts out in 1-2-3, eventually drops 1 to be in 2-3 and eventually drops 2 to be in 3 alone.\n\nThe stator element of the torque converter has two blade positions, controlled by the driver via the accelerator pedal to offer a 'passing gear' and extra response at any speed from heavy throttle application. In normal driving the stator blades are arranged at 'cruise' angle which offers improved efficiency and response at light throttle. Flooring the accelerator pedal changes the angle of the stator vanes hydraulically to 'performance angle' which permits the converter to achieve stall about 1000&nbsp;rpm higher than in 'cruise' as well as redirecting oil to strike the next-lowest drive turbine which effectively lowers the drive ratio of the transmission and allows engine speed to flare to a speed where output is greatest.\n\nBecause of its unique operating characteristics, Turboglide did not require large changes in engine RPM even with very large differences in car speed or desired engine output. In fact, accelerating from rest, the engine speed would remain nearly constant (with no movement of the accelerator), even as the vehicle accelerated. The actual RPM would be a function of the pressure applied to the accelerator. One interesting effect during acceleration was the \"audio\" transition from the first gear turbine (occurring about 2 seconds after takeoff with moderate throttle), then progressing through the remaining 2 turbines which were not so audible (A similar audio effect occurs with a stepped 3-speed automatic... with the first gear having a characteristic whine).\nAt full throttle, Turboglide will maintain the engine RPM within a narrow (~400&nbsp;rpm) span of speed around 3500-4000&nbsp;rpm where the best engine output is maintained, and the car will accelerate with a strong \"slingshot effect\" to catch up as the ratios drop imperceptibly as the car speed increases along the road. The effect is very similar to that of a jet aircraft during the take-off phase, since the engine maintains a strong high speed and the car accelerates, smoothly and strongly, from rest to maximum. In the normal light traffic driving, the Turboglide automatically selects the highest (namely the lowest numerically) practical ratio and the engine speeds run in the 1000-2500&nbsp;rpm range, saving fuel and improving the throttle response of the car to the small pedal motions. Turboglide also offered a 'Grade Retarder' range for providing engine braking when necessary, a driving condition which could absorb close to {{convert|200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} of power above to what was available via the engine compression, by counter-rotating the turbines in the converter and soaking up the vehicle energy by agitating the oil inside the converter housing. No low range was provided with Turboglide, as in the Drive range the ratio was always automatically and perfectly matched to the requirements of the operator (all ranges being always engaged, low and intermediate would freewheel on the '[[sprag|sprag-clutch]]es' as needed), and with the [[Grade Retarder]] providing a very efficient [[engine brake]].\n\nAccording to the Chevrolet manual, above 65mph at wide open throttle, the torque converter began to act as a [[hydraulic coupling]], once the third turbine became fully engaged and no multiplication of torque occurred, as it would at lower speeds. So, for all practical purposes, at speeds higher than 65mph, the Turboglide acted as if engaged in top gear, while below that speed, torque multiplication changed imperceptibly, save for mechanical noise and acceleration.\n\n[[Continuously Variable Transmission]]s (CVT), which are available in some smaller cars, offer similar performance \u2013 albeit completely mechanical; while the Turboglide operates hydraulically and may be geared to multiply torque at any speed.\n\n==History==\nTurboglide was designed under the supervision of [[Frank Winchell]], [[Ed Cole]] and [[Robert P Benzinger]] at Chevrolet engineering. Although Turboglide offered remarkable performance and smoothness, the execution of the first 1957 units led to substantial customer complaints and the unit was continuously upgraded to improve its durability until it was discontinued in 1961. The 1959 Turboglide incorporated very significant changes intended to improve its durability, some of which were possible to retrofit to earlier versions.  Some enthusiasts reported that Turboglide had better reliability when coupled with the smaller 283 cubic-inch [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Turbo-Fire]] V8, than with the big-block 348 [[Chevrolet_Big-Block_engine#Generation_1:_W-series|Turbo-Thrust]] engine.\nThe Turboglide was GMs first attempt at a mass-produced aluminum case transmission. Because of this innovative technology of the times, there were many complaints of the aluminum case cracking from the transmission operating pressures. This is why customers of those vehicles called it the \"Terribleglide\" transmission. GM continued to improve this and other areas of the transmission however by 1961 most potential customers had enough and the Turboglide faded out of existence.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*[http://chevy.oldcarmanualproject.com/trans/60tg/5860ttco01.htm 1958 - 1960 Chevrolet Turboglide Transmission Construction and Operation]\n\n[[Category:Automotive transmission technologies]]\n[[Category:Automatic transmission tradenames]]\n[[Category:General Motors transmissions]]\n", "text_old": "The '''Turboglide''' is a [[Chevrolet]] constant torque, continuously variable [[automatic transmission]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Flory, Jr.|first=J. \"Kelly\"|title=American Cars, 1946-1959 Every Model Every Year|year=2008|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|isbn=978-0-7864-3229-5}}</ref> that made its debut as an optional transmission on Chevrolet [[Chevrolet small-block engine|V8]] passenger cars for 1957. It consisted of a concurrently geared (as opposed to sequentially geared) planetary gearbox with a 'switch pitch' dual-pitch torque converter stator. Turboglide utilized a die-cast aluminum transmission case, following [[Packard]]'s [[Ultramatic]] of 1956. It was designed to help showcase the engineering features of the '[[57 Chevy]], and was often ordered with the [[Rochester Ramjet]] [[Fuel Injection]] system on the [[Chevrolet small-block engine|283 V8]]. Turboglide cost about $50 more than [[Powerglide]], and was available in all 1957-1961 V8 engine models except the [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]].\n\n==Concept==\n[[Chevrolet]] Turboglide was modeled along the lines of the Buick Flight Pitch [[Dynaflow]] transmission, and operated very similarly to the [[Buick]] transmission. Using a five element [[torque converter]], (pump, individual turbines for low, intermediate and direct ranges, and a [[switch pitch]] [[stator]]) the Turboglide offered the smoothest operation of any automatic in the industry, as no 'shift' occurred between ranges and hence there was no potential to create a disruption in the perfectly smooth flow of power. Concurrently spinning turbines, each of which was geared for the same torque multiplication as a different gear in a 3 speed unit, overlapped in effectively varying total power multiplication on a continuous basis. For extra 'getaway' power at any road speed, the converter stator vanes could be directed to a steeper angle which raised the stall speed of the torque converter and increased torque multiplication, as well as directing the oil flow at the turbine for the next lowest range.

Its replacement in 1579 was destroyed by raiders. The present church was built in 1675.<ref>\"Hindu temples and deities\" by Rui Gomes Pereira</ref><ref>\"Gomantak Prakruti ani Sanskruti\" by B.D.Satoskar</ref>\n\n===Damodar Temple===\n\nThe initial settlement of Marg\u00e3o grew from the site of the ancient Damodar Temple. The original temple was demolished and the temple [[Irrigation tank|tank]] was filled up to be replaced by the Holy Spirit church and church grounds{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}. The deity [[Damodar (name of Krishna)|Damodar]] (a form of Lord Vishnu) was carried across the [[Zuari]] Agranashini river to the Novas Conquistas in which the Sonde rulers resided.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} While the western side of the Holy Spirit Church developed as a market place, the settlement grew on the eastern side, that is, the Borda region, with the Holy Spirit Church, Margao at its core and extended outwards.\n\n===Camara Municipal de Salcete===\nThe Municipality during the erstwhile Portuguese regime was known as \"C\u00e2mara Municipal de Salcete\",<ref name=\" Camara Municipal de Salcete\">[http://www.mmcmargao.gov.in/aboutUs.aspx]</ref> catering to all the villages in Salcete Taluka for over 300 years until the Goa Municipalities Act of 1968 came into force. The C\u00e2mara Municipal de Salcete is now reconstituted into Margao Municipal Council. The Members of the C\u00e2mara Municipal de Salcete were then nominated by the Government, but after the reconstitution of the Municipal Council, the Members to all the 20 wards (10 in Margao & 10 in Fatorda) are elected by the Members of the council.\n\n===The Holy Spirit Church===\n\nThe Largo de Igreja, or the Church of the Holy Spirit, was built by the Portuguese in 1675 and boasts a pristine white fa\u00e7ade and an interior dripping with gilt crystal and stucco. The Municipal Garden square is defined on one side by the church with its baroque architecture and the parochial house, and on the other side by the palatial mansions of affluent elite Catholics, positioned in a row. The ''Associa\u00e7\u00e3o das Communidades'' (Communities Association) building and the school being the odd exceptions which add to its character and sense of scale. They have a maximum height of two stories, and ''balc\u00f5es'' [[balcony|balconies]] and ''varandas'' ([[veranda]]s) facing the square. Parallel to the church square is the commercial street (old market). There is also a landscaped area next to the church called ''Pra\u00e7a da Alegria'' (Joy Square). The church feast is celebrated before the monsoons, it is a time when many residents make pre-monsoon purchases to stock up for a prolonged rainy season.\n\nMarg\u00e3o's importance as an administrative and commercial area grew with the increasing dependence of the surrounding towns and villages; leading to the administrative center with the town hall at its center being built in the south.\n\nIn 1961, Goa was freed from [[Portugal|Portuguese]] occupation and incorporated into the [[Indian Union]], and Marg\u00e3o was declared as the administrative center of the district of [[South Goa]].\n\n==Geography==\nMargao is located at {{Coord|15|16|25|N|73|57|29|E}}.

It is derived from the [[Sanskrit]]  {{lang|sa|\u092e\u0920\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e}} (''Ma\u1e6dhagr\u0101ma'') which means a village of monasteries.\n\nIn ''Ravanphond'', now a suburb of Margao, there are shrines of [[Matsyendranath]] and [[Gorakhnath]].<ref name=\"satos\">{{cite book|last1=Satoskar|first1=B.D|title=Gomantak: prak\u1e5bit\u012b \u0101\u1e47i sa\u1e43sk\u1e5bit\u012b|date=1979|publisher=\u015aubhd\u0101-S\u0101rasvat|page=113}}</ref> The abode of [[Nath]] medicants was called a ''Matha'' (Monastery).

Its replacement in 1579 was destroyed by raiders. The present church was built in 1675.<ref>\"Hindu temples and deities\" by Rui Gomes Pereira</ref><ref>\"Gomantak Prakruti ani Sanskruti\" by B.D.Satoskar</ref>\n\n===Damodar Temple===\n\nThe initial settlement of Marg\u00e3o grew from the site of the ancient Damodar Temple. The original temple was demolished and the temple [[Irrigation tank|tank]] was filled up to be replaced by the Holy Spirit church and church grounds{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}. The deity [[Damodar (name of Krishna)|Damodar]] (a form of Lord Vishnu) was carried across the [[Zuari]] Agranashini river to the Novas Conquistas in which the Sonde rulers resided.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} While the western side of the Holy Spirit Church developed as a market place, the settlement grew on the eastern side, that is, the Borda region, with the Holy Spirit Church, Margao at its core and extended outwards.\n\n===Camara Municipal de Salcete===\nThe Municipality during the erstwhile Portuguese regime was known as \"C\u00e2mara Municipal de Salcete\",<ref name=\" Camara Municipal de Salcete\">[http://www.mmcmargao.gov.in/aboutUs.aspx]</ref> catering to all the villages in Salcete Taluka for over 300 years until the Goa Municipalities Act of 1968 came into force. The C\u00e2mara Municipal de Salcete is now reconstituted into Margao Municipal Council. The Members of the C\u00e2mara Municipal de Salcete were then nominated by the Government, but after the reconstitution of the Municipal Council, the Members to all the 20 wards (10 in Margao & 10 in Fatorda) are elected by the Members of the council.\n\n===The Holy Spirit Church===\n\nThe main square is defined on one side by the church with its baroque architecture and the parochial house, and on the other side by the palatial mansions of affluent elite Catholics, positioned in a row. The ''Associa\u00e7\u00e3o das Communidades'' (Communities Association) building and the school being the odd exceptions which add to its character and sense of scale. They have a maximum height of two stories, and ''balc\u00f5es'' [[balcony|balconies]] and ''varandas'' ([[veranda]]s) facing the square. Parallel to the church square is the commercial street (old market). There is also a landscaped area next to the church called ''Pra\u00e7a da Alegria'' (Joy Square). The church feast is celebrated before the monsoons, it is a time when many residents make pre-monsoon purchases to stock up for a prolonged rainy season.\n\nMarg\u00e3o's importance as an administrative and commercial area grew with the increasing dependence of the surrounding towns and villages; leading to the administrative center with the town hall at its center being built in the south.\n\nIn 1961, Goa was freed from [[Portugal|Portuguese]] occupation and incorporated into the [[Indian Union]], and Marg\u00e3o was declared as the administrative center of the district of [[South Goa]].\n\n==Geography==\nMargao is located at {{Coord|15|16|25|N|73|57|29|E}}.

{"title_page": "World's Fastest Drummer", "text_new": "[[File:World's Fastest Drummer Logo.jpg|thumb]]\n'''World's Fastest Drummer/Extreme Sport Drumming''' is a competition for determining the world's fastest drummer. A drummer's speed is calculated and recorded by a digital counting device called the Drumometer. The [[Drumometer]], a patented electronic technology protected by [[U.S. Patent]] #6,545,207 was invented by Boo McAfee and Craig A. Kestner (aka Craig Alan) in 1999 for accurately counting drum strokes.<ref>http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser\nSect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6545207.PN.&OS=PN/6545207&RS=PN/6545207</ref> The Drumometer is accredited by [[Guinness World Records]] as the official device used to verify the World's Fastest Drummer.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Purpose==\nThe primary goal of most WFD competitions is to determine who can play the most single strokes in sixty seconds. According to author [[Joshua Davis (writer)|Josh Davis]], \"the [[Drumometer]] uncovered a deep well of competitiveness.\" After experimenting with various WFD competition formats in the [[Southern United States]], the event achieved international prominence when respected studio and clinic drummer [[Johnny Rabb]] became the first person to break 1,000 single strokes in 60 seconds, claiming the title World's Fastest Hands and recognition from the record keepers at Guinness. McAfee and Alan then officially sanctioned their events and copyrighted the phrase ''World's Fastest Drummer''. This was followed by ads in ''Drum!'' and ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' magazines touting Rabb's accomplishment and their Drumometer device. Subsequently, they created new classes of speed drumming: fastest feet (for two-footed bass drumming), bare hands, and tag team, among others. Drumometer orders then followed, and the race to best Rabb's feats began. [[Music genres]] - [[Death metal]], [[Country music|Country]], [[Jazz]], [[Rock music|Rock]] as well as [[Drum Corps International|Drum Corps]] have since battled for dominance in the various categories. In 2002, WFD world championships became a biannual affair (winter and summer), and were permanently stationed at [[NAMM]] conventions beginning in 2003.\n\n==Early years==\nEarly stars of the event in addition to Rabb included a veteran jazz drummer named Art Verdi, the first person to break 1100 single strokes and while using the [[traditional grip]]. Jotan Afanador, first person to regularly perform nearly 1200 single strokes in one minute. [[Tim Waterson]], first person to score over 1000 single strokes on a bass drum, and the first identifiable personality of the bass drum division via a series of instructional videos touting his widely emulated heel-toe technique.  Acquired in 2002 was the WFD's most recognizable competitor when [[Dream Theater]] drummer and former [[Berklee College of Music]] professor [[Mike Mangini]] joined its ranks. With the retirements of Rabb and others from active competition, the sport continued to witness runs by New Jersey website personality and [[Joe Morello]] student \"Tiger\" Bill Meligari. [[Seth Davis (musician)|Seth Davis]], 1000+ single stroker, WFD clinician for accuracy and timing demonstrations with the drumometer and first person to execute 1200 \"open\" double strokes. Sam Lecompte (the first person to play over 1000 paradiddles) and 2003 Summer winner Eric Okamoto.\n\n==New era==\nRecent champions{{When|date=August 2018}} include [[Matt Smith (drummer)|Matt Smith]], who at 16 became the youngest WFD champion and the harbinger of a new youth movement within the sport, and two bass drum competitors [[Tim Yeung]] and [[Mike \"Machine\" Mallais]]. Yeung was instrumental in popularizing the sport within that genre, while Mallais beat most of the existing bass drum world records formerly held by Waterson and Mangini at the Winter 2007 world championships. \n\nIn 2006 British drummer Rees Bridges became the first European to win a world's title, sparking greater interest in a WFD UK division, managed by drummer entrepreneur Ed Freitas. Later in 2006 WFD staged a national competition in Australia with smaller events held in Hong Kong and elsewhere, while the first official WFD China Championship is scheduled for 2012. After an extended hiatus WFD Championships returned to NAMM Conventions July 2011 with Australian Joey Moujalli and American Kevin Bernardy taking hands and feet titles respectively.\n\nIn July 2007 in Austin, Texas, WFD hands champion Thomas Grosset (age 16) performed 1156 single strokes in 1 minute matched grip, the highest score ever recorded in the final championship round. Tom's top preliminary run of 1194 made him the new WFD 16 and under World Record Holder and third in the world rankings just behind Afanador. In 2013, Grossett set the new world record of 1,208. Shortly after losing his 16 and under record, Matt Smith set a new world hands endurance record, and was followed closely by 18-year-old Daniel Rice, scoring 1108 in the preliminaries. In June 2008, Smith returned to break Mangini's traditional grip record of 1126, with a score of 1132, leaving the sport almost entirely in the hands of younger competitors. Mangini's former dominance of WFD has recently been deemphasized. He still holds the bare hand record (no sticks) of 1138 single strikes in 60 seconds.\n\n==Controversy==\nSince the competition's inception, drummers were divided into positive and negative camps, with this phenomenon rapidly accelerating as Mangini, Rabb, Verdi and Afanador especially surfaced on television programs and commercials, with opposing sides simultaneously battling in Internet drum forums, magazines and YouTube comments sections. WFD detractors have contended that musical instruments should not be used as tools for sport and depreciate musicality, while defenders{{Like whom?|date=August 2018}} cite the quest for technical excellence, and its innocence as a non-musical exercise. As the argument has become more complex, hundreds of WFD hopefuls issue unsubstantiated{{According to whom|date=August 2018}} Drumometer videos purporting to be world records.{{Example needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nAnother controversy centered around implementation of a hands technique called \"push-pull\" that allowed competitors to score more than one beat with a single motion but was neither a double stroke or buzz roll. In 2011 it was determined that push-pull qualified as a hybrid single stroke but requiring a separate category with its own records. The ruling further asserted that world rankings would remain limited to standard singles competitors.\n\n==WFD Champions==\n* Summer 2016 \"Fastest Hands\" Lizhou Wang  (1057) \"Fastest Feet\" Felix Garza III (847)\n* Summer 2015 \"Fastest Hands\" Braxton Burke (953) \"Fastest Feet\" Josh Robinson (899)\n* Spring 2015 \"Fastest Hands\" Charles Goodwin (926) \"Fastest Feet\" Josh Robinson (825)\n* Summer 2014 \"Fastest Hands\" Wang Peng   (1049) \"Fastest Feet\" [[Perry Dattilo]]  (840)\n* Summer 2013 \"Fastest Hands\" [[Dave Stroup]] (989) \"Fastest Feet\" [[Spencer Dalton]] (846)\n* Summer 2012 \"Fastest Hands\" [[Daniel Rice (drummer)|Daniel Rice]] (1005)  \"Fastest Feet\" Flo Mounier (890)\n* Summer 2011 \"Fastest Hands\" [[Joey Moujalli]] (995)  \"Fastest Feet\" [[Kevin Bernardy]] (860)\n* Winter 2007 \"Fastest Hands\" [[Jeff Guthery]] (1054)     \"Fastest Feet\" [[Mike Mallais]] (978)\n* Summer 2006 \"Fastest Hands\" [[Matt Smith (drummer)|Matt Smith]] (1030)       \"Fastest Feet\" [[Hensley Souryavong]] (774)\n* Winter 2006 \"Fastest Hands\" [[Rees Bridges]] (1007)     \"Fastest Feet\" [[Tim Yeung]] (872)\n* Summer 2005 \"Fastest Hands\" [[Randy Briggs]] (1021)     \"Fastest Feet\" [[Dan Prestup]] (858)\n* Autumn 2005 \"Fastest Hands\" [[Arne Widderich]] (924)     \"Fastest Feet\" [[Matt Garrett]] (888)\n* Summer 2004 \"Fastest Hands\" [[Sam LeCompte]] (1061)     \"Fastest Feet\" [[Adam Fachler]] (844)\n* Winter 2004 \"Fastest Hands\" [[Bill Meligari]] (1019)    \"Fastest Feet\" Mike Duncan (782)\n* Summer 2003 \"Fastest Hands\" [[Eric Okamoto]] (1018)     \"Fastest Feet\" [[Kermit Tarver]] (768)\n* Winter 2003 \"Fastest Hands\" [[Kai Katchadourian]] (909) \"Fastest Feet\" [[Reno Kiilerich]] (878)\n\n==2015 Legal Filings-Defending the Drumometer Patent US #6,545,207==\nMcAfee has filed patent infringement lawsuits in Chicago against Guitar Center, Ahead Products, Inc. and Cherub Technology Inc., who sell a similar drum stroke counting device, and Yamaha Corporation of America, who has incorporated a drum stroke counting feature in its popular line of DTX electronic drum kits.\n\nIn response to an ongoing controversy in the music world over who was, in fact, the world's fastest drummer, Boo McAfee teamed up with electrical engineer and drummer, Craig Alan Kestner, and developed the Drumometer\u2122 to accurately count drum strokes on a drum pad. McAfee and Kestner were awarded U.S. Patent No. 6,545,207 on their invention, and began promoting \u201cWorld\u2019s Fastest Drummer\u00ae\u201d (\u201cWFD\u201d) competitions with the Drumometer\u2122. Craig left Drumometer in 2007 to continue a career in engineering but still owns the first Drumometer prototype affectionately known as Frankenstein.\n\n\u201cExtreme Sport Drumming\u201d competitions are now regularly held worldwide, and have been featured on CNN, MTV, VH1, PBS, FOX and ESPN.  Boo McAfee and Extreme Sport Drumming were recently the subject of the film Fast Company, which opened to rave reviews at the Milwaukee Film Festival on September 27, 2015.\n\nThe popularity of Extreme Sport Drumming, however, has led to many imitators of McAfee's patented Drumometer\u2122.  After trying for years to license, or stop, the sales of copycat drum stroke counting devices, McAfee has now begun filing patent infringement lawsuits with the help of patent attorney Anthony Dowell of Chicago.\n\n\u201cI contacted all of the companies selling imitation drum stroke counting pads,\u201d McAfee said.  \u201cUnfortunately, none of them would respect my patent rights and pay a reasonable license fee.  Guitar Center told me they wouldn\u2019t even talk to me unless I filed \u2018formal proceedings.\u2019  So that's what we did.\u201d{{Context-inline|date=August 2018}} \n\n\u201cBoo\u2019s experience is common these days,\u201d patent attorney Anthony Dowell explained.  \u201cIn today\u2019s patent climate, companies have no respect for inventors or patent rights.  Most will ignore an inventor until a patent infringement lawsuit is filed. That usually gets their attention.\u201d{{Context-inline|date=August 2018}} \n\nDowell has filed three patent infringement lawsuits for McAfee in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the first against Guitar Center and Yamaha on October 27, 2015 (15-cv-9555) and two more against Ahead Products, Inc. (15-cv-10395) and Cherub Technology Inc. (15-cv-10403) on November 18, 2015.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n* By George Broyer [http://store.drumbum.com/drums/speed-drumming.htm \"The Rise of Speed Drumming\"], ''The Drumometer'' - Retrieved in 2005.\n* By Blabbermouth.net [http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/international-fastest-drummer-contest-to-be-held-at-namm/ \"International Speed Competition\"], ''NAMM 2006'' - Retrieved in 2006.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.worldsfastestdrummer.com Official World's Fastest Drummer website]\n* [http://drumometer.com Official Drumometer Website]\n* [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/churchs-chicken-marches-to-a-different-drumstick-with-2015-worlds-fastest-drummer-championship-april-15-18-300048828.html Church's Marches to a Different Drumstick]\n* [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/churchs-chicken-and-worlds-fastest-drummer-name-charles-goodwin-and-joshua-robinson-southeast-champions-2015-300069453.html WFD Church's Winners PR]\n* [http://extremesportdrumming.com/rules.html WFD Rules]\n\n[[Category:Drumming]]\n[[Category:Music competitions]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:World's Fastest Drummer Logo.jpg|thumb]]\n'''World's Fastest Drummer/Extreme Sport Drumming''' is a competition for determining the world's fastest drummer.
