People may choose fields, bushes, forests, ditches, streets, canals or other open space for defecation.

In ancient times, there were more open spaces and less population pressure on land.

With development and urbanization, open defecating started becoming a challenge and thereby an important [[public health]] issue, and an issue of human [[dignity]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=O'Reilly |first=Kathleen | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-01-01|title=From toilet insecurity to toilet security: creating safe sanitation for women and girls|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Water|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=19\u201324|doi=10.1002/wat2.1122|issn=2049-1948}}</ref> With the increase in population in smaller areas, such as cities and towns, more attention was given to hygiene and health.

This was due to the publications by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) and the UN [[International Year of Sanitation]]. The JMP is a joint program by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]].\n\nFor monitoring purposes, two categories were created: 1) [[improved sanitation]] and (2) [[unimproved sanitation]]. Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\n\nIn 2013 [[World Toilet Day]] was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/DSG%20sanitation%20two-pager%20FINAL.pdf|title=United Nations Deputy Secretary-General's Call to Action on Sanitation|date=2013|website=United Nations|access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Open defecation free ===\n\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in [[community-led total sanitation]] (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation.<ref name=\"Cavill\">{{cite book |url= http://www.communityledtotalsanitation.org/resource/frontiers-clts-issue-4-sustainability-and-clts-taking-stock |title=Sustainability and CLTS: Taking Stock Frontiers of CLTS: Innovations and Insights Issue 4 |last1=Cavill |last2=Chambers |last3=Vernon | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015 |publisher=IDS |isbn=978-1-78118-222-2 |page=18 }}</ref>\n\nThe Indian [[Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation]] has in mid-2015 defined ODF as \"the termination of [[fecal-oral transmission]], defined by:\n\n# No visible feces found in the environment or village and\n# Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdws.gov.in/sites/default/files/R_274_1441280478318.pdf|title=Guidelines for ODF Verification|date=2015|publisher=Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation}}</ref>\n\nHere, 'safe technology option' means toilets that contain feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://forum.susana.org/71-behaviour-change-and-user-psychology-issues/13746-definition-of-odf-open-defecation-free-indian-government-publication|title=Definition of ODF \u2013 Open Defecation Free (Indian government publication)|date=2015-06-18|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-gb}}</ref> This definition is part of the [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Campaign).\n\n== Reasons ==\n\nThe reasons for open defecation are varied.

This was due to the publications by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) and the UN [[International Year of Sanitation]]. The JMP is a joint program by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]].\n\nFor monitoring purposes, two categories were created: 1) [[improved sanitation]] and (2) [[unimproved sanitation]]. Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\n\nIn 2013 [[World Toilet Day]] was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/DSG%20sanitation%20two-pager%20FINAL.pdf|title=United Nations Deputy Secretary-General's Call to Action on Sanitation|date=2013|website=United Nations|access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Open defecation free ===\n\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in [[community-led total sanitation]] (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation.

Words that are synonyms are said to be '''synonymous''', and the state of being a synonym is called '''synonymy'''.

Different words that are similar in meaning usually differ for a reason: ''feline'' is more formal than ''cat''; ''long'' and ''extended'' are only synonyms in one usage and not in others (for example, a ''long arm'' is not the same as an ''extended arm''). Synonyms are also a source of [[euphemism]]s.\n\n[[Metonymy]] can sometimes be a form of synonymy: ''the [[White House]]'' is used as a synonym of ''the administration'' in referring to the U.S. [[executive (government)|executive branch]] under a specific president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=/A-AMERICA-N/USA/USA-Washington/DC-001.htm|title=World Architecture Images- The White House|website=www.essential-architecture.com|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> Thus a metonym is a type of synonym, and the word ''metonym'' is a [[hyponymy and hypernymy|hyponym]] of the word ''synonym''.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe analysis of synonymy, [[polysemy]], hyponymy, and [[hyponymy and hypernymy|hypernymy]] is inherent to [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] and [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] in the [[information science|information-science]] senses of those terms.<ref>Hirst, Graeme. \"[ftp://ftp.db.toronto.edu/public_html/dist/gh/Hirst-Ontol-2009-as-published.pdf Ontology and the lexicon].\" Handbook on ontologies.

Examples:\n\n*noun\n**''drink'' and ''beverage''\n*verb\n**''buy'' and ''purchase''\n*adjective\n**''big'' and ''large''\n*adverb\n**''quickly'' and ''speedily''\n*preposition\n** ''on'' and ''upon''\n*noun\n** ''[[Weekly Shonen Sunday]]'' and ''[[Ku Klux Klan]]''\n\nSynonyms are defined with respect to certain senses of words: ''pupil'' as the ''aperture in the iris of the eye'' is not synonymous with ''student''. Such like, ''he expired'' means the same as ''he died'', yet ''my passport has expired'' cannot be replaced by ''my passport has died''.\n\nIn English, many synonyms emerged in the [[Middle Ages]], after the [[Norman conquest of England]]. While England's new ruling class spoke [[Norman French]], the lower classes continued to speak [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon). As Old English became more developed, more words would be borrowed from a variety of languages, resulting in more synonyms.<ref>{{Cite book|url=/books?hl=en&lr=&id=3qs0AQAAMAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=origin+on+english+synonym&ots=dgutkQZOqK&sig=wPqhozO_CsN6CkjZ0eH2lDz51Eo#v=onepage&q=synonym&f=false|title=The Making of English|last=Bradley|first=Henry|date=1922|publisher=Macmillan and Company, Limited|language=en}}</ref> Thus, today we have synonyms like the Norman-derived ''people'', ''liberty'' and ''archer'', and the Saxon-derived ''folk'', ''freedom'' and ''bowman''. For more examples, see the [[list of Germanic and Latinate equivalents in English]].\n\nA [[thesaurus]] lists similar or related words; these are often, but not always, synonyms.\n\n* The word '''''poecilonym''''' is a rare synonym of the word ''synonym''. It is not entered in most major dictionaries and is a curiosity or piece of trivia for being an [[autological word]] because of its [[meta]] quality as a synonym of ''synonym''.\n* '''[[Antonym]]s''' are words with opposite or nearly opposite meanings. For example: ''hot'' \u2194 ''cold'', ''large'' \u2194 ''small'', ''thick'' \u2194 ''thin'', ''synonym'' \u2194 ''antonym'' \n* [[Hyponymy and hypernymy|'''Hypernyms''' and '''hyponyms''']] are words that refer to, respectively, a general category and a specific instance of that category. For example, ''vehicle'' is a hypernym of ''car'', and ''car'' is a hyponym of ''vehicle''.\n* '''[[Homophone]]s''' are words that have the same pronunciation, but different meanings. For example, ''witch'' and ''which'' are homophones in most accents (because they are pronounced the same).\n* '''[[Homograph]]s''' are words that have the same spelling, but have different pronunciations. For example, one can ''record'' a song or keep a ''record'' of documents.\n* '''[[Homonym]]s''' are words that have the same pronunciation and spelling, but have different meanings. For example, ''rose'' (a type of flower) and ''rose'' (past tense of ''rise'') are homonyms.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[-onym]]\n* [[Cognitive synonymy]]\n* [[Elegant variation]], the gratuitous use of a synonym in prose\n* [[Synonym ring]]\n* [[Synonymy in Japanese]]\n* {{Annotated link|Thesaurus|Thesauri and synonym dictionaries}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\nTools which graph words relations:\n* [https://graphwords.com/ GraphWords] \u2013 Online tool for visualization word relations\n* [http://www.synonyms.net/ Synonyms.net] \u2013 Online reference resource that provides instant synonyms and antonyms definitions including visualizations, voice pronunciations and translations\n* [http://www.atlas-semantiques.eu/?l=EN English/French Semantic Atlas] \u2013 Graph words relations in English, French and gives cross representations for translations \u2013 offers 500 searches per user per day.\n\nPlain words synonyms finder:\n* [https://www.synonym-finder.com/ Synonym Finder] \u2013 Synonym finder including hypernyms in search result\n* [http://trovami.altervista.org/sinonimi/en Thesaurus] \u2013 Online synonyms in English, Italian, French and German\n* [http://synonyms.woxikon.com/ Woxikon Synonyms] \u2013 Over 1 million synonyms \u2013 English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish and Dutch\n* [http://www.findmewords.com/synonyms.html FindMeWords Synonyms] \u2013 Online Synonym Dictionary with definitions\n* [http://www.classicthesaurus.com Classic Thesaurus] \u2013 Crowdsourced synonym dictionary\n* [https://www.powerthesaurus.org/ Power Thesaurus] \u2013 Synonym dictionary with definitions and examples and other references\n* [https://pasttenses.com/ Past Tenses Synonyms] \u2013 Online synonym finding website\n\n{{Lexicology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Lexical semantics]]\n[[Category:Types of words]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the general meaning of \"synonym\"}}\n{{short description|Words or phrases having the same meaning}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Library of Ashurbanipal synonym list tablet.jpg|thumb|Synonym list in [[cuneiform]] on a clay tablet, [[Neo-Assyrian]] period<ref>{{British-Museum-db|K.4375|id=308401}}</ref>]]\n\nA '''synonym''' is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language.

Synonyms are also a source of [[euphemism]]s.\n\n[[Metonymy]] can sometimes be a form of synonymy: ''the [[White House]]'' is used as a synonym of ''the administration'' in referring to the U.S. [[executive (government)|executive branch]] under a specific president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.essential-architecture.com/A-AMERICA-N/USA/USA-Washington/DC-001.htm|title=World Architecture Images- The White House|website=www.essential-architecture.com|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> Thus a metonym is a type of synonym, and the word ''metonym'' is a [[hyponymy and hypernymy|hyponym]] of the word ''synonym''.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe analysis of synonymy, [[polysemy]], hyponymy, and [[hyponymy and hypernymy|hypernymy]] is inherent to [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] and [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] in the [[information science|information-science]] senses of those terms.<ref>Hirst, Graeme. \"[ftp://ftp.db.toronto.edu/public_html/dist/gh/Hirst-Ontol-2009-as-published.pdf Ontology and the lexicon].\" Handbook on ontologies. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2009. 269-292.</ref> It has applications in [[pedagogy]] and [[machine learning]], because they rely on [[word-sense disambiguation]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turney|first=Peter D.|date=2008|title=A Uniform Approach to Analogies, Synonyms, Antonyms, and Associations|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1599081.1599195|journal=Proceedings of the 22Nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics - Volume 1|series=COLING '08|location=Stroudsburg, PA, USA|publisher=Association for Computational Linguistics|pages=905\u2013912|isbn=978-1-905593-44-6}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word comes from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''s\u00fdn'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd]]}}; \"with\") and ''\u00f3noma'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1|\u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1]]}}; \"name\").\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Synonym.png|English language]]\n\nSynonyms can be any [[part of speech]], as long as both words belong to the same part of speech. Examples:\n\n*noun\n**''drink'' and ''beverage''\n*verb\n**''buy'' and ''purchase''\n*adjective\n**''big'' and ''large''\n*adverb\n**''quickly'' and ''speedily''\n*preposition\n** ''on'' and ''upon''\n\nSynonyms are defined with respect to certain senses of words: ''pupil'' as the ''aperture in the iris of the eye'' is not synonymous with ''student''. Such like, ''he expired'' means the same as ''he died'', yet ''my passport has expired'' cannot be replaced by ''my passport has died''.\n\nIn English, many synonyms emerged in the [[Middle Ages]], after the [[Norman conquest of England]]. While England's new ruling class spoke [[Norman French]], the lower classes continued to speak [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon). As Old English became more developed, more words would be borrowed from a variety of languages, resulting in more synonyms.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=3qs0AQAAMAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=origin+on+english+synonym&ots=dgutkQZOqK&sig=wPqhozO_CsN6CkjZ0eH2lDz51Eo#v=onepage&q=synonym&f=false|title=The Making of English|last=Bradley|first=Henry|date=1922|publisher=Macmillan and Company, Limited|language=en}}</ref> Thus, today we have synonyms like the Norman-derived ''people'', ''liberty'' and ''archer'', and the Saxon-derived ''folk'', ''freedom'' and ''bowman''. For more examples, see the [[list of Germanic and Latinate equivalents in English]].\n\nA [[thesaurus]] lists similar or related words; these are often, but not always, synonyms.\n\n* The word '''''poecilonym''''' is a rare synonym of the word ''synonym''. It is not entered in most major dictionaries and is a curiosity or piece of trivia for being an [[autological word]] because of its [[meta]] quality as a synonym of ''synonym''.\n* '''[[Antonym]]s''' are words with opposite or nearly opposite meanings. For example: ''hot'' \u2194 ''cold'', ''large'' \u2194 ''small'', ''thick'' \u2194 ''thin'', ''synonym'' \u2194 ''antonym'' \n* [[Hyponymy and hypernymy|'''Hypernyms''' and '''hyponyms''']] are words that refer to, respectively, a general category and a specific instance of that category. For example, ''vehicle'' is a hypernym of ''car'', and ''car'' is a hyponym of ''vehicle''.\n* '''[[Homophone]]s''' are words that have the same pronunciation, but different meanings. For example, ''witch'' and ''which'' are homophones in most accents (because they are pronounced the same).\n* '''[[Homograph]]s''' are words that have the same spelling, but have different pronunciations. For example, one can ''record'' a song or keep a ''record'' of documents.\n* '''[[Homonym]]s''' are words that have the same pronunciation and spelling, but have different meanings. For example, ''rose'' (a type of flower) and ''rose'' (past tense of ''rise'') are homonyms.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[-onym]]\n* [[Cognitive synonymy]]\n* [[Elegant variation]], the gratuitous use of a synonym in prose\n* [[Synonym ring]]\n* [[Synonymy in Japanese]]\n* {{Annotated link|Thesaurus|Thesauri and synonym dictionaries}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\nTools which graph words relations:\n* [https://graphwords.com/ GraphWords] \u2013 Online tool for visualization word relations\n* [http://www.synonyms.net/ Synonyms.net] \u2013 Online reference resource that provides instant synonyms and antonyms definitions including visualizations, voice pronunciations and translations\n* [http://www.atlas-semantiques.eu/?l=EN English/French Semantic Atlas] \u2013 Graph words relations in English, French and gives cross representations for translations \u2013 offers 500 searches per user per day.\n\nPlain words synonyms finder:\n* [https://www.synonym-finder.com/ Synonym Finder] \u2013 Synonym finder including hypernyms in search result\n* [http://trovami.altervista.org/sinonimi/en Thesaurus] \u2013 Online synonyms in English, Italian, French and German\n* [http://synonyms.woxikon.com/ Woxikon Synonyms] \u2013 Over 1 million synonyms \u2013 English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish and Dutch\n* [http://www.findmewords.com/synonyms.html FindMeWords Synonyms] \u2013 Online Synonym Dictionary with definitions\n* [http://www.classicthesaurus.com Classic Thesaurus] \u2013 Crowdsourced synonym dictionary\n* [https://www.powerthesaurus.org/ Power Thesaurus] \u2013 Synonym dictionary with definitions and examples and other references\n* [https://pasttenses.com/ Past Tenses Synonyms] \u2013 Online synonym finding website\n\n{{Lexicology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Lexical semantics]]\n[[Category:Types of words]]\n", "name_user": "216.222.194.236", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Undid revision 951111938 byNicoScribe(talk) NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WEEKLY SHONEN SUNDAY AND THE KKK)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym"}

Of all the counties won by inaugural Republican Party presidential nominee [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont|John Charles Fr\u00e9mont]] [[1856 United States presidential election|in 1856]], Carroll County was to maintain the longest unbroken string of supporting the GOP in subsequent elections. It would give a plurality to every subsequent Republican Presidential nominee up to [[George W. Bush]] in 2004, beating by three elections the second longest run of Indiana's [[Porter County, Indiana|Porter County]] which was to give a plurality to [[Bill Clinton]] [[United States presidential election in Indiana, 1996|in 1996]].\n\nIn that 1996 election [[Bob Dole]] won Carroll County by only 1.51 percentage points \u2013 the smallest margin by a Republican to that point \u2013 and in 2008 Illinois native [[Barack Obama]] broke this last remaining GOP streak stretching back to Fr\u00e9mont by carrying the county by 4.80 percentage points. Obama was to repeat his win in 2012 by 1.49 percent, but a dramatic swing to Republican Donald Trump in 2016 saw him win by the largest margin since [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2019s 1984 landslide by gaining 59.6% of the vote in Carroll County, scoring slightly higher than George H.W. Bush's victory in 1988 in which Bush won 59.4% of the vote in Carroll County.\n\nThe largest margin of victory ever in Carroll County was achieved by [[Warren G. Harding]] who won 86.7% of votes in the county during the [[1920 United States presidential election]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Carroll County, Illinois]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.carroll-county.net/ Carroll County Government]\n* [http://visitcarrollcountyil.com/ Visit Carroll County]\n* [http://www.chadwickil.com/ Village of Chadwick]\n* [http://www.lanarkil.com/ City of Lanark]\n* [http://www.milledgevilleil.net/ Village of Milledgeville]\n* [http://www.mtcarrollil.org/ City of Mt.

Of all the counties won by inaugural Republican Party presidential nominee [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont|John Charles Fr\u00e9mont]] [[1856 United States presidential election|in 1856]], Carroll County was to maintain the longest unbroken string of supporting the GOP in subsequent elections. It would give a plurality to every subsequent Republican Presidential nominee up to [[George W. Bush]] in 2004, beating by three elections the second longest run of Indiana's [[Porter County, Indiana|Porter County]] which was to give a plurality to [[Bill Clinton]] [[United States presidential election in Indiana, 1996|in 1996]].\n\nIn that 1996 election [[Bob Dole]] won Carroll County by only 1.51 percentage points \u2013 the smallest margin by a Republican to that point \u2013 and in 2008 Illinois native [[Barack Obama]] broke this last remaining GOP streak stretching back to Fr\u00e9mont by carrying the county by 4.80 percentage points. Obama was to repeat his win in 2012 by 1.49 percent, but a dramatic swing to Republican Donald Trump in 2016 saw him win by the largest margin since [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2019s 1984 landslide by gaining 59.6% of the vote in Carroll County, scoring slightly higher than George H.W. Bush's victory in 1988 in which Bush won 59.4% of the vote in Carroll County.\n\nThe largest margin of victory ever in Carroll County was achieved by [[Warren G. Harding]] who won 86.7% of votes in the county during the [[1920 United States presidential election]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Carroll County, Illinois]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.carroll-county.net/ Carroll County Government]\n*[http://visitcarrollcountyil.com/ Visit Carroll County]\n*[http://www.chadwickil.com/ Village of Chadwick]\n*[http://www.lanarkil.com/ City of Lanark]\n*[http://www.milledgevilleil.net/ Village of Milledgeville]\n*[http://www.mtcarrollil.org/ City of Mt.
