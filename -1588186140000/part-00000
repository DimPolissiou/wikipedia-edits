The [[Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party]], led by [[Kim Jong-un]], governs the DPRK in a monopoly coalition with the [[Korean Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Chondoist Chongu Party]] called the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea|Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland]]. Elections are held in five-year intervals, the most recent taking place in 2019. Although the Supreme People's Assembly is the primary legislative body of the DPRK, it ordinarily delegates authority to the smaller and more powerful [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Presidium]], chosen from among its members.\n\n==Leadership==\n*'''President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly'''\n::[[Kim Yong-nam]]\n*'''Vice Presidents of the

{"title_page": "Abortion in the United States", "text_new": "{{short description|Termination of a pregnancy in the United States}}\n\n[[Abortion]] is legal throughout the [[United States]] and its territories, although restrictions and accessibility vary from state to state. Abortion is a controversial and divisive issue in the society, culture and politics of the U.S., and various [[Abortion law|anti-abortion laws]] have been in force in each state since at least 1900.Before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decisions of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' decriminalized abortion nationwide in 1973, abortion was already legal in several states, but the decision imposed a uniform framework for state legislation on the subject. It established a minimal period during which abortion is legal (with more or fewer restrictions throughout the pregnancy). \n\n==Terminology==\n{{Main|Abortion}}\nThe abortion debate most commonly relates to the \"[[induced abortion]]\" of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense.<ref>According to the Supreme Court's decision in ''Roe v. Wade'':\n<blockquote>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.\n\n(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\n\n(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>\n\nLikewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as \"knowing destruction\" or \"intentional expulsion or removal\".</ref> Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before [[Viability]] at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Watson |first1=Katie |title= Why We Should Stop Using the Term \"Elective Abortion\"|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=1175\u20131180 |date=20 Dec 2019 |doi=10.1001/amajethics.2018.1175 |pmid=30585581 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nIn medical parlance, \"abortion\" can refer to either [[miscarriage]] or abortion until the fetus is viable.

Additionally, various anti-abortion statutes began to appear in the United States in the 1820s that codified or expanded common law. In 1821, a [[Connecticut]] law targeted [[apothecary|apothecaries]] who sold \"poisons\" to women for purposes of inducing an abortion, and [[New York (state)|New York]] made post-quickening abortions a felony and pre-quickening abortions a misdemeanor in 1829.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buell|first=Samuel|date=1991|title=Criminal Abortion Revisited|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2798&context=faculty_scholarship|journal=New York University Law Review|volume=66:1774|issue=6|pages=1774\u2013831|via=duke.edu|pmid=11652642}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2019|reason=Source does not include any reference to the 1829 NY law.}} Other legal scholars have pointed out that some of the early laws punished not only the doctor or abortionist, but also the woman who hired them.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Suzanne M. |last1=Alford |url=http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?52+Duke+L.+J.+1011 |title=Is Self-Abortion a Fundamental Right? |volume=52 |journal=Duke Law Journal |pages=1011\u201329 |issue=5 |year=2003 |jstor=1373127 |pmid=12964572}}</ref>\n\nA number of other factors likely played a role in the rise of anti-abortion laws. [[Physician]]s, who were the leading advocates of abortion criminalization laws, appear to have been motivated at least in part by advances in medical knowledge. Science had discovered that [[Fertilisation|conception]] inaugurated a more or less continuous process of development, which would produce a new human being if uninterrupted.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Moreover, [[quickening]] was found to be neither more nor less crucial in the process of [[gestation]] than any other step. Many physicians concluded that if society considered it unjustifiable to terminate pregnancy after the fetus had quickened, and if quickening was a relatively unimportant step in the gestation process, then it was just as wrong to terminate a pregnancy before quickening as after quickening.<ref name=\"Mohr3536\">{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|author=James C.

Retrieved 11 January 2017.</ref> Early that year, on January 22, 1973, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' invalidated all of these laws, and set guidelines for the availability of abortion. ''Roe'' established that the [[right of privacy]] of a woman to obtain an abortion \"must be considered against important state interests in regulation\".<ref>''Roe v. Wade'', {{ussc|410|113|1973|source=j|pin=154}} \"We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified, and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.\"</ref> ''Roe'' established a \"[[Gestation#Humans|trimester]]\" (i.e., 12 week) threshold of state interest in the life of the fetus corresponding to its increasing \"viability\" (likelihood of survival outside the uterus) over the course of a pregnancy, such that states were prohibited from banning abortion early in pregnancy but allowed to impose increasing restrictions or outright bans later in pregnancy.\n\nIn deciding ''Roe v. Wade'', the Supreme Court ruled that a [[Texas]] statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional.[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''] The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]] (in the sense of the right of a person not to be encroached by the state). In its opinion, it listed several landmark cases where the court had previously found a right to privacy implied by the Constitution. The Court did not recognize a right to abortion in all cases:<blockquote>State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.<ref>''Roe v. Wade'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/410/113.html 410 U.S. 113]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (1972). Findlaw.com. Retrieved 2011-04-14.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being.\n\nA central issue in the ''Roe'' case (and in the wider abortion debate in general) is whether human life or personhood begins at conception, birth, or at some point in between. The Court declined to make an attempt at resolving this issue, noting: \"We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.\"[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''] Instead, it chose to point out that historically, under English and American [[common law]] and statutes, \"the unborn have never been recognized ... as persons in the whole sense\", and thus, the fetuses are not legally entitled to the protection afforded by the right to life specifically enumerated in the Fourteenth Amendment. So, rather than asserting that human life begins at any specific point, the court simply declared that the State has a \"compelling interest\" in protecting \"potential life\" at the point of viability.\n\n====''Doe v. Bolton''====\n{{Main|Doe v. Bolton}}\nUnder ''[[Roe v.

Casey|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=878}}</ref> ''Roe'' had held that statutes regulating abortion must be subject to \"[[strict scrutiny]]\" \u2014 the traditional Supreme Court test for impositions upon fundamental [[U.S. Constitution|Constitutional]] rights. ''Casey'' instead adopted the lower,   [[undue burden]] standard for evaluating state abortion restrictions,<ref>{{ussc|name=Planned Parenthood v.

Wade'' while at the same time accommodating the State's profound interest in potential life, we will employ the undue burden analysis as explained in this opinion. An undue burden exists, and therefore, a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\")</ref> but re-emphasized the right to abortion as grounded in the general sense of liberty and privacy protected under the [[United States Constitution|constitution]]: \"Constitutional protection of the woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the [[Fourteenth Amendment Due Process|Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. It declares that no State shall 'deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' The controlling word in the cases before us is 'liberty'.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', {{ussc|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=846}}</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court continues to grapple with cases on the subject. On April 18, 2007, it issued a ruling in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', involving a federal law entitled the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]] which President [[George W. Bush]] had signed into law. The law banned [[intact dilation and extraction]], which opponents of abortion rights referred to as \"partial-birth abortion\", and stipulated that anyone breaking the law would get a prison sentence up to 2.5 years. The United States Supreme Court upheld the 2003 ban by a narrow majority of 5-4, marking the first time the Court has allowed a ban on any type of abortion since 1973. The opinion, which came from justice Anthony Kennedy, was joined by Justices [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Clarence Thomas]], and the two recent appointees, [[Samuel Alito]] and Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]].\n\nIn the case of ''[[Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt]]'', the Supreme Court in a 5-3 decision on June 27, 2016 swept away forms of state restrictions on the way abortion clinics can function. The Texas legislature enacted in 2013 restrictions on the delivery of abortions services that created an undue burden for women seeking an abortion by requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain \"admitting privileges\" at a local hospital and by requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities. The Court struck down these two provisions \"facially\" from [[Texas House Bill 2|the law at issue]]\u2014that is, the very words of the provisions were invalid, no matter how they might be applied in any practical situation. According to the Supreme Court, the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to abortion belongs with the courts, and not the legislatures.<ref name=\"20160627SCOTUSDenniston\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-abortion-rights-reemerge-strongly/|title=Whole Woman's Health v.

Gee]]'' in the 2019 term, a case resulting from a Louisiana state law that was passed at a similar time as the Texas law at the center of ''Whole Woman's Health''. Like Texas' law, the Louisiana law required certain measures for abortion clinics that, if having gone into effect, would have closed five of the six clinics in the state. The case in Louisiana was put on hold pending the result of ''Whole Woman's Health'', and was retried based on the Supreme Court's decision. While the District Court ruled the law unconstitutional, the Fifth Circuit found that unlike the Texas law, the burden of the Louisiana law passed the tests outlined in ''Whole Woman's Health'', and thus the law was constitutional. The Supreme Court issued an order to suspend enforcement of the law pending further review, and agreed to hear the case in full in October 2019. It will be the first abortion-related case to be heard by President [[Donald Trump]]'s appointees to the Court, [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Bret Kavanaugh]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-to-review-ruling-on-louisiana-abortion-law/2019/10/04/85eaf2b0-e6ab-11e9-a6e8-8759c5c7f608_story.html | title = Supreme Court to review ruling on Louisiana abortion law | first= Robert | last= Barnes | date =  October 4, 2019 | accessdate = October 4, 2019 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}</ref>\n\n==Current legal status{{anchor|Current_legal_situation}}==\n\n===Federal legislation===\nSince 1995, led by congressional [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]], the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] have moved several times to pass measures banning the procedure of [[intact dilation and extraction]], commonly known as partial birth abortion. Such measures passed twice by wide margins, but [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] [[veto]]ed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions. Congressional supporters of the bill argue that a health exception would render the bill unenforceable, since the ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' decision defined \"health\" in vague terms, justifying any motive for obtaining an abortion. Congress was unsuccessful with subsequent attempts to override the vetoes.\n\nThe [[Born-Alive Infants Protection Act|Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002]] (\"BAIPA\") was enacted August 5, 2002 by an Act of Congress and signed into law by George W. Bush. It asserts the human rights of infants born after a failed attempt to induce abortion. A \"born-alive infant\" is specified as a \"person, human being, child, individual\". \"Born alive\" is defined as the complete expulsion of an infant at any stage of development that has a heartbeat, pulsation of the umbilical cord, breath, or voluntary muscle movement, no matter if the umbilical cord has been cut or if the expulsion of the infant was natural, induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion.\n\nOn October 2, 2003, with a vote of 281-142, the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] approved the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] to ban partial-birth abortion, with an exemption in cases of fatal threats to the woman. Through this legislation, a doctor could face up to two years in prison and civil lawsuits for performing such a procedure. A woman undergoing the procedure could not be prosecuted under the measure. On October 21, 2003, the [[United States Senate]] passed the bill by a vote of 64-34, with a number of Democrats joining in support. The bill was signed by President [[George W.

Wade'', and subsequent companion decisions, is that abortion is legal but may be restricted by the states to varying degrees. States have passed laws to restrict late-term abortions, require parental notification for minors, and mandate the disclosure of abortion risk information to patients prior to the procedure.<ref>[http://www.lawserver.com/abortion Interactive maps comparing U.S. abortion restrictions by state], LawServer</ref>\n\nThe official report of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, issued in 1983 after extensive hearings on the [[Human Life Amendment]] (proposed by Senators [[Orrin Hatch]] and [[Thomas Eagleton]]), stated that\n\n{{quote|Thus, the [Judiciary] Committee observes that no significant legal barriers of any kind whatsoever exist today in the United States for a mother to obtain an abortion for any reason during any stage of her pregnancy.<ref>Report, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, on Senate Joint Resolution 3, 98th Congress, 98-149, June 7, 1983, p. 6.</ref>}}\n\nOne aspect of the legal abortion regime now in place has been determining when the [[fetus]] is \"[[Fetal viability|viable]]\" outside the womb as a measure of when the \"life\" of the fetus is its own (and therefore subject to being protected by the state). In the majority opinion delivered by the court in ''Roe v. Wade'', viability was defined as \"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. Viability is usually placed at about [[Prenatal Development|seven months]] (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks\". When the court ruled in 1973, the then-current medical technology suggested that viability could occur as early as 24 weeks.

Nominees typically remain silent on the issue during their hearings, as the issue may come before them as judges.\n\nThe [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]], commonly known as \"[[Laci Peterson|Laci]] and Conner's Law\" was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush on April 1, 2004, allowing two charges to be filed against someone who kills a pregnant mother (one for the mother and one for the fetus). It specifically bans charges against the mother and/or doctor relating to abortion procedures. Nevertheless, it has generated much controversy among pro-abortion rights advocates who view it as a potential step in the direction of banning abortion.\n\nThe [[Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act]] is a [[United States Congress]] bill to ban late-term abortions nationwide after 20 weeks post-[[fertilization]] on the basis that the fetus is capable of feeling pain during an abortion at and after that point of pregnancy. The bill was first introduced in Congress in 2013. It successfully passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2013, 2015, and 2017, but has yet to pass the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Opponents of the bill reject the claims made by the bill's supporters regarding fetal development, and argue that such a restriction would endanger women's health.\n\n[[File:AbortionRestrictions2013.svg|thumb|This map demonstrates an increase in abortion restrictions and a simultaneous decrease in abortion access in the US in 2013.

The cost of an abortion varies depending on factors such as location, facility, timing, and type of procedure. In 2005, a non-hospital abortion at 10 weeks' gestation ranged from $90 to $1,800 (average: $430), whereas an abortion at 20 weeks' gestation ranged from $350 to $4,520 (average: $1,260).

The law requires that states cover abortions under Medicaid in the event of rape, incest, and life endangerment. Based on the federal law:\n* 32 states and D. C. fund abortions through Medicaid only in the cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. SD covers abortions only in the cases of life endangerment, which does not comply with federal requirements under the Hyde Amendment.

Abortion is a controversial and divisive issue in the society, culture and politics of the U.S., and various [[Abortion law|anti-abortion laws]] have been in force in each state since at least 1900.Before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decisions of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' decriminalized abortion nationwide in 1973, abortion was already legal in several states, but the decision imposed a uniform framework for state legislation on the subject. It established a minimal period during which abortion is legal (with more or fewer restrictions throughout the pregnancy). \n\n==Terminology==\n{{Main|Abortion}}\nThe abortion debate most commonly relates to the \"[[induced abortion]]\" of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense.<ref>According to the Supreme Court's decision in ''Roe v. Wade'':\n<blockquote>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.\n\n(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\n\n(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>\n\nLikewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as \"knowing destruction\" or \"intentional expulsion or removal\".</ref> Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before [[Viability]] at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Watson |first1=Katie |title= Why We Should Stop Using the Term \"Elective Abortion\"|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=1175\u20131180 |date=20 Dec 2019 |doi=10.1001/amajethics.2018.1175 |pmid=30585581 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nIn medical parlance, \"abortion\" can refer to either [[miscarriage]] or abortion until the fetus is viable.

[[Physician]]s, who were the leading advocates of abortion criminalization laws, appear to have been motivated at least in part by advances in medical knowledge. Science had discovered that [[Fertilisation|conception]] inaugurated a more or less continuous process of development, which would produce a new human being if uninterrupted.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Moreover, [[quickening]] was found to be neither more nor less crucial in the process of [[gestation]] than any other step. Many physicians concluded that if society considered it unjustifiable to terminate pregnancy after the fetus had quickened, and if quickening was a relatively unimportant step in the gestation process, then it was just as wrong to terminate a pregnancy before quickening as after quickening.<ref name=\"Mohr3536\">{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|author=James C.

''Roe'' established that the [[right of privacy]] of a woman to obtain an abortion \"must be considered against important state interests in regulation\".<ref>''Roe v. Wade'', {{ussc|410|113|1973|source=j|pin=154}} \"We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified, and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.\"</ref> ''Roe'' established a \"[[Gestation#Humans|trimester]]\" (i.e., 12 week) threshold of state interest in the life of the fetus corresponding to its increasing \"viability\" (likelihood of survival outside the uterus) over the course of a pregnancy, such that states were prohibited from banning abortion early in pregnancy but allowed to impose increasing restrictions or outright bans later in pregnancy.\n\nIn deciding ''Roe v. Wade'', the Supreme Court ruled that a [[Texas]] statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional. The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]] (in the sense of the right of a person not to be encroached by the state). In its opinion, it listed several landmark cases where the court had previously found a right to privacy implied by the Constitution. The Court did not recognize a right to abortion in all cases:<blockquote>State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.<ref>''Roe v.

Retrieved 2011-04-14.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being.\n\nA central issue in the ''Roe'' case (and in the wider abortion debate in general) is whether human life or personhood begins at conception, birth, or at some point in between. The Court declined to make an attempt at resolving this issue, noting: \"We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.\" Instead, it chose to point out that historically, under English and American [[common law]] and statutes, \"the unborn have never been recognized ... as persons in the whole sense\", and thus, the fetuses are not legally entitled to the protection afforded by the right to life specifically enumerated in the Fourteenth Amendment. So, rather than asserting that human life begins at any specific point, the court simply declared that the State has a \"compelling interest\" in protecting \"potential life\" at the point of viability.\n\n====''Doe v.

Wade and Doe v. Bolton, ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), modified it allowing it to remain nominally in place. Although, the effective availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state, as many [[County|counties]] have no abortion providers.<ref name=\"Doan3\">{{cite book|author1=Alesha Doan|title=Opposition and Intimidation: The Abortion Wars and Strategies of Political Harassment|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472069750|page=57}}</ref> ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' held that a law cannot place legal restrictions imposing an [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] for \"the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\"<ref>Casey, 505 U.S. at 877.</ref> Therefore, in the 1992 case of ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', the Court abandoned ''Roe's'' strict trimester framework but maintained its central holding that women have a right to choose to have an abortion before viability.<ref>{{ussc|name=Planned Parenthood v. Casey|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=878}}</ref> ''Roe'' had held that statutes regulating abortion must be subject to \"[[strict scrutiny]]\" \u2014 the traditional Supreme Court test for impositions upon fundamental [[U.S. Constitution|Constitutional]] rights. ''Casey'' instead adopted the lower,   [[undue burden]] standard for evaluating state abortion restrictions,<ref>{{ussc|name=Planned Parenthood v. Casey|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=878}} (\"(a) To protect the central right recognized by ''Roe v. Wade'' while at the same time accommodating the State's profound interest in potential life, we will employ the undue burden analysis as explained in this opinion. An undue burden exists, and therefore, a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\")</ref> but re-emphasized the right to abortion as grounded in the general sense of liberty and privacy protected under the [[United States Constitution|constitution]]: \"Constitutional protection of the woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the [[Fourteenth Amendment Due Process|Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. It declares that no State shall 'deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' The controlling word in the cases before us is 'liberty'.\"<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', {{ussc|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=846}}</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court continues to grapple with cases on the subject. On April 18, 2007, it issued a ruling in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', involving a federal law entitled the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]] which President [[George W. Bush]] had signed into law. The law banned [[intact dilation and extraction]], which opponents of abortion rights referred to as \"partial-birth abortion\", and stipulated that anyone breaking the law would get a prison sentence up to 2.5 years. The United States Supreme Court upheld the 2003 ban by a narrow majority of 5-4, marking the first time the Court has allowed a ban on any type of abortion since 1973. The opinion, which came from justice Anthony Kennedy, was joined by Justices [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Clarence Thomas]], and the two recent appointees, [[Samuel Alito]] and Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]].\n\nIn the case of ''[[Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt]]'', the Supreme Court in a 5-3 decision on June 27, 2016 swept away forms of state restrictions on the way abortion clinics can function. The Texas legislature enacted in 2013 restrictions on the delivery of abortions services that created an undue burden for women seeking an abortion by requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain \"admitting privileges\" at a local hospital and by requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities. The Court struck down these two provisions \"facially\" from [[Texas House Bill 2|the law at issue]]\u2014that is, the very words of the provisions were invalid, no matter how they might be applied in any practical situation. According to the Supreme Court, the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to abortion belongs with the courts, and not the legislatures.<ref name=\"20160627SCOTUSDenniston\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-abortion-rights-reemerge-strongly/|title=Whole Woman's Health v.

Gee]]'' in the 2019 term, a case resulting from a Louisiana state law that was passed at a similar time as the Texas law at the center of ''Whole Woman's Health''. Like Texas' law, the Louisiana law required certain measures for abortion clinics that, if having gone into effect, would have closed five of the six clinics in the state. The case in Louisiana was put on hold pending the result of ''Whole Woman's Health'', and was retried based on the Supreme Court's decision. While the District Court ruled the law unconstitutional, the Fifth Circuit found that unlike the Texas law, the burden of the Louisiana law passed the tests outlined in ''Whole Woman's Health'', and thus the law was constitutional. The Supreme Court issued an order to suspend enforcement of the law pending further review, and agreed to hear the case in full in October 2019. It will be the first abortion-related case to be heard by President [[Donald Trump]]'s appointees to the Court, [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Bret Kavanaugh]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-to-review-ruling-on-louisiana-abortion-law/2019/10/04/85eaf2b0-e6ab-11e9-a6e8-8759c5c7f608_story.html | title = Supreme Court to review ruling on Louisiana abortion law | first= Robert | last= Barnes | date =  October 4, 2019 | accessdate = October 4, 2019 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}</ref>\n\n==Current legal status{{anchor|Current_legal_situation}}==\n\n===Federal legislation===\nSince 1995, led by congressional [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]], the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] have moved several times to pass measures banning the procedure of [[intact dilation and extraction]], commonly known as partial birth abortion. Such measures passed twice by wide margins, but [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] [[veto]]ed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions. Congressional supporters of the bill argue that a health exception would render the bill unenforceable, since the ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' decision defined \"health\" in vague terms, justifying any motive for obtaining an abortion. Congress was unsuccessful with subsequent attempts to override the vetoes.\n\nThe [[Born-Alive Infants Protection Act|Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002]] (\"BAIPA\") was enacted August 5, 2002 by an Act of Congress and signed into law by George W. Bush. It asserts the human rights of infants born after a failed attempt to induce abortion. A \"born-alive infant\" is specified as a \"person, human being, child, individual\". \"Born alive\" is defined as the complete expulsion of an infant at any stage of development that has a heartbeat, pulsation of the umbilical cord, breath, or voluntary muscle movement, no matter if the umbilical cord has been cut or if the expulsion of the infant was natural, induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion.\n\nOn October 2, 2003, with a vote of 281-142, the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] approved the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] to ban partial-birth abortion, with an exemption in cases of fatal threats to the woman. Through this legislation, a doctor could face up to two years in prison and civil lawsuits for performing such a procedure. A woman undergoing the procedure could not be prosecuted under the measure. On October 21, 2003, the [[United States Senate]] passed the bill by a vote of 64-34, with a number of Democrats joining in support. The bill was signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on November 5, 2003, but a federal judge blocked its enforcement in several states just a few hours after it became public law. The Supreme Court upheld the nationwide ban on the procedure in the case ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' on April 18, 2007, signaling a substantial change in the Court's approach to abortion law.<ref name=\"nyt-greenhouse\">{{cite news | first = Linda | last = Greenhouse | authorlink = Linda Greenhouse | work = The New York Times | title = Justices Back Ban on Method of Abortion | date = April 19, 2007 | accessdate = January 3, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/washington/19scotus.html}}</ref> The 5-4 ruling said the ''Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act'' does not conflict with previous decisions regarding abortion.\n\nThe current judicial interpretation of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] regarding abortion, following the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]'s 1973 landmark decision in ''Roe v. Wade'', and subsequent companion decisions, is that abortion is legal but may be restricted by the states to varying degrees. States have passed laws to restrict late-term abortions, require parental notification for minors, and mandate the disclosure of abortion risk information to patients prior to the procedure.<ref>[http://www.lawserver.com/abortion Interactive maps comparing U.S. abortion restrictions by state], LawServer</ref>\n\nThe official report of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, issued in 1983 after extensive hearings on the [[Human Life Amendment]] (proposed by Senators [[Orrin Hatch]] and [[Thomas Eagleton]]), stated that\n\n{{quote|Thus, the [Judiciary] Committee observes that no significant legal barriers of any kind whatsoever exist today in the United States for a mother to obtain an abortion for any reason during any stage of her pregnancy.<ref>Report, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, on Senate Joint Resolution 3, 98th Congress, 98-149, June 7, 1983, p. 6.</ref>}}\n\nOne aspect of the legal abortion regime now in place has been determining when the [[fetus]] is \"[[Fetal viability|viable]]\" outside the womb as a measure of when the \"life\" of the fetus is its own (and therefore subject to being protected by the state). In the majority opinion delivered by the court in ''Roe v. Wade'', viability was defined as \"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. Viability is usually placed at about [[Prenatal Development|seven months]] (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks\". When the court ruled in 1973, the then-current medical technology suggested that viability could occur as early as 24 weeks.

Nominees typically remain silent on the issue during their hearings, as the issue may come before them as judges.\n\nThe [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]], commonly known as \"[[Laci Peterson|Laci]] and Conner's Law\" was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush on April 1, 2004, allowing two charges to be filed against someone who kills a pregnant mother (one for the mother and one for the fetus). It specifically bans charges against the mother and/or doctor relating to abortion procedures. Nevertheless, it has generated much controversy among pro-abortion rights advocates who view it as a potential step in the direction of banning abortion.\n\nThe [[Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act]] is a [[United States Congress]] bill to ban late-term abortions nationwide after 20 weeks post-[[fertilization]] on the basis that the fetus is capable of feeling pain during an abortion at and after that point of pregnancy. The bill was first introduced in Congress in 2013. It successfully passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2013, 2015, and 2017, but has yet to pass the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Opponents of the bill reject the claims made by the bill's supporters regarding fetal development, and argue that such a restriction would endanger women's health.\n\n[[File:AbortionRestrictions2013.svg|thumb|This map demonstrates an increase in abortion restrictions and a simultaneous decrease in abortion access in the US in 2013.

This divergence also led to [[Christian Right]] organizations like [[Christian Voice (USA)|Christian Voice]], [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] and [[Moral Majority]] having an increasingly strong role in the Republican Party. This opposition has been extended under the Foreign Assistance Act: in 1973 [[Jesse Helms]] introduced an amendment banning the use of aid money to promote abortion overseas, and in 1984 the [[Mexico City Policy]] prohibited financial support to any overseas organization that performed or promoted abortions.
