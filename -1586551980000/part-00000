The race, for three-year-old [[Thoroughbred]] colts, geldings and fillies, was last run in 2005.\n\n==History==\nInaugurated at the [[Sheepshead Bay Race Track]] at [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend, New York]], it was held there until 1913. At that time, the race was the richest stakes for three-year-olds in the United States.\n\nIt was run as the Realization Stakes until 1899, when it was renamed to honor James G. K. Lawrence, president of the [[Coney Island Jockey Club]] (which owned the racetrack). Lawrence was also responsible for creating of the [[Belmont Futurity Stakes|Futurity Stakes]] in 1888.\n\nThe stakes were later run at [[Belmont Park]] on [[Long Island]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVUwAAAAIAAJ&q=lawrence+realization+stakes+1899&dq=lawrence+realization+stakes+1899&hl=en&ei=GrWATIu-JZGSswbR2e2nBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ]''Chicago Daily News Almanac and Yearbook'' vol. 47, p. 507. ''Chicago Daily News Co.'', 1931.</ref> as a [[Graded stakes race|Grade II]] race on the dirt. The race continued to be run there (except for the Belmont Park redevelopment period from 1962 to 1968) until it was removed from the calendar in 2005 by the [[New York Racing Association]] (NYRA) as a cost-cutting measure. For 70 years, the Lawrence Realization was one of the most prestigious annual events in the American [[horse racing]] calendar.\n\nOnly two horses contested the race in 1918, 1920, 1944, and 1946; however, due to the large number of entries in 1976 and 1985 it was run in two divisions.\n\nThe race was contested over several distances: \n* 1\u215d miles : 1889-1913, 1918-1969\n* 1\u00bd miles : 1916-1917, 1970-2004\n* 1\u215b miles : 2005\n\n==Records==\nOn September 4, 1920, [[Man o' War]] won the 1\u215d-mile Lawrence Realization by 100 lengths over the only other runner, Hoodwink. His time for the race was 2:40 4/5, which broke the world record for the distance by 1 3/5 seconds and was his fifth record-setting performance that year. The great [[Kelso (horse)|Kelso]] tied the record in 1960.\n\n===Records for distance===\n* At 1\u00bd miles : 2:25.94 - ''Parade Ground'' (1998)\n* At 1\u215d miles : 2:40.80 - ''Man o' War'' (1920)\n* At 1\u215d miles : 2:40.80 - ''Kelso''  (1960)\n\n===Most wins by a [[jockey]]===\n* 5 - [[Braulio Baeza]] (1961, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1972)\n* 5 - [[Eddie Arcaro]] (1935, 1939, 1952, 1959, 1960)\n\n===Most wins by a [[Horse trainer|trainer]]===\n* 8 - [[James E.

The race, for three-year-old [[Thoroughbred]] colts, geldings and fillies, was last run in 2005.\n\n==History==\nInaugurated at the [[Sheepshead Bay Race Track]] at [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend, New York]], it was held there until 1913. At that time, the race was the richest stakes for three-year-olds in the United States.\n\nIt was run as the Realization Stakes until 1899, when it was renamed to honor James G. K. Lawrence, president of the [[Coney Island Jockey Club]] (which owned the racetrack). Lawrence was also responsible for creating of the [[Belmont Futurity Stakes|Futurity Stakes]] in 1888.\n\nThe stakes were later run at [[Belmont Park]] on [[Long Island]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVUwAAAAIAAJ&q=lawrence+realization+stakes+1899&dq=lawrence+realization+stakes+1899&hl=en&ei=GrWATIu-JZGSswbR2e2nBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ]''Chicago Daily News Almanac and Yearbook'' vol. 47, p. 507. ''Chicago Daily News Co.'', 1931.</ref> as a [[Graded stakes race|Grade II]] race on the dirt. The race continued to be run there (except for the Belmont Park redevelopment period from 1962 to 1968) until it was removed from the calendar in 2005 by the [[New York Racing Association]] (NYRA) as a cost-cutting measure. For 70 years, the Lawrence Realization was one of the most prestigious annual events in the American [[horse racing]] calendar.\n\nOnly two horses contested the race in 1918, 1920, 1944, and 1946; however, due to the large number of entries in 1976 and 1985 it was run in two divisions.\n\nThe race was contested over several distances: \n* 1\u215d miles : 1889-1913, 1918-1969\n* 1\u00bd miles : 1916-1917, 1970-2004\n* 1\u215b miles : 2005\n\n==Records==\nOn September 4, 1920, [[Man o' War]] won the 1\u215d-mile Lawrence Realization by 100 lengths over the only other runner, Hoodwink. His time for the race was 2:40 4/5, which broke the world record for the distance by 1 3/5 seconds and was his fifth record-setting performance that year. The great [[Kelso (horse)|Kelso]] tied the record in 1960.\n\n===Records for distance===\n* At 1\u00bd miles : 2:25.94 - ''Parade Ground'' (1998)\n* At 1\u215d miles : 2:40.80 - ''Man o' War'' (1920)\n* At 1\u215d miles : 2:40.80 - ''Kelso''  (1960)\n\n===Most wins by a [[jockey]]===\n* 5 - [[Braulio Baeza]] (1961, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1972)\n* 5 - [[Eddie Arcaro]] (1935, 1939, 1952, 1959, 1960)\n\n===Most wins by a [[Horse trainer|trainer]]===\n* 8 - [[James E.

However, if Miss Spain is underage, a runner-up is sent to Miss Universe. Overall in these international pageants, Spain's success has been moderate with one Miss Universe title in [[Miss Universe 1974|1974]] and 3 Miss International titles in [[Miss International 1977|1977]], [[Miss International 1990|1990]] and [[Miss International 2008|2008]].\n\n===Miss Universe Spain and Miss World Spain: 2013-present===\nAfter the inactivity of Miss Spain contest, the company Be Beautiful Spain, S.L. was created by Guillermo Escobar Garc\u00eda, former worker of Miss Spain and who founded the contests Miss Spain Universe and Miss Spain World. In 2013, the pageant is separated into several pageants - like Miss World Spain and Miss Universe Spain. In the year 2018, after seven years of inactivity, the contest '''Miss Spain''' returns with Pedro Quesada as president and with [[Juncal Rivero]] as general director. The current national director for Spain at Miss Universe is Jorge Diez Vanila. The national directors for Spain at both Miss World and Miss International are Cres del Olmo and Daniel Montesdeoca.\n\n==Titleholders==\n::''The winner of Miss Espa\u00f1a represents her country at [[Miss Universe]]. On occasion, when the winner does not qualify (due to age) for either contest, a runner-up is sent. Sometimes, the winner can also compete at [[Miss World]] and [[Miss Europe]] if the winner will be available to compete by the Miss Espa\u00f1a Organization. However, Miss Espa\u00f1a Organization was claimed to bankrupt in 2012, and separated into several independent contests choosing the representatives in the International beauty pageants like Miss World Spain (Miss Espa\u00f1a Mundo) and Miss Universe Spain (Miss Espa\u00f1a Universo).''\n\n===1929-2011===\n{| class=\"sortable\" border=\"5\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0;

However, if Miss Spain is underage, a runner-up is sent to Miss Universe. Overall in these international pageants, Spain's success has been moderate with one Miss Universe title in [[Miss Universe 1974|1974]] and 3 Miss International titles in [[Miss International 1977|1977]], [[Miss International 1990|1990]] and [[Miss International 2008|2008]].\n\n===Miss Universe Spain and Miss World Spain: 2013-present===\nAfter the inactivity of Miss Spain contest, the company Be Beautiful Spain, S.L. was created by Guillermo Escobar Garc\u00eda, former worker of Miss Spain and who founded the contests Miss Spain Universe and Miss Spain World. In 2013, the pageant is separated into several pageants - like Miss World Spain and Miss Universe Spain. In the year 2018, after seven years of inactivity, the contest '''Miss Spain''' returns with Pedro Quesada as president and with [[Juncal Rivero]] as general director. The current national director for Spain at Miss Universe is Jorge Diez Vanila. The national directors for Spain at both Miss World and Miss International are Cres del Olmo and Daniel Montesdeoca.\n\n==Titleholders==\n::''The winner of Miss Espa\u00f1a represents her country at [[Miss Universe]]. On occasion, when the winner does not qualify (due to age) for either contest, a runner-up is sent. Sometimes, the winner can also compete at [[Miss World]] and [[Miss Europe]] if the winner will be available to compete by the Miss Espa\u00f1a Organization. However, Miss Espa\u00f1a Organization was claimed to bankrupt in 2012, and separated into several independent contests choosing the representatives in the International beauty pageants like Miss World Spain (Miss Espa\u00f1a Mundo) and Miss Universe Spain (Miss Espa\u00f1a Universo).''\n\n===1929-2011===\n{| class=\"sortable\" border=\"5\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0;

{"title_page": "Feminism in the United Kingdom", "text_new": "{{Feminism sidebar}}\nAs in other countries, '''feminism in the United Kingdom''' seeks to establish political, social, and economic equality for women. The history of feminism in Britain dates to the very beginnings of [[feminism]] itself, as many of the earliest feminist writers and activists\u2014such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Barbara Bodichon]], and [[Lydia Becker]]\u2014were British.\n\n==19th century==\n{{main|History of women in the United Kingdom#19th century}}\n[[File:+Ann Thornton Going Aloft.jpg|thumb|160px|''[[Anne Jane Thornton|Ann Thornton]] Going Aloft'', ''c.'' 1835]]\nThe advent of the [[Reformism|reformist]] age during the 19th century meant that those invisible minorities or marginalised majorities were to find a catalyst and a microcosm in such new tendencies of reform. [[Robert Owen]], while asking for \"social reorganisation\", was laying down the basis of a new reformational background. One of those movements that took advantage of such new spirit was the [[feminist movement]]. The stereotype of the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] gentle lady became unacceptable and even intolerable. The first organised movement for British women's suffrage was the [[Langham Place Circle]] of the 1850s, led by [[Barbara Bodichon]] (''n\u00e9e'' Leigh-Smith) and [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]]. They also campaigned for improved female rights in the law, employment, education, and marriage.\n\nProperty owning women and widows had been allowed to vote in some local elections, but that ended in 1835. The [[Chartist Movement]] of 1838 to 1857 was a large-scale demand for suffrage\u2014however it only gave suffrage to men over 21. In 1851 the [[Sheffield Female Political Association]] was founded and submitted an unsuccessful petition calling for women's suffrage to the House of Lords. This probably inspired British feminist [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] to write the pro-women's-suffrage ''[[The Enfranchisement of Women]]'' (1851).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/taylor_harriet.shtml|title=BBC - History - Historic Figures: Harriet Taylor (1807 - 1858)}}</ref><ref name=\"Harriet Taylor Mill 1807 - 1858\">[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html Harriet Taylor Mill (1807 - 1858)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070414184944/http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html |date=2007-04-14 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/awrm/doc15.htm|title=Harriet Taylor Mill, Enfranchisement of Women, 1851|website=womhist.alexanderstreet.com}}</ref> On June 7, 1866 a petition from 1,499 women calling for women's suffrage was presented to the Parliament, but it also did not succeed.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsehistory/2016/06/07/the-1866-womens-suffrage-petition/ |title=The 1866 women's suffrage petition &#124; LSE History |publisher=Blogs.lse.ac.uk |date=2016-06-12 |accessdate=2018-02-07}}</ref>\n\nUpper-class women could exert a little backstage political influence in high society. However, in divorce cases, rich women lost control of their children.\n\n===Careers===\nAmbitious middle-class women faced enormous challenges when they proposed entering suitable careers, such as nursing, teaching, law, and medicine, and the loftier their ambition, the greater the challenge. Physicians barred admission to the medical profession; there were a few opportunities for women lawyers, but none as clerics.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_500_506\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 500\u2013506 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref> White collar business opportunities outside family-owned shops were few until clerical positions opened in the 20th century.  [[Florence Nightingale]] demonstrated the necessity of professional nursing and warfare, and set up an educational system that tracked women into that field in the second half of the nineteenth century.  Teaching was not quite as easy to break into, but the low salaries were less of the barrier to the single woman than to the married man.  By the late 1860s a number of schools were preparing women for careers as governesses or teachers. The census reported in 1851 that 70,000 women in England and Wales were teachers, compared to the 170,000 who comprised three-fourths of all teachers in 1901.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_500\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | page = 500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Copelman | first = Dina | title = London's women teachers: gender, class and feminism, 1870-1930 | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780415867528 }}</ref> The great majority came from lower middle class origins.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Coppock | first = David A. | title = Respectability as a prerequisite of moral character: the social and occupational mobility of pupil teachers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries | journal = [[History of Education Quarterly|History of Education]] | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 165\u2013186 | doi = 10.1080/0046760970260203 | date = 1997 | ref = harv }}</ref> The National Union of Women Teachers (NUWT) originated in the early 20th century inside the male-controlled National Union of Teachers (NUT).

One route to entry was to go to the United States where there were suitable schools for women as early as 1850.  Britain was the last major country to train women physicians, so 80 to 90% of the British women came to America for their medical degrees.  Edinburgh University admitted a few women in 1869, then reversed itself in 1873, leaving a strong negative reaction among British medical educators.  The first separate school for women physicians opened in London in 1874 to a handful of students. Scotland was more open. Coeducation had to wait until the World War.<ref>{{citation | last = Bonner | first = Thomas Neville | contribution = The fight for coeducation in Britain | editor-last = Bonner | editor-first = Thomas Neville | title = To the ends of the earth: women's search for education in medicine | pages = 120\u2013137 | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780674893047 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century women had secured equality of status in most spheres \u2013 except of course for the vote and the holding of office.\n\n===Child custody ===\nBefore 1839 after divorce rich women lost control of their children as those children would continue in the family unit with the father, as head of the household, and who continued to be responsible for them. [[Caroline Norton]] was one such woman; her personal tragedy where she was denied access to her three sons after a divorce led her to a life of intense campaigning which successfully led to the passing of the [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]] and introduced the [[Tender years doctrine]] for child custody arrangement.<ref name=\"Wroath_Seven\">{{cite book | last = Wroath | first = John | title = Until they are seven: the origins of women's legal rights | publisher = Waterside Press | location = Winchester England | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781872870571 | url = https://archive.org/details/untiltheyareseve00wroa }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = L.

It required a very expensive private act of Parliament costing perhaps \u00a3200, of the sort only the richest could possibly afford. It was very difficult to secure divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, or cruelty.  The first key legislative victory came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857]]. It passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England. The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases.  The process was still quite expensive, at about \u00a340, but now became feasible for the middle class. A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a ''feme sole,'' with full control of her own civil rights.  Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace. The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]].<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Stone | editor-first = Lawrence | title = Road to divorce: England 1530-1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780198226512 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref>\n\n===Prostitution===\n{{main|Prostitution in the United Kingdom}}\nBullough argues that prostitution in 18th-century Britain was a convenience to men of all social statuses, and economic necessity for many poor women, and was tolerated by society.

Parliament in the 1860s in the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] (\"CD\") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The \"regulationist policy\" was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were  trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by [[Josephine Butler]] and the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]], Parliament repealed the acts in 1886 and ended legalised prostitution. Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free. The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand.

[[Emily Davison]], a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 [[Epsom Derby]] and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} As many protesters were imprisoned and [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|went on hunger-strike]], the Liberal government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.  Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement.  Women were thrilled and supportive of revolting in the streets; the membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and was mutually supportive.  However a system of publicity, Ensor argues, had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media.  The hunger strikes and force-feeding did that.  However the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics. They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson.  This went too far, as the overwhelming majority of suffragists pulled back and refused to follow because they could no longer defend the tactics.  Shey increasingly repudiated the suffragettes as an obstacle to achieving suffrage, saying the militant suffragettes  were now aiding the antis, and many historians agree.  Searle says the methods of the suffragettes did succeed in damaging the Liberal party but failed to advance the cause of woman suffrage.  When the Pankhursts decided to stop the militancy at the start of the war, and enthusiastically support the war effort, the movement split and their leadership role ended.  Suffrage did come four years later, but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ensor | first = Robert C.K. | title = England: 1870-1914 | pages = 389\u2013399 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | oclc = 24731395 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Searle | first = G.

Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganising effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = Martin D. | title = Politicians and the woman's vote 1914\u20131918 | journal = [[History (journal)|History]] | volume = 59 | issue = 197 | pages = 358\u2013374 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02222.x | jstor = 24409414 | date = October 1974 | ref = harv }}</ref> More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers.

It also lobbied at an international level, such as the [[League of Nations]], and continued its work till 1983. In retrospect both ideological groups were influential in advancing women's rights in their own way. Despite women being admitted to the House of Commons from 1918, Mackworth, a Viscountess in her own right, spent a lifetime fighting to take her seat in the House of Lords against bitter opposition, a battle which only achieved its goal in the year of her death (1958). This revealed the weaknesses of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act. Mackworth also founded [[Time and Tide (magazine)|''Time and Tide'']] which became the group's journal, and to which West, Virginia Woolf, [[Rose Macaulay]] and many others contributed. A number of other women's periodicals also appeared in the 1920s, including ''Woman and Home'', and ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', but whose content reflect very different aspirations. In 1925 Rebecca West wrote in ''Time and Tide'' something that reflected not only the movement's need to redefine itself post suffrage, but a continual need for re-examination of goals. \"When those of our army whose voices are inclined to coolly tell us that the day of sex-antagonism is over and henceforth we have only to advance hand in hand with the male, I do not believe it.\"<ref>Walters, Margaret (2005). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=PCwdyaLCbXoC&pg=PT116 Early 20th-century feminism]\".

Among other things, it created a public duty to promote equality on the ground of gender (The Equality Act 2006, section 84, inserting section 76A of the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], now found in section 1 of the [[Equality Act 2010]].)\n\nSince 2007, [[Harriet Harman]] has been Deputy Leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the UK's current opposition party.

This was, primarily, the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]], the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], the [[Race Relations Act 1976]], the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] and three major [[statutory instruments]] protecting against discrimination in employment on grounds of [[Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003|religion or belief]], [[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003|sexual orientation]] and [[Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006|age]]. It requires equal treatment in access to employment as well as private and public services, regardless of the protected characteristics of sex, age, [[disability]], [[sex reassignment therapy|gender reassignment]], marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, and [[sexual orientation]]. In the case of gender, there are special protections for pregnant women.

The women were then subjected to compulsory checks for venereal disease. If a woman was declared to be infected, she would be confined in what was known as a [[lock hospital]] until she recovered or her sentence finished.

countries, '''feminism in the United Kingdom''' seeks to establish political, social, and economic equality for women. The history of feminism in Britain dates to the very beginnings of [[feminism]] itself, as many of the earliest feminist writers and activists\u2014such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Barbara Bodichon]], and [[Lydia Becker]]\u2014were British.\n\n==19th century==\n{{main|History of women in the United Kingdom#19th century}}\n[[File:+Ann Thornton Going Aloft.jpg|thumb|160px|''[[Anne Jane Thornton|Ann Thornton]] Going Aloft'', ''c.'' 1835]]\nThe advent of the [[Reformism|reformist]] age during the 19th century meant that those invisible minorities or marginalised majorities were to find a catalyst and a microcosm in such new tendencies of reform. [[Robert Owen]], while asking for \"social reorganisation\", was laying down the basis of a new reformational background. One of those movements that took advantage of such new spirit was the [[feminist movement]]. The stereotype of the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] gentle lady became unacceptable and even intolerable. The first organised movement for British women's suffrage was the [[Langham Place Circle]] of the 1850s, led by [[Barbara Bodichon]] (''n\u00e9e'' Leigh-Smith) and [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]]. They also campaigned for improved female rights in the law, employment, education, and marriage.\n\nProperty owning women and widows had been allowed to vote in some local elections, but that ended in 1835. The [[Chartist Movement]] of 1838 to 1857 was a large-scale demand for suffrage\u2014however it only gave suffrage to men over 21. In 1851 the [[Sheffield Female Political Association]] was founded and submitted an unsuccessful petition calling for women's suffrage to the House of Lords. This probably inspired British feminist [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] to write the pro-women's-suffrage ''[[The Enfranchisement of Women]]'' (1851).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/taylor_harriet.shtml|title=BBC - History - Historic Figures: Harriet Taylor (1807 - 1858)}}</ref><ref name=\"Harriet Taylor Mill 1807 - 1858\">[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html Harriet Taylor Mill (1807 - 1858)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070414184944/http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html |date=2007-04-14 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/awrm/doc15.htm|title=Harriet Taylor Mill, Enfranchisement of Women, 1851|website=womhist.alexanderstreet.com}}</ref> On June 7, 1866 a petition from 1,499 women calling for women's suffrage was presented to the Parliament, but it also did not succeed.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsehistory/2016/06/07/the-1866-womens-suffrage-petition/ |title=The 1866 women's suffrage petition &#124; LSE History |publisher=Blogs.lse.ac.uk |date=2016-06-12 |accessdate=2018-02-07}}</ref>\n\nUpper-class women could exert a little backstage political influence in high society. However, in divorce cases, rich women lost control of their children.\n\n===Careers===\nAmbitious middle-class women faced enormous challenges when they proposed entering suitable careers, such as nursing, teaching, law, and medicine, and the loftier their ambition, the greater the challenge. Physicians barred admission to the medical profession; there were a few opportunities for women lawyers, but none as clerics.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_500_506\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 500\u2013506 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref> White collar business opportunities outside family-owned shops were few until clerical positions opened in the 20th century.  [[Florence Nightingale]] demonstrated the necessity of professional nursing and warfare, and set up an educational system that tracked women into that field in the second half of the nineteenth century.  Teaching was not quite as easy to break into, but the low salaries were less of the barrier to the single woman than to the married man.  By the late 1860s a number of schools were preparing women for careers as governesses or teachers. The census reported in 1851 that 70,000 women in England and Wales were teachers, compared to the 170,000 who comprised three-fourths of all teachers in 1901.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_500\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | page = 500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Copelman | first = Dina | title = London's women teachers: gender, class and feminism, 1870-1930 | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780415867528 }}</ref> The great majority came from lower middle class origins.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Coppock | first = David A. | title = Respectability as a prerequisite of moral character: the social and occupational mobility of pupil teachers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries | journal = [[History of Education Quarterly|History of Education]] | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 165\u2013186 | doi = 10.1080/0046760970260203 | date = 1997 | ref = harv }}</ref> The National Union of Women Teachers (NUWT) originated in the early 20th century inside the male-controlled National Union of Teachers (NUT).

One route to entry was to go to the United States where there were suitable schools for women as early as 1850.  Britain was the last major country to train women physicians, so 80 to 90% of the British women came to America for their medical degrees.  Edinburgh University admitted a few women in 1869, then reversed itself in 1873, leaving a strong negative reaction among British medical educators.  The first separate school for women physicians opened in London in 1874 to a handful of students. Scotland was more open.

The first key legislative victory came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857]]. It passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England. The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases.  The process was still quite expensive, at about \u00a340, but now became feasible for the middle class. A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a ''feme sole,'' with full control of her own civil rights.  Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace. The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]].<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Stone | editor-first = Lawrence | title = Road to divorce: England 1530-1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780198226512 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref>\n\n===Prostitution===\n{{main|Prostitution in the United Kingdom}}\nBullough argues that prostitution in 18th-century Britain was a convenience to men of all social statuses, and economic necessity for many poor women, and was tolerated by society.

Parliament in the 1860s in the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] (\"CD\") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The \"regulationist policy\" was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were  trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by [[Josephine Butler]] and the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]], Parliament repealed the acts in 1886 and ended legalised prostitution. Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free. The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand. The new moral code meant that respectable men dared not be caught.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_498\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 498\u2013500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Strachey | first1 = Ray | last2 = Strachey | first2 = Barbara | title = The cause: a short history of the women's movement in Great Britain | pages = 187\u2013222 | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780860680420 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Bartley | first = Paula | title = Prostitution: prevention and reform in England, 1860-1914 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780415214575 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = F.B. | title = The Contagious Diseases Acts reconsidered | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 197\u2013215 | doi = 10.1093/shm/3.2.197 | pmid = 11622578 | date = August 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n===Protection for rich and poor women===\nA series of four laws each called the [[Married Women's Property Act (disambiguation)|Married Women's Property Act]] passed Parliament from [[Married Women's Property Act 1870|1870]] to [[Married Women's Property Act 1893|1893]] that effectively removed the restrictions that kept wealthy married women from controlling their own property.

[[Emily Davison]], a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 [[Epsom Derby]] and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} As many protesters were imprisoned and [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|went on hunger-strike]], the Liberal government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.  Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement.  Women were thrilled and supportive of revolting in the streets; the membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and was mutually supportive.  However a system of publicity, Ensor argues, had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media.  The hunger strikes and force-feeding did that.  However the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics. They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson.  This went too far, as the overwhelming majority of suffragists pulled back and refused to follow because they could no longer defend the tactics.  Shey increasingly repudiated the suffragettes as an obstacle to achieving suffrage, saying the militant suffragettes  were now aiding the antis, and many historians agree.  Searle says the methods of the suffragettes did succeed in damaging the Liberal party but failed to advance the cause of woman suffrage.  When the Pankhursts decided to stop the militancy at the start of the war, and enthusiastically support the war effort, the movement split and their leadership role ended.  Suffrage did come four years later, but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ensor | first = Robert C.K. | title = England: 1870-1914 | pages = 389\u2013399 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | oclc = 24731395 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Searle | first = G.

Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganising effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = Martin D. | title = Politicians and the woman's vote 1914\u20131918 | journal = [[History (journal)|History]] | volume = 59 | issue = 197 | pages = 358\u2013374 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02222.x | jstor = 24409414 | date = October 1974 | ref = harv }}</ref> More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers.

In retrospect both ideological groups were influential in advancing women's rights in their own way. Despite women being admitted to the House of Commons from 1918, Mackworth, a Viscountess in her own right, spent a lifetime fighting to take her seat in the House of Lords against bitter opposition, a battle which only achieved its goal in the year of her death (1958). This revealed the weaknesses of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act. Mackworth also founded [[Time and Tide (magazine)|''Time and Tide'']] which became the group's journal, and to which West, Virginia Woolf, [[Rose Macaulay]] and many others contributed. A number of other women's periodicals also appeared in the 1920s, including ''Woman and Home'', and ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', but whose content reflect very different aspirations.

This was, primarily, the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]], the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], the [[Race Relations Act 1976]], the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] and three major [[statutory instruments]] protecting against discrimination in employment on grounds of [[Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003|religion or belief]], [[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003|sexual orientation]] and [[Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006|age]]. It requires equal treatment in access to employment as well as private and public services, regardless of the protected characteristics of sex, age, [[disability]], [[sex reassignment therapy|gender reassignment]], marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, and [[sexual orientation]].
