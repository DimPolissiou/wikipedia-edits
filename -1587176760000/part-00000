(However, schools will have the option to conduct a census if they wish.) A randomly selected sample of students (undergraduates and graduates) allows the study to make scientifically based inferences to the population as a whole, helps focus finite research resources on successfully contacting and encouraging the participation of the broadest group of students, and reduces survey burden on an often over-surveyed population.\n\nThe NCCS will request sample data from university registrars (i.e. gender, race/ethnicity, year in school, on/off campus residence) in addition to contact information to allow for nonresponse analyses to be conducted. If deemed appropriate, the NCCS may generate nonresponse bias weights for the final analytic data file.\n\nThe NCCS will be implemented as a web-based, mobile-optimized survey, to ensure the data collected is of highest quality. Logical branching and filters will be used to tailor the questionnaire appropriately for each individual. Data collection will include at least four email contacts, and may include mailed prenotification letters, telephone calls, and in-person visits (depending on the service level selected). Data will be collected between January and April, 2016.\n\n=== Service Levels ===\nThe NCCS has a three-tiered service structure, designed to meet the specific needs of the local campus.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !!

To offer courses leading to the Nigeria Certificate in Education through a three-year academic and professional course which, on successful completion, candidates qualify as teachers in primary schools and secondary and teachers training colleges.\n\n2. To act as a centre for research into the various areas of educational theory and practice;\n\n3. To mount from time to time in-service vacation courses for serving teachers.<ref>http://www.afdevinfo.com/htmlreports/org/org_17043.html</ref><ref>http://www.coeakwanga.edu.ng/about.htm</ref>\n\nThe Provost of the institution is Rev(Dr) Musa Bawa who took over responsibilities of the college in 1998. He handed over to Alh. Mukhtar Isa Waya in 2006. There was an E-revolution during his tenure, which saw the introduction of an e-library in the school in 2007\u20132009.  <ref>http://nigerianstudy.blogspot.com/2009/11/directory-of-nigerian-colleges-of.html</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{coord missing|Nigeria}}\n\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Nigeria]]\n[[Category:Nasarawa State]]\n\n[http://huntcabal.com Education Nigeria]\n\n{{Nigeria-university-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasarawa_State_College_of_Education,_Akwanga"}

[[Correspondence chess]] has been played by mail for centuries. ''[[Diplomacy (board game)|Diplomacy]]'' has been played by mail since 1963, introducing a multi-player aspect to PBM games.<ref name=Babcock13>[[#Bab13|Babcock 2013]]. p. 16.</ref> [[Flying Buffalo Inc]] pioneered the first commercially available PBM game in 1970. A small number of PBM companies followed in the 1970s, with an explosion of hundreds of startup PBM companies in the 1980s at the peak of PBM gaming popularity, many of them small hobby companies\u2014more than 90 percent of which eventually folded. A number of independent PBM magazines also started in the 1980s, including ''[[Flagship magazine]]'', ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''. These magazines eventually went out of print, replaced in the 21st century by the online PBM journal ''[[Suspense and Decision]]''.\n\nPlay-by-mail games have a number of advantages and disadvantages related to other gaming genres. PBM games allow plenty of time\u2014sometimes days or weeks\u2014to consider moves or turns and players never run out of opponents to face. Additionally, the complexity of PBM games can be far beyond that allowed by a board game in an afternoon, and pits players against live opponents in these conditions, a challenge some players enjoy. Some games allow the number of opponents or teams in the dozens, even as high as fifty. PBM games also allow gamers to interact with others globally. And games with low turn costs compare well with expensive board or video games. Some drawbacks include the price for some PBM games with high setup and/or turn costs, and the lack of ability for face-to-face roleplaying. Additionally, for some players, some games can be overly complex, and delays in turn processing can be a negative.\n\nPlay-by-mail games are multifaceted. In their earliest form they involved two players alternatively sending moves directly to each other by postal mail, such as in correspondence chess. Multi-player games, such as ''Diplomacy'' or more complex games available today, involve a [[game master]] who receives, processes, and adjudicates turn results for players. These games also introduce the element of [[diplomacy]] in which participants can discuss gameplay with each other, strategize, and form [[alliances]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, turn results were sometimes adjudicated completely by humans. Over time, partial or complete turn adjudication by computer became the norm. Games also involve open and closed end variants. Open ended games do not end and players can develop their positions to the fullest extent possible, whereas in closed end games, players typically pursue a set of victory conditions until game conclusion. Finally, PBM games enable players to explore a diverse array of roles, from characters in fantasy or medieval settings, space operas, inner city gangs, or even more unusual ones such as assuming the role of microorganisms or monsters.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using [[postal mail]]. [[Chess]] is the oldest example of this type. It has been played for hundreds of years in various countries by mail. In this two player game, players send moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later. ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' is an example of this type in which a central [[game master]] manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. ''Diplomacy'' was first played by mail in 1963.<ref name=Babcock13/> In the early 1970s, in the United States, [[Rick Loomis]], of [[Flying Buffalo Inc]], began a number of multi-player play-by-mail games;<ref>[[#Loo13|Loomis 2013]]. p. 38.</ref> this included games such as ''[[Nuclear Destruction (play-by-mail)|Nuclear Destruction]]'', which launched in 1970.<ref>[[#Fly20|Flying Buffalo 2020]].</ref>\n\nThis began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as [[Battleplan (play-by-mail game)|''Battleplan'']], ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'', ''[[Starweb]]'', and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.<ref name=Townsend88a>[[#Tow88|Townsend 1988]]. p. 20.</ref> For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until [[Schubel & Son]] entered the field in \"roughly\" 1976 with the human-moderated ''[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]]'' game.<ref name=Townsend88a/> Schubel & Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay additional fees for additional options or special actions outside of the rules. This provided players with larger bankrolls the advantage or the ability to abuse game systems.<ref name=Townsend88a/>\n\nThe next \"big entrance\" was [[Superior Simulations]] with its game ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' in 1978.<ref name=Townsend88a/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that it was \"the most complex game system on Earth\" with some large position turn results 1,000 pages in length.<ref name=Townsend88a/> By 1980, the PBM field was growing but still nascent: there were still only two sizable commercial PBM companies, and only a few small ones.<ref name=Popo90>[[#Pop90|Popolizio, Leblanc, and Popolizio 1990]]. p. 8.</ref> The most popular games of 1980 were ''Starweb'' and ''Tribes of Crane''.<ref name=Popo90/>\n\nSome players, unhappy with their experiences with Schubel & Son and Superior Simulations, launched their own company\u2014Adventures by Mail\u2014with game, ''[[Beyond the Stellar Empire (play-by-mail game)|''Beyond the Stellar Empire'']]'', which became \"immensely popular\".<ref name=Townsend88a/> In this same way, many people have launched PBM companies, trying their hand at finding the right mix of action and strategy for the gaming audience of the period. According to Jim Townsend: <blockquote>In the late 70's and all of the 80's, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed. Although PBM is an easy industry to get into, staying in business is another thing entirely. Literally hundreds of PBM companies have come and gone, most of them taking the money of would-be-customers with them.<ref name=Townsend88a/></blockquote>\n\nTownsend emphasized the risks for the PBM industry in that \"The new PBM company has such a small chance of surviving that no insurance company would write a policy to cover them. Skydivers are a better risk.\"<ref>[[#Tow89|Townsend 1989]]. p. 55.</ref> By the late 1980s, of the more than one hundred play-by-mail companies operating, the majority were hobbies\u2013not run as businesses to make money.<ref name=Townsend12>[[#Tow12|Townsend 1988]]. p. 19.</ref> Jim Townsend estimated that, in 1988, there were about a dozen profitable PBM companies in the United States\u2014with an additional few in the [[United Kingdom]] and the same in [[Australia]].<ref name=Townsend12/>\n\nThe proliferation of PBM companies in the 1980s supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry such as the relatively short-lived ''[[The Nuts & Bolts of PBM]]'' and ''[[Gaming Universal]]''. The PBM genre's \"two preeminent magazines\" of the period were [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''.<ref>[[#Pad93|Paduch 1993]]. p. RC21.</ref>\n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games. But with the shift to the digital age has come new opportunities as well. PBM companies have introduced play-by-email (PBeM) options or games that are run in a turn-based fashion by email only.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the momentum from the 1980s. In 1993, ''Flagship'' magazine listed 185 active play-by-mail games.<ref>[[#Pro93|Procter 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> However, over time, the play-by-mail industry has gradually declined.\n\nIn 1998, ''Paper Mayhem'' magazine ceased publication suddenly after the unexpected death of its longtime editor in chief, David Webber.<ref>[[#Mui13|Muir 2013]]. p. 14.</ref> The last of the play-by-mail magazines started in the 1980s, ''Flagship'', went out of print in 2010. The number of remaining play-by-mail publications is relatively small\u2014mostly newsletters associated with play-by-mail companies, although ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'' remains as an independent online journal for play-by-mail gamers in the 21st century.<ref>[[#Sus20|Suspense & Decision 2020]].</ref>\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages of PBM gaming==\nJudith Proctor noted that play-by-mail games have a number of advantages. These include (1) plenty of time\u2014potentially days\u2014to plan a move, (2) never lacking players to face who have \"new tactics and ideas\", (3) the ability to play an \"incredibly complex\" game against live opponents, (4) meeting diverse gamers from far-away locations, and (5) relatively low costs.<ref>[[#Pro93a|Procter 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> Andrew Greenberg also pointed to the number of players possible in a multi-player game (\"as many as fifty teams\"), comparing it to his past failure at once trying to host an eleven-player [[Dungeons and Dragons]] Game.<ref name=Green93>[[#Gre93|Greenberg 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> \n\nGreenberg identified a number of drawbacks for play-by-mail games. He stated that the \"most obvious\" was the cost, because most games require a setup cost and a fee per turn, and some games can become expensive.<ref name=Green93/> Another drawback is the lack of face-to-face roleplaying inherent in play-by-mail games.<<ref name=Green93/> Finally, game complexity in some cases and occasional delays in turn processing can also be negatives in the genre.<ref name=Green93/>\n\n==Description==\nIn 1993, ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''\u2014a magazine for play-by-mail gamers\u2014described play-by-mail games thusly: <blockquote>PBM Games vary in the size of the games, turn around time, length of time a game lasts, and prices. An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=MayhemFeb93>[[#Fro93|Paper Mayhem Jan/Feb 1993]]. p. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out a turn sheet for a game and mail it back to the gaming company.<ref name=MayhemFeb93/> The company processes the turns and sends back turns sheets to the players so they can make subsequent moves.<ref name=MayhemFeb93/>\n\nR. Danard further separates a typical PBM turn into four parts. First, the company informs players on the results of the last turn. Next players conduct diplomatic activities, if desired. Then, they send their next turn sheets to the Game Master. Finally, the turn sheets are processed and the cycle is repeated. This continues until the game or a player is done.<ref>[[#Dan20|danard.net 2020]].</ref>\n\n===Diplomacy===\nAccording to ''Paper Mayhem'' assistant editor Jim Townsend, <blockquote>The most important aspect of PBM games is the diplomacy. If you don't communicate with the other players you will be labeled a \"loner,\" \"mute,\" or just plain \"dead meat.\" You must talk with the others to survive.<ref>[[#Tow87|Townsend 1987]]. p. 29.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Player roles===\nPlay-by-mail games provide a wide array of possible [[Role-playing game|roles to play]], from pirates to space characters to \"previously unknown creatures\".<ref name=Loth42>[[#Lot86|John Kevin Loth III 1986]]. p. 42.</ref> In the game ''[[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|Monster Island]]'', players assume the role of a monster which explores a massive island.<ref>[[#Hel93|Helzer 1993]]. p. 12.</ref> And the title of the PBM game ''You're An Amoeba, GO!'' indicates an unusual role as players struggle \"in a 3D pool of primordial ooze [directing] the evolution of a legion of micro-organisms\".<ref>[[#Pap94|Paper Mayhem 1994]]. p. 42.</ref> Loth advises that closer identification with a role increases enjoyment, but a higher importance of this aspect requires more time searching for the right PBM game.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n===Closed versus open ended===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth III, \"In theory, an open ended game lasts forever\" and there is no \"ultimate goal\" or way to win the game.<ref name=Loth42/> In open ended games, the designer has provided a system that enables players to develop with no upper limit. A drawback of this type is that mature games have \"factions of significant power and knowledge\" that can pose an unmanageable problem for the beginner\u2014although some may see this situation as a challenge of sorts.<ref name=Loth42/> Examples of open ended games are ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'',<ref>[[#Tow87a|Townsend 1987]]. p. 24.</ref> [[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|''Monster Island'']],<ref>[[#DuB97|DuBois 1997]]. p. 4.</ref> and ''SuperNova: Rise of the Empire''.<ref>[[#Sus19|Suspense & Decision 2019]]. pp. 35\u201340.</ref> \n\nLoth states that most players in closed end games start equally and the games are \"faster paced, usually more intense...presenting frequent player confrontation; [and] the game terminates when a player or alliance of players has achieved specific conditions or eliminated all opposition\".<ref name=Loth42/> Examples of closed end games are ''[[Hyborian War]]'', ''[[It's a Crime (play-by-mail game)|It's a Crime]]'', and ''[[Starweb]]''.\n\n===Computer versus human moderated===\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail gaming companies began leveraging computers to moderate games. To some degree this was an economic decision, as computers allowed the processing of more turns than humans, but with less of a human touch in the prose of a turn result. According to John Kevin Loth III, 100 percent computer moderated games would also kill a player's \"character or empire\" emotionlessly, regardless of effort invested.<ref name=Loth42/> Alternatively, Loth noted that those preferring exquisite pages of prose would gravitate toward 100 percent human moderation.<ref name=Loth42/> Loth provided ''Beyond the Quadra Zone'' and ''Earthwood'' as popular computer moderated examples in 1986 and ''Silverdawn'' and ''Sword Lords'' as 100 percent human moderated examples of the period.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n===Complexity===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth, \"Novices should appreciate that some games are best played by veterans.\"<ref name=Loth42/> He noted in 1986 that Midguard was a \"very complex game\" with a 100-page instruction manual and \"255 possible line entries\".<ref name=Loth42/><ref name=Townsend88a/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' was \"the most complex game system on Earth\".<ref name=Townsend88a/> Other games, like Galactic Prisoners began simply and gradually increased in complexity.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n==Cost and turn processing time==\nLoth noted that, in 1986, $3\u20135 per turn was the most prevalent cost.<ref name=Loth43>[[#Lot86a|John Kevin Loth III 1986]]. p. 43.</ref> At the time, some games were free, while some costed as much as $100 per turn.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\nPlay-by-mail magazine ''Paper Mayhem'' stated that the average turn processing time in 1987 was two weeks, and Loth noted that this was also the most popular.<ref>[[#Pap87d|Paper Mayhem Sep/Oct 1987]]. p. 1.</ref><ref name=Loth43/> In 1986, play-by-email was a nascent service only being offered by the largest PBM companies.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\n==Information sources==\nJohn Kevin Loth stated that, in 1986, the \"three major information sources in PBM\" were ''Paper Mayhem'', ''Flagship Magazine'', and the [[Play By Mail Association]].<ref name=Loth43/> Minor sources included magazines such as \"''[[Different Worlds]]'', [[Dragon (magazine)|''Dragon'']], ''[[Game New]]'', [[Imagine (game magazine)|''Imagine'']], and [[White Dwarf (magazine)|''White Dwarf'']]\".<ref name=Loth43/> Game and company-specific publications also provided significant information, as well as \"alliances, associations, and senior players\".<ref name=Loth43/> ''[[White Wolf Magazine]]'' also began a regular PBM column beginning in issue #11 as well as publishing an annual PBM issue beginning with issue #16.<ref>[[#Whi88|White Wolf 1988]]. p. 2.</ref><ref>[[#Whi89|White Wolf 1989]]. p. 1.</ref>\n\n''Flagship Magazine'' ran into the 21st Century, but ceased publication in 2010. In November 2013, an online journal for play-by-mail games, [[Suspense and Decision]], began publication.<ref>[[#Sus13|Suspense & Decision 2013]].</ref> \n\n==See also==\n* [[List of play-by-mail games]]\n* [[Play-by-post role-playing game]]\n* [[Turn-based]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite magazine |last= Babcock|first= Chris  |date= December 2013|title= Diplomacy|url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |magazine= Suspense and Decision|location= |publisher= | issue = 2|pages= 16|accessdate= March 20, 2020|ref=Bab13}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last= DuBois |first= Steven |date=January\u2013February 1997 |title= Monster Island: A Review|magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=82|page= 4 |ref= DuB97}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last= Greenberg|first= Andrew |date=May\u2013June 1993 |title= PBM Corner: A Beginning in Play-By-Mail; Is it Worth It? |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]] |number=36|page= 51 |ref= Gre93}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last= Helzer|first= Herb |date= January\u2013February 1993 |title= Monster Island: Just One Destination for PBM Company |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=58|page= 12 |ref= Hel93}}\n* {{cite magazine |last= Loomis|first= Rick  |date= December 2013|title= Letter from Rick Loomis to the Play By Mail/Email/Web/Turn Based Games Community|url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |magazine= Suspense and Decision|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association| issue = 2|page= 38|accessdate= March 20, 2020|ref=Loo13}}\n* {{Cite magazine |first= Rick|last= Loomis|date=May 1999 |title= The History of Play-by-Mail and Flying Buffalo |magazine= Flying Buffalo Quarterly |number=79|pages= 2\u20135 |url=http://flyingbuffalo.com/download/fbq79.pdf|accessdate= April 17, 2020|ref= Loo99}} \n* {{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth III|date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 42 |ref= Lot86}}\n* {{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth III|date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 43 |ref= Lot86a}}\n* {{cite magazine |last= Muir|first= Shannon|date= December 2013|title= Using Play By Mail in a Novel's Plot: The Story Behind for the Love of Airagos|url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue-5-Suspense&Decision.pdf|dead-url= |magazine= Suspense and Decision||issue= 5 |publisher= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= February 15, 2020|ref= Mui13}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/nucdest.htm|title= Nuclear Destruction|author= |date= |work= Flying Buffalo, Inc|publisher= Flying Buffalo, Inc|accessdate= March 27, 2020|ref=Fly20}}\n* {{cite news |last= Paduch|first= Sally|date= June 27, 1993 |title= Email Brings Immediacy to Play-By-Mail Games|url= |work= New York Times|location= |page= RC21|access-date= |ref= Pad93}}\n* {{cite magazine |last1= Popolizio|first1= Mike |last2= LeBlanc|first2= Liz |last3= Popolizio|first3= Marti |date= January\u2013February 1990|title= Revamping a Classic!

[[Correspondence chess]] has been played by mail for centuries. ''[[Diplomacy (board game)|Diplomacy]]'' has been played by mail since 1963, introducing a multi-player aspect to PBM games.<ref name=Babcock13>[[#Bab13|Babcock 2013]]. p. 16.</ref> [[Flying Buffalo Inc]] pioneered the first commercially available PBM game in 1970. A small number of PBM companies followed in the 1970s, with an explosion of hundreds of startup PBM companies in the 1980s at the peak of PBM gaming popularity, many of them small hobby companies\u2014more than 90 percent of which eventually folded. A number of independent PBM magazines also started in the 1980s, including ''[[Flagship magazine]]'', ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''. These magazines eventually went out of print, replaced in the 21st century by the online PBM journal ''[[Suspense and Decision]]''.\n\nPlay-by-mail games have a number of advantages and disadvantages related to other gaming genres. PBM games allow plenty of time\u2014sometimes days or weeks\u2014to consider moves or turns and players never run out of opponents to face. Additionally, the complexity of PBM games can be far beyond that allowed by a board game in an afternoon, and pits players against live opponents in these conditions, a challenge some players enjoy. Some games allow the number of opponents or teams in the dozens, even as high as fifty. PBM games also allow gamers to interact with others globally. And games with low turn costs compare well with expensive board or video games. Some drawbacks include the price for some PBM games with high setup and/or turn costs, and the lack of ability for face-to-face roleplaying. Additionally, for some players, some games can be overly complex, and delays in turn processing can be a negative.\n\nPlay-by-mail games are multifaceted. In their earliest form they involved two players alternatively sending moves directly to each other by postal mail, such as in correspondence chess. Multi-player games, such as ''Diplomacy'' or more complex games available today, involve a [[game master]] who receives, processes, and adjudicates turn results for players. These games also introduce the element of [[diplomacy]] in which participants can discuss gameplay with each other, strategize, and form [[alliances]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, turn results were sometimes adjudicated completely by humans. Over time, partial or complete turn adjudication by computer became the norm. Games also involve open and closed end variants. Open ended games do not end and players can develop their positions to the fullest extent possible, whereas in closed end games, players typically pursue a set of victory conditions until game conclusion. Finally, PBM games enable players to explore a diverse array of roles, from characters in fantasy or medieval settings, space operas, inner city gangs, or even more unusual ones such as assuming the role of microorganisms or monsters.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using [[postal mail]]. [[Chess]] is the oldest example of this type. It has been played for hundreds of years in various countries by mail. In this two player game, players send moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later. ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' is an example of this type in which a central [[game master]] manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. ''Diplomacy'' was first played by mail in 1963.<ref name=Babcock13/> In the early 1970s, in the United States, [[Rick Loomis]], of [[Flying Buffalo Inc]], began a number of multi-player play-by-mail games;<ref>[[#Loo13|Loomis 2013]]. p. 38.</ref> this included games such as ''[[Nuclear Destruction (play-by-mail)|Nuclear Destruction]]'', which launched in 1970.<ref>[[#Fly20|Flying Buffalo 2020]].</ref>\n\nThis began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as [[Battleplan (play-by-mail game)|''Battleplan'']], ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'', ''[[Starweb]]'', and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.<ref name=Townsend88a>[[#Tow88|Townsend 1988]]. p. 20.</ref> For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until [[Schubel & Son]] entered the field in \"roughly\" 1976 with the human-moderated ''[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]]'' game.<ref name=Townsend88a/> Schubel & Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay additional fees for additional options or special actions outside of the rules. This provided players with larger bankrolls the advantage or the ability to abuse game systems.<ref name=Townsend88a/>\n\nThe next \"big entrance\" was [[Superior Simulations]] with its game ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' in 1978.<ref name=Townsend88a/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that it was \"the most complex game system on Earth\" with some large position turn results 1,000 pages in length.<ref name=Townsend88a/> By 1980, the PBM field was growing but still nascent: there were still only two sizable commercial PBM companies, and only a few small ones.<ref name=Popo90>[[#Pop90|Popolizio, Leblanc, and Popolizio 1990]]. p. 8.</ref> The most popular games of 1980 were ''Starweb'' and ''Tribes of Crane''.<ref name=Popo90/>\n\nSome players, unhappy with their experiences with Schubel & Son and Superior Simulations, launched their own company\u2014Adventures by Mail\u2014with game, ''[[Beyond the Stellar Empire (play-by-mail game)|''Beyond the Stellar Empire'']]'', which became \"immensely popular\".<ref name=Townsend88a/> In this same way, many people have launched PBM companies, trying their hand at finding the right mix of action and strategy for the gaming audience of the period. According to Jim Townsend: <blockquote>In the late 70's and all of the 80's, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed. Although PBM is an easy industry to get into, staying in business is another thing entirely. Literally hundreds of PBM companies have come and gone, most of them taking the money of would-be-customers with them.<ref name=Townsend88a/></blockquote>\n\nTownsend emphasized the risks for the PBM industry in that \"The new PBM company has such a small chance of surviving that no insurance company would write a policy to cover them. Skydivers are a better risk.\"<ref>[[#Tow89|Townsend 1989]]. p. 55.</ref> By the late 1980s, of the more than one hundred play-by-mail companies operating, the majority were hobbies\u2013not run as businesses to make money.<ref name=Townsend12>[[#Tow12|Townsend 1988]]. p. 19.</ref> Jim Townsend estimated that, in 1988, there were about a dozen profitable PBM companies in the United States\u2014with an additional few in the [[United Kingdom]] and the same in [[Australia]].<ref name=Townsend12/>\n\nThe proliferation of PBM companies in the 1980s supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry such as the relatively short-lived ''[[The Nuts & Bolts of PBM]]'' and ''[[Gaming Universal]]''. The PBM genre's \"two preeminent magazines\" of the period were [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''.<ref>[[#Pad93|Paduch 1993]]. p. RC21.</ref>\n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games. But with the shift to the digital age has come new opportunities as well. PBM companies have introduced play-by-email (PBeM) options or games that are run in a turn-based fashion by email only.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the momentum from the 1980s. In 1993, ''Flagship'' magazine listed 185 active play-by-mail games.<ref>[[#Pro93|Procter 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> However, over time, the play-by-mail industry has gradually declined.\n\nIn 1998, ''Paper Mayhem'' magazine ceased publication suddenly after the unexpected death of its longtime editor in chief, David Webber.<ref>[[#Mui13|Muir 2013]]. p. 14.</ref> The last of the play-by-mail magazines started in the 1980s, ''Flagship'', went out of print in 2010. The number of remaining play-by-mail publications is relatively small\u2014mostly newsletters associated with play-by-mail companies, although ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'' remains as an independent online journal for play-by-mail gamers in the 21st century.<ref>[[#Sus20|Suspense & Decision 2020]].</ref>\n\n==Advantages and disadvantages of PBM gaming==\nJudith Proctor noted that play-by-mail games have a number of advantages. These include (1) plenty of time\u2014potentially days\u2014to plan a move, (2) never lacking players to face who have \"new tactics and ideas\", (3) the ability to play an \"incredibly complex\" game against live opponents, (4) meeting diverse gamers from far-away locations, and (5) relatively low costs.<ref>[[#Pro93a|Procter 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> Andrew Greenberg also pointed to the number of players possible in a multi-player game (\"as many as fifty teams\"), comparing it to his past failure at once trying to host an eleven-player [[Dungeons and Dragons]] Game.<ref name=Green93>[[#Gre93|Greenberg 1993]]. p. 51.</ref> \n\nGreenberg identified a number of drawbacks for play-by-mail games. He stated that the \"most obvious\" was the cost, because most games require a setup cost and a fee per turn, and some games can become expensive.<ref name=Green93/> Another drawback is the lack of face-to-face roleplaying inherent in play-by-mail games.<<ref name=Green93/> Finally, game complexity in some cases and occasional delays in turn processing can also be negatives in the genre.<ref name=Green93/>\n\n==Description==\nIn 1993, ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''\u2014a magazine for play-by-mail gamers\u2014described play-by-mail games thusly: <blockquote>PBM Games vary in the size of the games, turn around time, length of time a game lasts, and prices. An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=MayhemFeb93>[[#Fro93|Paper Mayhem Jan/Feb 1993]]. p. 1.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out a turn sheet for a game and mail it back to the gaming company.<ref name=MayhemFeb93/> The company processes the turns and sends back turns sheets to the players so they can make subsequent moves.<ref name=MayhemFeb93/>\n\nR. Danard further separates a typical PBM turn into four parts. First, the company informs players on the results of the last turn. Next players conduct diplomatic activities, if desired. Then, they send their next turn sheets to the Game Master. Finally, the turn sheets are processed and the cycle is repeated. This continues until the game or a player is done.<ref>[[#Dan20|danard.net 2020]].</ref>\n\n===Diplomacy===\nAccording to ''Paper Mayhem'' assistant editor Jim Townsend, <blockquote>The most important aspect of PBM games is the diplomacy. If you don't communicate with the other players you will be labeled a \"loner,\" \"mute,\" or just plain \"dead meat.\" You must talk with the others to survive.<ref>[[#Tow87|Townsend 1987]]. p. 29.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Player roles===\nPlay-by-mail games provide a wide array of possible [[Role-playing game|roles to play]], from pirates to space characters to \"previously unknown creatures\".<ref name=Loth42>[[#Lot86|John Kevin Loth III 1986]]. p. 42.</ref> In the game ''[[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|Monster Island]]'', players assume the role of a monster which explores a massive island.<ref>[[#Hel93|Helzer 1993]]. p. 12.</ref> And the title of the PBM game ''You're An Amoeba, GO!'' indicates an unusual role as players struggle \"in a 3D pool of primordial ooze [directing] the evolution of a legion of micro-organisms\".<ref>[[#Pap94|Paper Mayhem 1994]]. p. 42.</ref> Loth advises that closer identification with a role increases enjoyment, but a higher importance of this aspect requires more time searching for the right PBM game.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n===Closed versus open ended===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth III, \"In theory, an open ended game lasts forever\" and there is no \"ultimate goal\" or way to win the game.<ref name=Loth42/> In open ended games, the designer has provided a system that enables players to develop with no upper limit. A drawback of this type is that mature games have \"factions of significant power and knowledge\" that can pose an unmanageable problem for the beginner\u2014although some may see this situation as a challenge of sorts.<ref name=Loth42/> Examples of open ended games are ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'',<ref>[[#Tow87a|Townsend 1987]]. p. 24.</ref> [[Monster Island (play-by-mail game)|''Monster Island'']],<ref>[[#DuB97|DuBois 1997]]. p. 4.</ref> and ''SuperNova: Rise of the Empire''.<ref>[[#Sus19|Suspense & Decision 2019]]. pp. 35\u201340.</ref> \n\nLoth states that most players in closed end games start equally and the games are \"faster paced, usually more intense...presenting frequent player confrontation; [and] the game terminates when a player or alliance of players has achieved specific conditions or eliminated all opposition\".<ref name=Loth42/> Examples of closed end games are ''[[Hyborian War]]'', ''[[It's a Crime (play-by-mail game)|It's a Crime]]'', and ''[[Starweb]]''.\n\n===Computer versus human moderated===\nIn the 1980s, play-by-mail gaming companies began leveraging computers to moderate games. To some degree this was an economic decision, as computers allowed the processing of more turns than humans, but with less of a human touch in the prose of a turn result. According to John Kevin Loth III, 100 percent computer moderated games would also kill a player's \"character or empire\" emotionlessly, regardless of effort invested.<ref name=Loth42/> Alternatively, Loth noted that those preferring exquisite pages of prose would gravitate toward 100 percent human moderation.<ref name=Loth42/> Loth provided ''Beyond the Quadra Zone'' and ''Earthwood'' as popular computer moderated examples in 1986 and ''Silverdawn'' and ''Sword Lords'' as 100 percent human moderated examples of the period.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n===Complexity===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth, \"Novices should appreciate that some games are best played by veterans.\"<ref name=Loth42/> He noted in 1986 that Midguard was a \"very complex game\" with a 100-page instruction manual and \"255 possible line entries\".<ref name=Loth42/><ref name=Townsend88a/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' was \"the most complex game system on Earth\".<ref name=Townsend88a/> Other games, like Galactic Prisoners began simply and gradually increased in complexity.<ref name=Loth42/>\n\n==Cost and turn processing time==\nLoth noted that, in 1986, $3\u20135 per turn was the most prevalent cost.<ref name=Loth43>[[#Lot86a|John Kevin Loth III 1986]]. p. 43.</ref> At the time, some games were free, while some costed as much as $100 per turn.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\nPlay-by-mail magazine ''Paper Mayhem'' stated that the average turn processing time in 1987 was two weeks, and Loth noted that this was also the most popular.<ref>[[#Pap87d|Paper Mayhem Sep/Oct 1987]]. p. 1.</ref><ref name=Loth43/> In 1986, play-by-email was a nascent service only being offered by the largest PBM companies.<ref name=Loth43/>\n\n==Information sources==\nJohn Kevin Loth stated that, in 1986, the \"three major information sources in PBM\" were ''Paper Mayhem'', ''Flagship Magazine'', and the [[Play By Mail Association]].<ref name=Loth43/> Minor sources included magazines such as \"''[[Different Worlds]]'', [[Dragon (magazine)|''Dragon'']], ''[[Game New]]'', [[Imagine (game magazine)|''Imagine'']], and [[White Dwarf (magazine)|''White Dwarf'']]\".<ref name=Loth43/> Game and company-specific publications also provided significant information, as well as \"alliances, associations, and senior players\".<ref name=Loth43/> ''[[White Wolf Magazine]]'' also began a regular PBM column beginning in issue #11 as well as publishing an annual PBM issue beginning with issue #16.<ref>[[#Whi88|White Wolf 1988]]. p. 2.</ref><ref>[[#Whi89|White Wolf 1989]]. p. 1.</ref>\n\n''Flagship Magazine'' ran into the 21st Century, but ceased publication in 2010.
