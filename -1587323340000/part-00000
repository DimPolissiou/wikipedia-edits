{"title_page": "Violence against Muslims in India", "text_new": "Article is against believes of India. Deep offence to Indian history.\n\n==Manifestation==\nViolence against Muslims is frequently in the form of mob attacks on [[Muslim]]s by [[Hindu]]s.{{sfn|Brass|2003|p=65|quote=Deaths in Hindu-Muslim riots have three sources: \"Mob action\", \"police killings\" and \"isolated incidents\". \"Mob action\" may take the form of confrontations between gangs or crowds from different communities or segments of them, armed with sticks, knives, swords, and occasionally bombs and small weapons, and kerosene. It often involves armed gangs from one community seeking out defenseless persons or whole families in their homes, slashing and cutting up the male members and sometimes the female members, and raping the latter, and burning all alive including the children. A second source is police killings, which account for a large number of deaths in several major riots for which figures have been provided by inquiry commission reports, and which cannot be justified in terms of \"crowd control\". These killings are disproportionately of Muslims.}}{{sfn|Riaz|2008|p=165|ps=: \"Violence perpetrated against Muslims is now naturalized: riots are 'well-known and accepted transgression of routine political behavior in India.' ... 'Hindu-Muslim riots and anti-Muslim pogroms have been endemic in India since independence.'\"}} These attacks are referred to as [[Communal violence|communal riots]] in India and are seen to be part of a pattern of sporadic [[sectarian violence]] between the majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, and have also been connected to a rise in [[Islamophobia]] throughout the 20th century.{{sfn|Herman|2006|p=65}} Most incidents have occurred in the northern and western states of India, whereas communalist sentiment in the south is less pronounced.{{sfn|Cohen|2013|p=66}} Among the largest incidents were [[Great Calcutta killings]] in 1946, [[Noakhali riots#Repercussions in Bihar|Bihar]] and Garmukhteshwar in 1946 after [[Noakhali riot]] in East Bengal, the massacre of Muslims in [[Jammu Division|Jammu]] in 1947, large-scale killing of Muslims following the [[Operation Polo]] in [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], anti-Muslim riots in Kolkata in the aftermath of [[1950 Barisal Riots]] and [[1964 East-Pakistan riots]], [[1969 Gujarat riots]], [[1984 Bhiwandi riot]], [[1985 Gujarat riots]], [[1989 Bhagalpur riots]], [[Bombay riots]],  [[Nellie massacre|Nellie]] in 1983{{sfn|Ganguly|2007|p=135}} and [[2002 Gujarat violence|Gujarat riot]] in 2002 and [[2013 Muzaffarnagar riots]].\n\nThese patterns of violence have been well-established since partition, with dozens of studies documenting instances of mass violence against minority groups.{{sfn|Pennington|2012|p=32}} Over 10,000 people have been killed in Hindu-Muslim communal violence since 1950.{{sfn|Dhattiwala|2012|pp=483\u2013516}} According to official figures, there were 6,933 instances of communal violence between 1954 and 1982 and, between 1968 and 1980, there were 530 Hindus and 1,598 Muslims killed in a total of 3,949 instances of mass violence.{{sfn|Brass|2003|p=60}}\n\nIn 1989, there were incidents of mass violence throughout the north of India.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=29}}  [[Praveen Swami]] believes these periodic acts of violence have \"scarred India's post independence history\" and have also hindered India's cause in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] with regard to the [[Kashmir conflict]].{{sfn|Swami|2006|p=217}}\n\nIn 2017, IndiaSpend reported that 84% of the victims of [[cow vigilante violence in India since 2014|cow vigilante violence in India]] from 2010 to 2017 were Muslims, and almost 97% of these attacks were reported after May 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Ojaswi|last2=Abraham|first2=Delna|title=86% Dead In Cow-Related Violence Since 2010 Are Muslim; 97% Attacks After 2014|url=http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/86-dead-in-cow-related-violence-since-2010-are-muslim-97-attacks-after-2014-2014|website=IndiaSpend.com|accessdate=23 September 2017|date=28 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilkes \n|first1=Tommy|last2=Srivastava|first2=Roli|title=Protests held across India after attacks against Muslims|url=https://in.reuters.com/article/india-protests/protests-held-across-india-after-attacks-against-muslims-idINKBN19J2C3|website=Reuters|accessdate=11 March 2020|date=28 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Causes and effects==\n{{location map+|India|float=right|width=400|caption=Location of incidents.

In particular, scholars fault the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Shiv Sena]] for complicity in these incidents of violence{{sfn|Brass|b}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Sarkur|2007|p=187}}{{sfn|Brekke|2012|pp=86\u201387}} and of using violence against Muslims as a part of a larger electoral strategy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=382}} For example, research by Raheel Dhattiwala and Michael Biggs has stated that killings are far higher in areas where the BJP faces stiff electoral opposition than in areas in which it is already strong.{{sfn|Dhattiwala|2012|pp=483\u2013516}} In 1989, the north of India saw an increase in orchestrated attacks on Muslims, and the BJP had further success in the local and state elections.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}} The [[social anthropologist]] [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah]] concludes that the violence in [[Bhagalpur]] in [[1989 Bhagalpur violence|1989]], Hashimpura in [[Hashimpura massacre|1987]] and in [[Moradabad]] [[1980 Moradabad riots|1980]] were organised killings.{{sfn|Tambiah|1997|p=321}} According to [[Ram Puniyani]], the Shiv Sena  were victorious in the elections due to the violence in the 1990s, and the BJP in Gujarat after the 2002 violence.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} [[Gyan Prakash]], however, cautions that the BJP's actions in Gujarat do not equate to the entirety of India, and it remains to be seen if the [[Hindutva]] movement has been successful in the deployment of this strategy nationwide.{{sfn|Prakash|2007|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\n===Economic and cultural factors===\nHindu nationalists use the historical [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|subjugation]] of India by Muslims as an excuse for violence. They feel that, since the Partition, Indian Muslims are [[Pro-Pakistan sentiment|allied to Pakistan]] and are possibly radicalised  and, therefore, the Hindus must take defensive steps to avoid repeat of the past wrongs and reassert their pride.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Etzion|2008|pp=123\u2013124}} The higher fertility rate among Muslims has been a recurring theme in the Hindu Right's rhetoric. They claim that the [[Islam in India#Population growth rate|higher]] birth rate among Muslims is part of a plan to turn the Hindus into a minority within their own country.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Weigl|2012|p=19}}\n\nAnother reason given for these outbreaks of violence is the upward mobility of the [[Caste system in India|lower castes]] caused by the expansion of the economy. The violence has become a substitute for class tensions.  Nationalists, rather than deal with the claims from the lower class, instead view Muslims and Christians as not \"fully Indian\" due to their religion,{{sfn|Metcalf|2006|p=89}} and portray those who carry out these attacks as \"heroes\" that defended the majority from \"anti-nationals\".{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} Muslims are viewed as suspect and their loyalty to the state is questioned because of the ill-will still prevalent after the violence during [[Partition of India|partition]]. According to [[Omar Khalidi]]:\n\n<blockquote>Anti-Muslim violence is planned and executed to render Muslims economically and socially crippled and, as a final outcome of that economic and social backwardness, assimilating them into lower rungs of Hindu society.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|p=153}}</blockquote>\n\n[[Cultural nationalism]] has also been given as a reason for instances of violence carried out by [[Shiv Sena]] which initially claimed to speak for the people of [[Maharashtra]], but quickly turned their [[rhetoric]] to inciting violence against Muslims. The Shiv Sena were complicit in the violence in 1984 in the town of [[Bhiwandi]], and again in the violence in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=29}} Violence has been incited by Sena in 1971 and 1986.{{sfn|Kaur|2005|p=160}}{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}}  According to [[Sudipta Kaviraj]], the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) are still engaged in the religious conflicts which began in the medieval times.{{sfn|Kaviraj|2010|p=245}}\n\nAnti-Muslim violence creates a security risk for Hindus residing outside of India. Since the 1950s, there have been retaliatory attacks on Hindus in Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]] in response to anti-Muslim violence in India. After the 1992 violence in Bombay, Hindu temples were attacked in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Dubai]] and [[Thailand]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2006|p=16}} This recurring violence has become a rigidly conventional pattern which has created a divide between the Muslim and Hindu communities.{{sfn|Shani|2007|p=187}}\n\n[[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind]] has spoken out against these communal clashes, as it believes that the violence not only impacts upon Muslims, but India as a whole, and that these riots are damaging to India's progress.{{sfn|Sikand|2004|p=86}} In Gujarat, the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA) was used in incidents pertaining to communal violence in 1992 and 1993.  The majority of those arrested under the act were Muslim.  Conversely, TADA was not used after the violence carried out against Muslims during the [[Bombay riots]].{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=427}}\n\n===Demographics===\nThe BJP politicians, as well as those of other parties, argue that [[demographics]] play an essential role in Indian elections. The BJP believe that the higher the number of Muslims within a constituency, the higher are the chances of centrist parties  to acquiesce to minority groups' requests, which lowers the chances of Muslims \"building bridges\" with their Hindu neighbours.  As such, according to this argument \"Muslim appeasement\" is the root cause of communal violence.{{sfn|Varshney|2003|p=8}} Susanne and Lloyd Rudolph argue that the economic disparity is a reason for the aggression shown towards Muslims by Hindus. As India's economy expanded due to [[globalization]] and [[investment]] from overseas companies, the expectations of the Hindu population were not matched by the opportunities. Hindu nationalists then encouraged the perception of Muslims as the source of the Hindus' troubles.{{sfn|Price|2012|p=95}}\n\nThe actions of anti-Hindu and [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|anti-India militant groups]] in [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]] and Pakistan have reinforced anti-Muslim feelings in India, which has strengthened the Hindu Right. The [[Hindutva]] discourse portrays Muslims as traitors and state enemies, whose patriotism is suspected.{{sfn|Sikand|2006|p=88}} [[Sumit Ganguly]] argues that the rise in terrorism cannot only be attributed to [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] factors, but also to the violence perpetrated by Hindutva forces.{{sfn|Ganguly|2003|p=10}}\n\n==Major incidents==\n\n===1964 Kolkata===\nRiots between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s had left over a hundred people dead, 438 people were injured. Over 7000 people were arrested. 70,000 Muslims have fled their homes and 55,000 were provided protection by the [[Indian army]]. Muslims in Kolkata became more ghettoized than ever before in the aftermath of this riot. The riot was believed to be instigated by violence against Hindus in [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh) and the flow of refugees from there. Violence was also seen in rural [[West Bengal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1964: Riots in Calcutta leave more than 100 dead|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/13/newsid_4098000/4098363.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1983 Nellie massacre===\nIn the state of [[Assam]] in 1983 the [[Nellie massacre]] occurred. Nearly 1,800 Muslims of Bengali origin were slaughtered by [[Lalung]] tribespeople (also known as Tiwa) at a village called Nellie.{{sfn|Hazarika|1984}}{{sfn|Kokrajhar|Dhubri|2012}} It has been described as one of the most severe massacres since [[World War II]] with the majority of victims being women and children, as a result of the actions of the [[Assam Movement]].{{sfn|Ghosh|2004|p=312}}{{sfn|Hussain|2009|p=261}}\n\nOne reason cited for this incident is that it resulted from a build-up of resentment over immigration.{{sfn|Datta|2012|p=183}} The Assam movement insisted on striking the names of [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] from the electoral register and their deportation from the state. There was widespread support for the movement, which tapered off between 1981 and 1982.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=481}}\n\nThe movement demanded that anyone who had entered the state illegally since 1951 be deported.  The central government, however, insisted on a cutoff date of 1971. Towards the end of 1982, the central government called elections and the movement called for people to [[boycott]] it, which led to the widespread violence.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=418}}\n\nThe official Tiwari Commission report on the Nellie massacre is still a closely guarded secret (only three copies exist).<ref name=\"AT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/details.asp?id=feb1908/at02|title=83 polls were a mistake: KPS Gill|publisher=Assam Tribune|date= 18 February 2008|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> The 600-page report was submitted to the Assam Government in 1984 and the Congress Government (headed by [[Hiteswar Saikia]]) decided not to make it public, and subsequent Governments followed suit.<ref name=\"Tehelka\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|title=An Untold Shame|last=Rehman|first=Teresa|publisher=Tehelka Magazine|accessdate=2011-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111192753/http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|archive-date=11 November 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Assam United Democratic Front]] and others are making legal efforts to make Tiwari Commission report public, so that reasonable justice is delivered to victims, at least after 25 years after the incident.<ref>{{cite news | last =Reporter | first =Staff | title =Flashback to Nellie Horror:AUDF to move court for probe report | newspaper =The Telegraph | date =19 February 2008 | url =http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080219/jsp/guwahati/story_8920369.jsp |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince, then there have been no instances of communal violence in [[Upper Assam Division|Upper Assam]].{{sfn|Saikia|2005|p=65}}\n\n===1969 to 1989===\nDuring the [[1969 Gujarat riots]], it is estimated that 630 people lost their lives.{{sfn|Khalidi|2009|p=180}} The [[1970 Bhiwandi Riots]] was an instance of anti-Muslim violence which occurred between 7 and 8 May in the Indian towns of Bhiwandi, Jalgaon and Mahad. There were large amounts of arson and vandalism of Muslim-owned properties. In 1980 in Moradabad, an estimated 2,500 people were killed.  The official estimate is 400 and other observers estimate between 1,500 and 2,000. Local police were directly implicated in planning the violence.{{sfn|Engineer|1991|p=209}} In 1989 in Bhagalpur, it is estimated nearly 1,000 people lost their lives in violent attacks,{{sfn|Khalidi|2009|p=180}} believed to be a result of tensions raised over the [[Ayodhya dispute]] and the processions carried out by VHP activists, which were to be a show of strength and to serve as a warning to the minority communities.{{sfn|Berglund|2011|p=105}}\n\n===1987 Hashimpura massacre===\n{{main|Hashimpura massacre}}\n[[Hashimpura massacre]] happened on 22 May 1987, during the [[1987 Meerut Riots|Hindu-Muslim riots]] in [[Meerut]] city in [[Uttar Pradesh]] state, India, when 19 personnel of the [[Uttar Pradesh Provincial Armed Constabulary|Provincial Armed Constabulary]] (PAC) allegedly rounded up 42 Muslim youth from the Hashimpura ''[[mohalla]]'' (locality) of the city, took them in truck to the outskirts, near [[Murad Nagar]], in [[Ghaziabad district, India|Ghaziabad district]], where they were shot and their bodies were [[Dump job#Police usage|dumped]] in water canals.

It often involves armed gangs from one community seeking out defenseless persons or whole families in their homes, slashing and cutting up the male members and sometimes the female members, and raping the latter, and burning all alive including the children. A second source is police killings, which account for a large number of deaths in several major riots for which figures have been provided by inquiry commission reports, and which cannot be justified in terms of \"crowd control\". These killings are disproportionately of Muslims.}}{{sfn|Riaz|2008|p=165|ps=: \"Violence perpetrated against Muslims is now naturalized: riots are 'well-known and accepted transgression of routine political behavior in India.' ...

In particular, scholars fault the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Shiv Sena]] for complicity in these incidents of violence{{sfn|Brass|b}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Sarkur|2007|p=187}}{{sfn|Brekke|2012|pp=86\u201387}} and of using violence against Muslims as a part of a larger electoral strategy.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=376}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2011|p=382}} For example, research by Raheel Dhattiwala and Michael Biggs has stated that killings are far higher in areas where the BJP faces stiff electoral opposition than in areas in which it is already strong.{{sfn|Dhattiwala|2012|pp=483\u2013516}} In 1989, the north of India saw an increase in orchestrated attacks on Muslims, and the BJP had further success in the local and state elections.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}} The [[social anthropologist]] [[Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah]] concludes that the violence in [[Bhagalpur]] in [[1989 Bhagalpur violence|1989]], Hashimpura in [[Hashimpura massacre|1987]] and in [[Moradabad]] [[1980 Moradabad riots|1980]] were organised killings.{{sfn|Tambiah|1997|p=321}} According to [[Ram Puniyani]], the Shiv Sena  were victorious in the elections due to the violence in the 1990s, and the BJP in Gujarat after the 2002 violence.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} [[Gyan Prakash]], however, cautions that the BJP's actions in Gujarat do not equate to the entirety of India, and it remains to be seen if the [[Hindutva]] movement has been successful in the deployment of this strategy nationwide.{{sfn|Prakash|2007|pp=177\u2013179}}\n\n===Economic and cultural factors===\nHindu nationalists use the historical [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|subjugation]] of India by Muslims as an excuse for violence. They feel that, since the Partition, Indian Muslims are [[Pro-Pakistan sentiment|allied to Pakistan]] and are possibly radicalised  and, therefore, the Hindus must take defensive steps to avoid repeat of the past wrongs and reassert their pride.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Etzion|2008|pp=123\u2013124}} The higher fertility rate among Muslims has been a recurring theme in the Hindu Right's rhetoric. They claim that the [[Islam in India#Population growth rate|higher]] birth rate among Muslims is part of a plan to turn the Hindus into a minority within their own country.{{Original research inline|date=August 2015}}{{sfn|Weigl|2012|p=19}}\n\nAnother reason given for these outbreaks of violence is the upward mobility of the [[Caste system in India|lower castes]] caused by the expansion of the economy. The violence has become a substitute for class tensions.  Nationalists, rather than deal with the claims from the lower class, instead view Muslims and Christians as not \"fully Indian\" due to their religion,{{sfn|Metcalf|2006|p=89}} and portray those who carry out these attacks as \"heroes\" that defended the majority from \"anti-nationals\".{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|pp=12\u201313}} Muslims are viewed as suspect and their loyalty to the state is questioned because of the ill-will still prevalent after the violence during [[Partition of India|partition]]. According to [[Omar Khalidi]]:\n\n<blockquote>Anti-Muslim violence is planned and executed to render Muslims economically and socially crippled and, as a final outcome of that economic and social backwardness, assimilating them into lower rungs of Hindu society.{{sfn|Puniyan|2003|p=153}}</blockquote>\n\n[[Cultural nationalism]] has also been given as a reason for instances of violence carried out by [[Shiv Sena]] which initially claimed to speak for the people of [[Maharashtra]], but quickly turned their [[rhetoric]] to inciting violence against Muslims. The Shiv Sena were complicit in the violence in 1984 in the town of [[Bhiwandi]], and again in the violence in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=29}} Violence has been incited by Sena in 1971 and 1986.{{sfn|Kaur|2005|p=160}}{{sfn|Chandavarkar|2009|p=114}}  According to [[Sudipta Kaviraj]], the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP) are still engaged in the religious conflicts which began in the medieval times.{{sfn|Kaviraj|2010|p=245}}\n\nAnti-Muslim violence creates a security risk for Hindus residing outside of India. Since the 1950s, there have been retaliatory attacks on Hindus in Pakistan and [[Bangladesh]] in response to anti-Muslim violence in India. After the 1992 violence in Bombay, Hindu temples were attacked in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Dubai]] and [[Thailand]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2006|p=16}} This recurring violence has become a rigidly conventional pattern which has created a divide between the Muslim and Hindu communities.{{sfn|Shani|2007|p=187}}\n\n[[Jamaat-e-Islami Hind]] has spoken out against these communal clashes, as it believes that the violence not only impacts upon Muslims, but India as a whole, and that these riots are damaging to India's progress.{{sfn|Sikand|2004|p=86}} In Gujarat, the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA) was used in incidents pertaining to communal violence in 1992 and 1993.  The majority of those arrested under the act were Muslim.  Conversely, TADA was not used after the violence carried out against Muslims during the [[Bombay riots]].{{sfn|Singh|2012|p=427}}\n\n===Demographics===\nThe BJP politicians, as well as those of other parties, argue that [[demographics]] play an essential role in Indian elections. The BJP believe that the higher the number of Muslims within a constituency, the higher are the chances of centrist parties  to acquiesce to minority groups' requests, which lowers the chances of Muslims \"building bridges\" with their Hindu neighbours.  As such, according to this argument \"Muslim appeasement\" is the root cause of communal violence.{{sfn|Varshney|2003|p=8}} Susanne and Lloyd Rudolph argue that the economic disparity is a reason for the aggression shown towards Muslims by Hindus. As India's economy expanded due to [[globalization]] and [[investment]] from overseas companies, the expectations of the Hindu population were not matched by the opportunities. Hindu nationalists then encouraged the perception of Muslims as the source of the Hindus' troubles.{{sfn|Price|2012|p=95}}\n\nThe actions of anti-Hindu and [[Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir|anti-India militant groups]] in [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]] and Pakistan have reinforced anti-Muslim feelings in India, which has strengthened the Hindu Right. The [[Hindutva]] discourse portrays Muslims as traitors and state enemies, whose patriotism is suspected.{{sfn|Sikand|2006|p=88}} [[Sumit Ganguly]] argues that the rise in terrorism cannot only be attributed to [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] factors, but also to the violence perpetrated by Hindutva forces.{{sfn|Ganguly|2003|p=10}}\n\n==Major incidents==\n\n===1964 Kolkata===\nRiots between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s had left over a hundred people dead, 438 people were injured. Over 7000 people were arrested. 70,000 Muslims have fled their homes and 55,000 were provided protection by the [[Indian army]]. Muslims in Kolkata became more ghettoized than ever before in the aftermath of this riot. The riot was believed to be instigated by violence against Hindus in [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh) and the flow of refugees from there. Violence was also seen in rural [[West Bengal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1964: Riots in Calcutta leave more than 100 dead|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/13/newsid_4098000/4098363.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1983 Nellie massacre===\nIn the state of [[Assam]] in 1983 the [[Nellie massacre]] occurred. Nearly 1,800 Muslims of Bengali origin were slaughtered by [[Lalung]] tribespeople (also known as Tiwa) at a village called Nellie.{{sfn|Hazarika|1984}}{{sfn|Kokrajhar|Dhubri|2012}} It has been described as one of the most severe massacres since [[World War II]] with the majority of victims being women and children, as a result of the actions of the [[Assam Movement]].{{sfn|Ghosh|2004|p=312}}{{sfn|Hussain|2009|p=261}}\n\nOne reason cited for this incident is that it resulted from a build-up of resentment over immigration.{{sfn|Datta|2012|p=183}} The Assam movement insisted on striking the names of [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] from the electoral register and their deportation from the state. There was widespread support for the movement, which tapered off between 1981 and 1982.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=481}}\n\nThe movement demanded that anyone who had entered the state illegally since 1951 be deported.  The central government, however, insisted on a cutoff date of 1971. Towards the end of 1982, the central government called elections and the movement called for people to [[boycott]] it, which led to the widespread violence.{{sfn|Chatterji|2013|p=418}}\n\nThe official Tiwari Commission report on the Nellie massacre is still a closely guarded secret (only three copies exist).<ref name=\"AT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/details.asp?id=feb1908/at02|title=83 polls were a mistake: KPS Gill|publisher=Assam Tribune|date= 18 February 2008|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> The 600-page report was submitted to the Assam Government in 1984 and the Congress Government (headed by [[Hiteswar Saikia]]) decided not to make it public, and subsequent Governments followed suit.<ref name=\"Tehelka\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|title=An Untold Shame|last=Rehman|first=Teresa|publisher=Tehelka Magazine|accessdate=2011-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111192753/http://www.tehelka.com/story_main19.asp?filename=Ne093006the_horrors.asp|archive-date=11 November 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Assam United Democratic Front]] and others are making legal efforts to make Tiwari Commission report public, so that reasonable justice is delivered to victims, at least after 25 years after the incident.<ref>{{cite news | last =Reporter | first =Staff | title =Flashback to Nellie Horror:AUDF to move court for probe report | newspaper =The Telegraph | date =19 February 2008 | url =http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080219/jsp/guwahati/story_8920369.jsp |accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince, then there have been no instances of communal violence in [[Upper Assam Division|Upper Assam]].{{sfn|Saikia|2005|p=65}}\n\n===1969 to 1989===\nDuring the [[1969 Gujarat riots]], it is estimated that 630 people lost their lives.{{sfn|Khalidi|2009|p=180}} The [[1970 Bhiwandi Riots]] was an instance of anti-Muslim violence which occurred between 7 and 8 May in the Indian towns of Bhiwandi, Jalgaon and Mahad.

Currently, these traditions are summarized by the Six Sources and Seven Principles of Unitarian Universalism, documents recognized by all congregations who choose to be a part of the Unitarian Universalist Association. These documents are 'living', meaning always open for revisiting and reworking. Unitarian Universalist (U.U.) congregations include many atheists, agnostics, and theists within their membership - and there are U.U. churches / fellowships / congregations / societies all over America - as well as others around the world. The roots of Unitarian Universalism lie in [[liberal Christianity]], specifically [[Unitarianism]] and [[Christian universalism|universalism]]. Unitarian Universalists state that from these traditions comes a deep regard for intellectual freedom and inclusive love.

The term may refer to any belief about the nature of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] that affirms [[God]] as a singular entity and rejects the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], as affirmed by the [[Nicene Creed|mainstream Christianity]]: a consensus of Christian bishops at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Nontrinitarianism was especially prevalent during the theological turmoils of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A Spanish physician, [[Michael Servetus]], studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity, as traditionally conceived, was not biblical. His books ''On the Errors of the Trinity'' and ''Christianismi Restitutio'' caused much uproar. Servetus was eventually arrested, convicted of heresy, and burned at the stake in [[Geneva]] in 1553.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miguelservet.org/servetus/biography.htm |title=Michael Servetus Institute; Times that Servetus lived |publisher=Miguelservet.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Unitarian\" entered the English language via [[Henry Hedworth]], who applied it to the teachings of [[Laelio Sozzini]] and the Polish [[Socinians]]. Unitarian churches were formally established in [[Transylvania]] and [[Poland]] (by the [[Socinianism|Socinians]]) in the second half of the 16th century.<ref name=\"Harris\">Harris, MW. Unitarian Universalist Origins: Our Historic Faith</ref> There, the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established (in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568, see [[Edict of Torda]]) under the jurisdiction of [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya|John Sigismund]], king of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania, the only Unitarian monarch. The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity, but also the [[pre-existence of Christ]] as well as, in many cases, [[predestination]] and [[original sin]] as put forward by [[Augustine of Hippo]], and the [[substitutionary atonement]] of Christ developed by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and John Calvin. There were several different forms of [[Christology]] in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement; ultimately, the dominant Christology became [[psilanthropism]]: that Jesus was a man, but one with a unique relationship to God.\n\n====Britain====\n{{main|History of Unitarianism}}\nInfluenced by the teachings of the Polish [[Socinians]], [[Samuel Clarke]] (1675\u20131729) revised the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', removing the Trinitarian [[Nicene Creed]] and references to [[divinity of Jesus|Jesus as God]].<ref name=Clarke>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanunitarian.org/fisherhistory.htm |title=Chris Fisher, ''A Brief History of Unitarian Christianity'', retrieved July 18, 2008 |publisher=Americanunitarian.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref> [[Theophilus Lindsey]] also revised the ''Book of Common Prayer'' to allow a more tolerant, free Unitarian interpretation. Neither cleric was charged under the [[Blasphemy Act 1697]] that made it an \"offense for any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the [[Holy Trinity]]\". The [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] (1689) gave relief to [[English Dissenters]], but excluded Unitarians. The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the [[Church of England]].

We celebrate the spiritual insights of the world\u2019s religions, recognizing wisdom in many scriptures.\n\nWhen we read scripture in worship, whether it is the [[Bible]], the [[Dhammapada]], or the [[Tao Te-Ching]], we interpret it as a product of its time and its place,\u2026not to be interpreted narrowly or oppressively\u2026<nowiki>[</nowiki>S<nowiki>]</nowiki>cripture is never the only word, or the final word.\n\nFrom the beginning we have trusted in the human capacity to use reason and draw conclusions about religion\u2026 [E]ach of us ultimately chooses what is sacred to us.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Sacred texts in Unitarian Universalism\n |url=https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe/sacred-texts\n |access-date=2017-12-05\n}}</ref>}}\n\nIn short, Unitarian Universalists regard the texts of the world's religions as works of people, worthy of respect, with the intention that people from all religions or spiritual backgrounds live peaceably with one another.\n\n==Worship and practice==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Diversity of practices===\nThe Unitarian belief that reason, and not creed, defines the search for truth, and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally has led to the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths. This is reflected in the wide array of spiritual practices found among Unitarian Universalists today. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist-style meditation groups, Jewish [[Passover Seder|Seder]], [[Yom Kippur]] and Passover dinners, ''[[iftaar]]'' meals (marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims), and Christmas Eve/[[Winter Solstice#Observances|Winter Solstice]] services. Children's and youth's religious education classes teach about the divinity of the world and the sanctity of world religions. One of its more popular curricula, Neighboring Faiths (formerly Church Across the Street), takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a [[Hindu]] temple, a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue, and a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church.\n\nThere is great variety among Unitarian Universalist congregations, with some favoring particular religious beliefs or forms of worship over others, with many more home to an eclectic mix of beliefs. Regardless of their orientation, most congregations are fairly open to differing beliefs, though not always with various faith traditions represented to the same degree.\n\n===Diversity of congregations===\nThere is a wide variety in how congregations conceive of themselves, calling themselves \"churches\", \"societies\", \"fellowships\", \"congregations\", or eschew the use of any particular descriptor (e.g. \"[http://www.uusanmateo.org Unitarian Universalists of San Mateo]\"). Many use the name \"Unitarian Universalist\", (and a few \"Universalist Unitarian\"), having gradually adopted this formulation since consolidation in 1961. Others use names that reflect their historic roots by keeping the historical designation \"Unitarian\" or \"Universalist\" (e.g. \"[[First Unitarian Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|First Unitarian Church]]\"). A few congregations use neither (e.g. [[Unity Temple]]). For some congregations, the name can be a clue to their theological orientation. For others, avoidance of the word \"church\" indicates a desire to distance itself from traditional Christian theology. Sometimes the use of another term may simply indicate a congregation's lay-led or relatively new status. However, some Unitarian Universalist congregations have grown to appreciate alternative terms such as ''fellowship'' and retained them even though they have grown much larger or lost features sometimes associated with their use (such as, in the case of fellowships, a traditionally lay-led worship model).<ref>See for examples: [http://www.uufellowship.org Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Northern Westchester] and [http://www.uuathensga.org/ Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens].</ref>\n\nAlso of note is that there are many more people who identify as Unitarian Universalist on surveys than those who attend Unitarian Universalist congregations (by a factor of four in a recent survey),<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html Largest Religious Groups in the United States of America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820080454/http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html |date=2018-08-20 }}, Adherents.com</ref> reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the Unitarian Universalist movement.\n\n===Elevator speeches===\nIn 2004, ''UU World'' magazine asked for contributions of \"[[elevator pitch|elevator speeches]]\" explaining Unitarian Universalism.<ref>''UU World Magazine''.

Therefore, one's own truth is unprovable, as is that of others. Consequently, we should respect the beliefs of others, as well as their right to hold those beliefs. Conversely, we expect that others should respect our right to our own beliefs. Several UU's then, would likely hold as many different beliefs. Other beliefs they may hold in common are a respect for others, for nature, and for common decency, leading to a particular caring for the poor, the weak and the downtrodden.

In form, church services might be difficult to distinguish from those of a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] church, but they vary widely among congregations.<ref name=\"Sias\"/>\n\n===Symbols===\nThe most common symbol of Unitarian Universalism is the [[flaming chalice]], often framed by two overlapping rings that many interpret as representing Unitarianism and Universalism (the symbol has no official interpretation). The chalice itself has long been a symbol of liberal religion, and indeed liberal Christianity (the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] also use a chalice as their denomination symbol<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |title=The Chalice \n |accessdate=2012-01-21 \n |publisher=[[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112154823/http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |archivedate=January 12, 2012 \n}}</ref>). The flaming chalice was initially the logo of the Unitarian Service Committee during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. It was created by Austrian artist [[Hans Deutsch]]. The holy oil burning in it is a symbol of helpfulness and sacrifice.\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/aboutuu/chalice.html\n| title = The History of the Flaming Chalice\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Adapted from the pamphlet \"The Flaming Chalice\" by Daniel D. Hotchkiss\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, other interpretations have been suggested, such as the chalice used by the followers of Czech [[Jan Hus]], which was supposedly reverential of Eastern Orthodox traditions; although Hus's early National Church was intrinsically an evangelical Protestant. In some agnostic historiographies the flaming chalice displayed a vague resemblance to a cross in some stylized representations, relying on the sepulchral traditions of the Hospitallers.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark W.|last=Harris|title=The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism| publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=London}}</ref>   Many Unitarian Universalist congregations light a chalice at the beginning of worship services. Other symbols include an [[Christian cross variants#Modern innovations|off-center cross within a circle]] (a Universalist symbol associated with the Humiliati movement in the 1950s, a group of reformist, liturgically minded clergy seeking to revive Universalism).\n\nOther symbols include a pair of open hands releasing a [[dove]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://archive.uua.org/CONG/chalices/\n| title = UU Chalices and Clip Art\n| accessdate = 2008-04-12\n| author = Steve Bridenbaugh\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\n===Services of worship===\n[[File:UM 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[First Unitarian Society of Madison|Unitarian Meeting House]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin]].]]\nReligious services are usually held on Sundays and most closely resemble the form and format of Protestant worship in the Reformed tradition.<ref name=\"Sias\"/> Services at a vast majority of congregations follow a structure that focuses on a sermon or presentation by a minister, a lay leader of the congregation, or an invited speaker.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html\n| title = Common Worship: How and Why; The contribution of Von Ogden Vogt\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Commission on Common Worship\n| year = 1983\n| work = Leading Congregations in Worship: A Guide\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217132901/http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-17}}</ref> Sermons may cover a wide range of topics. Since Unitarian Universalists do not recognize a particular text or set of texts as primary or inherently superior, inspiration can be found in many different religious or cultural texts as well as the personal experiences of the minister.\n\nThe service also includes hymn-singing, accompanied by organ, piano, or other available instruments, and possibly led by a song leader or choir. The most recent worship songbook published by the denomination, ''Singing the Journey''<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-499-1|title=Singing the Journey|year=2005}}</ref> contains 75 songs and is a supplement to the older ''Singing the Living Tradition'' which contains readings as well.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-260-3|title=Singing the Living Tradition|year=1993}}</ref> Hymns typically sung in Unitarian Universalist services come from a variety of sources\u2014traditional [[hymn tune]]s with new or adapted lyrics, spirituals, folk songs from various cultures, or original compositions by Unitarian Universalist musicians are just a few. Instrumental music is also a common feature of the typical worship service, including preludes, offertory music, postludes, or music for contemplation.\n\nPastoral elements of the service may include a time for sharing Joys and Sorrows/Concerns, where individuals in the congregation are invited to [[Ceremonial use of lights|light a candle]] or say a few words about important events in their personal lives. Many also include a time of [[meditation]] or [[prayer]], led by the minister or service leader, both spoken and silent. Responsive readings and stories for children are also typical. Many congregations also allow for a time at the end of the service, called \"talk back\", where members of the congregation can respond to the sermon with their own insights and questions, or even disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister or invited speaker.\n\nMany Unitarian Universalist congregations no longer observe the Christian symbols of [[baptism]], [[Eucharist|communion]], or [[confirmation]], at least in their traditional forms or under their traditional names. Congregations that continue these practices under their more traditional names are often [[federated congregation|federated church]]es or members of the Council of Christian Churches within the Unitarian Universalist Association (CCCUUA), or may have active chapters associated with the [[Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship]] or similar covenant groups.<ref>[http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm Christians 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108233643/http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm |date=January 8, 2009 }}</ref> \"Child dedications\" often replace more traditional infant baptisms (such \"dedications\" are sometimes practiced even in \"orthodox\" Christian communities that do not baptize infants for theological reasons).

The \n[[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|second women's rights convention]] was held at the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester|First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York]].

Anthony]], a Unitarian and [[Quaker]], was extremely influential in the women's [[suffrage]] movement. Unitarian Universalists and Quakers still share many principles. It is therefore common to see Unitarian Universalists and Quakers working together.\n\nUnitarian Universalists were and are still very involved in the fight to end [[racism]] in the United States. [[John Haynes Holmes]], a Unitarian minister and social activist at The Community Church of New York\u2014Unitarian Universalist were among the founders of both the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909 and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), chairing the latter for a time. [[James J. Reeb]], a minister at [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)|All Souls Church, Unitarian]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] and a member of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], was clubbed in [[Selma, Alabama]] on March 8, 1965, and died two days later of massive head trauma. Two weeks after his death, [[Viola Liuzzo]], a Unitarian Universalist civil rights activist, was murdered by white supremacists after her participation in the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] for voting rights are best known for [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]], which refers to March 7, 1965, the most violent of the three marches.\n\nThe past head of the Unitarian Universalist Association 2001\u20132009, [[William G.

Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither religious liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics. Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists, politics are decided by individuals, not by congregations or the denomination.\n\nSeveral congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a \"[[Unitarian Universalism and LGBT topics#Welcoming Congregation|Welcoming Congregation]]\": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual & transgender (LGBT) members. Unitarian Universalist ministers perform [[same-sex unions]] and now [[same-sex marriages]] where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church \"to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0DB1539F93AA15755C0A962948260 \"Unitarians Endorse Homosexual Marriages\"], UPI, ''The New York Times'', 29 June 1984.</ref> Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly [[ordained]] as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, [[Arlington Street Church (Boston)|Arlington Street Church]], in Boston, Massachusetts, was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage\u2014\"Standing on the Side of Love\". In 2004 UU minister Debra Haffner of [[The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing]] published ''An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality'' to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the [[District of Columbia]] in [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)]]\n\n[[Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness]] engages Unitarian Universalist ministers and other leaders to educate them on [[polyamory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uupa.org|title=UUPA website }}</ref> At the 2015 [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|UUA General Assembly]], the Association's non-discrimination rule was amended to include the category of \"family and relationship structures\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |title=Unitarian Universalist Association: Rule II, Section C-2.3.: Non-discrimination |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103753/http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |archivedate=2015-05-18}}</ref> the UUA has yet to take specific follow-up action on this, however.\n\nMany congregations are heavily involved in projects and efforts aimed at supporting environmental causes and [[sustainability]].

The [[American Unitarian Conference]] and the [[Christian Universalist Association]] are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today. Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists and heirs of the theological legacy of the original [[American Unitarian Association]] or [[Universalist Church of America]], and they do not wish to be confused with Unitarian Universalists. The [[Unity Church]] is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism.<ref>See [http://www.americanunitarian.org/voicearticle.htm \"Why the American Unitarian Conference Had to Be Formed\"] and [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/unitarian.html \"What Is the Difference between Christian Universalism and Unitarian Universalism?\"]</ref>\n\n===Internal===\n\n====Language of reverence====\nDuring the presidency of William Sinkford, debate within the Unitarian Universalist movement has roiled over his call to return to or create an authentic Unitarian Universalist \"language of reverence.\" Sinkford has suggested that Unitarian Universalists have abandoned traditional religious language, thereby abandoning words with potential power to others who will then dictate their meanings in the public sphere. He has suggested that Unitarian Universalists regain their proper seat at the interfaith table by making this language their own. Others have reacted to this call by believing it to be part of an effort to return Unitarian Universalist congregations to more orthodox Christian worship patterns. Sinkford has denied this, citing the words of Unitarian Universalist humanists as examples of what he means by the \"language of reverence.\" The growth of humanism in Unitarianism was determined by a desire to raise the profile to a universal audience, educating atheists and agnostics in biblical literacy among the wider congregation of Unitarian Universalists, many of whom were born into families that lacked the rigour of a moral catechism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uuworld.org/articles/need-language-reverence|title=Human reverence: The language of reverence is the language of humanity|date=2006-07-31|first=Kendyl L.R.|last=Gibbons|publisher=UU World: Liberal religion and life|accessdate=2017-12-26}}</ref>\nThe debate included the publication of a book by the UUA's [[Beacon Press]] written by former UUA President John Buehrens.<ref>{{cite web|last=Buehrens |first=John A. |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/132/story_13272_1.html |title=Past Unitarian Universalist Association President John A.

The term may refer to any belief about the nature of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] that affirms [[God]] as a singular entity and rejects the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], as affirmed by the [[Nicene Creed|mainstream Christianity]]: a consensus of Christian bishops at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Nontrinitarianism was especially prevalent during the theological turmoils of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. A Spanish physician, [[Michael Servetus]], studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity, as traditionally conceived, was not biblical. His books ''On the Errors of the Trinity'' and ''Christianismi Restitutio'' caused much uproar. Servetus was eventually arrested, convicted of heresy, and burned at the stake in [[Geneva]] in 1553.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miguelservet.org/servetus/biography.htm |title=Michael Servetus Institute; Times that Servetus lived |publisher=Miguelservet.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Unitarian\" entered the English language via [[Henry Hedworth]], who applied it to the teachings of [[Laelio Sozzini]] and the Polish [[Socinians]]. Unitarian churches were formally established in [[Transylvania]] and [[Poland]] (by the [[Socinianism|Socinians]]) in the second half of the 16th century.<ref name=\"Harris\">Harris, MW. Unitarian Universalist Origins: Our Historic Faith</ref> There, the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established (in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568, see [[Edict of Torda]]) under the jurisdiction of [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya|John Sigismund]], king of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania, the only Unitarian monarch. The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity, but also the [[pre-existence of Christ]] as well as, in many cases, [[predestination]] and [[original sin]] as put forward by [[Augustine of Hippo]], and the [[substitutionary atonement]] of Christ developed by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] and John Calvin. There were several different forms of [[Christology]] in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement; ultimately, the dominant Christology became [[psilanthropism]]: that Jesus was a man, but one with a unique relationship to God.\n\n====Britain====\n{{main|History of Unitarianism}}\nInfluenced by the teachings of the Polish [[Socinians]], [[Samuel Clarke]] (1675\u20131729) revised the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', removing the Trinitarian [[Nicene Creed]] and references to [[divinity of Jesus|Jesus as God]].<ref name=Clarke>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanunitarian.org/fisherhistory.htm |title=Chris Fisher, ''A Brief History of Unitarian Christianity'', retrieved July 18, 2008 |publisher=Americanunitarian.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref> [[Theophilus Lindsey]] also revised the ''Book of Common Prayer'' to allow a more tolerant, free Unitarian interpretation. Neither cleric was charged under the [[Blasphemy Act 1697]] that made it an \"offense for any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the [[Holy Trinity]]\". The [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] (1689) gave relief to [[English Dissenters]], but excluded Unitarians. The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the [[Church of England]]. In response, in 1774, Lindsey applied for registration of the [[Essex Street Chapel|Essex House]] as a \"Dissenting place of worship\" with the assistance of [[barrister]] [[John Lee (Attorney-General)|John Lee]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1959_StoryEssexHall.pdf|first=Mortimer|last=Rowe|location=London|publisher=Lindsey Press}}</ref>  On the Sunday following the registration\u2014April 17, 1774\u2014the first true Unitarian congregation discreetly convened in the provisional Essex Street Chapel.

The seventh Principle (adopted in 1985), \"Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part\", and a sixth Source (adopted in 1995), \"Spiritual teachings of earth-centered traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature\" were added to explicitly include members with [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], and [[Pantheism|pantheist]] spiritualities.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.uuworld.org/ideas/articles/3643.shtml?lj\n | title = Shared values: How the UUA's Principles and Purposes were shaped and how they've shaped Unitarian Universalism\n | accessdate = 2007-02-24\n | author = Warren R.

Today, the Unitarian Universalist approach to the [[Bible|Christian Bible]], [[Tanakh|Hebrew Scriptures]], and other sacred works is presented by the UUA:\n{{quotation|While Unitarianism and Universalism both have roots in the Protestant Christian tradition, where the Bible is the sacred text, we now look to additional sources for religious and moral inspiration\u2026. We celebrate the spiritual insights of the world\u2019s religions, recognizing wisdom in many scriptures.\n\nWhen we read scripture in worship, whether it is the [[Bible]], the [[Dhammapada]], or the [[Tao Te-Ching]], we interpret it as a product of its time and its place,\u2026not to be interpreted narrowly or oppressively\u2026<nowiki>[</nowiki>S<nowiki>]</nowiki>cripture is never the only word, or the final word.\n\nFrom the beginning we have trusted in the human capacity to use reason and draw conclusions about religion\u2026 [E]ach of us ultimately chooses what is sacred to us.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Sacred texts in Unitarian Universalism\n |url=https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe/sacred-texts\n |access-date=2017-12-05\n}}</ref>}}\n\nIn short, Unitarian Universalists regard the texts of the world's religions as works of people, worthy of respect, with the intention that people from all religions or spiritual backgrounds live peaceably with one another.\n\n==Worship and practice==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Diversity of practices===\nThe Unitarian belief that reason, and not creed, defines the search for truth, and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally has led to the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths. This is reflected in the wide array of spiritual practices found among Unitarian Universalists today. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist-style meditation groups, Jewish [[Passover Seder|Seder]], [[Yom Kippur]] and Passover dinners, ''[[iftaar]]'' meals (marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims), and Christmas Eve/[[Winter Solstice#Observances|Winter Solstice]] services. Children's and youth's religious education classes teach about the divinity of the world and the sanctity of world religions. One of its more popular curricula, Neighboring Faiths (formerly Church Across the Street), takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a [[Hindu]] temple, a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] or [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue, and a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church.\n\nThere is great variety among Unitarian Universalist congregations, with some favoring particular religious beliefs or forms of worship over others, with many more home to an eclectic mix of beliefs. Regardless of their orientation, most congregations are fairly open to differing beliefs, though not always with various faith traditions represented to the same degree.\n\n===Diversity of congregations===\nThere is a wide variety in how congregations conceive of themselves, calling themselves \"churches\", \"societies\", \"fellowships\", \"congregations\", or eschew the use of any particular descriptor (e.g. \"[http://www.uusanmateo.org Unitarian Universalists of San Mateo]\"). Many use the name \"Unitarian Universalist\", (and a few \"Universalist Unitarian\"), having gradually adopted this formulation since consolidation in 1961. Others use names that reflect their historic roots by keeping the historical designation \"Unitarian\" or \"Universalist\" (e.g. \"[[First Unitarian Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|First Unitarian Church]]\"). A few congregations use neither (e.g. [[Unity Temple]]). For some congregations, the name can be a clue to their theological orientation. For others, avoidance of the word \"church\" indicates a desire to distance itself from traditional Christian theology. Sometimes the use of another term may simply indicate a congregation's lay-led or relatively new status. However, some Unitarian Universalist congregations have grown to appreciate alternative terms such as ''fellowship'' and retained them even though they have grown much larger or lost features sometimes associated with their use (such as, in the case of fellowships, a traditionally lay-led worship model).<ref>See for examples: [http://www.uufellowship.org Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Northern Westchester] and [http://www.uuathensga.org/ Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens].</ref>\n\nAlso of note is that there are many more people who identify as Unitarian Universalist on surveys than those who attend Unitarian Universalist congregations (by a factor of four in a recent survey),<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html Largest Religious Groups in the United States of America] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820080454/http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html |date=2018-08-20 }}, Adherents.com</ref> reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the Unitarian Universalist movement.\n\n===Elevator speeches===\nIn 2004, ''UU World'' magazine asked for contributions of \"[[elevator pitch|elevator speeches]]\" explaining Unitarian Universalism.<ref>''UU World Magazine''.

Conversely, we expect that others should respect our right to our own beliefs. Several UU's then, would likely hold as many different beliefs.

The chalice itself has long been a symbol of liberal religion, and indeed liberal Christianity (the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] also use a chalice as their denomination symbol<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |title=The Chalice \n |accessdate=2012-01-21 \n |publisher=[[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112154823/http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheChalice/tabid/70/Default.aspx \n |archivedate=January 12, 2012 \n}}</ref>). The flaming chalice was initially the logo of the Unitarian Service Committee during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. It was created by Austrian artist [[Hans Deutsch]]. The holy oil burning in it is a symbol of helpfulness and sacrifice.\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/aboutuu/chalice.html\n| title = The History of the Flaming Chalice\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Adapted from the pamphlet \"The Flaming Chalice\" by Daniel D. Hotchkiss\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, other interpretations have been suggested, such as the chalice used by the followers of Czech [[Jan Hus]], which was supposedly reverential of Eastern Orthodox traditions; although Hus's early National Church was intrinsically an evangelical Protestant. In some agnostic historiographies the flaming chalice displayed a vague resemblance to a cross in some stylized representations, relying on the sepulchral traditions of the Hospitallers.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark W.|last=Harris|title=The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism| publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=London}}</ref>   Many Unitarian Universalist congregations light a chalice at the beginning of worship services. Other symbols include an [[Christian cross variants#Modern innovations|off-center cross within a circle]] (a Universalist symbol associated with the Humiliati movement in the 1950s, a group of reformist, liturgically minded clergy seeking to revive Universalism).\n\nOther symbols include a pair of open hands releasing a [[dove]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://archive.uua.org/CONG/chalices/\n| title = UU Chalices and Clip Art\n| accessdate = 2008-04-12\n| author = Steve Bridenbaugh\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]}}</ref>\n\n===Services of worship===\n[[File:UM 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[First Unitarian Society of Madison|Unitarian Meeting House]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Shorewood Hills, Wisconsin]].]]\nReligious services are usually held on Sundays and most closely resemble the form and format of Protestant worship in the Reformed tradition.<ref name=\"Sias\"/> Services at a vast majority of congregations follow a structure that focuses on a sermon or presentation by a minister, a lay leader of the congregation, or an invited speaker.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html\n| title = Common Worship: How and Why; The contribution of Von Ogden Vogt\n| accessdate = 2007-02-24\n| author = Commission on Common Worship\n| year = 1983\n| work = Leading Congregations in Worship: A Guide\n| publisher = [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217132901/http://www.uua.org/worshipweb/commonworship/vogt.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-02-17}}</ref> Sermons may cover a wide range of topics. Since Unitarian Universalists do not recognize a particular text or set of texts as primary or inherently superior, inspiration can be found in many different religious or cultural texts as well as the personal experiences of the minister.\n\nThe service also includes hymn-singing, accompanied by organ, piano, or other available instruments, and possibly led by a song leader or choir. The most recent worship songbook published by the denomination, ''Singing the Journey''<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-499-1|title=Singing the Journey|year=2005}}</ref> contains 75 songs and is a supplement to the older ''Singing the Living Tradition'' which contains readings as well.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=1-55896-260-3|title=Singing the Living Tradition|year=1993}}</ref> Hymns typically sung in Unitarian Universalist services come from a variety of sources\u2014traditional [[hymn tune]]s with new or adapted lyrics, spirituals, folk songs from various cultures, or original compositions by Unitarian Universalist musicians are just a few. Instrumental music is also a common feature of the typical worship service, including preludes, offertory music, postludes, or music for contemplation.\n\nPastoral elements of the service may include a time for sharing Joys and Sorrows/Concerns, where individuals in the congregation are invited to [[Ceremonial use of lights|light a candle]] or say a few words about important events in their personal lives. Many also include a time of [[meditation]] or [[prayer]], led by the minister or service leader, both spoken and silent. Responsive readings and stories for children are also typical. Many congregations also allow for a time at the end of the service, called \"talk back\", where members of the congregation can respond to the sermon with their own insights and questions, or even disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister or invited speaker.\n\nMany Unitarian Universalist congregations no longer observe the Christian symbols of [[baptism]], [[Eucharist|communion]], or [[confirmation]], at least in their traditional forms or under their traditional names. Congregations that continue these practices under their more traditional names are often [[federated congregation|federated church]]es or members of the Council of Christian Churches within the Unitarian Universalist Association (CCCUUA), or may have active chapters associated with the [[Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship]] or similar covenant groups.<ref>[http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm Christians 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108233643/http://www.liveoakuu.org/christian04.htm |date=January 8, 2009 }}</ref> \"Child dedications\" often replace more traditional infant baptisms (such \"dedications\" are sometimes practiced even in \"orthodox\" Christian communities that do not baptize infants for theological reasons).

The \n[[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|second women's rights convention]] was held at the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester|First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York]]. Additionally, four [[President of the United States|Presidents of the United States]] were Unitarians: [[John Adams]], [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Millard Fillmore]], and [[William Howard Taft]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pewforum.org/The-Religious-Affiliations-of-US-Presidents.aspx | title=The Religious Affiliations of U.S. Presidents | publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life | date=January 15, 2009 | accessdate=2013-05-23}}</ref>\n\n===Politics of Unitarian Universalists===\n[[File:Civil marriage is a civil right.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.15|A Unitarian Assembly in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstulou.org/ |title=First Unitarian Church of Louisville |publisher=Firstulou.org |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref>]]\nHistorically, Unitarian Universalists have often been active in political causes, notably the [[civil rights movement]],<ref>Smith, Amanda, [http://www.gainformer.com/files/Unitarian%20Universalists.htm Unitarian Universalist Church Has Rich Civil Rights History]</ref> the [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights movement]],<ref>UUA [https://www.uua.org/lgbtq/witness/policy \"Unitarian Universalist Policy and LGBTQ Issues\"]</ref> the [[social justice]] movement, and the [[feminist movement]].\n\n[[Susan B. Anthony]], a Unitarian and [[Quaker]], was extremely influential in the women's [[suffrage]] movement. Unitarian Universalists and Quakers still share many principles. It is therefore common to see Unitarian Universalists and Quakers working together.\n\nUnitarian Universalists were and are still very involved in the fight to end [[racism]] in the United States. [[John Haynes Holmes]], a Unitarian minister and social activist at The Community Church of New York\u2014Unitarian Universalist were among the founders of both the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909 and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), chairing the latter for a time. [[James J. Reeb]], a minister at [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)|All Souls Church, Unitarian]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] and a member of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], was clubbed in [[Selma, Alabama]] on March 8, 1965, and died two days later of massive head trauma. Two weeks after his death, [[Viola Liuzzo]], a Unitarian Universalist civil rights activist, was murdered by white supremacists after her participation in the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] for voting rights are best known for [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]], which refers to March 7, 1965, the most violent of the three marches.\n\nThe past head of the Unitarian Universalist Association 2001\u20132009, [[William G. Sinkford]], is [[African-American]], making Unitarian Universalism one of the first traditionally white denominations to be headed by a member of a racial minority.<ref>Maxwell, Bill; 11 April 2008; \"Leading the Unitarian Universalist Association, a faith without a creed\"; ''St. Petersburg Times''</ref>\n\nWhile [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political liberals]] make up a clear majority of Unitarian Universalists, the movement aspires to diversity, and officially welcomes congregants regardless of their political views. Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither religious liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics. Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists, politics are decided by individuals, not by congregations or the denomination.\n\nSeveral congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a \"[[Unitarian Universalism and LGBT topics#Welcoming Congregation|Welcoming Congregation]]\": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual & transgender (LGBT) members. Unitarian Universalist ministers perform [[same-sex unions]] and now [[same-sex marriages]] where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church \"to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0DB1539F93AA15755C0A962948260 \"Unitarians Endorse Homosexual Marriages\"], UPI, ''The New York Times'', 29 June 1984.</ref> Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly [[ordained]] as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, [[Arlington Street Church (Boston)|Arlington Street Church]], in Boston, Massachusetts, was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage\u2014\"Standing on the Side of Love\". In 2004 UU minister Debra Haffner of [[The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing]] published ''An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality'' to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the [[District of Columbia]] in [[All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)]]\n\n[[Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness]] engages Unitarian Universalist ministers and other leaders to educate them on [[polyamory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uupa.org|title=UUPA website }}</ref> At the 2015 [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|UUA General Assembly]], the Association's non-discrimination rule was amended to include the category of \"family and relationship structures\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |title=Unitarian Universalist Association: Rule II, Section C-2.3.: Non-discrimination |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103753/http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws/ruleii/section-c-23-non-discrimination |archivedate=2015-05-18}}</ref> the UUA has yet to take specific follow-up action on this, however.\n\nMany congregations are heavily involved in projects and efforts aimed at supporting environmental causes and [[sustainability]].

The [[American Unitarian Conference]] and the [[Christian Universalist Association]] are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today. Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists and heirs of the theological legacy of the original [[American Unitarian Association]] or [[Universalist Church of America]], and they do not wish to be confused with Unitarian Universalists. The [[Unity Church]] is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism.<ref>See [http://www.americanunitarian.org/voicearticle.htm \"Why the American Unitarian Conference Had to Be Formed\"] and [http://www.christianuniversalist.org/articles/unitarian.html \"What Is the Difference between Christian Universalism and Unitarian Universalism?\"]</ref>\n\n===Internal===\n\n====Language of reverence====\nDuring the presidency of William Sinkford, debate within the Unitarian Universalist movement has roiled over his call to return to or create an authentic Unitarian Universalist \"language of reverence.\" Sinkford has suggested that Unitarian Universalists have abandoned traditional religious language, thereby abandoning words with potential power to others who will then dictate their meanings in the public sphere. He has suggested that Unitarian Universalists regain their proper seat at the interfaith table by making this language their own. Others have reacted to this call by believing it to be part of an effort to return Unitarian Universalist congregations to more orthodox Christian worship patterns. Sinkford has denied this, citing the words of Unitarian Universalist humanists as examples of what he means by the \"language of reverence.\" The growth of humanism in Unitarianism was determined by a desire to raise the profile to a universal audience, educating atheists and agnostics in biblical literacy among the wider congregation of Unitarian Universalists, many of whom were born into families that lacked the rigour of a moral catechism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uuworld.org/articles/need-language-reverence|title=Human reverence: The language of reverence is the language of humanity|date=2006-07-31|first=Kendyl L.R.|last=Gibbons|publisher=UU World: Liberal religion and life|accessdate=2017-12-26}}</ref>\nThe debate included the publication of a book by the UUA's [[Beacon Press]] written by former UUA President John Buehrens.<ref>{{cite web|last=Buehrens |first=John A. |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/132/story_13272_1.html |title=Past Unitarian Universalist Association President John A.

It provides interpretative strategies, so that Unitarian Universalists (among others) might be able to engage in public debate about what the Bible says from a liberal religious perspective, rather than relinquishing to religious conservatives, and other more literal interpretations, all control over the book's contents and significance in matters of public and civic import.

Like other [[arbovirus]]es, which are transmitted by mosquitoes, ''yellow fever virus'' is taken up by a female mosquito when it ingests the blood of an infected human or another primate. Viruses reach the stomach of the mosquito, and if the virus concentration is high enough, the virions can infect [[epithelial cell]]s and replicate there. From there, they reach the [[haemocoel]] (the blood system of mosquitoes) and from there the [[salivary gland]]s. When the mosquito next sucks blood, it injects its saliva into the wound, and the virus reaches the bloodstream of the bitten person. [[Transovarial transmission|Transovarial]] and [[transstadial transmission]] of yellow fever virus within ''A. aegypti'', that is, the transmission from a female mosquito to her eggs and then larvae, are indicated. This infection of vectors without a previous blood meal seems to play a role in single, sudden breakouts of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal | authors = Fontenille D, Diallo M, Mondo M, Ndiaye M, Thonnon J | title = First evidence of natural vertical transmission of yellow fever virus in ''Aedes aegypti'', its epidemic vector | journal = Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 533\u20135 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9463659 | doi = 10.1016/S0035-9203(97)90013-4 }}</ref>\n\nThree epidemiologically different infectious cycles occur<ref name=Barr2007/> in which the virus is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans or other primates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infectious Diseases Related to Travel|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/yellow-fever|website=Yellow Book|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=20 March 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320215700/http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/yellow-fever|archivedate=20 March 2016}}</ref> In the \"urban cycle\", only the yellow fever mosquito ''A. aegypti'' is involved. It is well adapted to urban areas, and can also transmit other diseases, including [[Zika fever]], [[dengue fever]], and [[chikungunya]]. The urban cycle is responsible for the major outbreaks of yellow fever that occur in Africa. Except for an outbreak in Bolivia in 1999, this urban cycle no longer exists in South America.\n\nBesides the urban cycle, both in Africa and South America, a [[sylvatic cycle]] (forest or jungle cycle) is present, where ''[[Aedes africanus]]'' (in Africa) or mosquitoes of the genus ''[[Haemagogus]]'' and ''[[Sabethes]]'' (in South America) serve as vectors. In the jungle, the mosquitoes infect mainly nonhuman primates; the disease is mostly asymptomatic in African primates. In South America, the sylvatic cycle is currently the only way humans can become infected, which explains the low incidence of yellow fever cases on the continent. People who become infected in the jungle can carry the virus to urban areas, where ''A. aegypti'' acts as a vector. Because of this sylvatic cycle, yellow fever cannot be eradicated except by eradicating the mosquitoes that serve as vectors.<ref name=Barr2007/>\n\nIn Africa, a third infectious cycle known as \"savannah cycle\" or intermediate cycle, occurs between the jungle and urban cycles. Different mosquitoes of the genus ''Aedes'' are involved.

Mild cases of the disease can only be confirmed virologically. Since mild cases of yellow fever can also contribute significantly to regional outbreaks, every suspected case of yellow fever (involving symptoms of fever, pain, nausea, and vomiting 6\u201310 days after leaving the affected area) is treated seriously.\n\nIf yellow fever is suspected, the virus cannot be confirmed until 6\u201310 days following the illness. A direct confirmation can be obtained by [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]], where the genome of the virus is amplified.<ref name=Toll2009/> Another direct approach is the isolation of the virus and its growth in cell culture using [[blood plasma]]; this can take 1\u20134 weeks.\n\nSerologically, an [[ELISA|enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] during the acute phase of the disease using specific [[IgM]] against yellow fever or an increase in specific [[IgG]] [[titer]] (compared to an earlier sample) can confirm yellow fever. Together with clinical symptoms, the detection of IgM or a four-fold increase in IgG titer is considered sufficient indication for yellow fever. As these tests can cross-react with other flaviviruses, such as [[dengue virus]], these indirect methods cannot conclusively prove yellow fever infection.\n\nLiver [[biopsy]] can verify [[inflammation]] and [[necrosis]] of hepatocytes and detect viral [[antigen]]s. Because of the bleeding tendency of yellow fever patients, a biopsy is only advisable ''post mortem'' to confirm the cause of death.\n\nIn a [[differential diagnosis]], infections with yellow fever must be distinguished from other feverish illnesses such as [[malaria]]. Other [[viral hemorrhagic fever]]s, such as [[Ebola virus]], [[Lassa virus]], [[Marburg virus]], and [[Junin virus]], must be excluded as the cause.\n\n==Prevention==\nPersonal prevention of yellow fever includes vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites in areas where yellow fever is endemic. Institutional measures for prevention of yellow fever include vaccination programmes and measures to control mosquitoes. Programmes for distribution of mosquito nets for use in homes produce reductions in cases of both malaria and yellow fever. Use of EPA-registered insect repellent is recommended when outdoors. Exposure for even a short time is enough for a potential mosquito bite. Long-sleeved clothing, long pants, and socks are useful for prevention. The application of larvicides to water-storage containers can help eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites. EPA-registered insecticide spray decreases the transmission of yellow fever.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/prevention/|title=Prevention {{!}} Yellow Fever {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-10-26|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026165250/http://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/prevention/|archivedate=2016-10-26}}</ref>\n\n* Use insect repellent when outdoors such as those containing [[DEET]], [[picaridin]], [[ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate]] (IR3535), or [[oil of lemon eucalyptus]] on exposed skin.\n* Wear proper clothing to reduce mosquito bites. When weather permits, wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing, so spraying clothes with repellent containing [[permethrin]] or another EPA-registered repellent gives extra protection. Clothing treated with permethrin is commercially available. Mosquito repellents containing permethrin are not approved for application directly to the skin.\n* The peak biting times for many mosquito species are dusk to dawn. However, ''A. aegypti'', one of the mosquitoes that transmits yellow fever virus, feeds during the daytime. Staying in accommodations with screened or air-conditioned rooms, particularly during peak biting times, also reduces the risk of mosquito bites.\n\n===Vaccination===\n[[File:Yellow fever certificate.JPG|thumb|The [[Carte Jaune|cover of a certificate]] that confirms the holder has been vaccinated against yellow fever]]\n{{Main|Yellow fever vaccine}}\n[[Vaccination]] is recommended for those traveling to affected areas, because non-native people tend to develop more severe illness when infected.

The disease does not yet occur in Asia. To prevent introduction of the virus, some countries demand previous vaccination of foreign visitors who have passed through yellow fever areas. Vaccination has to be proved by a vaccination certificate, which is valid 10 days after the vaccination and lasts for 10 years. Although the WHO on 17 May 2013 advised that subsequent booster vaccinations are unnecessary, an older (than 10 years) certificate may not be acceptable at all border posts in all affected countries.  A list of the countries that require yellow fever vaccination is published by the WHO.<ref name=\"urlwww.who.int\">{{cite web |url         = http://www.who.int/ith/ITH_country_list.pdf |title       = Country list: Yellow fever vaccination requirements and recommendations; malaria situation; and other vaccination requirements |year        = 2013 |publisher   = WHO |page        = 32 |accessdate  = 2015-04-12 |url-status     = live |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150405160357/http://www.who.int/ith/ITH_country_list.pdf |archivedate = 2015-04-05 }}</ref> If the vaccination cannot be given for some reason, dispensation may be possible. In this case, an exemption certificate issued by a WHO-approved vaccination center is required. Although 32 of 44 countries where yellow fever occurs endemically do have vaccination programmes, in many of these countries, less than 50% of their population is vaccinated.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\n===Vector control===\n[[File:Luchemos todos contra el dengue.jpg|thumb|left|Information campaign for prevention of [[dengue]] and yellow fever in [[Paraguay]]]]\nControl of the yellow fever mosquito ''A. aegypti'' is of major importance, especially because the same mosquito can also transmit dengue fever and [[chikungunya]] disease. ''A. aegypti'' breeds preferentially in water, for example, in installations by inhabitants of areas with precarious drinking water supplies, or in domestic refuse, especially tires, cans, and plastic bottles. These conditions are common in urban areas in developing countries.\n\nTwo main strategies are employed to reduce ''A. aegypti'' populations. One approach is to kill the developing larvae. Measures are taken to reduce the water accumulations in which the larvae develop. [[Larvicide]]s are used, along with larvae-eating fish and [[copepod]]s, which reduce the number of larvae. For many years, copepods of the genus ''[[Mesocyclops]]'' have been used in [[Vietnam]] for preventing dengue fever. This eradicated the mosquito vector in several areas. Similar efforts may prove effective against yellow fever. [[Pyriproxyfen]] is recommended as a chemical larvicide, mainly because it is safe for humans and effective in small doses.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\nThe second strategy is to reduce populations of the adult yellow fever mosquito. [[Lethal ovitrap]]s can reduce ''Aedes'' populations, using lesser amounts of pesticide because it targets the pest directly. Curtains and lids of water tanks can be sprayed with insecticides, but application inside houses is not recommended by the WHO. Insecticide-treated [[mosquito net]]s are effective, just as they are against the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito that carries malaria.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\n==Treatment==\nAs with other ''Flavivirus'' infections, no cure is known for yellow fever. Hospitalization is advisable and intensive care may be necessary because of rapid deterioration in some cases. Certain acute treatment methods lack efficacy: [[passive immunization]] after the emergence of symptoms is probably without effect; [[ribavirin]] and other [[antiviral drug]]s, as well as treatment with [[interferon]]s, are ineffective in yellow fever patients.<ref name=\"pmid18061688\"/> Symptomatic treatment includes rehydration and pain relief with drugs such as [[paracetamol]]. [[Acetylsalicylic acid]] should not be given because of its anticoagulant effect, which can be devastating in the case of internal bleeding that may occur with yellow fever.{{according to|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Epidemiology==\nYellow fever is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|common]] in tropical and subtropical areas of South America and Africa. Worldwide, about 600 million people live in endemic areas. The WHO estimates 200,000 cases of disease and 30,000 deaths a year occur. But the number of officially reported cases is far lower.\n\n===Africa===\n[[File:Yellow fever Africa 2009.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|Areas with risk of yellow fever in Africa (2017)]]\nAn estimated 90% of yellow fever infections occur on the African continent.<ref name=Toll2009/> In 2016, [[2016 Angola and DR Congo yellow fever outbreak|a large outbreak originated in Angola]] and spread to neighboring countries before being contained by a massive vaccination campaign.

Beginning in 1903, the campaign led by [[Oswaldo Cruz]], then director general of public health, resulted not only in eradicating the disease but also in reshaping the physical landscape of Brazilian cities such as Rio de Janeiro. During rainy seasons, Rio de Janeiro had regularly suffered floods, as water from the bay surrounding the city overflowed into Rio's narrow streets. Coupled with the poor drainage systems found throughout Rio, this created swampy conditions in the city's neighborhoods. Pools of stagnant water stood year-long in city streets and proved to be a fertile ground for disease-carrying mosquitoes. Thus, under Cruz's direction, public health units known as \"mosquito inspectors\" fiercely worked to combat yellow fever throughout Rio by spraying, exterminating rats, improving drainage, and destroying unsanitary housing. Ultimately, the city's sanitation and renovation campaigns reshaped Rio de Janeiro's neighborhoods. Its poor residents were pushed from city centers to Rio's suburbs, or to towns found in the outskirts of the city.

It is well adapted to urban areas, and can also transmit other diseases, including [[Zika fever]], [[dengue fever]], and [[chikungunya]]. The urban cycle is responsible for the major outbreaks of yellow fever that occur in Africa. Except for an outbreak in Bolivia in 1999, this urban cycle no longer exists in South America.\n\nBesides the urban cycle, both in Africa and South America, a [[sylvatic cycle]] (forest or jungle cycle) is present, where ''[[Aedes africanus]]'' (in Africa) or mosquitoes of the genus ''[[Haemagogus]]'' and ''[[Sabethes]]'' (in South America) serve as vectors. In the jungle, the mosquitoes infect mainly nonhuman primates; the disease is mostly asymptomatic in African primates. In South America, the sylvatic cycle is currently the only way humans can become infected, which explains the low incidence of yellow fever cases on the continent. People who become infected in the jungle can carry the virus to urban areas, where ''A. aegypti'' acts as a vector. Because of this sylvatic cycle, yellow fever cannot be eradicated except by eradicating the mosquitoes that serve as vectors.<ref name=Barr2007/>\n\nIn Africa, a third infectious cycle known as \"savannah cycle\" or intermediate cycle, occurs between the jungle and urban cycles. Different mosquitoes of the genus ''Aedes'' are involved. In recent years, this has been the most common form of transmission of yellow fever in Africa.<ref name=\"WHO_2001\">{{cite web |title=Yellow fever fact sheet |work=WHO\u2014Yellow fever |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs100/en/ |accessdate=2006-04-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418004055/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs100/en/ |archivedate=2006-04-18 }}</ref>\n\nConcern exists about yellow fever spreading to southeast Asia, where its vector ''A. aegypti'' already occurs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ebola outbreak Alert and response operations Diseases Biorisk reduction Yellow fever : a current threat|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/yellowfev/impact1/en/|website=WHO|accessdate=4 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808215707/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/yellowfev/impact1/en/|archivedate=8 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\nAfter transmission from a mosquito, the viruses replicate in the [[lymph node]]s and infect [[dendritic cell]]s in particular. From there, they reach the liver and infect [[hepatocyte]]s (probably indirectly via [[Kupffer cell]]s), which leads to [[Eosinophil granulocyte|eosinophilic degradation]] of these cells and to the release of [[cytokine]]s.

Mild cases of the disease can only be confirmed virologically. Since mild cases of yellow fever can also contribute significantly to regional outbreaks, every suspected case of yellow fever (involving symptoms of fever, pain, nausea, and vomiting 6\u201310 days after leaving the affected area) is treated seriously.\n\nIf yellow fever is suspected, the virus cannot be confirmed until 6\u201310 days following the illness. A direct confirmation can be obtained by [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]], where the genome of the virus is amplified.<ref name=Toll2009/> Another direct approach is the isolation of the virus and its growth in cell culture using [[blood plasma]]; this can take 1\u20134 weeks.\n\nSerologically, an [[ELISA|enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] during the acute phase of the disease using specific [[IgM]] against yellow fever or an increase in specific [[IgG]] [[titer]] (compared to an earlier sample) can confirm yellow fever. Together with clinical symptoms, the detection of IgM or a four-fold increase in IgG titer is considered sufficient indication for yellow fever. As these tests can cross-react with other flaviviruses, such as [[dengue virus]], these indirect methods cannot conclusively prove yellow fever infection.\n\nLiver [[biopsy]] can verify [[inflammation]] and [[necrosis]] of hepatocytes and detect viral [[antigen]]s. Because of the bleeding tendency of yellow fever patients, a biopsy is only advisable ''post mortem'' to confirm the cause of death.\n\nIn a [[differential diagnosis]], infections with yellow fever must be distinguished from other feverish illnesses such as [[malaria]]. Other [[viral hemorrhagic fever]]s, such as [[Ebola virus]], [[Lassa virus]], [[Marburg virus]], and [[Junin virus]], must be excluded as the cause.\n\n==Prevention==\nPersonal prevention of yellow fever includes vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites in areas where yellow fever is endemic. Institutional measures for prevention of yellow fever include vaccination programmes and measures to control mosquitoes. Programmes for distribution of mosquito nets for use in homes produce reductions in cases of both malaria and yellow fever. Use of EPA-registered insect repellent is recommended when outdoors. Exposure for even a short time is enough for a potential mosquito bite. Long-sleeved clothing, long pants, and socks are useful for prevention. The application of larvicides to water-storage containers can help eliminate potential mosquito breeding sites. EPA-registered insecticide spray decreases the transmission of yellow fever.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/prevention/|title=Prevention {{!}} Yellow Fever {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-10-26|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026165250/http://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/prevention/|archivedate=2016-10-26}}</ref>\n\n* Use insect repellent when outdoors such as those containing [[DEET]], [[picaridin]], [[ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate]] (IR3535), or [[oil of lemon eucalyptus]] on exposed skin.\n* Wear proper clothing to reduce mosquito bites. When weather permits, wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing, so spraying clothes with repellent containing [[permethrin]] or another EPA-registered repellent gives extra protection. Clothing treated with permethrin is commercially available. Mosquito repellents containing permethrin are not approved for application directly to the skin.\n* The peak biting times for many mosquito species are dusk to dawn. However, ''A. aegypti'', one of the mosquitoes that transmits yellow fever virus, feeds during the daytime. Staying in accommodations with screened or air-conditioned rooms, particularly during peak biting times, also reduces the risk of mosquito bites.\n\n===Vaccination===\n[[File:Yellow fever certificate.JPG|thumb|The [[Carte Jaune|cover of a certificate]] that confirms the holder has been vaccinated against yellow fever]]\n{{Main|Yellow fever vaccine}}\n[[Vaccination]] is recommended for those traveling to affected areas, because non-native people tend to develop more severe illness when infected.

Vaccination has to be proved by a vaccination certificate, which is valid 10 days after the vaccination and lasts for 10 years. Although the WHO on 17 May 2013 advised that subsequent booster vaccinations are unnecessary, an older (than 10 years) certificate may not be acceptable at all border posts in all affected countries.

Although 32 of 44 countries where yellow fever occurs endemically do have vaccination programmes, in many of these countries, less than 50% of their population is vaccinated.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\n===Vector control===\n[[File:Luchemos todos contra el dengue.jpg|thumb|left|Information campaign for prevention of [[dengue]] and yellow fever in [[Paraguay]]]]\nControl of the yellow fever mosquito ''A. aegypti'' is of major importance, especially because the same mosquito can also transmit dengue fever and [[chikungunya]] disease. ''A. aegypti'' breeds preferentially in water, for example, in installations by inhabitants of areas with precarious drinking water supplies, or in domestic refuse, especially tires, cans, and plastic bottles. These conditions are common in urban areas in developing countries.\n\nTwo main strategies are employed to reduce ''A. aegypti'' populations. One approach is to kill the developing larvae. Measures are taken to reduce the water accumulations in which the larvae develop. [[Larvicide]]s are used, along with larvae-eating fish and [[copepod]]s, which reduce the number of larvae. For many years, copepods of the genus ''[[Mesocyclops]]'' have been used in [[Vietnam]] for preventing dengue fever. This eradicated the mosquito vector in several areas. Similar efforts may prove effective against yellow fever. [[Pyriproxyfen]] is recommended as a chemical larvicide, mainly because it is safe for humans and effective in small doses.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\nThe second strategy is to reduce populations of the adult yellow fever mosquito. [[Lethal ovitrap]]s can reduce ''Aedes'' populations, using lesser amounts of pesticide because it targets the pest directly. Curtains and lids of water tanks can be sprayed with insecticides, but application inside houses is not recommended by the WHO. Insecticide-treated [[mosquito net]]s are effective, just as they are against the ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquito that carries malaria.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\n==Treatment==\nAs with other ''Flavivirus'' infections, no cure is known for yellow fever. Hospitalization is advisable and intensive care may be necessary because of rapid deterioration in some cases. Certain acute treatment methods lack efficacy: [[passive immunization]] after the emergence of symptoms is probably without effect; [[ribavirin]] and other [[antiviral drug]]s, as well as treatment with [[interferon]]s, are ineffective in yellow fever patients.<ref name=\"pmid18061688\"/> Symptomatic treatment includes rehydration and pain relief with drugs such as [[paracetamol]]. [[Acetylsalicylic acid]] should not be given because of its anticoagulant effect, which can be devastating in the case of internal bleeding that may occur with yellow fever.{{according to|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Epidemiology==\nYellow fever is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|common]] in tropical and subtropical areas of South America and Africa. Worldwide, about 600 million people live in endemic areas. The WHO estimates 200,000 cases of disease and 30,000 deaths a year occur.

Beginning in 1903, the campaign led by [[Oswaldo Cruz]], then director general of public health, resulted not only in eradicating the disease but also in reshaping the physical landscape of Brazilian cities such as Rio de Janeiro. During rainy seasons, Rio de Janeiro had regularly suffered floods, as water from the bay surrounding the city overflowed into Rio's narrow streets. Coupled with the poor drainage systems found throughout Rio, this created swampy conditions in the city's neighborhoods. Pools of stagnant water stood year-long in city streets and proved to be a fertile ground for disease-carrying mosquitoes. Thus, under Cruz's direction, public health units known as \"mosquito inspectors\" fiercely worked to combat yellow fever throughout Rio by spraying, exterminating rats, improving drainage, and destroying unsanitary housing. Ultimately, the city's sanitation and renovation campaigns reshaped Rio de Janeiro's neighborhoods. Its poor residents were pushed from city centers to Rio's suburbs, or to towns found in the outskirts of the city. In later years, Rio's most impoverished inhabitants would come to reside in ''favelas''.<ref>Teresa A. Meade, ''A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 To The Present, 1st ed.''

Since 1943, only a single urban outbreak in [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], [[Bolivia]], has occurred. Since the 1980s, however, the number of yellow fever cases has been increasing again, and ''A. aegypti'' has returned to the urban centers of South America. This is partly due to limitations on available insecticides, as well as habitat dislocations caused by climate change. It is also because the vector control program was abandoned. Although no new urban cycle has yet been established, scientists believe this could happen again at any point. An outbreak in [[Paraguay]] in 2008 was thought to be urban in nature, but this ultimately proved not to be the case.<ref name=Toll2009/>\n\nIn Africa, virus eradication programs have mostly relied upon vaccination.

She has not met the man prior to the wedding. However, on the wedding night, Kajal discovers that the man is actually a mentally challenged person who has the mind of an eight year old. She realises that she has been tricked into marrying him by her in-laws. This makes her furious. Kajal wants to tell her mother, but she cannot because her mother is a heart patient. Kajal is unwilling to accept this marriage and blames her in-laws for ruining her life. Neeraj is innocent and childlike. Kajal finds it hard to tolerate his behaviour, because of which their relationship has quite a turbulent start. After spending some time together, however, Kajal and Neeraj become close. Kajal's mother finds out about the situation and forces Kajal to come back home. Neeraj panics since he can't stay without Kajal, who also doesn't want to leave him. Kajal's mother files a case against Neeraj's family. But, Kajal refuses to leave Neeraj. This strengthens their bond. Kajal comes back and starts her mission to cure Neeraj. She consults a specialist doctor who assists her in treating Neeraj. Gradually, Kajal becomes suspicious that someone in the family doesn't want Neeraj to get cured, but she isn't sure who the person is since everyone seems to love Neeraj a lot. Neeraj's doctor advises Kajal to take Neeraj to a medical camp which could help cure him. Kajal and Neeraj go, although Neeraj's father opposes the idea. When they come back, everyone is surprised at how much Neeraj has improved. All is going well, until on Neeraj's birthday, someone attacks him and he gets hurt on his head. This causes him to regress back into his earlier condition. Kajal is shattered, yet, she refuses to give up hope. She takes Neeraj to the United States for treatment. When they return, Neeraj is fully recovered. He is able to attend office, make his own decisions and understand everything. Kajal and Neeraj are able to live their marital life properly, and express their love to each other. Kajal becomes pregnant, because of which everyone is overjoyed. However, some misunderstandings occur between Kajal and Neeraj, which leads to them having an argument. Kajal has an accident and loses her child. She also loses her memory partially. Soon, it is revealed that Kajal was only pretending to have lost her memory to protect herself from the person who was responsible for Neeraj's condition. That person is Neeraj's mother, who is actually his stepmother. She was the person who killed Neeraj's grandfather, and made him mentally unstable. The reason behind all of this was the fact that Neeraj is the heir to all of his grandfather's property, which his stepmother wanted for herself and her real children. Neeraj's stepmother dies as a result of poisoning, and so does his father. A few years later, Kajal and Neeraj are shown talking to each other about their lives. Neeraj thanks Kajal for supporting him and never giving up on him. They also have a daughter, who they named Asha. The show concludes on a happy note that everything is fine now, all because of Kajal's efforts (koshish).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandhya Mridul]] as Kaajal\n* [[Varun Badola]] as Neeraj\n* [[Jaya Bhattacharya]] as Suniti\n* [[Anupam Bhattacharya]] as Sudhir\n* [[Savita Prabhune]] as Rekha\n* [[Prachi Shah]] as Bhavana\n* [[Shubhangi Gokhale]] as Kaajal's mother\n* Rajesh Tandon as Ishaan\n* [[Uday Tikekar]] as Niraj's father\n* [[Shital Thakkar]] as Kaajal's sister\n* [[Aditi Pratap]] as Niraj's sister\n* [[Shweta Kawatra]]\n* Sai Ballal\n* Mirza Zohaib Alam\n* [[Suchita Trivedi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n*[http://www.rajshri.com/zee/koshish/index.asp?Page=12 Watch online]\n\n{{Zee TV Programmes}}\n{{Balaji Telefilms}}\n\n[[Category:Balaji Telefilms television series]]\n[[Category:Indian television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Zee TV television series]]\n[[Category:2000 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2002 Indian television series endings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Indian English|date=May 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2015}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2012}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Koshish - Ek Aashaa\n| image                = Koshish (TV series).jpg\n| picture_format       = [[480i]] \n| runtime              = approx. 22 minutes\n| creator              = [[Balaji Telefilms]]<br />[[Endemol India]]\n| writer               = '''Story & Screenplay'''<br />R M Joshi, Vipul Mehta, Bhavin Patel & Mahesh Pandey<br />'''Dialogues'''<br />Sunjoy Shekhar \n| director             = [[Anurag Basu]]<br/>Hemant Prabhu\n| editor               = Dharmesh Shah, Vinay Malu, Sandeep Dharne\n| cinematography       = Sanjay Memane\n| producer             = [[Ekta Kapoor]]<br/>[[Shobha Kapoor]]\n| starring             = Sandhya Mridul, Varun Badola\n| opentheme            = \"Woh Aashaa Hai\"\n| composer          = Lalit Sen\n| country              = India\n| network              = [[Zee TV]]\n| first_aired          = February 2000\n| last_aired           = April 2002\n| num_episodes         = 117\n}}\n\n'''''Koshish - Ek Aashaa''''' is an [[India]]n [[soap opera]] that aired on [[Zee TV]] from 2000-2002.
