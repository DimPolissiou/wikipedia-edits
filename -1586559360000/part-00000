Simon]] formulated one of the first models of heuristics, known as [[satisficing]]. His more general research program posed the question of how humans make decisions when the conditions for [[rational choice theory]] are not met, that is how people decide under uncertainty.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Herbert A.|date=1989|title=The Scientist as Problem Solver.|journal=|location=Fort Belvoir, VA|volume=|pages=|doi=10.21236/ada240569}}</ref> Simon is also known as the father of [[bounded rationality]], which he understood as the study of the match (or mismatch) between heuristics and decision environments. This program was later extended into the study of [[ecological rationality]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, psychologists [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] took a different approach, linking heuristics to cognitive biases. Their typical experimental setup consisted of a rule of logic or probability, embedded in a verbal description of a judgement problem, and demonstrated that people's intuitive judgement deviated from the rule. The \"Linda problem\" below gives an example. The deviation is then explained by a heuristic. This research, called the heuristics-and-biases program, challenged the idea that human beings are rational actors and first gained worldwide attention in 1974 with the ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' paper \"[[#CITEREFTverskyKahneman1974|Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases]]\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=D.|date=1974|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|pages=1124\u20131131|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17835457|bibcode=1974Sci...185.1124T}}</ref>  and although the originally proposed heuristics have been challenged in the further debate,<ref name=\"Gigerenzer1996\">{{cite journal|last1=Gigerenzer|first1=G.|year=1996|title=On narrow norms and vague heuristics: A reply to Kahneman and Tversky|journal=[[Psychological Review]]|volume=103|issue=3|pages=592\u2013596|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.592}}</ref> this research program has changed the field by permanently setting the research questions.<ref name=\"FiedlerSydow2015\">{{cite book|title=Cognitive Psychology: Revising the Classical Studies|last1=Fiedler|first1=Klaus|last2=von Sydow|first2=Momme|date=2015|publisher=Sage, London|isbn=978-1-4462-9447-5|editor-last1=Eysenck|editor-first1=Michael W.|pages=146\u2013161|chapter=Heuristics and Biases: Beyond Tversky and Kahneman's (1974) Judgment under Uncertainty|editor-last2=Groome|editor-first2=David|chapterurl=http://crisp.psi.uni-heidelberg.de/sites/default/files/vonSydow/Fiedler__von_Sydow_2015_Heuristic_and_biases_Beyond_Tversky__Kahneman_s_1974_In__Eysenck_Groome_Ch_12.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe original ideas by Herbert Simon were taken up in the 1990s by [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and others.

If one has heard of Roddick but not of Robredo, the recognition heuristic leads to the prediction that Roddick will win. The recognition heuristic exploits partial ignorance, if one has heard of both or no player, a different strategy is needed. Studies of Wimbledon 2003 and 2005 have shown that the recognition heuristic applied by semi-ignorant amateur players predicted the outcomes of all gentlemen single games as well and better than the seedings of the Wimbledon experts (who had heard of all players), as well as the ATP rankings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Serwe|first=Sascha|last2=Frings|first2=Christian|date=2006|title=Who will win Wimbledon?

It is called a \u201ctree\u201d because it can be represented like a decision tree in which one asks a sequence of questions. Unlike a full decision tree, however, it is an incomplete tree \u2013 to save time and reduce the danger of overfitting.\n\nFigure 1 shows a fast-and-frugal tree used for screening for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Just like take-the-best, the tree has a search rule, stopping rule, and decision rule:\n\n''Search rule'': Search through cues in a specified order.\n''Stopping rule'': Stop search if an exit is reached.\n''Decision rule'': Classify the person according to the exit (here: No HIV or HIV).\n\nIn the HIV tree, an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test is conducted first. If the outcome is negative, then the testing procedure stops and the client is informed of the good news, that is, \u201cno HIV.\u201d If, however, the result is positive, a second ELISA test is performed, preferably from a different manufacturer. If the second ELISA is negative, then the procedure stops and the client is informed of having \u201cno HIV.\u201d However, if the result is positive, a final test, the Western blot, is conducted.\n\n[[File:Fast-and-frugal-p1.jpg|thumb|Figure 1: Screening for HIV in the general public follows the logic of a fast-and-frugal tree. If the first enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) is negative, the diagnosis is \u201cno HIV.\u201d If not, a second ELISA is performed; if it is negative, the diagnosis is \u201cno HIV.\u201d Otherwise, a Western blot test is performed, which determines the final classification]]\n\nIn general, for n binary cues, a fast-and-frugal tree has exactly n + 1 exits \u2013 one for each cue and two for the final cue. A full decision tree, in contrast, requires 2<sup>n</sup> exits. The order of cues (tests) in a fast-and-frugal tree is determined by the sensitivity and specificity of the cues, or by other considerations such as the costs of the tests. In the case of the HIV tree, the ELISA is ranked first because it produces fewer misses than the Western blot test, and also is less expensive. The Western blot test, in contrast, produces fewer false alarms. In a full tree, in contrast, order does not matter for the accuracy of the classifications.\n\nFast-and-frugal trees are descriptive or prescriptive models of decision making under uncertainty. For instance, an analysis or court decisions reported that the best model of how London magistrates make bail decisions is a fast and frugal tree.<ref>{{Citation|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.01438|pmid=12661681|title=Psychological Models of Professional Decision Making|journal=Psychological Science|volume=14|issue=2|pages=175\u2013180|year=2003|last1=Dhami|first1=Mandeep K.}}</ref> The HIV tree is both prescriptive\u2013 physicians are taught the procedure \u2013 and a descriptive model, that is, most physicians actually follow the procedure.\n\n==Informal models of heuristics==\n\nIn their initial research, Tversky and Kahneman proposed three heuristics\u2014availability, representativeness, and anchoring and adjustment. Subsequent work has identified many more. Heuristics that underlie judgment are called \"judgment heuristics\". Another type, called \"evaluation heuristics\", are used to judge the desirability of possible choices.<ref>{{harvnb| Hastie|Dawes|2009|pp=210\u2013211}}</ref>\n\n===Availability===\n{{main|Availability heuristic}}\nIn psychology, ''availability'' is the ease with which a particular idea can be brought to mind. When people estimate how likely or how frequent an event is on the basis of its availability, they are using the availability heuristic.<ref name=\"tkavail\">{{Citation|last1=Tversky |first1=Amos |last2= Kahneman |first2=Daniel |year=1973 |title=Availability: A Heuristic for Judging Frequency and Probability |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=207\u2013232|issn=0010-0285|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(73)90033-9}}</ref> When an infrequent event can be brought easily and vividly to mind, this heuristic overestimates its likelihood. For example, people overestimate their likelihood of dying in a dramatic event such as a [[tornado]] or [[terrorism]]. Dramatic, violent deaths are usually more highly publicised and therefore have a higher availability.<ref name=\"suther_avail\">{{harvnb|Sutherland|2007|pp=16\u201317}}</ref> On the other hand, common but mundane events are hard to bring to mind, so their likelihoods tend to be underestimated. These include deaths from [[suicide]]s, [[stroke]]s, and [[diabetes]]. This heuristic is one of the reasons why people are more easily swayed by a single, vivid story than by a large body of statistical evidence.<ref name=\"plous_avail\" /> It may also play a role in the appeal of [[Lottery|lotteries]]: to someone buying a ticket, the well-publicised, jubilant winners are more available than the millions of people who have won nothing.<ref name=\"suther_avail\" />\n\nWhen people judge whether more [[English language|English]] words begin with ''T'' or with ''K'' ,  the availability heuristic gives a quick way to answer the question. Words that begin with ''T'' come more readily to mind, and so subjects give a correct answer without counting out large numbers of words. However, this heuristic can also produce errors. When people are asked whether there are more English words with ''K'' in the first position or with ''K'' in the third position, they use the same process. It is easy to think of words that begin with ''K'', such as ''kangaroo'', ''kitchen'', or ''kept''. It is harder to think of words with ''K'' as the third letter, such as ''lake'', or ''acknowledge'', although objectively these are three times more common. This leads people to the incorrect conclusion that ''K'' is more common at the start of words.<ref name=\"tk1974\" >{{harvnb|Tversky|Kahneman|1974}}</ref> In another experiment, subjects heard the names of many celebrities, roughly equal numbers of whom were male and female. The subjects were then asked whether the list of names included more men or more women. When the men in the list were more famous, a great majority of subjects incorrectly thought there were more of them, and vice versa for women. Tversky and Kahneman's interpretation of these results is that judgments of proportion are based on availability, which is higher for the names of better-known people.<ref name=\"tkavail\" />\n\nIn one experiment that occurred before the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 U.S. Presidential election]], some participants were asked to imagine [[Gerald Ford]] winning, while others did the same for a [[Jimmy Carter]] victory.

In one study, subjects were given partial sentences to complete. The words were selected to activate the concept either of hostility or of kindness: a process known as ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]]''. They then had to interpret the behavior of a man described in a short, ambiguous story. Their interpretation was biased towards the emotion they had been primed with: the more priming, the greater the effect.

An individual thing has a high ''representativeness'' for a category if it is very similar to a prototype of that category. When people categorise things on the basis of representativeness, they are using the representativeness heuristic. \"Representative\" is here meant in two different senses: the prototype used for comparison is representative of its category, and representativeness is also a relation between that prototype and the thing being categorised.<ref name=\"tk1974\" /><ref name=\"plous_repres\">{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=109\u2013120}}</ref> While it is effective for some problems, this heuristic involves attending to the particular characteristics of the individual, ignoring how common those categories are in the population (called the ''base rates''). Thus, people can overestimate the likelihood that something has a very rare property, or underestimate the likelihood of a very common property. This is called the [[base rate fallacy]]. Representativeness explains this and several other ways in which human judgments break the laws of probability.<ref name=\"tk1974\" />\n\nThe representativeness heuristic is also an explanation of how people judge cause and effect: when they make these judgements on the basis of similarity, they are also said to be using the representativeness heuristic. This can lead to a bias, incorrectly finding causal relationships between things that resemble one another and missing them when the cause and effect are very different. Examples of this include both the belief that \"emotionally relevant events ought to have emotionally relevant causes\", and magical [[associative thinking]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Richard E.|last1= Nisbett |last2= Ross|first2=Lee|title=Human inference: strategies and shortcomings of social judgment|url=https://archive.org/details/humaninferencest0000nisb|url-access=registration|year=1980|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|isbn=9780134450735|pages=[https://archive.org/details/humaninferencest0000nisb/page/115 115\u2013118]}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Gilovich|first=Thomas|title=Like Goes with Like: The Role of Representativeness in Erroneous and Pseudo-Scientific Beliefs|date=2002-07-08|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/CBO9780511808098A046/type/book_part|work=Heuristics and Biases|pages=617\u2013624|editor-last=Gilovich|editor-first=Thomas|edition=1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511808098.036.|isbn=978-0-521-79260-8|access-date=2020-04-10|last2=Savitsky|first2=Kenneth|editor2-last=Griffin|editor2-first=Dale|editor3-last=Kahneman|editor3-first=Daniel}}</ref>\n\n====of base rates====\n{{main|Base rate fallacy}}\nA 1973 experiment used a psychological profile of Tom W., a fictional graduate student.<ref name=\"ktprediction\">{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |author2=Amos Tversky |date=July 1973 |title=On the Psychology of Prediction |journal=Psychological Review |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=237\u2013251 |issn= 0033-295X |doi=10.1037/h0034747}}</ref> One group of subjects had to rate Tom's similarity to a typical student in each of nine academic areas (including Law, Engineering and Library Science). Another group had to rate how likely it is that Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by probability, then they should resemble the [[base rates]], i.e. the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). If people based their judgments on probability, they would say that Tom is more likely to study Humanities than Library Science, because there are many more Humanities students, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.<ref name=\"ktprediction\" />\n\n====Conjunction fallacy====\n{{main|Conjunction fallacy}}\nWhen people rely on representativeness, they can fall into an error which breaks a fundamental law of [[probability]].<ref name=\"plous_repres\" /> Tversky and Kahneman gave subjects a short character sketch of a woman called Linda, describing her as, \"31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations\". People reading this description then ranked the likelihood of different statements about Linda. Amongst others, these included \"Linda is a bank teller\", and, \"Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement\". People showed a strong tendency to rate the latter, more specific statement as more likely, even though a conjunction of the form \"Linda is both ''X'' and ''Y''\" can never be more probable than the more general statement \"Linda is ''X''\". The explanation in terms of heuristics is that the judgment was distorted because, for the readers, the character sketch was representative of the sort of person who might be an active feminist but not of someone who works in a bank. A similar exercise concerned Bill, described as \"intelligent but unimaginative\". A great majority of people reading this character sketch rated \"Bill is an accountant who plays jazz for a hobby\", as more likely than \"Bill plays jazz for a hobby\".<ref name=\"tkconjunction\">{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|author2=Kahneman, Daniel|title=Extensional versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgment.|journal=Psychological Review|year=1983|volume=90|issue=4|pages=293\u2013315|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.90.4.293}}  reprinted in {{Citation |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment|editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-last=Gilovich |editor2-first= Dale |editor2-last=Griffin |editor3-first= Daniel |editor3-last=Kahneman |publisher =Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=19\u201348  |isbn=9780521796798 |oclc=47364085}}</ref>\n\nWithout success, Tversky and Kahneman used what they described as \"a series of increasingly desperate manipulations\" to get their subjects to recognise the logical error.

Imagining for simplicity that exactly half of the babies born in a hospital are male, the ratio will not be exactly half in every time period. On some days, more girls will be born and on others, more boys. The question was, does the likelihood of deviating from exactly half depend on whether there are many or few births per day? It is a well-established consequence of [[sampling (statistics)|sampling theory]] that proportions will vary much more day-to-day when the typical number of births per day is small. However, people's answers to the problem do not reflect this fact. They typically reply that the number of births in the hospital makes no difference to the likelihood of more than 60% male babies in one day. The explanation in terms of the heuristic is that people consider only how representative the figure of 60% is of the previously given average of 50%.<ref name=\"tk1974\" /><ref>{{harvnb |Kunda |1999 |pp=70\u201371}}</ref>\n\n====Dilution effect====\n[[Richard E. Nisbett]] and colleagues suggest that representativeness explains the ''dilution effect'', in which irrelevant information weakens the effect of a [[stereotype]]. Subjects in one study were asked whether \"Paul\" or \"Susan\" was more likely to be assertive, given no other information than their first names. They rated Paul as more assertive, apparently basing their judgment on a gender stereotype. Another group, told that Paul's and Susan's mothers each commute to work in a bank, did not show this stereotype effect; they rated Paul and Susan as equally assertive. The explanation is that the additional information about Paul and Susan made them less representative of men or women in general, and so the subjects' expectations about men and women had a weaker effect.<ref>{{Harvnb |Kunda |1999| pp=68\u201370}}</ref> This means unrelated and non-diagnostic information about certain issue can make relative information less powerful to the issue when people understand the phenomenon.<ref name=\"Zukier1982\">{{cite journal|last1=Zukier|first1=Henry|title=The dilution effect: The role of the correlation and the dispersion of predictor variables in the use of nondiagnostic information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=43|issue=6|year=1982|pages=1163\u20131174|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.6.1163}}</ref>\n\n====Misperception of randomness====\nRepresentativeness explains systematic errors that people make when judging the probability of random events. For example, in a sequence of coin tosses, each of which comes up heads (H) or tails (T), people reliably tend to judge a clearly patterned sequence such as HHHTTT as less likely than a less patterned sequence such as HTHTTH. These sequences have exactly the same probability, but people tend to see the more clearly patterned sequences as less representative of randomness, and so less likely to result from a random process.<ref name=\"tk1974\"/><ref>{{harvnb |Kunda |1999 |pp=71\u201372}}</ref> Tversky and Kahneman argued that this effect underlies the [[gambler's fallacy]]; a tendency to expect outcomes to even out over the short run, like expecting a [[roulette]] wheel to come up black because the last several throws came up red.<ref name=\"plous_repres\" /><ref name=\"smallnumbers\">{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|author2=Kahneman, Daniel|title=Belief in the law of small numbers.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year= 1971|volume=76|issue=2|pages=105\u2013110|doi=10.1037/h0031322|citeseerx=10.1.1.592.3838}} reprinted in {{cite book|editor1=Daniel Kahneman |editor2=Paul Slovic |editor3=Amos Tversky |title=Judgment under uncertainty: heuristics and biases|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521284141|pages=23\u201331}}</ref> They emphasised that even experts in statistics were susceptible to this illusion: in a 1971 survey of professional psychologists, they found that respondents expected samples to be overly representative of the population they were drawn from.

Hence the anchor contaminates the estimate, even if it is clearly irrelevant. In one experiment, subjects watched a number being selected from a spinning \"wheel of fortune\". They had to say whether a given quantity was larger or smaller than that number. For instance, they might be asked, \"Is the percentage of African countries which are members of the [[United Nations]] larger or smaller than 65%?\" They then tried to guess the true percentage. Their answers correlated well with the arbitrary number they had been given.<ref name=baron_anch /><ref name=plous_anch />  Insufficient adjustment from an anchor is not the only explanation for this effect. An alternative theory is that people form their estimates on evidence which is selectively brought to mind by the anchor.<ref>{{harvnb |Koehler|Harvey|2004|p=99}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cote de Brouilly bottle of Beaujolais wine.jpg|thumb|160px|The amount of money people will pay in an auction for a bottle of wine can be influenced by considering an arbitrary two-digit number.]]\n\nThe anchoring effect has been demonstrated by a wide variety of experiments both in laboratories and in the real world.<ref name=plous_anch /><ref name=mes197 /> It remains when the subjects are offered money as an incentive to be accurate, or when they are explicitly told not to base their judgment on the anchor.<ref name=\"mes197\">{{Harvnb |Mussweiler|Englich|Strack|2004|pp=185\u2013186, 197}}</ref> The effect is stronger when people have to make their judgments quickly.<ref name=yud_anch /> Subjects in these experiments lack [[introspection|introspective awareness]] of the heuristic, denying that the anchor affected their estimates.<ref name=yud_anch />\n\nEven when the anchor value is obviously random or extreme, it can still contaminate estimates.<ref name=mes197 /> One experiment asked subjects to estimate the year of [[Albert Einstein]]'s first visit to the United States. Anchors of 1215 and 1992 contaminated the answers just as much as more sensible anchor years.<ref name=\"yud_anch\">{{Harvnb |Yudkowsky|2008|pp=102\u2013103}}</ref> Other experiments asked subjects if the average temperature in [[San Francisco]] is more or less than 558 degrees, or whether there had been more or fewer than 100,025 top ten albums by [[The Beatles]].

An example is where people predict the value of a stock market index on a particular day by defining an upper and lower bound so that they are 98% confident the true value will fall in that range. A reliable finding is that people anchor their upper and lower bounds too close to their best estimate.<ref name=\"tk1974\" /> This leads to an [[overconfidence effect]]. One much-replicated finding is that when people are 98% certain that a number is in a particular range, they are wrong about thirty to forty percent of the time.<ref name=tk1974 /><ref name=\"state\">{{citation|last=Lichtenstein |first=Sarah |first2=Baruch |last2=Fischoff|first3= Lawrence D. |last3=Phillips |chapter=Calibration of probabilities: The state of the art to 1980 |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Kahneman| editor2-first=Paul|editor2-last=Slovic |editor3-first=Amos|editor3-last=Tversky |title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1982 |isbn= 9780521284141 |pages=306\u2013334}}</ref>\n\nAnchoring also causes particular difficulty when many numbers are combined into a composite judgment. Tversky and Kahneman demonstrated this by asking a group of people to rapidly estimate the product 8&nbsp;x&nbsp;7&nbsp;x&nbsp;6&nbsp;x&nbsp;5&nbsp;x&nbsp;4&nbsp;x&nbsp;3&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp;x&nbsp;1.

Both groups underestimated the answer by a wide margin, but the latter group's average estimate was significantly smaller.<ref name=suther168 /> The explanation in terms of anchoring is that people multiply the first few terms of each product and anchor on that figure.<ref name=suther168 /> A less abstract task is to estimate the probability that an aircraft will crash, given that there are numerous possible faults each with a likelihood of one in a million. A common finding from studies of these tasks is that people anchor on the small component probabilities and so underestimate the total.<ref name=\"suther168\">{{harvnb|Sutherland|2007|pp=168\u2013170}}</ref> A corresponding effect happens when people estimate the probability of multiple events happening in sequence, such as an [[Parlay (gambling)|accumulator bet]] in horse racing. For this kind of judgment, anchoring on the individual probabilities results in an overestimation of the combined probability.<ref name=suther168 />\n\n====Examples====\nPeople's valuation of goods, and the quantities they buy, respond to anchoring effects. In one experiment, people wrote down the last two digits of their [[social security number]]s. They were then asked to consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items whose value they did not know, such as wine, chocolate, and computer equipment. They then entered an [[auction]] to bid for these items.

In one experiment, 48 teachers were given bundles of student essays, each of which had to be graded and returned. They were also given a fictional list of the students' previous grades. The mean of these grades affected the grades that teachers awarded for the essay.<ref>{{citation |editor1-first=Jean-Paul |editor1-last=Caverni |editor2-first= Jean-Marc |editor2-last=Fabr\u00e9 |editor3-first=Michel |editor3-last=Gonz\u00e1lez |publisher=Elsevier |title=Cognitive biases |year=1990|chapter=The Anchoring-Adjustment Heuristic in an 'Information-Rich, Real World Setting': Knowledge Assessment by Experts | first1=Jean-Paul |last1=Caverni|first2=Jean-Luc |last2=P\u00e9ris|pages=35\u201345|isbn=9780444884138}}</ref>\n\nOne study showed that anchoring affected the sentences in a fictional rape trial.<ref name=\"mes183\" /> The subjects were trial judges with, on average, more than fifteen years of experience. They read documents including witness testimony, expert statements, the relevant penal code, and the final pleas from the prosecution and defence. The two conditions of this experiment differed in just one respect: the prosecutor demanded a 34-month sentence in one condition and 12 months in the other; there was an eight-month difference between the average sentences handed out in these two conditions.<ref name=\"mes183\">{{Harvnb |Mussweiler|Englich|Strack|2004|p=183}}</ref> In a similar mock trial, the subjects took the role of jurors in a civil case.

Although the facts of the case were the same each time, jurors given the higher range decided on an award that was about three times higher. This happened even though the subjects were explicitly warned not to treat the requests as evidence.<ref name=HastieDawes_anch />\n\nAssessments can also be influenced by the stimuli provided.  In one review, researchers found that if a stimulus is perceived to be important or carry \"weight\" to a situation, that people were more likely to attribute that stimulus as heavier physically.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rabelo | first1 = A.

A ''cognitive laziness'' approach argues that heuristics are inevitable shortcuts given the limitations of the human brain. According to the ''natural assessments'' approach, some complex calculations are already done rapidly and automatically by the brain, and other judgments make use of these processes rather than calculating from scratch. This has led to a theory called \"attribute substitution\", which says that people often handle a complicated question by answering a different, related question, without being aware that this is what they are doing.<ref name=revisited /> A third approach argues that heuristics perform just as well as more complicated decision-making procedures, but more quickly and with less information. This perspective emphasises the \"fast and frugal\" nature of heuristics.<ref name=\"Hardman_frugal\">{{harvnb|Hardman|2009|pp=13\u201316}}</ref>\n\n===Cognitive laziness===\n{{See also|Cognitive miser}}\nAn ''effort-reduction framework'' proposed by Anuj K.

Kahneman and Frederick built on this idea, arguing that the target attribute and heuristic attribute could be very different in nature.<ref name=\"revisited\"/>\n\n{{Quote box |quote=[P]eople are not accustomed to thinking hard, and are often content to trust a plausible judgment that comes to mind. |source=[[Daniel Kahneman]], ''American Economic Review'' '''93''' (5) December 2003, p. 1450<ref name=\"kahneman_aer\" /> |width=30% |align=right}}\nKahneman and Frederick propose three conditions for attribute substitution:<ref name=\"revisited\"/>\n# The target attribute is relatively inaccessible.<br />Substitution is not expected to take place in answering factual questions that can be retrieved directly from memory (\"What is your birthday?\") or about current experience (\"Do you feel thirsty now?).\n# An associated attribute is highly accessible.<br />This might be because it is evaluated automatically in normal perception or because it has been [[priming (psychology)|primed]]. For example, someone who has been thinking about their love life and is then asked how happy they are might substitute how happy they are with their love life rather than other areas.\n# The substitution is not detected and corrected by the reflective system.<br />For example, when asked \"A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?\" many subjects incorrectly answer $0.10.<ref name=\"kahneman_aer\"/> An explanation in terms of attribute substitution is that, rather than work out the sum, subjects parse the sum of $1.10 into a large amount and a small amount, which is easy to do. Whether they feel that is the right answer will depend on whether they check the calculation with their reflective system.\n\nKahneman gives an example where some Americans were offered [[insurance]] against their own death in a terrorist attack while on a trip to Europe, while another group were offered insurance that would cover death of any kind on the trip. Even though \"death of any kind\" includes \"death in a terrorist attack\", the former group were willing to pay more than the latter. Kahneman suggests that the attribute of [[fear]] is being substituted for a calculation of the total risks of travel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kahneman07/kahneman07_index.html |title=Short Course in Thinking About Thinking |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |year=2007 |work=Edge.org |publisher=Edge Foundation |accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> Fear of terrorism for these subjects was stronger than a general fear of dying on a foreign trip.\n\n===Fast and frugal===\n[[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and colleagues have argued that heuristics can be used to make judgments that are accurate rather than biased. According to them, heuristics are \"fast and frugal\" alternatives to more complicated procedures, giving answers that are just as good.<ref>Gerd Gigerenzer, Peter M. Todd, and the ABC Research Group (1999). ''Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart''. Oxford, UK, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-514381-7}}</ref> See also [[Fast-and-frugal trees]]\n\n==Consequences==\n\n===Efficient decision heuristics===\nWarren Thorngate, an emeritus social psychologist, implemented 10 simple decision rules or heuristics in a simulation program as computer subroutines chose an alternative. He determined how often each heuristic selected alternatives with highest-through-lowest expected value in a series of randomly generated decision situations. He found that most of the simulated heuristics selected alternatives with highest expected value and almost never selected alternatives with lowest expected value. More information about the simulation can be found in his \"Efficient decision heuristics\" article (1980).<ref name=\"Thorngate1980\">{{cite journal|last1=Thorngate|first1=Warren|title=Efficient decision heuristics|journal=Behavioral Science|volume=25|issue=3|year=1980|pages=219\u2013225|doi=10.1002/bs.3830250306}}</ref>\n\n===\"Beautiful-is-familiar\" effect===\nPsychologist Beno\u00eet Monin reports a series of experiments in which subjects, looking at photographs of faces, have to judge whether they have seen those faces before. It is repeatedly found that attractive faces are more likely to be mistakenly labeled as familiar.<ref>{{Citation |last=Monin |first=Beno\u00eet |author2=Daniel M.

The heuristic attribute in this case is a \"warm glow\"; a positive feeling towards someone that might either be due to their being familiar or being attractive. This interpretation has been criticised, because not all the [[variance]] in familiarity is accounted for by the attractiveness of the photograph.<ref name=\"shah2008\"/>\n\n===Judgments of morality and fairness===\nLegal scholar [[Cass Sunstein]] has argued that attribute substitution is pervasive when people reason about [[morality|moral]], [[political]] or [[legal]] matters.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2005 |title=Moral heuristics |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages= 531\u2013542 |issn=0140-525X |doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000099 |pmid= 16209802}}</ref> Given a difficult, novel problem in these areas, people search for a more familiar, related problem (a \"prototypical case\") and apply its solution as the solution to the harder problem. According to Sunstein, the opinions of trusted political or religious authorities can serve as heuristic attributes when people are asked their own opinions on a matter. Another source of heuristic attributes is [[emotion]]: people's moral opinions on sensitive subjects like [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[human cloning]] may be driven by reactions such as [[disgust]], rather than by reasoned principles.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2009 |title=Some Effects of Moral Indignation on Law |journal=Vermont Law Review |publisher=Vermont Law School |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=405\u2013434 |url= http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/02/12-Sunstein-Book-3-Vol.-33.pdf |ssrn=1401432|accessdate=2009-09-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023946/http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/02/12-Sunstein-Book-3-Vol.-33.pdf|archivedate=November 29, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Sunstein has been challenged as not providing enough evidence that attribute substitution, rather than other processes, is at work in these cases.<ref name=\"shah2008\">{{cite journal |last=Shah |first=Anuj K. |author2=Daniel M.

One without prior knowledge would see the person in the proper pharmaceutical attire and assume that they know what they are talking about. Therefore, that person automatically has more credibility and is more likely to trust the content of the messages than they deliver. While another who is also in that field of work or already has prior knowledge of the medication will not be persuaded by the ad because of their systematic way of thinking.

Since it was the first thought, therefore you value it as better than any other book one could suggest. The effort heuristic is almost identical to fluency. The one distinction would be that objects that take longer to produce are seen with more value. One may conclude that a glass vase is more valuable than a drawing, merely because it may take longer for the vase. These two varieties of heuristics confirms how we may be influenced easily our mental shortcuts, or what may come quickest to our mind.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/646758779|title=The psychology of learning and motivation : advances in research and theory.

Simon]] formulated one of the first models of heuristics, known as [[satisficing]]. His more general research program posed the question of how humans make decisions when the conditions for [[rational choice theory]] are not met, that is how people decide under uncertainty.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Herbert A.|date=1989|title=The Scientist as Problem Solver.|journal=|location=Fort Belvoir, VA|volume=|pages=|doi=10.21236/ada240569}}</ref> Simon is also known as the father of [[bounded rationality]], which he understood as the study of the match (or mismatch) between heuristics and decision environments. This program was later extended into the study of [[ecological rationality]].\n\nIn the early 1970s, psychologists [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] took a different approach, linking heuristics to cognitive biases. Their typical experimental setup consisted of a rule of logic or probability, embedded in a verbal description of a judgement problem, and demonstrated that people's intuitive judgement deviated from the rule. The \"Linda problem\" below gives an example. The deviation is then explained by a heuristic. This research, called the heuristics-and-biases program, challenged the idea that human beings are rational actors and first gained worldwide attention in 1974 with the ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' paper \"[[#CITEREFTverskyKahneman1974|Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases]]\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=D.|date=1974|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|pages=1124\u20131131|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17835457|bibcode=1974Sci...185.1124T}}</ref>  and although the originally proposed heuristics have been challenged in the further debate,<ref name=\"Gigerenzer1996\">{{cite journal|last1=Gigerenzer|first1=G.|year=1996|title=On narrow norms and vague heuristics: A reply to Kahneman and Tversky|journal=[[Psychological Review]]|volume=103|issue=3|pages=592\u2013596|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.592}}</ref> this research program has changed the field by permanently setting the research questions.<ref name=\"FiedlerSydow2015\">{{cite book|title=Cognitive Psychology: Revising the Classical Studies|last1=Fiedler|first1=Klaus|last2=von Sydow|first2=Momme|date=2015|publisher=Sage, London|isbn=978-1-4462-9447-5|editor-last1=Eysenck|editor-first1=Michael W.|pages=146\u2013161|chapter=Heuristics and Biases: Beyond Tversky and Kahneman's (1974) Judgment under Uncertainty|editor-last2=Groome|editor-first2=David|chapterurl=http://crisp.psi.uni-heidelberg.de/sites/default/files/vonSydow/Fiedler__von_Sydow_2015_Heuristic_and_biases_Beyond_Tversky__Kahneman_s_1974_In__Eysenck_Groome_Ch_12.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe original ideas by Herbert Simon were taken up in the 1990s by [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and others.

The recognition heuristic exploits partial ignorance, if one has heard of both or no player, a different strategy is needed.

It is called a \u201ctree\u201d because it can be represented like a decision tree in which one asks a sequence of questions. Unlike a full decision tree, however, it is an incomplete tree \u2013 to save time and reduce the danger of overfitting.\n\nFigure 1 shows a fast-and-frugal tree used for screening for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Just like take-the-best, the tree has a search rule, stopping rule, and decision rule:\n\n''Search rule'': Search through cues in a specified order.\n''Stopping rule'': Stop search if an exit is reached.\n''Decision rule'': Classify the person according to the exit (here: No HIV or HIV).\n\nIn the HIV tree, an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test is conducted first. If the outcome is negative, then the testing procedure stops and the client is informed of the good news, that is, \u201cno HIV.\u201d If, however, the result is positive, a second ELISA test is performed, preferably from a different manufacturer. If the second ELISA is negative, then the procedure stops and the client is informed of having \u201cno HIV.\u201d However, if the result is positive, a final test, the Western blot, is conducted.\n\n[[File:Fast-and-frugal-p1.jpg|thumb|Figure 1: Screening for HIV in the general public follows the logic of a fast-and-frugal tree. If the first enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) is negative, the diagnosis is \u201cno HIV.\u201d If not, a second ELISA is performed; if it is negative, the diagnosis is \u201cno HIV.\u201d Otherwise, a Western blot test is performed, which determines the final classification]]\n\nIn general, for n binary cues, a fast-and-frugal tree has exactly n + 1 exits \u2013 one for each cue and two for the final cue. A full decision tree, in contrast, requires 2<sup>n</sup> exits. The order of cues (tests) in a fast-and-frugal tree is determined by the sensitivity and specificity of the cues, or by other considerations such as the costs of the tests. In the case of the HIV tree, the ELISA is ranked first because it produces fewer misses than the Western blot test, and also is less expensive. The Western blot test, in contrast, produces fewer false alarms. In a full tree, in contrast, order does not matter for the accuracy of the classifications.\n\nFast-and-frugal trees are descriptive or prescriptive models of decision making under uncertainty. For instance, an analysis or court decisions reported that the best model of how London magistrates make bail decisions is a fast and frugal tree.<ref>{{Citation|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.01438|pmid=12661681|title=Psychological Models of Professional Decision Making|journal=Psychological Science|volume=14|issue=2|pages=175\u2013180|year=2003|last1=Dhami|first1=Mandeep K.}}</ref> The HIV tree is both prescriptive\u2013 physicians are taught the procedure \u2013 and a descriptive model, that is, most physicians actually follow the procedure.\n\n==Informal models of heuristics==\n\nIn their initial research, Tversky and Kahneman proposed three heuristics\u2014availability, representativeness, and anchoring and adjustment. Subsequent work has identified many more. Heuristics that underlie judgment are called \"judgment heuristics\". Another type, called \"evaluation heuristics\", are used to judge the desirability of possible choices.<ref>{{harvnb| Hastie|Dawes|2009|pp=210\u2013211}}</ref>\n\n===Availability===\n{{main|Availability heuristic}}\nIn psychology, ''availability'' is the ease with which a particular idea can be brought to mind. When people estimate how likely or how frequent an event is on the basis of its availability, they are using the availability heuristic.<ref name=\"tkavail\">{{Citation|last1=Tversky |first1=Amos |last2= Kahneman |first2=Daniel |year=1973 |title=Availability: A Heuristic for Judging Frequency and Probability |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=207\u2013232|issn=0010-0285|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(73)90033-9}}</ref> When an infrequent event can be brought easily and vividly to mind, this heuristic overestimates its likelihood. For example, people overestimate their likelihood of dying in a dramatic event such as a [[tornado]] or [[terrorism]]. Dramatic, violent deaths are usually more highly publicised and therefore have a higher availability.<ref name=\"suther_avail\">{{harvnb|Sutherland|2007|pp=16\u201317}}</ref> On the other hand, common but mundane events are hard to bring to mind, so their likelihoods tend to be underestimated. These include deaths from [[suicide]]s, [[stroke]]s, and [[diabetes]]. This heuristic is one of the reasons why people are more easily swayed by a single, vivid story than by a large body of statistical evidence.<ref name=\"plous_avail\" /> It may also play a role in the appeal of [[Lottery|lotteries]]: to someone buying a ticket, the well-publicised, jubilant winners are more available than the millions of people who have won nothing.<ref name=\"suther_avail\" />\n\nWhen people judge whether more [[English language|English]] words begin with ''T'' or with ''K'' ,  the availability heuristic gives a quick way to answer the question. Words that begin with ''T'' come more readily to mind, and so subjects give a correct answer without counting out large numbers of words. However, this heuristic can also produce errors. When people are asked whether there are more English words with ''K'' in the first position or with ''K'' in the third position, they use the same process. It is easy to think of words that begin with ''K'', such as ''kangaroo'', ''kitchen'', or ''kept''. It is harder to think of words with ''K'' as the third letter, such as ''lake'', or ''acknowledge'', although objectively these are three times more common. This leads people to the incorrect conclusion that ''K'' is more common at the start of words.<ref name=\"tk1974\" >{{harvnb|Tversky|Kahneman|1974}}</ref> In another experiment, subjects heard the names of many celebrities, roughly equal numbers of whom were male and female. The subjects were then asked whether the list of names included more men or more women. When the men in the list were more famous, a great majority of subjects incorrectly thought there were more of them, and vice versa for women. Tversky and Kahneman's interpretation of these results is that judgments of proportion are based on availability, which is higher for the names of better-known people.<ref name=\"tkavail\" />\n\nIn one experiment that occurred before the [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976 U.S. Presidential election]], some participants were asked to imagine [[Gerald Ford]] winning, while others did the same for a [[Jimmy Carter]] victory. Each group subsequently viewed their allocated candidate as significantly more likely to win. The researchers found a similar effect when students imagined a good or a bad season for a [[college football]] team.<ref name=\"Carroll1978\">{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=J.|title=The Effect of Imagining an Event on Expectations for the Event: An Interpretation in Terms of the Availability Heuristic|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=14|issue=1|year=1978|pages=88\u201396|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(78)90062-8}}</ref> The effect of imagination on subjective likelihood has been replicated by several other researchers.<ref name=\"plous_avail\">{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nA concept's availability can be affected by how recently and how frequently it has been brought to mind. In one study, subjects were given partial sentences to complete. The words were selected to activate the concept either of hostility or of kindness: a process known as ''[[priming (psychology)|priming]]''. They then had to interpret the behavior of a man described in a short, ambiguous story. Their interpretation was biased towards the emotion they had been primed with: the more priming, the greater the effect. A greater interval between the initial task and the judgment decreased the effect.<ref name=\"SrullWyer1979\">{{cite journal|last1=Srull|first1=Thomas K.|last2=Wyer|first2=Robert S.|title=The Role of Category Accessibility in the Interpretation of Information About Persons: Some Determinants and Implications|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=10|year=1979|pages=1660\u20131672|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.37.10.1660|citeseerx=10.1.1.335.4255}}</ref>\n\nTversky and Kahneman offered the availability heuristic as an explanation for [[illusory correlation]]s in which people wrongly judge two events to be associated with each other. They explained that people judge correlation on the basis of the ease of imagining or recalling the two events together.<ref name=\"tkavail\" /><ref name=\"tk1974\" />\n\n===Representativeness===\n{{main|Representativeness heuristic}}\n[[File:Generalization_process_using_trees_PNG_version.png|alt=Diagram|right|thumb|243x243px|Snap judgement of whether novel object fits an existing category]]\nThe representativeness heuristic is seen when people use categories, for example when deciding whether or not a person is a criminal. An individual thing has a high ''representativeness'' for a category if it is very similar to a prototype of that category. When people categorise things on the basis of representativeness, they are using the representativeness heuristic. \"Representative\" is here meant in two different senses: the prototype used for comparison is representative of its category, and representativeness is also a relation between that prototype and the thing being categorised.<ref name=\"tk1974\" /><ref name=\"plous_repres\">{{harvnb |Plous|1993|pp=109\u2013120}}</ref> While it is effective for some problems, this heuristic involves attending to the particular characteristics of the individual, ignoring how common those categories are in the population (called the ''base rates''). Thus, people can overestimate the likelihood that something has a very rare property, or underestimate the likelihood of a very common property. This is called the [[base rate fallacy]]. Representativeness explains this and several other ways in which human judgments break the laws of probability.<ref name=\"tk1974\" />\n\nThe representativeness heuristic is also an explanation of how people judge cause and effect: when they make these judgements on the basis of similarity, they are also said to be using the representativeness heuristic. This can lead to a bias, incorrectly finding causal relationships between things that resemble one another and missing them when the cause and effect are very different. Examples of this include both the belief that \"emotionally relevant events ought to have emotionally relevant causes\", and magical [[associative thinking]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Richard E.|last1= Nisbett |last2= Ross|first2=Lee|title=Human inference: strategies and shortcomings of social judgment|url=https://archive.org/details/humaninferencest0000nisb|url-access=registration|year=1980|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|isbn=9780134450735|pages=[https://archive.org/details/humaninferencest0000nisb/page/115 115\u2013118]}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Gilovich|first=Thomas|title=Like Goes with Like: The Role of Representativeness in Erroneous and Pseudo-Scientific Beliefs|date=2002-07-08|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/CBO9780511808098A046/type/book_part|work=Heuristics and Biases|pages=617\u2013624|editor-last=Gilovich|editor-first=Thomas|edition=1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511808098.036.|isbn=978-0-521-79260-8|access-date=2020-04-10|last2=Savitsky|first2=Kenneth|editor2-last=Griffin|editor2-first=Dale|editor3-last=Kahneman|editor3-first=Daniel}}</ref>\n\n====of base rates====\n{{main|Base rate fallacy}}\nA 1973 experiment used a psychological profile of Tom W., a fictional graduate student.<ref name=\"ktprediction\">{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |author2=Amos Tversky |date=July 1973 |title=On the Psychology of Prediction |journal=Psychological Review |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=237\u2013251 |issn= 0033-295X |doi=10.1037/h0034747}}</ref> One group of subjects had to rate Tom's similarity to a typical student in each of nine academic areas (including Law, Engineering and Library Science). Another group had to rate how likely it is that Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by probability, then they should resemble the [[base rates]], i.e. the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). If people based their judgments on probability, they would say that Tom is more likely to study Humanities than Library Science, because there are many more Humanities students, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.<ref name=\"ktprediction\" />\n\n====Conjunction fallacy====\n{{main|Conjunction fallacy}}\nWhen people rely on representativeness, they can fall into an error which breaks a fundamental law of [[probability]].<ref name=\"plous_repres\" /> Tversky and Kahneman gave subjects a short character sketch of a woman called Linda, describing her as, \"31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations\". People reading this description then ranked the likelihood of different statements about Linda. Amongst others, these included \"Linda is a bank teller\", and, \"Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement\". People showed a strong tendency to rate the latter, more specific statement as more likely, even though a conjunction of the form \"Linda is both ''X'' and ''Y''\" can never be more probable than the more general statement \"Linda is ''X''\". The explanation in terms of heuristics is that the judgment was distorted because, for the readers, the character sketch was representative of the sort of person who might be an active feminist but not of someone who works in a bank. A similar exercise concerned Bill, described as \"intelligent but unimaginative\". A great majority of people reading this character sketch rated \"Bill is an accountant who plays jazz for a hobby\", as more likely than \"Bill plays jazz for a hobby\".<ref name=\"tkconjunction\">{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|author2=Kahneman, Daniel|title=Extensional versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgment.|journal=Psychological Review|year=1983|volume=90|issue=4|pages=293\u2013315|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.90.4.293}}  reprinted in {{Citation |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment|editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-last=Gilovich |editor2-first= Dale |editor2-last=Griffin |editor3-first= Daniel |editor3-last=Kahneman |publisher =Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=19\u201348  |isbn=9780521796798 |oclc=47364085}}</ref>\n\nWithout success, Tversky and Kahneman used what they described as \"a series of increasingly desperate manipulations\" to get their subjects to recognise the logical error.

Imagining for simplicity that exactly half of the babies born in a hospital are male, the ratio will not be exactly half in every time period. On some days, more girls will be born and on others, more boys. The question was, does the likelihood of deviating from exactly half depend on whether there are many or few births per day? It is a well-established consequence of [[sampling (statistics)|sampling theory]] that proportions will vary much more day-to-day when the typical number of births per day is small. However, people's answers to the problem do not reflect this fact. They typically reply that the number of births in the hospital makes no difference to the likelihood of more than 60% male babies in one day. The explanation in terms of the heuristic is that people consider only how representative the figure of 60% is of the previously given average of 50%.<ref name=\"tk1974\" /><ref>{{harvnb |Kunda |1999 |pp=70\u201371}}</ref>\n\n====Dilution effect====\n[[Richard E. Nisbett]] and colleagues suggest that representativeness explains the ''dilution effect'', in which irrelevant information weakens the effect of a [[stereotype]]. Subjects in one study were asked whether \"Paul\" or \"Susan\" was more likely to be assertive, given no other information than their first names. They rated Paul as more assertive, apparently basing their judgment on a gender stereotype. Another group, told that Paul's and Susan's mothers each commute to work in a bank, did not show this stereotype effect; they rated Paul and Susan as equally assertive. The explanation is that the additional information about Paul and Susan made them less representative of men or women in general, and so the subjects' expectations about men and women had a weaker effect.<ref>{{Harvnb |Kunda |1999| pp=68\u201370}}</ref> This means unrelated and non-diagnostic information about certain issue can make relative information less powerful to the issue when people understand the phenomenon.<ref name=\"Zukier1982\">{{cite journal|last1=Zukier|first1=Henry|title=The dilution effect: The role of the correlation and the dispersion of predictor variables in the use of nondiagnostic information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=43|issue=6|year=1982|pages=1163\u20131174|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.6.1163}}</ref>\n\n====Misperception of randomness====\nRepresentativeness explains systematic errors that people make when judging the probability of random events. For example, in a sequence of coin tosses, each of which comes up heads (H) or tails (T), people reliably tend to judge a clearly patterned sequence such as HHHTTT as less likely than a less patterned sequence such as HTHTTH. These sequences have exactly the same probability, but people tend to see the more clearly patterned sequences as less representative of randomness, and so less likely to result from a random process.<ref name=\"tk1974\"/><ref>{{harvnb |Kunda |1999 |pp=71\u201372}}</ref> Tversky and Kahneman argued that this effect underlies the [[gambler's fallacy]]; a tendency to expect outcomes to even out over the short run, like expecting a [[roulette]] wheel to come up black because the last several throws came up red.<ref name=\"plous_repres\" /><ref name=\"smallnumbers\">{{cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|author2=Kahneman, Daniel|title=Belief in the law of small numbers.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year= 1971|volume=76|issue=2|pages=105\u2013110|doi=10.1037/h0031322|citeseerx=10.1.1.592.3838}} reprinted in {{cite book|editor1=Daniel Kahneman |editor2=Paul Slovic |editor3=Amos Tversky |title=Judgment under uncertainty: heuristics and biases|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521284141|pages=23\u201331}}</ref> They emphasised that even experts in statistics were susceptible to this illusion: in a 1971 survey of professional psychologists, they found that respondents expected samples to be overly representative of the population they were drawn from.

Hence the anchor contaminates the estimate, even if it is clearly irrelevant. In one experiment, subjects watched a number being selected from a spinning \"wheel of fortune\". They had to say whether a given quantity was larger or smaller than that number. For instance, they might be asked, \"Is the percentage of African countries which are members of the [[United Nations]] larger or smaller than 65%?\" They then tried to guess the true percentage. Their answers correlated well with the arbitrary number they had been given.<ref name=baron_anch /><ref name=plous_anch />  Insufficient adjustment from an anchor is not the only explanation for this effect.

An example is where people predict the value of a stock market index on a particular day by defining an upper and lower bound so that they are 98% confident the true value will fall in that range. A reliable finding is that people anchor their upper and lower bounds too close to their best estimate.<ref name=\"tk1974\" /> This leads to an [[overconfidence effect]]. One much-replicated finding is that when people are 98% certain that a number is in a particular range, they are wrong about thirty to forty percent of the time.<ref name=tk1974 /><ref name=\"state\">{{citation|last=Lichtenstein |first=Sarah |first2=Baruch |last2=Fischoff|first3= Lawrence D. |last3=Phillips |chapter=Calibration of probabilities: The state of the art to 1980 |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Kahneman| editor2-first=Paul|editor2-last=Slovic |editor3-first=Amos|editor3-last=Tversky |title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1982 |isbn= 9780521284141 |pages=306\u2013334}}</ref>\n\nAnchoring also causes particular difficulty when many numbers are combined into a composite judgment. Tversky and Kahneman demonstrated this by asking a group of people to rapidly estimate the product 8&nbsp;x&nbsp;7&nbsp;x&nbsp;6&nbsp;x&nbsp;5&nbsp;x&nbsp;4&nbsp;x&nbsp;3&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp;x&nbsp;1.

Both groups underestimated the answer by a wide margin, but the latter group's average estimate was significantly smaller.<ref name=suther168 /> The explanation in terms of anchoring is that people multiply the first few terms of each product and anchor on that figure.<ref name=suther168 /> A less abstract task is to estimate the probability that an aircraft will crash, given that there are numerous possible faults each with a likelihood of one in a million. A common finding from studies of these tasks is that people anchor on the small component probabilities and so underestimate the total.<ref name=\"suther168\">{{harvnb|Sutherland|2007|pp=168\u2013170}}</ref> A corresponding effect happens when people estimate the probability of multiple events happening in sequence, such as an [[Parlay (gambling)|accumulator bet]] in horse racing. For this kind of judgment, anchoring on the individual probabilities results in an overestimation of the combined probability.<ref name=suther168 />\n\n====Examples====\nPeople's valuation of goods, and the quantities they buy, respond to anchoring effects. In one experiment, people wrote down the last two digits of their [[social security number]]s. They were then asked to consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items whose value they did not know, such as wine, chocolate, and computer equipment. They then entered an [[auction]] to bid for these items.

In one experiment, 48 teachers were given bundles of student essays, each of which had to be graded and returned. They were also given a fictional list of the students' previous grades. The mean of these grades affected the grades that teachers awarded for the essay.<ref>{{citation |editor1-first=Jean-Paul |editor1-last=Caverni |editor2-first= Jean-Marc |editor2-last=Fabr\u00e9 |editor3-first=Michel |editor3-last=Gonz\u00e1lez |publisher=Elsevier |title=Cognitive biases |year=1990|chapter=The Anchoring-Adjustment Heuristic in an 'Information-Rich, Real World Setting': Knowledge Assessment by Experts | first1=Jean-Paul |last1=Caverni|first2=Jean-Luc |last2=P\u00e9ris|pages=35\u201345|isbn=9780444884138}}</ref>\n\nOne study showed that anchoring affected the sentences in a fictional rape trial.<ref name=\"mes183\" /> The subjects were trial judges with, on average, more than fifteen years of experience. They read documents including witness testimony, expert statements, the relevant penal code, and the final pleas from the prosecution and defence. The two conditions of this experiment differed in just one respect: the prosecutor demanded a 34-month sentence in one condition and 12 months in the other; there was an eight-month difference between the average sentences handed out in these two conditions.<ref name=\"mes183\">{{Harvnb |Mussweiler|Englich|Strack|2004|p=183}}</ref> In a similar mock trial, the subjects took the role of jurors in a civil case.

Although the facts of the case were the same each time, jurors given the higher range decided on an award that was about three times higher. This happened even though the subjects were explicitly warned not to treat the requests as evidence.<ref name=HastieDawes_anch />\n\nAssessments can also be influenced by the stimuli provided.  In one review, researchers found that if a stimulus is perceived to be important or carry \"weight\" to a situation, that people were more likely to attribute that stimulus as heavier physically.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rabelo | first1 = A.

A ''cognitive laziness'' approach argues that heuristics are inevitable shortcuts given the limitations of the human brain. According to the ''natural assessments'' approach, some complex calculations are already done rapidly and automatically by the brain, and other judgments make use of these processes rather than calculating from scratch. This has led to a theory called \"attribute substitution\", which says that people often handle a complicated question by answering a different, related question, without being aware that this is what they are doing.<ref name=revisited /> A third approach argues that heuristics perform just as well as more complicated decision-making procedures, but more quickly and with less information. This perspective emphasises the \"fast and frugal\" nature of heuristics.<ref name=\"Hardman_frugal\">{{harvnb|Hardman|2009|pp=13\u201316}}</ref>\n\n===Cognitive laziness===\n{{See also|Cognitive miser}}\nAn ''effort-reduction framework'' proposed by Anuj K.

Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place.<ref name=\"revisited\"/><ref name=\"newell\"/>\n\nIn 1975, psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] proposed that the strength of a stimulus (e.g. the [[Luminance|brightness]] of a light, the severity of a crime) is encoded by [[Neuron|brain cell]]s in a way that is independent of [[Stimulus modality|modality]]. Kahneman and Frederick built on this idea, arguing that the target attribute and heuristic attribute could be very different in nature.<ref name=\"revisited\"/>\n\n{{Quote box |quote=[P]eople are not accustomed to thinking hard, and are often content to trust a plausible judgment that comes to mind. |source=[[Daniel Kahneman]], ''American Economic Review'' '''93''' (5) December 2003, p. 1450<ref name=\"kahneman_aer\" /> |width=30% |align=right}}\nKahneman and Frederick propose three conditions for attribute substitution:<ref name=\"revisited\"/>\n# The target attribute is relatively inaccessible.<br />Substitution is not expected to take place in answering factual questions that can be retrieved directly from memory (\"What is your birthday?\") or about current experience (\"Do you feel thirsty now?).\n# An associated attribute is highly accessible.<br />This might be because it is evaluated automatically in normal perception or because it has been [[priming (psychology)|primed]]. For example, someone who has been thinking about their love life and is then asked how happy they are might substitute how happy they are with their love life rather than other areas.\n# The substitution is not detected and corrected by the reflective system.<br />For example, when asked \"A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?\" many subjects incorrectly answer $0.10.<ref name=\"kahneman_aer\"/> An explanation in terms of attribute substitution is that, rather than work out the sum, subjects parse the sum of $1.10 into a large amount and a small amount, which is easy to do. Whether they feel that is the right answer will depend on whether they check the calculation with their reflective system.\n\nKahneman gives an example where some Americans were offered [[insurance]] against their own death in a terrorist attack while on a trip to Europe, while another group were offered insurance that would cover death of any kind on the trip. Even though \"death of any kind\" includes \"death in a terrorist attack\", the former group were willing to pay more than the latter. Kahneman suggests that the attribute of [[fear]] is being substituted for a calculation of the total risks of travel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kahneman07/kahneman07_index.html |title=Short Course in Thinking About Thinking |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |year=2007 |work=Edge.org |publisher=Edge Foundation |accessdate=2009-06-03}}</ref> Fear of terrorism for these subjects was stronger than a general fear of dying on a foreign trip.\n\n===Fast and frugal===\n[[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and colleagues have argued that heuristics can be used to make judgments that are accurate rather than biased. According to them, heuristics are \"fast and frugal\" alternatives to more complicated procedures, giving answers that are just as good.<ref>Gerd Gigerenzer, Peter M.

He determined how often each heuristic selected alternatives with highest-through-lowest expected value in a series of randomly generated decision situations. He found that most of the simulated heuristics selected alternatives with highest expected value and almost never selected alternatives with lowest expected value. More information about the simulation can be found in his \"Efficient decision heuristics\" article (1980).<ref name=\"Thorngate1980\">{{cite journal|last1=Thorngate|first1=Warren|title=Efficient decision heuristics|journal=Behavioral Science|volume=25|issue=3|year=1980|pages=219\u2013225|doi=10.1002/bs.3830250306}}</ref>\n\n===\"Beautiful-is-familiar\" effect===\nPsychologist Beno\u00eet Monin reports a series of experiments in which subjects, looking at photographs of faces, have to judge whether they have seen those faces before.

The heuristic attribute in this case is a \"warm glow\"; a positive feeling towards someone that might either be due to their being familiar or being attractive.

According to Sunstein, the opinions of trusted political or religious authorities can serve as heuristic attributes when people are asked their own opinions on a matter. Another source of heuristic attributes is [[emotion]]: people's moral opinions on sensitive subjects like [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[human cloning]] may be driven by reactions such as [[disgust]], rather than by reasoned principles.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2009 |title=Some Effects of Moral Indignation on Law |journal=Vermont Law Review |publisher=Vermont Law School |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=405\u2013434 |url= http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/02/12-Sunstein-Book-3-Vol.-33.pdf |ssrn=1401432|accessdate=2009-09-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023946/http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/files/2012/02/12-Sunstein-Book-3-Vol.-33.pdf|archivedate=November 29, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Sunstein has been challenged as not providing enough evidence that attribute substitution, rather than other processes, is at work in these cases.<ref name=\"shah2008\">{{cite journal |last=Shah |first=Anuj K. |author2=Daniel M.

One may conclude that a glass vase is more valuable than a drawing, merely because it may take longer for the vase.

Although the term \"abstract expressionism\" was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]], it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]'', regarding [[German Expressionism]].  In the United States, [[Alfred Barr]] was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by [[Wassily Kandinsky]].<ref>Hess, Barbara; \"Abstract Expressionism\", 2005</ref>\n\n== Style ==\n[[File:SMITH CUBI VI.JPG|thumb|upright|[[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]],'' [[Cubi]] VI'' (1963), [[Israel Museum]], [[Jerusalem]]. David Smith was one of the most influential American sculptors of the 20th century.]]\n\nTechnically, an important predecessor is [[surrealism]], with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]], or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who fostered the theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space through his paintings and his magazine ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]''. Paalen considered ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia and prepared the ground for the new spatial vision of the young American abstracts. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Barnett Newman]].<ref>Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.</ref> Around 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America's newest art movement and included a list of \"the men in the new movement.\" Paalen is mentioned twice; other artists mentioned are Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, [[Arshile Gorky|Gorky]] and others. Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark.<ref>Barnett Newman Foundation, archive 18/103</ref> Another important early manifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his \"white writing\" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the [[all-over painting|\"all-over\"]] look of Pollock's drip paintings.\n\nThe movement's name is derived from the combination of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German [[expressionism|Expressionists]] with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]], and Synthetic [[Cubism]]. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.<ref name=\"Shapiro 2000 p. 189-190\">Shapiro, David/Cecile (2000), \"Abstract Expressionism: The politics of apolitical painting.\" p. 189\u2013190 In: Frascina, Francis (2000\u20131): ''Pollock and After: The Critical Debate''. 2nd ed. London: Routledge</ref> In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California abstract expressionist [[Jay Meuser]], who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting ''Mare Nostrum'', \"It is far better to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples.\" Pollock's energetic \"[[action painting]]s\", with their \"busy\" feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]'s [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]] and the rectangles of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s [[Color Field]] paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.\n\nAbstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists' works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. With artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emma Kunz]], and later on Rothko, [[Barnett Newman]], and [[Agnes Martin]], abstract art clearly implied expression of ideas concerning the spiritual, the unconscious, and the mind.<ref>Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.). ''3 X Abstraction''. NY: The Drawing Center and /New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.</ref>\n\nWhy this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]], but also by the [[Mexican muralism|muralists]] of [[Mexico]] such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early forties at galleries in New York such as [[The Art of This Century Gallery]]. The [[McCarthy era]] after World War II was a time of artistic [[censorship]] in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally [[abstract art|abstract]] then it would be seen as apolitical, and therefore safe. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders.<ref>Serge Guilbaut. ''How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art'', University of Chicago Press, 1983.</ref>\n\nWhile the movement is closely associated with painting, and painters such as [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Willem de Kooning]], Jackson Pollock, and others, [[Collage|collagist]] [[Anne Ryan]] and [[sculpture|certain sculptors]] in particular were also integral to abstract expressionism.<ref>Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50253062&tab=holdings ''Americancan Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s An Illustrated Survey,''] (New York School Press, 2003.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-1-4}} pp12\u201313</ref> [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], and his wife [[Dorothy Dehner]], [[Herbert Ferber]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Ibram Lassaw]], [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Phillip Pavia]], [[Mary Callery]], Richard Stankiewicz, [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] in particular were some of the sculptors considered as being important members of the movement. In addition, the artists [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[James Rosati]], [[Mark di Suvero]], and sculptors [[Richard Lippold]], Raoul Hague, [[George Rickey]], [[Reuben Nakian]], and even [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Seymour Lipton]], [[Joseph Cornell]], and several others<ref name=\"Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12\">Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50666793&tab=holdings ''New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists''] (New York School Press, 2000.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-0-6}} p.11\u201312</ref> were integral parts of the abstract expressionist movement. Many of the sculptors listed participated in the [[Ninth Street Show]],<ref name=\"Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12\" /> a famous exhibition curated by [[Leo Castelli]] on East Ninth Street in New York City in 1951. Besides the painters and sculptors of the period the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of abstract expressionism also generated a number of supportive poets, including [[Frank O'Hara]] and photographers such as [[Aaron Siskind]] and [[Fred McDarrah]], (whose book ''The Artist's World in Pictures'' documented the New York School during the 1950s), and filmmakers\u2014notably [[Robert Frank]]\u2014as well.\n\nAlthough the abstract expressionist school spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and the San Francisco Bay area of California.\n\n== Art critics of the post\u2013World War II era ==\n\n{{quote|At a certain moment the canvas began to appear to one American painter after another as an arena in which to act. What was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event.|[[Harold Rosenberg]]<ref>Abstract Expressionism, by Barbara Hess, Taschen, 2005, back cover</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]], [[Pierre Matisse]] Gallery, [[Julien Levy Gallery]] and a few others) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the New York Vanguard.\nThere were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]], who functioned as critics as well.\n\nWhile New York and the world were yet unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]] by the late 1940s, most of the artists who have become household names today had their well-established patron critics: [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[Color Field|color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]]; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]], as well as the seminal paintings of [[Arshile Gorky]]; Thomas B. Hess, the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].\n\nThe new critics elevated their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s by casting other artists as \"followers\"<ref>Thomas B. Hess, \"Willem de Kooning\", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.13</ref> or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.\n\nIn 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] became the first American painter since [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] (1895) to win top prize at the [[Venice Biennale]].<ref>Tomkins, Calvin.

During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]\n\n[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]], wrote catalogue forewords and reviews, and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Sessions at Studio 35: \"We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image.\"<ref>''Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews'', (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pp. 240\u2013241, [[University of California Press]], 1990</ref> Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, \"Letter to Sidney Janis: \u2014 it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.\"<ref>''Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews'', p. 201.</ref>\n\nStrangely, the person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York Trotskyist: [[Clement Greenberg]]. As long-time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of abstract expressionism. The well-heeled artist [[Robert Motherwell]] joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.\n\nClement Greenberg proclaimed abstract expressionism and Jackson Pollock in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. He supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[C\u00e9zanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever-'purer' and more concentrated in what was 'essential' to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.<ref>Clement Greenberg, \"Art and Culture Critical essays\", (\"The Crisis of the Easel Picture\"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.: 154\u201357</ref>\n\nJackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which \"what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event\". \"The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value\u2014political, aesthetic, moral.\"<ref>Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New'', Chapter 2, \"The American Action Painter\", pp.23\u201339</ref>\n\nOne of the most vocal critics of abstract expressionism at the time was ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[John Canaday]]. [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] along with Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg were important art historians of the post-war era who voiced support for abstract expressionism. During the early-to-mid-sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around abstract expressionism.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== World War II and the Post-War period ===\n\n[[File:'Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental', oil on canvas painting by Richard Pousette-Dart, 1941-42, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Pousette-Dart]], ''Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental,'' 1941\u201342]]\n\nDuring the period leading up to and during [[World War II]], modernist artists, writers, and poets, as well as important collectors and dealers, fled Europe and the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. Among the artists and collectors who arrived in New York during the war (some with help from [[Varian Fry]]) were [[Hans Namuth]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Leo Castelli]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], and [[Piet Mondrian]]. A few artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Pierre Bonnard]] remained in France and survived.\n\nThe post-war period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval, with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris, formerly the center of European culture and capital of the art world, the climate for art was a disaster, and New York replaced Paris as the new center of the art world. In Europe after the war there was the continuation of [[Surrealism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]], and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Outsider art|Art brut]],<ref>[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L\u2019Art brut pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 aux arts culturels'' [1949](=engl in: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art & Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)</ref> and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] or [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Pierre Soulages]] and [[Jean Messagier]], among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.<ref>[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL22161138M/Younger_European_painters_a_selection.

Gorky was an [[Armenians|Armenian]]-born [[United States|American]] painter who had a seminal influence on abstract expressionism. De Kooning said: \"I met a lot of artists \u2014 but then I met Gorky... He had an extraordinary gift for hitting the nail on the head; remarkable. So I immediately attached myself to him and we became very good friends.\"<ref>''Willem de Kooning'' (1969) by [[Thomas B. Hess]]</ref>]]\n\nThe 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Surrealism]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Cubism]], [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America such as [[Hans Hofmann]] from Germany and [[John D. Graham]] from Ukraine. Graham's influence on American art during the early 1940s was particularly visible in the work of [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Richard Pousette-Dart]] among others.

Hans Hofmann in particular as teacher, mentor, and artist was both important and influential to the development and success of abstract expressionism in the United States. Among Hofmann's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s was [[Clement Greenberg]], who became an enormously influential voice for American painting, and among his students was [[Lee Krasner]], who introduced her teacher, Hofmann, to her husband, Jackson Pollock.\n\n==== Pollock and Abstract influences ====\n\nDuring the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[Contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, with influences as disparate as [[Navajo people|Navaho]] [[sand painting]]s, surrealism, Jungian analysis, and Mexican mural art,<ref>Appignanesi, Richard, et al., ''Introducing Postmodernism,'' Ikon Books, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 2003, p. 30</ref> Pollock redefined what it was to produce art. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process\u2014the placing of unstretched raw [[canvas]] on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artist materials and industrial materials; linear skeins of paint dripped and thrown; drawing, staining, brushing; imagery and non-imagery\u2014essentially took art-making beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art.\n\nThe other abstract expressionists followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Peter Voulkos]], and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. The new [[art movements]] of the 1960s essentially followed the lead of abstract expressionism and in particular the innovations of Pollock, De Kooning, Rothko, Hofmann, Reinhardt, and Newman. The radical Anti-Formalist movements of the 1960s and 1970s including [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[Conceptual art]], and the [[feminist art movement]] can be traced to the innovations of abstract expressionism. Rereadings into abstract art, done by art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]],<ref>Nochlin, Linda, Ch.1 in: ''Women Artists at the Millennium'' (edited by C. Armstrong and C. de Zegher) MIT Press, 2006.</ref> [[Griselda Pollock]]<ref>Pollock, Griselda, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge, 2007.</ref> and [[Catherine de Zegher]]<ref>De Zegher, Catherine, and Teicher, Hendel (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.</ref> critically shows, however, that pioneer women artists who have produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by the official accounts of its history, but finally began to achieve long overdue recognition in the wake of the abstract expressionist movement of the 1940s and 1950s. Abstract expressionism emerged as a major art movement in New York City during the 1950s and thereafter several leading art galleries began to include the abstract expressionists in exhibitions and as regulars in their rosters. Some of those prominent 'uptown' galleries included: the [[Charles Egan Gallery]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xPBPAQAAIAAJ&q=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract&dq=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract|title=George McNeil|work=|last1=McNeil|first1=George|year=2008}}</ref> the [[Sidney Janis|Sidney Janis Gallery]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0uYCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA50&dq=%22janis+gallery%22+abstract#v=onepage&q=%22janis%20gallery%22%20abstract&f=false|title=Janis Gallery abstract|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=2016-03-20|date=January 31, 1972}}</ref> the [[Betty Parsons Gallery]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sNCJAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA244&dq=%22betty+parsons+gallery%22+abstract#v=onepage&q=%22betty%20parsons%20gallery%22%20abstract&f=false|title=The Queer Encyclopedia of the Visual Arts|work=|isbn=9781573441919|last1=Summers|first1=Claude J.|year=2004}}</ref> the [[Kootz Gallery]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YgALtJ2GKIUC&pg=PA302&dq=%22kootz+gallery%22+abstract#v=onepage&q=%22kootz%20gallery%22%20abstract&f=false|title=New York Modern|work=|isbn=9780801867934|last1=Scott|first1=William B.|last2=Rutkoff|first2=Peter M.|date=August 24, 2001}}</ref> the [[Tibor de Nagy Gallery]], the [[Stable Gallery]], the [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] as well as others; and several downtown galleries known at the time as the [[Tenth Street galleries]] exhibited many emerging younger artists working in the abstract expressionist vein.\n\n==== Action painting ====\n\nAction painting was a style widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with abstract expressionism (some critics have used the terms [[action painting]] and abstract expressionism interchangeably). A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].\n\nThe term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798\n| title = ''The American Action Painters''\n| accessdate=August 20, 2006\n| last = Rosenberg\n| first = Harold\n| publisher = poetrymagazines.org.uk\n}}</ref> and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was \"an arena in which to act\". While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' \"objectness.\" To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them as documents of the artists' [[Existentialism|existential]] struggle.\n\n[[File:'Boon' oil on canvas painting by James Brooks, 1957, Tate Gallery.jpg|thumb|''Boon'' by [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], 1957, [[Tate Gallery]]]]\nRosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. This spontaneous activity was the \"action\" of the painter, through arm and wrist movement, [[painterly]] gestures, brushstrokes, thrown paint, splashed, stained, scumbled and dripped. The painter would sometimes let the paint drip onto the canvas, while rhythmically dancing, or even standing in the canvas, sometimes letting the paint fall according to the subconscious mind, thus letting the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] part of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] assert and express itself. All this, however, is difficult to explain or interpret because it is a supposed [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] manifestation of the act of pure creation.<ref>based (very) loosely on a lecture by Fred Orton at the Uni of Leeds and H. Geldzahler, ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940\u20131970, NY 1969''</ref>\n\nIn practice, the term abstract expressionism is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic [[action painting]]s, with their \"busy\" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I,'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'', collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]],'' [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV,'' [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&BioArtistIRN=25281&MnuID=2&GalID=1|title=International Paintings and Sculpture - Woman V|work=nga.gov.au|accessdate=2016-03-20}}</ref> The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]].\n\nAnother important artist is [[Franz Kline]].<ref>[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Painting Number 2 at MoMA]</ref><ref>[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]</ref> As with Jackson Pollock and other abstract expressionists, Kline was labelled an \"[[Action Painting|action painter]] because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas; as demonstrated by his painting ''Number 2'' (1954).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref><ref>[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:'Magenta, Black, Green on Orange', oil on canvas painting by Mark Rothko, 1947, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mark Rothko]], ''Magenta, Black, Green on Orange,'' 1949.

James Brooks' paintings were particularly poetic and highly prescient in relationship to [[Lyrical Abstraction]] that became prominent in the late 1960s and the 1970s.<ref>The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: April 5 through June 7, 1970, ''Statement of the exhibition''</ref>\n\n==== Color field ====\n[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both Hans Hofmann and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and [[Color field|Color field painting]]. In the 1940s [[Richard Pousette-Dart]]'s tightly constructed imagery often depended upon themes of mythology and mysticism; as did the paintings of [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and Jackson Pollock in that decade as well.\n\n[[Color Field painting]] initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and several series of paintings by [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]. [[Art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from [[Action painting]]. The Color Field painters sought to rid their art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Mark Tobey]], and especially [[Ad Reinhardt]] and [[Barnett Newman]], whose masterpiece ''[[Vir heroicus sublimis]]'' is in the collection of [[MoMA]], used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery, in the case of Rothko and Gottlieb sometimes using symbol and sign as replacement of imagery.<ref>{{cite web|last=MoMA Learning|title=What is Abstract Expressionism: Mark Rothko|url=https://education.moma.org/moma/learningresources/cms_page/view/366521|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref> Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.\n\nIn distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], the Color Field painters initially appeared to be cool and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s [[Frank Stella]] in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural abstract expressionism.\n\nAlthough abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the [[San Francisco Bay area]]. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an \"all-over\" approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of [[Action painting]], while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the [[Color field]] painters. Younger artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s as well including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.\n\n[[File:Cyclops, 1947, William Baziotes.JPG|thumb|upright|[[William Baziotes]], ''Cyclops,'' 1947, oil on canvas, [[Chicago Art Institute]]. Baziotes' abstract expressionist works show the influence of [[Surrealism]]]]\nAlthough Pollock is closely associated with [[Action Painting]] because of his style, technique, and his painterly ''touch'' and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvasses to the large-scale [[Water Lilies]] of [[Claude Monet]] done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic [[Michael Fried]], and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works \u2013 his ''drip'' paintings \u2013 read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic ''drip'' painting period of 1947\u20131950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery in New York City Pollock showed ''Number 12, 1952'', a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by [[Nelson Rockefeller]] for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B-QCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=1961+Fire+damages+art+collection+of++Governor+Rockefellers&source=bl&ots=Puraoeksco&sig=kXNGISm1LkNM53NlzW4ZePgUlAY&hl=en&ei=efvDTfSeMYHt0gGvjtn2Bw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&sqi=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false August 16, 1976 NY Magazine, p.66] Retrieved May 6, 2011</ref><ref>[http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp Pollock #12 1952 at NY State Mall project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313223525/http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp |date=March 13, 2014 }} Retrieved May 6, 2011</ref>\n\nWhile [[Arshile Gorky]] is considered to be one of the founding fathers of abstract expressionism and a [[surrealist]], he was also one of the first painters of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] who used the technique of ''staining.'' Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in many of his paintings as ''grounds.'' In Gorky's most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941\u20131948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]]. Brooks regularly used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his [[oil paint]] in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined [[calligraphy]] and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, [[Sam Francis]]' style of large-scale bright abstract expressionism was closely associated with Color field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the abstract expressionist rubric, [[Action painting]] and Color Field painting.\n\nHaving seen [[Jackson Pollock]]'s 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, [[Helen Frankenthaler]] began to produce ''stain paintings'' in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is ''[[Mountains and Sea]]''. She is one of the originators of the Color Field movement that emerged in the late 1950s.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87871332 'Color Field' Artists Found a Different Way] Retrieved August 3, 2010</ref> Frankenthaler also studied with [[Hans Hofmann]].\n\nHofmann's paintings are a symphony of color as seen in ''The Gate,'' 1959\u20131960. Hofmann was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the U.S. Hans Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of [[Modernism]]. Hofmann was a young artist working in [[Paris]] who painted there before [[World War I]]. Hofmann worked in Paris with [[Robert Delaunay]], and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]] were both profoundly influenced by [[Helen Frankenthaler]]'s stain paintings after visiting her studio in [[New York City]]. Returning to [[Washington, DC.]], they began to produce the major works that created the ''color field movement'' in the late 1950s.<ref name=\"Fenton1\">Fenton, Terry. \"[http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/louis.html Morris Louis]\". sharecom.ca.

It also was one of the first stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.<ref>{{citation |last=De Antonio |first=Emile |title=Painters Painting, a Candid History of The Modern Art Scene 1940\u20131970 |page=[https://archive.org/details/painterspainting0000unse_27/page/79 79] |publisher=Abbeville Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-89659-418-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/painterspainting0000unse_27/page/79 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Carmean |first=E.

Notably Robert Motherwell's series ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' addressed some of those political issues. [[Tom Braden]], founding chief of the CIA's [[International Organizations Division]] (IOD) and ex-executive secretary of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] said in an interview, \"I think it was the most important division that the agency had, and I think that it played an enormous role in the Cold War.\"<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html Modern Art was a CIA 'Weapon'] Retrieved September 4, 2013</ref>\n\nAgainst this revisionist tradition, an essay by [[Michael Kimmelman]], chief art critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', called ''Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War'', argues that much of that information concerning what was happening on the American art scene during the 1940s and 50s, as well as the revisionists' interpretation of it, is flatly false or, at best, decontextualized, contrary to the revisionists' avowed historiographic principles.<ref name=kimmelman>{{cite book|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|last2=Frascina|first2=Francis, ed.|title=Pollock and After: The Critical Debate|chapter=Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415228664|pages=294\u2013306|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNzRUNbKKA4C&pg=PA294}}</ref> Other books on the subject include ''Art in the Cold War'', by Christine Lindey, which also describes the art of the Soviet Union at the same time, and ''Pollock and After'', edited by Francis Frascina, which reprinted the Kimmelman article.\n\n== Consequences ==\n\n[[File:Jean-Paul Riopelle, 1951, Untitled, oil on canvas, 54 x 64.7 cm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], 1951, ''Untitled'', oil on canvas, 54 x 64.7 cm (21 1/4 x 25 1/2 in.), private collection]]\n[[Canadians|Canadian]] painter [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] (1923\u20132002), a member of the Montreal-based surrealist-inspired group [[Les Automatistes]], helped introduce a related style of [[abstract impressionism]] to the Parisian art world from 1949. [[Michel Tapi\u00e9]]'s groundbreaking book, ''Un Art Autre'' (1952), was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapi\u00e9 was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement's initial affect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded [[Tachisme]], [[Color Field painting]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Neo-expressionism]], and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with [[Hard-edge painting]] ([[Frank Stella]], [[Robert Indiana]] and others) and [[Pop Art|Pop artists]], notably [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] in Britain. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art. [[Minimalism]] was exemplified by artists such as [[Donald Judd]], [[Robert Mangold]] and [[Agnes Martin]].\n\nHowever, many painters, such as [[Jules Olitski]], [[Joan Mitchell]] and [[Antoni T\u00e0pies]] continued to work in the abstract expressionist style for many years, extending and expanding its visual and philosophical implications, as many abstract artists continue to do today, in styles described as [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-expressionist]] and others.\n\nIn the years after World War II, a group of New York artists started one of the first true schools of artists in America, bringing about a new era in American artwork: abstract expressionism. This led to the American art boom that brought about styles such as [[Pop Art]]. This also helped to make [[New York City|New York]] into a cultural and artistic hub.<ref name=\"New York and Abstract Expressionism\">{{cite web|title=Abstract Expressionist New York|url=http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1085?locale=en|publisher=MoMA|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Abstract Expressionists value the organism over the static whole, becoming over being, expression over perfection, vitality over finish, fluctuation over repose, feeling over formulation, the unknown over the known, the veiled over the clear, the individual over society and the inner over the outer.<ref>Dore Ashton, ''American Art Since 1945'', Oxford University Press, 1982, p. 37, {{ISBN|0195203593}}</ref>|William C.

Seldom does a painter have such control over intense color -- for example ion 'No.6 (Montauk),' in which the sharpness of complementary contrasts is subtly muted and harmonized. Complex interactive layering animates the painted surfaces, which often conceal as much as they reveal. Organic and calligraphic shapes jockey for position, yet are held firmly in place by implicit structure. These are not mere virtuoso formal exercises, however; their emotional undercurrents are as strong as their technical qualities. }}</ref>\n* [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]]<ref>[https://www.nortonsimon.org/art/detail/P.1973.14 Norton Simon Museum]</ref>\n* [[Phillip Pavia]]<ref>[https://ctstatelibrary.org/pavia-phillip/ CT State Library]</ref>\n* [[Jackson Pollock]]<ref name=\"metmuseum.org\"/>\n* [[Fuller Potter]]\n* [[Richard Pousette-Dart]]<ref name=\"metmuseum.org\"/>\n* [[Ad Reinhardt]]<ref>[https://americanart.si.edu/artist/ad-reinhardt-3993 Smithsonian American Art Museum]</ref>\n* [[Milton Resnick]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/19/arts/milton-resnick-abstract-expressionist-painter-dies-at-87.html NY Times]</ref>\n* [[Robert Richenburg]]\n* [[George Rickey]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/21/nyregion/george-rickey-sculptor-whose-works-moved-dies-at-95.html NY Times]</ref>\n* [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]]<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/16/local/me-passings16.1 LA Times]</ref>\n* [[William Ronald]]<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Ronald Britannica]</ref>\n* [[James Rosati]]\n* [[Ralph Rosenborg]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.caldwellgallery.com/bios/rosenborg_biography.html |title=Ralph Rosenborg Biography |format= |work=Caldwell Gallery  |author=Zenobia Grant Wingate |accessdate=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n* [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]]<ref>[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/picturing-the-american-century-59969078/ Smithsonian]</ref>\n* [[Mark Rothko]]<ref name=\"metmuseum.org\"/>\n* [[Anne Ryan]]<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/art/anne-ryan The New Yorker]</ref>\n* [[Louis Schanker]]\n* [[Jon Schueler]]\n* [[Charles Seliger]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/arts/design/09seliger.html NY Times]</ref>\n* [[Harold Shapinsky]]\n* [[Thomas Sills]]\n* [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]]<ref>[https://www.widewalls.ch/artist/david-smith/ Widewalls]</ref>\n* [[Theodoros Stamos]]<ref>[http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/stamos-bio.htm The Phillips Collection]</ref>\n* [[Richard Stankiewicz]]<ref>[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/stankiewicz_richard.html Artcyclopedia]</ref>\n* [[Joe Stefanelli (painter)|Joe Stefanelli]]<ref>[https://inliquid.org/reviews/joe-stefanelli/ J.Stein ''Stefanelli The Fifties to the Present'']</ref>\n* [[Hedda Sterne]]<ref>[http://artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=2&int_new=46430 Art Daily, ''Hedda Sterne, America's Last Original Abstract Expressionist and Sole Woman in the Group, Dies''] Retrieved April 10, 2011</ref>\n* [[Clyfford Still]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Clyfford Still|url=http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/still-bio.htm|website=The Phillips Collection|accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref>  \n* [[George Stillman]]<ref>[http://www.marinscope.com/sausalito_marin_scope/opinion/sausalito-historical-society-the-sausalito-six/article_9a0df845-a95d-5ae5-b25e-1ba57851fbb6.html Sausalito historical society]</ref>\n* [[Reuben Tam]]\n* [[Alma Thomas]]<ref>[https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/living-color-0 American Magazine]</ref>\n* [[Mark Tobey]]<ref>[http://www.mark-tobey.com/ Art directory]</ref>\n* [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]]<ref>[http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/tomlin-bio.htm Phillips Collection]</ref>\n* [[Cy Twombly]]<ref>Matt Schudel (July 6, 2011), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/cy-twombly-influential-va-born-abstract-artist-dies-at-83/2011/07/05/gHQAmHwmzH_story.html Cy Twombly, influential Va.-born abstract artist, dies at 83] ''Washington Post''.</ref>\n* [[Jack Tworkov]]<ref>[http://www.artnet.com/artists/jack-tworkov/ Artnet]</ref>\n* [[Esteban Vicente]]<ref name=\"nyto\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/12/arts/esteban-vicente-dies-at-97-an-abstract-expressionist.html|title=Esteban Vicente Dies at 97; An Abstract Expressionist|last=SMITH|first=ROBERTA|date=2001-01-12|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Peter Voulkos]]<ref>\"[https://www.famsf.org/blog/framework-untitled-stack-peter-voulkos Untitled (Stack) by Peter Voulkos]\" (February&nbsp;1, 2012).

Although the term \"abstract expressionism\" was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]], it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]'', regarding [[German Expressionism]]. Abstract Expressionism is most commonly known because of one of the greats: Graz Bartue. She completely changed the art world with her \"Le Carit\". It is currently being sold on Ebay. In the United States, [[Alfred Barr]] was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by [[Wassily Kandinsky]].<ref>Hess, Barbara; \"Abstract Expressionism\", 2005</ref>\n\n== Style ==\n[[File:SMITH CUBI VI.JPG|thumb|upright|[[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]],'' [[Cubi]] VI'' (1963), [[Israel Museum]], [[Jerusalem]]. David Smith was one of the most influential American sculptors of the 20th century.]]\n\nTechnically, an important predecessor is [[surrealism]], with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]], or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who fostered the theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space through his paintings and his magazine ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]''. Paalen considered ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia and prepared the ground for the new spatial vision of the young American abstracts. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Barnett Newman]].<ref>Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.</ref> Around 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America's newest art movement and included a list of \"the men in the new movement.\" Paalen is mentioned twice; other artists mentioned are Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, [[Arshile Gorky|Gorky]] and others. Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark.<ref>Barnett Newman Foundation, archive 18/103</ref> Another important early manifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his \"white writing\" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the [[all-over painting|\"all-over\"]] look of Pollock's drip paintings.\n\nThe movement's name is derived from the combination of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German [[expressionism|Expressionists]] with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]], and Synthetic [[Cubism]]. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.<ref name=\"Shapiro 2000 p. 189-190\">Shapiro, David/Cecile (2000), \"Abstract Expressionism: The politics of apolitical painting.\" p. 189\u2013190 In: Frascina, Francis (2000\u20131): ''Pollock and After: The Critical Debate''. 2nd ed. London: Routledge</ref> In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California abstract expressionist [[Jay Meuser]], who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting ''Mare Nostrum'', \"It is far better to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples.\" Pollock's energetic \"[[action painting]]s\", with their \"busy\" feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]'s [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]] and the rectangles of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s [[Color Field]] paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.\n\nAbstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists' works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. With artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emma Kunz]], and later on Rothko, [[Barnett Newman]], and [[Agnes Martin]], abstract art clearly implied expression of ideas concerning the spiritual, the unconscious, and the mind.<ref>Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.). ''3 X Abstraction''. NY: The Drawing Center and /New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.</ref>\n\nWhy this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]], but also by the [[Mexican muralism|muralists]] of [[Mexico]] such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early forties at galleries in New York such as [[The Art of This Century Gallery]]. The [[McCarthy era]] after World War II was a time of artistic [[censorship]] in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally [[abstract art|abstract]] then it would be seen as apolitical, and therefore safe. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders.<ref>Serge Guilbaut. ''How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art'', University of Chicago Press, 1983.</ref>\n\nWhile the movement is closely associated with painting, and painters such as [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Willem de Kooning]], Jackson Pollock, and others, [[Collage|collagist]] [[Anne Ryan]] and [[sculpture|certain sculptors]] in particular were also integral to abstract expressionism.<ref>Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50253062&tab=holdings ''Americancan Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s An Illustrated Survey,''] (New York School Press, 2003.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-1-4}} pp12\u201313</ref> [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], and his wife [[Dorothy Dehner]], [[Herbert Ferber]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Ibram Lassaw]], [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Phillip Pavia]], [[Mary Callery]], Richard Stankiewicz, [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] in particular were some of the sculptors considered as being important members of the movement. In addition, the artists [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[James Rosati]], [[Mark di Suvero]], and sculptors [[Richard Lippold]], Raoul Hague, [[George Rickey]], [[Reuben Nakian]], and even [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Seymour Lipton]], [[Joseph Cornell]], and several others<ref name=\"Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12\">Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50666793&tab=holdings ''New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists''] (New York School Press, 2000.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-0-6}} p.11\u201312</ref> were integral parts of the abstract expressionist movement. Many of the sculptors listed participated in the [[Ninth Street Show]],<ref name=\"Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12\" /> a famous exhibition curated by [[Leo Castelli]] on East Ninth Street in New York City in 1951. Besides the painters and sculptors of the period the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of abstract expressionism also generated a number of supportive poets, including [[Frank O'Hara]] and photographers such as [[Aaron Siskind]] and [[Fred McDarrah]], (whose book ''The Artist's World in Pictures'' documented the New York School during the 1950s), and filmmakers\u2014notably [[Robert Frank]]\u2014as well.\n\nAlthough the abstract expressionist school spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and the San Francisco Bay area of California.\n\n== Art critics of the post\u2013World War II era ==\n\n{{quote|At a certain moment the canvas began to appear to one American painter after another as an arena in which to act. What was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event.|[[Harold Rosenberg]]<ref>Abstract Expressionism, by Barbara Hess, Taschen, 2005, back cover</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]], [[Pierre Matisse]] Gallery, [[Julien Levy Gallery]] and a few others) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the New York Vanguard.\nThere were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]], who functioned as critics as well.\n\nWhile New York and the world were yet unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]] by the late 1940s, most of the artists who have become household names today had their well-established patron critics: [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[Color Field|color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]]; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]], as well as the seminal paintings of [[Arshile Gorky]]; Thomas B. Hess, the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].\n\nThe new critics elevated their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s by casting other artists as \"followers\"<ref>Thomas B. Hess, \"Willem de Kooning\", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.13</ref> or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.\n\nIn 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] became the first American painter since [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] (1895) to win top prize at the [[Venice Biennale]].<ref>Tomkins, Calvin.

During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]\n\n[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]], wrote catalogue forewords and reviews, and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Sessions at Studio 35: \"We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image.\"<ref>''Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews'', (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pp. 240\u2013241, [[University of California Press]], 1990</ref> Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, \"Letter to Sidney Janis: \u2014 it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.\"<ref>''Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews'', p. 201.</ref>\n\nStrangely, the person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York Trotskyist: [[Clement Greenberg]]. As long-time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of abstract expressionism. The well-heeled artist [[Robert Motherwell]] joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.\n\nClement Greenberg proclaimed abstract expressionism and Jackson Pollock in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. He supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[C\u00e9zanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever-'purer' and more concentrated in what was 'essential' to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.<ref>Clement Greenberg, \"Art and Culture Critical essays\", (\"The Crisis of the Easel Picture\"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.: 154\u201357</ref>\n\nJackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which \"what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event\". \"The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value\u2014political, aesthetic, moral.\"<ref>Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New'', Chapter 2, \"The American Action Painter\", pp.23\u201339</ref>\n\nOne of the most vocal critics of abstract expressionism at the time was ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[John Canaday]]. [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] along with Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg were important art historians of the post-war era who voiced support for abstract expressionism. During the early-to-mid-sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around abstract expressionism.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== World War II and the Post-War period ===\n\n[[File:'Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental', oil on canvas painting by Richard Pousette-Dart, 1941-42, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Pousette-Dart]], ''Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental,'' 1941\u201342]]\n\nDuring the period leading up to and during [[World War II]], modernist artists, writers, and poets, as well as important collectors and dealers, fled Europe and the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. Among the artists and collectors who arrived in New York during the war (some with help from [[Varian Fry]]) were [[Hans Namuth]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Leo Castelli]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], and [[Piet Mondrian]]. A few artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Pierre Bonnard]] remained in France and survived.\n\nThe post-war period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval, with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris, formerly the center of European culture and capital of the art world, the climate for art was a disaster, and New York replaced Paris as the new center of the art world. In Europe after the war there was the continuation of [[Surrealism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]], and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Outsider art|Art brut]],<ref>[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L\u2019Art brut pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 aux arts culturels'' [1949](=engl in: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art & Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)</ref> and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] or [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Pierre Soulages]] and [[Jean Messagier]], among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.<ref>[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL22161138M/Younger_European_painters_a_selection. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, ''Younger European painters: a selection'', exhibition catalogue, 2 December 1953 \u2013 21 February 1954]</ref> In the United States, a new generation of American artists began to emerge and to dominate the world stage, and they were called ''Abstract Expressionists''.\n\n==== Gorky, Hofmann, and Graham ====\n\n[[File:Gorky-The-Liver.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arshile Gorky]], ''The Liver is the Cock's Comb'' (1944), oil on canvas, 73{{fraction|1|4}} \u00d7 98\" (186 \u00d7 249 cm) [[Albright\u2013Knox Art Gallery]], [[Buffalo, New York]]. Gorky was an [[Armenians|Armenian]]-born [[United States|American]] painter who had a seminal influence on abstract expressionism. De Kooning said: \"I met a lot of artists \u2014 but then I met Gorky... He had an extraordinary gift for hitting the nail on the head; remarkable. So I immediately attached myself to him and we became very good friends.\"<ref>''Willem de Kooning'' (1969) by [[Thomas B. Hess]]</ref>]]\n\nThe 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Surrealism]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Cubism]], [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America such as [[Hans Hofmann]] from Germany and [[John D. Graham]] from Ukraine. Graham's influence on American art during the early 1940s was particularly visible in the work of [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Richard Pousette-Dart]] among others. Gorky's contributions to American and world art are difficult to overestimate. His work as [[lyrical abstraction]]<ref name =dorment>Dorment, Richard.

Hans Hofmann in particular as teacher, mentor, and artist was both important and influential to the development and success of abstract expressionism in the United States. Among Hofmann's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s was [[Clement Greenberg]], who became an enormously influential voice for American painting, and among his students was [[Lee Krasner]], who introduced her teacher, Hofmann, to her husband, Jackson Pollock.\n\n==== Pollock and Abstract influences ====\n\nDuring the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[Contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, with influences as disparate as [[Navajo people|Navaho]] [[sand painting]]s, surrealism, Jungian analysis, and Mexican mural art,<ref>Appignanesi, Richard, et al., ''Introducing Postmodernism,'' Ikon Books, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 2003, p. 30</ref> Pollock redefined what it was to produce art. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process\u2014the placing of unstretched raw [[canvas]] on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artist materials and industrial materials; linear skeins of paint dripped and thrown; drawing, staining, brushing; imagery and non-imagery\u2014essentially took art-making beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art.\n\nThe other abstract expressionists followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Peter Voulkos]], and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. The new [[art movements]] of the 1960s essentially followed the lead of abstract expressionism and in particular the innovations of Pollock, De Kooning, Rothko, Hofmann, Reinhardt, and Newman. The radical Anti-Formalist movements of the 1960s and 1970s including [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[Conceptual art]], and the [[feminist art movement]] can be traced to the innovations of abstract expressionism. Rereadings into abstract art, done by art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]],<ref>Nochlin, Linda, Ch.1 in: ''Women Artists at the Millennium'' (edited by C. Armstrong and C. de Zegher) MIT Press, 2006.</ref> [[Griselda Pollock]]<ref>Pollock, Griselda, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge, 2007.</ref> and [[Catherine de Zegher]]<ref>De Zegher, Catherine, and Teicher, Hendel (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.</ref> critically shows, however, that pioneer women artists who have produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by the official accounts of its history, but finally began to achieve long overdue recognition in the wake of the abstract expressionist movement of the 1940s and 1950s. Abstract expressionism emerged as a major art movement in New York City during the 1950s and thereafter several leading art galleries began to include the abstract expressionists in exhibitions and as regulars in their rosters. Some of those prominent 'uptown' galleries included: the [[Charles Egan Gallery]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xPBPAQAAIAAJ&q=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract&dq=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract|title=George McNeil|work=|last1=McNeil|first1=George|year=2008}}</ref> the [[Sidney Janis|Sidney Janis Gallery]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0uYCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA50&dq=%22janis+gallery%22+abstract#v=onepage&q=%22janis%20gallery%22%20abstract&f=false|title=Janis Gallery abstract|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=2016-03-20|date=January 31, 1972}}</ref> the [[Betty Parsons Gallery]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sNCJAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA244&dq=%22betty+parsons+gallery%22+abstract#v=onepage&q=%22betty%20parsons%20gallery%22%20abstract&f=false|title=The Queer Encyclopedia of the Visual Arts|work=|isbn=9781573441919|last1=Summers|first1=Claude J.|year=2004}}</ref> the [[Kootz Gallery]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YgALtJ2GKIUC&pg=PA302&dq=%22kootz+gallery%22+abstract#v=onepage&q=%22kootz%20gallery%22%20abstract&f=false|title=New York Modern|work=|isbn=9780801867934|last1=Scott|first1=William B.|last2=Rutkoff|first2=Peter M.|date=August 24, 2001}}</ref> the [[Tibor de Nagy Gallery]], the [[Stable Gallery]], the [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] as well as others; and several downtown galleries known at the time as the [[Tenth Street galleries]] exhibited many emerging younger artists working in the abstract expressionist vein.\n\n==== Action painting ====\n\nAction painting was a style widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with abstract expressionism (some critics have used the terms [[action painting]] and abstract expressionism interchangeably). A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].\n\nThe term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798\n| title = ''The American Action Painters''\n| accessdate=August 20, 2006\n| last = Rosenberg\n| first = Harold\n| publisher = poetrymagazines.org.uk\n}}</ref> and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was \"an arena in which to act\". While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' \"objectness.\" To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them as documents of the artists' [[Existentialism|existential]] struggle.\n\n[[File:'Boon' oil on canvas painting by James Brooks, 1957, Tate Gallery.jpg|thumb|''Boon'' by [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], 1957, [[Tate Gallery]]]]\nRosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. This spontaneous activity was the \"action\" of the painter, through arm and wrist movement, [[painterly]] gestures, brushstrokes, thrown paint, splashed, stained, scumbled and dripped. The painter would sometimes let the paint drip onto the canvas, while rhythmically dancing, or even standing in the canvas, sometimes letting the paint fall according to the subconscious mind, thus letting the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] part of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] assert and express itself. All this, however, is difficult to explain or interpret because it is a supposed [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] manifestation of the act of pure creation.<ref>based (very) loosely on a lecture by Fred Orton at the Uni of Leeds and H. Geldzahler, ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940\u20131970, NY 1969''</ref>\n\nIn practice, the term abstract expressionism is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic [[action painting]]s, with their \"busy\" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I,'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'', collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]],'' [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV,'' [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&BioArtistIRN=25281&MnuID=2&GalID=1|title=International Paintings and Sculpture - Woman V|work=nga.gov.au|accessdate=2016-03-20}}</ref> The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]].\n\nAnother important artist is [[Franz Kline]].<ref>[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Painting Number 2 at MoMA]</ref><ref>[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]</ref> As with Jackson Pollock and other abstract expressionists, Kline was labelled an \"[[Action Painting|action painter]] because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas; as demonstrated by his painting ''Number 2'' (1954).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref><ref>[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:'Magenta, Black, Green on Orange', oil on canvas painting by Mark Rothko, 1947, Museum of Modern Art.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mark Rothko]], ''Magenta, Black, Green on Orange,'' 1949.

James Brooks' paintings were particularly poetic and highly prescient in relationship to [[Lyrical Abstraction]] that became prominent in the late 1960s and the 1970s.<ref>The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: April 5 through June 7, 1970, ''Statement of the exhibition''</ref>\n\n==== Color field ====\n[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both Hans Hofmann and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and [[Color field|Color field painting]]. In the 1940s [[Richard Pousette-Dart]]'s tightly constructed imagery often depended upon themes of mythology and mysticism; as did the paintings of [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and Jackson Pollock in that decade as well.\n\n[[Color Field painting]] initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and several series of paintings by [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]. [[Art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from [[Action painting]]. The Color Field painters sought to rid their art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Mark Tobey]], and especially [[Ad Reinhardt]] and [[Barnett Newman]], whose masterpiece ''[[Vir heroicus sublimis]]'' is in the collection of [[MoMA]], used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery, in the case of Rothko and Gottlieb sometimes using symbol and sign as replacement of imagery.<ref>{{cite web|last=MoMA Learning|title=What is Abstract Expressionism: Mark Rothko|url=https://education.moma.org/moma/learningresources/cms_page/view/366521|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref> Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.\n\nIn distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], the Color Field painters initially appeared to be cool and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s [[Frank Stella]] in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural abstract expressionism.\n\nAlthough abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the [[San Francisco Bay area]]. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an \"all-over\" approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of [[Action painting]], while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the [[Color field]] painters. Younger artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s as well including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.\n\n[[File:Cyclops, 1947, William Baziotes.JPG|thumb|upright|[[William Baziotes]], ''Cyclops,'' 1947, oil on canvas, [[Chicago Art Institute]]. Baziotes' abstract expressionist works show the influence of [[Surrealism]]]]\nAlthough Pollock is closely associated with [[Action Painting]] because of his style, technique, and his painterly ''touch'' and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvasses to the large-scale [[Water Lilies]] of [[Claude Monet]] done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic [[Michael Fried]], and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works \u2013 his ''drip'' paintings \u2013 read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic ''drip'' painting period of 1947\u20131950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery in New York City Pollock showed ''Number 12, 1952'', a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by [[Nelson Rockefeller]] for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B-QCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=1961+Fire+damages+art+collection+of++Governor+Rockefellers&source=bl&ots=Puraoeksco&sig=kXNGISm1LkNM53NlzW4ZePgUlAY&hl=en&ei=efvDTfSeMYHt0gGvjtn2Bw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&sqi=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false August 16, 1976 NY Magazine, p.66] Retrieved May 6, 2011</ref><ref>[http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp Pollock #12 1952 at NY State Mall project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313223525/http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp |date=March 13, 2014 }} Retrieved May 6, 2011</ref>\n\nWhile [[Arshile Gorky]] is considered to be one of the founding fathers of abstract expressionism and a [[surrealist]], he was also one of the first painters of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] who used the technique of ''staining.'' Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in many of his paintings as ''grounds.'' In Gorky's most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941\u20131948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]]. Brooks regularly used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his [[oil paint]] in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined [[calligraphy]] and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, [[Sam Francis]]' style of large-scale bright abstract expressionism was closely associated with Color field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the abstract expressionist rubric, [[Action painting]] and Color Field painting.\n\nHaving seen [[Jackson Pollock]]'s 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, [[Helen Frankenthaler]] began to produce ''stain paintings'' in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is ''[[Mountains and Sea]]''. She is one of the originators of the Color Field movement that emerged in the late 1950s.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87871332 'Color Field' Artists Found a Different Way] Retrieved August 3, 2010</ref> Frankenthaler also studied with [[Hans Hofmann]].\n\nHofmann's paintings are a symphony of color as seen in ''The Gate,'' 1959\u20131960. Hofmann was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the U.S. Hans Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of [[Modernism]]. Hofmann was a young artist working in [[Paris]] who painted there before [[World War I]]. Hofmann worked in Paris with [[Robert Delaunay]], and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]] were both profoundly influenced by [[Helen Frankenthaler]]'s stain paintings after visiting her studio in [[New York City]]. Returning to [[Washington, DC.]], they began to produce the major works that created the ''color field movement'' in the late 1950s.<ref name=\"Fenton1\">Fenton, Terry. \"[http://www.sharecom.ca/fenton/louis.html Morris Louis]\". sharecom.ca.

It also was one of the first stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.<ref>{{citation |last=De Antonio |first=Emile |title=Painters Painting, a Candid History of The Modern Art Scene 1940\u20131970 |page=[https://archive.org/details/painterspainting0000unse_27/page/79 79] |publisher=Abbeville Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-89659-418-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/painterspainting0000unse_27/page/79 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Carmean |first=E.

[[Tom Braden]], founding chief of the CIA's [[International Organizations Division]] (IOD) and ex-executive secretary of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] said in an interview, \"I think it was the most important division that the agency had, and I think that it played an enormous role in the Cold War.\"<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html Modern Art was a CIA 'Weapon'] Retrieved September 4, 2013</ref>\n\nAgainst this revisionist tradition, an essay by [[Michael Kimmelman]], chief art critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', called ''Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War'', argues that much of that information concerning what was happening on the American art scene during the 1940s and 50s, as well as the revisionists' interpretation of it, is flatly false or, at best, decontextualized, contrary to the revisionists' avowed historiographic principles.<ref name=kimmelman>{{cite book|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|last2=Frascina|first2=Francis, ed.|title=Pollock and After: The Critical Debate|chapter=Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415228664|pages=294\u2013306|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNzRUNbKKA4C&pg=PA294}}</ref> Other books on the subject include ''Art in the Cold War'', by Christine Lindey, which also describes the art of the Soviet Union at the same time, and ''Pollock and After'', edited by Francis Frascina, which reprinted the Kimmelman article.\n\n== Consequences ==\n\n[[File:Jean-Paul Riopelle, 1951, Untitled, oil on canvas, 54 x 64.7 cm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], 1951, ''Untitled'', oil on canvas, 54 x 64.7 cm (21 1/4 x 25 1/2 in.), private collection]]\n[[Canadians|Canadian]] painter [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] (1923\u20132002), a member of the Montreal-based surrealist-inspired group [[Les Automatistes]], helped introduce a related style of [[abstract impressionism]] to the Parisian art world from 1949. [[Michel Tapi\u00e9]]'s groundbreaking book, ''Un Art Autre'' (1952), was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapi\u00e9 was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement's initial affect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded [[Tachisme]], [[Color Field painting]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Neo-expressionism]], and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with [[Hard-edge painting]] ([[Frank Stella]], [[Robert Indiana]] and others) and [[Pop Art|Pop artists]], notably [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] in Britain. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art. [[Minimalism]] was exemplified by artists such as [[Donald Judd]], [[Robert Mangold]] and [[Agnes Martin]].\n\nHowever, many painters, such as [[Jules Olitski]], [[Joan Mitchell]] and [[Antoni T\u00e0pies]] continued to work in the abstract expressionist style for many years, extending and expanding its visual and philosophical implications, as many abstract artists continue to do today, in styles described as [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-expressionist]] and others.\n\nIn the years after World War II, a group of New York artists started one of the first true schools of artists in America, bringing about a new era in American artwork: abstract expressionism. This led to the American art boom that brought about styles such as [[Pop Art]]. This also helped to make [[New York City|New York]] into a cultural and artistic hub.<ref name=\"New York and Abstract Expressionism\">{{cite web|title=Abstract Expressionist New York|url=http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1085?locale=en|publisher=MoMA|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Abstract Expressionists value the organism over the static whole, becoming over being, expression over perfection, vitality over finish, fluctuation over repose, feeling over formulation, the unknown over the known, the veiled over the clear, the individual over society and the inner over the outer.<ref>Dore Ashton, ''American Art Since 1945'', Oxford University Press, 1982, p. 37, {{ISBN|0195203593}}</ref>|William C.

Seldom does a painter have such control over intense color -- for example ion 'No.6 (Montauk),' in which the sharpness of complementary contrasts is subtly muted and harmonized. Complex interactive layering animates the painted surfaces, which often conceal as much as they reveal. Organic and calligraphic shapes jockey for position, yet are held firmly in place by implicit structure. These are not mere virtuoso formal exercises, however; their emotional undercurrents are as strong as their technical qualities. }}</ref>\n* [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]]<ref>[https://www.nortonsimon.org/art/detail/P.1973.14 Norton Simon Museum]</ref>\n* [[Phillip Pavia]]<ref>[https://ctstatelibrary.org/pavia-phillip/ CT State Library]</ref>\n* [[Jackson Pollock]]<ref name=\"metmuseum.org\"/>\n* [[Fuller Potter]]\n* [[Richard Pousette-Dart]]<ref name=\"metmuseum.org\"/>\n* [[Ad Reinhardt]]<ref>[https://americanart.si.edu/artist/ad-reinhardt-3993 Smithsonian American Art Museum]</ref>\n* [[Milton Resnick]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/19/arts/milton-resnick-abstract-expressionist-painter-dies-at-87.html NY Times]</ref>\n* [[Robert Richenburg]]\n* [[George Rickey]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/21/nyregion/george-rickey-sculptor-whose-works-moved-dies-at-95.html NY Times]</ref>\n* [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]]<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/16/local/me-passings16.1 LA Times]</ref>\n* [[William Ronald]]<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Ronald Britannica]</ref>\n* [[James Rosati]]\n* [[Ralph Rosenborg]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.caldwellgallery.com/bios/rosenborg_biography.html |title=Ralph Rosenborg Biography |format= |work=Caldwell Gallery  |author=Zenobia Grant Wingate |accessdate=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n* [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]]<ref>[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/picturing-the-american-century-59969078/ Smithsonian]</ref>\n* [[Mark Rothko]]<ref name=\"metmuseum.org\"/>\n* [[Anne Ryan]]<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/art/anne-ryan The New Yorker]</ref>\n* [[Louis Schanker]]\n* [[Jon Schueler]]\n* [[Charles Seliger]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/arts/design/09seliger.html NY Times]</ref>\n* [[Harold Shapinsky]]\n* [[Thomas Sills]]\n* [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]]<ref>[https://www.widewalls.ch/artist/david-smith/ Widewalls]</ref>\n* [[Theodoros Stamos]]<ref>[http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/stamos-bio.htm The Phillips Collection]</ref>\n* [[Richard Stankiewicz]]<ref>[http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/stankiewicz_richard.html Artcyclopedia]</ref>\n* [[Joe Stefanelli (painter)|Joe Stefanelli]]<ref>[https://inliquid.org/reviews/joe-stefanelli/ J.Stein ''Stefanelli The Fifties to the Present'']</ref>\n* [[Hedda Sterne]]<ref>[http://artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=2&int_new=46430 Art Daily, ''Hedda Sterne, America's Last Original Abstract Expressionist and Sole Woman in the Group, Dies''] Retrieved April 10, 2011</ref>\n* [[Clyfford Still]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Clyfford Still|url=http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/still-bio.htm|website=The Phillips Collection|accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref>  \n* [[George Stillman]]<ref>[http://www.marinscope.com/sausalito_marin_scope/opinion/sausalito-historical-society-the-sausalito-six/article_9a0df845-a95d-5ae5-b25e-1ba57851fbb6.html Sausalito historical society]</ref>\n* [[Reuben Tam]]\n* [[Alma Thomas]]<ref>[https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/living-color-0 American Magazine]</ref>\n* [[Mark Tobey]]<ref>[http://www.mark-tobey.com/ Art directory]</ref>\n* [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]]<ref>[http://www.phillipscollection.org/research/american_art/bios/tomlin-bio.htm Phillips Collection]</ref>\n* [[Cy Twombly]]<ref>Matt Schudel (July 6, 2011), [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/cy-twombly-influential-va-born-abstract-artist-dies-at-83/2011/07/05/gHQAmHwmzH_story.html Cy Twombly, influential Va.-born abstract artist, dies at 83] ''Washington Post''.</ref>\n* [[Jack Tworkov]]<ref>[http://www.artnet.com/artists/jack-tworkov/ Artnet]</ref>\n* [[Esteban Vicente]]<ref name=\"nyto\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/12/arts/esteban-vicente-dies-at-97-an-abstract-expressionist.html|title=Esteban Vicente Dies at 97; An Abstract Expressionist|last=SMITH|first=ROBERTA|date=2001-01-12|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Peter Voulkos]]<ref>\"[https://www.famsf.org/blog/framework-untitled-stack-peter-voulkos Untitled (Stack) by Peter Voulkos]\" (February&nbsp;1, 2012).

The parts were later assembled in a Mahindra plant under the Mahindra badge, being a well-known brand in India.

The mHawk employs a top-mounted [[intercooler]] to improve [[turbocharger]] efficiency. The engine is based on the Bosch Common Rail system with solenoid injectors and fuel spray design that improves fuel efficiency. The mHawk is equipped with a two chain drive stage system and hydraulic lash adjusters.\n\nA variable geometry turbocharger controls the boost. The compressed air is cooled by intercooler which is mounted upstream of the turbocharger. The compression ratio ranges from 16.5:1 to 18.5:1.\n\n==First Generation (2002-present)==\nThe Mahindra Scorpio was first launched in India on 20 June 2002.

His senior, Pawan Goenka, a former engineer at [[General Motors|GM]], heads Mahindra's automotive division and oversees the Scorpio project.
