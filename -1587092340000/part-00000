Seventh Emergency Special Session on \u201cThe Question of Palestine\u201d adopted eight resolutions (ES-7/2 through ES-7/9) calling for the unconditional and total withdrawal of Israel from territories occupied since 1967.\n\n==== Namibia (1981) - France, UK and US veto - 8th Emergency Special Session ====\nInvoked by General Assembly at the request of Zimbabwe (A/ES-8/1).

In 1918, The Cambridge School for Girls merged with the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]-based [[Haskell School (Boston, Massachusetts)|Haskell School]], and was renamed The Cambridge-Haskell School. [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]-born poet [[Kahlil Gibran]], an \u201cintimate friend\u201d of headmistress [[Mary Haskell (educator)|Mary Haskell]], designed a ring for her students depicting a \u201cflower\u201d \u201cgrowing\u201d in an open \u201chand.\u201d<ref>[http://www.csw.org/page/about/history/1886 The Cambridge School of Weston- About CSW- History- 1886\u20131918] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406193203/http://www.csw.org/page/about/history/1886 |date=April 6, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, the school was moved {{convert|20|mi|km}} to its present campus in Weston under the direction of then-head of school John French, became [[coeducational]], and was renamed a final time as The Cambridge School of Weston (CSW). A follower of educational reformer [[John Dewey]], French put in place many of the [[progressive education]]al underpinnings that still guide the school, such as a focus on the whole student, [[experiential learning]], community involvement, and a low student-to-faculty ratio. In 1939, the school implemented a form of community self-governance modeled after the traditional [[New England]] [[town meeting]]. Following [[Robert's Rules of Order]], the entire school community, including students, meet to propose and debate school rules and policies, elect representatives to school committees, and decide on other relevant topics to the community. The Cambridge School Town Meeting continues to be a central part of the school's [[community governance]] to the present day.\n\n== Academics ==\nThe school has gained recognition as a pioneer of the [[Modular scheduling|Module System]], implemented in 1973 by then Head of School Bob Sandoe.\n\nThe goal of the Module, or \"Mod\" System, is to provide a framework to allow students to focus on fewer subjects more intensively during a given term. The academic year is divided into six terms (known as modules) of six weeks apiece. A school day consists of four class blocks of 90 minutes each, with some classes spanning several consecutive blocks. Students take up to three academic and one extracurricular class per mod. Some classes, such as those in mathematics or a foreign language, continue for multiple mods. No two students have the same schedule; every student's schedule is unique to themselves. Students submit what classes they would like to enroll in, and the faculty works on their schedule to fit their electives into their schedule, along with the required classes each class must participate in.\n\n== Tuition ==\nThe Cambridge School of Weston's tuition for the 2019-2020 school year is $63,000 for boarding and $50,900 for day students.<ref>https://www.csw.org/admissions/tuition-and-financial-aid/tuition-and-fees</ref> About 25% of students receive financial aid.<ref>https://www.csw.org/admissions/tuition-and-financial-aid/faqs</ref>\n\n==Initiatives==\nThe Cambridge School of Weston finished building a Green building called the Garthwaite Center for Science and Art, with a dedication ceremony and day of environmental education events on October 20, 2007. \n\n== Athletics ==\n\nThe Cambridge School of Weston offers the following interscholastic sports:<ref>https://www.csw.org/athletics/interscholastic-sports</ref>\n* [[Association football|Soccer]]\n* [[Cross country running]]\n* [[Field hockey]]\n* [[Basketball]]\n* [[Baseball]]\n* [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]]\n* [[Volleyball]]\n* [[Tennis]]\n* Girls' [[lacrosse]]\n\nAdditional fitness courses offered include:<ref>https://www.csw.org/athletics/recreation-and-wellness-activities</ref>\n\n* [[Yoga]]\n* [[Rock climbing]]\n* [[Fencing]]\n* [[Bicycling]]\n* [[Weight training]] \n* [[Golf]] \n* [[Table tennis]]\n* [[Dance]] \n* [[Martial arts]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Squirrel Flower|Ella Williams]], singer-songwriter\n* [[Wet (band)]], lead singer\n* [[Miguel Arteta]], director\n*[[Hilaria Baldwin]]\n* [[Louisa Bertman]], illustrator\n* [[Josh Clayton-Felt]], singer-songwriter\n* [[Andras Jones]], actor, singer-songwriter\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]], actress\n* [[Robert M.

In 1918, The Cambridge School for Girls merged with the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]-based [[Haskell School (Boston, Massachusetts)|Haskell School]], and was renamed The Cambridge-Haskell School. [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]-born poet [[Kahlil Gibran]], an \u201cintimate friend\u201d of headmistress [[Mary Haskell (educator)|Mary Haskell]], designed a ring for her students depicting a \u201cflower\u201d \u201cgrowing\u201d in an open \u201chand.\u201d<ref>[http://www.csw.org/page/about/history/1886 The Cambridge School of Weston- About CSW- History- 1886\u20131918] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406193203/http://www.csw.org/page/about/history/1886 |date=April 6, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, the school was moved {{convert|20|mi|km}} to its present campus in Weston under the direction of then-head of school John French, became [[coeducational]], and was renamed a final time as The Cambridge School of Weston (CSW). A follower of educational reformer [[John Dewey]], French put in place many of the [[progressive education]]al underpinnings that still guide the school, such as a focus on the whole student, [[experiential learning]], community involvement, and a low student-to-faculty ratio. In 1939, the school implemented a form of community self-governance modeled after the traditional [[New England]] [[town meeting]]. Following [[Robert's Rules of Order]], the entire school community, including students, meet to propose and debate school rules and policies, elect representatives to school committees, and decide on other relevant topics to the community. The Cambridge School Town Meeting continues to be a central part of the school's [[community governance]] to the present day.\n\n== Academics ==\nThe school has gained recognition as a pioneer of the [[Modular scheduling|Module System]], implemented in 1973 by then Head of School Bob Sandoe.\n\nThe goal of the Module, or \"Mod\" System, is to provide a framework to allow students to focus on fewer subjects more intensively during a given term.

She stated: \"If you are more popular with the fans, companies are more likely to book you for their production\", \"Being nominated for awards help build your recognition with your fan base.

{"title_page": "Private ski area (North America)", "text_new": "[[Image:Ski resorts in the world.png|240px|thumb|Ski resorts in the World by country]]\n\nA '''private ski area''' is a membership based type of [[ski resort]] developed primarily for [[skiing]], [[snowboarding]], and other [[winter sports]]. Like a [[country club]], private ski areas in North America offer exclusive memberships, usually based on an initiation fee and annual dues.<ref name=\"nytimes\">Kirsner, Scott [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/20/travel/havens-member-only-ski-areas-no-crowds.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm \"Havens; Member-Only Ski Areas: No Crowds\"], ''The New York Times'', February 20, 2004</ref> In this context, it is the presence of exclusive memberships rather than private ownership that makes a ski area private.\n\nPrivate ski areas offer a range of public access.

The player controls a researcher researching the local environment and nearby Alien Facility, on planet dubbed '4546B'.\n\n== Plot (Current Story) ==\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' takes place two years after the ending of [[Subnautica]]. Alterra has placed the Vesper Station into orbit around 4546B for research. The Player is told to head too the nearby Mountain Alien Facility in order to locate Serik Jevov (Jeff). The player then encounters the voice of one of The Architects, letting the player know that Jeff is gone, the Alien Facility then gets locked off and requires a White Tablet to enter. The Alien Facility is then struck by a meteor and is re-routing its power to Sanctuary. The player is told to get to the escape ship back at base, however, the ship takes off, and the player has to take shelter in Research Base Zero. After the meteor shower triggers an Avalanche, the ice breaks below the player causing them to have to swim out into open water, and head to a Lifepod launched by Sam Goodall on the Vesper Station, just before The Vesper is struck by a meteorite damaging its communications. \n\nShortly after, the player receives a message tracked to the Alien Sanctuary Site in the Twist Bridges. Once the player is exploring the Underwater Alien Facility, they are threatened by an Alien voice saying that its storage medium is failing. As the player reaches the inner of the Alien Facility, it notes that is has found an \"adequate storage medium\". The player offers their PDA for the consciousnesses to transfer into, however, it transfers into the players Cerebral Cortex. The Alien Voice then lets the player knows its name is Al-an.\n\nAs the player approaches Rocket Island, their PDA informs them that repairing the communications tower will reestablish contact with The Vesper, requiring The Player to explore the Mercury II wreck, a ship that crashed anywhere from 30 to 100 years ago. After The Player repairs the communications tower, they are told the ship that took off at the beginning of the game crash landed in the Glacial Basin and that they have three objectives: Find Jeff, extract a sample of the Kharaa sample and retrieve research data from Research Base Omega.\n\nIn the Glacial Basin, the player finds the crashed escape ship. The player is able to locate Jeff's base in the Glacial Basin, and is informed that Jeff is most likely in another sector. The Player is then told to head to the Leviathan Genetic Research Program to receive a sample of the Kharaa Bacterium and send it up to The Vesper. As the player explores the Glacial Basin, they find a Cache with one of The Architect body parts.  A while after the player sends the Kharaa Bacterium, they get a message saying that it never arrived. The player then gets a supply drop in the Lilypad Islands leading them towards Research Base Omega. Throughout the players adventures, they find two more caches, each containing one of the other parts to The Architect's body. When the player arrives in the Fabricator Base, they are told that they are able to construct Al-an a body and transfer his consciousness back into it.\n\nThe Player gets contacted by Sam to be told that The Vesper's supply of Enzyme 42 deteriorated overnight and that they need a sample from a nearby Sea Emperor Leviathan. As the player sends the Enzyme up to The Vesper, an Architect shield covers the planet causing the rocket containing the cure to explode. The Player then calls Robin and the Mission director about what happened, Jeff then joins the call and says his intention to hold the Vesper crew hostage as they are most likely exposed to the Kharaa bacterium, alongside The Player being trapped on the surface. The Player then learns from Al-an that they need to head to the Mountain Alien Facility \n\n'''From here on, the Story is not implemented, and won't be. Anything after the player enters the Alien Facility is not confirmed to have been the ending.''' \n\nAfter the player receives the White tablet to enter the facility, they head to the Alien Facility and enter it.  The game ends with The Vesper station being blown up. \n\n\n\n== Plot (New Story) ==\n\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' takes place two years after the ending of Subnautica. Alterra is funding a smaller company called XenoWorks, which the player works for. The Player heads down on a shuttle to the surface of 4546B trying to \"cover from Alterra satellites\" to find their sister, Sam. On the way down, a meteor crashes into the player causing their lifepod to deploy and them to crash land in Sector Zero.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/ Official Website]\n\n{{uncategorised|date=April 2020}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2019 video game}}\n{{Multiple issues|{{copy edit|date=April 2020}}{{Sources exist|date=April 2020}}{{Confusing|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2018}}\n\n'''''Subnautica Below Zero''''' is an [[open-world]] [[Survival game|survival]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed and published by [[Unknown Worlds Entertainment]].\n\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' was first released in [[early access]] for Microsoft Windows and MacOS in January 2019, Unknown Worlds has developed a prequel to ''Subnautica Below Zero'', called ''[[Subnautica]]'' which was released fully in January 2018.\n\nThe current story is written by [[Tom Jubert]], with the new story being written by Jill Murray. {{Infobox video game\n| title = Subnautica Below Zero\n| image = \n| caption = \n| developer = [[Unknown Worlds Entertainment]]\n| publisher = Unknown Worlds Entertainment\n| director = Charlie Cleveland\n| producer = \n| designer = \n| programmer = \n| artist = {{Unbulleted list|Cory Strader|Brian Cummings|Scott MacDonald\n<ref name=\"Crew\">{{cite web|last=Jeremy|first=Hugh|title=The Crew of Subnautica|url=http://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/the-crew-of-subnautica/|publisher=[[Unknown Worlds Entertainment]]|date=December 17, 2013|access-date=April 9, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417144732/http://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/the-crew-of-subnautica/|archive-date=April 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n| writer = [[Tom Jubert]]\n| composer =\n| engine = [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]\n| platforms = {{Unbulleted list|[[Microsoft Windows]]|[[MacOS]]}}\n| released = \n| genre = {{hlist|[[Action-adventure game|Action-adventure]]|[[survival game|survival]]}}\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n}}\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' is a [[Survival game|survival]], [[Adventure game|adventure]] game set in an [[open world]] environment and played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]].

Income was generated from rentals of static holiday caravans and touring pitches, alongside caravan and holiday home sales and on-site retail.\n\nPark Resorts employed over 3,500 people during the peak holiday season, including the support team at their head office in [[Hemel Hempstead]], [[Hertfordshire]]. Park Resorts had over 16,000 caravan or holiday home owners and over 1 million holidaymakers visited their parks each year.\n\nIn 2015, Park Resorts merged with [[Parkdean Holidays]], another UK holiday park operator, to form [[Parkdean Resorts]]. The new company now operates 71 holiday parks across the UK after acquiring Vauxhall Holiday Park in [[Great Yarmouth]]. Park Resorts and Parkdean operated separately throughout 2016 before launching a new website and rebranding all the parks as [[Parkdean Resorts]].\n\n== History ==\n\nPark Resorts was created in March 2001 when CBPE ([[Close Brothers Group|Close Brothers]] Private Equity), in partnership with a [[management buyout]] team of three led by David Vaughan, purchased twelve [[Haven Holidays|Haven]] freehold caravan parks from [[Bourne Leisure|Bourne Leisure Ltd]].

[[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) teams will take turns selecting amateur United States [[college basketball]] players and other eligible players, including international players. It will be televised nationally on [[NBA on ESPN|ESPN]]. The lottery will take place in May 2020.\n\n==Trades involving draft picks==\n===Pre-draft trades===\nPrior to the day of the draft, the following trades were made and resulted in exchanges of draft picks between the teams. Trade details to follow.\n\n===Draft-day trades===\nDraft-day trades will be made on the day of the draft.\n\n==Combine==\n{{main|NBA Draft Combine}}\nThe invitation-only [[NBA Draft Combine]] and its on-court element will be held in May.\n\n==Draft lottery==\n{{main|NBA draft lottery}}\n\nThe NBA conducts an annual lottery to determine the draft order for the teams that did not make the playoffs in the preceding season. Every NBA team that missed the NBA playoffs have a chance at winning a top four pick, but teams with worse records have a better chance at winning a top four pick, effective as of the 2019 draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/09/28/nba-board-governors-approves-changes-draft-lottery-system|title=\nNBA Board of Governors approves changes to draft lottery system|website=NBA.com|date=September 28, 2017}}</ref> After the lottery selects the teams that receive a top four pick, the other teams receive an NBA draft pick based on their winning percentage from the prior season. As it is commonplace in the event of identical win-loss records, the NBA will perform a random drawing to break the ties. The lottery will take place in May.\n\n==Eligibility and entrants==\n{{main|Eligibility for the NBA draft}}\n\nThe draft is conducted under the eligibility rules established in the league's 2017 [[NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement|collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA) with its player's union. The previous CBA that ended the [[2011 NBA lockout|2011 lockout]] instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but called for a committee of owners and players to discuss future changes.\n\n*All drafted players must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft. In terms of dates, players who are eligible for the 2020 draft must be born on or before December 31, 2001.\n*Since the 2016 draft, the following rules, as implemented by the [[NCAA Division I]] council for that division, are:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/14564613/date-nba-draft-commitment-pushed-may |title=College players given extra time to mull NBA draft decision |first=Jeff |last=Goodman |website=ESPN.com |date=January 13, 2016}}</ref>\n**Declaration for the draft no longer results in automatic loss of college eligibility. As long as a player does not sign a contract with a professional team outside the NBA, or sign with an agent, he will retain college eligibility as long as he makes a timely withdrawal from the draft.\n**NCAA players now have until 10 days after the end of the [[NBA Draft Combine]] to withdraw from the draft. Since the combine is held in mid-May, the current deadline is about five weeks after the previous mid-April deadline.\n**NCAA players may participate in the draft combine, and are allowed to attend one tryout per year with each NBA team without losing college eligibility.\n**NCAA players may now enter and withdraw from the draft up to two times without loss of eligibility. Previously, the NCAA treated a second declaration of draft eligibility as a permanent loss of college eligibility.\n\nThe NBA has since expanded the draft combine to include players with remaining college eligibility (who, like players without college eligibility, can only attend by invitation).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13142145/ncaa-proposes-new-nba-draft-rule-allow-underclassmen-return-school |title=NCAA proposes new NBA draft rule to allow early entrants back in school |first=Andy |last=Katz |authorlink=Andy Katz |publisher=ESPN.com |date=June 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Early entrants===\nPlayers who are not automatically eligible have to declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than 60 days before the draft. For the 2020 draft, the date will fall on April 26. After that date, \"early entry\" players are able to attend NBA pre-draft camps and individual team workouts to show off their skills and obtain feedback regarding their draft positions. Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration date, which is 10 days before the draft. Under current NCAA rules, players have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility.\n\nA player who has hired an agent retains his remaining college eligibility regardless of whether he is drafted after an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee. Underclassmen who declare for the NBA draft and are not selected have the opportunity to return to their school for at least another year only after terminating all agreements with their agents, who must be certified no later than August 1, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flexibility for going pro and getting a degree |url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/flexibility-going-pro-and-getting-degree

It will take place at [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]]. [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) teams will take turns selecting amateur United States [[college basketball]] players and other eligible players, including international players. It will be televised nationally on [[NBA on ESPN|ESPN]]. The lottery will take place in May 2020.\n\n==Trades involving draft picks==\n===Pre-draft trades===\nPrior to the day of the draft, the following trades were made and resulted in exchanges of draft picks between the teams.

Every NBA team that missed the NBA playoffs have a chance at winning a top four pick, but teams with worse records have a better chance at winning a top four pick, effective as of the 2019 draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/09/28/nba-board-governors-approves-changes-draft-lottery-system|title=\nNBA Board of Governors approves changes to draft lottery system|website=NBA.com|date=September 28, 2017}}</ref> After the lottery selects the teams that receive a top four pick, the other teams receive an NBA draft pick based on their winning percentage from the prior season. As it is commonplace in the event of identical win-loss records, the NBA will perform a random drawing to break the ties. The lottery will take place in May.\n\n==Eligibility and entrants==\n{{main|Eligibility for the NBA draft}}\n\nThe draft is conducted under the eligibility rules established in the league's 2017 [[NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement|collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA) with its player's union. The previous CBA that ended the [[2011 NBA lockout|2011 lockout]] instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but called for a committee of owners and players to discuss future changes.\n\n*All drafted players must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft. In terms of dates, players who are eligible for the 2020 draft must be born on or before December 31, 2001.\n*Since the 2016 draft, the following rules, as implemented by the [[NCAA Division I]] council for that division, are:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/14564613/date-nba-draft-commitment-pushed-may |title=College players given extra time to mull NBA draft decision |first=Jeff |last=Goodman |website=ESPN.com |date=January 13, 2016}}</ref>\n**Declaration for the draft no longer results in automatic loss of college eligibility. As long as a player does not sign a contract with a professional team outside the NBA, or sign with an agent, he will retain college eligibility as long as he makes a timely withdrawal from the draft.\n**NCAA players now have until 10 days after the end of the [[NBA Draft Combine]] to withdraw from the draft. Since the combine is held in mid-May, the current deadline is about five weeks after the previous mid-April deadline.\n**NCAA players may participate in the draft combine, and are allowed to attend one tryout per year with each NBA team without losing college eligibility.\n**NCAA players may now enter and withdraw from the draft up to two times without loss of eligibility. Previously, the NCAA treated a second declaration of draft eligibility as a permanent loss of college eligibility.\n\nThe NBA has since expanded the draft combine to include players with remaining college eligibility (who, like players without college eligibility, can only attend by invitation).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13142145/ncaa-proposes-new-nba-draft-rule-allow-underclassmen-return-school |title=NCAA proposes new NBA draft rule to allow early entrants back in school |first=Andy |last=Katz |authorlink=Andy Katz |publisher=ESPN.com |date=June 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Early entrants===\nPlayers who are not automatically eligible have to declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than 60 days before the draft. For the 2020 draft, the date will fall on April 26. After that date, \"early entry\" players are able to attend NBA pre-draft camps and individual team workouts to show off their skills and obtain feedback regarding their draft positions. Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration date, which is 10 days before the draft. Under current NCAA rules, players have until 10 days after the draft combine to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility.\n\nA player who has hired an agent retains his remaining college eligibility regardless of whether he is drafted after an evaluation from the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee. Underclassmen who declare for the NBA draft and are not selected have the opportunity to return to their school for at least another year only after terminating all agreements with their agents, who must be certified no later than August 1, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flexibility for going pro and getting a degree |url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/flexibility-going-pro-and-getting-degree
