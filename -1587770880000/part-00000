Opened in 1883 and demolished in 1967, it was the first home of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] Company.\n\n==History==\n\nSometimes referred to as \"the old Met\", the Metropolitan Opera House opened on October 22, 1883, with a performance of ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''. It was located at 1411 Broadway, occupying the whole block between West 39th Street and West 40th Street on the west side of the street in the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] of [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Nicknamed \"The Yellow Brick Brewery\" for its industrial looking exterior, the original Metropolitan Opera House was designed by [[J. Cleaveland Cady]]. On August 27, 1892, the nine-year-old theater was gutted by fire. The 1892\u221293 season was canceled while the opera house was rebuilt along its original lines. During that season, the Vaudeville Club, which eventually became the [[Metropolitan Opera Club]], was founded and hosted entertainment in the undamaged portions of the house.\n\nIn 1903, architects [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings]] extensively redesigned the interior of the opera house. The familiar golden auditorium with its sunburst chandelier, and curved [[proscenium]] inscribed with the names of six composers ([[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]), dates from this time. The first of the Met's signature gold [[damask]] stage curtains was installed in 1906, completing the look that the old Metropolitan Opera House maintained until its closing.\n\n[[File:Metropolitan Opera House program cover 1935.jpg|thumb|left|Metropolitan Opera House program cover depicting the [[proscenium|Proscenium arch]] in 1935]]\nIn 1940, ownership of the opera house shifted from the wealthy families who occupied the theater's boxes to the non-profit Metropolitan Opera Association. At this time the last major change to the auditorium's interior was completed. The second tier of privately held boxes (the \"grand tier\") was converted into standard row seating. This enlarged the seating capacity and left only the first tier of boxes from the \"golden horseshoe\" of the opera house's origins as a showplace for New York society.\n\nThe Met had a seating capacity of 3,625 with 224 standing room places.\n\nWhile the theater was noted for its excellent acoustics and elegant interior, as early as the 1900s the backstage facilities were deemed to be severely inadequate for a large opera company. Scenery and sets were a regular sight leaning against the building exterior on 39th Street where crews had to shift them between performances. Various plans were put forward over the years to build a new home for the company and designs for new opera houses were created by various architects including [[Joseph Urban]]. Proposed new locations included [[Columbus Circle]] and what is now [[Rockefeller Center]], but none of these plans came to fruition. Only with the development of [[Lincoln Center]] on New York's [[Upper West Side]] did the Met finally have the opportunity to build a modern opera house.\n\nThe Metropolitan Opera said goodbye to its old house on April 16, 1966, with a sentimental gala farewell performance featuring nearly all of the company's current leading artists. Long-time Met star soprano [[Zinka Milanov]] made her last Met appearance that night, and among the many invited guests was soprano [[Anna Case]], who had made her debut at the house in 1909. The final performance at the opera house was given not by the Met, but by the [[Bolshoi Ballet]], which concluded a short run of appearances on May 8, 1966.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ballet: Our Revels Now Are Ended at the Old Metropolitan; Bolshoi Gives House Its Last Performance Hurok Invites Dancers of the Past for Finale|url=https://article.archive.nytimes.com/1966/05/09/82433033.pdf|last=Barnes|first=Clive|authorlink=Clive Barnes|date=May 9, 1966|page=48|work=[[The New York Times]]|url-access=subscription}}</ref> The theater was purchased by [[Jack D.

The two finalists faced off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who lost to one of the two finalists moved into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consisted of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scored more points in each round was the winner of that rounds; the bout finished when one wrestler had won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are

''Drepanosaurus'' is a genus of Drepanosauridae, a group of diapsid reptiles known for their prehensile tails. Only one adult ''Drepanosaurus'' specimen and two immature specimens have ever been found and all lacked a head and neck. ''Drepanosaurus'' was probably an insectivore, and lived in a coastal environment in what is now modern day Italy, as well as in a streamside environment in the midwestern United States.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Drepanosaurus BW.jpg|left|thumb|Restoration]]\n\nIn general, drepanosaurs can be characterized as having long, gracile necks with a lightly built triangular skull that superficially resembles those of birds. They also have heavy bodies, with fused vertebrae up into a ridge over their shoulders. Their limbs can be described as chameleon-like with grasping hands and feet. Their long tails are tall and narrow with the possibility of containing a tail tip that has been modified into a claw.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feduccia|first=A.|last2=Wild|first2=R.|date=1993|title=Birdlike characters in the Triassic archosaur Megalancosaurus|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01149272|journal=Naturwissenschaften|language=en|volume=80|issue=12|pages=564\u2013566|doi=10.1007/BF01149272|issn=1432-1904|via=}}</ref>\n\n''Drepanosaurus'' is known to have a huge claw on the index finger of each hand along with the tail claw. The skull of ''Drepanosaurus'' has never been found and is still unknown, however, the skulls of other drepanosaurs like ''Megalancosaurus'' give us an idea of what the skull of ''Drepanosaurus'' might look like. Looking at ''Megalancosaurus's'' skull shows that the claws of each index finger were probably the size of the entire head of ''Drepanosaurus'' and a bird like jaw and head shape.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/taxa/verts/archosaurs/drepanosauromorpha.php|title=Drepanosauromorpha, the \"monkey lizards\"|last=Wedel|first=M.|date=2007|website=ucmp.berkeley.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe forelimb of ''Drepanosaurus'' is highly modified compared to other vertebrates and very robust. Its [[ulna]] was altered from being a forearm bone into an odd crescent shaped site for muscle attachment. The role played by the ulna in most [[tetrapod]]s is replaced by an elongated [[carpal]] bone. Additional musculature would be attached to the high [[withers]] that characterized ''Drepanosaurus'' and its close relatives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=J.D.|last2=Downs|first2=A.|date=2002|title=A drepanosaurid pectoral girdle from the Ghost Ranch (Whitaker) Coelophysis Quarry (Chinle Group, Rock Point Formation, Rhaetian), New Mexico|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1671/0272-4634%282002%29022%5B0070%3AADPGFT%5D2.0.CO%3B2|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=22|issue=1|pages=70\u201375|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0070:ADPGFT]2.0.CO;2|issn=0272-4634|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus tail.JPG|thumb|Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus tail]]\n\nA clue to the purpose of these large muscles can be found on its hand. The animal's \"index finger\" bore a large claw reminiscent of those born by dinosaurs such as ''[[Noasaurus]]'' and ''[[Baryonyx]]''. However it is more likely that ''Drepanosaurus'' used its claw like the modern [[pygmy anteater]], tearing through bark and insect nests to find invertebrate prey. Some researchers have forwarded the more far-fetched proposal that the claw was used to excavate burrows, but this is not unanimously agreed upon.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Renest\u00f2|first=S.|last2=Fraser|first2=N.C.|date=2010|title=Drepanosaurid (Reptilia: Diapsida) remains from a Late Triassic fissure infilling at Cromhall Quarry (Avon, Great Britain)|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1671/A1101?casa_token=FiVemZxVKYoAAAAA%3AOApB4IKlf9B0xC6EOqD_OA_Qjd-VBYKMzs04dUBaCJcOmPSlfNE4U9kMOuEqeWMhVxsvVNq_4SRd&|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1671/A1101|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe dorsal neural spine humps of ''Drepanosaurus'' are much taller along all succeeding spines reaching down to the sacrum. Sacral and anterior caudal neural spines are very low if present at all and neural spines are elongated showing expanded dorsal margins after those areas. The scapula was robust with a 70 degree bend. The humerus and radius were short while the ulna was replaced by an ulnare and shifted to the elbow taking a disc-like form. This skeletal configuration change is thought to have been from the large claw on digit II requiring a large muscle in order to operate. The pelvis was large with the pubis forming the majority of the ventral portion. The hind limbs of ''Drepanosaurus'' were much larger than the forelimbs with the tibia and fibula being broadly separated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Renest\u00f2|first=S.|date=1994|title=The shoulder girdle and anterior limb of Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus (Reptilia, Neodiapsida) from the upper Triassic (Norian) of Northern Italy|url=https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/111/3/247/2691415|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|language=en|volume=111|issue=3|pages=247\u2013264|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1994.tb01485.x|issn=0024-4082|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Discovery and classification==\nDiscovered in northern Italy in 1979, ''Drepanosaurus'' was named by ''Giovanni Pinna'', a Professor in Paleontology and museologist. ''Drepanosaurus'' is a rare fossil and the one adult specimen found is incomplete. Another partial specimen of ''Drepanosaurus'' was found in [[New Mexico|New Mexico's]] [[Chinle Formation]] in 2016. ''Drepanosaurus'' is part of the clade [[Drepanosauridae]], which is nested in the larger clade [[Drepanosauromorpha]]. Drepanosauromorphs are sometimes considered part of the group [[Protorosauria]] which may or may not be a natural group (i.e., monophyletic). In any case, it is clear that drepanosaurs are [[diapsid]] [[reptiles]]. The species name is ''Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Senter|first=P.|date=2004|title=Phylogeny of Drepanosauridae (Reptilia: Diapsida)|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/S1477201904001427|journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology|volume=2|issue=3|pages=257\u2013268|doi=10.1017/S1477201904001427|issn=1477-2019|via=}}</ref>\n\nIts name is Greek for \"sickle lizard\".\n\n==Paleobiology==\n[[File:Vallesaurus cenensis.JPG|thumb|''[[Vallesaurus]]'', a relative of ''Drepanosaurus'' with the skull preserved]]''Drepanosaurus'' is hypothesized to have been an insectivore, using those large claws on the second digits to lift bark and dig into crevices and grooves on trees to find insects. It is considered that ''Drepanosaurus'' was also a digging animal and could use the tail as a tool for unearthing insects. Concerns about whether ''Drepanosaurus's'' tail was flexible enough to be used for digging are still brought up today, especially since many characteristics point to ''Drepanosaurus'' being primarily a tree-dwelling animal.\n\n==Paleoecology==\nBeing only 45 to 50&nbsp;cm in length, ''Drepanosaurus'' spent its time in trees using its gripping chameleon-like hands and feet to climb from branch to branch as well as its long tail to help wrap around branches. This hypothesized behavioral characteristic brings the notion of \"monkey-like\" to ''Drepanosaurus''. The tail also provided extra support along with the claw at the tip to help grip branches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pinna|first=G.|date=1980|title=Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus, nuovo genere e nuova specie di Lepidosauro del trias alpino|url=|journal=Atti della Soc ital di sci nat del mus civ di storia nat di Milano|volume=121|pages=181-192|via=}}</ref> ''Drepanosaurus'' would be found in wooded environments and ecosystems in what is now Northern Italy. Relatives have been found in other parts of Italy and New Mexico and New Jersey as well, in similar woodlands. ''Drepanosaurus'' is much larger than its relatives, more than double the length of ''Megalancosaurus''. All drepanosaurs are thought to be tree-dwelling insectivores with similar body structures to ''Drepanosaurus'', except for minor differences usually dealing with forelimb configuration and head shape disparities.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Paleontology}}\n* ''[[Megalancosaurus]]''\n* ''[[Dolabrosaurus]]''\n* ''[[Hypuronector]]''\n* ''[[Vallesaurus]]''\n* [[Drepanosaur]]\n* [[Drepanosauridae]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070805153409/http://hmnh.org/galleries/monkeylizards/ Hairy Museum of Natural History page on simosaurs]\n* [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1305190?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents]\n* [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/taxa/verts/archosaurs/drepanosauromorpha.php]\n\n{{Archosauromorpha|D.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3178378}}\n\n[[Category:Drepanosaurs]]\n[[Category:Late Triassic reptiles of Europe]]\n[[Category:Late Triassic archosauromorphs]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1979]]\n", "text_old": "{{Speciesbox\n| fossil_range = [[Late Triassic]]\n| image = Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus Zogno.JPG\n| image_caption = Fossil\n| taxon = Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus\n| parent_authority = [[Giovanni Pinna|Pinna]], 1979\n| authority = Pinna, 1979\n}}\n\n'''''Drepanosaurus''''' (Dre-pan-o-sore-us) is a [[genus]] of [[arboreal]] (tree-dwelling) [[reptile]] that lived during the [[Triassic]] Period. ''Drepanosaurus'' is a genus of Drepanosauridae, a group of diapsid reptiles known for their prehensile tails. Only one adult ''Drepanosaurus'' specimen and two immature specimens have ever been found and all lacked a head and neck. ''Drepanosaurus'' was probably an insectivore, and lived in a coastal environment in what is now modern day Italy, as well as in a streamside environment in the midwestern United States.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Drepanosaurus BW.jpg|left|thumb|Restoration]]\n\nIn general, all drepanosaurs can be characterized as having long, gracile necks with a lightly built triangular skull that superficially resembles those of birds. They also have heavy bodies, with fused vertebrae up into a ridge over their shoulders. Their limbs can be described as chameleon-like with grasping hands and feet. Their long tails are tall and narrow with the possibility of containing a tail tip that has been modified into a claw.<ref>[[Feduccia, A., and R. Wild]] (1993). Birdlike characters in the Triassic archosaur ''Megalancosaurus''. ''Naturwissenschaften''. 80:564-566.</ref>\n\n''Drepanosaurus'' is known to have a huge claw on the index finger of each hand along with the tail claw. The skull of ''Drepanosaurus'' has never been found and is still unknown, however, the skulls of other drepanosaurs like ''Megalancosaurus'' give us an idea of what the skull of ''Drepanosaurus'' might look like. Looking at ''Megalancosaurus's'' skull shows that the claws of each index finger were probably the size of the entire head of ''Drepanosaurus'' and a bird like jaw and head shape.<ref>[[Matt Wedel]] (2007), ''Drepanosauromorpha'', The \"Monkey Lizards\". http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/taxa/verts/archosaurs/drepanosauromorpha.php.</ref>\n\nThe forelimb of ''Drepanosaurus'' is highly modified compared to other vertebrates and very robust. Its [[ulna]] was altered from being a forearm bone into an odd crescent shaped site for muscle attachment. The role played by the ulna in most [[tetrapod]]s is replaced by an elongated [[carpal]] bone. Additional musculature would be attached to the high [[withers]] that characterized ''Drepanosaurus'' and its close relatives.<ref>[[Harris, J.D., and A. Downs]] (2002). A drepanosaurid pectoral girdle from the Ghost Ranch (Whitaker) ''Coelophysis'' Quarry (Chinle Group, Rock Point Formation, Rhaetian), New Mexico. ''Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology''. 111:247-264.</ref>\n\n[[File:Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus tail.JPG|thumb|Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus tail]]\n\nA clue to the purpose of these large muscles can be found on its hand. The animal's \"index finger\" bore a large claw reminiscent of those born by dinosaurs such as ''[[Noasaurus]]'' and ''[[Baryonyx]]''. However it is more likely that ''Drepanosaurus'' used its claw like the modern [[pygmy anteater]], tearing through bark and insect nests to find invertebrate prey. Some researchers have forwarded the more far-fetched proposal that the claw was used to excavate burrows, but this is not unanimously agreed upon.<ref>[[Silvio Renesto]], (2003), ''Drepanosaurid (Reptilia:Diapsida) remains from a Late Triassic fissure infilling at Cromhall Quarry (Avon, Great Britain), Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 23:3, 703-705, DOI: 10.1671/A1101.</ref>\n\nThe dorsal neural spine humps of ''Drepanosaurus'' are much taller along all succeeding spines reaching down to the sacrum. Sacral and anterior caudal neural spines are very low if present at all and neural spines are elongated showing expanded dorsal margins after those areas. The scapula was robust with a 70 degree bend. The humerus and radius were short while the ulna was replaced by an ulnare and shifted to the elbow taking a disc-like form. This skeletal configuration change is thought to have been from the large claw on digit II requiring a large muscle in order to operate. The pelvis was large with the pubis forming the majority of the ventral portion. The hind limbs of ''Drepanosaurus'' were much larger than the forelimbs with the tibia and fibula being broadly separated.<ref>[[Silvio Renesto]] (1994), ''The Shoulder girdle and anterior limb of Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus (Reptilia, Neodiapsida) from the upper Triassic (Norian) of Northern Italy'', Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, Vol. 111, No. 3, pp. 247-264.</ref>\n\n==Discovery and classification==\nDiscovered in northern Italy in 1979, ''Drepanosaurus'' was named by ''Giovanni Pinna'', a Professor in Paleontology and museologist. ''Drepanosaurus'' is a rare fossil and the one adult specimen found is incomplete. Another partial specimen of ''Drepanosaurus'' was found in [[New Mexico|New Mexico's]] [[Chinle Formation]] in 2016. ''Drepanosaurus'' is part of the clade [[Drepanosauridae]], which is nested in the larger clade [[Drepanosauromorpha]]. Drepanosauromorphs are sometimes considered part of the group [[Protorosauria]] which may or may not be a natural group (i.e., monophyletic). In any case, it is clear that drepanosaurs are [[diapsid]] [[reptiles]]. The species name is ''Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus''.<ref>[[Senter, P.]] (2004). Phylogeny of Drepanosauridae. ''Journal of Systematic Palaeontology''. 2:257-268.</ref>\n\nIts name is Greek for \"sickle lizard\".\n\n==Paleobiology==\n[[File:Vallesaurus cenensis.JPG|thumb|''[[Vallesaurus]]'', a relative of ''Drepanosaurus'' with the skull preserved]]\n\n===Diet===\n''Drepanosaurus'' is hypothesized to have been an insectivore, using those large claws on the second digits to lift bark and dig into crevices and grooves on trees to find insects. It is considered that ''Drepanosaurus'' was also a digging animal and could use the tail as a tool for unearthing insects. Concerns about whether ''Drepanosaurus's'' tail was flexible enough to be used for digging are still brought up today, especially since many characteristics point to ''Drepanosaurus'' being primarily a tree-dwelling animal.\n\n==Paleoecology==\nBeing only 45 to 50&nbsp;cm in length, ''Drepanosaurus'' spent its time in trees using its gripping chameleon-like hands and feet to climb from branch to branch as well as its long tail to help wrap around branches. This hypothesized behavioral characteristic brings the notion of \"monkey-like\" to ''Drepanosaurus''. The tail also provided extra support along with the claw at the tip to help grip branches.<ref>[[Giovanni Pinna]] (1980), ''Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus'', nuovo genere e nuova specie di Lepidosauro del trias alpino. atti Soc. It. Sc.Nat. 121:181-192.</ref> ''Drepanosaurus'' would be found in wooded environments and ecosystems in what is now Northern Italy. Relatives have been found in other parts of Italy and New Mexico and New Jersey as well, in similar woodlands. ''Drepanosaurus'' is much larger than its relatives, more than double the length of ''Megalancosaurus''. All drepanosaurs are thought to be tree-dwelling insectivores with similar body structures to ''Drepanosaurus'', except for minor differences usually dealing with forelimb configuration and head shape disparities.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Paleontology}}\n* ''[[Megalancosaurus]]''\n* ''[[Dolabrosaurus]]''\n* ''[[Hypuronector]]''\n* ''[[Vallesaurus]]''\n* [[Drepanosaur]]\n* [[Drepanosauridae]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070805153409/http://hmnh.org/galleries/monkeylizards/ Hairy Museum of Natural History page on simosaurs]\n* [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1305190?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents]\n* [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/taxa/verts/archosaurs/drepanosauromorpha.php]\n\n{{Archosauromorpha|D.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3178378}}\n\n[[Category:Drepanosaurs]]\n[[Category:Late Triassic reptiles of Europe]]\n[[Category:Late Triassic archosauromorphs]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1979]]\n", "name_user": "Audrey.m.horn", "label": "safe", "comment": "updated citations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drepanosaurus"}
