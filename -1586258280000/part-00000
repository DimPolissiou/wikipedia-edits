It contained versions of the following arcade games by [[Atari]]:\n* ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]''\n* ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]''\n* ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''\n* ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]''\n* ''[[Missile Command]]''\nAlthough the games were very similar to the original games in both appearance and gameplay, they were newly written versions, not ports of the original arcade game code. Each game allowed certain customizations not available in the original arcade game, ''i.e.'' the number of lives and bonus levels. The Microsoft Help files included with the games contained history of the development of the original arcade versions of the games.\n\n== Microsoft Return of Arcade ==\nTwo follow up versions were released, including the arcade games from [[Bandai Namco]]. The first was '''''Microsoft Return of Arcade''''', released in April 1996.<ref name=launchdate>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970205042141/http://www.gamespot.com/puzzle/returnar/index.html | url=http://www.gamespot.com:80/puzzle/returnar/index.html | title=GameSpot: ''Microsoft Return of Arcade'' at a Glance | work=[[GameSpot]] | archivedate=February 5, 1997 | url-status=dead | access-date=April 3, 2020 }}</ref>\nThis compilation contains:\n* ''[[Pac-Man]]''\n* ''[[Dig Dug]]''\n* ''[[Galaxian]]''\n* ''[[Pole Position]]''\n\nIn 2000, to celebrate ''[[Pac-Man]]''{{'}}s 20th anniversary, [[Microsoft]] re-released ''Return of Arcade'' and added ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'' (as presented in ''Revenge of Arcade'') to the roster of games. None of the other games from ''Revenge of Arcade'' were included. This updated package was called '''''Microsoft Return of Arcade: Anniversary Edition'''''.\n\n== Microsoft Revenge of Arcade ==\nThe second follow-up, released in 1998, was called '''''[[Microsoft Revenge of Arcade]]''''' and contained:\n* ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''\n* ''[[Mappy]]''\n* ''[[Rally-X]]''\n* ''[[Xevious]]''\n* ''[[Motos]]''\nOfficially, both of these follow-ups required [[Windows 95]] or later, though the demo for ''Return of Arcade'' is a 16-bit program that requires only [[WinG]] to run in Windows 3.1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicdosgames.com/game/Microsoft_Return_of_Arcade.html|title=RGB Classic Games - Microsoft Return of Arcade|website=www.classicdosgames.com|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> This game will not work on 64-bit versions of Windows.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1993 stated that ''Microsoft Arcade''{{'}}s adaptation of the five games was \"nearly flawless\". It favorably cited the many hints and strategies included in [[WinHelp]] files for the games, and the [[boss key]]. The magazine liked ''Battlezone'' the most out of the five games in ''Microsoft Arcade'', but stated that \"it's been done better since\" by games like ''[[Spectre (video game)|Spectre]]''. Despite finding that the games were \"made obsolete by technology\", it predicted that ''Arcade'' would be very successful because of nostalgia, and wished that Microsoft would have updated the games with modern graphics and gameplay.<ref name=\"harris199312\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=113 | title=They Came from The Ancient Past | work=Computer Gaming World | date=December 1993 | accessdate=29 March 2016 | author=Harris, Neil | pages=180, 182}}</ref> ''Microsoft Arcade'' was named the best computer arcade game of 1993 by ''[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]]''.<ref name=\"cgm1993awards\">{{cite journal|author=Bauman, Steve|first=|date=November 2000|title=A Decade of Gaming; Award Winners of 1993|url=https://archive.org/details/ComputerGamesMag120/page/n55/mode/2up|journal=[[Computer Games Magazine]]|volume=|issue=120|pages=58|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, ''Return of Arcade'' debuted in position 16 on [[PC Data]]'s computer game sales rankings for April 1996.

a single 1.44MB floppy for both [[Microsoft Windows]] 3.1 and the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh]]. It contained versions of the following arcade games by [[Atari]]:\n* ''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]''\n* ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]''\n* ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''\n* ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]''\n* ''[[Missile Command]]''\nAlthough the games were very similar to the original games in both appearance and gameplay, they were newly written versions, not ports of the original arcade game code. Each game allowed certain customizations not available in the original arcade game, ''i.e.'' the number of lives and bonus levels. The Microsoft Help files included with the games contained history of the development of the original arcade versions of the games.\n\n== Microsoft Return of Arcade ==\nTwo follow up versions were released, including the arcade games from [[Bandai Namco]]. The first was '''''Microsoft Return of Arcade''''', released in April 1996.<ref name=launchdate>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970205042141/http://www.gamespot.com/puzzle/returnar/index.html | url=http://www.gamespot.com:80/puzzle/returnar/index.html | title=GameSpot: ''Microsoft Return of Arcade'' at a Glance | work=[[GameSpot]] | archivedate=February 5, 1997 | url-status=dead | access-date=April 3, 2020 }}</ref>\nThis compilation contains:\n* ''[[Pac-Man]]''\n* ''[[Dig Dug]]''\n* ''[[Galaxian]]''\n* ''[[Pole Position]]''\n\nIn 2000, to celebrate ''[[Pac-Man]]''{{'}}s 20th anniversary, [[Microsoft]] re-released ''Return of Arcade'' and added ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'' (as presented in ''Revenge of Arcade'') to the roster of games. None of the other games from ''Revenge of Arcade'' were included. This updated package was called '''''Microsoft Return of Arcade: Anniversary Edition'''''.\n\n== Microsoft Revenge of Arcade ==\nThe second follow-up, released in 1998, was called '''''[[Microsoft Revenge of Arcade]]''''' and contained:\n* ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''\n* ''[[Mappy]]''\n* ''[[Rally-X]]''\n* ''[[Xevious]]''\n* ''[[Motos]]''\nOfficially, both of these follow-ups required [[Windows 95]] or later, though the demo for ''Return of Arcade'' is a 16-bit program that requires only [[WinG]] to run in Windows 3.1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicdosgames.com/game/Microsoft_Return_of_Arcade.html|title=RGB Classic Games - Microsoft Return of Arcade|website=www.classicdosgames.com|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> This game will not work on 64-bit versions of Windows.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1993 stated that ''Microsoft Arcade''{{'}}s adaptation of the five games was \"nearly flawless\". It favorably cited the many hints and strategies included in [[WinHelp]] files for the games, and the [[boss key]]. The magazine liked ''Battlezone'' the most out of the five games in ''Microsoft Arcade'', but stated that \"it's been done better since\" by games like ''[[Spectre (video game)|Spectre]]''. Despite finding that the games were \"made obsolete by technology\", it predicted that ''Arcade'' would be very successful because of nostalgia, and wished that Microsoft would have updated the games with modern graphics and gameplay.<ref name=\"harris199312\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=113 | title=They Came from The Ancient Past | work=Computer Gaming World | date=December 1993 | accessdate=29 March 2016 | author=Harris, Neil | pages=180, 182}}</ref> ''Microsoft Arcade'' was named the best computer arcade game of 1993 by ''[[Computer Games Magazine|Computer Games Strategy Plus]]''.<ref name=\"cgm1993awards\">{{cite journal|author=Bauman, Steve|first=|date=November 2000|title=A Decade of Gaming; Award Winners of 1993|url=https://archive.org/details/ComputerGamesMag120/page/n55/mode/2up|journal=[[Computer Games Magazine]]|volume=|issue=120|pages=58|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, ''Return of Arcade'' debuted in position 16 on [[PC Data]]'s computer game sales rankings for April 1996.

An independent Georgia principality, Hereti, was established in times when the Arab caliphate was weak.[4] The city was also ruled by the Atabegs of Azerbaijan and the Khwarazmian Empire.\n\n===Antiquity===\nThere are traces of large-scale settlements in Shaki dating back to more than 2700 years ago. The Sakas were an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian people]] that wandered from the north side of the [[Black Sea]] through Derbend passage and to the [[South Caucasus]] and from there to [[Asia Minor]] in the 7th century B.C.  They occupied a good deal of the fertile lands in South Caucasus in an area called Sakasena. The city of Shaki was one of the areas occupied by the Sakas.

[[Shaki Khanate]] was established in 1743, during the reign of [[Nader Shah]], and was one of the strongest feudal states among the Caucasian khanates. During the existence of Shaki khanate, the local population of the city was engaged in [[silkworm|silkworm breeding]], craft and trade.<ref name=aztour /> As a result of a flood in the river Kish, the city of Shaki was partially ruined and the population was resettled in the present day city.<ref name=sharif />\n\n===Modern era===\nThe area was fully annexed by Russia by the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] in 1813 and the khanate was abolished in 1819 and the Shaki province was established in its place. Shaki province was merged with provinces of Shemakha, Baku, Susha, Lankaran, Derbent and Kuban in 1840 and Caspian Oblast was created. At the same time Shaki was renamed as Nuha. The oblast was dissolved in 1846 and it was raion center of [[Shemakha Governorate]]. After the earthquake in Shemakha in 1859, the governorate was renamed as [[Baku Governorate]]. On 19 February 1868, raion of Nuha was passed to newly created [[Yelizavetpol Governorate]] with one of Susha. After founding of USSR, it was the center of Nuha raion. Its one was abolished on 4 January 1963 and was bounded to one of [[Oghuz (city)|Vartashen]]. Nuha one was founded again in 1965 and finally, city and raion regained traditional name in 1968.\n\nDuring its history, the town saw devastation many times and because of that, the oldest historic and architectural monuments currently preserved are dated to only the 16th\u201319th centuries. For many centuries, Shaki has been famous for being the center of silkworm-breeding. Originally located on the left bank of the river Kish, the town sat lower down the hill, however Shaki was moved to its present location after a devastating flood in 1772 and became the capital of [[Shaki Khanate]]. As the new location was near the village of Nukha, the city also became known as Nukha, until 1968 when it reverted to the name Shaki.<ref>[http://sheki-ih.gov.az/news.php?cat.21 \u015e\u0259ki \u015e\u0259h\u0259rinin Tarixi] {{in lang|az}}</ref>\n\n===Republic era===\n\nA letter from the Chairman of the [[Kyoto]] City Council, [[Daisaku Kadokawa]], on 8 December 2008, said that Sheki was a member of the World Historical Cities League.

The oblast was dissolved in 1846 and it was raion center of [[Shemakha Governorate]]. After the earthquake in Shemakha in 1859, the governorate was renamed as [[Baku Governorate]]. On 19 February 1868, raion of Nuha was passed to newly created [[Yelizavetpol Governorate]] with one of Susha. After founding of USSR, it was center of Nuha raion. Its one was abolished on 4 January 1963 and was bounded to one of [[Oghuz (city)|Vartashen]]. Nuha one was founded again in 1965 and finally city and raion regained traditional name in 1968.\n\nDuring its history, the town saw devastation many times and because of that, the oldest historic and architectural monuments currently preserved are dated to only the 16th\u201319th centuries. For many centuries, Shaki has been famous for being the center of silkworm-breeding. Originally located on the left bank of the river Kish, the town sat lower down the hill, however Shaki was moved to its present location after a devastating flood in 1772 and became the capital of [[Shaki Khanate]]. As the new location was near the village of Nukha, the city also became known as Nukha, until 1968 when it reverted to the name Shaki.<ref>[http://sheki-ih.gov.az/news.php?cat.21 \u015e\u0259ki \u015e\u0259h\u0259rinin Tarixi] {{in lang|az}}</ref>\n\n===Republic era===\n\nA letter from the Chairman of the [[Kyoto]] City Council, [[Daisaku Kadokawa]], on 8 December 2008, said that Sheki was a member of the World Historical Cities League.
