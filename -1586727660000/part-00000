Outlook Media also published ''High Street Neighborhoods'', managed Columbus' LGBT and allied business networking group, Network Columbus, and partnered with the [[Ohio Historical Society]] to form the Gay Ohio History Initiative.  In 2015, Outlook Media began to publish The Love Big LGBT Wedding Expo Guide, and began holding Love Big LGBT Wedding Expos throughout [[Ohio]].\n\n==Publications and Community Initiatives==\n===Outlook Columbus===\n''[[Outlook Columbus]]'' was a monthly, glossy lifestyle and advocacy magazine geared toward Ohio's LGBT and [[urban area|urban]] progressive communities.

''Outlook Columbus'' differentiates itself from similar LGBT publications by its advertising.

Cox and Jim Ryan in the spring of 1995 with the primary purpose of publishing their paper titled ''Outlook''. Ryan was editor and managed distribution while Cox managed finances, layout, and design from his home. The paper relied on volunteer initiative and freelance reporters to operate. Before ''Outlook'''s establishment, the only other GLBT focused publications in Ohio were the ''[[Gay People's Chronicle]]'', which was based out of [[Cleveland]], and a monthly publication from [[Stonewall Columbus]]. ''Outlook'' was created to fill the void as a news voice for the Columbus community.\n\nUnder Cox, and Ryan's ownership, the newspaper quickly became respected as a professional news source. In the fall of 1998, ''Outlook'' earned five writing awards, called the [[Vice Versa (magazine)|Vice Versa Awards for Excellence]] in the Gay and Lesbian Press, from the [[National Gay and Lesbian Journalists Association]] and received third place for Best Newspaper in the weekly or bi-weekly category. These awards were given for the paper's approach to controversial topics and the effect they had on the Columbus community. For example, when ''Outlook'' published a piece about anti-gay harassment by members of the [[Ohio State University]] wrestling team, the OSU Athletic Department created mandatory sexual orientation cultural competence training for all its employees.\n\nIn early 1999, Outlook Publishing, Inc. was sold to Lynn Greer, Jose Rodriguez, and Malcolm Riggle operating from Riggle's offices in [[Worthington, Ohio]]. Within the year Rodriguez sold his share of the company to Greer and Riggle.\n\nIn the fall of 2003, Malcom Riggle assumed sole-ownership of company operations. Under his leadership, ''Outlook Weekly'' became a lifestyle tabloid. That November, Outlook Publishing, Inc. changed names to Outlook Media, Inc. Two years later, in the fall of 2005, Outlook teamed with the [[Ohio Historical Society]] to form the ''Gay Ohio History Initiative''.<ref>Williams, Sherri. 10-17-05.

Although born in [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]] Jones spent his early life growing up in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]]. From early on, Jones developed both an artistic interest in drawing and the physical act of building. Jones\u2019 interest in physical design continued to grow during highschool grade 11 when he was enrolled in a class that taught drafting.<ref name=\":1\" /> This eventually drove him to pursue post secondary to achieve both a bachelors and a masters degree. In 1995, Jones received a bachelor's degree in Environmental Design at the [[University of Manitoba]] followed by a bachelor of Environmental Design Studies at the [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]] (TUNS)(which merged into what is now [[Dalhousie University]]) in 1997.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Shortly after, he returned back to the University of Manitoba where he completed his masters in Architecture in 1999.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nDuring his time still as an undergrad student in university, Jones was already designing architecture that made its way into physical realization. His first real project was a commission done in 1996 by his own parents asking him to design their home.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://archinect.com/features/article/150068361/vancouver-based-d-arcy-jones-architecture-stays-small-to-maintain-intimacy-with-their-work|title=Vancouver Based D'Arcy Jones Architecture Stays Small to Maintain Intimacy With Their Work|website=Archinect|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref> During this time, Jones claims that the project made him appreciate and \u201cfall in love\u201d with factors that were not taught in architecture school, such as the practical and technical characteristics of architecture.<ref name=\":5\" /> The success of this solo project caused him to find his own practice after graduating from masters in 1999, where he would officially start practicing alone from the years 2000-2005.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> During these early times as a solo practice, Jones was based out of his personal house located in Vancouver\u2019s west end.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nProfessionally, Jones followed a path that was considered abnormal and non-traditional. As typically seen in Canada (where he would eventually practice) and many other parts of the world, the licensing process remains very strict and orderly in terms of how to achieve official registration as a practicing architect. With respect to contemporary licensing, the process follows a structure where an individual with a Masters of Architecture degree will work under the title of \u2018[[Intern architect|intern]]\u2019 through already established firms. Instead, Jones founded his own practice,\u00a0right after graduating in 1999 and has been self-employed ever since.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Unlike in a normal intern employment situation where a registered architect will supervise and sign off on one\u2019s \u2018working hours,\u2019 Jones never traditionally interned and obtained his hours remaining as a solo practice by collaborations and joint ventures. He states in an interview that he used joint ventures with registered architects as a means to carry out projects and complete his \u2018internship.\u2019<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAfter 5 years of solo practice, Jones moved the practice from his own home into an office space in Mount Pleasant in 2005.<ref name=\":1\" /> From here Jones officially founded D\u2019Arcy Jones Architecture (currently known as D\u2019Arcy Jones Architects) where he expanded his studio size to a humble 9 person team including himself.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Although technically involved with architectural practice since the conception of his firm in 2000, Jones achieved being a registered architect in 2013.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs an established architect and practice, Jones actively involves himself and contributes within the field of architecture through talk panels, design competitions, lecturing, juries, and teaching. In 2015, Jones was taken on by the University of British Columbia to be an adjunct professor within their schools of Architecture and Landscape Architecture where things like studio teaching, critiquing and being a thesis advisor are carried out.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Most recently, he was invited by the [[University of Calgary]] as a guest critic for students\u2019 within the Faculty of Environmental Design.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n== Design Approach ==\nD\u2019Arcy Jones has always been recognized for his boutique residential houses ever since completing his very first project as a student. To this day, Jones has gained respect through his most notable works and completed projects which fall largely under the typology of single residential housing.<ref name=\":6\" /> Alongside the natural evolution of the firm, projects encompassing a broader typology but keeping in similar scale include galleries, renovations, interiors, commercial and gallery spaces.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nJones\u2019 projects focus greatly on the exploration and combination of program together with proportion, and how site and materiality shape it. Furthermore, these aspects help DJA explore the technicalities of details and construction as integral parts of the design process.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nJones has always been a proponent of the deeper characteristics of sustainability and inherently is seen translated into DJA\u2019s project designs and philosophies.<ref name=\":5\" /> As seen through Vancouver's First Shaughnessy Design Panel, Jones was actively involved representing the [[Architectural Institute of British Columbia]] ([[Architectural Institute of British Columbia|AIBC]]). This was a panel that fundamentally helped establish Vancouver\u2019s prohibition against demolishing heritage houses that dated before the 1940\u2019s.<ref name=\":0\" /> From a design perspective, DJA\u2019s philosophy encourages the integration of modern expression by using existing buildings as a starting point or blank canvas.<ref name=\":1\" /> In many of DJA\u2019s projects, intensive renovations and adaptive reuse of existing homes seems to be where opportunities in showcasing sustainability take place through innovation and thoughtful recycling.<ref name=\":2\" /> As stated by Jones, \"the greenest building is the one already built,\" and this further encourages their projects to address material efficiently and re imagine innovative sustainable designs to introduce things like passive cooling and breezes to save energy.<ref name=\":5\" /> Through their designs, Jones\u2019 also encourages design sustainability through key factors like favoring common and local building materials over nonnative and foreign ones.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> This ultimately challenges Jones to push the possibilities and innovations of such conventional materials and construction practices.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAdding to DJA\u2019s design philosophy, they are well recognized for their feasibility in both economics and physical craftsmanship. DJA prides itself on delivering high quality design that challenge but also push traditional methods of construction.<ref name=\":5\" /> Ever since Jones\u2019 first project, he developed an appreciation for physical craftsmanship and construction that he further encourages and promotes through his own designs.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> This is done through the practice\u2019s intricate detail design work together with the strong realization of construction realities.<ref name=\":5\" /> Together with strong relationships with local builders and labourers, the bespoke design work is still intended to be able to be carried out by the majority of construction workers.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nIn response to the scale and level of detailed work produced by DJA, it has always been an intensive studio culture where everyone ranging from interns to seniors are all in charge of leading 2-3 projects each. Jones believes this allows projects and workers to have a better rounded perspective rather than more traditional hierarchies seen in other firms.<ref name=\":1\" /> Starting at a 9 person office, Jones\u2019 states that he does not intend to surpass 15 people as the focus and intimacy of project details and design will be lost which goes against his practice\u2019s philosophy.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Jones' personal design influences consist of a wide, ever-changing variety of architects but states that despite the immediate rotation, \"I often come back to earlier influences.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://graymag.com/2019/05/13/architect-darcy-jones-chooses-paths-less-traveled/|title=Architect D\u2019Arcy Jones Chooses Paths Less Traveled|last=May 13|first=Kathrine Guzik|last2=2019|date=2019-05-13|website=GRAY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\n== Notable Projects ==\n'''Friesen Wong House'''\n\nThe Friesen Wong House is a custom single family residential house that additionally features a pottery studio and shop area.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.darcyjones.com/friesen-wong-house|title=Friesen Wong House|website=D'Arcy Jones Architects|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The siting of the house takes place on a rocky hilltop that overlooks the topography of the surrounding [[Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park and Protected Area|Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park]].<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> The house was designed bespoke to cater towards the lifestyle of the owners Jon Friesen and Silping Wong.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dwell.com/home/friesen-wong-residence-d2020448|title=Friesen-Wong Residence Modern Home in British Columbia, Canada by\u2026|website=Dwell|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> This meant a design integrated within nature that responded to their lifestyle surrounding heavily on outdoor activities.<ref name=\":11\" /> Jon states that the was imagined to be an \"extension of the park\" where the house grew out of the land rather than being an object building that disrupted the landscape. Jon also states that the house was imagined to embody the surrounding park despite where you were located within the house, as if always \"walking around the park.\"<ref name=\":11\" /> Jones ultimately responds to this design vision by translating the house into a sturdy and tough built form to respond to the site but also gracefully being sited within the landscape.<ref name=\":11\" /> The house focuses an emphasis on innovative sustainable and economic features. A prominent concrete cantilever structure together with structural insulated panel building technology (SIPS) was designed to work in tandem with small steel pins to help support the floor slab and ultimately create a thermal break to ensure a continuous insulation layer.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Other structural innovations include a concrete block column that was used hollowed out to render a fireplace on the interior.<ref name=\":11\" /> On the interior, \"saddlebag\" storage units increase temperature control and have allowed cutback on glazing costs.<ref name=\":11\" /> For materiality, the house chooses to showcase its permanence with materials like steel, concrete, and charred wood that require little upkeep.<ref name=\":11\" /> The cladding was done in a Douglas Fir wood that is native to the region. Together with his father, Jon personally charred the wood using a technique called traditional Japanese wood preserving technique called [[Yakisugi|shou sugi ban]] to protect against weathering and insect erosion.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe Frieson Wong House went on to win a handful of awards, most notably the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia Awards in Architecture (2017).<ref name=\":10\" /> \n\n\n\n'''Double Header House'''\n\nThe Double Header House is single residential housing project designed to house 3 generations of one family under one roof. The house is split into two main units: one housing the main family and kids, and the other housing the grandparents, and public and private access to both units through a communal staircase.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/darcy-jones-creates-a-multi-gen-marvel-in-victoria-b-c/|title=D'Arcy Jones Creates a Multi-Gen Marvel in Victoria, B.C.|date=2019-11-25|website=Azure Magazine|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> This unique living condition was determined by the local zoning in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria BC]] that prevented the development of a duplex on the site, but instead allowed for a main building accompanied with a secondary suite.<ref name=\":12\" /> The plan layout consists of both living suits to be be facing each other in a north-south orientation rather than a typical side-by-side layout seen in duplexes. This would allow both spaces to feel a sense of width close to a \"typical house\".<ref name=\":12\" /> What is most unique about the house is the origami like metal overhangs identical on both facades. This important design element helps mitigate sunlight coming into the house but still provides enough light into the interior. This overhang also helps with the privacy of people looking in.<ref name=\":12\" />\n \n\n\n'''Deep Cove House'''\n\nThe Deep Cove House is single residential house located in [[Deep Cove, North Vancouver]]. As Jones describes, the house was designed to be \"part look-out tower, part courtyard and part land form.\" <ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2019/11/07/deep-cove-house-darcy-jones-architects-vancouver/|title=D'Arcy Jones defines Deep Cove House with slanted wood-clad walls|date=2019-11-07|website=Dezeen|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://alumni.dal.ca/news/deep-cove-house-by-darcy-jones-beds-97-architects-selected-as-one-of-dezeens-top-10-canadian-houses-of-2019/|title=D'Arcy Jones (BEDS'97) Architects takes 2019 top magazine honours!|date=2019-12-17|website=Dalhousie Alumni|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.darcyjones.com/deep-cove-house|title=Deep Cove House|website=D'Arcy Jones Architects|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> The house is sited on top a clifftop in Deep Cove where ultimately this multi-functioning form and program came to realization. The exterior of the house is designed with contrasting facades: the public street-facing one being completely closed off with no glazing versus the backside with extensive wrap-around windows.<ref name=\":13\" /> This is to allow for minimal views into the house from the public and nearby commercial streets and maximizes the expansive views overlooking the surrounding forest and water.<ref name=\":13\" /> The building's sharp angles also help combat and minimize exterior glare and promote water runoff.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":14\" />. The interior was designed around a minimalist and modest yet flexible plan.<ref name=\":13\" /> This meant a simple grey-scale colour palette with minimalistic furniture. This was designed with inspiration from older architectural ideals of creating rooms with no given program and instead allow a multitude of programs/uses to form to a generic room.<ref name=\":13\" /> This would ultimately allow for the exterior views to be the highlight rather than interior.<ref name=\":13\" /> \n\nThe Deep Cove House was selected in 2019 as one of [[Dezeen]]'s Top 10 Canadian Houses.<ref name=\":14\" />\n== Awards and Achievements ==\nD\u2019arcy Jones Architects has been the recipient of many awards and achievements.

Although born in [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]] Jones spent his early life growing up in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]]. From early on, Jones developed both an artistic interest in drawing and the physical act of building. Jones\u2019 interest in physical design continued to grow during highschool grade 11 when he was enrolled in a class that taught drafting.<ref name=\":1\" /> This eventually drove him to pursue post secondary to achieve both a bachelors and a masters degree. In 1995, Jones received a bachelor's degree in Environmental Design at the [[University of Manitoba]] followed by a bachelor of Environmental Design Studies at the [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]] (TUNS)(which merged into what is now [[Dalhousie University]]). Shortly after, he returned back to the University of Manitoba where he completed his masters in Architecture in 1999.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nDuring his time still as an undergrad student in university, Jones was already designing architecture that made its way into physical realization. His first real project was a commission done in 1996 by his own parents asking him to design their home.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://archinect.com/features/article/150068361/vancouver-based-d-arcy-jones-architecture-stays-small-to-maintain-intimacy-with-their-work|title=Vancouver Based D'Arcy Jones Architecture Stays Small to Maintain Intimacy With Their Work|website=Archinect|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref> During this time, Jones claims that the project made him appreciate and \u201cfall in love\u201d with factors that were not taught in architecture school, such as the practical and technical characteristics of architecture.<ref name=\":5\" /> The success of this solo project caused him to find his own practice after graduating from masters in 1999, where he would officially start practicing alone from the years 2000-2005.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> During these early times as a solo practice, Jones was based out of his personal house located in Vancouver\u2019s west end.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nProfessionally, Jones followed a path that was considered abnormal and non-traditional. As typically seen in Canada (where he would eventually practice) and many other parts of the world, the licensing process remains very strict and orderly in terms of how to achieve official registration as a practicing architect. With respect to contemporary licensing, the process follows a structure where an individual with a Masters of Architecture degree will work under the title of \u2018[[Intern architect|intern]]\u2019 through already established firms. Instead, Jones founded his own practice,\u00a0right after graduating in 1999 and has been self-employed ever since.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> Unlike in a normal intern employment situation where a registered architect will supervise and sign off on one\u2019s \u2018working hours,\u2019 Jones never traditionally interned and obtained his hours remaining as a solo practice by collaborations and joint ventures. He states in an interview that he used joint ventures with registered architects as a means to carry out projects and complete his \u2018internship.\u2019<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAfter 5 years of solo practice, Jones moved the practice from his own home into an office space in Mount Pleasant in 2005.<ref name=\":1\" /> From here Jones officially founded D\u2019Arcy Jones Architecture (currently known as D\u2019Arcy Jones Architects) where he expanded his studio size to a humble 9 person team including himself.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Although technically involved with architectural practice since the conception of his firm in 2000, Jones achieved being a registered architect in 2013.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs an established architect and practice, Jones actively involves himself and contributes within the field of architecture through talk panels, design competitions, lecturing, juries, and teaching. In 2015, Jones was taken on by the University of British Columbia to be an adjunct professor within their schools of Architecture and Landscape Architecture where things like studio teaching, critiquing and being a thesis advisor are carried out.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> Most recently, he was invited by the [[University of Calgary]] as a guest critic for students\u2019 within the Faculty of Environmental Design.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n== Design Approach ==\nD\u2019Arcy Jones has always been recognized for his boutique residential houses ever since completing his very first project as a student. To this day, Jones has gained respect through his most notable works and completed projects which fall largely under the typology of single residential housing.<ref name=\":6\" /> Alongside the natural evolution of the firm, projects encompassing a broader typology but keeping in similar scale include galleries, renovations, interiors, commercial and gallery spaces.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nJones\u2019 projects focus greatly on the exploration and combination of program together with proportion, and how site and materiality shape it. Furthermore, these aspects help DJA explore the technicalities of details and construction as integral parts of the design process.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nJones has always been a proponent of the deeper characteristics of sustainability and inherently is seen translated into DJA\u2019s project designs and philosophies.<ref name=\":5\" /> As seen through Vancouver's First Shaughnessy Design Panel, Jones was actively involved representing the [[Architectural Institute of British Columbia]] ([[Architectural Institute of British Columbia|AIBC]]). This was a panel that fundamentally helped establish Vancouver\u2019s prohibition against demolishing heritage houses that dated before the 1940\u2019s.<ref name=\":0\" /> From a design perspective, DJA\u2019s philosophy encourages the integration of modern expression by using existing buildings as a starting point or blank canvas.<ref name=\":1\" /> In many of DJA\u2019s projects, intensive renovations and adaptive reuse of existing homes seems to be where opportunities in showcasing sustainability take place through innovation and thoughtful recycling.<ref name=\":2\" /> As stated by Jones, \"the greenest building is the one already built,\" and this further encourages their projects to address material efficiently and re imagine innovative sustainable designs to introduce things like passive cooling and breezes to save energy.<ref name=\":5\" /> Through their designs, Jones\u2019 also encourages design sustainability through key factors like favoring common and local building materials over nonnative and foreign ones.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> This ultimately challenges Jones to push the possibilities and innovations of such conventional materials and construction practices.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAdding to DJA\u2019s design philosophy, they are well recognized for their feasibility in both economics and physical craftsmanship. DJA prides itself on delivering high quality design that challenge but also push traditional methods of construction.<ref name=\":5\" /> Ever since Jones\u2019 first project, he developed an appreciation for physical craftsmanship and construction that he further encourages and promotes through his own designs.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> This is done through the practice\u2019s intricate detail design work together with the strong realization of construction realities.<ref name=\":5\" /> Together with strong relationships with local builders and labourers, the bespoke design work is still intended to be able to be carried out by the majority of construction workers.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nIn response to the scale and level of detailed work produced by DJA, it has always been an intensive studio culture where everyone ranging from interns to seniors are all in charge of leading 2-3 projects each. Jones believes this allows projects and workers to have a better rounded perspective rather than more traditional hierarchies seen in other firms.<ref name=\":1\" /> Starting at a 9 person office, Jones\u2019 states that he does not intend to surpass 15 people as the focus and intimacy of project details and design will be lost which goes against his practice\u2019s philosophy.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Jones' personal design influences consist of a wide, ever-changing variety of architects but states that despite the immediate rotation, \"I often come back to earlier influences.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://graymag.com/2019/05/13/architect-darcy-jones-chooses-paths-less-traveled/|title=Architect D\u2019Arcy Jones Chooses Paths Less Traveled|last=May 13|first=Kathrine Guzik|last2=2019|date=2019-05-13|website=GRAY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\n== Notable Projects ==\n'''Friesen Wong House'''\n\nThe Friesen Wong House is a custom single family residential house that additionally features a pottery studio and shop area.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.darcyjones.com/friesen-wong-house|title=Friesen Wong House|website=D'Arcy Jones Architects|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The siting of the house takes place on a rocky hilltop that overlooks the topography of the surrounding [[Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park and Protected Area|Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park]].<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /> The house was designed bespoke to cater towards the lifestyle of the owners Jon Friesen and Silping Wong.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dwell.com/home/friesen-wong-residence-d2020448|title=Friesen-Wong Residence Modern Home in British Columbia, Canada by\u2026|website=Dwell|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> This meant a design integrated within nature that responded to their lifestyle surrounding heavily on outdoor activities.<ref name=\":11\" /> Jon states that the was imagined to be an \"extension of the park\" where the house grew out of the land rather than being an object building that disrupted the landscape. Jon also states that the house was imagined to embody the surrounding park despite where you were located within the house, as if always \"walking around the park.\"<ref name=\":11\" /> Jones ultimately responds to this design vision by translating the house into a sturdy and tough built form to respond to the site but also gracefully being sited within the landscape.<ref name=\":11\" /> The house focuses an emphasis on innovative sustainable and economic features. A prominent concrete cantilever structure together with structural insulated panel building technology (SIPS) was designed to work in tandem with small steel pins to help support the floor slab and ultimately create a thermal break to ensure a continuous insulation layer.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Other structural innovations include a concrete block column that was used hollowed out to render a fireplace on the interior.<ref name=\":11\" /> On the interior, \"saddlebag\" storage units increase temperature control and have allowed cutback on glazing costs.<ref name=\":11\" /> For materiality, the house chooses to showcase its permanence with materials like steel, concrete, and charred wood that require little upkeep.<ref name=\":11\" /> The cladding was done in a Douglas Fir wood that is native to the region. Together with his father, Jon personally charred the wood using a technique called traditional Japanese wood preserving technique called [[Yakisugi|shou sugi ban]] to protect against weathering and insect erosion.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe Frieson Wong House went on to win a handful of awards, most notably the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia Awards in Architecture (2017).<ref name=\":10\" /> \n\n\n\n'''Double Header House'''\n\nThe Double Header House is single residential housing project designed to house 3 generations of one family under one roof. The house is split into two main units: one housing the main family and kids, and the other housing the grandparents, and public and private access to both units through a communal staircase.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.azuremagazine.com/article/darcy-jones-creates-a-multi-gen-marvel-in-victoria-b-c/|title=D'Arcy Jones Creates a Multi-Gen Marvel in Victoria, B.C.|date=2019-11-25|website=Azure Magazine|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> This unique living condition was determined by the local zoning in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria BC]] that prevented the development of a duplex on the site, but instead allowed for a main building accompanied with a secondary suite.<ref name=\":12\" /> The plan layout consists of both living suits to be be facing each other in a north-south orientation rather than a typical side-by-side layout seen in duplexes. This would allow both spaces to feel a sense of width close to a \"typical house\".<ref name=\":12\" /> What is most unique about the house is the origami like metal overhangs identical on both facades. This important design element helps mitigate sunlight coming into the house but still provides enough light into the interior. This overhang also helps with the privacy of people looking in.<ref name=\":12\" />\n \n\n\n'''Deep Cove House'''\n\nThe Deep Cove House is single residential house located in [[Deep Cove, North Vancouver]]. As Jones describes, the house was designed to be \"part look-out tower, part courtyard and part land form.\" <ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2019/11/07/deep-cove-house-darcy-jones-architects-vancouver/|title=D'Arcy Jones defines Deep Cove House with slanted wood-clad walls|date=2019-11-07|website=Dezeen|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://alumni.dal.ca/news/deep-cove-house-by-darcy-jones-beds-97-architects-selected-as-one-of-dezeens-top-10-canadian-houses-of-2019/|title=D'Arcy Jones (BEDS'97) Architects takes 2019 top magazine honours!|date=2019-12-17|website=Dalhousie Alumni|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.darcyjones.com/deep-cove-house|title=Deep Cove House|website=D'Arcy Jones Architects|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> The house is sited on top a clifftop in Deep Cove where ultimately this multi-functioning form and program came to realization. The exterior of the house is designed with contrasting facades: the public street-facing one being completely closed off with no glazing versus the backside with extensive wrap-around windows.<ref name=\":13\" /> This is to allow for minimal views into the house from the public and nearby commercial streets and maximizes the expansive views overlooking the surrounding forest and water.<ref name=\":13\" /> The building's sharp angles also help combat and minimize exterior glare and promote water runoff.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":14\" />. The interior was designed around a minimalist and modest yet flexible plan.<ref name=\":13\" /> This meant a simple grey-scale colour palette with minimalistic furniture. This was designed with inspiration from older architectural ideals of creating rooms with no given program and instead allow a multitude of programs/uses to form to a generic room.<ref name=\":13\" /> This would ultimately allow for the exterior views to be the highlight rather than interior.<ref name=\":13\" /> \n\nThe Deep Cove House was selected in 2019 as one of [[Dezeen]]'s Top 10 Canadian Houses.<ref name=\":14\" />\n== Awards and Achievements ==\nD\u2019arcy Jones Architects has been the recipient of many awards and achievements.

Named for [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States|U.S. president]], the state was made out of the western part of the [[Washington Territory]], which was ceded by the [[British Empire]] in 1846, in accordance with the [[Oregon Treaty]] in the settlement of the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. The state, which is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Oregon]] to the south, [[Idaho]] to the east, and the [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] to the north, was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] is the [[state capital]]; the state's largest city is [[Seattle]]. Washington is often referred to as '''Washington State''' to distinguish it from the nation's capital, [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\nWashington is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|18th largest state]], with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 km<sup>2</sup>), and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|13th most populous]] state, with more than 7.6 million people. Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], the center of transportation, business, and industry along [[Puget Sound]], an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep [[fjord]]s, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep [[temperate rainforest]]s in the west; [[mountain range]]s in the west, central, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Western United States]], after [[California]]. [[Mount Rainier]], an active [[stratovolcano]], is the state's highest elevation, at almost {{convert|14411|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, and is the most [[topographically prominent]] mountain in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous U.S.]]\n\nWashington is a leading lumber producer; its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. Washington is the nation's largest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes.

A [[Mediterranean Climate]] predominates in western Washington, and a much drier [[semi-arid climate]] prevails east of the Cascade Range. Major factors determining Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] and [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]] systems of the north Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade mountains. In the spring and summer, a high pressure [[anticyclone]] system dominates the north Pacific Ocean, causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion. For Washington, this means [[prevailing winds]] from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably [[dry season]].\n\nIn the autumn and winter, a low-pressure [[cyclone]] system takes over in the north Pacific Ocean. The air spiraling inward in a counter-clockwise fashion causes Washington's prevailing winds to come from the southwest, and bring relatively warm and moist air masses and a predictably [[wet season]]. The term \"[[Pineapple Express]]\" is used colloquially to describe [[atmospheric river]] events, where repeated storm systems are directed by this persistent cyclone from tropical and near-tropical Pacific regions into the Pacific Northwest.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kruckeberg | first = Arthur R. | title = The Natural History of Puget Sound Country | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1991 | pages = 42\u201343 | isbn = 978-0-295-97477-4}}</ref>\n\nDespite western Washington's having a marine climate similar to many coastal cities of Europe, there are exceptions such as the \"Big Snow\" events of 1880, 1881, 1893, and 1916, and the \"deep freeze\" winters of 1883\u20131884, 1915\u20131916, 1949\u20131950, and 1955\u20131956, among others.

The Olympic Peninsula's western side receives as much as {{convert|160|in}} of precipitation annually, making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a [[temperate rainforest]]. Weeks may pass without a clear day. The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall (in some places more than {{convert|200|in|disp=or|sp=us}} water equivalent) in the country. In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only {{convert|6|in}}. Precipitation then increases again eastward toward the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe Olympic mountains and Cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing [[orographic lift]] of the air masses blown inland from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels. This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range. In both cases the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild, cool temperatures. While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher elevations. [[Mount Baker]], near the state's northern border, is one of the snowiest places in the world.

Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central [[Columbia Plateau]]\u2014especially the region just east of the Columbia River from about the Snake River to the [[Okanagan Highland]]. Thus, instead of rain forests, much of eastern Washington is covered with [[grassland]] and [[shrub-steppe]].\n\n====Temperatures====\n\nThe average annual temperature ranges from {{convert|51|F}} on the Pacific coast to {{convert|40|F}} in the northeast. The lowest temperature recorded in the state was {{convert|-48|F}} in [[Winthrop, Washington|Winthrop]] and [[Mazama, Washington|Mazama]].

He claimed the coastal lands up to [[Prince William Sound]] for Spain as part of their claimed rights under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which they maintained made the Pacific a \"Spanish lake\" and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire.\n\nIn 1778, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] explorer Captain [[James Cook]] sighted [[Cape Flattery]], at the entrance to the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], but Cook did not realize the strait existed. It was not discovered until [[Charles William Barkley]], captain of the ''[[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]]'', sighted it in 1787. The straits were further explored by [[Spain|Spanish explorers]] [[Manuel Quimper]] in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791, and British explorer [[George Vancouver]] in 1792.\n\n===Settlement===\n\n{{Main|Oregon pioneer history}}\n\nThe British-Spanish [[Nootka Convention]] of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States. American captain [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]] (for whom [[Grays Harbor County, Washington|Grays Harbor County]] is named) then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River. He named the river after his ship, the [[Columbia Rediviva|''Columbia'']]. Beginning in 1792, Gray established trade in [[sea otter]] pelts. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] entered the state on October 10, 1805.\n\nExplorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], on his voyage down the Columbia River, camped at the confluence with the Snake River on July 9, 1811, and erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the [[North West Company]] to build a trading post at the site.\n[[File:Fort Nez Perces Trading 1841.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Fur trading at [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s]] in 1841]]\n\nBritain and the United States agreed to what has since been described as \"joint occupancy\" of lands west of the [[Continental Divide]] to the Pacific Ocean as part of the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], which established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary west from [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues, west to the Pacific, was deferred until a later time. Spain, in 1819, ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States, although these rights did not include possession.\n\nNegotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was highly contested between Britain and the United States. Disputed joint-occupancy by Britain and the U.S. lasted for several decades. With American settlers pouring into [[Oregon Country]], [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the [[Columbia District]].\n\nFur trapper [[James Sinclair (fur trader)|James Sinclair]], on orders from [[George Simpson (administrator)|Sir George Simpson]], Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, led some 200 settlers from the [[Red River Colony]] west in 1841 to settle on Hudson Bay Company farms near [[Fort Vancouver]]. The party crossed the Rockies into the [[Columbia Valley]], near present-day [[Radium Hot Springs]], British Columbia, then traveled south-west down the [[Kootenai River]] and Columbia River. Despite such efforts, Britain eventually ceded all claims to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States in the [[Oregon Treaty]] on June 15, 1846.\n\nIn 1836, a group of missionaries, including [[Marcus Whitman]], established several missions and Whitman's own settlement Waiilatpu, in what is now southeastern Washington state, near present day [[Walla Walla County, Washington|Walla Walla County]], in territory of both the [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] and the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] Indian tribes. Whitman's settlement would in 1843 help the [[Oregon Trail]], the overland emigration route to the west, get established for thousands of emigrants in the following decades. Marcus provided medical care for the Native Americans, but when Indian patients\u2014lacking immunity to new, \"European\" diseases\u2014died in striking numbers, while at the same time many white patients recovered, they held \"medicine man\" Marcus Whitman personally responsible, and murdered Whitman and twelve other white settlers in the [[Whitman massacre]] in 1847. This event triggered the [[Cayuse War]] between settlers and Indians.\n\n[[Fort Nisqually]], a farm and trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company and the first European settlement in the [[Puget Sound]] area, was founded in 1833. Black pioneer [[George Washington Bush]] and his Caucasian wife, Isabella James Bush, from [[Missouri]] and [[Tennessee]], respectively, led four white families into the territory and founded New Market, now [[Tumwater, Washington|Tumwater]], in 1846. They settled in Washington to avoid Oregon's discriminatory settlement laws.<ref>{{cite web | title = Articles on George Washington Bush | publisher = City of Tumwater, WA | url = http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm | accessdate = June 15, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070714212032/http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm\n| archivedate = July 14, 2007 }}</ref> After them, many more settlers, migrating overland along the Oregon Trail, wandered north to settle in the Puget Sound area.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{Main|Oregon boundary dispute|Provisional Government of Oregon|Oregon Treaty|Oregon Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Washington Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Seattle - looking east on Yesler Way, 1887.jpg|thumb|Seattle in 1887]]\n\nThe growing populace of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory.

In eastern Washington, the [[Yakima River]] Valley became known for its apple orchards, while the growth of wheat using [[Dryland farming|dry farming]] techniques became particularly productive. Heavy rainfall to the west of the Cascade Range produced dense forests, and the ports along Puget Sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products, particularly the [[Douglas fir]]. Other industries that developed in the state included fishing, salmon canning and mining.\n\n===Industrial era===\n\n[[File:B-17Es at Boeing Plant, Seattle, Washington, 1943.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]] bombers under construction, circa{{nbsp}}1942]]\n\nFor a long period, [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] had large smelters where gold, silver, copper, and lead ores were treated. [[Seattle]] was the primary port for trade with Alaska and the rest of the country, and for a time, it possessed a large shipbuilding industry. The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and the [[Boeing]] company became an established icon in the area.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], a series of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]] were constructed along the Columbia river as part of a project to increase the production of electricity. This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], the largest concrete structure in the United States.\n\nDuring World War II, the state became a focus for war industries. While the Boeing Company produced many of the nation's [[heavy bomber]]s, ports in Seattle, [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], and Tacoma were available for the manufacture of warships. Seattle was the point of departure for many soldiers in the Pacific, a number of whom were quartered at [[Golden Gardens Park]]. In eastern Washington, the [[Hanford Site|Hanford Works]] [[Nuclear power|atomic energy]] plant was opened in 1943, and played a major role in the construction of the nation's [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bombs]].\n\n===Mount St. Helens eruption, 1980===\n\n{{Main|1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens}}\n\nOn May 18, 1980, following a period of heavy tremors and eruptions, the northeast face of [[Mount St. Helens]] [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|erupted violently]], destroying a large part of the top of the volcano.

The North Cascades Highway, [[Washington State Route 20|State Route 20]], closes every year due to snowfall and avalanches in the area of [[Washington Pass]]. The [[Cayuse Pass|Cayuse]] and [[Chinook Pass|Chinook]] Passes east of Mount Rainier also close in winter.\n\nWashington is crossed by a number of freight railroads, and Amtrak's passenger [[Amtrak Cascades|Cascade route]] between Eugene, Oregon and Vancouver, BC is the eighth busiest Amtrak service in the U.S. Seattle's [[King Street Station]], the busiest station in Washington, and 15th busiest in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|title=Amtrak|website=www.amtrak.com|access-date=January 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214015155/https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|archive-date=December 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> serves as the terminus for the two long distance Amtrak routes in Washington, the [[Empire Builder]] to Chicago and the [[Coast Starlight]] to Los Angeles.

A 2004 study of 40 mothers from Oregon, Washington, [[British Columbia]], and Montana found PBDEs in the breast milk of every woman tested.\n\nThree recent studies by the [[Washington State Department of Ecology]] showed toxic chemicals banned decades ago linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish from 45 sites. The toxic substances included [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]; [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], two chlorinated pesticides, [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] and [[dieldrin]], and PBDEs. As a result of the study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the [[Washington State Department of Health]] advises the public not to eat [[mountain whitefish]] from the [[Wenatchee River]] from [[Leavenworth, Washington|Leavenworth]] downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs.

Washington has voted for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nominee in every election since [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]].\n\nDue to Western Washington's large population, Democrats usually fare better statewide.

Named for [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States|U.S. president]], the state was made out of the western part of the [[Washington Territory]], which was ceded by the [[British Empire]] in 1846, in accordance with the [[Oregon Treaty]] in the settlement of the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. The state, which is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Oregon]] to the south, [[Idaho]] to the east, and the [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] to the north, was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] is the [[state capital]]; the state's largest city is [[Seattle]]. Washington is often referred to as '''Washington State''' to distinguish it from the nation's capital, [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\nWashington is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|18th largest state]], with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 km<sup>2</sup>), and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|13th most populous]] state, with more than 7.6 million people. Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], the center of transportation, business, and industry along [[Puget Sound]], an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep [[fjord]]s, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep [[temperate rainforest]]s in the west; [[mountain range]]s in the west, central, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Western United States]], after [[California]]. [[Mount Rainier]], an active [[stratovolcano]], is the state's highest elevation, at almost {{convert|14411|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, and is the most [[topographically prominent]] mountain in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous U.S.]]\n\nWashington is a leading lumber producer; its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. Washington is the nation's largest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. Washington ranks second only to California in wine production.\n\nManufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding, and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has more than a thousand dams, including the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage.\n\nWashington is one of the [[List of U.S. states by income|wealthiest]] and most socially progressive states in the country.{{dubious|date=March 2020}}{{Fact|date=March 2020}} The state consistently ranks among the best for [[life expectancy]] and low [[unemployment]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|title=America's best states to live in, ranked|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=November 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107001023/https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|archive-date=November 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Along with [[Colorado]], Washington was one of the [[Cannabis in Washington (state)|first to legalize medicinal and recreational]] [[cannabis]], was among the first thirty-six states to legalize [[same-sex marriage]], doing so in 2012, and was one of only four U.S. states to have been providing legal [[abortion]]s [[Abortion in the United States#History|on request]] before the 1973 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Roe v.

Similarly, Washington voters approved a [[Washington Death with Dignity Act|2008 referendum]] on legalization of [[assisted suicide|physician-assisted suicide]], and is currently one of only five states, along with [[Oregon]], [[California]], [[Colorado]] and [[Vermont]], as well as [[Washington, D.C.|the District of Columbia]] to have legalized the practice.

A [[Mediterranean Climate]] predominates in western Washington, and a much drier [[semi-arid climate]] prevails east of the Cascade Range. Major factors determining Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] and [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]] systems of the north Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade mountains. In the spring and summer, a high pressure [[anticyclone]] system dominates the north Pacific Ocean, causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion. For Washington, this means [[prevailing winds]] from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably [[dry season]].\n\nIn the autumn and winter, a low-pressure [[cyclone]] system takes over in the north Pacific Ocean. The air spiraling inward in a counter-clockwise fashion causes Washington's prevailing winds to come from the southwest, and bring relatively warm and moist air masses and a predictably [[wet season]]. The term \"[[Pineapple Express]]\" is used colloquially to describe [[atmospheric river]] events, where repeated storm systems are directed by this persistent cyclone from tropical and near-tropical Pacific regions into the Pacific Northwest.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kruckeberg | first = Arthur R. | title = The Natural History of Puget Sound Country | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1991 | pages = 42\u201343 | isbn = 978-0-295-97477-4}}</ref>\n\nDespite western Washington's having a marine climate similar to many coastal cities of Europe, there are exceptions such as the \"Big Snow\" events of 1880, 1881, 1893, and 1916, and the \"deep freeze\" winters of 1883\u20131884, 1915\u20131916, 1949\u20131950, and 1955\u20131956, among others.

During the El Ni\u00f1o phase, the jet stream enters the U.S. farther south through California, therefore late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snowpack. The La Ni\u00f1a phase reinforces the jet stream through the Pacific Northwest, causing Washington to have more rain and snow than average.\n\nIn 2006, the Climate Impacts Group at the [[University of Washington]] published ''The Impacts of Climate change in Washington's Economy'', a preliminary assessment on the risks and opportunities presented given the possibility of a rise in global temperatures and their effects on Washington state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/climatechange/economic_impacts.htm |title=Climate Change\u2014Economic Impacts |publisher=Ecy.wa.gov |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730040420/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/climatechange/economic_impacts.htm |archivedate=July 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n====Rain shadow effects====\n\n{{main|Rain shadow}}\n\n[[File:Wa rain map.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Washington experiences extensive variation in rainfall.]]\n\nRainfall in Washington varies dramatically going from east to west. The Olympic Peninsula's western side receives as much as {{convert|160|in}} of precipitation annually, making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a [[temperate rainforest]]. Weeks may pass without a clear day. The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall (in some places more than {{convert|200|in|disp=or|sp=us}} water equivalent) in the country. In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only {{convert|6|in}}. Precipitation then increases again eastward toward the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe Olympic mountains and Cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing [[orographic lift]] of the air masses blown inland from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels. This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range. In both cases the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild, cool temperatures. While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher elevations. [[Mount Baker]], near the state's northern border, is one of the snowiest places in the world. In 1999, it set the world record for snowfall in a single season\u2014{{convert|1140|in|ft m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases99/aug99/noaa99056.html | title = Mt.

Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central [[Columbia Plateau]]\u2014especially the region just east of the Columbia River from about the Snake River to the [[Okanagan Highland]].

He claimed the coastal lands up to [[Prince William Sound]] for Spain as part of their claimed rights under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which they maintained made the Pacific a \"Spanish lake\" and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire.\n\nIn 1778, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] explorer Captain [[James Cook]] sighted [[Cape Flattery]], at the entrance to the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], but Cook did not realize the strait existed. It was not discovered until [[Charles William Barkley]], captain of the ''[[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]]'', sighted it in 1787. The straits were further explored by [[Spain|Spanish explorers]] [[Manuel Quimper]] in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791, and British explorer [[George Vancouver]] in 1792.\n\n===Settlement===\n\n{{Main|Oregon pioneer history}}\n\nThe British-Spanish [[Nootka Convention]] of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States. American captain [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]] (for whom [[Grays Harbor County, Washington|Grays Harbor County]] is named) then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River. He named the river after his ship, the [[Columbia Rediviva|''Columbia'']]. Beginning in 1792, Gray established trade in [[sea otter]] pelts. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] entered the state on October 10, 1805.\n\nExplorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], on his voyage down the Columbia River, camped at the confluence with the Snake River on July 9, 1811, and erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the [[North West Company]] to build a trading post at the site.\n[[File:Fort Nez Perces Trading 1841.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Fur trading at [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s]] in 1841]]\n\nBritain and the United States agreed to what has since been described as \"joint occupancy\" of lands west of the [[Continental Divide]] to the Pacific Ocean as part of the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], which established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary west from [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues, west to the Pacific, was deferred until a later time. Spain, in 1819, ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States, although these rights did not include possession.\n\nNegotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was highly contested between Britain and the United States. Disputed joint-occupancy by Britain and the U.S. lasted for several decades. With American settlers pouring into [[Oregon Country]], [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the [[Columbia District]].\n\nFur trapper [[James Sinclair (fur trader)|James Sinclair]], on orders from [[George Simpson (administrator)|Sir George Simpson]], Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, led some 200 settlers from the [[Red River Colony]] west in 1841 to settle on Hudson Bay Company farms near [[Fort Vancouver]]. The party crossed the Rockies into the [[Columbia Valley]], near present-day [[Radium Hot Springs]], British Columbia, then traveled south-west down the [[Kootenai River]] and Columbia River. Despite such efforts, Britain eventually ceded all claims to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States in the [[Oregon Treaty]] on June 15, 1846.\n\nIn 1836, a group of missionaries, including [[Marcus Whitman]], established several missions and Whitman's own settlement Waiilatpu, in what is now southeastern Washington state, near present day [[Walla Walla County, Washington|Walla Walla County]], in territory of both the [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] and the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] Indian tribes. Whitman's settlement would in 1843 help the [[Oregon Trail]], the overland emigration route to the west, get established for thousands of emigrants in the following decades. Marcus provided medical care for the Native Americans, but when Indian patients\u2014lacking immunity to new, \"European\" diseases\u2014died in striking numbers, while at the same time many white patients recovered, they held \"medicine man\" Marcus Whitman personally responsible, and murdered Whitman and twelve other white settlers in the [[Whitman massacre]] in 1847. This event triggered the [[Cayuse War]] between settlers and Indians.\n\n[[Fort Nisqually]], a farm and trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company and the first European settlement in the [[Puget Sound]] area, was founded in 1833. Black pioneer [[George Washington Bush]] and his Caucasian wife, Isabella James Bush, from [[Missouri]] and [[Tennessee]], respectively, led four white families into the territory and founded New Market, now [[Tumwater, Washington|Tumwater]], in 1846. They settled in Washington to avoid Oregon's discriminatory settlement laws.<ref>{{cite web | title = Articles on George Washington Bush | publisher = City of Tumwater, WA | url = http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm | accessdate = June 15, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070714212032/http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm\n| archivedate = July 14, 2007 }}</ref> After them, many more settlers, migrating overland along the Oregon Trail, wandered north to settle in the Puget Sound area.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{Main|Oregon boundary dispute|Provisional Government of Oregon|Oregon Treaty|Oregon Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Washington Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Seattle - looking east on Yesler Way, 1887.jpg|thumb|Seattle in 1887]]\n\nThe growing populace of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory.

In eastern Washington, the [[Yakima River]] Valley became known for its apple orchards, while the growth of wheat using [[Dryland farming|dry farming]] techniques became particularly productive. Heavy rainfall to the west of the Cascade Range produced dense forests, and the ports along Puget Sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products, particularly the [[Douglas fir]]. Other industries that developed in the state included fishing, salmon canning and mining.\n\n===Industrial era===\n\n[[File:B-17Es at Boeing Plant, Seattle, Washington, 1943.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]] bombers under construction, circa{{nbsp}}1942]]\n\nFor a long period, [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] had large smelters where gold, silver, copper, and lead ores were treated. [[Seattle]] was the primary port for trade with Alaska and the rest of the country, and for a time, it possessed a large shipbuilding industry. The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and the [[Boeing]] company became an established icon in the area.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], a series of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]] were constructed along the Columbia river as part of a project to increase the production of electricity. This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], the largest concrete structure in the United States.\n\nDuring World War II, the state became a focus for war industries. While the Boeing Company produced many of the nation's [[heavy bomber]]s, ports in Seattle, [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], and Tacoma were available for the manufacture of warships. Seattle was the point of departure for many soldiers in the Pacific, a number of whom were quartered at [[Golden Gardens Park]]. In eastern Washington, the [[Hanford Site|Hanford Works]] [[Nuclear power|atomic energy]] plant was opened in 1943, and played a major role in the construction of the nation's [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bombs]].\n\n===Mount St. Helens eruption, 1980===\n\n{{Main|1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens}}\n\nOn May 18, 1980, following a period of heavy tremors and eruptions, the northeast face of [[Mount St. Helens]] [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|erupted violently]], destroying a large part of the top of the volcano.

The North Cascades Highway, [[Washington State Route 20|State Route 20]], closes every year due to snowfall and avalanches in the area of [[Washington Pass]]. The [[Cayuse Pass|Cayuse]] and [[Chinook Pass|Chinook]] Passes east of Mount Rainier also close in winter.\n\nWashington is crossed by a number of freight railroads, and Amtrak's passenger [[Amtrak Cascades|Cascade route]] between Eugene, Oregon and Vancouver, BC is the eighth busiest Amtrak service in the U.S. Seattle's [[King Street Station]], the busiest station in Washington, and 15th busiest in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|title=Amtrak|website=www.amtrak.com|access-date=January 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214015155/https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|archive-date=December 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> serves as the terminus for the two long distance Amtrak routes in Washington, the [[Empire Builder]] to Chicago and the [[Coast Starlight]] to Los Angeles.

A 2004 study of 40 mothers from Oregon, Washington, [[British Columbia]], and Montana found PBDEs in the breast milk of every woman tested.\n\nThree recent studies by the [[Washington State Department of Ecology]] showed toxic chemicals banned decades ago linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish from 45 sites. The toxic substances included [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]]; [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], two chlorinated pesticides, [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] and [[dieldrin]], and PBDEs. As a result of the study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the [[Washington State Department of Health]] advises the public not to eat [[mountain whitefish]] from the [[Wenatchee River]] from [[Leavenworth, Washington|Leavenworth]] downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs.

Washington has voted for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nominee in every election since [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]].\n\nDue to Western Washington's large population, Democrats usually fare better statewide.

Wrestlers portrayed either a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] or [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] gimmick as they followed a series of events which generally built tension, leading to a wrestling match. The name of a wrestler's character was not always the person's [[birth name]], as wrestlers often use a [[stage name]] to portray their character. As a narrative, events are usually pre-planned in order to promote a show or match. The main plotline for the event featured a fourteen-man tournament, including a rematch of [[WrestleMania III]]'s main event.\n\n====Andr\u00e9 vs Hogan====\n[[File:Andr\u00e9 the Giant in the late '80s.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] (pictured) and [[Hulk Hogan]] would meet in the quarter-finals of the championship tournament, having headlined the event the year prior.]]\n\nThe most heavily promoted [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] heading into the event was between [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]], similar to the year before when the two met at [[WrestleMania III]]. In January 1987, Hogan was awarded a trophy for his third year as [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]], while Hogan's on-screen friend Andr\u00e9 was awarded a smaller trophy than Hogan's for being undefeated in the WWF for the previous fifteen years.<ref name=\"slam_Andr\" /><ref name=\"Andreheel\" /> Hogan congratulated Andr\u00e9 over winning the award, but Andr\u00e9 exited the arena before Hogan's speech was finished. In February, on an episode of [[Piper's Pit]], Andr\u00e9 announced his new [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], [[Bobby Heenan]], Hogan's longtime on-screen rival.<ref name=\"Andreheel\" /> Hogan asked Andr\u00e9 to leave Heenan, to which Andr\u00e9 refused.<ref name=\"Andreheel\" /> Andr\u00e9 then challenged Hogan to a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at [[WrestleMania III]], before ripping off Hogan's Hulkamania shirt and golden cross necklace, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turning]] from an on-screen hero to villain ([[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]).<ref name=\"Andreheel\" /> At WrestleMania III Hogan defeated Andr\u00e9 to retain the title.<ref name=\"5WLXC\" /> \n\nAt [[Survivor Series (1987)|the first Survivor Series]] in November 1987, Andr\u00e9 along with team members [[One Man Gang]], [[King Kong Bundy]], [[Butch Reed]] and [[Rick Rude]] defeated Hogan, [[Paul Orndorff]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Ken Patera]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] in a traditional [[Survivor Series#Survivor Series matches|Survivor Series match]].<ref name=\"c6oJf\" /> Shortly after Survivor Series, during Hogan's WWF World Heavyweight Championship defense against Bundy, Andr\u00e9 sneak-attacked Hogan, applying a chokehold. Heel character [[Ted DiBiase]] was [[gimmick|portrayed]] as \"The Million Dollar Man\", an evil millionaire, offered Hogan a large sum of money to sell DiBiase the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, to which Hogan refused. At [[Royal Rumble (1988)|the first Royal Rumble]] in January 1988, Hogan and Andr\u00e9 had an official contract signing for a WWF World Heavyweight Championship rematch.<ref name=\"rIsNh\" /> Their rematch took place on ''[[The Main Event I]]'' in February, where Andr\u00e9 defeated Hogan with a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Screwjob|dusty finish]].<ref name=\"THOW\" /> Andr\u00e9 won the match when referee [[Dave Hebner]]'s identical twin [[Earl Hebner]] made the decision.<ref name=\"SNME - Hogan vs Andr\u00e9\" /><ref name=\"andr\u00e91\" /> \n\nShortly after being awarded the championship, Andr\u00e9 would [[kayfabe]] sell the title to DiBiase.<ref name=\"andr\u00e91\" /> Whilst Andr\u00e9's championship reign is recognized by the WWF, DiBiase would be stripped of the title. Plotwise, WWF President [[Jack Tunney]] vacated the title due to it having not been won in a sanctioned match and ordered it to be decided in a [[single elimination]] 14-man tournament at WrestleMania IV.<ref name=\"SNME - Hogan vs Andr\u00e9\" /> As previous champions, Andr\u00e9 and Hogan would get a [[bye (sports)|bye]] to the second round of the tournament, but would face each other in their second-round matchup.<ref name=\"andr\u00e91\" />\n\nHogan would form an unlikely alliance with a former enemy and top challenger to his WWF World Heavyweight Championship, [[Randy Savage|Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage]] (which was later known as the [[Mega Powers]]). Savage had been portrayed as an [[egomaniacal]] heel during most of his first two years in the WWF, but in the late summer of 1987 began to slowly turn face.<ref name=\"lastword\" /> Their on-screen friendship, then, was formed when Hogan (at the persuasion of Savage's valet, [[Miss Elizabeth]]) intervened when Savage was being attacked by [[The Honky Tonk Man]] and [[the Hart Foundation]] in an [[Angle (professional wrestling)|angle]]. Although Hogan and Savage teamed together at un-televised house shows, nothing more was made of it on national television until shortly before WrestleMania IV, when Hogan rescued Savage a similar angle featuring Andre, DiBiase and [[Virgil (wrestler)|Virgil]].<ref name=\"lastword\" /><ref name=\"bleachersummary\" />\n\n====Undercard====\nLower on the card, [[Brutus Beefcake]] was challenging for the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]], held by [[The Honky Tonk Man]]. Beefcake - who had the gimmick of a haircutter who would regularly cut wrestler's hair after matches - had previous experience of Honky having tagged previously - had vowed: \"to cut his [[ducktail]] hair.\"<ref name=\"bleachersummary\" /> Honky, meanwhile, was portrayed as a cowardly champion, frequently relying on outside interference from manager [[Jimmy Hart]] or on-screen girlfriend [[Sherri Martel|Peggy Sue]] to win matches,<ref name=\"bleachersummary\" /> or intentionally getting himself counted out or disqualified to retain his championship with the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Championship advantage|champions advantage]].<ref name=\"bleachersummary\" />\n\nHaving debuted the year previously, in his first major feud, [[The Ultimate Warrior]] began battling with [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]] over which character was the stronger, gladiatorial-style superstar was in the WWF. During a match on WWF television, Hercules attacked Warrior with his steel chain after a [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|chain match]] in an angle.<ref name=\"lastword\" /> [[The British Bulldogs]] and [[The Islanders (professional wrestling)|The Islanders]] had feuded since the late fall of 1987. The Islanders would take the Bulldogs' [[mascot]], Matilda the [[bulldog]], from ringside. Bobby Heenan, manager of the Islanders commented on the legality of having animals at ringside rather than official managers. This included a remark on [[Koko B. Ware]]'s [[macaw]] who accompanied him to ringside. This would lead to a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Multiple man teamed matches|Six-man tag team match]] with manager Heenan tagging with the Islanders against the Bulldogs and Ware.<ref name=\"bleachersummary\" /><ref name=\"lastword\" />\n\n==Event==\nWrestleMania IV's coverage began with [[Gladys Knight]] singing a rendition of ''\"[[America the Beautiful]]\"''. The first match of the pay-per-view event was a twenty-man over the top rope [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]].{{efn|The participants were [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]], [[The Bolsheviks]] ([[Nikolai Volkoff]] and [[Jim Barrell|Boris Zhukov]]), [[The Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart]]), [[The Killer Bees (professional wrestling)|The Killer Bees]] ([[B.

The duo [[double team]]ed Dog before Brown attempted a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]] on Dog but hit Hart instead. Junkyard Dog hit both men with several [[headbutt]]s before they both decided to cooperate and they eliminated Junkyard Dog. After eliminating Dog, Hart indicated that he and Brown would share the trophy; however, Brown caught Hart with his [[Professional wrestling attacks#Enzuigiri|Ghetto Blaster]] before eliminating him over the top rope to win the battle royal.<ref name=\"wweresults\" /> Brown was presented with the trophy, but Hart interrupted and hit Brown with the trophy.

As One Man Gang had received a bye in the quarter-finals due to Rick Rude and Jake Roberts having wrestled to a time limit draw in the first round Gang would face Savage in the semi-finals.<ref name=\"wweresults\" /><ref name=\"powerdriver\" />\n\n[[Brutus Beefcake|Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake]] fought [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Champion]] [[The Honky Tonk Man]] for the Intercontinental championship.<ref name=\"powerdriver\" /> Early in the match, Beefcake connected with an [[Professional wrestling throws#Atomic drop|atomic drop]] at the outset of the matchup. Beefcake then hit Honky with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#High knee|high knee]], before missing an [[Professional wrestling attacks#Elbow drop|elbow drop]] on Honky, who took control with a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving fist drop|second turnbuckle fist drop]]. Honky went for his [[Neckbreaker#Swinging neckbreaker|Swinging neckbreaker]] called Shake, Rattle & Roll on Beefcake but instead Beefcake kneed him in the face.<ref name=\"pwh\" /> Beefcake would put Honky in a sleeper hold. With Beefcake in charge of the match, Honky's manager Jimmy Hart hit the referee with his [[megaphone]]. The bell didn't ring but it was announced that Beefcake won by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]], which meant that Honky was still the champion.{{efn|Like other professional wrestling championships, they can only be won or loss by pinfall, submission or knockout unless stated in the stipulations placed before the match.<ref name=\"pwwew.net\" />}}<ref name=\"pwwew.net\" /> Post-match, with Honky Tonk apparently knocked out in the ring, Beefcake cut the hair of Hart with his barber [[Hair-cutting shears|shears]].<ref name=\"wweresults\" />\n\n[[The Islanders (professional wrestling)|The Islanders]] ([[Tonga Fifita|Haku]] and [[Sam Fatu|Tama]]) and manager [[Bobby Heenan]] took on [[The British Bulldogs]] ([[Davey Boy Smith]] and [[Dynamite Kid]]) and [[Koko B. Ware]] in a six-man tag team match. Dynamite and Tama started the match with Dynamite [[Professional wrestling throws#Catapult|catapult]]ing Tama over the top rope. Smith tagged in but missed an [[Professional wrestling attacks|elbow drop]] on Tama, allowing Tama to tag Haku.<ref name=\"pwh\" /> Smith hit a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving crossbody|flying crossbody]] on Haku for a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Near-fall|near-fall]]. Haku hit an arm wrench and tagged Tama. Tama grabbed Smith's arm and came out of it with a [[Professional wrestling throws#Gorilla press drop|military press slam]]. Tama tagged in Haku who put Davey in a [[backbreaker]] but Smith flipped out of it and tagged in Koko.<ref name=\"powerdriver\" /> He hit Haku with a [[Dropkick#Missile dropkick|missile dropkick]] and a [[Professional wrestling throws#Frankensteiner|Frankensteiner]]. Dynamite tagged in and clotheslined Haku before ran into Haku's boot. As a cowardly manager, Heenan tagged and stomped Dynamite before quickly tagging out to Tama. Tama hit a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] on Dynamite but missed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big splash|big splash]] to allow Dynamite to tag Koko whilst Tama tagged Haku.<ref name=\"pwwew.net\" /> Both members of the Islanders would square up to Koko prompting the Bulldogs to enter the ring. All six men brawled in the ring before being separated by the referee, who ordered the Bulldogs into their corner. The Islanders used this distraction to pick up Heenan and throw him onto Koko, leading to a pinfall victory.<ref name=\"wweresults\" />\n\n===Semifinals===\nNext, Randy Savage faced One Man Gang for a place in the final of the tournament. Ted DiBiase had already received a bye in the semi-finals due to the double disqualification of Hulk Hogan and Andr\u00e9 the Giant and would meet the victor. Savage hit a [[Professional wrestling throws#Flapjack|hotshot]] on the One Man Gang, but Gang quickly took control of the match. Gang would attempt a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big splash|747 splash]], but miss after Savage dodged and later fell to the outside as Savage connected with a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving double axe handle|diving double axe handle]]. Savage then went for a [[Professional wrestling throws#Scoop slam|scoop slam]] which failed.<ref name=\"wweresults\" /><ref name=\"powerdriver\" /> One Man Gang's manager Slick jumped on the apron and handed One Man Gang a [[Cane (walking stick)|cane]]; which he hit Savage with and attempted to jab him as he lay on the mat but Savage kept rolling away. The [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] caught Gang using his cane and disqualified him awarding the match to Savage.<ref name=\"pwh\" /> \n\nBefore the final round, [[Strike Force (professional wrestling)|Strike Force]] ([[Tito Santana]] and [[Rick Martel]]) defended the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]] against [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] ([[Bill Eadie|Ax]] and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]]) with their manager [[Harry Fujiwara|Mr. Fuji]] in their corner.<ref name=\"slam_Rick\" /> The match started with Strike Force hitting Smash with a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers|double]] [[Professional wrestling attacks#Back elbow|back elbow]] for a near-fall. Santana applied an [[armlock|armbar]] on Ax before Martel tagged in and applied an armbar but Ax [[headbutt]]ed him and tagged out to Smash. Santana tagged in but was caught in a [[bear hug]] and was [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]]d by Ax, before a [[Professional wrestling throws#Scoop slam|scoop slam]] and [[suplex]] on Santana.<ref name=\"fBzKy\" /><ref name=\"pwwew.net\" /> Santana hit a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Flying forearm smash|flying forearm smash]] on an interfering Smash and tagged in Martel who [[dropkick]]ed both Ax and Smash a number of times and applied a [[Boston crab]] on Smash. Santana grabbed Mr. Fuji up onto the apron, allowing Ax to get his manager's cane. He nailed Martel with it as Smash covered Martel with a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pin]]. As a result, Demolition won the match, and the WWF Tag Team Champions.<ref name=\"wweresults\" /><ref name=\"powerdriver\" />\n\n=== Main event ===\nThe [[Card (sports)|main event]] of WrestleMania IV was the tournament final for the vacant [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] between \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage and \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase.<ref name=\"f4wo_Dail\" /> DiBiase was accompanied to the ring by Andre The Giant, whilst Savage his regular valet Miss Elizabeth. Savage had wrestled three prior matches, whilst DiBiase had wrestled one less, received a bye from the quarterfinals. DiBiase controlled much of the match, before a fightback from Savage, and attempted a top rope [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving elbow drop|elbow drop]] on DiBiase but DiBiase moved out of the way. DiBiase applied a [[Professional wrestling holds#Cobra clutch|Million Dollar Dream]] submission on Savage.<ref name=\"pwh\" /> To aid Savage, Elizabeth would go backstage and bring Hulk Hogan to ringside to neutralize Andr\u00e9 being at ringside.<ref name=\"pwwew.net\" /><ref name=\"f4w savage\" />\n\nAndr\u00e9 the Giant would interfere in the match on behalf of DiBiase, and whilst the referee was distracted, Hogan would attack DiBiase with a [[Foreign object (professional wrestling)|steel chair]].<ref name=\"QxQI4\" /> Savage climbed up the top rope for a second elbow drop attempt and hit the Savage Elbow. He followed it up with a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] victory.<ref name=\"Fox\" /> He won the tournament and the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Hogan, Elizabeth and Savage celebrated Savage's WWF Championship win.<ref name=\"WrestleMania - Savage vs DiBiase\" /><ref name=\"wweresults\" /><ref name=\"powerdriver\" />\n\n==Reception==\n{{quote box|width=40%|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote= This show could have been so much better had they trimmed the tournament down to eight guys from fourteen.\n|source= \u2014Rob McNew of ''411Mania.com''<ref name=\"411mania\" />\n}}\n\nWrestleMania IV received mixed to poor reviews from critics. Most reviews criticized the show's length as well as the number of matches.\n<!-- Too Many Matches -->\nRob McNew from ''411Mania.com'' gave the show a 3.5/10 rating when reviewing the show, claiming the show was \"bad\".<ref name=\"411mania\" /> McNew was frustrated by the number of matches on the show, and the size of the tournament, saying \"This show could have been so much better had they trimmed the tournament down to eight guys from fourteen. Instead, we got a bunch of short matches, none of which ended up being memorable. The show had its moments and isn't all terrible. Just way too long. Savage-Dibiase provides a great moment, but the rest of the show is a pass.\"<ref name=\"411mania\" /> ''Retoprowrestling.com'' was also highly critical of the show's length, calling it \"a chore to watch\",<ref name=\"retroPW\" /> and that \"there's probably nothing wrong with a wrestling pay per view running nigh on four hours, but when about three and a half of those hours don't actually feature much in the way of entertainment, it often feels like you've spent your entire weekend just watching this one show.\"<ref name=\"retroPW\" />\n\nJohn Canton of ''TJR wrestling'' called the event \"a below-average show\", citing the event being \"a 16 match card. That\u2019s too many matches.\"<ref name=\"TJR\" /> Canton also commented on the length of these matches, and primary usage of \"rest holds\", and bad finishes.<ref name=\"TJR\" /> Bryan Rose from ''Voices of Wrestling'' called the show a \"dud\", before stating there was a \"lot of nothing for 3 1/2 hours.\" Rose also suggested similarities that the event's length had to watch two [[The Godfather (film series)|Godfather]] films.<ref name=\"uhSzA\" /> Mike Powell of ''prowrestling.net'' called the event \"really bad\", and commented that had the show been less than three hours in length, rather than 4, it would have been an allround better show.<ref name=\"fBzKy\" /> \n\n<!-- Positive Reviews -->\nHowever, John Powell, from ''SLAM! Wrestling'' called the event \"excellent\", saying that the show's greatness comes from its unpredictability.<ref name=\"slam_SLAM\" /> Powell,  says that the show was \"another tricky venture for Vince McMahon and he hits the jackpot again.\"<ref name=\"slam_SLAM\" /> Powell was very positive about the show's tournament, stating that it and Savage's title win was the highlights of the night.<ref name=\"slam_SLAM\" /> Bret Mix from ''Wrestling DVD Network'' commented on the structure of the event, before calling the event \"average\", but \"underrated\" for its high quality of matches throughout the show, despite the number of matches.<ref name=\"dURcL\" />\n\n<!-- Mania 5 -->\nAs an event in the annual [[WrestleMania]] series of events, WrestleMania IV is considered to be one of the weaker events; with reviews commenting that the event was most notable for a year-long feud between [[Randy Savage]] and [[Hulk Hogan]] that preceded the event, with the two facing off a year later at [[WrestleMania V]].<ref name=\"iAyOr\" /> Scott Keith of ''SmarK rant'' gave the event a \"recommendation to avoid\", and commented it was \"long, boring (and) dull\", and that the event was simply to \"serve as a prelude to WrestleMania V\"<ref name=\"BPF0B\" />\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn the months that followed the event, Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship on multiple occasions, primarily against DiBiase but also granted title shots to others such as the One Man Gang and Bad News Brown. Hogan, meanwhile, took a leave of absence from the WWF during the late spring and part of the summer to film the movie ''[[No Holds Barred (1989 film)|No Holds Barred]]''.<ref name=\"f4w savage\" /> Andr\u00e9 the Giant was shortly placed in a feud with \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan, however, the DiBiase-Andr\u00e9 alliance was renewed when the two attacked Savage during a television taping for the WWF's syndicated show ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]''. DiBiase and Andre would offer a tag team match to Savage at the [[SummerSlam (1988)|inaugural SummerSlam]], where Savage would choose to partner Hogan and create \"[[The Mega Powers]]\".<ref name=\"B7wZj\" /><ref name=\"f4w savage\" /> The team of Hogan and Savage won the match before Savage would turn heel against Hogan at ''[[The Main Event II]]''.<ref name=\"QmVSe\" /> Hogan would challenge Savage for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania V]], with Hogan winning the title.<ref name=\"G3WIK\" />\n\nHaving interfered in Duggan's match at the event, Hacksaw confronted Andr\u00e9, and attacked him with his [[Dimensional lumber|2x4]]. This storyline would come to an end before ''Superstars of Wrestling''.<ref name=\"G3WIK\" /> Having wrestled to a time limit draw in the championship tournament, Jake Roberts and Rick Rude were placed into a feud regarding Rude making kayfabe advances over Robert's real-life wife, Cheryl.<ref name=\"twmwrestling\" /> The Honky Tonk Man continued to feud with Brutus Beefcake over the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship during the spring and summer of 1988, with Honky retaining the championship by being intentionally counted out or disqualified on multiple occasions. Beefcake was granted a \"final\" match at SummerSlam, but was sneak attacked by [[Ron Bass]] one week before the event. Honky would then lose his championship at Summerslam to a returning [[The Ultimate Warrior|Ultimate Warrior]].<ref name=\"twmwrestling\" />\n\nDemolition would defend the tag team championships against both Strike Force and The British Bulldogs. The Demolition-Strike Force feud came to an end in June 1988 when, during a televised match, Ax and Smash kayfabe injured Rick Martel by repeatedly using their finishing move, the \"Demolition Decapitation\" on him. Following this, The British Bulldogs and [[The Young Stallions]], and later another power team, [[The Powers of Pain]] ([[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]] and [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]]), became Demolition's primary challengers.<ref name=\"came_WWEW\" /> Following Bret Hart's elimination from the battle royal, he returned to the ring to challenge Bad News Brown.<ref name=\"xJxtZ\" /><ref name=\"13V3n\" /> Bret would see a face turn, alongside partner [[Jim Neidhart]].

The announced attendance of the event was 19,199, drawing a 6.5 buyrate on PPV.\n\nThe [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]] featured as the finals of a one-night [[Professional wrestling tournament|fourteen-man single elimination tournament]] for the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|Undisputed WWF Heavyweight Championship]], in which [[Randy Savage]] defeated [[Ted DiBiase]] to win the vacant title. The main matches on the [[Card (sports)#Undercard|undercard]] were a twenty-man [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] won by [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]], [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] ([[Bill Eadie|Ax]] and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]]) versus [[Strike Force (professional wrestling)|Strike Force]] ([[Tito Santana]] and [[Rick Martel]]) for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]], and [[Brutus Beefcake]] versus [[The Honky Tonk Man]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]].\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[World Wrestling Federation]]'s (WWF, now WWE) flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

Wrestlers portrayed either a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] or [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] gimmick as they followed a series of events which generally built tension, leading to a wrestling match. The name of a wrestler's character was not always the person's [[birth name]], as wrestlers often use a [[stage name]] to portray their character. As a narrative, events are usually pre-planned in order to promote a show or match. The main plotline for the event featured a fourteen-man tournament, including a rematch of [[WrestleMania III]]'s main event.\n\n====Andr\u00e9 vs Hogan====\n[[File:Andr\u00e9 the Giant in the late '80s.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] (pictured) and [[Hulk Hogan]] would meet in the quarter-finals of the championship tournament, having headlined the event the year prior.]]\n\nThe most heavily promoted [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] heading into the event was between [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]], similar to the year before when the two met at [[WrestleMania III]]. In January 1987, Hogan was awarded a trophy for his third year as [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]], while Hogan's on-screen friend Andr\u00e9 was awarded a smaller trophy than Hogan's for being undefeated in the WWF for the previous fifteen years.<ref name=\"slam_Andr\" /><ref name=\"Andreheel\" /> Hogan congratulated Andr\u00e9 over winning the award, but Andr\u00e9 exited the arena before Hogan's speech was finished. In February, on an episode of [[Piper's Pit]], Andr\u00e9 announced his new [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], [[Bobby Heenan]], Hogan's longtime on-screen rival.<ref name=\"Andreheel\" /> Hogan asked Andr\u00e9 to leave Heenan, to which Andr\u00e9 refused.<ref name=\"Andreheel\" /> Andr\u00e9 then challenged Hogan to a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at [[WrestleMania III]], before ripping off Hogan's Hulkamania shirt and golden cross necklace, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turning]] from an on-screen hero to villain ([[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]).<ref name=\"Andreheel\" /> At WrestleMania III Hogan defeated Andr\u00e9 to retain the title.<ref name=\"5WLXC\" /> \n\nAt [[Survivor Series (1987)|the first Survivor Series]] in November 1987, Andr\u00e9 along with team members [[One Man Gang]], [[King Kong Bundy]], [[Butch Reed]] and [[Rick Rude]] defeated Hogan, [[Paul Orndorff]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Ken Patera]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] in a traditional [[Survivor Series#Survivor Series matches|Survivor Series match]].<ref name=\"c6oJf\" /> Shortly after Survivor Series, during Hogan's WWF World Heavyweight Championship defense against Bundy, Andr\u00e9 sneak-attacked Hogan, applying a chokehold. Heel character [[Ted DiBiase]] was [[gimmick|portrayed]] as \"The Million Dollar Man\", an evil millionaire, offered Hogan a large sum of money to sell DiBiase the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, to which Hogan refused. At [[Royal Rumble (1988)|the first Royal Rumble]] in January 1988, Hogan and Andr\u00e9 had an official contract signing for a WWF World Heavyweight Championship rematch.<ref name=\"rIsNh\" /> Their rematch took place on ''[[The Main Event I]]'' in February, where Andr\u00e9 defeated Hogan with a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Screwjob|dusty finish]].<ref name=\"THOW\" /> Andr\u00e9 won the match when referee [[Dave Hebner]]'s identical twin [[Earl Hebner]] made the decision.<ref name=\"SNME - Hogan vs Andr\u00e9\" /><ref name=\"andr\u00e91\" /> \n\nShortly after being awarded the championship, Andr\u00e9 would [[kayfabe]] sell the title to DiBiase.<ref name=\"andr\u00e91\" /> Whilst Andr\u00e9's championship reign is recognized by the WWF, DiBiase would be stripped of the title. Plotwise, WWF President [[Jack Tunney]] vacated the title due to it having not been won in a sanctioned match and ordered it to be decided in a [[single elimination]] 14-man tournament at WrestleMania IV.<ref name=\"SNME - Hogan vs Andr\u00e9\" /> As previous champions, Andr\u00e9 and Hogan would get a [[bye (sports)|bye]] to the second round of the tournament, but would face each other in their second-round matchup.<ref name=\"andr\u00e91\" />\n\nHogan would form an unlikely alliance with a former enemy and top challenger to his WWF World Heavyweight Championship, [[Randy Savage|Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage]] (which was later known as the [[Mega Powers]]). Savage had been portrayed as an [[egomaniacal]] heel during most of his first two years in the WWF, but in the late summer of 1987 began to slowly turn face.<ref name=\"lastword\" /> Their on-screen friendship, then, was formed when Hogan (at the persuasion of Savage's valet, [[Miss Elizabeth]]) intervened when Savage was being attacked by [[The Honky Tonk Man]] and [[the Hart Foundation]] in an [[Angle (professional wrestling)|angle]]. Although Hogan and Savage teamed together at un-televised house shows, nothing more was made of it on national television until shortly before WrestleMania IV, when Hogan rescued Savage a similar angle featuring Andre, DiBiase and [[Virgil (wrestler)|Virgil]].<ref name=\"lastword\" /><ref name=\"bleachersummary\" />\n\n====Undercard====\nLower on the card, [[Brutus Beefcake]] was challenging for the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]], held by [[The Honky Tonk Man]]. Beefcake - who had the gimmick of a haircutter who would regularly cut wrestler's hair after matches - had previous experience of Honky having tagged previously - had vowed: \"to cut his [[ducktail]] hair.\"<ref name=\"bleachersummary\" /> Honky, meanwhile, was portrayed as a cowardly champion, frequently relying on outside interference from manager [[Jimmy Hart]] or on-screen girlfriend [[Sherri Martel|Peggy Sue]] to win matches,<ref name=\"bleachersummary\" /> or intentionally getting himself counted out or disqualified to retain his championship with the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Championship advantage|champions advantage]].<ref name=\"bleachersummary\" />\n\nHaving debuted the year previously, in his first major feud, [[The Ultimate Warrior]] began battling with [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]] over which character was the stronger, gladiatorial-style superstar was in the WWF. During a match on WWF television, Hercules attacked Warrior with his steel chain after a [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|chain match]] in an angle.<ref name=\"lastword\" /> [[The British Bulldogs]] and [[The Islanders (professional wrestling)|The Islanders]] had feuded since the late fall of 1987. The Islanders would take the Bulldogs' [[mascot]], Matilda the [[bulldog]], from ringside. Bobby Heenan, manager of the Islanders commented on the legality of having animals at ringside rather than official managers. This included a remark on [[Koko B. Ware]]'s [[macaw]] who accompanied him to ringside. This would lead to a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Multiple man teamed matches|Six-man tag team match]] with manager Heenan tagging with the Islanders against the Bulldogs and Ware.<ref name=\"bleachersummary\" /><ref name=\"lastword\" />\n\n==Event==\nWrestleMania IV's coverage began with [[Gladys Knight]] singing a rendition of ''\"[[America the Beautiful]]\"''. The first match of the pay-per-view event was a twenty-man over the top rope [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]].{{efn|The participants were [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]], [[The Bolsheviks]] ([[Nikolai Volkoff]] and [[Jim Barrell|Boris Zhukov]]), [[The Hart Foundation]] ([[Bret Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart]]), [[The Killer Bees (professional wrestling)|The Killer Bees]] ([[B. Brian Blair]] and [[Jim Brunzell]]), [[Dangerous Danny Davis|Danny Davis]], [[George Steele]], [[Harley Race]], [[Hillbilly Jim]], [[The Fabulous Rougeaus|The Rougeau Brothers]] ([[Jacques Rougeau|Jacques]] and [[Raymond Rougeau|Raymond]]), [[The Young Stallions]] ([[Paul Roma]] and [[Jim Powers]]), [[Junkyard Dog]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Ron Bass (wrestler)|Ron Bass]], [[Michael Smith (wrestler)|Sam Houston]], and [[Sika Anoa\u02bbi|Sika]].<ref name=\"pwh\" />}} The winner of the match would receive a trophy. After fourteen eliminations, the final six participants were [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]], [[Bret Hart]], [[Paul Roma]], [[Harley Race]], [[Jacques Rougeau]], and [[Junkyard Dog]].<ref name=\"powerdriver\" />\n\nRace hit a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] on Rougeau sending him over the top rope before Junkyard Dog [[Punch (combat)|punch]]ed him over the top rope.<ref name=\"pwwew.net\" /> Brown eliminated Roma as Junkyard Dog was left to battle Hart and Brown. The duo [[double team]]ed Dog before Brown attempted a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]] on Dog but hit Hart instead. Junkyard Dog hit both men with several [[headbutt]]s before they both decided to cooperate and they eliminated Junkyard Dog. After eliminating Dog, Hart indicated that he and Brown would share the trophy; however, Brown caught Hart with his [[Professional wrestling attacks#Enzuigiri|Ghetto Blaster]] before eliminating him over the top rope to win the battle royal.<ref name=\"wweresults\" /> Brown was presented with the trophy, but Hart interrupted and hit Brown with the trophy.

In the first round, [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] (with bodyguard [[Virgil (wrestler)|Virgil]] and [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]]) defeated [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]] by pinfall.<ref name=\"wweresults\" /> [[Don Muraco|\"The Rock\" Don Muraco]] (with [[Superstar Billy Graham]]) defeated [[Dino Bravo]] (with [[Frenchy Martin]]) by disqualification after Bravo pulled the referee in front of him, causing the referee to be hit by a flying forearm from Muraco.<ref name=\"wweresults\" /><ref name=\"powerdriver\" />\n\n[[Randy Savage|\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] (with [[Miss Elizabeth]]) defeated [[Butch Reed|\"The Natural\" Butch Reed]] (with [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]]), [[Greg Valentine|Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine]] (with [[Jimmy Hart|\"The Mouth of the South\" Jimmy Hart]]) defeated [[Ricky Steamboat|Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat]], the [[One Man Gang]] (with Slick) defeated [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] (with [[Oliver Humperdink]]),<ref name=\"espn_Revi\" /> and [[Rick Rude|\"Ravishing\" Rick Rude]] (with [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]]) fought [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]] to a time limit draw. The winners of these matches advanced to the quarterfinals. As Rude and Roberts tied, they were both eliminated from the tournament, thereby giving the One Man Gang a bye into the semifinals. As former champions, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and [[Hulk Hogan]] were given a bye and had directly qualified for the next round.<ref name=\"wweresults\" /><ref name=\"powerdriver\" />\n\nIn his PPV debut, [[The Ultimate Warrior]] faced [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]]. The pair locked up with Warrior [[Professional wrestling attacks#Knife edge chop|chopping]] Hercules in the corner. Hercules fought back as he hit two [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clothesline]]s on Warrior, who [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-sell|no-sold]] them before a third from Hercules took Warrior off his feet. Warrior then countered a Hercules clothesline and hit a clothesline of his own. In the corner, Warrior hit him with ten [[Punch (combat)|punch]]es, but while Warrior was looking at the referee, Hercules hit an [[Professional wrestling throws#Inverted atomic drop|inverted atomic drop]]. He then tried to apply his [[finishing move]], a full-nelson but could not lock his fingers behind Warriors head. Warrior then pushed his feet off the top turnbuckle and both men fell to the mat with both men being pinned.  Warrior lifted a shoulder before the end of the count, awarding Warrior the win.<ref name=\"wweresults\" /><ref name=\"powerdriver\" /><ref name=\"pwh\" /><ref name=\"pwwew.net\" />\n\n=== Quarter-finals ===\n[[Image:Greg Valentine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Greg Valentine]] faced [[Randy Savage]] in the quarterfinals of the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] tournament]]\nThe first of three quarterfinals saw Hulk Hogan take on Andr\u00e9 the Giant. During the match, Hogan hit Andr\u00e9 with a chair in front of [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] [[Joey Marella]]. Andr\u00e9 would retaliate, grabbing the chair and hitting Hogan. After both men hit each other with the chair, they both were disqualified by Marella and, as a result, they both were eliminated from the tournament.<ref name=\"pwto_PWTo\" />\n\nThe second quarterfinal saw Ted DiBiase (without either Andr\u00e9 or Virgil after Virgil had been [[Suplex]]ed in the aisle by Hulk Hogan) defeated Don Muraco by pinfall.<ref name=\"cage_Over\" /> With both of Andr\u00e9 and Hogan disqualified, DiBiase would get a bye to the final.<ref name=\"xngJF\" /> The third quarterfinal saw Randy Savage defeat Greg Valentine also by pinfall. As One Man Gang had received a bye in the quarter-finals due to Rick Rude and Jake Roberts having wrestled to a time limit draw in the first round Gang would face Savage in the semi-finals.<ref name=\"wweresults\" /><ref name=\"powerdriver\" />\n\n[[Brutus Beefcake|Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake]] fought [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Champion]] [[The Honky Tonk Man]] for the Intercontinental championship.<ref name=\"powerdriver\" /> Early in the match, Beefcake connected with an [[Professional wrestling throws#Atomic drop|atomic drop]] at the outset of the matchup.

Ware]] in a six-man tag team match. Dynamite and Tama started the match with Dynamite [[Professional wrestling throws#Catapult|catapult]]ing Tama over the top rope. Smith tagged in but missed an [[Professional wrestling attacks|elbow drop]] on Tama, allowing Tama to tag Haku.<ref name=\"pwh\" /> Smith hit a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving crossbody|flying crossbody]] on Haku for a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Near-fall|near-fall]]. Haku hit an arm wrench and tagged Tama. Tama grabbed Smith's arm and came out of it with a [[Professional wrestling throws#Gorilla press drop|military press slam]]. Tama tagged in Haku who put Davey in a [[backbreaker]] but Smith flipped out of it and tagged in Koko.<ref name=\"powerdriver\" /> He hit Haku with a [[Dropkick#Missile dropkick|missile dropkick]] and a [[Professional wrestling throws#Frankensteiner|Frankensteiner]]. Dynamite tagged in and clotheslined Haku before ran into Haku's boot. As a cowardly manager, Heenan tagged and stomped Dynamite before quickly tagging out to Tama. Tama hit a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] on Dynamite but missed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big splash|big splash]] to allow Dynamite to tag Koko whilst Tama tagged Haku.<ref name=\"pwwew.net\" /> Both members of the Islanders would square up to Koko prompting the Bulldogs to enter the ring. All six men brawled in the ring before being separated by the referee, who ordered the Bulldogs into their corner. The Islanders used this distraction to pick up Heenan and throw him onto Koko, leading to a pinfall victory.<ref name=\"wweresults\" />\n\n===Semifinals===\nNext, Randy Savage faced One Man Gang for a place in the final of the tournament. Ted DiBiase had already received a bye in the semi-finals due to the double disqualification of Hulk Hogan and Andr\u00e9 the Giant and would meet the victor. Savage hit a [[Professional wrestling throws#Flapjack|hotshot]] on the One Man Gang, but Gang quickly took control of the match.

Santana applied an [[armlock|armbar]] on Ax before Martel tagged in and applied an armbar but Ax [[headbutt]]ed him and tagged out to Smash.

Santana grabbed Mr. Fuji up onto the apron, allowing Ax to get his manager's cane. He nailed Martel with it as Smash covered Martel with a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pin]]. As a result, Demolition won the match, and the WWF Tag Team Champions.<ref name=\"wweresults\" /><ref name=\"powerdriver\" />\n\n=== Main event ===\nThe [[Card (sports)|main event]] of WrestleMania IV was the tournament final for the vacant [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] between \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage and \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase.<ref name=\"f4wo_Dail\" /> DiBiase was accompanied to the ring by Andre The Giant, whilst Savage his regular valet Miss Elizabeth. Savage had wrestled three prior matches, whilst DiBiase had wrestled one less, received a bye from the quarterfinals. DiBiase controlled much of the match, before a fightback from Savage, and attempted a top rope [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving elbow drop|elbow drop]] on DiBiase but DiBiase moved out of the way. DiBiase applied a [[Professional wrestling holds#Cobra clutch|Million Dollar Dream]] submission on Savage.<ref name=\"pwh\" /> To aid Savage, Elizabeth would go backstage and bring Hulk Hogan to ringside to neutralize Andr\u00e9 being at ringside.<ref name=\"pwwew.net\" /><ref name=\"f4w savage\" />\n\nAndr\u00e9 the Giant would interfere in the match on behalf of DiBiase, and whilst the referee was distracted, Hogan would attack DiBiase with a [[Foreign object (professional wrestling)|steel chair]].<ref name=\"QxQI4\" /> Savage climbed up the top rope for a second elbow drop attempt and hit the Savage Elbow. He followed it up with a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] victory.<ref name=\"Fox\" /> He won the tournament and the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Hogan, Elizabeth and Savage celebrated Savage's WWF Championship win.<ref name=\"WrestleMania - Savage vs DiBiase\" /><ref name=\"wweresults\" /><ref name=\"powerdriver\" />\n\n==Reception==\n{{quote box|width=40%|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote= This show could have been so much better had they trimmed the tournament down to eight guys from fourteen.\n|source= \u2014Rob McNew of ''411Mania.com''<ref name=\"411mania\" />\n}}\n\nWrestleMania IV received mixed to poor reviews from critics. Most reviews criticized the show's length as well as the number of matches.\n<!-- Too Many Matches -->\nRob McNew from ''411Mania.com'' gave the show a 3.5/10 rating when reviewing the show, claiming the show was \"bad\".<ref name=\"411mania\" /> McNew was frustrated by the number of matches on the show, and the size of the tournament, saying \"This show could have been so much better had they trimmed the tournament down to eight guys from fourteen. Instead, we got a bunch of short matches, none of which ended up being memorable. The show had its moments and isn't all terrible. Just way too long. Savage-Dibiase provides a great moment, but the rest of the show is a pass.\"<ref name=\"411mania\" /> ''Retoprowrestling.com'' was also highly critical of the show's length, calling it \"a chore to watch\",<ref name=\"retroPW\" /> and that \"there's probably nothing wrong with a wrestling pay per view running nigh on four hours, but when about three and a half of those hours don't actually feature much in the way of entertainment, it often feels like you've spent your entire weekend just watching this one show.\"<ref name=\"retroPW\" />\n\nJohn Canton of ''TJR wrestling'' called the event \"a below-average show\", citing the event being \"a 16 match card. That\u2019s too many matches.\"<ref name=\"TJR\" /> Canton also commented on the length of these matches, and primary usage of \"rest holds\", and bad finishes.<ref name=\"TJR\" /> Bryan Rose from ''Voices of Wrestling'' called the show a \"dud\", before stating there was a \"lot of nothing for 3 1/2 hours.\" Rose also suggested similarities that the event's length had to watch two [[The Godfather (film series)|Godfather]] films.<ref name=\"uhSzA\" /> Mike Powell of ''prowrestling.net'' called the event \"really bad\", and commented that had the show been less than three hours in length, rather than 4, it would have been an allround better show.<ref name=\"fBzKy\" /> \n\n<!-- Positive Reviews -->\nHowever, John Powell, from ''SLAM! Wrestling'' called the event \"excellent\", saying that the show's greatness comes from its unpredictability.<ref name=\"slam_SLAM\" /> Powell,  says that the show was \"another tricky venture for Vince McMahon and he hits the jackpot again.\"<ref name=\"slam_SLAM\" /> Powell was very positive about the show's tournament, stating that it and Savage's title win was the highlights of the night.<ref name=\"slam_SLAM\" /> Bret Mix from ''Wrestling DVD Network'' commented on the structure of the event, before calling the event \"average\", but \"underrated\" for its high quality of matches throughout the show, despite the number of matches.<ref name=\"dURcL\" />\n\n<!-- Mania 5 -->\nAs an event in the annual [[WrestleMania]] series of events, WrestleMania IV is considered to be one of the weaker events; with reviews commenting that the event was most notable for a year-long feud between [[Randy Savage]] and [[Hulk Hogan]] that preceded the event, with the two facing off a year later at [[WrestleMania V]].<ref name=\"iAyOr\" /> Scott Keith of ''SmarK rant'' gave the event a \"recommendation to avoid\", and commented it was \"long, boring (and) dull\", and that the event was simply to \"serve as a prelude to WrestleMania V\"<ref name=\"BPF0B\" />\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn the months that followed the event, Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship on multiple occasions, primarily against DiBiase but also granted title shots to others such as the One Man Gang and Bad News Brown. Hogan, meanwhile, took a leave of absence from the WWF during the late spring and part of the summer to film the movie ''[[No Holds Barred (1989 film)|No Holds Barred]]''.<ref name=\"f4w savage\" /> Andr\u00e9 the Giant was shortly placed in a feud with \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan, however, the DiBiase-Andr\u00e9 alliance was renewed when the two attacked Savage during a television taping for the WWF's syndicated show ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]''. DiBiase and Andre would offer a tag team match to Savage at the [[SummerSlam (1988)|inaugural SummerSlam]], where Savage would choose to partner Hogan and create the \"[[The Mega Powers]]\".<ref name=\"B7wZj\" /><ref name=\"f4w savage\" /> The team of Hogan and Savage won the match before Savage would turn heel against Hogan at ''[[The Main Event II]]''.<ref name=\"QmVSe\" /> Hogan would challenge Savage for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania V]], with Hogan winning the title.<ref name=\"G3WIK\" />\n\nHaving interfered in Duggan's match at the event, Hacksaw confronted Andr\u00e9, and attacked him with his [[Dimensional lumber|2x4]]. This storyline would come to an end before ''Superstars of Wrestling''.<ref name=\"G3WIK\" /> Having wrestled to a time limit draw in the championship tournament, Jake Roberts and Rick Rude were placed into a feud regarding Rude making kayfabe advances over Robert's real-life wife, Cheryl.<ref name=\"twmwrestling\" /> The Honky Tonk Man continued to feud with Brutus Beefcake over the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship during the spring and summer of 1988, with Honky retaining the championship by being intentionally counted out or disqualified on multiple occasions. Beefcake was granted a \"final\" match at SummerSlam, but was sneak attacked by [[Ron Bass]] one week before the event. Honky would then lose his championship at Summerslam to a returning [[The Ultimate Warrior|Ultimate Warrior]].<ref name=\"twmwrestling\" />\n\nDemolition would defend the tag team championships against both Strike Force and The British Bulldogs. The Demolition-Strike Force feud came to an end in June 1988 when, during a televised match, Ax and Smash kayfabe injured Rick Martel by repeatedly using their finishing move, the \"Demolition Decapitation\" on him. Following this, The British Bulldogs and [[The Young Stallions]], and later another power team, [[The Powers of Pain]] ([[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]] and [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]]), became Demolition's primary challengers.<ref name=\"came_WWEW\" /> Following Bret Hart's elimination from the battle royal, he returned to the ring to challenge Bad News Brown.<ref name=\"xJxtZ\" /><ref name=\"13V3n\" /> Bret would see a face turn, alongside partner [[Jim Neidhart]]. The pair would also engage in a new feud with [[The Fabulous Rougeaus]].<ref name=\"pwh\" />\n\nWrestleMania IV was later released on [[VHS]], and would become the only WrestleMania event to be released over two VHS tapes.<ref name=\"pwpo_WRIT\" /><ref name=\"wres_WWET\" /> The event would later be released in 2014 on the [[WWE Network]].<ref name=\"dead_WWES\" />\n\n==Results==\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|results =<ref name=\"wweresults\" /><ref name=\"Jvysn\" /><ref name=\"pwin_THIS\" />\n|times   =<ref name=\"pwh\" />\n|match1  = [[Bad News Brown]] won by last eliminating [[Bret Hart]]{{efn|The other participants included were: [[Boris Zhukov]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Marsh|Danny Davis]], [[George Steele]], [[Harley Race]], [[Hillbilly Jim]], [[Jacques Rougeau]], [[Jim Brunzell]], [[Jim Neidhart]], [[Jim Powers]], [[Junkyard Dog]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Nikolai Volkoff]], [[Paul Roma]], [[Raymond Rougeau]], [[Ronald Herd|Ron Bass]], [[Michael Smith (wrestler)|Sam Houston]], and [[Sika Anoa'i|Sika]].<ref name=\"wweresults\" />}}\n|stip1   = [[Battle Royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]]\n|time1   = 9:44\n|match2  = [[Ted DiBiase]] (with [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] and [[Virgil (wrestler)|Virgil]]) defeated [[Jim Duggan]]\n|stip2   = First round tournament match\n|time2   = 5:02\n|match3  = [[Don Muraco]] (with [[Superstar Billy Graham]]) defeated [[Dino Bravo]] (with [[Frenchy Martin]]) by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]]\n|stip3   = First round tournament match\n|time3   = 4:53\n|match4  = [[Greg Valentine]] (with [[Jimmy Hart]]) defeated [[Ricky Steamboat]]\n|stip4   = First round tournament match\n|time4   = 9:12\n|match5  = [[Randy Savage]] (w/ [[Miss Elizabeth]]) defeated [[Butch Reed]] (with [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]])\n|stip5   = First round tournament match\n|time5   = 5:07\n|match6  = [[One Man Gang]] (with [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]]) defeated [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] (with [[Oliver Humperdink]]) by [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]]\n|stip6   = First round tournament match\n|time6   = 2:56\n|match7  = [[Jake Roberts]] vs. [[Rick Rude]] (with [[Bobby Heenan]]) ended in a time-limit draw\n|stip7   = First round tournament match\n|time7   = 15:00\n|match8  = [[The Ultimate Warrior]] defeated [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]] (with Bobby Heenan)\n|stip8   = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]\n|time8   = 4:29\n|match9  = [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] (with Ted DiBiase and Virgil) vs. [[Hulk Hogan]] ended in a double disqualification\n|stip9   = Quarter-final tournament match\n|time9   = 5:52\n|match10 = [[Ted DiBiase]] defeated [[Don Muraco]] (with [[Superstar Billy Graham]])\n|stip10  = Quarter-final tournament match\n|time10  = 5:44\n|match11 = [[Randy Savage]] (with [[Miss Elizabeth]]) defeated [[Greg Valentine]] (with [[Jimmy Hart]])\n|stip11  = Quarter-final tournament match\n|time11  = 6:06\n|match12 = [[Brutus Beefcake]] defeated [[The Honky Tonk Man]] (c) (with [[Jimmy Hart]] and [[Sherri Martel|Peggy Sue]]) by disqualification\n|stip12  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]] for the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]]\n|time12  = 6:30\n|match13 = [[The Islanders (professional wrestling)|The Islanders]] ([[Tonga Fifita|Haku]] and [[Sam Fatu|Tama]]) and Bobby Heenan defeated [[The British Bulldogs]] ([[Davey Boy Smith]] and [[Dynamite Kid]]) and [[Koko B.

Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

Here, two questions are discussed: 1) the generic affinities proposed for ''millegrana'', and 2) the valid name of the clade it belongs to, knowing that ''millegrana'' is the type species of the genus name ''Aporodoris'' von lhering 1886, by original designation. Bergh (1878a) re-allocated ''millegrana'' to ''Archidoris'' and then (Bergh 1894) to ''Thordisa'' with no explanation. Von lhering (1886) created a new generic name for ''millegrana'', ''Aporodoris''. The genus name ''Aporodoris'' was then used to describe several new species: ''Aporodoris rubra'' Bergh, 1905; ''Aporodoris risbeci'' Marcus and Marcus, 1967; and ''Aporodoris merria'' Burn, 1973. Thompson and Brown (1981) decided to re-allocate ''millegrana'' to ''Discodoris'' (Thompson classified all basal discodorids in ''Discodoris''). Then, more recently, Valdes and Gosliner (2001) rightly argued that ''Aporodoris'' von lhering, 1886, and ''Taringa'' Marcus, 1955, are two synonyms, and that ''millegrana'' belongs to ''Taringa'' species (as shown in the present phylogenetic analysis).</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The next question is: Which name should we use for that clade, ''Taringa'' or ''Aporodoris''? The older name, ''Aporodoris'', should have priority over the younger name, ''Taringa''. Valdes and Gosliner (2001) argued that in this case, however, the ICZN Article 23.9 (not 23.9.2) applies and that the younger name should be regarded as valid. However, Article 23.9 actually does not apply here. According to Article 23.9, prevailing usage can be maintained only if two conditions are met (described in 23.9.1), one of which (23.9.1.1) is that the senior synonym must not have been used as a valid name after 1899. Although Valdes and Gosliner (2001) thought that ''Aporodoris'' had not been used as a valid name since 1899, three new species names were created in ''Aporodoris'' since 1899 (see above), and several authors used the binomial ''Aporodoris millegrana'' as valid (Eliot 1910b; Pruvot-Fol 1954a; Bouchet and Tardy 1976). Therefore ''Aporodoris'' is a valid name, regardless of whether ''Taringa'' has been widely used or not.</blockquote>\n\nIn addition, but not noted by Dayrat, the combination ''Aporodoris millegrana'' was treated as the valid combination for this species between 1910 (Eliot, 1910b) and 1981 (Thompson and Brown, 1981) in listings of the British molluscan fauna (Winckworth, 1932;<ref>Winckworth, R. 1932.
