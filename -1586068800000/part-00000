It superseded the [[Imperial German Navy]] of the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918) and the inter-war ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (1919\u20131935) of the [[Weimar Republic]]. The ''Kriegsmarine'' was one of three official [[Military branch|branches]], along with the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|''Heer'']] and the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', the German armed forces from 1933 to 1945.\n\nIn violation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the ''Kriegsmarine'' grew rapidly during [[German rearmament|German naval rearmament]] in the 1930s. The 1919 treaty had limited the size of the German navy and prohibited the building of [[submarine]]s.<ref>http://net.lib.byu.edu/~rdh7/wwi/versa/versa4.html Act 159+, Act 181</ref>\n\n''Kriegsmarine'' ships were deployed to the waters around Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939) under the guise of enforcing non-intervention, but in reality supported the [[Francoist Spain|Nationalists]] against the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republicans]].\n\nIn January 1939, [[Plan Z]] was ordered, calling for surface naval parity with the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] by 1944. When [[World War II]] broke out in September 1939, Plan Z was shelved in favour of a crash building program for submarines ([[U-boat]]s) instead of capital surface warships and land and air forces were given priority of strategic resources.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief of the ''Kriegsmarine'' (as for all branches of armed forces during the period of absolute Nazi power) was [[Adolf Hitler]], who exercised his authority through the ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]''.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine''{{'}}s most significant ships were the U-boats, most of which were constructed after Plan Z was abandoned at the beginning of World War II. [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|Wolfpacks]] were rapidly assembled groups of submarines which attacked British convoys during the first half of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] but this tactic was largely abandoned by [[Black May (1943)|May 1943]] when U-boat losses mounted. Along with the U-boats, surface commerce raiders (including auxiliary cruisers) were used to disrupt Allied shipping in the early years of the war, the most famous of these being the heavy cruisers ''[[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|Admiral Graf Spee]]'' and ''[[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|Admiral Scheer]]'' and the battleship ''[[German battleship Bismarck|Bismarck]]''. However, the adoption of convoy escorts, especially in the Atlantic, greatly reduced the effectiveness of surface commerce raiders against convoys.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, the ''Kriegsmarine'''s remaining ships were divided up among the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] and were used for various purposes including [[Naval mine#Mine sweeping|minesweeping]].\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Post\u2013World War I origins===\nUnder the terms of the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]], Germany was only allowed a minimal navy of 15,000 personnel, six [[capital ships]] of no more than 10,000&nbsp;tons, six [[cruisers]], twelve [[destroyers]], twelve [[torpedo boats]] and no [[submarines]] or [[aircraft carrier]]s. Military aircraft were also banned, so Germany could have no [[naval aviation]]. Under the treaty Germany could only build new ships to replace old ones. All the ships allowed and personnel were taken over from the ''Kaiserliche Marine'', renamed the''[[Reichsmarine]]''.\n\nFrom the outset, Germany worked to circumvent the military restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. Through German-owned front companies, the Germans continued to develop U-boats through a submarine design office in the Netherlands ([[NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw|''NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw'']]) and a torpedo research program in Sweden where the [[G7e torpedo]] was developed.<ref>[http://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1599&context=etd Wolves Without Teeth: The German Torpedo Crisis in World War Two] p. 24</ref>\n\nEven before the [[Nazi seizure of power]] on 30 January 1933 the German government decided on 15 November 1932 to launch a prohibited naval re-armament program that included U-boats, airplanes and an aircraft carrier.\n\nThe launching of the first [[Deutschland-class cruiser|pocket battleship]], {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}} in 1931 (as a replacement for the old [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] ''[[SMS Preussen (1903)|Preussen]]'') was a step in the formation of a modern German fleet. The building of the ''Deutschland'' caused consternation among the French and the British as they had expected that the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles would limit the replacement of the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s to [[coastal defence ship]]s, suitable only for defensive warfare. By using innovative construction techniques, the Germans had built a heavy ship suitable for offensive warfare on the high seas while still abiding by the letter of the treaty.\n\n===Nazi control===\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, Adolf Hitler soon began to more brazenly ignore many of the Treaty restrictions and accelerated [[German re-armament|German naval rearmament]]. The [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 18 June 1935 allowed Germany to build a navy equivalent to 35% of the [[United Kingdom|British]] surface ship tonnage and 45% of British submarine tonnage; battleships were to be limited to no more than 35,000&nbsp;tons. That same year the ''Reichsmarine'' was renamed as the ''Kriegsmarine''. In April 1939, as tensions escalated between the United Kingdom and Germany over Poland, Hitler unilaterally rescinded the restrictions of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.\n\nThe building-up of the German fleet in the time period of 1935\u20131939 was slowed by problems with marshaling enough manpower and material for ship building. This was because of the simultaneous and rapid build-up of the German army and air force which demanded substantial effort and resources. Some projects, like the [[D-class cruiser (Germany)|D-class cruiser]]s and the [[P-class cruiser]]s, had to be cancelled.\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\n{{see also|German involvement in the Spanish Civil War#Maritime operations}}\nThe first military action of the ''Kriegsmarine'' came during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939). Following the outbreak of hostilities in July 1936 several large warships of the German fleet were sent to the region. The heavy cruisers {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}} and {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, and the light cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}} were the first to be sent in July 1936. These large ships were accompanied by the 2nd [[Torpedo-boat]] Flotilla. The German presence was used to covertly support [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] [[Spanish State|Nationalists]] although the immediate involvement of the ''{{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}}'' was humanitarian relief operations and evacuating 9,300 refugees, including 4,550 German citizens. Following the brokering of the [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|International Non-Intervention Patrol]] to enforce an international arms embargo the ''Kriegsmarine'' was allotted the patrol area between [[Cabo de Gata]] (Almeria) and [[Oropesa del Mar|Cabo de Oropesa]]. Numerous vessels served as part of these duties including {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}}. On 29 May 1937 the [[Deutschland incident (1937)|''Deutschland'' was attacked]] off [[Ibiza]] by two bombers from the [[Spanish Republican Air Force|Republican Air Force]]. Total casualties from the Republican attack were 31 dead and 110 wounded, 71 seriously, mostly burn victims. In retaliation the ''Admiral Scheer'' [[Bombardment of Almer\u00eda|shelled Almeria]] on 31 May killing 19\u201320 civilians, wounding 50 and destroying 35 buildings.<ref>Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. London. 2006. p.665</ref> Following further attacks by Republican submarines against the {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}} off the port of [[Oran]] between 15\u201318 June 1937 Germany withdrew from the Non-Intervention Patrol.\n\nU-boats also participated in covert action against Republican shipping as part of [[Operation Ursula]]. At least eight U-boats engaged a small number of targets in the area throughout the conflict. (By comparison the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' operated 58 submarines in the area as part of the ''Sottomarini Legionari''.)\n\n===Plan Z===\n{{Main|Plan Z}}\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' saw as her main tasks the controlling of the [[Baltic Sea]] and winning a war against [[France]] in connection with the German army, because France was seen as the most likely enemy in the event of war. But in 1938 Hitler wanted to have the possibility of winning a war against Great Britain at sea in the coming years. Therefore he ordered plans for such a fleet from the ''Kriegsmarine''. From the three proposed plans (X, Y and Z) he approved [[Plan Z]] in January 1939. This blueprint for the new German naval construction program envisaged building a navy of approximately 800 ships during the period 1939\u20131947. Hitler demanded that the program was to be completed by 1945. The main force of Plan Z were six [[H-class battleship proposals|H-class battleships]]. In the version of Plan Z drawn up in August 1939 the German fleet was planned to consist of the following ships by 1945:\n* 4 [[aircraft carriers]]\n* 10 [[battleships]]\n* 12 [[battlecruisers]]\n* 3 armored ships (''[[Panzerschiffe]]'')\n* 5 [[heavy cruiser]]s\n* 44 [[light cruiser]]s\n* 158 [[destroyers]] and [[torpedo boats]]\n* 249 [[submarines]]\n* Numerous smaller craft\nPersonnel strength was planned to rise to over 200,000.\n\nThe planned naval program was not very far advanced by the time [[World War II]] began. In 1939 two {{sclass2-|M|cruiser|1}}s and two [[H-class battleship proposals|H-class battleship]]s were laid down and parts for two further H-class battleships and three {{sclass2-|O|battlecruiser|1}}s were in production. The strength of the German fleet at the beginning of the war was not even 20% of Plan Z. On 1 September 1939, the navy still had a total personnel strength of only 78,000, and it was not at all ready for a major role in the war. Because of the long time it would take to get the Plan Z fleet ready for action and shortage in workers and material in wartime, Plan Z was essentially shelved in September 1939 and the resources allocated for its realization were largely redirected to the construction of [[U-boats]], which would be ready for war against the United Kingdom more quickly.\n<ref>Siegfried Breyer: ''Der Z-PLAN.''

In 1939, major events for the ''Kriegsmarine'' were the sinking of the British [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Courageous|50|6}} and the British [[battleship]] {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|6}} and the loss of the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}} at the [[Battle of the River Plate]]. Submarine attacks on Britain's vital maritime supply routes ([[Battle of the Atlantic]]) started immediately at the outbreak of war, although they were hampered by the lack of well placed ports from which to operate. Throughout the war the ''Kriegsmarine'' was responsible for [[coastal artillery]] protecting major ports and important coastal areas. It also operated anti-aircraft batteries protecting major ports.<ref name = \"Feldgrau38\">[http://www.feldgrau.com/articles.php?ID=38 Feldgrau :: Organization of the Kriegsmarine in the West 1940\u20131945]</ref>\n\nIn April 1940, the German Navy was heavily involved in the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|invasion of Norway]], where it suffered significant losses, which included the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Bl\u00fccher||2}} sunk by artillery and torpedoes from Norwegian shore batteries at the [[Oscarsborg Fortress]] in the [[Oslofjord]]. Ten destroyers were lost in the [[Battles of Narvik]] (half of German destroyer strength at the time), and two light cruisers, the ''[[German cruiser K\u00f6nigsberg|K\u00f6nigsberg]]'' which was bombed and sunk by Royal Navy aircraft in Bergen, and the ''[[German cruiser Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe]]'' which was sunk off the coast of Kristiansand by a British submarine. The ''Kriegsmarine'' did in return sink some British warships during this campaign, including the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Glorious}}.\n\nThe losses in the [[Norwegian Campaign]] left only a handful of undamaged heavy ships available for the planned, but never executed, invasion of the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Operation Sea Lion]]) in the summer of 1940. There were serious doubts that the invasion sea routes could have been protected against British naval interference. The [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] and the conquest of Norway gave German submarines greatly improved access to British shipping routes in the [[Atlantic]]. At first, British [[convoy]]s lacked escorts that were adequate either in numbers or equipment and, as a result, the submarines had much success for few losses (this period was dubbed the [[First Happy Time]] by the Germans).\n\n[[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] entered the war in June 1940, and the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]] began: from September 1941 to May 1944 some 62 German submarines were transferred there, sneaking past the British naval base at [[Gibraltar]]. The Mediterranean submarines sank 24 major Allied warships (including 12 destroyers, 4 cruisers, 2 aircraft carriers and 1 battleship) and 94 merchant ships (449,206&nbsp;tons of shipping). None of the Mediterranean submarines made it back to their home bases, as they were all either sunk in battle or scuttled by their crews at the end of the war<ref>[http://uboat.net/ops/med-ove.htm Uboat.net], U-boats in the Mediterranean \u2013 Overview</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-M2KBK-245-12, Frankreich, M-Boot im Hafen.jpg|thumb|The crew of a minesweeper, France, 1941]]\n\nIn 1941 one of the four modern German battleships, {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} sank {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} while breaking out into the Atlantic for commerce raiding. ''Bismarck'' was in turn hunted down by much superior British forces after being crippled by an air-launched torpedo. She was subsequently scuttled after being rendered a burning wreck by two British battleships.\n\nDuring 1941, the ''Kriegsmarine'' and the [[United States Navy]] became [[de facto]] [[belligerent]]s, although war was not formally declared, leading to the sinking of the {{USS|Reuben James|DD-245|6}}. This course of events were the result of the American decision to support Britain with its [[Lend-Lease]] program and the subsequent decision to escort Lend-Lease convoys with American war ships through the western part of the Atlantic.\n\nThe Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]] in December 1941 led to another phase of the Battle of the Atlantic. In [[Operation Drumbeat]] and subsequent operations until August 1942, a large number of Allied merchant ships were sunk by submarines off the American coast as the Americans had not prepared for submarine warfare, despite clear warnings (this was the so-called [[Second Happy Time]] for the German Navy). The situation became so serious that military leaders feared for the whole Allied strategy. The vast American ship building capabilities and naval forces were however now brought into the war and soon more than offset any losses inflicted by the German submariners. In 1942, the submarine warfare continued on all fronts, and when German forces in the Soviet Union reached the [[Black Sea]], a few submarines were eventually transferred there.\n\nIn February 1942, the three large warships stationed on the Atlantic coast at [[Brest, France|Brest]] were evacuated back to German ports for deployment to Norway. The ships had been repeatedly damaged by air attacks by the [[RAF]], the supply ships to support Atlantic sorties had been destroyed by the Royal Navy, and Hitler now felt that Norway was the \"zone of destiny\" for these ships. The two battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} passed through the English Channel ([[Channel Dash]]) on their way to Norway despite British efforts to stop them.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Garzke| first1 = William H.| last2 = Dulin| first2 = Robert O.| year = 1985| title = Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II| publisher = Naval Institute Press| location = Annapolis| isbn = 978-0-87021-101-0|pages=145\u2013146}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last1 = Koop| first1 = Gerhard| last2 = Schmolke| first2 = Klaus-Peter| year = 1999| title = Battleships of the Scharnhorst Class| publisher = Naval Institute Press| location = Annapolis| isbn = 978-1-55750-045-8|page=111}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Hellwinkel| first = Lars| year = 2014| title = Hitler's Gateway to the Atlantic: German Naval Bases in France 1940-1945| publisher = Seaforth Publishing| location = Barnsley|edition= Kindle, English Translation| isbn = 978-184832-199-1|page= Kindle location 731 of 4855 }}</ref> Not since the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 had any warships in wartime done this. It was a tactical victory for the ''Kriegsmarine'' and a blow to British morale, but the withdrawal removed the possibility of attacking allied convoys in the Atlantic with heavy surface ships.\n\nWith the German attack on the [[Soviet Union]] in June 1941 Britain started to send [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoy]]s with military goods around Norway to support their new ally. In 1942 German forces began heavily attacking these convoys, mostly with bombers and U-boats. The big ships of the ''Kriegsmarine'' in Norway were seldom involved in these attacks, because of the inferiority of German [[radar]] technology,<ref>{{cite web| last =Sieche| first =Erwin| title =German Naval Radar to 1945| publisher =Naval Weapons of the World| date =4 May 2007| url =http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_Radar.htm| accessdate = 23 December 2012}}</ref> and because Hitler and the leadership of the ''Kriegsmarine'' feared losses of these precious ships. The most effective of these attacks was the near destruction of [[Convoy PQ 17]] in July 1942. Later in the war German attacks on these convoys were mostly reduced to U-boat activities and the mass of the allied freighters reached their destination in Soviet ports.\n\nThe [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] in December 1942 was an attempt by a German naval surface force to attack an Allied [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoy]]. However, the advantage was not pressed home and they returned to base. There were serious implications: this failure infuriated Hitler, who nearly enforced a decision to scrap the surface fleet. Instead, resources were diverted to new U-boats, and the surface fleet became a lesser threat to the Allies.\n\n[[File:Tirpitz altafjord 2.jpg|thumb|Battleship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} in Norway, 1944]]\n\nAfter December 1943 when {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} had been sunk in an attack on an Arctic convoy in the [[Battle of North Cape]] by {{HMS|Duke of York|17|6}}, most German surface ships in bases at the Atlantic were blockaded in, or close to, their ports as a ''[[fleet in being]]'', for fear of losing them in action and to tie up British naval forces. The largest of these ships, the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}, was stationed in Norway as a threat to Allied shipping and also as a defence against a potential Allied invasion. When she was sunk, after several attempts, by British bombers in November 1944 ([[Operation Catechism]]), several British capital ships could be moved to the Far East.\n\nFrom late 1944 until the end of the war, the surviving surface fleet of the ''Kriegsmarine'' (heavy cruisers: {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, light cruisers: {{ship|German cruiser|N\u00fcrnberg||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}) was heavily engaged in providing artillery support to the retreating German land forces along the Baltic coast and in ferrying civilian refugees to the western [[Baltic Sea]] parts of Germany ([[Mecklenburg]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]]) in large rescue operations. Large parts of the population of [[historical eastern Germany|eastern Germany]] fled the approaching [[Red Army]] out of fear for Soviet retaliation (mass rapes, killings and looting by Soviet troops did occur). The ''Kriegsmarine'' evacuated two million civilians and troops in the [[evacuation of East Prussia]] and [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] from January to May 1945. It was during this activity that the catastrophic sinking of several large passenger ships occurred: {{MV|Wilhelm Gustloff||2}} and {{MV|Goya||2}} were sunk by Soviet submarines, while {{SS|Cap Arcona||2}} was sunk by British bombers, each sinking claiming thousands of civilian lives. The ''Kriegsmarine'' also provided important assistance in the evacuation of the fleeing German civilians of [[Pomerania]] and [[Stettin]] in March and April 1945.\n\nA desperate measure of the ''Kriegsmarine'' to fight the superior strength of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] from 1944 was the formation of the ''[[K-Verband|Kleinkampfverb\u00e4nde]]'' (Small Battle Units). These were special naval units with [[Frogman|frogmen]], manned torpedoes, motorboats laden with explosives and so on. The more effective of these weapons and units were the development and deployment of [[midget submarine]]s like the ''[[Molch]]'' and ''[[Seehund]]''. In the last stage of the war, the ''Kriegsmarine'' also organized a number of divisions of infantry from its personnel.<ref name = \"Feldgrau38\"/>\n\nBetween 1943 and 1945, a group of U-boats known as the [[Monsun Gruppe|''Monsun'' Boats]] (''Monsun Gruppe'') operated in the [[Indian Ocean]] from Japanese bases in the occupied [[Dutch East Indies]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. Allied convoys had not yet been organized in those waters, so initially many ships were sunk. However, this situation was soon remedied.<ref>[http://uboat.net/ops/monsun.htm Uboat.net], U-boat Operations \u2013 The Monsun U-boats</ref> During the later war years, the \"Monsun Boats\" were also used as a means of exchanging vital war supplies with Japan.\n\nDuring 1943 and 1944, due to Allied [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine tactics]] and better equipment the U-boat fleet started to suffer heavy losses. The turning point of the Battle of the Atlantic was during [[Black May (1943)|Black May]] in 1943, when the U-boat fleet started suffering heavy losses and the number of Allied ships sunk started to decrease. [[Radar]], longer range air cover, [[sonar]], improved tactics and new weapons all contributed. German technical developments, such as the [[Submarine snorkel|''Schnorchel'']], attempted to counter these. Near the end of the war a small number of the new ''[[Elektroboot]]'' U-boats ([[German Type XXI submarine|XXI]] and [[German Type XXIII submarine|XXIII]]) became operational, the first submarines designed to operate submerged at all times. The ''Elektroboote'' had the potential to negate the Allied technological and tactical advantage, although they were deployed too late to see combat in the war.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yD3eSRfUIesC&pg=PA39 Submarines: an illustrated history of their impact] Paul E.

The US used the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} in [[nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll]] in 1946 as target ship. Some (like the unfinished aircraft carrier {{ship|German aircraft carrier|Graf Zeppelin||2}}) were used for target practice with conventional weapons, while others (mostly destroyers and torpedo boats) were put into the service of Allied navies that lacked surface ships after the war. The training [[barque]] SSS ''Horst Wessel'' was recommissioned [[USCGC Eagle (WIX-327)|USCGC ''Eagle'']] and remains in active service, assigned to the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]].

In 1956, with West Germany's accession to [[NATO]], a new navy was established and was referred to as the ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' (Federal Navy). Some ''Kriegsmarine'' commanders like [[Erich Topp]] and [[Otto Kretschmer]] went on to serve in the ''Bundesmarine''. In [[East Germany]] the ''[[Volksmarine]]'' (People's Navy) was established in 1956.

This had been achieved by concealment but also by deliberately flouting World War I peace terms and those of various naval treaties. However, the war started with the German Navy still at a distinct disadvantage in terms of sheer size with what were expected to be its primary adversaries \u2013 the navies of France and Great Britain. Although a major re-armament of the navy ([[Plan Z]]) was planned, and initially begun, the start of the war in 1939 meant that the vast amounts of material required for the project were diverted to other areas. The sheer disparity in size when compared to the other European powers navies prompted German naval commander in chief Grand Admiral Erich Raeder to write of his own navy once the war began \"The surface forces can do no more than show that they know how to die gallantly.\" A number of captured ships from occupied countries were added to the German fleet as the war progressed.<ref>[http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/captured/index.html]</ref> Though six major units of the ''Kriegsmarine'' were sunk during the war (both ''Bismarck''-class battleships and both ''Scharnhorst''-class battleships, as well as two heavy cruisers), there were still many ships afloat (including four heavy cruisers and four light cruisers) as late as March 1945.\n\nSome ship types do not fit clearly into the commonly used ship classifications. Where there is argument, this has been noted.\n\n===Surface ships===\nThe main [[List of Kriegsmarine ships|combat ships of the ''Kriegsmarine'']] (excluding [[U-boat]]s):\n\n====Aircraft carriers====\nConstruction of the {{ship|German aircraft carrier|Graf Zeppelin||2}} was started in 1936 and construction of an [[Flugzeugtr\u00e4ger B|unnamed sister ship]] was started two years later in 1938, but neither ship was completed. In 1942 conversion of three German passenger ships ([[German aircraft carrier I (1942)|''Europa'']], [[Jade-class aircraft carrier|''Potsdam'', ''Gneisenau'']]) and two unfinished cruisers, the captured French light cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|De Grasse|C610|2}} and the German heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Seydlitz||2}}, to auxiliary carriers was begun. In November 1942 the conversion of the passenger ships was stopped because these ships were now seen as too slow for operations with the fleet. But conversion of one of these ships, the ''Potsdam'', to a training carrier was begun instead. In February 1943 all the work on carriers was halted because of the German failure during the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] which convinced Hitler that big warships were useless.\n\nAll engineering of the aircraft carriers like catapults, arresting gears and so on were tested and developed at the ''Erprobungsstelle See'' [[Travem\u00fcnde]] (Experimental Place Sea in Travem\u00fcnde) including the airplanes for the aircraft carriers, the [[Fieseler Fi 167]] ship-borne biplane torpedo and reconnaissance bomber and the navalized versions of two key early war ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft: the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]T fighter and [[Junkers Ju 87]]C ''Stuka'' dive bomber.\n\n====Battleships====\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' completed four battleships during its existence. The first pair were the 11-inch gun {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|4}}, consisting of the {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, which participated in the invasion of Norway ([[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|Operation ''Weser\u00fcbung'']]) in 1940, and then in commerce raiding until the ''Gneisenau'' was heavily damaged by a British air raid in 1942 and the ''Scharnhorst'' was sunk in the [[Battle of the North Cape]] in late 1943. The second pair were the 15-inch gun {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship|4}}, consisting of the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}. The ''Bismarck'' was sunk on her first sortie into the Atlantic in 1941 ([[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'']]) although she did sink the battlecruiser ''Hood'' and severely damaged the battleship ''Prince of Wales'', while the ''Tirpitz'' was based in Norwegian ports during most of the war as a [[fleet in being]], tying up Allied naval forces, and subject to a number of attacks by British aircraft and submarines. More battleships were planned (the [[H-class battleship proposals|H-class]]), but construction was abandoned in September 1939.\n\n====Pocket battleships (''Panzerschiffe'')====\nThe \"[[Pocket battleship]]s\" were the {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}} (renamed ''L\u00fctzow''), {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, and {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}}. Modern commentators favour classifying these as \"heavy cruisers\" and the ''Kriegsmarine'' itself reclassified these ships as such (''Schwere Kreuzer'') in 1940.<ref>[http://german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/ships/panzerschiffe/deutschland/history.html Deutschland History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In German language usage these three ships were designed and built as \"armoured ships\" (''Panzerschiffe'') \u2013 \"pocket battleship\" is an English label.\n\nThe ''Graf Spee'' was scuttled by her own crew in the [[Battle of the River Plate]], in the [[Rio de la Plata]] estuary in December 1939. ''Admiral Scheer'' was bombed on 9 April 1945 in port at Kiel and badly damaged, essentially beyond repair, and rolled over at her moorings. After the war that part of the harbor was filled in with rubble and the hulk buried. ''L\u00fctzow'' (ex-''Deutschland'') was bombed 16 April 1945 in the Baltic off Schwinem\u00fcnde just west of Stettin, and settled on the shallow bottom. With the Soviet Army advancing across the Oder, the ship was destroyed in place to prevent the Soviets capturing anything useful. The wreck was dismantled and scrapped in 1948\u20131949.<ref>E.

Plans to convert her into a radio-controlled target ship for aircraft was canceled because of the outbreak of war in 1939.\n\n====Battlecruisers====\nThree {{sclass2-|O|battlecruiser|1}}s were ordered in 1939, but with the start of the war the same year there were not enough resources to build the ships.\n\n====Heavy cruisers====\n{{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Bl\u00fccher||2}}, and {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}\n\nNever completed: {{ship|German cruiser|Seydlitz||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1939|2}}\n\n====Light cruisers====\n[[File:Konigsberg h80970.jpg|thumb|''K\u00f6nigsberg'' visiting Gdynia, Poland]]\nThe term \"[[light cruiser]]\" is a shortening of the phrase \"light [[armoured cruiser]]\". Light cruisers were defined under the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] by gun caliber. Light cruiser describes a small ship that was armoured in the same way as an armoured cruiser. In other words, like standard cruisers, light cruisers possessed a protective belt and a protective deck. Prior to this, smaller cruisers tended to be of the [[protected cruiser]] model and possessed only an armoured deck. The Kriegsmarine light cruisers were as follows:\n* {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}\n* {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6nigsberg||2}}\n* {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}}\n* {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}}\n* {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}}\n* {{ship|German cruiser|N\u00fcrnberg||2}}\n\nNever completed: three {{sclass2-|M|cruiser|1}}s\n\nNever Completed: KH-1 and KH-2 (Kreuzer (cruiser) Holland 1 and 2). Captured in the Netherlands 1940. Both being on the stocks and building continued for the ''Kriegsmarine''.\n\nIn addition, the former ''Kaiserliche Marine'' light cruiser {{SMS|Niobe||2}} was captured by Germans on 11 September 1943 after the capitulation of Italy. She was pressed into ''Kriegsmarine'' service for a brief time before being destroyed by British MTBs.\n\n====Auxiliary cruisers====\nDuring the war, some [[Armed merchantmen|merchant ships]] were converted into \"[[auxiliary cruiser]]s\" and nine were used as [[commerce raiders]] sailing under false flags to avoid detection, and operated in all oceans with considerable effect. The German designation for the ships was '''Handelst\u00f6rkreuzer''<nowiki/>' thus the HSK serial assigned. Each had as well an administrative label more commonly used, e.g. Schiff 16 = Atlantis, Schiff 41 = Kormoran, etc. The auxiliary cruisers were:\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Orion||2}} (HSK-1, Schiff 36)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Atlantis||2}} (HSK-2, Schiff 16)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Widder||2}} (HSK-3, Schiff 21)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Thor||2}} (HSK-4, Schiff 10)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Pinguin||2}} (HSK-5, Schiff 33)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Stier||2}} (HSK-6, Schiff 23)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Komet||2}} (HSK-7, Schiff 45)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Kormoran||2}} (HSK-8, Schiff 41)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Michel||2}} (HSK-9, Schiff 28)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Coronel||2}} (HSK number not assigned, Schiff 14, never active in raider operations.)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Hansa||2}} (HSK not assigned, Schiff 5, never active in raider operations, used as a training ship)<ref>E.

Early classes were unstable, wet in heavy weather, suffered from engine problems and had short range. Some problems were solved with the evolution of later designs, but further developments were curtailed by the war and, ultimately, by Germany's defeat. In the first year of World War II, they were used mainly to sow offensive minefields in shipping lanes close to the British coast.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n====Torpedo boats====\n[[File:Wolf-1.jpg|thumb|[[German torpedoboats of World War II|''Raubtier'']]-class torpedo boats]]\n\n{{Main|German torpedoboats of World War II}}\n\nThese vessels evolved through the 1930s from small vessels, relying almost entirely on torpedoes, to what were effectively small destroyers with mines, torpedoes and guns. Two classes of fleet torpedo boats were planned, but not built, in the 1940s.\n\n====E-boats (''Schnellboote'')====\n{{Main|E-boat}}\nThe E-boats were [[fast attack craft]] with [[torpedo tube]]s. Over 200 boats of this type were built for the ''Kriegsmarine''.\n\n====Troop ships====\n{{SS|Cap Arcona|1927|2}}, {{MV|Goya||2}}, {{SS|General von Steuben||2}}, {{MV|Monte Rosa||2}}, {{MV|Wilhelm Gustloff||2}}.\n\n====Miscellaneous====\nThousands of smaller warships and auxiliaries served in the ''Kriegsmarine'', including [[minelayers]], [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s, mine transports, netlayers, floating AA and torpedo batteries, command ships, decoy ships (small merchantmen with hidden weaponry), [[gunboats]], monitors, escorts, patrol boats, sub-chasers, landing craft, landing support ships, training ships, test ships, torpedo recovery boats, dispatch boats, aviso, fishery protection ships, survey ships, harbor defense boats, target ships and their radio control vessels, motor explosive boats, weather ships, tankers, colliers, tenders, supply ships, tugs, barges, icebreakers, hospital and accommodation ships, floating cranes and docks, and many others. The ''Kriegsmarine'' employed hundreds of auxiliary ''[[Vorpostenboot]]e'' during the war, mostly civilian ships that were drafted and fitted with military equipment, for use in coastal operations.\n\n===Submarines (U-boat)===\n{{Main|U-boat}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-3491-06, St. Nazaire, Uboot U 94, Karl D\u00f6nitz.jpg|thumb|[[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] inspecting the [[Saint-Nazaire submarine base]] in France, June 1941]]\nAt the outbreak of war, the ''Kriegsmarine'' had a relatively small fleet of 57 submarines ([[U-boat]]s).<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Ireland\n | first = Bernard\n | authorlink = Bernard Ireland\n | title = Battle of the Atlantic\n | publisher = Pen & Sword Books\n | year = 2003\n | location = Barnsley, UK\n | pages = 32\n | url = \n | doi = \n | isbn = 1-84415-001-1 }}</ref> This was increased steadily until mid-1943, when losses from Allied counter-measures matched the new vessels launched.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Ireland\n | first = Bernard\n | authorlink = Bernard Ireland\n | title = Battle of the Atlantic\n | publisher = Pen & Sword Books\n | year = 2003\n | location = Barnsley, UK\n | pages = 225\n | url = \n | doi = \n | isbn = 1-84415-001-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe principal types were the [[German Type IX submarine|Type IX]], a long range type used in the western and southern Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans; and the [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII]], the most numerous type, used principally in the north Atlantic. [[German Type X submarine|Type X]] was a small class of minelayers and [[German Type XIV submarine|Type XIV]] was a specialized type used to support distant U-boat operations \u2013 the \"''Milchkuh''\" (Milkcow).\n\nTypes [[German Type XXI submarine|XXI]] and [[German Type XXIII submarine|XXIII]], the \"''[[Elektroboot]]''\", would have negated much of the Allied anti-submarine tactics and technology, but only a few of this new type of U-boat became ready for combat at the end of the war. Post-war, they became the prototypes for modern submarines, in particular, the Soviet {{sclass2-|Whiskey|submarine|4}}.\n\nDuring World War II, about 60% of all U-boats commissioned were lost in action; 28,000 of the 40,000 U-boat crewmen were killed during the war and 8,000 were captured. The remaining U-boats were either surrendered to the Allies or scuttled by their own crews at the end of the war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uboat.net/fates/after-dl.htm|title=U-boats after World War Two - Fates - German U-boats of WWII - Kriegsmarine - uboat.net|website=uboat.net|language=en|access-date=2018-05-08}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Top 10 U-Boat aces in World War II\n|-\n| 274,333 tons (47 ships sunk) &nbsp; &nbsp; || [[Otto Kretschmer]]\n|-\n| 225,712 tons (43 ships) || [[Wolfgang L\u00fcth]]\n|-\n| 193,684 tons (34 ships) || [[Erich Topp]]\n|-\n| 186,064 tons (29 ships) || [[Karl-Friedrich Merten]]\n|-\n| 171,164 tons (34 ships) || [[Victor Sch\u00fctze]]\n|-\n| 171,122 tons (26 ships) || [[Herbert Schultze]]\n|-\n| 167,601 tons (28 ships) || [[Georg Lassen]]\n|-\n| 166,596 tons (22 ships) || [[Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock]]\n|-\n| 162,333 tons (30 ships) || [[Heinrich Liebe]]\n|-\n| 160,939 tons (28 ships), <br>plus the British battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|6}} inside [[Scapa Flow]] || [[G\u00fcnther Prien]]\n|}\n\n==Captured ships==\nThe military campaigns in Europe yielded a large number of captured vessels, many of which were under construction. Nations represented included Austria (riverine craft), Czechoslovakia (riverine craft), Poland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, United States (several landing craft) and Italy (after the armistice). Few of the incomplete ships of destroyer size or above were completed, but many smaller warships and auxiliaries were completed and commissioned into Kriegsmarine during the war. Additionally many captured or confisticated foreign civilian ships (merchantmen, fishing boats, tugboats etc.) were converted into auxiliary warships or support ships.\n\n==Major enemy warships sunk or destroyed==\nThe first warship sunk in World War II was the destroyer {{ORP|Wicher|1928|6}} of the [[Polish Navy]] by [[Junkers Ju 87]] [[dive bomber]]s of the carrier air group of aircraft carrier {{ship|German aircraft carrier|Graf Zeppelin||2}} on 3 September 1939.

His authority was exercised through the ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'', or OKM, with a Commander-in-Chief (''Oberbefehlshaber der Kriegsmarine''), a Chief of Naval General Staff (''Chef des Stabes der Seekriegsleitung'') and a Chief of Naval Operations (''Chef der Operationsabteilung'').<ref>{{cite web | last = Pipes | first = Jason | title = Organization of the Kriegsmarine | work = Feldgrau.com | date = 1996\u20132006 | url = http://www.feldgrau.com/kmsorg.html | accessdate = 2007-08-31 }}</ref> The first Commander-in-Chief of the OKM was [[Erich Raeder]] who was the Commander-in-Chief of the ''Reichsmarine'' when it was renamed and reorganized in 1935. Raeder held the post until falling out with Hitler after the German failure in the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]]. He was replaced by [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] on 30 January 1943 who held the command until he was appointed [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President of Germany]] upon Hitler's suicide in April 1945. [[Hans-Georg von Friedeburg]] was then Commander-in-Chief of the OKM for the short period of time until Germany surrendered in May 1945.\n\nSubordinate to these were regional, [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] and temporary [[flotilla]] commands. Regional commands covered significant naval regions and were themselves sub-divided, as necessary. They were commanded by a ''[[Generaladmiral]]'' or an [[Admiral (Germany)|Admiral]]. There was a ''Marineoberkommando'' for the Baltic Fleet, Nord, Nordsee, Norwegen, Ost/Ostsee (formerly Baltic), S\u00fcd and West. The ''Kriegsmarine'' used a form of encoding called ''[[Gradnetzmeldeverfahren]]'' to denote regions on a map.\n\nEach squadron (organized by type of ship) also had a command structure with its own [[Flag Officer]]. The commands were Battleships, Cruisers, Destroyers, Submarines (''[[F\u00fchrer der Unterseeboote]]''), Torpedo Boats, Minesweepers, Reconnaissance Forces, Naval Security Forces, Big Guns and Hand Guns, and Midget Weapons.\n\nMajor naval operations were commanded by a ''Flottenchef''. The ''Flottenchef'' controlled a flotilla and organized its actions during the operation. The commands were, by their nature, temporary.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'''s ship design bureau, known as the ''Marineamt'', was administered by officers with experience in sea duty but not in ship design, while the [[Naval architecture|naval architects]] who did the actual design work had only a theoretical understanding of design requirements. As a result the German surface fleet was plagued by design flaws throughout the war.<ref>{{cite web| last =Lienau| first =Peter| title =The Working Environment for German Warship design in WWI and WWII| publisher =Naval Weapons of the World| date =22 October 1999| url =http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-044.htm| accessdate = 23 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nCommunication was undertaken using an eight-rotor system of [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] encoding.\n\n===Air units===\nThe ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' had a near-complete monopoly on all German military aviation, including naval aviation, a major source of ongoing [[interservice rivalry]] with the ''Kriegsmarine''. Catapult-launched spotter planes like [[Arado Ar 196]] twin-float seaplanes were manned by the so-called ''Bordfliegergruppen'' (shipboard flying group).<ref>[http://www.feldgrau.com/BFGr196.htm Bordfliegergruppe 196]</ref> In addition, ''Tr\u00e4gergeschwader 186'' (Carrier Air [[Wing (air force unit)|Wing]] 186) operated two ''Gruppen'' (''Tr\u00e4gergruppe I/186'' and ''Tr\u00e4gergruppe II/186'')<ref>[http://www.feldgrau.com/TrGr186.htm Tr\u00e4gergruppe 186]</ref> equipped with navalized [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]T and [[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Ju 87C Stuka]]; these units were intended to serve aboard the aircraft carrier {{ship|German aircraft carrier|Graf Zeppelin||2}} which was never completed, yet provided the Kriegsmarine with some air-power from bases on land. Furthermore, five coastal groups (''K\u00fcstenfliegergruppen'') with [[reconnaissance aircraft]], [[torpedo bomber]]s, [[Minesweeper (ship)#Minesweeping aircraft|''Minensuch'' aerial minesweepers]] and [[air-sea rescue]] seaplanes supported the ''Kriegsmarine'', although with lesser resources as the war progressed.<ref>[http://www.wlb-stuttgart.de/seekrieg/lw/see.htm Luftwaffe naval-air units]</ref>\n\n===Coastal artillery, flak and radar units===\nThe [[coastal artillery|coastal batteries]] of the ''Kriegsmarine'' were stationed on the German coasts. With the conquering and occupation of other countries coastal artillery was stationed along the coasts of these countries, especially in France and Norway as part of the [[Atlantic Wall]].<ref name=\"P.

A reinforced [[platoon]] of the ''Marine Sto\u00dftrupp Kompanie'' landed with soldiers of the German Army from destroyers on 9 April 1940 in [[Narvik]]. In June 1940 the ''Marine Sto\u00dftrupp Abteilung'' (Marine Attack Troop Battalion) was flown in from France to the [[Channel Islands]] to occupy this British territory.\n\nIn September 1944 amphibious units unsuccessfully tried to capture the strategic island [[Gogland|Suursaari]] in the [[Gulf of Finland]] from Germany's former ally Finland ([[Operation Tanne Ost]]).\n\nWith the [[invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944 and the Soviet advance from the summer of 1944 the ''Kriegsmarine'' started to form [[regiment]]s and [[Division (military)|division]]s for the battles on land with superfluous personnel. With the loss of naval bases because of the Allied advance more and more navy personnel were available for the ground troops of the ''Kriegsmarine''. About 40 regiments were raised and from January 1945 on six divisions. Half of the regiments were absorbed by the divisions.<ref>J\u00f6rg Benz: ''Deutsche Marineinfanterie 1938\u20131945''.

It superseded the [[Imperial German Navy]] of the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918) and the inter-war ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' (1919\u20131935) of the [[Weimar Republic]]. The ''Kriegsmarine'' was one of three official [[Military branch|branches]], along with the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|''Heer'']] and the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', the German armed forces from 1933 to 1945.\n\nIn violation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the ''Kriegsmarine'' grew rapidly during [[German rearmament|German naval rearmament]] in the 1930s. The 1919 treaty had limited the size of the German navy and prohibited the building of [[submarine]]s.<ref>http://net.lib.byu.edu/~rdh7/wwi/versa/versa4.html Act 159+, Act 181</ref>\n\n''Kriegsmarine'' ships were deployed to the waters around Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939) under the guise of enforcing non-intervention, but in reality supported the [[Francoist Spain|Nationalists]] against the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republicans]].\n\nIn January 1939, [[Plan Z]] was ordered, calling for surface naval parity with the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] by 1944. When [[World War II]] broke out in September 1939, Plan Z was shelved in favour of a crash building program for submarines ([[U-boat]]s) instead of capital surface warships and land and air forces were given priority of strategic resources.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief of the ''Kriegsmarine'' (as for all branches of armed forces during the period of absolute Nazi power) was [[Adolf Hitler]], who exercised his authority through the ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]''.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine''{{'}}s most significant ships were the U-boats, most of which were constructed after Plan Z was abandoned at the beginning of World War II. [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|Wolfpacks]] were rapidly assembled groups of submarines which attacked British convoys during the first half of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] but this tactic was largely abandoned by [[Black May (1943)|May 1943]] when U-boat losses mounted. Along with the U-boats, surface commerce raiders (including auxiliary cruisers) were used to disrupt Allied shipping in the early years of the war, the most famous of these being the heavy cruisers ''[[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|Admiral Graf Spee]]'' and ''[[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|Admiral Scheer]]'' and the battleship ''[[German battleship Bismarck|Bismarck]]''. However, the adoption of convoy escorts, especially in the Atlantic, greatly reduced the effectiveness of surface commerce raiders against convoys.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, the ''Kriegsmarine'''s remaining ships were divided up among the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] and were used for various purposes including [[Naval mine#Mine sweeping|minesweeping]].\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Post\u2013World War I origins===\nUnder the terms of the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]], Germany was only allowed a minimal navy of 15,000 personnel, six [[capital ships]] of no more than 10,000&nbsp;tons, six [[cruisers]], twelve [[destroyers]], twelve [[torpedo boats]] and no [[submarines]] or [[aircraft carrier]]s. Military aircraft were also banned, so Germany could have no [[naval aviation]]. Under the treaty Germany could only build new ships to replace old ones. All the ships allowed and personnel were taken over from the ''Kaiserliche Marine'', renamed the''[[Reichsmarine]]''.\n\nFrom the outset, Germany worked to circumvent the military restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. Through German-owned front companies, the Germans continued to develop U-boats through a submarine design office in the Netherlands ([[NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw|''NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw'']]) and a torpedo research program in Sweden where the [[G7e torpedo]] was developed.<ref>[http://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1599&context=etd Wolves Without Teeth: The German Torpedo Crisis in World War Two] p. 24</ref>\n\nEven before the [[Nazi seizure of power]] on 30 January 1933 the German government decided on 15 November 1932 to launch a prohibited naval re-armament program that included U-boats, airplanes and an aircraft carrier.\n\nThe launching of the first [[Deutschland-class cruiser|pocket battleship]], {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}} in 1931 (as a replacement for the old [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] ''[[SMS Preussen (1903)|Preussen]]'') was a step in the formation of a modern German fleet. The building of the ''Deutschland'' caused consternation among the French and the British as they had expected that the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles would limit the replacement of the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s to [[coastal defence ship]]s, suitable only for defensive warfare. By using innovative construction techniques, the Germans had built a heavy ship suitable for offensive warfare on the high seas while still abiding by the letter of the treaty.\n\n===Nazi control===\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, Adolf Hitler soon began to more brazenly ignore many of the Treaty restrictions and accelerated [[German re-armament|German naval rearmament]]. The [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 18 June 1935 allowed Germany to build a navy equivalent to 35% of the [[United Kingdom|British]] surface ship tonnage and 45% of British submarine tonnage; battleships were to be limited to no more than 35,000&nbsp;tons. That same year the ''Reichsmarine'' was renamed as the ''Kriegsmarine''. In April 1939, as tensions escalated between the United Kingdom and Germany over Poland, Hitler unilaterally rescinded the restrictions of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.\n\nThe building-up of the German fleet in the time period of 1935\u20131939 was slowed by problems with marshaling enough manpower and material for ship building. This was because of the simultaneous and rapid build-up of the German army and air force which demanded substantial effort and resources. Some projects, like the [[D-class cruiser (Germany)|D-class cruiser]]s and the [[P-class cruiser]]s, had to be cancelled.\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\n{{see also|German involvement in the Spanish Civil War#Maritime operations}}\nThe first military action of the ''Kriegsmarine'' came during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939). Following the outbreak of hostilities in July 1936 several large warships of the German fleet were sent to the region. The heavy cruisers {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}} and {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, and the light cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}} were the first to be sent in July 1936. These large ships were accompanied by the 2nd [[Torpedo-boat]] Flotilla. The German presence was used to covertly support [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] [[Spanish State|Nationalists]] although the immediate involvement of the ''{{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}}'' was humanitarian relief operations and evacuating 9,300 refugees, including 4,550 German citizens. Following the brokering of the [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|International Non-Intervention Patrol]] to enforce an international arms embargo the ''Kriegsmarine'' was allotted the patrol area between [[Cabo de Gata]] (Almeria) and [[Oropesa del Mar|Cabo de Oropesa]]. Numerous vessels served as part of these duties including {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}}. On 29 May 1937 the [[Deutschland incident (1937)|''Deutschland'' was attacked]] off [[Ibiza]] by two bombers from the [[Spanish Republican Air Force|Republican Air Force]]. Total casualties from the Republican attack were 31 dead and 110 wounded, 71 seriously, mostly burn victims. In retaliation the ''Admiral Scheer'' [[Bombardment of Almer\u00eda|shelled Almeria]] on 31 May killing 19\u201320 civilians, wounding 50 and destroying 35 buildings.<ref>Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. London. 2006. p.665</ref> Following further attacks by Republican submarines against the {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}} off the port of [[Oran]] between 15\u201318 June 1937 Germany withdrew from the Non-Intervention Patrol.\n\nU-boats also participated in covert action against Republican shipping as part of [[Operation Ursula]]. At least eight U-boats engaged a small number of targets in the area throughout the conflict. (By comparison the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' operated 58 submarines in the area as part of the ''Sottomarini Legionari''.)\n\n===Plan Z===\n{{Main|Plan Z}}\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' saw as her main tasks the controlling of the [[Baltic Sea]] and winning a war against [[France]] in connection with the German army, because France was seen as the most likely enemy in the event of war. But in 1938 Hitler wanted to have the possibility of winning a war against Great Britain at sea in the coming years. Therefore he ordered plans for such a fleet from the ''Kriegsmarine''. From the three proposed plans (X, Y and Z) he approved [[Plan Z]] in January 1939. This blueprint for the new German naval construction program envisaged building a navy of approximately 800 ships during the period 1939\u20131947. Hitler demanded that the program was to be completed by 1945. The main force of Plan Z were six [[H-class battleship proposals|H-class battleships]]. In the version of Plan Z drawn up in August 1939 the German fleet was planned to consist of the following ships by 1945:\n* 4 [[aircraft carriers]]\n* 10 [[battleships]]\n* 12 [[battlecruisers]]\n* 3 armored ships (''[[Panzerschiffe]]'')\n* 5 [[heavy cruiser]]s\n* 44 [[light cruiser]]s\n* 158 [[destroyers]] and [[torpedo boats]]\n* 249 [[submarines]]\n* Numerous smaller craft\nPersonnel strength was planned to rise to over 200,000.\n\nThe planned naval program was not very far advanced by the time [[World War II]] began. In 1939 two {{sclass2-|M|cruiser|1}}s and two [[H-class battleship proposals|H-class battleship]]s were laid down and parts for two further H-class battleships and three {{sclass2-|O|battlecruiser|1}}s were in production. The strength of the German fleet at the beginning of the war was not even 20% of Plan Z. On 1 September 1939, the navy still had a total personnel strength of only 78,000, and it was not at all ready for a major role in the war. Because of the long time it would take to get the Plan Z fleet ready for action and shortage in workers and material in wartime, Plan Z was essentially shelved in September 1939 and the resources allocated for its realization were largely redirected to the construction of [[U-boats]], which would be ready for war against the United Kingdom more quickly.\n<ref>Siegfried Breyer: ''Der Z-PLAN.''

In 1939, major events for the ''Kriegsmarine'' were the sinking of the British [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Courageous|50|6}} and the British [[battleship]] {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|6}} and the loss of the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}} at the [[Battle of the River Plate]]. Submarine attacks on Britain's vital maritime supply routes ([[Battle of the Atlantic]]) started immediately at the outbreak of war, although they were hampered by the lack of well placed ports from which to operate. Throughout the war the ''Kriegsmarine'' was responsible for [[coastal artillery]] protecting major ports and important coastal areas. It also operated anti-aircraft batteries protecting major ports.<ref name = \"Feldgrau38\">[http://www.feldgrau.com/articles.php?ID=38 Feldgrau :: Organization of the Kriegsmarine in the West 1940\u20131945]</ref>\n\nIn April 1940, the German Navy was heavily involved in the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|invasion of Norway]], where it suffered significant losses, which included the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Bl\u00fccher||2}} sunk by artillery and torpedoes from Norwegian shore batteries at the [[Oscarsborg Fortress]] in the [[Oslofjord]]. Ten destroyers were lost in the [[Battles of Narvik]] (half of German destroyer strength at the time), and two light cruisers, the ''[[German cruiser K\u00f6nigsberg|K\u00f6nigsberg]]'' which was bombed and sunk by Royal Navy aircraft in Bergen, and the ''[[German cruiser Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe]]'' which was sunk off the coast of Kristiansand by a British submarine. The ''Kriegsmarine'' did in return sink some British warships during this campaign, including the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Glorious}}.\n\nThe losses in the [[Norwegian Campaign]] left only a handful of undamaged heavy ships available for the planned, but never executed, invasion of the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Operation Sea Lion]]) in the summer of 1940. There were serious doubts that the invasion sea routes could have been protected against British naval interference. The [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] and the conquest of Norway gave German submarines greatly improved access to British shipping routes in the [[Atlantic]]. At first, British [[convoy]]s lacked escorts that were adequate either in numbers or equipment and, as a result, the submarines had much success for few losses (this period was dubbed the [[First Happy Time]] by the Germans).\n\n[[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] entered the war in June 1940, and the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]] began: from September 1941 to May 1944 some 62 German submarines were transferred there, sneaking past the British naval base at [[Gibraltar]]. The Mediterranean submarines sank 24 major Allied warships (including 12 destroyers, 4 cruisers, 2 aircraft carriers and 1 battleship) and 94 merchant ships (449,206&nbsp;tons of shipping). None of the Mediterranean submarines made it back to their home bases, as they were all either sunk in battle or scuttled by their crews at the end of the war<ref>[http://uboat.net/ops/med-ove.htm Uboat.net], U-boats in the Mediterranean \u2013 Overview</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-M2KBK-245-12, Frankreich, M-Boot im Hafen.jpg|thumb|The crew of a minesweeper, France, 1941]]\n\nIn 1941 one of the four modern German battleships, {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} sank {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} while breaking out into the Atlantic for commerce raiding. ''Bismarck'' was in turn hunted down by much superior British forces after being crippled by an air-launched torpedo. She was subsequently scuttled after being rendered a burning wreck by two British battleships.\n\nDuring 1941, the ''Kriegsmarine'' and the [[United States Navy]] became [[de facto]] [[belligerent]]s, although war was not formally declared, leading to the sinking of the {{USS|Reuben James|DD-245|6}}. This course of events were the result of the American decision to support Britain with its [[Lend-Lease]] program and the subsequent decision to escort Lend-Lease convoys with American war ships through the western part of the Atlantic.\n\nThe Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]] in December 1941 led to another phase of the Battle of the Atlantic. In [[Operation Drumbeat]] and subsequent operations until August 1942, a large number of Allied merchant ships were sunk by submarines off the American coast as the Americans had not prepared for submarine warfare, despite clear warnings (this was the so-called [[Second Happy Time]] for the German Navy). The situation became so serious that military leaders feared for the whole Allied strategy. The vast American ship building capabilities and naval forces were however now brought into the war and soon more than offset any losses inflicted by the German submariners. In 1942, the submarine warfare continued on all fronts, and when German forces in the Soviet Union reached the [[Black Sea]], a few submarines were eventually transferred there.\n\nIn February 1942, the three large warships stationed on the Atlantic coast at [[Brest, France|Brest]] were evacuated back to German ports for deployment to Norway. The ships had been repeatedly damaged by air attacks by the [[RAF]], the supply ships to support Atlantic sorties had been destroyed by the Royal Navy, and Hitler now felt that Norway was the \"zone of destiny\" for these ships. The two battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} passed through the English Channel ([[Channel Dash]]) on their way to Norway despite British efforts to stop them.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Garzke| first1 = William H.| last2 = Dulin| first2 = Robert O.| year = 1985| title = Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II| publisher = Naval Institute Press| location = Annapolis| isbn = 978-0-87021-101-0|pages=145\u2013146}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last1 = Koop| first1 = Gerhard| last2 = Schmolke| first2 = Klaus-Peter| year = 1999| title = Battleships of the Scharnhorst Class| publisher = Naval Institute Press| location = Annapolis| isbn = 978-1-55750-045-8|page=111}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Hellwinkel| first = Lars| year = 2014| title = Hitler's Gateway to the Atlantic: German Naval Bases in France 1940-1945| publisher = Seaforth Publishing| location = Barnsley|edition= Kindle, English Translation| isbn = 978-184832-199-1|page= Kindle location 731 of 4855 }}</ref> Not since the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 had any warships in wartime done this. It was a tactical victory for the ''Kriegsmarine'' and a blow to British morale, but the withdrawal removed the possibility of attacking allied convoys in the Atlantic with heavy surface ships.\n\nWith the German attack on the [[Soviet Union]] in June 1941 Britain started to send [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoy]]s with military goods around Norway to support their new ally. In 1942 German forces began heavily attacking these convoys, mostly with bombers and U-boats. The big ships of the ''Kriegsmarine'' in Norway were seldom involved in these attacks, because of the inferiority of German [[radar]] technology,<ref>{{cite web| last =Sieche| first =Erwin| title =German Naval Radar to 1945| publisher =Naval Weapons of the World| date =4 May 2007| url =http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_Radar.htm| accessdate = 23 December 2012}}</ref> and because Hitler and the leadership of the ''Kriegsmarine'' feared losses of these precious ships. The most effective of these attacks was the near destruction of [[Convoy PQ 17]] in July 1942. Later in the war German attacks on these convoys were mostly reduced to U-boat activities and the mass of the allied freighters reached their destination in Soviet ports.\n\nThe [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] in December 1942 was an attempt by a German naval surface force to attack an Allied [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoy]]. However, the advantage was not pressed home and they returned to base. There were serious implications: this failure infuriated Hitler, who nearly enforced a decision to scrap the surface fleet. Instead, resources were diverted to new U-boats, and the surface fleet became a lesser threat to the Allies.\n\n[[File:Tirpitz altafjord 2.jpg|thumb|Battleship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} in Norway, 1944]]\n\nAfter December 1943 when {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} had been sunk in an attack on an Arctic convoy in the [[Battle of North Cape]] by {{HMS|Duke of York|17|6}}, most German surface ships in bases at the Atlantic were blockaded in, or close to, their ports as a ''[[fleet in being]]'', for fear of losing them in action and to tie up British naval forces. The largest of these ships, the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}, was stationed in Norway as a threat to Allied shipping and also as a defence against a potential Allied invasion. When she was sunk, after several attempts, by British bombers in November 1944 ([[Operation Catechism]]), several British capital ships could be moved to the Far East.\n\nFrom late 1944 until the end of the war, the surviving surface fleet of the ''Kriegsmarine'' (heavy cruisers: {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, light cruisers: {{ship|German cruiser|N\u00fcrnberg||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}) was heavily engaged in providing artillery support to the retreating German land forces along the Baltic coast and in ferrying civilian refugees to the western [[Baltic Sea]] parts of Germany ([[Mecklenburg]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]]) in large rescue operations. Large parts of the population of [[historical eastern Germany|eastern Germany]] fled the approaching [[Red Army]] out of fear for Soviet retaliation (mass rapes, killings and looting by Soviet troops did occur). The ''Kriegsmarine'' evacuated two million civilians and troops in the [[evacuation of East Prussia]] and [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] from January to May 1945. It was during this activity that the catastrophic sinking of several large passenger ships occurred: {{MV|Wilhelm Gustloff||2}} and {{MV|Goya||2}} were sunk by Soviet submarines, while {{SS|Cap Arcona||2}} was sunk by British bombers, each sinking claiming thousands of civilian lives. The ''Kriegsmarine'' also provided important assistance in the evacuation of the fleeing German civilians of [[Pomerania]] and [[Stettin]] in March and April 1945.\n\nA desperate measure of the ''Kriegsmarine'' to fight the superior strength of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] from 1944 was the formation of the ''[[K-Verband|Kleinkampfverb\u00e4nde]]'' (Small Battle Units). These were special naval units with [[Frogman|frogmen]], manned torpedoes, motorboats laden with explosives and so on. The more effective of these weapons and units were the development and deployment of [[midget submarine]]s like the ''[[Molch]]'' and ''[[Seehund]]''. In the last stage of the war, the ''Kriegsmarine'' also organized a number of divisions of infantry from its personnel.<ref name = \"Feldgrau38\"/>\n\nBetween 1943 and 1945, a group of U-boats known as the [[Monsun Gruppe|''Monsun'' Boats]] (''Monsun Gruppe'') operated in the [[Indian Ocean]] from Japanese bases in the occupied [[Dutch East Indies]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. Allied convoys had not yet been organized in those waters, so initially many ships were sunk. However, this situation was soon remedied.<ref>[http://uboat.net/ops/monsun.htm Uboat.net], U-boat Operations \u2013 The Monsun U-boats</ref> During the later war years, the \"Monsun Boats\" were also used as a means of exchanging vital war supplies with Japan.\n\nDuring 1943 and 1944, due to Allied [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine tactics]] and better equipment the U-boat fleet started to suffer heavy losses. The turning point of the Battle of the Atlantic was during [[Black May (1943)|Black May]] in 1943, when the U-boat fleet started suffering heavy losses and the number of Allied ships sunk started to decrease. [[Radar]], longer range air cover, [[sonar]], improved tactics and new weapons all contributed. German technical developments, such as the [[Submarine snorkel|''Schnorchel'']], attempted to counter these. Near the end of the war a small number of the new ''[[Elektroboot]]'' U-boats ([[German Type XXI submarine|XXI]] and [[German Type XXIII submarine|XXIII]]) became operational, the first submarines designed to operate submerged at all times. The ''Elektroboote'' had the potential to negate the Allied technological and tactical advantage, although they were deployed too late to see combat in the war.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yD3eSRfUIesC&pg=PA39 Submarines: an illustrated history of their impact] Paul E.

The US used the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} in [[nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll]] in 1946 as target ship. Some (like the unfinished aircraft carrier {{ship|German aircraft carrier|Graf Zeppelin||2}}) were used for target practice with conventional weapons, while others (mostly destroyers and torpedo boats) were put into the service of Allied navies that lacked surface ships after the war. The training [[barque]] SSS ''Horst Wessel'' was recommissioned [[USCGC Eagle (WIX-327)|USCGC ''Eagle'']] and remains in active service, assigned to the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]].

In 1956, with West Germany's accession to [[NATO]], a new navy was established and was referred to as the ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' (Federal Navy). Some ''Kriegsmarine'' commanders like [[Erich Topp]] and [[Otto Kretschmer]] went on to serve in the ''Bundesmarine''. In [[East Germany]] the ''[[Volksmarine]]'' (People's Navy) was established in 1956.

This had been achieved by concealment but also by deliberately flouting World War I peace terms and those of various naval treaties. However, the war started with the German Navy still at a distinct disadvantage in terms of sheer size with what were expected to be its primary adversaries \u2013 the navies of France and Great Britain. Although a major re-armament of the navy ([[Plan Z]]) was planned, and initially begun, the start of the war in 1939 meant that the vast amounts of material required for the project were diverted to other areas. The sheer disparity in size when compared to the other European powers navies prompted German naval commander in chief Grand Admiral Erich Raeder to write of his own navy once the war began \"The surface forces can do no more than show that they know how to die gallantly.\" A number of captured ships from occupied countries were added to the German fleet as the war progressed.<ref>[http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/captured/index.html]</ref> Though six major units of the ''Kriegsmarine'' were sunk during the war (both ''Bismarck''-class battleships and both ''Scharnhorst''-class battleships, as well as two heavy cruisers), there were still many ships afloat (including four heavy cruisers and four light cruisers) as late as March 1945.\n\nSome ship types do not fit clearly into the commonly used ship classifications. Where there is argument, this has been noted.\n\n===Surface ships===\nThe main [[List of Kriegsmarine ships|combat ships of the ''Kriegsmarine'']] (excluding [[U-boat]]s):\n\n====Aircraft carriers====\nConstruction of the {{ship|German aircraft carrier|Graf Zeppelin||2}} was started in 1936 and construction of an [[Flugzeugtr\u00e4ger B|unnamed sister ship]] was started two years later in 1938, but neither ship was completed. In 1942 conversion of three German passenger ships ([[German aircraft carrier I (1942)|''Europa'']], [[Jade-class aircraft carrier|''Potsdam'', ''Gneisenau'']]) and two unfinished cruisers, the captured French light cruiser {{ship|French cruiser|De Grasse|C610|2}} and the German heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Seydlitz||2}}, to auxiliary carriers was begun. In November 1942 the conversion of the passenger ships was stopped because these ships were now seen as too slow for operations with the fleet. But conversion of one of these ships, the ''Potsdam'', to a training carrier was begun instead. In February 1943 all the work on carriers was halted because of the German failure during the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] which convinced Hitler that big warships were useless.\n\nAll engineering of the aircraft carriers like catapults, arresting gears and so on were tested and developed at the ''Erprobungsstelle See'' [[Travem\u00fcnde]] (Experimental Place Sea in Travem\u00fcnde) including the airplanes for the aircraft carriers, the [[Fieseler Fi 167]] ship-borne biplane torpedo and reconnaissance bomber and the navalized versions of two key early war ''Luftwaffe'' aircraft: the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]T fighter and [[Junkers Ju 87]]C ''Stuka'' dive bomber.\n\n====Battleships====\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' completed four battleships during its existence. The first pair were the 11-inch gun {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|4}}, consisting of the {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, which participated in the invasion of Norway ([[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|Operation ''Weser\u00fcbung'']]) in 1940, and then in commerce raiding until the ''Gneisenau'' was heavily damaged by a British air raid in 1942 and the ''Scharnhorst'' was sunk in the [[Battle of the North Cape]] in late 1943. The second pair were the 15-inch gun {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship|4}}, consisting of the {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}. The ''Bismarck'' was sunk on her first sortie into the Atlantic in 1941 ([[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'']]) although she did sink the battlecruiser ''Hood'' and severely damage the battleship ''Prince of Wales'', while the ''Tirpitz'' was based in Norwegian ports during most of the war as a [[fleet in being]], tying up Allied naval forces, and subject to a number of attacks by British aircraft and submarines. More battleships were planned (the [[H-class battleship proposals|H-class]]), but construction was abandoned in September 1939.\n\n====Pocket battleships (''Panzerschiffe'')====\nThe \"[[Pocket battleship]]s\" were the {{ship|German cruiser|Deutschland||2}} (renamed ''L\u00fctzow''), {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, and {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}}. Modern commentators favour classifying these as \"heavy cruisers\" and the ''Kriegsmarine'' itself reclassified these ships as such (''Schwere Kreuzer'') in 1940.<ref>[http://german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/ships/panzerschiffe/deutschland/history.html Deutschland History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In German language usage these three ships were designed and built as \"armoured ships\" (''Panzerschiffe'') \u2013 \"pocket battleship\" is an English label.\n\nThe ''Graf Spee'' was scuttled by her own crew in the [[Battle of the River Plate]], in the [[Rio de la Plata]] estuary in December 1939. ''Admiral Scheer'' was bombed on 9 April 1945 in port at Kiel and badly damaged, essentially beyond repair, and rolled over at her moorings. After the war that part of the harbor was filled in with rubble and the hulk buried. ''L\u00fctzow'' (ex-''Deutschland'') was bombed 16 April 1945 in the Baltic off Schwinem\u00fcnde just west of Stettin, and settled on the shallow bottom. With the Soviet Army advancing across the Oder, the ship was destroyed in place to prevent the Soviets capturing anything useful. The wreck was dismantled and scrapped in 1948\u20131949.<ref>E.

Plans to convert her into a radio-controlled target ship for aircraft was canceled because of the outbreak of war in 1939.\n\n====Battlecruisers====\nThree {{sclass2-|O|battlecruiser|1}}s were ordered in 1939, but with the start of the war the same year there were not enough resources to build the ships.\n\n====Heavy cruisers====\n{{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Bl\u00fccher||2}}, and {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}\n\nNever completed: {{ship|German cruiser|Seydlitz||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1939|2}}\n\n====Light cruisers====\n[[File:Konigsberg h80970.jpg|thumb|''K\u00f6nigsberg'' visiting Gdynia, Poland]]\nThe term \"[[light cruiser]]\" is a shortening of the phrase \"light [[armoured cruiser]]\". Light cruisers were defined under the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] by gun caliber. Light cruiser describes a small ship that was armoured in the same way as an armoured cruiser. In other words, like standard cruisers, light cruisers possessed a protective belt and a protective deck. Prior to this, smaller cruisers tended to be of the [[protected cruiser]] model and possessed only an armoured deck. The Kriegsmarine light cruisers were as follows:\n* {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}\n* {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6nigsberg||2}}\n* {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}}\n* {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}}\n* {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}}\n* {{ship|German cruiser|N\u00fcrnberg||2}}\n\nNever completed: three {{sclass2-|M|cruiser|1}}s\n\nNever Completed: KH-1 and KH-2 (Kreuzer (cruiser) Holland 1 and 2). Captured in the Netherlands 1940. Both being on the stocks and building continued for the ''Kriegsmarine''.\n\nIn addition, the former ''Kaiserliche Marine'' light cruiser {{SMS|Niobe||2}} was captured by Germans on 11 September 1943 after the capitulation of Italy. She was pressed into ''Kriegsmarine'' service for a brief time before being destroyed by British MTBs.\n\n====Auxiliary cruisers====\nDuring the war, some [[Armed merchantmen|merchant ships]] were converted into \"[[auxiliary cruiser]]s\" and nine were used as [[commerce raiders]] sailing under false flags to avoid detection, and operated in all oceans with considerable effect. The German designation for the ships was '''Handelst\u00f6rkreuzer''<nowiki/>' thus the HSK serial assigned. Each had as well an administrative label more commonly used, e.g. Schiff 16 = Atlantis, Schiff 41 = Kormoran, etc. The auxiliary cruisers were:\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Orion||2}} (HSK-1, Schiff 36)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Atlantis||2}} (HSK-2, Schiff 16)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Widder||2}} (HSK-3, Schiff 21)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Thor||2}} (HSK-4, Schiff 10)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Pinguin||2}} (HSK-5, Schiff 33)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Stier||2}} (HSK-6, Schiff 23)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Komet||2}} (HSK-7, Schiff 45)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Kormoran||2}} (HSK-8, Schiff 41)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Michel||2}} (HSK-9, Schiff 28)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Coronel||2}} (HSK number not assigned, Schiff 14, never active in raider operations.)\n* {{ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Hansa||2}} (HSK not assigned, Schiff 5, never active in raider operations, used as a training ship)<ref>E.

Early classes were unstable, wet in heavy weather, suffered from engine problems and had short range. Some problems were solved with the evolution of later designs, but further developments were curtailed by the war and, ultimately, by Germany's defeat. In the first year of World War II, they were used mainly to sow offensive minefields in shipping lanes close to the British coast.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n====Torpedo boats====\n[[File:Wolf-1.jpg|thumb|[[German torpedoboats of World War II|''Raubtier'']]-class torpedo boats]]\n\n{{Main|German torpedoboats of World War II}}\n\nThese vessels evolved through the 1930s from small vessels, relying almost entirely on torpedoes, to what were effectively small destroyers with mines, torpedoes and guns. Two classes of fleet torpedo boats were planned, but not built, in the 1940s.\n\n====E-boats (''Schnellboote'')====\n{{Main|E-boat}}\nThe E-boats were [[fast attack craft]] with [[torpedo tube]]s. Over 200 boats of this type were built for the ''Kriegsmarine''.\n\n====Troop ships====\n{{SS|Cap Arcona|1927|2}}, {{MV|Goya||2}}, {{SS|General von Steuben||2}}, {{MV|Monte Rosa||2}}, {{MV|Wilhelm Gustloff||2}}.\n\n====Miscellaneous====\nThousands of smaller warships and auxiliaries served in the ''Kriegsmarine'', including [[minelayers]], [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s, mine transports, netlayers, floating AA and torpedo batteries, command ships, decoy ships (small merchantmen with hidden weaponry), [[gunboats]], monitors, escorts, patrol boats, sub-chasers, landing craft, landing support ships, training ships, test ships, torpedo recovery boats, dispatch boats, aviso, fishery protection ships, survey ships, harbor defense boats, target ships and their radio control vessels, motor explosive boats, weather ships, tankers, colliers, tenders, supply ships, tugs, barges, icebreakers, hospital and accommodation ships, floating cranes and docks, and many others. The ''Kriegsmarine'' employed hundreds of auxiliary ''[[Vorpostenboot]]e'' during the war, mostly civilian ships that were drafted and fitted with military equipment, for use in coastal operations.\n\n===Submarines (U-boat)===\n{{Main|U-boat}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-3491-06, St. Nazaire, Uboot U 94, Karl D\u00f6nitz.jpg|thumb|[[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] inspecting the [[Saint-Nazaire submarine base]] in France, June 1941]]\nAt the outbreak of war, the ''Kriegsmarine'' had a relatively small fleet of 57 submarines ([[U-boat]]s).<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Ireland\n | first = Bernard\n | authorlink = Bernard Ireland\n | title = Battle of the Atlantic\n | publisher = Pen & Sword Books\n | year = 2003\n | location = Barnsley, UK\n | pages = 32\n | url = \n | doi = \n | isbn = 1-84415-001-1 }}</ref> This was increased steadily until mid-1943, when losses from Allied counter-measures matched the new vessels launched.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Ireland\n | first = Bernard\n | authorlink = Bernard Ireland\n | title = Battle of the Atlantic\n | publisher = Pen & Sword Books\n | year = 2003\n | location = Barnsley, UK\n | pages = 225\n | url = \n | doi = \n | isbn = 1-84415-001-1 }}</ref>\n\nThe principal types were the [[German Type IX submarine|Type IX]], a long range type used in the western and southern Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans; and the [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII]], the most numerous type, used principally in the north Atlantic. [[German Type X submarine|Type X]] was a small class of minelayers and [[German Type XIV submarine|Type XIV]] was a specialized type used to support distant U-boat operations \u2013 the \"''Milchkuh''\" (Milkcow).\n\nTypes [[German Type XXI submarine|XXI]] and [[German Type XXIII submarine|XXIII]], the \"''[[Elektroboot]]''\", would have negated much of the Allied anti-submarine tactics and technology, but only a few of this new type of U-boat became ready for combat at the end of the war. Post-war, they became the prototypes for modern submarines, in particular, the Soviet {{sclass2-|Whiskey|submarine|4}}.\n\nDuring World War II, about 60% of all U-boats commissioned were lost in action; 28,000 of the 40,000 U-boat crewmen were killed during the war and 8,000 were captured.

His authority was exercised through the ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'', or OKM, with a Commander-in-Chief (''Oberbefehlshaber der Kriegsmarine''), a Chief of Naval General Staff (''Chef des Stabes der Seekriegsleitung'') and a Chief of Naval Operations (''Chef der Operationsabteilung'').<ref>{{cite web | last = Pipes | first = Jason | title = Organization of the Kriegsmarine | work = Feldgrau.com | date = 1996\u20132006 | url = http://www.feldgrau.com/kmsorg.html | accessdate = 2007-08-31 }}</ref> The first Commander-in-Chief of the OKM was [[Erich Raeder]] who was the Commander-in-Chief of the ''Reichsmarine'' when it was renamed and reorganized in 1935. Raeder held the post until falling out with Hitler after the German failure in the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]]. He was replaced by [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] on 30 January 1943 who held the command until he was appointed [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President of Germany]] upon Hitler's suicide in April 1945. [[Hans-Georg von Friedeburg]] was then Commander-in-Chief of the OKM for the short period of time until Germany surrendered in May 1945.\n\nSubordinate to these were regional, [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] and temporary [[flotilla]] commands. Regional commands covered significant naval regions and were themselves sub-divided, as necessary. They were commanded by a ''[[Generaladmiral]]'' or an [[Admiral (Germany)|Admiral]]. There was a ''Marineoberkommando'' for the Baltic Fleet, Nord, Nordsee, Norwegen, Ost/Ostsee (formerly Baltic), S\u00fcd and West. The ''Kriegsmarine'' used a form of encoding called ''[[Gradnetzmeldeverfahren]]'' to denote regions on a map.\n\nEach squadron (organized by type of ship) also had a command structure with its own [[Flag Officer]]. The commands were Battleships, Cruisers, Destroyers, Submarines (''[[F\u00fchrer der Unterseeboote]]''), Torpedo Boats, Minesweepers, Reconnaissance Forces, Naval Security Forces, Big Guns and Hand Guns, and Midget Weapons.\n\nMajor naval operations were commanded by a ''Flottenchef''. The ''Flottenchef'' controlled a flotilla and organized its actions during the operation. The commands were, by their nature, temporary.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'''s ship design bureau, known as the ''Marineamt'', was administered by officers with experience in sea duty but not in ship design, while the [[Naval architecture|naval architects]] who did the actual design work had only a theoretical understanding of design requirements. As a result the German surface fleet was plagued by design flaws throughout the war.<ref>{{cite web| last =Lienau| first =Peter| title =The Working Environment for German Warship design in WWI and WWII| publisher =Naval Weapons of the World| date =22 October 1999| url =http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-044.htm| accessdate = 23 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nCommunication was undertaken using an eight-rotor system of [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] encoding.\n\n===Air units===\nThe ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' had a near-complete monopoly on all German military aviation, including naval aviation, a major source of ongoing [[interservice rivalry]] with the ''Kriegsmarine''. Catapult-launched spotter planes like [[Arado Ar 196]] twin-float seaplanes were manned by the so-called ''Bordfliegergruppen'' (shipboard flying group).<ref>[http://www.feldgrau.com/BFGr196.htm Bordfliegergruppe 196]</ref> In addition, ''Tr\u00e4gergeschwader 186'' (Carrier Air [[Wing (air force unit)|Wing]] 186) operated two ''Gruppen'' (''Tr\u00e4gergruppe I/186'' and ''Tr\u00e4gergruppe II/186'')<ref>[http://www.feldgrau.com/TrGr186.htm Tr\u00e4gergruppe 186]</ref> equipped with navalized [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]T and [[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Ju 87C Stuka]]; these units were intended to serve aboard the aircraft carrier {{ship|German aircraft carrier|Graf Zeppelin||2}} which was never completed, yet provided the Kriegsmarine with some air-power from bases on land. Furthermore, five coastal groups (''K\u00fcstenfliegergruppen'') with [[reconnaissance aircraft]], [[torpedo bomber]]s, [[Minesweeper (ship)#Minesweeping aircraft|''Minensuch'' aerial minesweepers]] and [[air-sea rescue]] seaplanes supported the ''Kriegsmarine'', although with lesser resources as the war progressed.<ref>[http://www.wlb-stuttgart.de/seekrieg/lw/see.htm Luftwaffe naval-air units]</ref>\n\n===Coastal artillery, flak and radar units===\nThe [[coastal artillery|coastal batteries]] of the ''Kriegsmarine'' were stationed on the German coasts. With the conquering and occupation of other countries coastal artillery was stationed along the coasts of these countries, especially in France and Norway as part of the [[Atlantic Wall]].<ref name=\"P. Mallmann-Showell p. 75-91\">J. P. Mallmann-Showell: ''Das Buch der deutschen Kriegsmarine 1935\u20131945''. Publisher Motorbuch. Stuttgart 1995 {{ISBN|3-87943-880-3}} p. 75-91</ref> Naval bases were protected by [[anti-aircraft warfare|flak-batteries]] of the ''Kriegsmarine'' against enemy air raids. The ''Kriegsmarine'' also manned the [[Seetakt radar|''Seetakt'' sea radars]] on the coasts.<ref name=\"P. Mallmann-Showell p. 75-91\"/>\n\n===Marines===\nAt the beginning of World War II, on 1 September 1939, the ''[[Marinestosstruppkompanie|Marine Sto\u00dftrupp Kompanie]]'' (Marine Attack Troop Company) landed in [[Danzig]] from the old battleship {{SMS|Schleswig-Holstein||2}} for conquering a Polish bastion [[Battle of Westerplatte|at Westerplatte]]. A reinforced [[platoon]] of the ''Marine Sto\u00dftrupp Kompanie'' landed with soldiers of the German Army from destroyers on 9 April 1940 in [[Narvik]]. In June 1940 the ''Marine Sto\u00dftrupp Abteilung'' (Marine Attack Troop Battalion) was flown in from France to the [[Channel Islands]] to occupy this British territory.\n\nIn September 1944 amphibious units unsuccessfully tried to capture the strategic island [[Gogland|Suursaari]] in the [[Gulf of Finland]] from Germany's former ally Finland ([[Operation Tanne Ost]]).\n\nWith the [[invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944 and the Soviet advance from the summer of 1944 the ''Kriegsmarine'' started to form [[regiment]]s and [[Division (military)|division]]s for the battles on land with superfluous personnel. With the loss of naval bases because of the Allied advance more and more navy personnel were available for the ground troops of the ''Kriegsmarine''. About 40 regiments were raised and from January 1945 on six divisions. Half of the regiments were absorbed by the divisions.<ref>J\u00f6rg Benz: ''Deutsche Marineinfanterie 1938\u20131945''.

The war caused inter-communal conflicts between the Arakanese Muslims and Buddhists. Muslims fled from Japanese-controlled and Buddhist-majority regions to Muslim-dominated northern Arakan with many being killed. In return, a \"reverse ethnic cleansing\" was carried out. The Muslim attacks caused the Buddhists to flee to southern Arakan. Attacks by Muslim villagers on Buddhists also caused reprisals. With the consolidation of their position throughout northern Arakan, the Rohingyas retaliated against Japanese collaborators, particularly Buddhists. Though unofficial, specific undertaking were made to Arakanese Muslims after [[World War II]]. [[V Force]] officers like Andrew Irwin expressed enthusiasm to award Muslims for loyalty. Rohingya leaders believed that the British had promised them a \"Muslim National Area\" in present-day [[Maungdaw District]]. They were also apprehensive of a future Buddhist-dominated government. In 1946, the leaders made calls for annexation of the territory by Pakistan. Some also called for an independent state.

During [[Burma Campaign|World War II in Burma]] (present-day Myanmar), Rohingya Muslims, who were allied with the British and promised a Muslim state in return, fought against local Rakhine Buddhists, who were allied with the Japanese. Following independence in 1948, the newly formed [[Post-independence Burma, 1948\u201362|union government]] of the predominantly Buddhist country denied citizenship to the Rohingyas, subjecting them to extensive systematic discrimination in the country.

The war caused inter-communal conflicts between the Arakanese Muslims and Buddhists. Muslims fled from Japanese-controlled and Buddhist-majority regions to Muslim-dominated northern Arakan with many being killed. In return, a \"reverse ethnic cleansing\" was carried out. The Muslim attacks caused the Buddhists to flee to southern Arakan. Attacks by Muslim villagers on Buddhists also caused reprisals. With the consolidation of their position throughout northern Arakan, the Rohingyas retaliated against Japanese collaborators, particularly Buddhists. Though unofficial, specific undertaking were made to Arakanese Muslims after [[World War II]]. [[V Force]] officers like Andrew Irwin expressed enthusiasm to award Muslims for loyalty. Rohingya leaders believed that the British had promised them a \"Muslim National Area\" in present-day [[Maungdaw District]]. They were also apprehensive of a future Buddhist-dominated government.

[[Dutch_famine_of_1944\u201345|The city suffers from food shortages]], with more food available in the country. He stays with an [[eel]] fisher's family but, while there is an abundance of food, he suffers from homesickness. Jeroen and his friend Jan go to the ocean and see an American plane in the water; Jan tries to go under but claims there are too many eels and surfaces with a big cut on his thigh.\n\nThings change when the village is liberated by [[Canadians|Canadian]] troops. Jeroen meets Walt Cook ([[Andrew Kelley]]), a Canadian soldier in his early 20s, who befriends him. Walt at first treats Jeroen like a younger brother and the boy revels in the attention the soldier showers on him. Eventually, however, their relationship becomes sexual. They also engage in friendly, platonic activities, with Jeroen driving Walt's jeep and cleaning his guns. Jeroen's [[foster home|foster parents]] are aware of the closeness between the boy and Walt, but it is left ambiguous whether they are aware of the sexual nature of the relationship.\n\nAfter a few more days, Walt's unit is ordered to move and Walt leaves without saying goodbye. Jeroen hears from his foster sisters that the soldiers are leaving and rushes to their billet but finds that they have already left. (The film suggests that Walt attempts to tell Jeroen's foster father the previous evening that the troops would be leaving, but gives up when the language barrier becomes obvious.) Jeroen searches throughout town, unable to find any trace of Walt, and is further devastated when he returns home and sees that the shirt where he had stored a photo of Walt was on a clothesline in the rain, ruining the photo. Later that night, Jeroen is lying awake in his bed and notices Walt's dog tag on a scarecrow that had posed as \"Walt\" in a photo with his foster family, and races outside to grab the tag. However, Jeroen catches his hand on pigeon wire on the scarecrow and badly hurts it. He collapses in tears and is taken inside by his foster father. The next morning, his foster father notices the sunglasses that Walt left on the wire while his foster father is burning the dangerous scarecrow. After the war is over, Jeroen returns to his family in [[Amsterdam]], and later decides to go to [[United States|America]].\n\nThe film ends with grown-up Jeroen affectionately recalling the story and trying to express it as a [[ballet]] dance. While rehearsing the dance, his assistant hands him an envelope. He opens the envelope to find an enlargement of the only photo of him and the foster family and also a further enlargement of the soldier's dog tag with his identification. He realizes that he can now find his lost soldier.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Maarten Smit]]\t... \tJeroen Boman\n*[[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]]\t... \tJeroen Boman (adult)\n*[[Andrew Kelley]]\t... \tWalt Cook\n**Holden wrote that \"Walt seems almost as innocent as Jeroen\" although he had an \"inexplicable streak of bitterness\".<ref name=Holden/> Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that \"We have to wonder how Walt manages to be so completely at ease with his homosexuality, especially in the era in which this film is set.\"<ref name=ThomasK>{{cite web|author=Thomas, Kevin|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-08-06-ca-20808-story.html|title=MOVIE REVIEW : \u2018Soldier': A Brave Outing That Loses Focus |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1993-08-06|accessdate=2019-07-21}}</ref>\n*{{ill|Freark Smink|nl}}\t... \tHeit\n*{{ill|Elsje de Wijn|nl}}\t... \tMem\n*[[Derk-Jan Kroon]]\t... \tJan\n*[[Wiendelt Hooijer]]\t... \tHenk\n*[[Iris Misset]]\t... \tBonden\n*[[Gineke de Jager]]\t... \tElly\n*{{ill|Tatum Dagelet|nl}}\t... \tGertie\n*[[Marie-Jos\u00e9 Kouwenhoven]]\t... \tRenske\n*[[Valerie Valentine]]\t... \tLaura\n*[[William Sutton (actor)|William Sutton]]\t... \tChuck\n*[[Andrew Butling]]\t... \tBuikspreker\n*[[Andrew Cassani]]\t... \tWinslow\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\nHolden praised its \"refusal to load the story with contemporary psychological and social baggage\" but wrote that the film was unable to achieve a \"coherent dramatic frame\".<ref name=Holden/>\n\nThomas wrote that due to a lack of clarity over the homosexual themes, it \"delves into issues far too serious and controversial for such questions to go unanswered.\"<ref name=ThomasK/> He also stated that the confusion over language, as the film is partially in English and partially in Dutch, may have caused \"lacks crucial clarity\" despite good acting.<ref name=ThomasK/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0108504}}\n* {{Amg movie|132308|For a Lost Soldier}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|for_a_lost_soldier|For a Lost Soldier}}\n* For a Lost Soldier: An Interview with the film director Roeland Kerbosch [http://www.theskykid.com/movies/for-a-lost-soldier-an-interview-with-roeland-kerbosch/]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:For A Lost Soldier}}\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:1990s LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Films about hebephilia]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Dutch-language films]]\n[[Category:Dutch LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Teen LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:Childhood LGBT-related films]]\n[[Category:1990s drama films]]\n[[Category:World War II films]]\n[[Category:Autobiographical novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = For a Lost Soldier<br>Voor een Verloren Soldaat\n| image          = For a Lost Soldier.jpg\n| image_size     = \n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = [[Roeland Kerbosch]]\n| producer       = Guurtje Buddenberg<br>[[Matthijs van Heijningen]]\n| writer         = Don Bloch<br>Roeland Kerbosch<br>[[Rudi van Dantzig]] ''(novel)''\n| starring       = [[Maarten Smit]]<br>[[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]]<br>[[Andrew Kelley]]<br>[[Freark Smink]]<br>[[Elsje de Wijn]]\n| music          = [[Joop Stokkermans]]\n| cinematography = Nils Post\n| editing        = August Verschueren\n| distributor    = Malofilm Distribution<br>[[Concorde Pictures]]\n| released       = 22 May 1992\n| runtime        = 92 mins\n| country        = [[Netherlands]]\n| language       = Dutch<br>[[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]<br>English\n}}\n'''''For a Lost Soldier''''' (Dutch title: ''Voor een Verloren Soldaat'') is a 1992 [[Cinema of the Netherlands|Dutch film]] based upon the autobiographical novel of the same title by ballet dancer and choreographer [[Rudi van Dantzig]].
