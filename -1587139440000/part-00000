The marine bioregional planning process came from the implementation of this law. This process conserves marine biodiversity by considering the whole ecosystem a species is in and how different species interact in the marine environment.\n\nThere are two steps to this process. The first step is to identify regional conservation priorities in the five (currently) different marine regions. The second step is to identify marine reserves (protected areas or marine parks) to be added to Australia's National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. Like protected areas on land, marine reserves are created to protect biodiversity for generations to come. Marine reserves are identified based on criteria written in a document created by Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council called \"Guidelines for establishing the national representative system of marine protected areas\", also known as just \"the Guidelines\". These guidelines are nationally recognised and implemented at the local level based on the Australian policy for implementation outlined in the \"Goals and Principles for the Establishment of the National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas in Commonwealth Waters\". These policies are in place to make sure that a marine reserve is only added to the NRSMPA after careful evaluation of different data.\n\nThe priorities for each region are created based on human and environmental threats and the Marine Bioregional Plans are drafted to address these priorities. To assess different region's priorities, three steps are taken, first, a bioregional profile is created, second, a bioregional plan is drafted, and third, the plan is finalised. After the plan is finalised, activity in different bioregions may become limited based on particular threats an activity may pose.<ref name=\"Marine Bioregional Planning Process\">{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/mbp/publications/east/pubs/fs-mbp.pdf |title=Fact Sheet \u2013 Marine Regional Bioregional Planning \u2013 The Process |publisher=environment.gov.au |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314003841/http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/mbp/publications/east/pubs/fs-mbp.pdf |archivedate=14 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the GBRMPA released a report about the declining water quality in the Great Barrier Reef and detailed the importance of this issue. In response to this report, in 2003, the Australian and Queensland governments launched a joint initiative to improve the quality of water entering the Great Barrier Reef.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/about/history/|title=History|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216232922/http://reefplan.qld.gov.au/about/history/|archivedate=16 February 2017}}</ref> The decline in the quality of water over the past 150 years (due to development) has contributed to coral bleaching, [[algal bloom]]s, and [[pesticide pollution]]. These forms of pollution have made the reef less resilient to climate change.\n\nWhen the plan was introduced in October 2003, it originally contained 65 actions built on previous legislation. Their immediate goal was to halt and reverse the decline in water quality entering the reef by 2013. By 2020, they hope that the quality of the water entering in the reef improves enough so that it doesn't have a detrimental impact on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. To achieve these goals they decided to reduce pollutants in the water entering the reef and to rehabilitate and conserve areas of the reef that naturally help reduce water pollutants. To achieve the objectives described above, this plan focuses on non-point sources of pollution, which cannot be traced to a single source such as a waste outlet.\n\nThe plan specifically targets nutrients, pesticides and sediment that make their way into the reef as a result of agricultural activities. Other non-point sources of pollution that are attributed to urban areas are covered under different legislation. In 2009, the plan was updated. The updated version states that to date, none of the efforts undertaken to improve the quality of water entering the reef has been successful. The new plan attempts to address this issue by \"targeting priority outcomes, integrating industry and community initiatives and incorporating new policy and regulatory frameworks (Reef Plan&nbsp;5)\". This updated version has improved the clarity of the previous plan and targets set by that plan, have improved accountability and further improved monitoring and assessment. The 2009 report found that 41 out of the 65 actions met their original goals, however, 18 were not progressing well according to evaluation criteria as well as 6 were rated as having unsatisfactory levels of progress.\n\nSome key achievements made since the plan's initial passing in 2003 were the establishment of the Reef Quality Partnership to set targets, report findings and monitor progress towards targets, improved land condition by landowners was rewarded with extended leases, Water Quality Improvement Plans were created to identify regional targets and identified management changes that needed to be made to reach those targets, Nutrient Management Zones have been created to combat [[sediment]] loss in particular areas, education programs have been started to help gather support for sustainable agriculture, changes to land management practices have taken place through the implementation of the Farm Management Systems and codes of practice, the creation of the Queensland Wetland program and other achievements were made to help improve the water quality flowing into the coral reefs.\n\nA taskforce of scientists was also created to assess the impact of different parts of the plan on the quality of water flowing into the coral reefs. They found that many of the goals have yet to be reached but found more evidence that states that improving the water quality of the Great Barrier Reef will improve its resilience to climate change. The Reefocus summit in 2008, which is also detailed in the report, came to similar conclusions. After this, a stakeholder working group was formed that worked between several groups as well as the Australian and Queensland governments to update reef goals and objectives. The updated version of the plan focuses on strategic priority areas and actions to achieve 2013 goals. Also quantitative targets have been made to critically assess whether targets are being met.\n\nSome examples of the water quality goals outlined by this plan are that by 2013, there will be a 50% reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus loads at the end of catchments and that by 2020, there will be a reduction in sediment load by 20%. The plan also outlines a number of steps that must be taken by landholders to help improve grazing, soil, nutrient, and chemical management practices. There are also a number of supporting initiatives to take place outlined in the plan to help create a framework to improve land use practices which will in turn improve water quality.\n\nThrough these means the governments of Australia and Queensland hope to improve water quality by 2013. The 2013 outlook report and revised water quality plan will assess what needs to be done in the future to improve water quality and the livelihoods of the wildlife that resides there.<ref name=\"WQ protection plan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/library/pdf/reef-plan-2009.pdf |title=Reef Water Quality Protection Plan 2009 |publisher=reefplan.qld.gov.au |year=2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706122458/http://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/library/pdf/reef-plan-2009.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|upright|thumb|A blue starfish (''[[Linckia laevigata]]'') resting on hard ''[[Acropora]]'' and ''[[Porites]]'' corals]]\n\nIn July 2004, a new zoning plan took effect for the entire Marine Park, and has been widely acclaimed as a new global benchmark for [[marine ecosystem]] conservation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |year=2003 |title=Zoning Plan 2003 |url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/10591/Zoning_Plan.pdf |accessdate=14 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121160856/http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/10591/Zoning_Plan.pdf |archivedate=21 November 2008 }}</ref> The rezoning was based on the application of systematic conservation planning techniques, using [[marxan]] software.<ref>\nFernandes et al.

Furthermore, dredge spoil can literally smother reef or sea grass to death, while storms can repeatedly resuspend these particles so that the harm caused is ongoing; secondly, disturbed sea floor can release toxic substances into the surrounding environment.<ref name=\"Spoil\">{{cite news|title=Dredge dumping: just because you can doesn't mean you should|url=http://www.abc.net.au/environment/articles/2014/01/31/3935720.htm|accessdate=1 February 2014|publisher=ABC News|date=31 January 2014|author=Dermot O'Gorman|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203074313/http://www.abc.net.au/environment/articles/2014/01/31/3935720.htm|archivedate=3 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe dredge spoil from the Abbot Point port project is to be dumped {{convert|24|km|mi}} away, near Bowen in north Queensland, and the approval from the Authority will result in the production of an extra 70 million tonnes of coal annually, worth between A$1.4&nbsp;billion and $2.8&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"Spoil\" /> Authority chairman, Dr Russell Reichelt, stated after the confirmation of the approval:\n\n<blockquote>\nThis approval is in line with the agency's view that port development along the Great Barrier Reef coastline should be limited to existing ports.

Platforms are large, ship-like vessels that act as a base for tourists while scuba diving and snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef. Seabirds will land on the platforms and defecate which will eventually be washed into the sea. The feces carry nitrogen, phosphorus and often [[DDT]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which cause [[aspergillosis]], [[yellow-band disease]], and [[black band disease]]. Areas without tourism platforms have 14 out of 9,468 (1.1%) diseased corals versus areas with tourism platforms that have 172 out of 7,043 (12%) diseased corals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lamb|first=Joleah|author2=Bette Willis|title=Using coral disease prevalence to assess the effects of concentrating tourism activities on offshore reefs in a tropical marine park|journal=Conservation Biology|date=August 2011|volume=25|issue=5|pages=1044\u20131052|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01724.x|pmid=21848962}}</ref> Tourism is a major economic activity for the region. Thus, while non-permanent platforms could be possible in some areas, overall, permanent platforms are likely a necessity. Solutions have been suggested to siphon bird waste into gutters connecting to tanks helping lower runoff that causes coral disease.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kight|first=Caitlin|title=Are Coral Reefs Literally Sick of Ecotourists?|url=http://www.science20.com/anthrophysis/are_coral_reefs_literally_sick_ecotourists-82312|accessdate=15 March 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429185754/http://www.science20.com/anthrophysis/are_coral_reefs_literally_sick_ecotourists-82312|archivedate=29 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has also placed many permanent anchorage points around the general use areas. These act to reduce damage to the reef due to anchoring destroying soft coral, chipping hard coral, and disturbing sediment as it is dragged across the bottom.

The marine bioregional planning process came from the implementation of this law. This process conserves marine biodiversity by considering the whole ecosystem a species is in and how different species interact in the marine environment.\n\nThere are two steps to this process. The first step is to identify regional conservation priorities in the five (currently) different marine regions. The second step is to identify marine reserves (protected areas or marine parks) to be added to Australia's National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas. Like protected areas on land, marine reserves are created to protect biodiversity for generations to come. Marine reserves are identified based on criteria written in a document created by Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council called \"Guidelines for establishing the national representative system of marine protected areas\", also known as just \"the Guidelines\". These guidelines are nationally recognised and implemented at the local level based on the Australian policy for implementation outlined in the \"Goals and Principles for the Establishment of the National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas in Commonwealth Waters\". These policies are in place to make sure that a marine reserve is only added to the NRSMPA after careful evaluation of different data.\n\nThe priorities for each region are created based on human and environmental threats and the Marine Bioregional Plans are drafted to address these priorities. To assess different region's priorities, three steps are taken, first, a bioregional profile is created, second, a bioregional plan is drafted, and third, the plan is finalised. After the plan is finalised, activity in different bioregions may become limited based on particular threats an activity may pose.<ref name=\"Marine Bioregional Planning Process\">{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/mbp/publications/east/pubs/fs-mbp.pdf |title=Fact Sheet \u2013 Marine Regional Bioregional Planning \u2013 The Process |publisher=environment.gov.au |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314003841/http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/mbp/publications/east/pubs/fs-mbp.pdf |archivedate=14 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the GBRMPA released a report about the declining water quality in the Great Barrier Reef and detailed the importance of this issue. In response to this report, in 2003, the Australian and Queensland governments launched a joint initiative to improve the quality of water entering the Great Barrier Reef.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/about/history/|title=History|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216232922/http://reefplan.qld.gov.au/about/history/|archivedate=16 February 2017}}</ref> The decline in the quality of water over the past 150 years (due to development) has contributed to coral bleaching, [[algal bloom]]s, and [[pesticide pollution]]. These forms of pollution have made the reef less resilient to climate change.\n\nWhen the plan was introduced in October 2003, it originally contained 65 actions built on previous legislation. Their immediate goal was to halt and reverse the decline in water quality entering the reef by 2013. By 2020, they hope that the quality of the water entering in the reef improves enough so that it doesn't have a detrimental impact on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. To achieve these goals they decided to reduce pollutants in the water entering the reef and to rehabilitate and conserve areas of the reef that naturally help reduce water pollutants. To achieve the objectives described above, this plan focuses on non-point sources of pollution, which cannot be traced to a single source such as a waste outlet.\n\nThe plan specifically targets nutrients, pesticides and sediment that make their way into the reef as a result of agricultural activities. Other non-point sources of pollution that are attributed to urban areas are covered under different legislation. In 2009, the plan was updated. The updated version states that to date, none of the efforts undertaken to improve the quality of water entering the reef has been successful. The new plan attempts to address this issue by \"targeting priority outcomes, integrating industry and community initiatives and incorporating new policy and regulatory frameworks (Reef Plan&nbsp;5)\". This updated version has improved the clarity of the previous plan and targets set by that plan, have improved accountability and further improved monitoring and assessment. The 2009 report found that 41 out of the 65 actions met their original goals, however, 18 were not progressing well according to evaluation criteria as well as 6 were rated as having unsatisfactory levels of progress.\n\nSome key achievements made since the plan's initial passing in 2003 were the establishment of the Reef Quality Partnership to set targets, report findings and monitor progress towards targets, improved land condition by landowners was rewarded with extended leases, Water Quality Improvement Plans were created to identify regional targets and identified management changes that needed to be made to reach those targets, Nutrient Management Zones have been created to combat [[sediment]] loss in particular areas, education programs have been started to help gather support for sustainable agriculture, changes to land management practices have taken place through the implementation of the Farm Management Systems and codes of practice, the creation of the Queensland Wetland program and other achievements were made to help improve the water quality flowing into the coral reefs.\n\nA taskforce of scientists was also created to assess the impact of different parts of the plan on the quality of water flowing into the coral reefs. They found that many of the goals have yet to be reached but found more evidence that states that improving the water quality of the Great Barrier Reef will improve its resilience to climate change. The Reefocus summit in 2008, which is also detailed in the report, came to similar conclusions. After this, a stakeholder working group was formed that worked between several groups as well as the Australian and Queensland governments to update reef goals and objectives. The updated version of the plan focuses on strategic priority areas and actions to achieve 2013 goals. Also quantitative targets have been made to critically assess whether targets are being met.\n\nSome examples of the water quality goals outlined by this plan are that by 2013, there will be a 50% reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus loads at the end of catchments and that by 2020, there will be a reduction in sediment load by 20%. The plan also outlines a number of steps that must be taken by landholders to help improve grazing, soil, nutrient, and chemical management practices. There are also a number of supporting initiatives to take place outlined in the plan to help create a framework to improve land use practices which will in turn improve water quality.\n\nThrough these means the governments of Australia and Queensland hope to improve water quality by 2013. The 2013 outlook report and revised water quality plan will assess what needs to be done in the future to improve water quality and the livelihoods of the wildlife that resides there.<ref name=\"WQ protection plan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/library/pdf/reef-plan-2009.pdf |title=Reef Water Quality Protection Plan 2009 |publisher=reefplan.qld.gov.au |year=2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706122458/http://www.reefplan.qld.gov.au/library/pdf/reef-plan-2009.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|upright|thumb|A blue starfish (''[[Linckia laevigata]]'') resting on hard ''[[Acropora]]'' and ''[[Porites]]'' corals]]\n\nIn July 2004, a new zoning plan took effect for the entire Marine Park, and has been widely acclaimed as a new global benchmark for [[marine ecosystem]] conservation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |year=2003 |title=Zoning Plan 2003 |url=http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/10591/Zoning_Plan.pdf |accessdate=14 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121160856/http://www.gbrmpa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/10591/Zoning_Plan.pdf |archivedate=21 November 2008 }}</ref> The rezoning was based on the application of systematic conservation planning techniques, using [[marxan]] software.<ref>\nFernandes et al.

Furthermore, dredge spoil can literally smother reef or sea grass to death, while storms can repeatedly resuspend these particles so that the harm caused is ongoing; secondly, disturbed sea floor can release toxic substances into the surrounding environment.<ref name=\"Spoil\">{{cite news|title=Dredge dumping: just because you can doesn't mean you should|url=http://www.abc.net.au/environment/articles/2014/01/31/3935720.htm|accessdate=1 February 2014|publisher=ABC News|date=31 January 2014|author=Dermot O'Gorman|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203074313/http://www.abc.net.au/environment/articles/2014/01/31/3935720.htm|archivedate=3 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe dredge spoil from the Abbot Point port project is to be dumped {{convert|24|km|mi}} away, near Bowen in north Queensland, and the approval from the Authority will result in the production of an extra 70 million tonnes of coal annually, worth between A$1.4&nbsp;billion and $2.8&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"Spoil\" /> Authority chairman, Dr Russell Reichelt, stated after the confirmation of the approval:\n\n<blockquote>\nThis approval is in line with the agency's view that port development along the Great Barrier Reef coastline should be limited to existing ports.

Platforms are large, ship-like vessels that act as a base for tourists while scuba diving and snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef. Seabirds will land on the platforms and defecate which will eventually be washed into the sea. The feces carry nitrogen, phosphorus and often [[DDT]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which cause [[aspergillosis]], [[yellow-band disease]], and [[black band disease]]. Areas without tourism platforms have 14 out of 9,468 (1.1%) diseased corals versus areas with tourism platforms that have 172 out of 7,043 (12%) diseased corals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lamb|first=Joleah|author2=Bette Willis|title=Using coral disease prevalence to assess the effects of concentrating tourism activities on offshore reefs in a tropical marine park|journal=Conservation Biology|date=August 2011|volume=25|issue=5|pages=1044\u20131052|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01724.x|pmid=21848962}}</ref> Tourism is a major economic activity for the region. Thus, while non-permanent platforms could be possible in some areas, overall, permanent platforms are likely a necessity. Solutions have been suggested to siphon bird waste into gutters connecting to tanks helping lower runoff that causes coral disease.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kight|first=Caitlin|title=Are Coral Reefs Literally Sick of Ecotourists?|url=http://www.science20.com/anthrophysis/are_coral_reefs_literally_sick_ecotourists-82312|accessdate=15 March 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429185754/http://www.science20.com/anthrophysis/are_coral_reefs_literally_sick_ecotourists-82312|archivedate=29 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has also placed many permanent anchorage points around the general use areas. These act to reduce damage to the reef due to anchoring destroying soft coral, chipping hard coral, and disturbing sediment as it is dragged across the bottom.

Since the Emperor plans to personally oversee the final stages of its construction, the Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack on the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill the Emperor, effectively bringing an end to his hold over the galaxy. Meanwhile, [[Luke Skywalker]] struggles to bring his father [[Darth Vader]] back to the light side of [[the Force]].\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]], [[David Lynch]] and [[David Cronenberg]] were considered to direct the project before Marquand signed on as director. The production team relied on Lucas' storyboards during pre-production. While writing the shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and producer Howard Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it. Kazanjian's schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow [[Industrial Light & Magic]] more time to work on the film's effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from January to {{Start date|1982|5}}. Strict secrecy surrounded the production.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on May 25, 1983, six years to the day of the release of the first film, receiving mostly positive reviews. It grossed $475 million worldwide, becoming the [[1983 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 1983]]. Several re-releases and revisions to the film have followed over the decades.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries in film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] are sent to crime lord [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s palace on [[Tatooine]] in a trade bargain made by [[Luke Skywalker]] to rescue [[Han Solo]]. Disguised as a [[bounty hunter]], [[Princess Leia]] infiltrates the palace under the pretense of collecting the bounty on [[Chewbacca]] and unfreezes Han, but is caught and enslaved. Luke soon arrives to bargain for his friends' release, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be executed by a [[rancor]]. After Luke kills the rancor, Jabba sentences him, Han, and Chewbacca to death by being fed to the [[Sarlacc]], a huge, [[carnivorous plant]]-like desert beast. Having hidden his new [[lightsaber]] inside {{nowrap|R2-D2}}, Luke frees himself and battles Jabba's guards while Leia uses her chains to strangle Jabba to death. As the others rendezvous with the [[Rebel Alliance]], Luke returns to [[Dagobah]] to complete his training with [[Yoda]], whom he finds is dying. Yoda confirms that [[Darth Vader]], once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and becomes one with [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]]. The [[Force ghost]] of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister, and tells Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training <!--becoming a \"full-fledged Jedi Knight\" per A Guide to the Star Wars Universe--> and defeat the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]].\n\nThe Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a [[second Death Star]] under the supervision of [[Palpatine|the Emperor]] himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]]; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. Luke and Leia accompany the strike team to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of [[Ewok]]s and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust. Later, Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is their father, and that he must confront him. Surrendering to Imperial troops, he is brought before Vader, and tries to convince his father to reject the dark side of the Force, to no avail.\n\nVader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, intending to turn him to the dark side. The Emperor reveals that the Imperial forces are prepared for a Rebel assault on the shield generator and that the Rebel Fleet will fall into a trap. On the forest moon of Endor, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but a counterattack by the Ewoks allow the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator. Meanwhile, [[Lando Calrissian]] in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and [[Admiral Ackbar]] lead the rebel assault on the second Death Star only to find that the Death Star's shield is still active, and the Imperial fleet waits for them. \n\nThe Emperor reveals to Luke that the Death Star is fully operational and orders the firing of its massive superlaser, destroying one of the Rebel starships. The Emperor tempts Luke to give in to his anger. Luke attacks him, but Vader intervenes and the two engage in another lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister and threatens to turn her to the dark side. Enraged, Luke severs Vader's [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] hand. The Emperor entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses, declaring himself a Jedi like his father before him. Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with [[Force lightning]]. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down a reactor shaft to his death<!-- Lucas, McDiarmid, and The Rise of Skywalker's opening crawl all confirm he died. --> but is mortally electrocuted in the process. At his father's last request, Luke removes Vader's mask, and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker dies in his son's arms.\n\nAfter the strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads a group of Rebel fighters into the Death Star's core. While the Rebel fleet destroys the [[Super Star Destroyer]] ''Executor'', Lando and [[X-wing fighter]] pilot [[Wedge Antilles]] destroy the Death Star's main reactor. As the ''Falcon'' escapes the Death Star's superstructure and Luke escapes on a shuttle with his father's body, the station explodes. On the Forest Moon of Endor, Leia reveals to Han that Luke is her brother, and she and Han kiss. Luke cremates his father's body on a [[pyre]] before reuniting with his friends. As the Rebels and the galaxy celebrate the fall of the Empire, Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Anakin watching over him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Luke Skywalker]], one of the last living [[Jedi]] Knights, trained by Obi-Wan and Yoda; Leia's twin brother, who is also a skilled [[X-wing fighter]] pilot allied with the Rebellion.\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Han Solo]], a rogue smuggler aiding the Rebellion against the Empire, Luke\u2019s friend, and Leia's love interest.\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as [[Leia Organa]], the former princess of the destroyed planet [[Alderaan]], who is part of the Rebellion; Luke's twin sister, and Han's love interest.\n* [[Billy Dee Williams]] as [[Lando Calrissian]], the former Baron Administrator of Cloud City and one of Han's friends who aids the Rebellion.\n* [[Anthony Daniels]] as [[C-3PO]], a humanoid protocol droid in the service of the Rebellion.\n* [[Peter Mayhew]] as [[Chewbacca]], a [[Wookiee]] who is Han's longtime friend and part of the Rebellion.\n* [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] as [[R2-D2]], an astromech droid, friend of Luke, and longtime companion of C-3PO.

Harrison, unlike Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill signed only a two picture contract. That is why he was frozen in carbonite in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. When I suggested to George we should bring him back, I distinctly remember him saying that Harrison would never return. I said what if I convinced him to return. George simply replied that we would then write him in to ''Jedi''. I had just recently negotiated his deal for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' with Phil Gersh of the Gersh Agency. I called Phil who said he would speak with Harrison. When I called back again, Phil was on vacation. David, his son, took the call and we negotiated Harrison's deal.

Anthony Daniels returned as C-3PO, but [[Mark Hamill]] and [[Billy Dee Williams]] did not reprise their roles as they had for the first two radio dramas. They were replaced by newcomer Joshua Fardon as [[Luke Skywalker]] and character actor [[Arye Gross]] as [[Lando Calrissian]]. [[John Lithgow]] voiced Yoda, whose voice actor in the films has always been [[Frank Oz]]. Bernard Behrens returned as [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Brock Peters]] reprised his role as [[Darth Vader]]. Veteran character actor [[Ed Begley, Jr.]] played [[Boba Fett]]. [[Edward Asner]] also guest-starred speaking only in grunts as the voice of Jabba the Hutt. The radio drama had a running time of three hours.<ref>{{cite web |work=HighBridge Audio |title=Return of the Jedi Produced by NPR |url=http://www.highbridgeaudio.com/returnofjedi.html |accessdate=March 6, 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105043650/http://www.highbridgeaudio.com/returnofjedi.html| archive-date=November 5, 2006| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPrincipal production of the show was completed on February 11, 1996.

Since the Emperor plans to personally oversee the final stages of its construction, the Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack on the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill the Emperor, effectively bringing an end to his hold over the galaxy. Meanwhile, [[Luke Skywalker]] struggles to bring his father [[Darth Vader]] back to the light side of [[the Force]].\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]], [[David Lynch]] and [[David Cronenberg]] were considered to direct the project before Marquand signed on as director. The production team relied on Lucas' storyboards during pre-production. While writing the shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and producer Howard Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it. Kazanjian's schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow [[Industrial Light & Magic]] more time to work on the film's effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from January to {{Start date|1982|5}}. Strict secrecy surrounded the production.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on May 25, 1983, six years to the day of the release of the first film, receiving mostly positive reviews. It grossed $475 million worldwide, becoming the [[1983 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 1983]]. Several re-releases and revisions to the film have followed over the decades.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries in film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] are sent to crime lord [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s palace on [[Tatooine]] in a trade bargain made by [[Luke Skywalker]] to rescue [[Han Solo]]. Disguised as a [[bounty hunter]], [[Princess Leia]] infiltrates the palace under the pretense of collecting the bounty on [[Chewbacca]] and unfreezes Han, but is caught and enslaved. Luke soon arrives to bargain for his friends' release, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be executed by a [[rancor]]. After Luke kills the rancor, Jabba sentences him, Han, and Chewbacca to death by being fed to the [[Sarlacc]], a huge, [[carnivorous plant]]-like desert beast. Having hidden his new [[lightsaber]] inside {{nowrap|R2-D2}}, Luke frees himself and battles Jabba's guards while Leia uses her chains to strangle Jabba to death. As the others rendezvous with the [[Rebel Alliance]], Luke returns to [[Dagobah]] to complete his training with [[Yoda]], whom he finds is dying. Yoda confirms that [[Darth Vader]], once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and becomes one with [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]]. The [[Force ghost]] of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister, and tells Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training <!--becoming a \"full-fledged Jedi Knight\" per A Guide to the Star Wars Universe--> and defeat the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]].\n\nThe Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a [[second Death Star]] under the supervision of [[Palpatine|the Emperor]] himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]]; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. Luke and Leia accompany the strike team to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of [[Ewok]]s and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust. Later, Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is their father, and that he must confront him. Surrendering to Imperial troops, he is brought before Vader, and tries to convince his father to reject the dark side of the Force, to no avail.\n\nVader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, intending to turn him to the dark side. The Emperor reveals that the Imperial forces are prepared for a Rebel assault on the shield generator and that the Rebel Fleet will fall into a trap. On the forest moon of Endor, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but a counterattack by the Ewoks allow the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator. Meanwhile, [[Lando Calrissian]] in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and [[Admiral Ackbar]] lead the rebel assault on the second Death Star only to find that the Death Star's shield is still active, and the Imperial fleet waits for them. \n\nThe Emperor reveals to Luke that the Death Star is fully operational and orders the firing of its massive superlaser, destroying one of the Rebel starships. The Emperor tempts Luke to give in to his anger. Luke attacks him, but Vader intervenes and the two engage in another lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister and threatens to turn her to the dark side. Enraged, Luke severs Vader's [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] hand. The Emperor entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses, declaring himself a Jedi like his father before him. Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with [[Force lightning]]. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down a reactor shaft to his death<!-- Lucas, McDiarmid, and The Rise of Skywalker's opening crawl all confirm he died. --> but is mortally electrocuted in the process. At his father's last request, Luke removes Vader's mask, and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker dies in his son's arms.\n\nAfter the strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads a group of Rebel fighters into the Death Star's core. While the Rebel fleet destroys the [[Super Star Destroyer]] ''Executor'', Lando and [[X-wing fighter]] pilot [[Wedge Antilles]] destroy the Death Star's main reactor. As the ''Falcon'' escapes the Death Star's superstructure and Luke escapes on a shuttle with his father's body, the station explodes. On the Forest Moon of Endor, Leia reveals to Han that Luke is her brother, and she and Han kiss. Luke cremates his father's body on a [[pyre]] before reuniting with his friends. As the Rebels and the galaxy celebrate the fall of the Empire, Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Anakin watching over him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Luke Skywalker]], one of the last living [[Jedi]] Knights, trained by Obi-Wan and Yoda; Leia's twin brother, who is also a skilled [[X-wing fighter]] pilot allied with the Rebellion.\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Han Solo]], a rogue smuggler aiding the Rebellion against the Empire, Luke\u2019s friend, and Leia's love interest.\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as [[Leia Organa]], the former princess of the destroyed planet [[Alderaan]], who is part of the Rebellion; Luke's twin sister, and Han's love interest.\n* [[Billy Dee Williams]] as [[Lando Calrissian]], the former Baron Administrator of Cloud City and one of Han's friends who aids the Rebellion.\n* [[Anthony Daniels]] as [[C-3PO]], a humanoid protocol droid in the service of the Rebellion.\n* [[Peter Mayhew]] as [[Chewbacca]], a [[Wookiee]] who is Han's longtime friend and part of the Rebellion.\n* [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] as [[R2-D2]], an astromech droid, friend of Luke, and longtime companion of C-3PO.

Unlike the other stars of the first film, Ford had not contracted to do two sequels, and ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' had made him an even bigger star. ''Return of the Jedi'' producer [[Howard Kazanjian]] (who also produced ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'') convinced Ford to return: \n<blockquote>I played a very important part in bringing Harrison back for ''Return of the Jedi.'' Harrison, unlike Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill signed only a two picture contract. That is why he was frozen in carbonite in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. When I suggested to George we should bring him back, I distinctly remember him saying that Harrison would never return. I said what if I convinced him to return. George simply replied that we would then write him in to ''Jedi''. I had just recently negotiated his deal for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' with Phil Gersh of the Gersh Agency. I called Phil who said he would speak with Harrison. When I called back again, Phil was on vacation. David, his son, took the call and we negotiated Harrison's deal. When Phil returned to the office several weeks later he called me back and said I had taken advantage of his son in the negotiations. I had not.

Producer [[Howard Kazanjian]] estimated that using ILM (owned wholly by Lucasfilm) for special effects saved the production approximately $18 million.<ref name=\"ProdDir1\"/> However, the fact that Lucasfilm was a non-union company made acquiring shooting locations more difficult and more expensive, even though ''Star Wars'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' had been big hits.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\"/> The project was given the [[working title]] ''Blue Harvest'' with a tagline of \"Horror Beyond Imagination.\" This disguised what the production crew was really filming from fans and the press, and also prevented [[price gouging]] by service providers.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\"/>\n\nThe first stage of production started with 78 days at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in England,<ref name=\"ProdDir4\"/> where the film occupied all nine stages.

In the same year, Sony Classical re-pressed the 1997 RCA Victor release of ''Return of the Jedi'' along with the other two films in the trilogy. The set was released with the new artwork mirroring the first DVD release of the film.

Some years ago this program did beekeeping and extracted honey from their bees, which were kept in the Ecological Park.\n\nThe Ecological Park is a secondary forest adjacent to the Junior College; it protects the organisms that live in there. The ecological park is shared with [[Escuela Secundaria Tecnica Mexico]], the high school that is next to the Junior College. Students from E.S.T.M. also take care of the ecological park by cleaning the trails; they engage in a program with a butterfly sanctuary. The sanctuary is in one part of the ecological park.\n\n===Biology Natural Resource Management===\nFor the Biology Natural Resource Management program, every year the group works with organizations such as the [[Belize Audubon Society]] and [[Blue Ventures]] where they perform research data collection in marine studies in places like the Bacalar Chico Marine Reserve, Halfmoon Caye, and Calabash Caye. At the end of the year they present their data to the head of their department with members of the organizations.\n\n===Tourism===\nThe Tourism students partake in a wedding ceremony re-enactment as part of their curricular activities.

They are equipped with spacious classrooms, drafting tables, and specialized program named AutoCAD. As all other courses, Architecture students get the opportunity to create sophisticated models (houses, hotels, bridges among other complex structures).\n\n===Mathematics===\nThe mathematics group is normally small \u2014 mostly made up of five students. This course is difficult; therefore, not many students enroll. The mathematics students have the opportunity to share their knowledge with the adjacent high school, as they are invited to teach for a day.\n\n==In local culture==\nThis institution is new to the Corozal District; however, they have the intention of expanding. Their aim is to hire more teachers and add more courses. The institution counts with a storeroom for the agriculture department, a lab for the biology department, two labs for the IT, a food and beverage kitchen for the tourism department, and a conference room \u2014 along with the expansion of the staff room and the construction of the auditorium.\n\nEvery year Centro Escolar Mexico Junior College holds their [[open house (school)|open day]] when every program displays the skills and apply the knowledge they gain in theory.

Since 2010, it's integrated in the [[University of Lisbon (1911-2013)#Faculty of Letters|Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon]], and funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology ([[Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia|FCT]]), previously known as the National Board of Scientific Research ([[Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia|JNICT]]).

The institute's current director is Florence Plessis.\n\n==Course offerings==\nCIDEF offers two semesters, October\u2013February and February\u2013June. Students at CIDEF take around 18 hours of courses a week. The core course at CIDEF is a \"langue\" (language) course, which may meet from 6 to 12 hours a week. Other courses may be taken as electives. Incoming students are given a placement test which determines the level of study they will be placed into. Students at higher levels take fewer hours of language, and more electives. Examples of recent electives include business French, phonetics, grammar, English/French translation, art history, history of music, French literature, French history, oral expression, written expression, theology, philosophy, theater, and choir.\n\nAs for Summer courses, CIDEF offers three summer sessions, in July, August and September. The summer sessions offer more language study at the expense of fewer electives.\n\n==Student body==\nBoth the size and composition of the student body vary from semester to semester, however CIDEF generally has 200-300 students at any one time. The student body of CIDEF is diverse, reflecting global demands for French language instruction. Generally the nations of [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[China]], and the [[United States]] are the most heavily represented with Japan having the most students of all. Several American universities have exchange agreements with CIDEF through which their students may study at CIDEF, including the [[University of Notre Dame]][http://www.nd.edu] and Louisiana state universities and private colleges affiliated with [[CODOFIL]] (Council for the Development of French In Louisiana).  CODOFIL awards scholarships for French language study at a number of educational institutions, including CIDEF.  Other schools represented include the University of Oregon, Kansas, Auburn and Allegheny and Randolph-Macon Woman's Colleges.  Tulane University in [[New Orleans]] registers students for an August summer session, known as Prestage, before sending them to La Sorbonne for the academic year. These programs serve to facilitate the process of studying abroad, in particular finding housing and the transfer of academic credit. American students may also take courses independently.\n\n==Facilities==\nCIDEF shares the facilities of the Universite Catholique de L'Ouest and is located primarily in Hall Rene Bazin of UCO. Computers with internet access are available to CIDEF students, and WiFi network access is available as of January, 2006. CIDEF students also have access to UCO's main library.  Notre Dame has its own private computer room with 5 computers, two bookshelves, 6 chairs, two printers, and a mural.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.uco.fr/l-universite/faculte-instituts/centre-international-d-etude-de-la-langue-francaise-614.kjsp CIDEF's Website]\n\n{{coord missing|France}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Centre International Des Etudes Francaises}}\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in France]]\n[[Category:Schools of French as a second or foreign language]]\n[[Category:Angers]]\n", "text_old": "Le '''[[:fr:Centre international d'\u00e9tudes fran\u00e7aises (CIDEF)|Centre International d'\u00c9tudes Fran\u00e7aises]]''' (French for \"''International Center for French Studies''), also known as '''CIDEF''', is an academic program of the [[Catholic University of the West]] in [[Angers]], [[France]] that offers [[French language]] and culture courses to foreign students.
