Bandleader [[Steve Wynn (musician)|Steve Wynn]] reformed the band in 2012, and a fifth studio album was released in February 2017.<ref name=billions/>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years (1981\u20131983)===\nWhile attending the [[University of California, Davis]], [[Steve Wynn (songwriter)|Steve Wynn]] and [[Kendra Smith]] played together (with future [[True West (band)|True West]] members [[Russ Tolman]] and Gavin Blair) in a band called the Suspects, regarded as the first [[New wave music|new wave]]-influenced band in the [[Davis, California]], music scene. Wynn also recorded a 1981 single with a trio that he called 15 Minutes, which included members of [[Alternate Learning]].\n\nAfter Wynn moved back to Los Angeles, while rehearsing in a band called Goat Deity (with future [[Wednesday Week (band)|Wednesday Week]] sisters Kelly and Kristi Callan), Wynn met Karl Precoda, who had answered an ad for a bass player, and the two formed a new group, with Precoda switching to guitar. Smith joined on bass and brought in drummer Dennis Duck (Mehaffey), who had played in the locally successful Pasadena-based band Human Hands.\n\nDuck suggested the name \"the Dream Syndicate\" in reference to [[Tony Conrad]]'s early 1960s New York experimental ensemble (better known as the [[Theatre of Eternal Music]]), whose members included [[John Cale]].\n\nOn February 23, 1982, the Dream Syndicate performed its first show at Club Lingerie in Hollywood. A four-song [[Extended play|EP]] was recorded at the home of [[Tom Mehren]] in Pasadena, with [[Paul B. Cutler]] engineering and producing,<ref name=\"Rosen\">{{cite news |title=A new day dawns for restless Dream Syndicate |last=Rosen |first=Craig |date=5 January 1989 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=9E}}</ref> and released on Wynn's Down There label.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Art of Clubbing Makes a Comeback |last=Hochman |first=Steve |date=21 May 1989 |work=Los Angeles Times |page=76}}</ref> The band quickly achieved local attention for its often aggressively long, [[Audio feedback|feedback]]-soaked improvisations. Influences on the band, which was soon deemed \"a seminal force in the city's '80s underground rock evolution\", were [[the Velvet Underground]], [[Neil Young]]<ref name=\"hochman1990\">{{cite news |title=Steve Wynn Breaks Out of the Syndicate |last=Hochmann |first=Steve |date=3 June 1990 |work=Los Angeles Times |page=65}}</ref> and [[Television (band)|Television]].\n\nThe band signed to [[Slash Records]], whose subsidiary [[Ruby Records]] released its debut and by far best-known album, ''[[The Days of Wine and Roses]]'', in 1982. ''Days of Wine and Roses'' \"sent shockwaves through the American underground in the early 1980s,\" but [[MTV]] favored a different kind of music.<ref name=\"torn\">{{cite news |title=Rev. of Dream Syndicate, ''Ghost Stories'' and ''The Complete Live at Raji's'' |last=Torn |first=Luke |date=September\u2013October 2004 |work=[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]] |page=134}}</ref> [[Rough Trade Records]] released the album's lead track, \"Tell Me When It's Over\", in early 1983 as the [[A-side]] of a UK EP which also included a live cover of Neil Young's \"[[Mr. Soul]]\".\n\nSubsequently, Smith left the band and joined [[David Roback]] (formerly of [[Rain Parade]]) to form [[Opal (band)|Opal]]. She was replaced in the Dream Syndicate by David Provost.\n\n===Post-Kendra Smith years (1984\u20131989)===\n''[[Medicine Show (album)|Medicine Show]]'' was recorded in 1984 in San Francisco with producer [[Sandy Pearlman]] and released that year by [[A&M Records]]. The band opened tours for [[R.E.M.]] and [[U2]] and released the five-song live EP, ''This Is Not The New Dream Syndicate Album... Live!,'' the last record to feature Precoda on guitar (he left soon afterward to pursue a career in screenwriting) and the first appearance of bassist Mark Walton. The EP's commercial failure contributed to the group's temporary breakup,<ref name=\"Thompson2000\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |title=Alternative rock |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHP-r9-eqdAC&pg=PA339 |accessdate=26 April 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=Miller Freeman |isbn=9780879306076 |pages=339\u2013 }}</ref> The band was dropped by A&M after the label rejected its demo for \"Slide Away\", later released on the semi-official ''It's Too Late to Stop Now''.\n\nIn 1985, during the band's temporary retirement, Wynn and [[Dan Stuart]] of [[Green on Red]] wrote 10 songs together that were recorded with Duck, among others, and released by A&M as the album ''[[The Lost Weekend (album)|The Lost Weekend]]'' under the name Danny & Dusty.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus (and, as one reviewer said, having taken \"a trip through the major-label meat grinder\"<ref name=\"torn\"/>), Wynn, Duck and Walton joined with [[Paul B.

Wynn also recorded a 1981 single with a trio that he called 15 Minutes, which included members of [[Alternate Learning]].\n\nAfter Wynn moved back to Los Angeles, while rehearsing in a band called Goat Deity (with future [[Wednesday Week (band)|Wednesday Week]] sisters Kelly and Kristi Callan), Wynn met Karl Precoda, who had answered an ad for a bass player, and the two formed a new group, with Precoda switching to guitar. Smith joined on bass and brought in drummer Dennis Duck (Mehaffey), who had played in the locally successful Pasadena-based band Human Hands.\n\nDuck suggested the name \"the Dream Syndicate\" in reference to [[Tony Conrad]]'s early 1960s New York experimental ensemble (better known as the [[Theatre of Eternal Music]]), whose members included [[John Cale]].\n\nOn February 23, 1982, the Dream Syndicate performed its first show at Club Lingerie in Hollywood. A four-song [[Extended play|EP]] was recorded at the home of [[Tom Mehren]] in Pasadena, with [[Paul B. Cutler]] engineering and producing,<ref name=\"Rosen\">{{cite news |title=A new day dawns for restless Dream Syndicate |last=Rosen |first=Craig |date=5 January 1989 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |page=9E}}</ref> and released on Wynn's Down There label.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Art of Clubbing Makes a Comeback |last=Hochman |first=Steve |date=21 May 1989 |work=Los Angeles Times |page=76}}</ref> The band quickly achieved local attention for its often aggressively long, [[Audio feedback|feedback]]-soaked improvisations. Influences on the band, which was soon deemed \"a seminal force in the city's '80s underground rock evolution\", were [[the Velvet Underground]], [[Neil Young]]<ref name=\"hochman1990\">{{cite news |title=Steve Wynn Breaks Out of the Syndicate |last=Hochmann |first=Steve |date=3 June 1990 |work=Los Angeles Times |page=65}}</ref> and [[Television (band)|Television]].\n\nThe band signed to [[Slash Records]], whose subsidiary [[Ruby Records]] released its debut and by far best-known album, ''[[The Days of Wine and Roses]]'', in 1982. ''Days of Wine and Roses'' \"sent shockwaves through the American underground in the early 1980s,\" but [[MTV]] favored a different kind of music.<ref name=\"torn\">{{cite news |title=Rev. of Dream Syndicate, ''Ghost Stories'' and ''The Complete Live at Raji's'' |last=Torn |first=Luke |date=September\u2013October 2004 |work=[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]] |page=134}}</ref> [[Rough Trade Records]] released the album's lead track, \"Tell Me When It's Over\", in early 1983 as the [[A-side]] of a UK EP which also included a live cover of Neil Young's \"[[Mr. Soul]]\".\n\nSubsequently, Smith left the band and joined [[David Roback]] (formerly of [[Rain Parade]]) to form [[Opal (band)|Opal]]. She was replaced in the Dream Syndicate by David Provost.\n\n===Post-Kendra Smith years (1984\u20131989)===\n''[[Medicine Show (album)|Medicine Show]]'' was recorded in 1984 in San Francisco with producer [[Sandy Pearlman]] and released that year by [[A&M Records]]. The band opened tours for [[R.E.M.]] and [[U2]] and released the five-song live EP, ''This Is Not The New Dream Syndicate Album... Live!,'' the last record to feature Precoda on guitar (he left soon afterward to pursue a career in screenwriting) and the first appearance of bassist Mark Walton.

He is best known for composing the ''[[Kavyadarsha|K\u0101vy\u0101dar\u015ba]]'' ('Mirror of Poetry'), the handbook of classical Sanskrit poetics, or ''[[K\u0101vya]]'', which appears to be intact. Debate continues over whether these were composed by a single person, but 'there is now a wide consensus that a single Da\u1e47\u1e0din in authored all these works at the Pallava court in K\u0101\u00f1c\u012b around the end of the seventh century'.{{sfnp|Bronner|2011|p=71\u201373, quoting 77}}\n\n== Works ==\n\n===''K\u0101vy\u0101dar\u015ba''===\n{{main|Kavyadarsha}}\nThe ''K\u0101vy\u0101dar\u015ba'' is the earliest surviving systematic treatment of poetics in Sanskrit.

Although modern scholars have debated who  was borrowing from whom, or responding to whom, Bh\u0101maha appears to have been earlier, and that Da\u1e47\u1e0din was responding to him.

In particular the Soviets gained control of the main [[Mittelwerk|V-2 manufacturing facility]] at [[Nordhausen]], and had 30 V-2 missiles assembled there by September 1946.\n\nIn October 1946 the Soviets transferred the German missile engineers working for them to a special research facility near [[Moscow]], where they were forced to remain until the mid-1950s. The Soviets established a missile design bureau of their own ([[OKB-1]]), under the direction of [[Sergei Korolev]]. This team was directed to create a Soviet capability to build missiles, starting with a Soviet copy of the German V-2 and moving to more advanced, Soviet-designed missiles in the near future.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ivkin|first=Vladimir|date=May 2006|title=\u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041d\u0430 \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0432 - \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430 CCCP \u041e\u0442 13 \u041c\u0430\u044f 1946 \u0413. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e \u041a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0414\u043b\u044f \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0420\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f|trans-title=The decision on the breakthrough - the resolution of the USSR Council of Decisions from may 13, 1946 became the key for the development of the rocket|url=http://www.vpk-news.ru/article.asp?pr_sign=archive.2006.135.articles.history_01|journal=VPK|language=ru|volume=19|issue=135|pages=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325110923/http://www.vpk-news.ru/article.asp?pr_sign=archive.2006.135.articles.history_01|archive-date=2008-03-25|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:R-1 SS-1.svg|thumb|418x418px|Drawing of the Soviet R-1 missile, NATO code SS-1 Scunner]]\nIn April 1947 Stalin authorised the production of the R-1 missile, the designation for the Soviet copy of V-2.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/r1.htm |title=R1|last=Wade|first=Marc|date=|website=Encyclopedia Astronautica|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922211630/http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/r1.htm|archive-date=2012-09-22|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> The first tests of the missile began in September 1948.

are the contributions within [[Turkey]] to the emission of [[greenhouse gasses]] such as [[carbon dioxide]] or [[ hydrofluorocarbons]]. Turkey's human contributions to emissions can be segmented by sector, such as looking specifically at [[List of power stations in Turkey|Turkey's power stations]] or transport.

Possibly from the [[Calima culture]] (100-500 CE)]]\n[[File:King Tut Burial Mask.jpg|thumb|Tutankhamum's mummy mask Gold; [[Egypt]].]]\n'''''Repouss\u00e9''''' {{IPA-fr|\u0281\u0259puse||fr-repouss\u00e9.ogg}} or '''''repoussage''''' {{IPA-fr|\u0281\u0259pusa\u0292||fr-repoussage.ogg}} refer to a [[metalworking]] technique in which a [[malleable]] [[metal]] is shaped by [[hammer]]ing from the reverse side to create a design in [[low relief]].   '''Chasing''', '''chased work''', or '''embossing''' refer to a similar technique, in which the piece is hammered on the front side, sinking the metal. The two techniques are often used in conjunction.\n\nMany metals can be used for chasing and repouss\u00e9 work, including [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], and alloys such as [[steel]], [[bronze]], and [[pewter]].\n\nThese techniques are very ancient and have been extensively used all over the world, as they require only the simplest tools and materials, and yet allow great diversity of expression.  They are also relatively economical, since there is no loss or waste of metal, which mostly retains its original size and thickness.  Toolmarks are often intentionally left visible in the result.\n\nA few among many famous examples of repouss\u00e9 and chasing are the prehistoric [[Gundestrup cauldron]], the mask on the mummy of [[Tutankhamun]], the body-fitting armours of the [[Bronze Age]], the copper ornaments made by the [[Native American people|Native Americans]] in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern US]], and the [[Statue of Liberty]] in [[New York City|New York]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''repouss\u00e9'' is [[French language|French]] and means \"pushed up\", ultimately from [[Latin]] ''pulsare'', which means \"to push\". Repoussage is the [[noun]] to refer to the technique, with ''repouss\u00e9'' being an [[adjective]] referring to a piece to which the technique has been applied (e.g. \"''repouss\u00e9'' work\", \"''repouss\u00e9'' piece\"). \n\nChasing comes from the French word, ''chasser'' meaning to drive out, or to chase around which is what the artists are doing as they \"chase\" the forms on their metal in order to create their final design.\n\n== History ==\nThe techniques of repouss\u00e9 and chasing date from Antiquity and have been used widely with [[gold]] and [[silver]] for fine detailed work and with [[copper]], [[tin]], and [[bronze]] for larger sculptures.\n\n[[Image:16th Century Tibet repousse.jpg|thumb|Gilt copper repouss\u00e9 from Tibet, 16th century]]\n\n===European Prehistory and Bronze Age===\nDuring the 3rd millennium BC, in the Middle East, a variety of semi-mass production methods were introduced to avoid repetitive free-hand work. With the simplest technique, sheet gold could be pressed into designs carved in ''intaglio'' in stone, bone, metal or even materials such as [[jet (lignite)|jet]].  The gold could be worked into the designs with wood tools or, more commonly, by hammering a wax or lead \"force\" over it.\n\nThe alternative to pressing gold sheet into a die is to work it over a design in cameo relief.  Here the detail would be greater on the back of the final design, so some final chasing from the front was often carried out to sharpen the detail. \n\nThe use of patterned punches dates back to the first half of the [[2nd millennium BC]], if not far earlier. The simplest patterned punches were produced by loops or scrolls of wire.\n\nThe [[Gundestrup cauldron]] (a product of the [[Celts|Celtic]] culture, made between 150 BCE and 1 AD) had originally) thirteen separate silver panels, with repouss\u00e9 [[relief]], lining the inside and outside of the vessel.\n\n===Ancient Egypt===\nIn 1400 BC, the Egyptian [[Amarna]] period, resin and mud for repouss\u00e9 backing was in use.  \n\nA fine example of Egyptian repouss\u00e9 is the mummy mask of [[Tutankhamun]], a [[Pharaoh]] of the late [[Eighteenth Dynasty]]. The majority of the mask was formed using the technique of repouss\u00e9 from what appears to be a single sheet of gold. The lapis lazuli and other stones were inlaid in chased areas after the height of the form was completed.  The ceremonial beard, [[Nekhbet]] vulture, and [[Uraeus]] were attached separately. \n\n===Classical antiquity===\n[[Image:Byzantine - Chalice with Apostles Venerating the Cross - Walters 57636 - Profile.jpg|thumb| One of twenty-three silver altar vessels believed to have been found in the Syrian village of Kurin.  Silver repouss\u00e9, partial gilt.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]\n |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/9463\n |title=Chalice with Apostles Venerating the Cross}}</ref> The Walters Art Museum.]] \nBy [[Hellenistic]] times, combined punches and dies were in use. In 400 BC, the Greeks were using Beeswax for filler in repouss\u00e9.\n\nClassical pieces using repoussage and chasing include the [[bronze]] [[Greece|Greek]] armour plates from the 3rd century BC.\n\nThe [[Warren Cup]] is a Roman silver cup, and the [[Mildenhall Treasure]], the [[Hoxne Hoard]], the [[Water Newton Treasure]] and the [[Berthouville Treasure]] are examples of [[hoard]]s of Roman silver found in [[England]] and northern [[France]] with many pieces using these techniques.\n\n===India===\nRepouss\u00e9 and chasing are commonly used in [[India]] to create objects such as water vessels. These vessels are generally made using sheets of [[copper]] or [[silver]].\n\n===Pre-Columbian America===\nRepoussage and chasing were used by many Pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas, such as the [[Chav\u00edn culture]] of [[Peru]] (about 900 to 200 BCE), to make ornaments of gold and other metals.\n\nDuring the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] and [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] periods of the American [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] goods of repouss\u00e9 copper were fashioned as ritual regalia and eventually used in prestige burials.<ref>{{cite book | last = Power | first = Susan | title = Early Art of the Southeastern Indians-Feathered Serpents and Winged Beings | url = https://archive.org/details/earlyartofsouthe0000powe | url-access = registration | publisher = [[University of Georgia Press]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8203-2501-5}}</ref> Examples have been found with many S.E.C.C. designs such as [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Motifs|Bi-lobed arrow motif]] headdresses and [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|falcon dancer]] plaques.

The statue was formed by [[copper]] repouss\u00e9 in sections using wooden structures to shape each piece during the  hammering process. \n<gallery>\nFile:Rawnsley shield.jpg|Arts and Crafts repousse shield made by [[Keswick School of Industrial Art]], UK, 1895\nFile:Repujado- caballo griego alestilo del per\u00edodo geom\u00e9trico, por el artista mexicano Manolo Vega, 2011.jpg|Repouss\u00e8 on tin sheet \u2013 \"Greek horse\" by Mexican artist Manolo Vega, 2011\nFile:Statueofliberty.jpg|The Statue of Liberty, New York (NY)\nFile:Construction of the Statue2.jpg|Construction of The Statue of Liberty\n</gallery>\n\n== Methods ==\n[[Image:Maurice Ascalon 2.jpg|thumb|Sculptor [[Maurice Ascalon]] at work undertaking the finishing chasing of a copper repouss\u00e9 relief sculpture circa 1939.]]\n\nThe process of chasing and repouss\u00e9 requires a number of steps.\n\n===Annealing===\nThe metal plate should usually be [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]]\u2014that is, heated for some time at a temperature somewhat below its melting point\u2014to make it as [[malleability|malleable]] as possible.  This process may have to be repeated several times, as many metals [[work hardening|harden]] and become brittle as they are deformed by the hammering.\n\n===Pitch backing===\nThe plate must then be fixed on a suitable support.  A commonly used technique is to place the metal over a layer of [[chasers pitch]].  The pitch is heated until it is soft enough to make good contact with the metal, filling all its nooks and crannies, and then allowed to cool.  At room temperature, the pitch must be hard enough to adhere to the metal and hold it in place, but still soft and [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] enough to \"give\" as the metal is hammered into it.\n\nThe pitch is often cast as a thick layer over some softer backing material that can absorb larger deformations.\n\nThe metal plate will have to be released from the pitch several times, for turning it over and/or for re-anealing.  Pitch residues stuck to the plate must be removed with an appropriate [[solvent]].\n\n===Lining===\nOnce the plate is firmly held by the pitch, front side up, the outline of the desired design is lightly chased (\"lined\") on it by a special tool (a \"liner\"), that creates narrow raised lines on the other side. \n\n===Repouss\u00e9 and chasing===\nThe metal is turned over, and firmed again over the pitch, with the back side up. The main repouss\u00e9 work is then performed, using a variety of punches.\n\nOnce the main repouss\u00e9 is done, the piece is again released by heating.  The cavities on the back side, created by the repouss\u00e9  work, are filled with melted pitch.  Once that filling has hardened, the plate is again turned over and placed on top of a layer of softened pitch.  Once the pitch has hardened, the design is then refined by chasing.  These procedures can be repeated several times, alternating between repouss\u00e9 and chasing.  \n\n===Hot forming===\nRepouss\u00e9 and chasing can also be done on materials, like [[steel]], that are too hard to be cold-formed by hammering.  That is accomplished by heating the piece to a high enough temperature to make it malleable, as in [[forging]].  In this case pitch must be dispensed with, or replaced by some material (like sand) that can withstand the heat and provide the right kind of \"giving\" support.\n\n== Tools ==\nThe tools needed for these techniques are \n<ref name=oppi2011>Oppi Untracht (2011): ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kqZ1-HM9MBwC&lpg=PT508&dq=jeweler's%20pitch&pg=PT508#v=onepage&q=jeweler's%20pitch&f=false Jewelry Concepts & Technology]''.

'''Chasing''', '''chased work''', or '''embossing''' refer to a similar technique, in which the piece is hammered on the front side, sinking the metal. The two techniques are often used in conjunction.\n\nMany metals can be used for chasing and repouss\u00e9 work, including [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], and alloys such as [[steel]], [[bronze]], and [[pewter]].\n\nThese techniques are very ancient and have been extensively used all over the world, as they require only the simplest tools and materials, and yet allow great diversity of expression.  They are also relatively economical, since there is no loss or waste of metal, which mostly retains its original size and thickness.  Toolmarks are often intentionally left visible in the result.\n\nA few among many famous examples of repouss\u00e9 and chasing are the prehistoric [[Gundestrup cauldron]], the mask on the mummy of [[Tutankhamun]], the body-fitting armours of the [[Bronze Age]], the copper ornaments made by the [[Native American people|Native Americans]] in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern US]], and the [[Statue of Liberty]] in [[New York City|New York]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''repouss\u00e9'' is [[French language|French]] and means \"pushed up\", ultimately from [[Latin]] ''pulsare'', which means \"to push\". Repoussage is the [[noun]] to refer to the technique, with ''repouss\u00e9'' being an [[adjective]] referring to a piece to which the technique has been applied (e.g. \"''repouss\u00e9'' work\", \"''repouss\u00e9'' piece\"). \n\nChasing comes from the French word, ''chasser'' meaning to drive out, or to chase around which is what the artists are doing as they \"chase\" the forms on their metal in order to create their final design.\n\n== History ==\nThe techniques of repouss\u00e9 and chasing date from Antiquity and have been used widely with [[gold]] and [[silver]] for fine detailed work and with [[copper]], [[tin]], and [[bronze]] for larger sculptures.\n\n[[Image:16th Century Tibet repousse.jpg|thumb|Gilt copper repouss\u00e9 from Tibet, 16th century]]\n\n===European Prehistory and Bronze Age===\nDuring the 3rd millennium BC, in the Middle East, a variety of semi-mass production methods were introduced to avoid repetitive free-hand work. With the simplest technique, sheet gold could be pressed into designs carved in ''intaglio'' in stone, bone, metal or even materials such as [[jet (lignite)|jet]].  The gold could be worked into the designs with wood tools or, more commonly, by hammering a wax or lead \"force\" over it.\n\nThe alternative to pressing gold sheet into a die is to work it over a design in cameo relief.  Here the detail would be greater on the back of the final design, so some final chasing from the front was often carried out to sharpen the detail. \n\nThe use of patterned punches dates back to the first half of the [[2nd millennium BC]], if not far earlier. The simplest patterned punches were produced by loops or scrolls of wire.\n\nThe [[Gundestrup cauldron]] (a product of the [[Celts|Celtic]] culture, made between 150 BCE and 1 AD) had originally) thirteen separate silver panels, with repouss\u00e9 [[relief]], lining the inside and outside of the vessel.\n\n===Ancient Egypt===\nIn 1400 BC, the Egyptian [[Amarna]] period, resin and mud for repouss\u00e9 backing was in use.  \n\nA fine example of Egyptian repouss\u00e9 is the mummy mask of [[Tutankhamun]], a [[Pharaoh]] of the late [[Eighteenth Dynasty]]. The majority of the mask was formed using the technique of repouss\u00e9 from what appears to be a single sheet of gold. The lapis lazuli and other stones were inlaid in chased areas after the height of the form was completed.  The ceremonial beard, [[Nekhbet]] vulture, and [[Uraeus]] were attached separately. \n\n===Classical antiquity===\n[[Image:Byzantine - Chalice with Apostles Venerating the Cross - Walters 57636 - Profile.jpg|thumb| One of twenty-three silver altar vessels believed to have been found in the Syrian village of Kurin.  Silver repouss\u00e9, partial gilt.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]\n |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/9463\n |title=Chalice with Apostles Venerating the Cross}}</ref> The Walters Art Museum.]] \nBy [[Hellenistic]] times, combined punches and dies were in use. In 400 BC, the Greeks were using Beeswax for filler in repouss\u00e9.\n\nClassical pieces using repoussage and chasing include the [[bronze]] [[Greece|Greek]] armour plates from the 3rd century BC.\n\nThe [[Warren Cup]] is a Roman silver cup, and the [[Mildenhall Treasure]], the [[Hoxne Hoard]], the [[Water Newton Treasure]] and the [[Berthouville Treasure]] are examples of [[hoard]]s of Roman silver found in [[England]] and northern [[France]] with many pieces using these techniques.\n\n===India===\nRepouss\u00e9 and chasing are commonly used in [[India]] to create objects such as water vessels. These vessels are generally made using sheets of [[copper]] or [[silver]].\n\n===Pre-Columbian America===\nRepoussage and chasing were used by many Pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas, such as the [[Chav\u00edn culture]] of [[Peru]] (about 900 to 200 BCE), to make ornaments of gold and other metals.\n\nDuring the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] and [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] periods of the American [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] goods of repouss\u00e9 copper were fashioned as ritual regalia and eventually used in prestige burials.<ref>{{cite book | last = Power | first = Susan | title = Early Art of the Southeastern Indians-Feathered Serpents and Winged Beings | url = https://archive.org/details/earlyartofsouthe0000powe | url-access = registration | publisher = [[University of Georgia Press]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8203-2501-5}}</ref> Examples have been found with many S.E.C.C. designs such as [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Motifs|Bi-lobed arrow motif]] headdresses and [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|falcon dancer]] plaques.

The statue was formed by [[copper]] repouss\u00e9 in sections using wooden structures to shape each piece during the  hammering process. \n<gallery>\nFile:Rawnsley shield.jpg|Arts and Crafts repousse shield made by [[Keswick School of Industrial Art]], UK, 1895\nFile:Repujado- caballo griego alestilo del per\u00edodo geom\u00e9trico, por el artista mexicano Manolo Vega, 2011.jpg|Repouss\u00e8 on tin sheet \u2013 \"Greek horse\" by Mexican artist Manolo Vega, 2011\nFile:Statueofliberty.jpg|The Statue of Liberty, New York (NY)\nFile:Construction of the Statue2.jpg|Construction of The Statue of Liberty\n</gallery>\n\n== Methods ==\n[[Image:Maurice Ascalon 2.jpg|thumb|Sculptor [[Maurice Ascalon]] at work undertaking the finishing chasing of a copper repouss\u00e9 relief sculpture circa 1939.]]\n\nThe process of chasing and repouss\u00e9 requires a number of steps.\n\n===Annealing===\nThe metal plate should usually be [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]]\u2014that is, heated for some time at a temperature somewhat below its melting point\u2014to make it as [[malleability|malleable]] as possible.  This process may have to be repeated several times, as many metals [[work hardening|harden]] and become brittle as they are deformed by the hammering.\n\n===Pitch backing===\nThe plate must then be fixed on a suitable support.  A commonly used technique is to place the metal over a layer of [[chasers pitch]].  The pitch is heated until it is soft enough to make good contact with the metal, filling all its nooks and crannies, and then allowed to cool.  At room temperature, the pitch must be hard enough to adhere to the metal and hold it in place, but still soft and [[plasticity (physics)|plastic]] enough to \"give\" as the metal is hammered into it.\n\nThe pitch is often cast as a thick layer over some softer backing material that can absorb larger deformations.\n\nThe metal plate will have to be released from the pitch several times, for turning it over and/or for re-anealing.  Pitch residues stuck to the plate must be removed with an appropriate [[solvent]].\n\n===Lining===\nOnce the plate is firmly held by the pitch, front side up, the outline of the desired design is lightly chased (\"lined\") on it by a special tool (a \"liner\"), that creates narrow raised lines on the other side. \n\n===Repouss\u00e9 and chasing===\nThe metal is turned over, and firmed again over the pitch, with the back side up. The main repouss\u00e9 work is then performed, using a variety of punches.\n\nOnce the main repouss\u00e9 is done, the piece is again released by heating.  The cavities on the back side, created by the repouss\u00e9  work, are filled with melted pitch.  Once that filling has hardened, the plate is again turned over and placed on top of a layer of softened pitch.  Once the pitch has hardened, the design is then refined by chasing.  These procedures can be repeated several times, alternating between repouss\u00e9 and chasing.  \n\n===Hot forming===\nRepouss\u00e9 and chasing can also be done on materials, like [[steel]], that are too hard to be cold-formed by hammering.  That is accomplished by heating the piece to a high enough temperature to make it malleable, as in [[forging]].  In this case pitch must be dispensed with, or replaced by some material (like sand) that can withstand the heat and provide the right kind of \"giving\" support.\n\n== Tools ==\nThe tools needed for these techniques are \n<ref name=oppi2011>Oppi Untracht (2011): ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kqZ1-HM9MBwC&lpg=PT508&dq=jeweler's%20pitch&pg=PT508#v=onepage&q=jeweler's%20pitch&f=false Jewelry Concepts & Technology]''.
