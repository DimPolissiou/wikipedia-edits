Tile is a manufactured piece of hard-wearing material such as [[ceramic]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], metal, baked clay, or even [[glass]], generally used for covering roofs, floors, walls, or other objects such as tabletops.  Alternatively, tile can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as [[perlite]], [[wood]], and [[mineral wool]], typically used for wall and ceiling applications. In another sense, a tile is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see [[tile-based game]]). The word is derived from the [[French Language|French]] word ''tuile'', which is, in turn, from the [[Latin Language|Latin]] word ''tegula'', meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay.\n\nTiles are often used to form wall and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex or [[mosaic]]s.  Tiles are most often made of [[pottery|ceramic]], typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, [[concrete]] and other composite materials, and stone. Tiling stone is typically marble, onyx, granite or slate. Thinner tiles can be used on walls than on floors, which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts.\n\n== Decorative tile work and coloured brick ==\n[[File:Grande Maison de Blanc Fleurs.JPG|thumb|[[Art Nouveau]] tiles in [[Bruxelles]] ([[Belgium]])]]\n\nDecorative tilework or [[tile art]] should be distinguished from [[mosaic]], where forms are made of great numbers of tiny irregularly positioned [[tesserae]], each of a single color, usually of glass or sometimes ceramic or stone.\n\n== History ==\n{{globalize|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Ancient Middle East===\nThe earliest evidence of glazed brick is the discovery of glazed bricks in the [[Elamite language|Elamite]] Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC. Glazed and colored bricks were used to make low reliefs in Ancient [[Mesopotamia]], most famously the [[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] (ca. 575 BC), now partly reconstructed in [[Berlin]], with sections elsewhere. Mesopotamian craftsmen were imported for the palaces of the [[Persian Empire]] such as [[Persepolis]].\n\nThe use of sun-dried bricks or adobe was the main method of building in [[Mesopotamia]] where river mud was found in abundance along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]. Here the scarcity of stone may have been an incentive to develop the technology of making kiln-fired bricks to use as an alternative. To strengthen walls made from sun-dried bricks, fired bricks began to be used as an outer protective skin for more important buildings like temples, palaces, city walls and gates. Making fired bricks is an advanced pottery technique. Fired bricks are solid masses of [[clay]] heated in kilns to temperatures of between 950\u00b0 and 1,150\u00b0[[Celsius|C]], and a well-made fired brick is an extremely durable object. Like sun-dried bricks they were made in wooden molds but for bricks with relief decorations special molds had to be made.\n\n=== Ancient Indian subcontinent ===\nRooms with tiled floors made of clay decorated with geometric circular patterns have been discovered from the ancient remains of [[Kalibangan]], [[Kot Bala|Balakot]] and Ahladino<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.202140|quote=kalibangan tiles.|title=Indian History|year=1926|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259063237|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218&dq=balakot+tiles+indus+valley&source=bl&ots=jcjUAvvfQ1&sig=eBjMQ80bDuX8BiWjyb6_VdkPPEU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjY9MTI_PHcAhVJYo8KHWZ6A8IQ6AEwDnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=balakot%20tiles%20indus%20valley&f=false|title=The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives|last=McIntosh|first=Jane|date=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576079072|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTiling was used in the second century by the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] kings of ancient [[Sri Lanka]], using smoothed and polished stone laid on floors and in swimming pools.

First half of the 15th century, [[Shah-i-Zinda]]]]\nThe golden age of Persian tilework began during the [[Timurid Empire]]. In the [[moraq]] technique, single-color tiles were cut into small geometric pieces and assembled by pouring liquid plaster between them. After hardening, these panels were assembled on the walls of buildings. But the mosaic was not limited to flat areas. Tiles were used to cover both the interior and exterior surfaces of domes. Prominent Timurid examples of this technique include the [[Jame mosque of Yazd|Jame Mosque]] of [[Yazd]] (AD 1324\u20131365), [[Goharshad Mosque]] (AD 1418), the Madrassa of Khan in Shiraz (AD 1615), and the [[Molana Mosque]] (AD 1444).<ref name=\"HistoryOfIranianTile\" />\n\nOther important tile techniques of this time include [[girih tiles]], with their characteristic white girih, or straps.\n\n[[Mihrab]]s, being the focal points of mosques, were usually the places where most sophisticated tilework was placed. The 14th-century mihrab at Madrasa Imami in [[Isfahan]] is an outstanding example of aesthetic union between the [[Islamic calligraphy|Islamic calligrapher's art]] and abstract ornament. The [[Ogive#Architecture|pointed arch]], framing the mihrab's niche, bears an inscription in Kufic script used in 9th-century [[Qur'an]].<ref name=\"Gardner\">{{cite book\n| title  = Gardner's Art Through The Ages, A Global History\n| author = Fred S.

Its dome is a prime example of tile mosaic and its winter praying hall houses one of the finest ensembles of ''[[cuerda seca]]'' tiles in the world. A wide variety of tiles had to be manufactured in order to cover complex forms of the hall with consistent mosaic patterns. The result was a technological triumph as well as a dazzling display of abstract ornament.<ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\nDuring the [[Safavid Empire|Safavid period]], mosaic ornaments were often replaced by a ''haft rang'' (seven colors) technique. Pictures were painted on plain rectangle tiles, glazed and fired afterwards. Besides economic reasons, the seven colors method gave more freedom to artists and was less time-consuming. It was popular until the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar period]], when the palette of colors was extended by yellow and orange.<ref name=\"HistoryOfIranianTile\" /> The seven colors of Haft Rang tiles were usually [[black]], [[white]], [[ultramarine]], [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[red]], [[yellow]] and [[Fawn (colour)|fawn]].\n\n[[File:001117 15-44-2002-To-grupper-rosa-Qajar-Fliser2.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Two panels of [[earthenware]] tiles painted with [[polychrome]] [[Ceramic glaze|glazes]] over a white glaze. (Iran 19thC)]]\nThe [[Persianate]] tradition continued and spread to much of the Islamic world, notably the [[\u0130znik pottery]] of [[Turkey]] under the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Palaces, public buildings, [[mosque]]s and [[t\u00fcrbe]] mausoleums were heavily decorated with large brightly colored patterns, typically with floral motifs, and [[frieze]]s of astonishing complexity, including floral motifs and calligraphy as well as geometric patterns.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nTile at Topkapi Palace Istanbul.jpg|Tile in the [[Topkapi Palace]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]\nEnderun library Topkapi 42.JPG|Enderun library, Topkapi Palace\nWindow Apartments of the Crown Prince.JPG|Window Apartments of the Crown Prince, Topkapi Palace\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Nadir Madrasah Phoenix.JPG|thumb|Phoenix on the portal of Nadir Divan-Beghi Madrasah, [[Bukhara]], [[Uzbekistan]]]]\nIslamic buildings in [[Bukhara]] in central Asia (16th-17th century) also exhibit very sophisticated floral ornaments. In [[South Asia]] monuments and shrines adorned with [[Qashani|Kashi]] tile work from Persia became a distinct feature of the shrines of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]]. The [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore stands out as one of the masterpieces of Kashi time work from the [[Mughal period]].\n\n[[File:Mekhnes Place El-Hedine Mosaique2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zellige]] tilework in the [[Palace El-Hedine]], [[Meknes]], [[Morocco]]]]\nThe [[zellige]] tradition of Arabic [[North Africa]] uses small colored tiles of various shapes to make very complex geometric patterns. It is halfway to mosaic, but as the different shapes must be fitted precisely together, it falls under tiling. The use of small coloured glass fields also make it rather like [[enamelling]], but with ceramic rather than metal as the support.\n\n[[File:WindowCrestAzulejos.JPG|thumb|right|[[Casa de los Azulejos]], [[Mexico City]], 18th century, with [[azulejo]]s]]\n[[Azulejo]]s are derived from [[zellige]], and the name is likewise derived. The term is both a simple Portuguese and Spanish term for zellige, and a term for later tilework following the tradition. Some azujelos are small-scale geometric patterns or vegetative motifs, some are blue monochrome and highly pictorial, and some are neither. The [[Baroque]] period produced extremely large painted scenes on tiles, usually in blue and white, for walls. [[Azulejo]]s were also used in Latin American architecture.\n\n<gallery>\nBeja26.jpg|[[Quadra (architecture)]] of [[St. John the Baptist]] covered with azulejos in carpet style (17th c.); [[Museu da Reinha D.

Religious and secular stories were depicted. The imaginary tiles with [[Old Testament]] scenes shown on the floor in [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|''Annunciation'' in Washington]] are an example.

Several 18th century royal palaces had porcelain rooms with the walls entirely covered in porcelain in tiles or panels.  Surviving examples include ones at [[Museo di Capodimonte|Capodimonte]], Naples, the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] and the nearby [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]].\n\n=== Far East ===\nThere are several other types of traditional tiles that remain in manufacture, for example the small, almost mosaic, brightly colored zellige tiles of [[Morocco]] and the surrounding countries. With exceptions, notably the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing]], decorated tiles or glazed bricks do not feature largely in East Asian ceramics.\n[[File:Demorganducks.jpg|right|thumb|[[William de Morgan]], fantastic ducks on 6-inch tile with luster highlights, Fulham period]]\n\n=== Modern Europe ===\nThe Victorian period saw a great revival in tilework, largely as part of the [[Gothic Revival]], but also the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]]. Patterned tiles, or tiles making up patterns, were now mass-produced by machine and reliably level for floors and cheap to produce, especially for churches, schools and public buildings, but also for domestic hallways and bathrooms. For many uses the tougher [[encaustic tile]] was used. Wall tiles in various styles also revived; the rise of the bathroom contributing greatly to this, as well as greater appreciation of the benefit of [[hygiene]] in kitchens. [[William De Morgan]] was the leading English designer working in tiles, strongly influenced by Islamic designs.\n\nSince the Victorian period tiles have remained standard for kitchens and bathrooms, and many types of public area.\n\n[[File:Quiosco modernista Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A late [[Art Nouveau]] kiosk (1923) in [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] covered with tiles from [[Manises]], Spain.]]\n\nPortugal and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]] continue their tradition of ''azulejo'' tilework today, with [[azulejo]]s used to decorate buildings, ships,<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://installationmag.com/trafaria-praia-on-the-waterfront/\n| title       = Archived copy\n| accessdate  = 18 August 2016\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170109050534/http://installationmag.com/trafaria-praia-on-the-waterfront/\n| archivedate = 9 January 2017\n}}</ref> and even rocks.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Casa da M\u00fasica.

Modern materials such as [[concrete]], glass and [[plastic]] are also used and some clay tiles have a waterproof glaze. A large number of shapes (or \"profiles\") of roof tiles have evolved.\n\n== Floor tiles ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Symmetry]] -->\n[[File:Making mosaic tiles.webm|thumb|Making mosaic tiles]]\n[[File:QVB mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|The elaborate floor pattern of the Sydney [[Queen Victoria Building]]]]\n[[File:Cyprus floor tile.jpg|thumb|right|Floor tile in Karpas, northeastern [[Cyprus]]]]\n[[File:6\"x6\" porcelain floor tiles.jpg|thumb|right|6\"x6\" porcelain floor tiles]]\n[[File:Stone tile patio, Hawaii, 1960.JPG|thumb|left|[[Patio]] with stone tile, [[Hawaii]], US 1960]]\nThese are commonly made of ceramic or stone, although recent technological advances have resulted in rubber or [[glass tiles]] for floors as well. Ceramic tiles may be painted and glazed. Small mosaic tiles may be laid in various patterns. Floor tiles are typically set into [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] consisting of [[sand]], [[cement]] and often a [[latex]] additive for extra adhesion. The spaces between the tiles are commonly filled with sanded or unsanded floor [[grout]], but traditionally mortar was used.\n\nNatural stone tiles can be beautiful but as a natural product they are less uniform in color and pattern, and require more planning for use and installation. Mass-produced stone tiles are uniform in width and length. Granite or marble tiles are sawn on both sides and then polished or finished on the top surface so that they have a uniform thickness. Other natural stone tiles such as slate are typically \"riven\" (split) on the top surface so that the thickness of the tile varies slightly from one spot on the tile to another and from one tile to another. Variations in tile thickness can be handled by adjusting the amount of mortar under each part of the tile, by using wide grout lines that \"ramp\" between different thicknesses, or by using a cold chisel to knock off high spots.\n\nSome stone tiles such as polished granite, marble, and travertine are very slippery when wet. Stone tiles with a riven (split) surface such as slate or with a sawn and then sandblasted or honed surface will be more slip-resistant. Ceramic tiles for use in wet areas can be made more slip-resistant either by using very small tiles so that the grout lines acts as grooves or by imprinting a contour pattern onto the face of the tile.\n\nThe hardness of natural stone tiles varies such that some of the softer stone (e.g. limestone) tiles are not suitable for very heavy-traffic floor areas. On the other hand, ceramic tiles typically have a glazed upper surface and when that becomes scratched or pitted the floor looks worn, whereas the same amount of wear on natural stone tiles will not show, or will be less noticeable.\n\nNatural stone tiles can be stained by spilled liquids; they must be sealed and periodically resealed with a sealant in contrast to ceramic tiles which only need their grout lines sealed. However, because of the complex, nonrepeating patterns in natural stone, small amounts of dirt on many natural stone floor tiles do not show.\n\nThe tendency of floor tiles to stain depends not only on a sealant being applied, and periodically reapplied, but also on their porosity or how porous the stone is. Slate is an example of a less porous stone while limestone is an example of a more porous stone. Different granites and marbles have different porosities with the less porous ones being more valued and more expensive.\n\nMost vendors of stone tiles emphasize that there will be variation in color and pattern from one batch of tiles to another of the same description and variation within the same batch. Stone floor tiles tend to be heavier than ceramic tiles and somewhat more prone to breakage during shipment.\n\nRubber floor tiles have a variety of uses, both in residential and commercial settings. They are especially useful in situations where it is desired to have high-traction floors or protection for an easily breakable floor. Some common uses include flooring of garage, workshops, patios, swimming pool decks, sport courts, gyms, and dance floors.\n\nPlastic floor tiles including interlocking floor tiles that can be installed without adhesive or glue are a recent innovation and are suitable for areas subject to heavy traffic, wet areas and floors that are subject to movement, damp or contamination from oil, grease or other substances that may prevent adhesion to the substrate. Common uses include old factory floors, garages, gyms and sports complexes, schools and shops.\n\n== Ceiling tiles ==\n{{main|Ceiling tile}}\nCeiling tiles are lightweight tiles used inside buildings. They are placed in an aluminium grid; they provide little thermal insulation but are generally designed either to improve the acoustics of a room or to reduce the volume of air being heated or cooled.\n\nMineral fiber tiles are fabricated from a range of products; wet felt tiles can be manufactured from perlite, mineral wool, and fibers from recycled paper; stone wool tiles are created by combining molten stone and binders which is then spun to create the tile; gypsum tiles are based on the soft mineral and then finished with vinyl, paper or a decorative face.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nCeiling tiles very often have patterns on the front face; these are there in most circumstances to aid with the tiles ability to improve acoustics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nCeiling tiles also provide a barrier to the spread of smoke and fire. Breaking, displacing, or removing ceiling tiles enables hot gases and smoke from a fire to rise and accumulate above detectors and sprinklers. Doing so delays their activation, enabling fires to grow more rapidly.<ref>[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo16742 Missing Ceiling Tiles.] Washington, D.C.: [[United States Congress Office of Compliance]], 2008.</ref>\n\nCeiling tiles, especially in old Mediterranean houses, were made of terracotta and were placed on top of the wooden ceiling beams and upon those were placed the roof tiles. They were then plastered or painted, but nowadays are usually left bare for decorative purposes.\n\nModern-day tile ceilings may be flush mounted (nail up or glue up) or installed as [[dropped ceiling]]s.\n\n== Materials and processes ==\n=== Ceramic ===\nCeramic materials for tiles include [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]] and [[porcelain]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Terracotta]] is a traditional material used for roof tiles.<ref>{{Cite book\n| url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=xaKWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA271\n| title       = Environmentally Friendly Cities: Proceedings of Plea 1998, Passive and Low Energy Architecture, 1998, Lisbon, Portugal, June 1998\n| last        = Maldonado\n| first       = Eduardo\n| date        = 19 November 2014\n| publisher   = Routledge\n| isbn        = 978-1-134-25622-8\n| language    = en\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180506165629/https://books.google.com/books?id=xaKWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA271&dq=Terracotta+is+a+traditional+material+used+for+roof+tiles.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi49vD_h93XAhUN0mMKHUFrA9gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Terracotta%20is%20a%20traditional%20material%20used%20for%20roof%20tiles.&f=false\n| archivedate = 6 May 2018\n}}</ref>\n\n==== Porcelain tiles ====\n{{Main|Porcelain tile}}\n\nThis is a US term, and defined in [[ASTM]] standard C242 as a ceramic mosaic tile or paver that is generally made by dust-pressing and of a composition yielding a tile that is dense, fine-grained, and smooth, with sharply-formed face, usually impervious.

Tile is a manufactured piece of hard-wearing material such as [[ceramic]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], metal, baked clay, or even [[glass]], generally used for covering roofs, floors, walls, or other objects such as tabletops.  Alternatively, tile can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as [[perlite]], [[wood]], and [[mineral wool]], typically used for wall and ceiling applications. In another sense, a tile is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see [[tile-based game]]). The word is derived from the [[French Language|French]] word ''tuile'', which is, in turn, from the [[Latin Language|Latin]] word ''tegula'', meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay.\n\nTiles are often used to form wall and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex or [[mosaic]]s.  Tiles are most often made of [[pottery|ceramic]], typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, [[concrete]] and other composite materials, and stone. Tiling stone is typically marble, onyx, granite or slate. Thinner tiles can be used on walls than on floors, which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts.\n\n== Decorative tile work and coloured brick ==\n[[File:Grande Maison de Blanc Fleurs.JPG|thumb|[[Art Nouveau]] tiles in [[Bruxelles]] ([[Belgium]])]]\n\nDecorative tilework or [[tile art]] should be distinguished from [[mosaic]], where forms are made of great numbers of tiny irregularly positioned [[tesserae]], each of a single color, usually of glass or sometimes ceramic or stone.\n\n== History ==\n{{globalize|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Ancient Middle East===\nThe earliest evidence of glazed brick is the discovery of glazed bricks in the [[Elamite language|Elamite]] Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC. Glazed and colored bricks were used to make low reliefs in Ancient [[Mesopotamia]], most famously the [[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] (ca. 575 BC), now partly reconstructed in [[Berlin]], with sections elsewhere. Mesopotamian craftsmen were imported for the palaces of the [[Persian Empire]] such as [[Persepolis]].\n\nThe use of sun-dried bricks or adobe was the main method of building in [[Mesopotamia]] where river mud was found in abundance along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]. Here the scarcity of stone may have been an incentive to develop the technology of making kiln-fired bricks to use as an alternative. To strengthen walls made from sun-dried bricks, fired bricks began to be used as an outer protective skin for more important buildings like temples, palaces, city walls and gates. Making fired bricks is an advanced pottery technique. Fired bricks are solid masses of [[clay]] heated in kilns to temperatures of between 950\u00b0 and 1,150\u00b0[[Celsius|C]], and a well-made fired brick is an extremely durable object. Like sun-dried bricks they were made in wooden molds but for bricks with relief decorations special molds had to be made.\n\n=== Ancient Indian subcontinent ===\nRooms with tiled floors made of clay decorated with geometric circular patterns have been discovered from the ancient remains of [[Kalibangan]], [[Kot Bala|Balakot]] and Ahladino<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.202140|quote=kalibangan tiles.|title=Indian History|year=1926|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259063237|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218&dq=balakot+tiles+indus+valley&source=bl&ots=jcjUAvvfQ1&sig=eBjMQ80bDuX8BiWjyb6_VdkPPEU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjY9MTI_PHcAhVJYo8KHWZ6A8IQ6AEwDnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=balakot%20tiles%20indus%20valley&f=false|title=The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives|last=McIntosh|first=Jane|date=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576079072|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTiling was used in the second century by the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] kings of ancient [[Sri Lanka]], using smoothed and polished stone laid on floors and in swimming pools.

First half of the 15th century, [[Shah-i-Zinda]]]]\nThe golden age of Persian tilework began during the [[Timurid Empire]]. In the [[moraq]] technique, single-color tiles were cut into small geometric pieces and assembled by pouring liquid plaster between them. After hardening, these panels were assembled on the walls of buildings. But the mosaic was not limited to flat areas. Tiles were used to cover both the interior and exterior surfaces of domes. Prominent Timurid examples of this technique include the [[Jame mosque of Yazd|Jame Mosque]] of [[Yazd]] (AD 1324\u20131365), [[Goharshad Mosque]] (AD 1418), the Madrassa of Khan in Shiraz (AD 1615), and the [[Molana Mosque]] (AD 1444).<ref name=\"HistoryOfIranianTile\" />\n\nOther important tile techniques of this time include [[girih tiles]], with their characteristic white girih, or straps.\n\n[[Mihrab]]s, being the focal points of mosques, were usually the places where most sophisticated tilework was placed. The 14th-century mihrab at Madrasa Imami in [[Isfahan]] is an outstanding example of aesthetic union between the [[Islamic calligraphy|Islamic calligrapher's art]] and abstract ornament. The [[Ogive#Architecture|pointed arch]], framing the mihrab's niche, bears an inscription in Kufic script used in 9th-century [[Qur'an]].<ref name=\"Gardner\">{{cite book\n| title  = Gardner's Art Through The Ages, A Global History\n| author = Fred S.

Its dome is a prime example of tile mosaic and its winter praying hall houses one of the finest ensembles of ''[[cuerda seca]]'' tiles in the world. A wide variety of tiles had to be manufactured in order to cover complex forms of the hall with consistent mosaic patterns. The result was a technological triumph as well as a dazzling display of abstract ornament.<ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\nDuring the [[Safavid Empire|Safavid period]], mosaic ornaments were often replaced by a ''haft rang'' (seven colors) technique. Pictures were painted on plain rectangle tiles, glazed and fired afterwards. Besides economic reasons, the seven colors method gave more freedom to artists and was less time-consuming. It was popular until the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar period]], when the palette of colors was extended by yellow and orange.<ref name=\"HistoryOfIranianTile\" /> The seven colors of Haft Rang tiles were usually [[black]], [[white]], [[ultramarine]], [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[red]], [[yellow]] and [[Fawn (colour)|fawn]].\n\n[[File:001117 15-44-2002-To-grupper-rosa-Qajar-Fliser2.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Two panels of [[earthenware]] tiles painted with [[polychrome]] [[Ceramic glaze|glazes]] over a white glaze. (Iran 19thC)]]\nThe [[Persianate]] tradition continued and spread to much of the Islamic world, notably the [[\u0130znik pottery]] of [[Turkey]] under the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Palaces, public buildings, [[mosque]]s and [[t\u00fcrbe]] mausoleums were heavily decorated with large brightly colored patterns, typically with floral motifs, and [[frieze]]s of astonishing complexity, including floral motifs and calligraphy as well as geometric patterns.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nTile at Topkapi Palace Istanbul.jpg|Tile in the [[Topkapi Palace]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]\nEnderun library Topkapi 42.JPG|Enderun library, Topkapi Palace\nWindow Apartments of the Crown Prince.JPG|Window Apartments of the Crown Prince, Topkapi Palace\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Nadir Madrasah Phoenix.JPG|thumb|Phoenix on the portal of Nadir Divan-Beghi Madrasah, [[Bukhara]], [[Uzbekistan]]]]\nIslamic buildings in [[Bukhara]] in central Asia (16th-17th century) also exhibit very sophisticated floral ornaments. In [[South Asia]] monuments and shrines adorned with [[Qashani|Kashi]] tile work from Persia became a distinct feature of the shrines of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]]. The [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore stands out as one of the masterpieces of Kashi time work from the [[Mughal period]].\n\n[[File:Mekhnes Place El-Hedine Mosaique2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zellige]] tilework in the [[Palace El-Hedine]], [[Meknes]], [[Morocco]]]]\nThe [[zellige]] tradition of Arabic [[North Africa]] uses small colored tiles of various shapes to make very complex geometric patterns. It is halfway to mosaic, but as the different shapes must be fitted precisely together, it falls under tiling. The use of small coloured glass fields also make it rather like [[enamelling]], but with ceramic rather than metal as the support.\n\n[[File:WindowCrestAzulejos.JPG|thumb|right|[[Casa de los Azulejos]], [[Mexico City]], 18th century, with [[azulejo]]s]]\n[[Azulejo]]s are derived from [[zellige]], and the name is likewise derived. The term is both a simple Portuguese and Spanish term for zellige, and a term for later tilework following the tradition. Some azujelos are small-scale geometric patterns or vegetative motifs, some are blue monochrome and highly pictorial, and some are neither. The [[Baroque]] period produced extremely large painted scenes on tiles, usually in blue and white, for walls. [[Azulejo]]s were also used in Latin American architecture.\n\n<gallery>\nBeja26.jpg|[[Quadra (architecture)]] of [[St. John the Baptist]] covered with azulejos in carpet style (17th c.); [[Museu da Reinha D.

Religious and secular stories were depicted. The imaginary tiles with [[Old Testament]] scenes shown on the floor in [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|''Annunciation'' in Washington]] are an example.

Several 18th century royal palaces had porcelain rooms with the walls entirely covered in porcelain in tiles or panels.  Surviving examples include ones at [[Museo di Capodimonte|Capodimonte]], Naples, the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] and the nearby [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]].\n\n=== Far East ===\nThere are several other types of traditional tiles that remain in manufacture, for example the small, almost mosaic, brightly colored zellige tiles of [[Morocco]] and the surrounding countries. With exceptions, notably the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing]], decorated tiles or glazed bricks do not feature largely in East Asian ceramics.\n[[File:Demorganducks.jpg|right|thumb|[[William de Morgan]], fantastic ducks on 6-inch tile with luster highlights, Fulham period]]\n\n=== Modern Europe ===\nThe Victorian period saw a great revival in tilework, largely as part of the [[Gothic Revival]], but also the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]]. Patterned tiles, or tiles making up patterns, were now mass-produced by machine and reliably level for floors and cheap to produce, especially for churches, schools and public buildings, but also for domestic hallways and bathrooms. For many uses the tougher [[encaustic tile]] was used. Wall tiles in various styles also revived; the rise of the bathroom contributing greatly to this, as well as greater appreciation of the benefit of [[hygiene]] in kitchens. [[William De Morgan]] was the leading English designer working in tiles, strongly influenced by Islamic designs.\n\nSince the Victorian period tiles have remained standard for kitchens and bathrooms, and many types of public area.\n\n[[File:Quiosco modernista Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A late [[Art Nouveau]] kiosk (1923) in [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] covered with tiles from [[Manises]], Spain.]]\n\nPortugal and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]] continue their tradition of ''azulejo'' tilework today, with [[azulejo]]s used to decorate buildings, ships,<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://installationmag.com/trafaria-praia-on-the-waterfront/\n| title       = Archived copy\n| accessdate  = 18 August 2016\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170109050534/http://installationmag.com/trafaria-praia-on-the-waterfront/\n| archivedate = 9 January 2017\n}}</ref> and even rocks.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Casa da M\u00fasica.

Modern materials such as [[concrete]], glass and [[plastic]] are also used and some clay tiles have a waterproof glaze. A large number of shapes (or \"profiles\") of roof tiles have evolved.\n\n== Floor tiles ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Symmetry]] -->\n[[File:Making mosaic tiles.webm|thumb|Making mosaic tiles]]\n[[File:QVB mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|The elaborate floor pattern of the Sydney [[Queen Victoria Building]]]]\n[[File:Cyprus floor tile.jpg|thumb|right|Floor tile in Karpas, northeastern [[Cyprus]]]]\n[[File:6\"x6\" porcelain floor tiles.jpg|thumb|right|6\"x6\" porcelain floor tiles]]\n[[File:Stone tile patio, Hawaii, 1960.JPG|thumb|left|[[Patio]] with stone tile, [[Hawaii]], US 1960]]\nThese are commonly made of ceramic or stone, although recent technological advances have resulted in rubber or [[glass tiles]] for floors as well. Ceramic tiles may be painted and glazed. Small mosaic tiles may be laid in various patterns. Floor tiles are typically set into [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] consisting of [[sand]], [[cement]] and often a [[latex]] additive for extra adhesion. The spaces between the tiles are commonly filled with sanded or unsanded floor [[grout]], but traditionally mortar was used.\n\nNatural stone tiles can be beautiful but as a natural product they are less uniform in color and pattern, and require more planning for use and installation. Mass-produced stone tiles are uniform in width and length. Granite or marble tiles are sawn on both sides and then polished or finished on the top surface so that they have a uniform thickness. Other natural stone tiles such as slate are typically \"riven\" (split) on the top surface so that the thickness of the tile varies slightly from one spot on the tile to another and from one tile to another. Variations in tile thickness can be handled by adjusting the amount of mortar under each part of the tile, by using wide grout lines that \"ramp\" between different thicknesses, or by using a cold chisel to knock off high spots.\n\nSome stone tiles such as polished granite, marble, and travertine are very slippery when wet. Stone tiles with a riven (split) surface such as slate or with a sawn and then sandblasted or honed surface will be more slip-resistant. Ceramic tiles for use in wet areas can be made more slip-resistant either by using very small tiles so that the grout lines acts as grooves or by imprinting a contour pattern onto the face of the tile.\n\nThe hardness of natural stone tiles varies such that some of the softer stone (e.g. limestone) tiles are not suitable for very heavy-traffic floor areas. On the other hand, ceramic tiles typically have a glazed upper surface and when that becomes scratched or pitted the floor looks worn, whereas the same amount of wear on natural stone tiles will not show, or will be less noticeable.\n\nNatural stone tiles can be stained by spilled liquids; they must be sealed and periodically resealed with a sealant in contrast to ceramic tiles which only need their grout lines sealed. However, because of the complex, nonrepeating patterns in natural stone, small amounts of dirt on many natural stone floor tiles do not show.\n\nThe tendency of floor tiles to stain depends not only on a sealant being applied, and periodically reapplied, but also on their porosity or how porous the stone is. Slate is an example of a less porous stone while limestone is an example of a more porous stone. Different granites and marbles have different porosities with the less porous ones being more valued and more expensive.\n\nMost vendors of stone tiles emphasize that there will be variation in color and pattern from one batch of tiles to another of the same description and variation within the same batch. Stone floor tiles tend to be heavier than ceramic tiles and somewhat more prone to breakage during shipment.\n\nRubber floor tiles have a variety of uses, both in residential and commercial settings. They are especially useful in situations where it is desired to have high-traction floors or protection for an easily breakable floor. Some common uses include flooring of garage, workshops, patios, swimming pool decks, sport courts, gyms, and dance floors.\n\nPlastic floor tiles including interlocking floor tiles that can be installed without adhesive or glue are a recent innovation and are suitable for areas subject to heavy traffic, wet areas and floors that are subject to movement, damp or contamination from oil, grease or other substances that may prevent adhesion to the substrate. Common uses include old factory floors, garages, gyms and sports complexes, schools and shops.\n\n== Ceiling tiles ==\n{{main|Ceiling tile}}\nCeiling tiles are lightweight tiles used inside buildings. They are placed in an aluminium grid; they provide little thermal insulation but are generally designed either to improve the acoustics of a room or to reduce the volume of air being heated or cooled.\n\nMineral fiber tiles are fabricated from a range of products; wet felt tiles can be manufactured from perlite, mineral wool, and fibers from recycled paper; stone wool tiles are created by combining molten stone and binders which is then spun to create the tile; gypsum tiles are based on the soft mineral and then finished with vinyl, paper or a decorative face.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nCeiling tiles very often have patterns on the front face; these are there in most circumstances to aid with the tiles ability to improve acoustics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nCeiling tiles also provide a barrier to the spread of smoke and fire. Breaking, displacing, or removing ceiling tiles enables hot gases and smoke from a fire to rise and accumulate above detectors and sprinklers. Doing so delays their activation, enabling fires to grow more rapidly.<ref>[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo16742 Missing Ceiling Tiles.] Washington, D.C.: [[United States Congress Office of Compliance]], 2008.</ref>\n\nCeiling tiles, especially in old Mediterranean houses, were made of terracotta and were placed on top of the wooden ceiling beams and upon those were placed the roof tiles. They were then plastered or painted, but nowadays are usually left bare for decorative purposes.\n\nModern-day tile ceilings may be flush mounted (nail up or glue up) or installed as [[dropped ceiling]]s.\n\n== Materials and processes ==\n=== Ceramic ===\nCeramic materials for tiles include [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]] and [[porcelain]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Terracotta]] is a traditional material used for roof tiles.<ref>{{Cite book\n| url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=xaKWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA271\n| title       = Environmentally Friendly Cities: Proceedings of Plea 1998, Passive and Low Energy Architecture, 1998, Lisbon, Portugal, June 1998\n| last        = Maldonado\n| first       = Eduardo\n| date        = 19 November 2014\n| publisher   = Routledge\n| isbn        = 978-1-134-25622-8\n| language    = en\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180506165629/https://books.google.com/books?id=xaKWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA271&dq=Terracotta+is+a+traditional+material+used+for+roof+tiles.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi49vD_h93XAhUN0mMKHUFrA9gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Terracotta%20is%20a%20traditional%20material%20used%20for%20roof%20tiles.&f=false\n| archivedate = 6 May 2018\n}}</ref>\n\n==== Porcelain tiles ====\n{{Main|Porcelain tile}}\n\nThis is a US term, and defined in [[ASTM]] standard C242 as a ceramic mosaic tile or paver that is generally made by dust-pressing and of a composition yielding a tile that is dense, fine-grained, and smooth, with sharply-formed face, usually impervious.

The action was the first battle of the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1796\u20131808)|Anglo-Spanish War]], coming just eight days after the Spanish declaration of war. In a battle lasting an hour and forty minutes, ''Mahonesa'' was captured.\n\nSpain had been an ally of Britain in the first years of the [[War of the First Coalition]] against the newly formed [[First French Republic|French Republic]]. Relations between the allies had often been strained, and following a series of defeats in the [[War of the Pyrenees]] the Spanish signed a peace treaty in August 1795. A year later the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] brought Spain back into the war, now as an ally of France. The war in the Mediterranean had reached a stalemate after two inconclusive battles in the spring of 1795, with a British [[blockade]] of the French naval base at [[Toulon]] maintained from [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|San Fiorenzo]] and [[Livorno|Leghorn]] under Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl St Vincent|Sir John Jervis]]. The French dominance in the [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|Italian campaign]] of 1796 made the British position tenuous, and with Spain's entry into the war Jervis was forced to disperse his limited forces further still, with forces watching Spanish shipping at [[C\u00e1diz]].\n\nOff Cartagena Bowen commanded the small frigate ''Terpsichore'', which had been shadowing a large Spanish fleet which had left C\u00e1diz a few days earlier. As he returned to [[Gibraltar]] Bowen encountered ''Mahonesa'', and the Spanish captain Ayalde offered battle. Bowen accepted and the ships fought an extended engagement at close quarters. The Spanish ship took much more serious damage and casualties than the British, and gradually the crew began to slip away from their guns. Ayalde made an attempt to escape, but his ship was too crippled and after a chase of 20 minutes he surrendered. Bowen brought the [[prize (ship)|prize]] to [[Lisbon]], where the damage was revealed to be too severe to repair. Bowen served in a number of engagements off C\u00e1diz in the following months, until he was killed in July 1797 at the [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Battle of Santa Cruz]].\n\n==Background==\nIn early 1793 [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], historic antagonists in the Mediterranean, found themselves allies against the newly-formed [[First French Republic|French Republic]] in the [[War of the First Coalition]].<ref name=\"BI144\"/> The alliance was uneasy, the Spanish refusing to allow British officers to command Spanish forces,<ref name=\"BI144\">Ireland, p.144</ref> and suspicious of British motives in the aftermath of the [[Nootka Crisis]] of 1790.<ref name=\"NM97\">Mostert, p.97</ref> During the [[Siege of Toulon]], Spanish Admiral [[Juan de L\u00e1ngara]] threatened to open fire on [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], the flagship of British Vice-Admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]] during a dispute over strategy,<ref name=\"NM113\">Mostert, p. 113</ref> and at the culmination of the siege Spanish forces were accused of deliberately sabotaging a British attempt to destroy the French Mediterranean Fleet at anchor in harbour.<ref name=\"WLC212\">Clowes, p.212</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed the Spanish suffered a series of defeats on land in the [[War of the Pyrenees]], and in the summer of 1795 Spain was forced to sign a peace treaty with the French, withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean campaign.<ref name=\"RG89\">Gardiner, p.89</ref> Britain and France fought inconclusive sea battles at [[Battle of Genoa (1795)|Genoa]] and the [[Battle of the Hy\u00e8res Islands|Hy\u00e8res Islands]] that year, the campaign settling into a stalemate,<ref name=\"RG116\">Gardiner, p.116</ref> with the French [[blockade]]d in Toulon but sending successful raiding squadrons against British trade.<ref name=\"WJ273\">James, p.273</ref> One such squadron destroyed a large British convoy at the [[Battle of the Levant Convoy]] off [[Cape St. Vincent]] in October 1795 and took shelter in the main Spanish naval base of [[C\u00e1diz]].<ref name=\"WLC277\">Clowes, p.277</ref> During 1796 the [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|Italian campaigns]] of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] systematically eliminated Britain's Italian allies,<ref name=\"NM182\">Mostert, p.182</ref> while diplomatic negotiations brought Spain into an alliance with France, signing the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] in August. On 5 October Spain declared war on Britain and a large Spanish fleet sailed from C\u00e1diz under L\u00e1ngara to unite with the French at Toulon.<ref name=\"NM184\">Mostert, p.184</ref>\n\nBritish forces in the Mediterranean were commanded by Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl St Vincent|Sir John Jervis]], who had stationed forces off C\u00e1diz to watch for Spanish movement in the advent of war.<ref name=\"NM184\"/> The squadron at C\u00e1diz, commanded by Rear-Admiral [[Robert Mann (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Mann]], was chased by L\u00e1ngara's fleet, abandoning two storeships in its precipitate withdrawal.<ref name=\"WLC286\">Clowes, p.286</ref> Initially anchoring at [[Gibraltar]], Mann then deserted his post and returned to Britain against orders.<ref name=\"NM185\">Mostert, p.185</ref> One of the independent commands in the region was a small force led by the small 32-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Terpsichore|1785|6}} under Captain [[Richard Bowen (Royal Navy)|Richard Bowen]], recently transferred from the [[North Sea]] command at Jervis' request. Bowen recognised the danger in Mann's desertion, and set sail for the [[Ligurian Sea]] to warn Jervis of L\u00e1ngara's approach.<ref name=\"Campbell79\"/>\n\n==Action==\nOn 11 October, L\u00e1ngara reached the Spanish Mediterranean [[port of Cartagena]], uniting with the squadron there and sailing in search of Jervis.<ref name=\"WJ311\">James, p.311</ref> The previous day Bowen, having passed L\u00e1ngara's slower fleet, encountered {{HMS|Pallas|1793|6}} and passed the warning along, turning back to his station off Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Campbell79\">Campbell, p.79</ref> As L\u00e1ngara passed by, a Spanish frigate stationed in Cartagena, the 34-gun [[Spanish frigate Mahonesa|''Mahonesa'']] under Captain [[Tom\u00e1s de Ayalde]], sailed independently on a patrol and in the early morning of 13 October sighted a strange sail to the northeast.<ref name=\"WJ357\">James, p.357</ref> Ayalde brought his frigate towards the stranger to investigate and found that he faced Bowen's frigate, manoeuvering to position ''Mahonesa'' in an advantageous station to [[windward]].<ref name=\"WJ358\"/>\n\nBowen's ship was undermanned, having landed 30 men for medical treatment at Gibraltar and with another 30 on board unfit for action,<ref name=\"LG1\"/> and he was concerned that the Spanish fleet he was shadowing might appear at any moment; a Spanish [[Ship's tender|tender]] was seen sailing for Cartagena with news of Bowen's arrival.<ref name=\"WJ358\"/> Bowen however determined to fight, and stood towards Ayalde's ship. At 09:30, Bowen pulled close alongside the Spanish frigate and fired a single shot to see how the Spanish vessel would react.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=13954|pages=1133|date=22 November 1796}}</ref> Ayalde responded with a full [[broadside]], and the frigates traded heavy fire for the next hour and twenty minutes as they [[wearing (sailing)|wore around]] one another.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> ''Terpsichore''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s masts were badly damaged and the rigging, sails, boats and anchors badly torn up by Spanish fire, but casualties among the crew were relatively light.<ref name=\"WLC504\">Clowes, p.504</ref> ''Mahonesa'' however was badly battered, suffering heavy casualties; the [[Boom (sailing)|booms]] were shattered and the guns in the centre of the ship disabled.<ref name=\"WJ358\">James, p.358</ref>\n\nAs the action continued, Ayalde found that his men were slipping away from their guns and that fewer and fewer could be persuaded to return. Recognising that defeat was now inevitable, he ordered sails set and attempted to retreat to Cartagena.<ref name=\"WJ358\"/> On ''Terpsichore'', Bowen had his men effect rapid repairs and within 20 minutes the British frigate was under sail and soon overhauled the shattered Spanish ship.

The action was the first battle of the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1796\u20131808)|Anglo-Spanish War]], coming just eight days after the Spanish declaration of war. In a battle lasting an hour and forty minutes, ''Mahonesa'' was captured.\n\nSpain had been an ally of Britain in the first years of the [[War of the First Coalition]] against the newly formed [[First French Republic|French Republic]]. Relations between the allies had often been strained, and following a series of defeats in the [[War of the Pyrenees]] the Spanish signed a peace treaty in August 1795. A year later the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] brought Spain back into the war, now as an ally of France. The war in the Mediterranean had reached a stalemate after two inconclusive battles in the spring of 1795, with a British [[blockade]] of the French naval base at [[Toulon]] maintained from [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|San Fiorenzo]] and [[Livorno|Leghorn]] under Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl St Vincent|Sir John Jervis]]. The French dominance in the [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|Italian campaign]] of 1796 made the British position tenuous, and with Spain's entry into the war Jervis was forced to disperse his limited forces further still, with forces watching Spanish shipping at [[C\u00e1diz]].\n\nOff Cartagena Bowen commanded the small frigate ''Terpsichore'', which had been shadowing a large Spanish fleet which had left C\u00e1diz a few days earlier. As he returned to [[Gibraltar]] Bowen encountered ''Mahonesa'', and the Spanish captain Ayalde offered battle. Bowen accepted and the ships fought an extended engagement at close quarters. The Spanish ship took much more serious damage and casualties than the British, and gradually the crew began to slip away from their guns. Ayalde made an attempt to escape, but his ship was too crippled and after a chase of 20 minutes he surrendered. Bowen brought the [[prize (ship)|prize]] to [[Lisbon]], where the damage was revealed to be too severe to repair. Bowen served in a number of engagements off C\u00e1diz in the following months, until he was killed in July 1797 at the [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Battle of Santa Cruz]].\n\n==Background==\nIn early 1793 [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], historic antagonists in the Mediterranean, found themselves allies against the newly-formed [[First French Republic|French Republic]] in the [[War of the First Coalition]].<ref name=\"BI144\"/> The alliance was uneasy, the Spanish refusing to allow British officers to command Spanish forces,<ref name=\"BI144\">Ireland, p.144</ref> and suspicious of British motives in the aftermath of the [[Nootka Crisis]] of 1790.<ref name=\"NM97\">Mostert, p.97</ref> During the [[Siege of Toulon]], Spanish Admiral [[Juan de L\u00e1ngara]] threatened to open fire on [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], the flagship of British Vice-Admiral [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Lord Hood]] during a dispute over strategy,<ref name=\"NM113\">Mostert, p. 113</ref> and at the culmination of the siege Spanish forces were accused of deliberately sabotaging a British attempt to destroy the French Mediterranean Fleet at anchor in harbour.<ref name=\"WLC212\">Clowes, p.212</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed the Spanish suffered a series of defeats on land in the [[War of the Pyrenees]], and in the summer of 1795 Spain was forced to sign a peace treaty with the French, withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean campaign.<ref name=\"RG89\">Gardiner, p.89</ref> Britain and France fought inconclusive sea battles at [[Battle of Genoa (1795)|Genoa]] and the [[Battle of the Hy\u00e8res Islands|Hy\u00e8res Islands]] that year, the campaign settling into a stalemate,<ref name=\"RG116\">Gardiner, p.116</ref> with the French [[blockade]]d in Toulon but sending successful raiding squadrons against British trade.<ref name=\"WJ273\">James, p.273</ref> One such squadron destroyed a large British convoy at the [[Battle of the Levant Convoy]] off [[Cape St. Vincent]] in October 1795 and took shelter in the main Spanish naval base of [[C\u00e1diz]].<ref name=\"WLC277\">Clowes, p.277</ref> During 1796 the [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|Italian campaigns]] of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] systematically eliminated Britain's Italian allies,<ref name=\"NM182\">Mostert, p.182</ref> while diplomatic negotiations brought Spain into an alliance with France, signing the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] in August. On 5 October Spain declared war on Britain and a large Spanish fleet sailed from C\u00e1diz under L\u00e1ngara to unite with the French at Toulon.<ref name=\"NM184\">Mostert, p.184</ref>\n\nBritish forces in the Mediterranean were commanded by Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl St Vincent|Sir John Jervis]], who had stationed forces off C\u00e1diz to watch for Spanish movement in the advent of war.<ref name=\"NM184\"/> The squadron at C\u00e1diz, commanded by Rear-Admiral [[Robert Mann (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Mann]], was chased by L\u00e1ngara's fleet, abandoning two storeships in its precipitate withdrawal.<ref name=\"WLC286\">Clowes, p.286</ref> Initially anchoring at [[Gibraltar]], Mann then deserted his post and returned to Britain against orders.<ref name=\"NM185\">Mostert, p.185</ref> One of the independent commands in the region was a small force led by the small 32-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Terpsichore|1785|6}} under Captain [[Richard Bowen (Royal Navy)|Richard Bowen]], recently transferred from the [[North Sea]] command at Jervis' request. Bowen recognised the danger in Mann's desertion, and set sail for the [[Ligurian Sea]] to warn Jervis of L\u00e1ngara's approach.<ref name=\"Campbell79\"/>\n\n==Action==\nOn 11 October, L\u00e1ngara reached the Spanish Mediterranean [[port of Cartagena]], uniting with the squadron there and sailing in search of Jervis.<ref name=\"WJ311\">James, p.311</ref> The previous day Bowen, having passed L\u00e1ngara's slower fleet, encountered {{HMS|Pallas|1793|6}} and passed the warning along, turning back to his station off Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Campbell79\">Campbell, p.79</ref> As L\u00e1ngara passed by, a Spanish frigate stationed in Cartagena, the 34-gun [[Spanish frigate Mahonesa|''Mahonesa'']] under Captain [[Tom\u00e1s de Ayalde]], sailed independently on a patrol and in the early morning of 13 October sighted a strange sail to the northeast.<ref name=\"WJ357\">James, p.357</ref> Ayalde brought his frigate towards the stranger to investigate and found that he faced Bowen's frigate, manoeuvering to position ''Mahonesa'' in an advantageous station to [[windward]].<ref name=\"WJ358\"/>\n\nBowen's ship was undermanned, having landed 30 men for medical treatment at Gibraltar and with another 30 on board unfit for action,<ref name=\"LG1\"/> and he was concerned that the Spanish fleet he was shadowing might appear at any moment; a Spanish [[Ship's tender|tender]] was seen sailing for Cartagena with news of Bowen's arrival.<ref name=\"WJ358\"/> Bowen however determined to fight, and stood towards Ayalde's ship. At 09:30, Bowen pulled close alongside the Spanish frigate and fired a single shot to see how the Spanish vessel would react.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=13954|pages=1133|date=22 November 1796}}</ref> Ayalde responded with a full [[broadside]], and the frigates traded heavy fire for the next hour and twenty minutes as they [[wearing (sailing)|wore around]] one another.<ref name=\"LG1\"/> ''Terpsichore''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s masts were badly damaged and the rigging, sails, boats and anchors badly torn up by Spanish fire, but casualties among the crew were relatively light.<ref name=\"WLC504\">Clowes, p.504</ref> ''Mahonesa'' however was badly battered, suffering heavy casualties; the [[Boom (sailing)|booms]] were shattered and the guns in the centre of the ship disabled.<ref name=\"WJ358\">James, p.358</ref>\n\nAs the action continued, Ayalde found that his men were slipping away from their guns and that fewer and fewer could be persuaded to return. Recognising that defeat was now inevitable, he ordered sails set and attempted to retreat to Cartagena.<ref name=\"WJ358\"/> On ''Terpsichore'', Bowen had his men effect rapid repairs and within 20 minutes the British frigate was under sail and soon overhauled the shattered Spanish ship.

Whitaker, No. 18-2885 (7th Cir. Nov. 15, 2018)</ref> Courts did have the [[equitable power]] to enjoin defendants with regard to the plaintiff, but typically not the world at large.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 420 (2017)</ref> In cases where multiple parties had a common claim against the same defendant, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|British Chancellor]] sometimes offered a remedy known as a \u201c[[Bill of Peace|bill of peace]].\u201d<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv.

Some scholars have estimated that American federal courts issued a dozen national injunctions during this time, while others have estimated that American federal courts issued zero national injunctions during this time.<ref>Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen, Address at the Administrative Conference of the United States Forum on Nationwide Injunctions and Federal Regulatory Programs (Feb. 12, 2020).</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century, courts occasionally enjoined a municipality or county from enforcing a challenged tax or ordinance against nonparties. This was considered an extension of the \u201cbill of peace\u201d because it resolved a common claim by a small and cohesive group.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 427 (2017)</ref> The Supreme Court in ''[[Frothingham v.

Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 487 (1923)</ref>\n\nOne explanation for the lack of national injunctions is that the federal government itself waived its sovereign immunity from suit in 1976, while another is that venue and personal jurisdiction rules for a long time restricted litigants from suing cabinet officers outside of Washington, D.C. when seeking injunctions.<ref>Amici Curiae Legal Historians in Support of Plaintiff and Appellee the City of Chicago at 7, City of Chicago v.

Donald, 165 U.S. 107, 111 (1897)</ref> the Supreme Court held that \u201cwe are unable to wholly approve the decree entered in this case.\u201d<ref>Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 107, 115 (1897)</ref> The Court explained that \u201cthere may be others in like case with the plaintiff, and that such persons may be numerous, but such a state of facts is too conjectural to furnish a safe basis upon which a court of equity ought to grant an injunction.\u201d<ref>Scott v.

L.

Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 489 (1923)</ref>\n\n=== New Deal Challenges ===\nAfter the federal courts held numerous acts of [[New Deal]] legislation unconstitutional, they did not issue national injunctions.

Tracing equity practices at common law, Bray has argued that a federal court may only give an injunction that \"protects the plaintiff vis\u00e0-vis the defendant, wherever the plaintiff and the defendant may both happen to be.\"<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 469 (2017)</ref> It cannot \"constrain the defendant\u2019s conduct vis\u00e0-vis nonparties.\"<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 469 (2017)</ref> That is because, he argues, a federal court \"has no constitutional basis to decide disputes and issue remedies for those who are not parties.\"<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 471 (2017)</ref> Bray has noted that, among other problems, the current practice could lead to \"conflicting injunctions,\" a situation where multiple parties bring suit, one court orders a defendant not to apply a statute or regulation against anyone, and another court orders the same defendant to ignore the first injunction or to continue to implement the statute or regulation.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 462-64 (2017)</ref> Professor Michael Morley has written several articles on national injunctions.<ref>See Michael T. Morley, Nationwide Injunctions, Rule 23(B)(2), and the Remedial Powers of the Lower Courts, 97 B.U. L. Rev. 615, 622-23 (2017)</ref> He has argued that national injunctions through a national \"class action\" are \"presumptively inappropriate,\" but may be lawful when the plaintiffs are asserting clearly established rights, the plaintiffs' rights are indivisible, the plaintiffs' claims are based on the burdens of the unconstitutionality of the challenged provisions, and it would be inappropriate to issue a narrower injunction.<ref>Michael T. Morley, Nationwide Injunctions, Rule 23(B)(2), and the Remedial Powers of the Lower Courts, 97 B.U. L. Rev. 615, 622 (2017)</ref>\n\nProfessor Mila Sohoni has argued that national injunctions are both constitutional and good.<ref>Mila Sohoni, The Lost History of the 'Universal' Injunction, 133 Harv. L.

L. Rev. 920, 924 (2020)</ref> Similarly, attorneys David Hausman & Spencer E. Amdur have defended national injunctions because they can prevent widespread harm, such as deportations of hundreds of thousands of people.<ref>David Hausman & Spencer E. Amdur, Response, Nationwide Injunctions and Nationwide Harm, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 49, 49-50 (2017)</ref> Hausman and Amdur advocate such injunctions \"when necessary to prevent real-world injuries,\" under a framework that \"would otherwise preserve opportunities for percolation across multiple chancellors.\"<ref>David Hausman & Spencer E. Amdur, Response, Nationwide Injunctions and Nationwide Harm, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 49, 49-50 (2017)</ref> Professor Alan Trammell has argued that preclusion principles justify national injunctions specifically in cases \"when the government acts in bad faith, including most notably when government officials fail to abide by settled law.\"<ref>Alan M.

Tracing equity practices at common law, Bray has argued that a federal court may only give an injunction that \"protects the plaintiff vis\u00e0-vis the defendant, wherever the plaintiff and the defendant may both happen to be.\"<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 469 (2017)</ref> It cannot \"constrain the defendant\u2019s conduct vis\u00e0-vis nonparties.\"<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 469 (2017)</ref> That is because, he argues, a federal court \"has no constitutional basis to decide disputes and issue remedies for those who are not parties.\"<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 471 (2017)</ref> Bray has noted that, among other problems, the current practice could lead to \"conflicting injunctions,\" a situation where multiple parties bring suit, one court orders a defendant not to apply a statute or regulation against anyone, and another court orders the same defendant to ignore the first injunction or to continue to implement the statute or regulation.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 462-64 (2017)</ref> Professor Michael Morley has written several articles on national injunctions.<ref>See Michael T. Morley, Nationwide Injunctions, Rule 23(B)(2), and the Remedial Powers of the Lower Courts, 97 B.U. L. Rev. 615, 622-23 (2017)</ref> He has argued that national injunctions through a national \"class action\" are \"presumptively inappropriate,\" but may be lawful when the plaintiffs are asserting clearly established rights, the plaintiffs' rights are indivisible, the plaintiffs' claims are based on the burdens of the unconstitutionality of the challenged provisions, and it would be inappropriate to issue a narrower injunction.<ref>Michael T. Morley, Nationwide Injunctions, Rule 23(B)(2), and the Remedial Powers of the Lower Courts, 97 B.U. L. Rev. 615, 622 (2017)</ref>\n\nProfessor Mila Sohoni has argued that national injunctions are both constitutional and good.<ref>Mila Sohoni, The Lost History of the 'Universal' Injunction, 133 Harv. L. Rev. 920, 924 (2020)</ref> She argues that national injunctions were recognized as a valid remedial power of federal courts for almost all of the twentieth century, and perhaps even earlier.<ref>Mila Sohoni, The Lost History of the 'Universal' Injunction, 133 Harv. L. Rev. 920, 924 (2020)</ref> Similarly, attorneys David Hausman & Spencer E. Amdur have defended national injunctions because they can prevent widespread harm, such as deportations of hundreds of thousands of people.<ref>David Hausman & Spencer E. Amdur, Response, Nationwide Injunctions and Nationwide Harm, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 49, 49-50 (2017)</ref> Hausman and Amdur advocate such injunctions \"when necessary to prevent real-world injuries,\" under a framework that \"would otherwise preserve opportunities for percolation across multiple chancellors.\"<ref>David Hausman & Spencer E. Amdur, Response, Nationwide Injunctions and Nationwide Harm, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 49, 49-50 (2017)</ref> Professor Alan Trammell has argued that preclusion principles justify national injunctions specifically in cases \"when the government acts in bad faith, including most notably when government officials fail to abide by settled law.\"<ref>Alan M.

Since England was the larger and richer of the two Kingdoms, James moved his court to [[London]] in England. The poets of the court therefore moved south and \"began adapting the language and style of their verse to the tastes of the English market\".<ref name=\"m36\">McClure (1994), p. 36</ref> To this event McClure attributes \"the sudden and total eclipse of Scots as a literary language\".<ref name=\"m36\"/> The continuing absence of a Scots translation of the Bible meant that [[Authorized King James Version|the translation of King James]] into English was used in worship in both countries.\n\nThe [[Acts of Union 1707]] amalgamated the Scottish and English Parliaments. However the church, educational and legal structures remained separate. This leads to important professional distinctions in the definitions of some words and terms. There are therefore words with precise definitions in Scottish English which have either no place in English English or have a different definition.\n<!--\nDespite this, the mother tongues of Scottish people remained overwhelmingly Gaelic (in the Highlands) and Scots (in the Lowlands).<ref name=\"m37\">McClure (1994), p. 37</ref>  English was restricted to members of the Scottish aristocracy who spent time in London.<ref name=\"m37\"/>\nPlease add more details: for what period was English restricted to the London-traveling aristocracy? How do we evidence this, especially given the fuzzy line between Scots and English?\nAlso, re McClure (1994) \u2013 the page references are great, but I was unable to find the book. Can you give more details there too?\n-->\n\n==Phonology==\n{{listen|filename=RenfrewshireAccent.ogg|title=Speech example|description=An example of a Scottish male with a middle-class [[Renfrewshire]] accent}}\n\nThe speech of the middle classes in Scotland tends to conform to the grammatical norms of the written standard, particularly in situations that are regarded as formal. [[Highland English]] is slightly different from the variety spoken in the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] in that it is more phonologically, grammatically, and lexically influenced by a [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] [[substratum]]. Similarly, the English spoken in the North-East of Scotland tends to follow the phonology and grammar of [[Doric dialect (Scotland)|Doric]].\n\nAlthough pronunciation features vary among speakers (depending on region and social status), there are a number of phonological aspects characteristic of Scottish English:\n\n* Scottish English is a [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic accent]], meaning {{IPA|/r/}} is typically pronounced in the [[syllable coda]]. The phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} may be a [[postalveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[\u0279]}}, as in Received Pronunciation or General American, but speakers have also traditionally used for the same phoneme a somewhat more common [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}} or, now very rare, the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}<ref>Lodge, Ken (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_nVT_qNvbusC&dq= A Critical Introduction to Phonetics]''. A & C Black. p. 180</ref> (hereafter, {{angle bracket|r}} will be used to denote any rhotic consonant).\n**Although other dialects have merged non-intervocalic {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, {{IPA|/\u028c/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} ([[Fern-fir-fur merger|fern\u2013fir\u2013fur merger]]), Scottish English makes a distinction between the vowels in ''fern'', ''fir'', and ''fur''.\n**Many varieties contrast {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} so that ''hoarse'' and ''horse'' are pronounced differently.\n**{{IPA|/or/}} and {{IPA|/ur/}} are contrasted so that ''shore'' and ''sure'' are pronounced differently, as are ''pour'' and ''poor''.\n**{{IPA|/r/}} before {{IPA|/l/}} is strong. An [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel may occur between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} so that ''girl'' and ''world'' are two-syllable words for some speakers. The same may occur between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}, between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, and between {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}.\n*There is a distinction between {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|[[Voiceless labialized velar approximant|/hw/]]}} in word pairs such as ''witch'' and ''which''.\n*The phoneme {{IPA|[[Voiceless velar fricative|/x/]]}} is common in names and in SSE's many Gaelic and Scots borrowings, so much so that it is often taught to incomers, particularly for \"ch\" in loch. Some Scottish speakers use it in words of Greek origin as well, such as technical, patriarch, etc. (Wells 1982, 408). \n*{{IPA|/l/}} is usually [[Velarization|velarised]] (see [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|dark l]]) except in borrowings like \"glen\" (from Scottish Gaelic \"gleann\"), which had an unvelarised l in their original form. In areas where [[Scottish Gaelic]] was spoken until relatively recently (such as [[Dumfries]] and [[Galloway]]) and in areas where it is still spoken (such as the [[West Highlands]]), velarisation of {{IPA|/l/}} may be absent in many words in which it is present in other areas, but remains in borrowings that had velarised {{IPA|/l/}} in Gaelic, such as \"loch\" (Gaelic \"loch\") and \"clan\" (Gaelic \"clann\").\n*{{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are not [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] in more traditional varieties,<ref>{{cite web|title=Wir Ain Leid|url=http://www.scots-online.org/grammar/sse.htm|accessdate=18 March 2012|location=section \"Consonants\"}}</ref> but are weakly aspirated currently.\n*The past ending ''-ed'' may be realised with {{IPA|/t/}} where other accents use {{IPA|/d/}}, chiefly after unstressed vowels: ''ended'' {{IPA|[\u025bnd\u026at]}}, ''carried'' {{IPA|[kar\u026at]}}\n*[[Vowel length]] is generally regarded as non-phonemic, although a distinctive part of Scottish English is the [[Scots vowel length rule]] (Scobbie et al. 1999). Certain vowels (such as {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, and {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}) are generally long but are shortened before [[nasal stop|nasals]] and voiced [[plosive consonant|plosives]]. However, this does not occur across morpheme boundaries so that ''need'' contrasts with ''kneed'', ''crude'' with ''crewed'' and ''side'' with ''sighed''.\n*Scottish English has no {{IPA|/\u028a/}}, instead transferring Scots {{IPA|/u/}}. Phonetically, this vowel may be pronounced {{IPA|[\u0289]}} or even {{IPA|[\u028f]}}. Thus ''pull'' and ''pool'' are homophones.\n*''Cot'' and ''caught'' are not differentiated in most Central Scottish varieties, as they are in some other varieties.<ref name=\"Wells, pp. 399 ff\">Wells, pp. 399 ff.</ref>\n*In most varieties, there is no {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}-{{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} distinction; therefore, ''bath'', ''trap'', and ''palm'' have the same vowel.<ref name=\"Wells, pp. 399 ff\"/>\n*The ''happY'' vowel is most commonly {{IPA|/e/}} (as in ''face''), but may also be {{IPA|/\u026a/}} (as in ''kit'') or {{IPA|/i/}} (as in ''fleece'').<ref>Wells, p. 405.</ref>\n*{{IPA|/\u03b8s/}} is often used in plural nouns where southern English has {{IPA|/\u00f0z/}} (baths, youths, etc.); ''with'' and ''booth'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}. (See [[Pronunciation of English th]].)\n*In colloquial speech, the [[glottal stop]] may be an allophone of {{IPA|/t/}} after a vowel, as in {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u028c\u0294\u0259r]}}. These same speakers may \"drop the g\" in the suffix ''-ing'' and [[Th-glottalization|debuccalise]] {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} to {{IPA|[h]}} in certain contexts.\n*{{IPA|/\u026a/}} may be more open {{IPA|[\u00eb\u031e]}} for certain speakers in some regions, so that it sounds more like {{IPA|[\u025b]}} (although {{IPA|/\u026a/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b/}} do not merge). Other speakers may pronounce it as {{IPA|[\u026a]}}, just as in many other accents, or with a schwa-like ({{IPA|[\u0259]}}) quality. Others may pronounce it almost as {{IPA|[\u028c]}} in certain environments, particularly after {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/hw/}}.\n\n[[File:Scottish English monophthongs chart.svg|thumb|250px|[[Monophthong]]s of Scottish English (from {{harvcoltxt|Scobbie|Gordeeva|Matthews|2006|p=7}})]]\n<!--See also previous \"confusing\" phonology table [] for more info-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Scottish English vowels<ref>{{cite web|title=Accents of English from Around the World|editor=Heggarty, Paul |display-editors=etal |publisher=University of Edinburgh|year=2013|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/research/gsound/}}</ref> {{nobold|(many individual words do not correspond)}}\n! colspan=\"3\"| Pure vowels\n|-\n!

''Scottish Speech'' in Languages of Scotland, Association for Scottish Literary Studies, Occasional Paper 4, Edinburgh:Chambers 1979. p.106-107</ref> which are less common in other forms of standard English.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nGeneral items are ''wee'', the Scots word for small (also common in [[New Zealand English]], probably under Scottish influence); ''wean'' or ''bairn'' for child (the latter from Common Germanic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/14726?redirectedFrom=bairn#eid|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|work=oed.com}}</ref> cf modern [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''barn'', [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] ''bern'' and also used in [[English language in northern England|Northern English dialects]]); ''[[bonnie]]'' for pretty, attractive, (or good looking, handsome, as in the case of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie)]]; ''braw'' for fine; ''muckle'' for big; ''spail or skelf'' for splinter, ''snib'' for bolt, ''pinkie'' for little finger, ''janitor'' for school caretaker (these last two are also standard in [[American English]]), ''outwith'', meaning 'outside of'; ''cowp'' for tip or spill, ''fankle'' for a tangled mess. ''Kirk'' for church has parallels in other Germanic languages (cf ''kirche'' which was also found in archaic names of some ancient churches in e.g. London). Examples of culturally specific items are ''[[Hogmanay]]''; ''[[caber toss|caber]]'', ''[[haggis]]'', ''[[bothy]]''; ''[[scone]]''; ''[[oatcake]]''; ''[[Tablet (confectionery)|tablet]]''; ''rone'' (roof gutter); ''[[teuchter]]'', ''[[Ned (Scottish)|ned]]'', ''numpty'' (witless person; now more common in the rest of the UK) and ''landward'' (rural); ''It's your shot'' for \"It's your turn\"; and the once notorious but now obsolete ''[[tawse]]''.\n\nThe diminutive ending \"-ie\" is added to nouns to indicate smallness, as in ''laddie'' and ''lassie'' for a young boy and young girl. Other examples are ''peirie'' (child's wooden spinning top) and ''sweetie'' (piece of [[confectionery]]). The ending can be added to many words instinctively, e.g. ''bairn'' (see above) can become ''bairnie'', a small shop can become a ''wee shoppie''. These diminutives are particularly common among the older generations and when talking to children. \n\nThe use of \"How?\" meaning \"Why?\" is distinctive of Scottish, [[Northern England English|Northern English]] and [[Mid Ulster English|Northern Irish English]]. \"Why not?\" is often rendered as \"How no?\".\n\nThere is a range of (often anglicised) legal and administrative vocabulary inherited from Scots<ref>Murison, David (1977, \u00b21978) ''The Guid Scots Tongue'', Edinburgh, William Blackwood, pp. 53-54</ref> e.g. ''depute'' {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u025bpjut/}} for ''deputy'', ''[[Not proven|proven]]'' {{IPA|/\u02c8pro\u02d0v\u0259n/}} for ''proved'' (standard in American English), ''interdict'' for '\"injunction\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/interdict |title=Dictionary of the Scots Language :: SND :: Interdict n., v |publisher=Dsl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/interdict |title=interdict - definition of interdict in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref> and ''[[sheriff-substitute]]'' for \"acting sheriff'\". In Scottish education a ''short leet'' is a list of selected job applicants, and a ''remit'' is a detailed job description. ''[[Provost (civil)#Scotland|Provost]]'' is used for \"mayor\" and ''[[procurator fiscal]]'' for \"public prosecutor\".\n\nOften, lexical differences between Scottish English and Southern Standard English are simply differences in the distribution of shared lexis, such as ''stay'' for \"live\" (as in: ''where do you stay?'').\n\n===Grammatical===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\nThe progressive verb forms are used rather more frequently than in other varieties of standard English, for example with some [[stative verb]]s (''I'm wanting a drink''). The future progressive frequently implies an assumption (''You'll be coming from Glasgow?'').\n\nIn some areas perfect aspect of a verb is indicated using \"be\" as auxiliary with the preposition \"after\" and the present participle: for example \"He is after going\" instead of \"He has gone\" (this construction is borrowed from [[Scottish Gaelic]]).\n\nThe definite article tends to be used more frequently in phrases such as ''I've got the cold/the flu'', ''he's at the school'', ''I'm away to the kirk''.\n\nSpeakers often use prepositions differently. The compound preposition ''off of'' is often used (''Take that off of the table''). Scots commonly say ''I was waiting on you'' (meaning \"waiting for you\"), which means something quite different in Standard English.\n\nIn colloquial speech ''shall'' and ''ought'' are scarce, ''must'' is marginal for obligation and ''may'' is rare. Here are other syntactical structures:\n\n* ''What age are you?'' for \"How old are you?\"\n* ''My hair is needing washed'' or ''My hair needs washed'' for \"My hair needs washing\" or \"My hair needs to be washed\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scots-online.org/grammar/sse.htm|title=Scottish Standard English|work=scots-online.org}}</ref>\n* ''I'm just after telling you'' for \"I've just told you\".\n* ''[[Amn't]] I invited?'' for ''Am I not invited?''\n\nNote that in Scottish English, the first person declarative ''I amn't invited'' and interrogative ''Amn't I invited?'' are both possible.\n\n==See also==\n {{Div col}}\n* [[Bungi creole]] of the Canadian [[Metis people]] of Scottish/British descent\n* [[Dialect]]\n* [[Glasgow patter]]\n* [[Hiberno-English]]\n* [[Highland English]]\n* [[Languages of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Regional accents of English]]\n* [[Scottish Gaelic language]]\n* [[Scottish Corpus of Texts and Speech]]\n* [[Ulster English]]\n {{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|author=Abercrombie, D.|year=1979|chapter=The accents of Standard English in Scotland.|editor1=A.

The resulting shifts to English usage by Scots-speakers resulted in many phonological compromises and lexical transfers, often mistaken for [[Phonological change|mergers]] by linguists unfamiliar with the history of Scottish English.<ref>Macafee, C.

Since England was the larger and richer of the two Kingdoms, James moved his court to [[London]] in England. The poets of the court therefore moved south and \"began adapting the language and style of their verse to the tastes of the English market\".<ref name=\"m36\">McClure (1994), p. 36</ref> To this event McClure attributes \"the sudden and total eclipse of Scots as a literary language\".<ref name=\"m36\"/> The continuing absence of a Scots translation of the Bible meant that [[Authorized King James Version|the translation of King James]] into English was used in worship in both countries.\n\nThe [[Acts of Union 1707]] amalgamated the Scottish and English Parliaments. However the church, educational and legal structures remained separate. This leads to important professional distinctions in the definitions of some words and terms. There are therefore words with precise definitions in Scottish English which have either no place in English English or have a different definition.\n<!--\nDespite this, the mother tongues of Scottish people remained overwhelmingly Gaelic (in the Highlands) and Scots (in the Lowlands).<ref name=\"m37\">McClure (1994), p. 37</ref>  English was restricted to members of the Scottish aristocracy who spent time in London.<ref name=\"m37\"/>\nPlease add more details: for what period was English restricted to the London-traveling aristocracy? How do we evidence this, especially given the fuzzy line between Scots and English?\nAlso, re McClure (1994) \u2013 the page references are great, but I was unable to find the book. Can you give more details there too?\n-->\n\n==Phonology==\n{{listen|filename=RenfrewshireAccent.ogg|title=Speech example|description=An example of a Scottish male with a middle-class [[Renfrewshire]] accent}}\n\nThe speech of the middle classes in Scotland tends to conform to the grammatical norms of the written standard, particularly in situations that are regarded as formal. [[Highland English]] is slightly different from the variety spoken in the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] in that it is more phonologically, grammatically, and lexically influenced by a [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] [[substratum]]. Similarly, the English spoken in the North-East of Scotland tends to follow the phonology and grammar of [[Doric dialect (Scotland)|Doric]].\n\nAlthough pronunciation features vary among speakers (depending on region and social status), there are a number of phonological aspects characteristic of Scottish English:\n\n* Scottish English is a [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic accent]], meaning {{IPA|/r/}} is typically pronounced in the [[syllable coda]]. The phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} may be a [[postalveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[\u0279]}}, as in Received Pronunciation or General American, but speakers have also traditionally used for the same phoneme a somewhat more common [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}} or, now very rare, the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}<ref>Lodge, Ken (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_nVT_qNvbusC&dq= A Critical Introduction to Phonetics]''. A & C Black. p. 180</ref> (hereafter, {{angle bracket|r}} will be used to denote any rhotic consonant).\n**Although other dialects have merged non-intervocalic {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, {{IPA|/\u028c/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} ([[Fern-fir-fur merger|fern\u2013fir\u2013fur merger]]), Scottish English makes a distinction between the vowels in ''fern'', ''fir'', and ''fur''.\n**Many varieties contrast {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} so that ''hoarse'' and ''horse'' are pronounced differently.\n**{{IPA|/or/}} and {{IPA|/ur/}} are contrasted so that ''shore'' and ''sure'' are pronounced differently, as are ''pour'' and ''poor''.\n**{{IPA|/r/}} before {{IPA|/l/}} is strong. An [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel may occur between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} so that ''girl'' and ''world'' are two-syllable words for some speakers. The same may occur between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}, between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, and between {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}.\n*There is a distinction between {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|[[Voiceless labialized velar approximant|/hw/]]}} in word pairs such as ''witch'' and ''which''.\n*The phoneme {{IPA|[[Voiceless velar fricative|/x/]]}} is common in names and in SSE's many Gaelic and Scots borrowings, so much so that it is often taught to incomers, particularly for \"ch\" in loch. Some Scottish speakers use it in words of Greek origin as well, such as technical, patriarch, etc. (Wells 1982, 408). \n*{{IPA|/l/}} is usually [[Velarization|velarised]] (see [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|dark l]]) except in borrowings like \"glen\" (from Scottish Gaelic \"gleann\"), which had an unvelarised l in their original form. In areas where [[Scottish Gaelic]] was spoken until relatively recently (such as [[Dumfries]] and [[Galloway]]) and in areas where it is still spoken (such as the [[West Highlands]]), velarisation of {{IPA|/l/}} may be absent in many words in which it is present in other areas, but remains in borrowings that had velarised {{IPA|/l/}} in Gaelic, such as \"loch\" (Gaelic \"loch\") and \"clan\" (Gaelic \"clann\").\n*{{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are not [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] in more traditional varieties,<ref>{{cite web|title=Wir Ain Leid|url=http://www.scots-online.org/grammar/sse.htm|accessdate=18 March 2012|location=section \"Consonants\"}}</ref> but are weakly aspirated currently.\n*The past ending ''-ed'' may be realised with {{IPA|/t/}} where other accents use {{IPA|/d/}}, chiefly after unstressed vowels: ''ended'' {{IPA|[\u025bnd\u026at]}}, ''carried'' {{IPA|[kar\u026at]}}\n*[[Vowel length]] is generally regarded as non-phonemic, although a distinctive part of Scottish English is the [[Scots vowel length rule]] (Scobbie et al. 1999). Certain vowels (such as {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, and {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}) are generally long but are shortened before [[nasal stop|nasals]] and voiced [[plosive consonant|plosives]]. However, this does not occur across morpheme boundaries so that ''need'' contrasts with ''kneed'', ''crude'' with ''crewed'' and ''side'' with ''sighed''.\n*Scottish English has no {{IPA|/\u028a/}}, instead transferring Scots {{IPA|/u/}}. Phonetically, this vowel may be pronounced {{IPA|[\u0289]}} or even {{IPA|[\u028f]}}. Thus ''pull'' and ''pool'' are homophones.\n*''Cot'' and ''caught'' are not differentiated in most Central Scottish varieties, as they are in some other varieties.<ref name=\"Wells, pp. 399 ff\">Wells, pp. 399 ff.</ref>\n*In most varieties, there is no {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}-{{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} distinction; therefore, ''bath'', ''trap'', and ''palm'' have the same vowel.<ref name=\"Wells, pp. 399 ff\"/>\n*The ''happY'' vowel is most commonly {{IPA|/e/}} (as in ''face''), but may also be {{IPA|/\u026a/}} (as in ''kit'') or {{IPA|/i/}} (as in ''fleece'').<ref>Wells, p. 405.</ref>\n*{{IPA|/\u03b8s/}} is often used in plural nouns where southern English has {{IPA|/\u00f0z/}} (baths, youths, etc.); ''with'' and ''booth'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}. (See [[Pronunciation of English th]].)\n*In colloquial speech, the [[glottal stop]] may be an allophone of {{IPA|/t/}} after a vowel, as in {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u028c\u0294\u0259r]}}. These same speakers may \"drop the g\" in the suffix ''-ing'' and [[Th-glottalization|debuccalise]] {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} to {{IPA|[h]}} in certain contexts.\n*{{IPA|/\u026a/}} may be more open {{IPA|[\u00eb\u031e]}} for certain speakers in some regions, so that it sounds more like {{IPA|[\u025b]}} (although {{IPA|/\u026a/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b/}} do not merge). Other speakers may pronounce it as {{IPA|[\u026a]}}, just as in many other accents, or with a schwa-like ({{IPA|[\u0259]}}) quality. Others may pronounce it almost as {{IPA|[\u028c]}} in certain environments, particularly after {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/hw/}}.\n\n[[File:Scottish English monophthongs chart.svg|thumb|250px|[[Monophthong]]s of Scottish English (from {{harvcoltxt|Scobbie|Gordeeva|Matthews|2006|p=7}})]]\n<!--See also previous \"confusing\" phonology table [] for more info-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Scottish English vowels<ref>{{cite web|title=Accents of English from Around the World|editor=Heggarty, Paul |display-editors=etal |publisher=University of Edinburgh|year=2013|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/research/gsound/}}</ref> {{nobold|(many individual words do not correspond)}}\n! colspan=\"3\"| Pure vowels\n|-\n!

Scottish Accents and Dialects in Trudgil, P. Language in the British Isles. 1984. p.105-108</ref> covert Scotticisms, which generally go unnoticed as being particularly Scottish by those using them, and overt Scotticisms, usually used for stylistic effect, with those using them aware of their Scottish nature.\n\n===Lexical===\n[[File:Outwith.JPG|right|thumb|150px|An example of \"outwith\" on a sign in Scotland]]\nScottish English has inherited a number of lexical items from Scots,<ref>Aitken A.J. ''Scottish Speech'' in Languages of Scotland, Association for Scottish Literary Studies, Occasional Paper 4, Edinburgh:Chambers 1979. p.106-107</ref> which are less common in other forms of standard English.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nGeneral items are ''wee'', the Scots word for small (also common in [[New Zealand English]], probably under Scottish influence); ''wean'' or ''bairn'' for child (the latter from Common Germanic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/14726?redirectedFrom=bairn#eid|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|work=oed.com}}</ref> cf modern [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''barn'', [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] ''bern'' and also used in [[English language in northern England|Northern English dialects]]); ''[[bonnie]]'' for pretty, attractive, (or good looking, handsome, as in the case of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie)]]; ''braw'' for fine; ''muckle'' for big; ''spail or skelf'' for splinter, ''snib'' for bolt, ''pinkie'' for little finger, ''janitor'' for school caretaker (these last two are also standard in [[American English]]), ''outwith'', meaning 'outside of'; ''cowp'' for tip or spill, ''fankle'' for a tangled mess. ''Kirk'' for church has parallels in other Germanic languages (cf ''kirche'' which was also found in archaic names of some ancient churches in e.g. London). Examples of culturally specific items are ''[[Hogmanay]]''; ''[[caber toss|caber]]'', ''[[haggis]]'', ''[[bothy]]''; ''[[scone]]''; ''[[oatcake]]''; ''[[Tablet (confectionery)|tablet]]''; ''rone'' (roof gutter); ''[[teuchter]]'', ''[[Ned (Scottish)|ned]]'', ''numpty'' (witless person; now more common in the rest of the UK) and ''landward'' (rural); ''It's your shot'' for \"It's your turn\"; and the once notorious but now obsolete ''[[tawse]]''.\n\nThe diminutive ending \"-ie\" is added to nouns to indicate smallness, as in ''laddie'' and ''lassie'' for a young boy and young girl. Other examples are ''peirie'' (child's wooden spinning top) and ''sweetie'' (piece of [[confectionery]]). The ending can be added to many words instinctively, e.g. ''bairn'' (see above) can become ''bairnie'', a small shop can become a ''wee shoppie''. These diminutives are particularly common among the older generations and when talking to children. \n\nThe use of \"How?\" meaning \"Why?\" is distinctive of Scottish, [[Northern England English|Northern English]] and [[Mid Ulster English|Northern Irish English]]. \"Why not?\" is often rendered as \"How no?\".\n\nThere is a range of (often anglicised) legal and administrative vocabulary inherited from Scots<ref>Murison, David (1977, \u00b21978) ''The Guid Scots Tongue'', Edinburgh, William Blackwood, pp. 53-54</ref> e.g. ''depute'' {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u025bpjut/}} for ''deputy'', ''[[Not proven|proven]]'' {{IPA|/\u02c8pro\u02d0v\u0259n/}} for ''proved'' (standard in American English), ''interdict'' for '\"injunction\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/interdict |title=Dictionary of the Scots Language :: SND :: Interdict n., v |publisher=Dsl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/interdict |title=interdict - definition of interdict in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref> and ''[[sheriff-substitute]]'' for \"acting sheriff'\". In Scottish education a ''short leet'' is a list of selected job applicants, and a ''remit'' is a detailed job description. ''[[Provost (civil)#Scotland|Provost]]'' is used for \"mayor\" and ''[[procurator fiscal]]'' for \"public prosecutor\".\n\nOften, lexical differences between Scottish English and Southern Standard English are simply differences in the distribution of shared lexis, such as ''stay'' for \"live\" (as in: ''where do you stay?'').\n\n===Grammatical===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\nThe progressive verb forms are used rather more frequently than in other varieties of standard English, for example with some [[stative verb]]s (''I'm wanting a drink''). The future progressive frequently implies an assumption (''You'll be coming from Glasgow?'').\n\nIn some areas perfect aspect of a verb is indicated using \"be\" as auxiliary with the preposition \"after\" and the present participle: for example \"He is after going\" instead of \"He has gone\" (this construction is borrowed from [[Scottish Gaelic]]).\n\nThe definite article tends to be used more frequently in phrases such as ''I've got the cold/the flu'', ''he's at the school'', ''I'm away to the kirk''.\n\nSpeakers often use prepositions differently. The compound preposition ''off of'' is often used (''Take that off of the table''). Scots commonly say ''I was waiting on you'' (meaning \"waiting for you\"), which means something quite different in Standard English.\n\nIn colloquial speech ''shall'' and ''ought'' are scarce, ''must'' is marginal for obligation and ''may'' is rare. Here are other syntactical structures:\n\n* ''What age are you?'' for \"How old are you?\"\n* ''My hair is needing washed'' or ''My hair needs washed'' for \"My hair needs washing\" or \"My hair needs to be washed\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scots-online.org/grammar/sse.htm|title=Scottish Standard English|work=scots-online.org}}</ref>\n* ''I'm just after telling you'' for \"I've just told you\".\n* ''[[Amn't]] I invited?'' for ''Am I not invited?''\n\nNote that in Scottish English, the first person declarative ''I amn't invited'' and interrogative ''Amn't I invited?'' are both possible.\n\n==See also==\n {{Div col}}\n* [[Bungi creole]] of the Canadian [[Metis people]] of Scottish/British descent\n* [[Dialect]]\n* [[Glasgow patter]]\n* [[Hiberno-English]]\n* [[Highland English]]\n* [[Languages of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Regional accents of English]]\n* [[Scottish Gaelic language]]\n* [[Scottish Corpus of Texts and Speech]]\n* [[Ulster English]]\n {{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|author=Abercrombie, D.|year=1979|chapter=The accents of Standard English in Scotland.|editor1=A.

{"title_page": "Darboux integral", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2013}}\nIn [[real analysis]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''Darboux integral''' is constructed using '''Darboux sums''' and is one possible definition of the [[integral]] of a function. Darboux integrals are equivalent to [[Riemann integral]]s, meaning that a function is Darboux-integrable if and only if it is Riemann-integrable, and the values of the two integrals, if they exist, are equal.<ref>{{cite book|author1=David J. Foulis|author2=Mustafa A. Munem|title=After Calculus: Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSMnAQAAIAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Dellen Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-02-339130-9|page=396}}</ref> The definition of the Darboux integral has the advantage of being easier to apply in computations or proofs than that of the Riemann integral. Consequently, introductory textbooks on calculus and real analysis often develop Riemann integration using the Darboux integral, rather than the true Riemann integral.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Calculus (3rd. edition)|last=Spivak|first=M.|publisher=Publish Or Perish, Inc.|year=1994|isbn=0-914098-89-6|location=Houston, TX|pages=253\u2013255|via=}}</ref>  Moreover, the definition is readily extended to defining Riemann-Stieltjes integration.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis (3rd. edition)|last=Rudin|first=W.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=007054235X|location=New York|pages=120\u2013122|via=}}</ref>  Darboux integrals are named after their inventor, [[Gaston Darboux]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe definition of the Darboux integral considers '''upper and lower (Darboux) integrals''', which exist for any bounded real-valued function ''f'' on the interval [''a'',''b'']. The '''Darboux integral''' exists if and only if the upper and lower integrals are equal.

To do this we partition [0,1] into ''n'' equally sized subintervals each of length ''1/n''. We denote a partition of ''n'' equally sized subintervals as ''P''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nNow since ''f(x) = x'' is strictly increasing on [0,1], the infimum on any particular subinterval is given by its starting point. Likewise the supremum on any particular subinterval is given by its end point. The starting point of the ''k''th subinterval in ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> is ''(k-1)/n'' and the end point is ''k/n''. Thus the lower Darboux sum on a partition ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> is given by\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nL_{f,P_n} &= \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} f(x_{k-1})(x_{k} - x_{k-1})\\\\\n         &= \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} \\frac{k-1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n}\\\\\n         &= \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} [k-1]\\\\ \n         &= \\frac{1}{n^2}\\left[ \\frac{(n-1)n}{2} \\right]\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nsimilarly, the upper Darboux sum is given by\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nU_{f,P_n} &= \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} f(x_{k})(x_{k} - x_{k-1})\\\\\n         &= \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} \\frac{k}{n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{n}\\\\\n         &= \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} k\\\\ \n         &= \\frac{1}{n^2}\\left[ \\frac{(n+1)n}{2} \\right]\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSince\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nU_{f,P_n} - L_{f,P_n} &= \\frac{1}{n}\n\\end{align}</math>\nThus for given any ''\u03b5 > 0'', we have that any partition ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> with ''n > 1/\u03b5'' satisfies \n:<math>\\begin{align}\nU_{f,P_n} - L_{f,P_n} &< \\epsilon\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhich shows that ''f'' is Darboux integrable.

Thus for any partition ''P'' we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nL_{f,P} &=\\sum_{k = 1}^{n}(x_{k} - x_{k-1})\\inf_{x \\in [x_{k-1},x_{k}]}f = 0\\\\\nU_{f,P} &=\\sum_{k = 1}^{n}(x_{k} - x_{k-1}) \\sup_{x \\in [x_{k-1},x_{k}]}f = 1\n\\end{align}</math>\nfrom which we can see that the lower and upper Darboux integrals are unequal.\n\n==Refinement of a partition and relation to Riemann integration==\n[[Image:Darboux refinement.svg|250px|thumb|right|When passing to a refinement, the lower sum increases and the upper sum decreases.]]\nA ''refinement'' of the partition\n\n:<math>x_0,\\ldots,x_n  \\,\\!</math>\n\nis a partition\n\n:<math>y_0, \\ldots, y_m \\,\\!</math>\n\nsuch that for every ''i'' with\n\n:<math>0 \\le i \\le n \\,\\!</math>\n\nthere is an integer ''r''(''i'') such that\n\n:<math> x_{i} = y_{r(i)} . \\,\\!</math>\n\nIn other words, to make a refinement, cut the subintervals into smaller pieces and do not remove any existing cuts.

There is {{Explain|date=February 2020}} a tagged partition that comes arbitrarily close to the value of the upper Darboux integral or lower Darboux integral, and consequently, if the Riemann integral exists, then the Darboux integral must exist as well.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Regulated integral]]\n* [[Lebesgue integration]]\n* [[Minimum bounding rectangle]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite web\n| url = http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DarbouxIntegral.html\n| title = Darboux Integral\n| accessdate = 2013-01-08\n| work=[[Wolfram MathWorld]]\n}}\n* [http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Darboux_integral ''Darboux integral'' at Encyclopaedia of Mathematics]\n* {{springer|title=Darboux sum|id=p/d030160}}\n* {{Citation\n | last = Spivak\n | first = Michael\n | title = Calculus\n | publisher = Publish or Perish\n | year = 2008\n | edition = 4\n | isbn = 978-0914098911\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/calculus4thediti00mich\n }}\n\n{{Integral}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Darboux Integral}}\n[[Category:Definitions of mathematical integration]]\n", "name_user": "Debashish0612", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added a link to a video explanation on the topic", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux_integral"}
