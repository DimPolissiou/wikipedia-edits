It might undermine that faith in the Commission itself which is necessary to command respect for its recommendations. This must be avoided, whatever the cost\" reiterating emphatically the need to maintain judicial integrity and impartiality at all costs.<ref>''ibid'' at p. 675.</ref> He was deprived of his civic rights.

It is located in [[Burnside Hall]] at McGill's downtown campus in [[Montreal]].\n\n==History==\nMathematics was taught at McGill as early as 1848 when it was a discipline of [[Natural philosophy|Natural Philosophy]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Arts and Science|chapter-url=http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/resources/guide/vol1/rg32.htm|title=Guide to Archives Resources at McGill University|volume=1|year=1985|isbn=0-7717-0117-9|editor-first=Marcel|editor-last=Caya|publisher=McGill University Archives}}</ref>\n\nMathematics at McGill was initially divided into two largely independent departments, one under the [[McGill University Faculty of Science|Faculty of Arts and Science]] and another under the [[McGill University Faculty of Engineering|Faculty of Engineering]]; the two departments merged in 1924 under the chairmanship of [[Daniel Murray (mathematician)|Daniel Murray]].{{r|genest|p=406}} Still, mathematics remained subsidiary to other programs, owing to McGill's emphasis on [[engineering]] and British-style [[applied mathematics]].{{r|mathcan|page=105}} Until 1945, Mathematics was almost wholly a service department with only seven faculty members. Though a small graduate program was shared with the Physics Department, most of the students in the program were headed for further graduate work in physics.{{r|learning|p=342}}\n\nIn 1945, Department members Lloyd Williams and Gordon Pall founded the [[Canadian Mathematical Society|Canadian Mathematical Congress]], which took the lead in persuading the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] to make funds available for the support of [[pure mathematics]].<ref>{{cite book|page=1523|encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences|volume=2|editor-first=Ivor|editor-last=Grattan-Guiness|publisher=Routledge|location=London|date=1994|isbn=0-415-09239-6|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZptYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1523|title=Mathematics in Canada}}</ref> Meanwhile, as chairman of the Department, A. H. S. Gillon initiated in 1945 an Applied Mathematics program and in 1948 recommended for appointment to a professorship [[Hans Zassenhaus]], a pure mathematician who began to attract a number of strong graduate students into his program. Zassenhaus, along with Professors Wac\u0142aw Kozakiewicz, [[Charles Fox (mathematician)|Charles Fox]], Edward Rosenthall, and [[P. R. Wallace|Phil Wallace]], was instrumental in developing the Department's Graduate School.{{r|genest|p=409}} McGill's first mathematics [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] was awarded to [[Joachim Lambek]], who obtained his doctorate in 1950 under Zassenhaus's supervision.<ref name=scimeeting>{{cite conference|date=2 December 2014|conference=Faculty of Science: Meeting of Faculty|location=Montreal|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/science/files/science/facultyagendadocuments-december_2_2014-_one_file_combined_0.pdf|title=Resolution on the Death of Emeritus Professor Joachim (Jim) Lambek, Department of Mathematics and Statistics|first=Henri|last=Darmon|author-link=Henri Darmon|publisher=[[McGill University]]|page=2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, as public funds came to the university and a larger budget became available, the newly appointment chairman, Edward Rosenthall, concentrated on building a balanced and well-qualified academic team, which could sustain a vigorous graduate program along with the demands made upon the Department in a service capacity. [[Mathematical analysis|Analysis]] and [[algebra]] became strong elements in the Department's program in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, and there was also a lively interest in [[statistics]] and in [[applied mathematics]].{{r|learning|page=343}} Research in [[category theory]] began in 1966, when Lambek decided to promote the subject at McGill.<ref name=bunge>{{cite journal|title=Category Theory at McGill, 1966-2006 (A Personal View)|first=Marta|last=Bunge|authorlink=Marta Bunge|location=Montreal|date=January 2006|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274635769_Category_Theory_at_McGill_1966-2006_A_personal_view}}</ref> The number of full-time staff in the Department had grown to 36 by 1960, and to 56 by 1970.{{r|learning|page=362}} \n\nThe Departmental library was established in 1971, and dedicated in 1987 in honour of Edward Rosenthall.<ref name=rosenthal>{{cite web|title=Edward Rosenthall Mathematics and Statistics Library|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/historicalcollections/library-archival/edward-rosenthall|website=Historical Collections|publisher=McGill University|access-date=31 October 2018}}</ref> At the time of its closure in 2015, the Rosenthall Library held over 14,000 [[Scientific journal|mathematics journals]] dating from the nineteenth century, more than 10,000 [[monograph]]s, as well as a collection of rare mathematics books.{{r|rosenthal}}<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rosenthall Library|date=24 January 2016|first=Jason|last=Polak|website=Aleph Zero Categorical|url=http://blog.jpolak.org/?p=1647}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nMembers of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics are active in directing research in [[algebraic geometry]], [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[applied mathematics]], [[category theory]] and [[mathematical logic|logic]], [[discrete mathematics]], [[geometric group theory]], [[number theory]], and [[probability and statistics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.mcgill.ca/research|title=Research|website=Department of Mathematics and Statistics|publisher=McGill University|access-date=31 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Notable members==\n<!--\n===Alumni===\nNotable alumni of the Department include [[Louis Nirenberg]], winner of the 2015 [[Abel Prize]].<ref>{{MacTutor|id=Nirenberg|title=Louis Nirenberg|date=February 2010}}</ref>\n-->\n===Current members===\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Michael Barr (mathematician)|Michael Barr]]{{r|bunge}}\n* [[Henri Darmon]], [[Coxeter\u2013James Prize]] (1997), [[Cole Prize]] (2017), [[CRM-Fields-PIMS Prize]] (2017)\n* [[Christian Genest]] {{post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}}\n* [[Stephen Drury (mathematician)|Stephen Drury]] \n* [[Pengfei Guan]] {{post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}}, Sloan Fellowship (1993\u20131995)\n* [[Jacques Hurtubise (mathematician)|Jacques Hurtubise]] {{post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}}, Coxeter\u2013James Prize (1993)\n* [[Niky Kamran]] {{post-nominals|country=CAN|FRSC}}, CRM-Fields-PIMS Prize (2014)\n* [[Michael Makkai]]{{r|bunge}}<!--Professor (1974\u20132010)-->\n* [[A.
