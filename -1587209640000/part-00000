It was therefore traditionally performed during [[Vespers]] of Friday, according to the Rule of St. Benedict. As Psalm 144 is long enough, Benedict divided it in two.

The poem was set to music in 1800 by (it is believed) [[Johann Abraham Peter Schulz]].

This version reached number 2 in the [[United Kingdom]] and number 1 in [[Germany]]. In 2014, ''Billboard'' magazine declared the song the \"biggest hit\" of the 1960s.<ref name=\"BB2014\"/>\n\n==History==\nSongs about doing the Twist went back to nineteenth-century minstrelsy, including \"Grape Vine Twist\" from around 1844.  In 1938 [[Jelly Roll Morton]], in \"Winin' Boy Blues\", sang, \"Mama, mama, look at sis, she's out on the levee doing the double twist\"\u2014a reference to both sex and dancing in those days.  As for this particular song, \"The Twist\", Hank Ballard's guitarist, Midnighters member Cal Green, said they picked up the general idea from Brother Joe Wallace of the gospel group [[The Sensational Nightingales]], whose position and its associated image concerns prevented him from recording the song himself.  Many years later, in an interview with Tom Meros that is currently available online, Midnighters' member Lawson Smith recalled the authorship of \"The Twist\" differently, that The Sensational Nightingales' Nathaniel Bills wrote the song instead.  Green and Ballard already had written a song together called \"Is Your Love for Real\", which was based on [[Clyde McPhatter]] and [[The Drifters]]' 1955 song \"What'cha Gonna Do\", so they created an entirely new song by simply putting the new Twist words to the older melody.  They originally recorded a loose version of the song in a Florida studio for Vee-Jay Records in early 1958, with slightly different lyrics, featuring Green on guitar playing like [[Jimmy Reed]].  This version appeared on the box set \"The Vee-Jay Story\" in 1993, but it went unreleased at the time. They did not get around to recording the released version until November 11, 1958, when the Midnighters were in Cincinnati.  Ballard thought \"The Twist\" was the hit side, but [[King Records (United States)|King Records]] producer [[Henry Glover]] preferred the ballad \"Teardrops on Your Letter\", which he'd written himself.\n\n==Chubby Checker version==\nThe song became popular on a Baltimore television dance show hosted by local DJ Buddy Deane; Deane recommended the song to [[Dick Clark]], host of the national ''[[American Bandstand]]''. When the song proved popular with his audience, Clark attempted to book Ballard to perform on the show. Ballard was unavailable, and Clark searched for a local artist to record the song.

Sightings of celebrities doing the dance made the song a hit with adults, particularly after a report in the [[Igor Cassini|Cholly Knickerbocker]] gossip column. Soon there were long lines at the [[Peppermint Lounge]] nightclub in New York, the most popular celebrity twisting spot. This new interest made \"The Twist\" the only recording to hit number one on the United States charts during two separate chart runs, and marked a major turning point for adult acceptance of rock and roll music.<ref name=\"behind\"/>\n\nChecker re-recorded the song numerous times. An updated 1982 recording (from his album ''The Change Has Come'') was retitled \"T-82\", and in the 1990s, he recorded a [[country music|country]] version. In the late 1970s, he recorded a new version that, except for the sound mix and some minor arrangement changes, was identical to the 1960 original; as a result this later version is often misidentified on compilations as the original recording. In 1988, he joined [[The Fat Boys]] on a rap version of the song, which hit number 2 in the UK, number 16 in the US, and number 1 in Germany and Switzerland. Checker also joined the group to perform the song that summer at [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute|a London tribute concert]] for [[Nelson Mandela]].<ref name=\"stars\" /> In addition, he recorded variations on the theme, such as \"[[Let's Twist Again]]\" to keep the craze alive (although \"Let's Twist Again\" was and has remained more popular than \"The Twist\" itself in the United Kingdom). [[Joey Dee and the Starliters]], the Peppermint Lounge house band, scored a hit with \"[[Peppermint Twist]]\", while other artists, including [[Sam Cooke]] scored with other \"Twist\"-themed songs. In Europe, [[Petula Clark]] scored hits in several countries with \"Twist\"-themed records, while [[Bill Haley and His Comets]] recorded several albums of Twist songs in [[Mexico]] for the [[Orfe\u00f3n (Mexican record label)|Orfeon Records]] label. In 1997, the song was featured in a Teledyne Waterpik commercial, and a commercial for [[Denny's]] in 1998, to promote the New Slams.\n\nIn the sixth episode of the second season of the TV series ''[[Quantum Leap]]'', entitled \u201cGood Morning, Peoria\u201d (set in September 9, 1959), Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) and Al Calavicci (Dean Stockwell) have a Kiss with History, meeting Chubby Checker (played by himself) in a radio station (Sam leaps into a radio DJ called Chick Howell), where they sing and dance \"The Twist\".

This version reached number 2 in the [[United Kingdom]] and number 1 in [[Germany]]. In 2014, ''Billboard'' magazine declared the song the \"biggest hit\" of the 1960s.<ref name=\"BB2014\"/>\n\n==History==\nSongs about doing the Twist went back to nineteenth-century minstrelsy, including \"Grape Vine Twist\" from around 1844.  In 1938 [[Jelly Roll Morton]], in \"Winin' Boy Blues\", sang, \"Mama, mama, look at sis, she's out on the levee doing the double twist\"\u2014a reference to both sex and dancing in those days.  As for this particular song, \"The Twist\", Hank Ballard's guitarist, Midnighters member Cal Green, said they picked up the general idea from Brother Joe Wallace of the gospel group [[The Sensational Nightingales]], whose position and its associated image concerns prevented him from recording the song himself.  Many years later, in an interview with Tom Meros that is currently available online, Midnighters' member Lawson Smith recalled the authorship of \"The Twist\" differently, that The Sensational Nightingales' Nathaniel Bills wrote the song instead.  Green and Ballard already had written a song together called \"Is Your Love for Real\", which was based on [[Clyde McPhatter]] and [[The Drifters]]' 1955 song \"What'cha Gonna Do\", so they created an entirely new song by simply putting the new Twist words to the older melody.  They originally recorded a loose version of the song in a Florida studio for Vee-Jay Records in early 1958, with slightly different lyrics, featuring Green on guitar playing like [[Jimmy Reed]].  This version appeared on the box set \"The Vee-Jay Story\" in 1993, but it went unreleased at the time. They did not get around to recording the released version until November 11, 1958, when the Midnighters were in Cincinnati.  Ballard thought \"The Twist\" was the hit side, but [[King Records (United States)|King Records]] producer [[Henry Glover]] preferred the ballad \"Teardrops on Your Letter\", which he'd written himself.\n\n==Chubby Checker version==\nThe song became popular on a Baltimore television dance show hosted by local DJ Buddy Dean; Dean recommended the song to [[Dick Clark]], host of the national ''[[American Bandstand]]''.

When the genus ''Metasequoia'' was first described in 1941, it was from [[Mesozoic Era]] fossils, none of which were less than 150 million years old. While studying fossil samples of the family [[Cupressaceae]], Dr. Shigeru Miki from [[Kyoto University]] identified a divergent leaf form. He realized he had discovered a new genus, which he named ''Metasequoia'', meaning \"like a sequoia\".\n\nIn the same year, Kan Duo (Toh Kan, 1903-1961), professor of Forest Management, National Central University, [[Chongqing]], (formerly Chungking) observed an enormous living specimen while performing a survey in Sichuan and Hubei provinces. Though unaware of Miki's new genus, he recognized the unique traits of the tree. Unfortunately, while he collected some plant material, he did not attempt to identify or publish his findings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=Jinshuang|date=June 2003|title=The Chronology of the \"Living Fossil\" Metasequoia glyptostroboides (Taxodiaceae): A Review (1943-2003)|url=|journal=Harvard Papers in Botany|volume=8|issue=1|pages=10|via=}}</ref> This tree formed part of a local shrine, where villagers called it ''Shui-shan'' {{link text|\u6c34\u6749}} or \"water fir\".<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Bruce |last1=Bartholomew |first2=David E. |last2=Boufford |first3=Stephen A. |last3=Spongberg |date=January 1983 |title=Metasequoia glyptostroboides\u2014Its present status in central China |journal=Journal of the Arnold Arboretum |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=105\u201328 |jstor=43782567 |doi=10.5962/bhl.part.27404 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>This [[hanzi]] for \"fir\" is the same as the [[kanji]] for another species, ''[[Cryptomeria]] japonica'', that is, ''sugi'', Japanese cedar.

(The type tree, 2.48 m (8 ft) at breast height, was in poor health and therefore excluded from the study) No seedlings were found, and if they ever do appear it is legal to remove and transplant them.<ref name=\"Tang et al 2011\"/> The species will continue to live in yards, parks and on roadsides all over China, but the ''M.&nbsp;glyptostroboides'' forest ecosystem could disappear when its mature trees die.<ref name=\"Tang et al 2011\" />\n\n==Cultivation==\nSince the tree's rediscovery, the dawn redwood has become a popular [[Ornamental plant|ornamental tree]] in parks and gardens worldwide.\n\nDawn redwood seed arrived at the [[Arnold Arboretum]] on January 5, 1948,<ref name=\"auto\"/> and was shipped to [[arboreta]] around the world soon after. By 1951, the species had entered the commercial horticultural trade in the US,<ref name=\"auto\"/> and following media excitement about the new discovery, including in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' of March 25 1948,<ref name=\"auto\"/> sales soon took off.\n\nDawn redwood has proved an easy tree to grow in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions, and is now widely planted as an [[Ornamental plant|ornamental tree]]. Planted trees have already reached at least up to 1.84 meters (6 feet) in diameter at breast height and 41.15 meters (135 feet) tall, despite being in cultivation for only 70 years. This rapid rate of growth has led to consideration for using the tree in [[forestry]] [[Plantation#Forestry|plantations]]. It has been discovered that ''M.&nbsp;glyptostroboides'' will thrive in standing water, much like [[Taxodium distichum|bald cypress]], and if left branched to the ground in full sun, will develop the large, contorted [[Trunk (botany)|boles]] that have made it famous. Limbing or pruning at an early age will prohibit this formation later on.\n\nIn cultivation, ''M. glyptostroboides'' is hardy to [[USDA Hardiness Zone|USDA Zone 5]], making it hardy down to lows of \u221225&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221232&nbsp;\u00b0C). It is tolerant of soggy, waterlogged soils; in the wild it is adapted to growing on flood plains. Until it is established in a specific site, it is prone to drought and inadequate water availability. The dawn redwood is recommended for urban areas in the Midwest, Southeast, and East Coast of North America, as its fast growth rate and tolerance for air pollution make it widely adaptable and able to thrive where other species might suffer. This species tends to struggle without irrigation in arid climates such as the American West unless planted directly on or adjacent to a body of water such as a pond or stream. This species is also highly susceptible to damage from contact with heavy amounts of winter de-icing salt.<ref>Dirr, M.A. 1998. ''Manual of Woody Landscape Plants''. Stipes Publishing Co., Champaign, IL. (1453 p.)</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, it was discovered that many of the second-generation trees in cultivation suffered from [[inbreeding depression]] (extremely low genetic variability), which could lead to increased susceptibility to disease and reproductive failure. Many sources claim that the original 1947 seedlots came from as few as one tree; however, this has proven to be false. The original seeds did have a wide range of source trees, and the inbreeding depression is more likely to come from self-pollination by isolated trees. However, the total cultivated population still had less genetic variation than the wild ones, and more widespread seed-collecting expeditions in China in the 1990s sought to resolve this problem and restore genetic diversity to cultivated ''M.&nbsp;glyptostroboides''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Payton|first=Greg|date=2010|title=Conserving the Dawn Redwood: The Ex Situ Collection at the Dawes Arboretum|url=http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/2010-68-1-conserving-the-dawn-redwood-the-ex-situ-collection-at-the-dawes-arboretum.pdf|journal=Arnoldia|volume=68|issue=1|pages=26\u201333|via=|access-date=2018-03-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609152024/http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/2010-68-1-conserving-the-dawn-redwood-the-ex-situ-collection-at-the-dawes-arboretum.pdf|archive-date=2015-06-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===In China===\n[[Pizhou]], [[Jiangsu]] has the longest dawn redwood avenue in the world.

When the genus ''Metasequoia'' was first described in 1941, it was from [[Mesozoic Era]] fossils, none of which were less than 150 million years old. While studying fossil samples of the family [[Cupressaceae]], Dr. Shigeru Miki from [[Kyoto University]] identified a divergent leaf form. He realized he had discovered a new genus, which he named ''Metasequoia'', meaning \"like a sequoia\".\n\nIn the same year, Kan Duo (Toh Kan, 1903-1961), professor of Forest Management, National Central University, [[Chongqing]], (formerly Chungking) observed an enormous living specimen while performing a survey in Sichuan and Hubei provinces.

Such a forest would have been similar to [[bald cypress]] forests in the United States, with many similar species growing in association. Nearly 3,000 trunks were found in the floor of the valley, ranging from 2 meters (6.5 feet) to 8 meters (26 feet) wide at the base. Additionally, houses made of Metasequoia wood 200\u2013300 years old still exist and probably date back to the original settlement of the valley.<ref name=\"arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu\"/><ref name=\"Tang et al 2011\"/>\n\nSince its discovery, the dawn redwood has become something of a national point of pride, and it is protected under Chinese law and also planted widely.<ref name=\"STRWL_Fall_Bulletin_1999\" /> However, it is still listed as endangered in the wild.<ref name=\"IUCN\"/> Cutting of trees or branches is illegal, but the demand for seedlings drives cone collection to the point that natural reproduction is no longer occurring in the dawn redwood forest.<ref name=\"STRWL_Fall_Bulletin_1999\" /> In addition, the landscape has been highly modified by human use, and a 1980 expedition found that the habitat has significantly degraded since the tree's discovery. Most of the other vegetation has been cut, and most of the area is no longer suitable ground for seedlings.<ref name=\"conifers.org\"/> Between 1950 and 1980 several hundred were logged in Metasequoia Valley, some over 2 meters (6.5 feet) wide.<ref name=\"conifers.org\"/><ref name=\"arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu\"/>\n\nA survey in the 2000s counted and measured all wild dawn redwoods. The remaining healthy trees range from 25 cm (10 in) to 1.65 m (5.4 ft) wide at breast height, 12\u201351 m (39.5-167.5 ft) in height, and estimated 41\u2013265 years in age. The average size was 27 m (88.5 ft) tall and 0.45\u20130.9 m (1.5-3 ft) wide at breast height, with an estimated age of about 95 years. (The type tree, 2.48 m (8 ft) at breast height, was in poor health and therefore excluded from the study) No seedlings were found, and if they ever do appear it is legal to remove and transplant them.<ref name=\"Tang et al 2011\"/> The species will continue to live in yards, parks and on roadsides all over China, but the ''M.&nbsp;glyptostroboides'' forest ecosystem could disappear when its mature trees die.<ref name=\"Tang et al 2011\" />\n\n==Cultivation==\nSince the tree's rediscovery, the dawn redwood has become a popular [[Ornamental plant|ornamental tree]] in parks and gardens worldwide.\n\nDawn redwood seed arrived at the [[Arnold Arboretum]] on January 5, 1948,<ref name=\"auto\"/> and was shipped to [[arboreta]] around the world soon after. By 1951, the species had entered the commercial horticultural trade in the US,<ref name=\"auto\"/> and following media excitement about the new discovery, including in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' of March 25 1948,<ref name=\"auto\"/> sales soon took off.\n\nDawn redwood has proved an easy tree to grow in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions, and is now widely planted as an [[Ornamental plant|ornamental tree]]. Planted trees have already reached at least up to 1.84 meters (6 feet) in diameter at breast height and 41.15 meters (135 feet) tall, despite being in cultivation for only 70 years. This rapid rate of growth has led to consideration for using the tree in [[forestry]] [[Plantation#Forestry|plantations]]. It has been discovered that ''M.&nbsp;glyptostroboides'' will thrive in standing water, much like [[Taxodium distichum|bald cypress]], and if left branched to the ground in full sun, will develop the large, contorted [[Trunk (botany)|boles]] that have made it famous. Limbing or pruning at an early age will prohibit this formation later on.\n\nIn cultivation, ''M. glyptostroboides'' is hardy to [[USDA Hardiness Zone|USDA Zone 5]], making it hardy down to lows of \u221225&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221232&nbsp;\u00b0C). It is tolerant of soggy, waterlogged soils; in the wild it is adapted to growing on flood plains. Until it is established in a specific site, it is prone to drought and inadequate water availability. The dawn redwood is recommended for urban areas in the Midwest, Southeast, and East Coast of North America, as its fast growth rate and tolerance for air pollution make it widely adaptable and able to thrive where other species might suffer. This species tends to struggle without irrigation in arid climates such as the American West unless planted directly on or adjacent to a body of water such as a pond or stream. This species is also highly susceptible to damage from contact with heavy amounts of winter de-icing salt.<ref>Dirr, M.A. 1998. ''Manual of Woody Landscape Plants''. Stipes Publishing Co., Champaign, IL. (1453 p.)</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, it was discovered that many of the second-generation trees in cultivation suffered from [[inbreeding depression]] (extremely low genetic variability), which could lead to increased susceptibility to disease and reproductive failure. Many sources claim that the original 1947 seedlots came from as few as one tree; however, this has proven to be false. The original seeds did have a wide range of source trees, and the inbreeding depression is more likely to come from self-pollination by isolated trees. However, the total cultivated population still had less genetic variation than the wild ones, and more widespread seed-collecting expeditions in China in the 1990s sought to resolve this problem and restore genetic diversity to cultivated ''M.&nbsp;glyptostroboides''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Payton|first=Greg|date=2010|title=Conserving the Dawn Redwood: The Ex Situ Collection at the Dawes Arboretum|url=http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/2010-68-1-conserving-the-dawn-redwood-the-ex-situ-collection-at-the-dawes-arboretum.pdf|journal=Arnoldia|volume=68|issue=1|pages=26\u201333|via=|access-date=2018-03-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609152024/http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/2010-68-1-conserving-the-dawn-redwood-the-ex-situ-collection-at-the-dawes-arboretum.pdf|archive-date=2015-06-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===In China===\n[[Pizhou]], [[Jiangsu]] has the longest dawn redwood avenue in the world.
