Having become a member of the Union of Writers of the USSR in 1967, he was admitted to the Union of Journalists of the USSR in 1968. He continued to write about Crimea in both Russian and Crimean Tatar, but his participation in the Crimean Tatar movement led to him having to leave Central Asia. He resettled in Novorossiysk, which was closer to Crimea, but due to the lack of a sizable Crimean Tatar population, his ability to participate in the Crimean Tatar movement was somewhat stifiled and it was harder to get his writings in Crimean Tatar published, since almost nobody in Novorossiysk was fluent in the language. For the next few years most of his writing was in Russian. He later continued his work with the Crimean Tatar movement, becoming one of the organizers for the July 1987 Moscow picket for the right of return, where he gave a speech. He later participated in the march from Taman to Simferopol, resulting in him being condemned by name in the newspaper ''[[Pravda Vostoka]]'' for his role in organizing the protest despite his membership in the Union of Writers of the USSR. After the publication of the newspaper, he and other participants in the march faced intense persecution for their role in it. Despite ongoing persecution of activists in the Crimean Tatar movement, he continued to support the cause; he eventually got his works published in Crimea in the late 1990s, but he lived in Novorossiysk for the remainder of his life. After he died on 21 March 2004 he was buried there, and in 2014 a monument in his hometown of Albat was erected in his memory. His poetry mouring the loss of his beloved Crimea remain popular today.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://milli-firka.org/%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%b8%d1%82%d1%83%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%80-%d1%8d%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bd-%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%b2%d0%b5%d1%87%d0%bd%d0%be-%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%b7%d0%b2%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b8%d0%bb%d1%81%d1%8f-%d0%b2-%d0%b0/|title=\u0421\u0435\u0438\u0442\u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u042d\u043c\u0438\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0410\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0442|last=Khurshutov|first=Asan|date=28 April 2014|website=Milli Firka|language=ru|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimeantatars.club/life/society/kto-avtor-etih-stihov-sen-olmasan-aziz-halkym-kimge-kerek-bu-dyunya|title=\u041a\u0442\u043e \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0432: \"\u0421\u0435\u043d \u043e\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d\u044a, \u0430\u0437\u0438\u0437 \u0445\u0430\u043b\u043a\u044a\u044b\u043c, \u043a\u0438\u043c\u0433\u0435 \u043a\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a \u0431\u0443 \u0434\u044e\u043d\u044c\u044f\"?|last=|first=|date=2017-06-18|website=Crimeantatars.club|language=ru-RU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ana-yurt.com/qrt/content/seitumer-emin-1921-2004|title=\u0421\u0415\u0418\u0422\u0423\u041c\u0415\u0420 \u042d\u041c\u0418\u041d (1921 \u2013 2004)|last=|first=|date=|website=ana-yurt.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://milli-firka.org/%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%b8%d1%82%d1%83%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%80-%d1%8d%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bd-%d1%82%d1%8b-%d0%b6%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%b8-%d0%bc%d0%be%d0%b9-%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b4/|title=\u0421\u0435\u0438\u0442\u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u042d\u043c\u0438\u043d: \u0422\u044b \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434...|date=2015-05-15|website=\u041c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438 \u0424\u0438\u0440\u043a\u0430|language=ru-RU|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Emin, Seitumer}}\n[[Category:1921 births]]\n[[Category:2004 deaths]]\n[[Category:Crimean Tatar writers]]\n[[Category:Crimean Tatar activists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n|name = Seitumer Emin\n|image = Seitumer Emin.jpg\n|native_name = Seit\u00fcmer \u011eafar o\u011flu Emin\n|birth_date = 15 May 1921\n|birth_place = Albat village, [[Bakhchysarai Raion]], [[Crimea]], [[RSFSR]]\n|death_date = 21 March 2004 (aged 82)\n|death_place = [[Novorossiysk]], [[Russia|Russian Federation]]\n|awards=[[Order of the Patriotic War]]\n}}\n'''Seitumer Emin''' ({{lang-crh|Seit\u00fcmer \u011eafar o\u011flu Emin}}, {{lang-ru|\u0421\u0435\u0438\u0442\u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0413\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u042d\u043c\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432}}; 15 May 1921 \u2013 21 March 2004) was a Crimean Tatar writer, civil rights activist, and Soviet partisan during World War II.\n\n==Early life==\nEmin was born on 15 May 1921 to a Crimean Tatar peasant family in Albat.

After the publication of the newspaper, he and other participants in the march faced intense persecution for their role in it. Despite ongoing persecution of activists in the Crimean Tatar movement, he continued to support the cause; he eventually got his works published in Crimea in the late 1990s, but he lived in Novorossiysk for the remainder of his life. After he died on 21 March 2004 he was buried there, and in 2014 a monument in his hometown of Albat was erected in his memory. His poetry mouring the loss of his beloved Crimea remain popular today.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://milli-firka.org/%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%b8%d1%82%d1%83%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%80-%d1%8d%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bd-%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%b2%d0%b5%d1%87%d0%bd%d0%be-%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%b7%d0%b2%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b8%d0%bb%d1%81%d1%8f-%d0%b2-%d0%b0/|title=\u0421\u0435\u0438\u0442\u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u042d\u043c\u0438\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0410\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0442|last=Khurshutov|first=Asan|date=28 April 2014|website=Milli Firka|language=ru|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimeantatars.club/life/society/kto-avtor-etih-stihov-sen-olmasan-aziz-halkym-kimge-kerek-bu-dyunya|title=\u041a\u0442\u043e \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0432: \u00ab\u0421\u0435\u043d \u043e\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d\u044a, \u0430\u0437\u0438\u0437 \u0445\u0430\u043b\u043a\u044a\u044b\u043c, \u043a\u0438\u043c\u0433\u0435 \u043a\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a \u0431\u0443 \u0434\u044e\u043d\u044c\u044f\u00bb?|last=|first=|date=2017-06-18|website=Crimeantatars.club|language=ru-RU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ana-yurt.com/qrt/content/seitumer-emin-1921-2004|title=\u0421\u0415\u0418\u0422\u0423\u041c\u0415\u0420 \u042d\u041c\u0418\u041d (1921 \u2013 2004)|last=|first=|date=|website=ana-yurt.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://milli-firka.org/%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%b8%d1%82%d1%83%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%80-%d1%8d%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bd-%d1%82%d1%8b-%d0%b6%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%b8-%d0%bc%d0%be%d0%b9-%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%be%d0%b4/|title=\u0421\u0435\u0438\u0442\u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u042d\u043c\u0438\u043d: \u0422\u044b \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434...|date=2015-05-15|website=\u041c\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438 \u0424\u0438\u0440\u043a\u0430|language=ru-RU|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Emin, Seitumer}}\n[[Category:1921 births]]\n[[Category:2004 deaths]]\n[[Category:Crimean Tatar writers]]\n[[Category:Crimean Tatar activists]]\n", "name_user": "JHunterJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: condemed \u2192 condemned", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seitumer_Emin"}

The locals, led by the chaplain of the village, protested that the bakery's [[Labor rights|working conditions]] dissatisfied them and, as well as feared that the immigrants could \"impose their culture\" and \"threaten the Hungarian local ethnic identity\". On 11 February, a petition signed by 1,800 people was sent to the [[town hall]] of the village with several requests, among them, the improvement of these working conditions, the end of immigration to the village and compensations and apologies to the population.\n\nThe incident affected the popularity and income of the company, with workers and owners being repeatedly threatened by locals. The two Sri Lankans were forced to move in [[Gheorgheni]]. Furthermore, the incident received great [[media coverage]]. Other previous cases that happened in other cities began to receive more attention, and conflicts between the country's Romanian ethnic majority and the Hungarian minority sparked. [[Sociologist]]s and journalists have said that this is an opportunity to start debating the existing discrimination against foreigners and the overexploitation of many workers in Romania. In the end, the owner of the company K\u00f6ll\u0151 Katalin met with the chaplain to discuss the situation. On 3 March, [[Kelemen Hunor]], president of the [[Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania]] (UDMR), announced that the situation had finally normalized.\n\n==Background==\n{{Location map|Romania\n|float = left\n|caption = Location of [[Ditr\u0103u]]\n|label = Ditr\u0103u\n|coordinates = {{coord|46|51|39|N|25|34|26|E|display=inline}}\n}}\nDue to the large number of [[Romanian nationality law|Romanian citizens]] (regardless of [[ethnicity]]) who have emigrated from [[Romania]], several companies have been left without sufficient [[human resources]], which has led them to attract immigrants.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-23632580-lideri-politici-din-harghita-condamna-manifestarile-xenofobie-ditrau-cer-autoritatilor-masuri.htm|title=Lideri politici din Harghita condamn\u0103 \"manifest\u0103rile de xenofobie\" de la Ditr\u0103u \u015fi cer autorit\u0103\u0163ilor s\u0103 ia m\u0103suri|newspaper=[[Hotnews.ro]]|date=30 January 2020|language=ro}}</ref> However, a 2019 study by the [[Romanian Institute for Evaluation and Strategy]] (IRES) showed that 68% of the Romanians surveyed were highly suspicious of immigrants and 50% would stop them at the border.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/social/csaba-asztalos-presedintele-cncd-povestea-de-la-ditrau-consecinta-a-discursului-urii-1252917|title=Csaba Asztalos, pre\u0219edintele CNCD: Povestea de la Ditr\u0103u, consecin\u021b\u0103 a discursului urii|first=Luana|last=P\u0103v\u0103luc\u0103|newspaper=[[Digi 24]]|date=30 January 2020|language=ro}}</ref>\n\nThe inhabitants of [[Ditr\u0103u]], composed of [[Catholic]] [[Sz\u00e9kelys]] ([[Hungarians]]), are, according to the journalist Keno Verseck, \"extremely traditionalist and conservative\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/viktor-orbans-dangerous-export-of-ideologies/a-52246500|title=Viktor Orban's dangerous export of ideologies|first=Keno|last=Verseck|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=3 February 2020}}</ref> [[Ioan-Aurel Pop]], president of the [[Romanian Academy]], has declared that the community of Ditr\u0103u is a closed one, coming \"from an older world\".<ref name=\":3\">{{cite news|url=https://www.agerpres.ro/cultura/2020/02/02/presedintele-academiei-despre-cazul-ditrau-intamplarea-cu-radacini-mult-mai-profunde-este-vorba-si-de-rasism--441822|title=Pre\u0219edintele Academiei, despre cazul Ditr\u0103u: \u00cent\u00e2mplarea \u2013 cu r\u0103d\u0103cini mult mai profunde; este vorba \u0219i de rasism|first=Daniel|last=Popescu|newspaper=[[Agerpres]]|date=2 February 2020|language=ro}}</ref> According to the [[sociologist]] Dumitru Sandu, this closure is cultural, being determined by ethnic and religious factors.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ziare.com/social/romani/paradoxul-ditrau-ce-dezvaluie-statisticile-si-ce-pericole-ascunde-prima-miscare-sociala-anti-imigratie-din-romania-interviu-1596806|title=\"Paradoxul Ditr\u0103u\" \u2013 ce dezvaluie statisticile si ce pericole ascunde prima miscare sociala anti-imigratie din Romania Interviu|first=Camelia|last=Badea|newspaper=ziare.com|date=9 February 2020|language=ro}}</ref> Locals mainly watch, read and listen to [[Hungarian media]] close to the [[Government of Hungary|country's government]], causing the transmission of [[liberalist]] doctrinal elements to them.

On 11 February, a petition signed by 1,800 people was sent to the [[town hall]] of the village with several requests, among them, the improvement of these working conditions, the end of immigration to the village and compensations and apologies to the population.\n\nThe incident affected the popularity and income of the company, with workers and owners being repeatedly threatened by locals. The two Sri Lankans were forced to move in [[Gheorgheni]]. Furthermore, the incident received great [[media coverage]].

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. \"Self-abuse,\" as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth & Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as \"bad\" or \"wrong.\" In an age when people are urged to practice \"[[safer sex]],\" masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}</ref><ref name=\"Sigel2004\">{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|series= |issue=4|pages=1065\u20131066|issn=0022-4529|accessdate=|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

The implications were clear: if most people masturbated and did not experience insanity, debility, and early death, then masturbation could not be held accountable to the etiology that had been assigned it.

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. \"Self-abuse,\" as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth & Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as \"bad\" or \"wrong.\" In an age when people are urged to practice \"[[safer sex]],\" masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}</ref><ref name=\"Sigel2004\">{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|series= |issue=4|pages=1065\u20131066|issn=0022-4529|accessdate=|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

He was born into the family of late Sheikh Abdul Baqi al-Ilory.\n\nA [[Maliki]] scholar and the author of several books in the [[Arabic language]], he was a Sufi ascetic in the [[Qadiriyya]] order. He founded the Arabic and Islamic Training Centre in Agege, a suburb of Lagos, Nigeria, in 1952, from which generations of Qur'anic exegetes originated.\n\n==Biography==\nAdam al-Ilory was born in the city of [[Wasa, Benin|Wasa]] in northern [[Benin]], to a Beninese mother and a [[Nigeria]]n father of [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] ethnicity. His father, Abdul Baqi, was a scholar in Qur'anic exegesis whose nomadic preacher work took him to cities like [[Ibadan]], [[Abeokuta]], [[Ede, Osun|Ede]], [[Oshogbo]] and Wasa in the present Republic of Benin where Adam al-Ilory was born in 1917. Back In [[Ilorin]], in the state of [[Kwara]] in Nigeria, Sheikh Adam al-Ilory finished his Qur'anic humanities and studied all the Islamic sciences of the religion. He was then initiated to [[Sufism]] in the [[Qadiriyya]] way, and took the [[wird]] from his teacher Sheikh Adam Namaji  el-Kanawy  alfindiki he used to attend the Wazifa at the  Sheikh Adam's Zawiya as revealed by Sheikh Muhammad Habeebullahi Adam Al-ilory.  He also created the Markaz Teaching Center in 1952, which today offers not only classical Arabic teaching but also technical and vocational training.\n\n==His writings==\nSheikh Adam left works whose depth, richness and originality remain a major contribution of the [[Yoruba people]] to the heritage of [[Islam]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} His writings, sometimes prosodic, deal with themes of reflection such as death, the relationship of local customs with Maliki jurisprudence, the biography of [[Abdul-Quadir al-Jilani]] , morality, mysticism, human rights, the history of Yoruba people, methods of government and Arabic grammar. Some of his works include:\n* Aseem Soba (Morning Breeze)\n* Markaz Talimil Arabiy (Markhaz Center for Arabic Language Learning)\n* Ali Heedu Al'Arbahuna (Markhaz Center, 40 years old, 1985)\n* Aslu Koba il Yoruba (History of the Yoruba People)\n* El Islam Fi Naijiriyya (Islam in Nigeria)\n* Lamhada fi Barul al Ulama al-Ilory (Overview of the Scientists of the City of Ilorin)\n* Attarulilemi Watasowuf (Role of Science and Sufism in Islam)\n* Dahoru Tasowuwasofiyat (Purpose of Sufism)\n* Niusomtahalim Arabiy Wahlislamiy (Guide to Learning Islam and the Arabic Language)\n* Ukukuli Hinsanni (Human Rights)\n* Al Islamdinu Wadaholat (Islam and Government)\n* Al Islam Watakolid Jahili (Islam and the black race)\n\n== Establishment of Arabic and Islamic Training Centre  (Markaz Agege ) ==\n\nWith the establishment of Markaz in 1952, Shaykh Adam introduced an unprecedented modernity and standardization into the learning of Arabic language and Islamic culture in West African sub-region, especially Nigeria.\n\nThe education provided at Al-llory's centre used modern teaching methods. For instance, it was in Markaz that the use of chalk and blackboard for teaching Arabic and Islamic education was first introduced in Southwest Nigeria. Hitherto, the teaching instruments were wooden slates and local ink. It was in Markaz that a curriculum was first introduced which classified studies into subjects while pupils were distributed into classrooms according to their levels. It was in Markaz that pupils of Arabic and Islamic education first wore uniforms and sat on chairs rather than on a bare floor, while writing with pencil or pen in notebooks. It was in Markaz that written examination was first conducted as a means of assessing and promoting pupils from class to class while certificates were issued to successful madrasah graduates as a measure of their level of education. It was in Markaz that such facilities as dormitories, library, printing press and clinic were first provided for students.<ref name=\"Vanguard News 2018\">{{cite web | title=Sheikh Adam Al Ilory: Centenary celebrations begin April 15 | website=Vanguard News | date=2018-03-30 | url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/03/sheikh-adam-al-ilory-centenary-celebrations-begin-april-15/ | access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref>\n\n==First graduation ceremony==\n\nWith the first graduation ceremony of Markaz in 1957, Sheikh Adam won a landmark victory for his methods.

His father, Abdul Baqi, was a scholar in Qur'anic exegesis whose nomadic preacher work took him to cities like [[Ibadan]], [[Abeokuta]], [[Ede, Osun|Ede]], [[Oshogbo]] and Wasa in the present Republic of Benin where Adam al-Ilory was born in 1917. Back In [[Ilorin]], in the state of [[Kwara]] in Nigeria, Sheikh Adam al-Ilory finished his Qur'anic humanities and studied all the Islamic sciences of the religion.

For instance, it was in Markaz that the use of chalk and blackboard for teaching Arabic and Islamic education was first introduced in Southwest Nigeria. Hitherto, the teaching instruments were wooden slates and local ink. It was in Markaz that a curriculum was first introduced which classified studies into subjects while pupils were distributed into classrooms according to their levels. It was in Markaz that pupils of Arabic and Islamic education first wore uniforms and sat on chairs rather than on a bare floor, while writing with pencil or pen in notebooks. It was in Markaz that written examination was first conducted as a means of assessing and promoting pupils from class to class while certificates were issued to successful madrasah graduates as a measure of their level of education. It was in Markaz that such facilities as dormitories, library, printing press and clinic were first provided for students.<ref name=\"Vanguard News 2018\">{{cite web | title=Sheikh Adam Al Ilory: Centenary celebrations begin April 15 | website=Vanguard News | date=2018-03-30 | url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/03/sheikh-adam-al-ilory-centenary-celebrations-begin-april-15/ | access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref>\n\n==First graduation ceremony==\n\nWith the first graduation ceremony of Markaz in 1957, Sheikh Adam won a landmark victory for his methods.
