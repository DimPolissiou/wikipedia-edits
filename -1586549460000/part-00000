{"title_page": "Correspondence of Lorraine toponyms in French and German", "text_new": "The various toponyms in the historical region of [[Lorraine]] are often known by very different names depending on the language in which they are expressed. This article provides an understanding of the linguistic and historical origin of this diversity and lists a number of correspondences for communes and lesser localities in the four departments of the former region: [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]], [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]], [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]], and [[Vosges (department)|Vosges]].\n\n== Exonyms and endonyms ==\n\nIn the context of toponyms, and with regard to the scope of this article, [[Exonym and endonym|exonyms and endonyms]] are the differing external and internal names, respectively, used by different languages or cultures for a specific geographic place. For the people that speak German and live in Germany, for example, ''Deutschland'' is their endonym for that country. Conversely, ''Allemagne'' is the exonym in French, 'Germany' is the exonym in English, and so on.\n\nThe same idea can apply within a country too, between regions having vastly different linguistical and cultural histories. The emphasis in this article is on those toponyms that began as Gallo-Roman endonyms in some cases, but more often as endonyms following the [[Migration Period|Germanic migrations]], and particularly what emerged from the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] dynasties. Now, more than a millennium later, many of these toponyms have three different names\u2014in [[Lorraine Franconian]], French, and German\u2014due to shifts in culture and language and changes in land possession.\n\n== Linquistical aspects of toponyms in Lorraine ==\n\n=== The 'determinant-determined' of the Romano-Francs ===\n\nThe origin of [Toponymy|toponyms], of which [[Exonym and endonym|exonyms]] are a certain type, is sometimes controversial, especially in [[Lorraine]] where successive or simultaneous occupations by different peoples and changes in culture have often influenced toponymy more than elsewhere.\n\nAs in all regions marked by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] influence, adjectives or appellatives often precede nouns. Many toponyms are formed with the name of a local lord or land owner. In some cases, however, a particular topographical, religious, or historical aspect may have played a more important role, which is difficult to determine in [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]] formations in particular. While [[Gaulish language|Gallic]] toponyms are often poorly clarified due to insufficient knowledge of the language, Romanesque toponyms often play the role of those older Celtic toponyms that have been redesigned in the Romanesque style.\n\nThe [[Ripuarian Franks|Ripuarian]] and [[Salian Franks|Salian]] [[Franks]], and for some time also the [[Alemanni]] in eastern Lorraine, introduced Germanic toponyms. A patronymic practice of the Romano-Francs that developed from the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian Dynasty]] was to merge Roman and Germanic habits. The Germanic rule of word composition from right to left (i.e. the decisive-determined order), largely governs the formation of Lorraine toponyms, both in Germanic and in Roman dialect.\n\nFor example, the Lorraine dialect places the adjective epithet before the noun it describes. A \"white rupt\" is a \"white stream\" (clear and transparent meaning). This is especially true for oronyms and toponyms in localities that make extensive use of local dialect. [[Gerardmer]] (''Giraumou\u00e8'') is the \"Lake of Gerold\", which can therefore be translated in the same order in German language: ''Geroldsee''. The use of ''Geroltzsee'' is attested locally as early as 1484.<ref>(In French.) ''Archives de Meurthe-et-Moselle'', B 739, {{n\u00b0|39}}</ref><ref name=\"Marichal-dict-vosges\">[[Paul Marchal]], ''Dictionnaire topographique du d\u00e9partement des Vosges, comprenant les noms de lieux anciens et modernes'', Paris : Imprimerie nationale, 1941 ({{p.|183}}) [http://cths.fr/dico-topo/affiche-vedettes.php?cdep=88&cpage=183 online].</ref>\n\nThis data is fundamental in Romanesque toponymy and the determining-defined order, sometimes misunderstood, is the rule in [[Normandy]] (except [[Avranchin]]), [[Picardy]], [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], [[Champagne-Ardenne]], northern [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] and [[\u00cele-de-France]], so it is not surprising that we find this method of composition in Romanesque Lorraine.\n\nIn the west and south, the reverse order \u2014 determined-determinant \u2014 is more dominant. Thus, for example, names like ''Neufch\u00e2teau'', ''Neufch\u00e2tel'', ''Neuville'', and ''Neubourg du nord'' have opposite construction to ''Chateauneuf'', ''Castelnau'', ''Villeneuve'', and ''Bourgneuf'' further south. Even if a Lorrain does not feel completely at home in [[Flanders]] because of the Flemish forms (''-kerque'', ''-em'', ''-hem'', ''-hout'', ''-brouck'', ''-berghe'', ''-dorp'') largely different from German forms, and even more so in Normandy with the Anglo-Norroese appellatives (''-crique-'', ''-ham'', ''-londe'', ''brique-'' [?], ''hougue'' / ''hogue'', Torp(s) / ''-tour(ps))'', they can easily feel a common practice (''-kirch'', ''-om'', ''-heim'', ''-holtz'', ''-bruck'', ''-berg'', ''-troff'' / ''-droff'').\n\nIn German-speaking Lorraine, the word ''dorf'' (for 'village') is often passed to ''troff'' by hardening from /''d''/ to /''t''/ and [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] from /''r''/.\n\nThe toponyms in ''-angel'' ([[Proto-Germanic language|Common Germanic]] ''-ing'') are typically Lorrainian and correspond to a relatively recent decline in Germanic speaking in Lorraine. Elsewhere this form is exceptional if we except [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Luxembourgish]] part of [[Wallonia]]. In Flanders and [[Artois]], ''-inge'', ''-in'', ''-ain'', its correspondents, are also the expression of a decline in the Flemish language or at least a desire to make toponyms more [[Francization|Gallicized]]. In the Romanesque area, where Germanic speakers disappeared very early, the suffix is found in the forms ''-ans'' in Franche-Comt\u00e9 or Burgundy, in the southwest and a little in Languedoc in the forms ''-eins'', ''-ens'', ''-ein'' and sometimes also ''-ans''. This suffix is much rarer in the west, where it sometimes takes the form of ''-an'' or ''-angles''. Its absence is remarkable in northern Picardy, a region where Romanesque toponymy is the most \"Germanized\" in France.\n\nParadoxically, in Romanesque Lorraine, there is no common series of calls in the north and northwest, whose Germanic origin is proven. Thus, we do not find these types frequently:\n\n* Husdinium of ''*husidinja'' (shelter) in Hodeng, Hodent, Houdan, Hesdin...\n* ''hlar'' (wasteland) in Mouflers, Flers, Meulers...\n* ''ala(c)h'' (temple) in Neauphe, Neaufles, Neauphle or Niafles, and Boffles, Bouafles...\n* ''afisna'' / ''avisna'' (pasture) in Avesnes, Avernes...\n* ''*Rosbaki'' (reed stream) has evolved in Frankish Lorraine in Rohrbach, Rorbach, elsewhere in the north and northwest, and there are Robecq, Rebecques, Rebais, or Rebets...\n\nYou can find toponyms in short from the [[Doubs]] to [[Normandy]], from [[Ile-de-France]] to Walloon Belgium. The ''-court'' toponyms have been chronologically replaced by the ''-ville'' toponyms, of which Romanesque Lorraine is the second 'provider' after Normandy and before the exceptional area of [[Beauce, France|Beauce]]. There are also some in the [[Charentes]] and in the southwest around [[Toulouse]].\n\n=== Lorraine [[diglossia]] ===\n\nIndependent ducal Lorraine included a Bailiwick of Germany<ref>See [[w:fr:Bailliage d'Allemagne]]</ref> that crossed the current Moselle border to the north. The Lorraine Romans referred to all those who spoke a Germanic dialect as 'Germans' as opposed to their Romance language. So a German (or ''Ollemand'') for a Romanesque Lorrain can also be a Lorrain of the Bailiwick of Germany or an Alsatian, or any person living beyond that. Conversely, neighbouring German-speaking people often called the Welsches romanophones.<ref>Welsch is a German word derived from Walh to designate peoples speaking a non-Germanic language, usually Celtic or Romanesque. Welsch (or welche) is also a Romanesque dialect, spoken in the Welsh country of Alsace, and the name given to those who speak it. In Switzerland, Welsch is the familiar nickname given by the German-speaking Swiss to the French-speaking Swiss. See [[w:fr:Welsch]].</ref> This is also the case in Switzerland.\n\nLorraine's toponymy is not only a back-and-forth between the German and French forms more specific to the last two centuries. It is older, and shows a sensitivity common to all of eastern France where the 'determinant-determined' pair largely dominates while respecting habits and rules that ignore the heritage language.\n\nIn the Lorraine of the Ancient Regime Society,<ref name=\"fr-ancient-regime\">See [[w:fr:Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Ancien R\u00e9gime]]</ref> the coexistence of a Romanesque and Germanic form for the same place was not uncommon. It was only with the integration into France under [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski|Stanislaus]] and then under the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin regime]] and Prussian imperialism that both language and toponyms took on a political, patriotic, symbolic and identity value. Previously, the Duke of Lorraine recognized the official existence of German and French on his lands at the risk of having to have the most important acts and charters translated one way or the other. In the regions of passage between the Germanic area and the Romanesque basin, the same place was named in the language of the respective speaker. This is the case for the toponym, ''Hautes Chaumes'',<ref>See [[w:fr:Flore du massif des Vosges#Hautes chaumes (\u00e9tage subalpin)|''Hautes Chaumes'']]</ref> in the Vosges, which is in a Vosges dialect<ref>See [[w:fr:Vosgien]]</ref> and differs from the initial [[Alsatian dialect]].\n\nMore than [[standard French]], the Lorraine dialect allows a cross-reading of the region's toponyms and makes it possible to establish a correspondence between the two families of languages present on Lorraine's territory. This is one of Lorraine's unique characteristics, its function as a language buffer region, or space between.\n\n== Historical aspects of toponyms in Lorraine ==\n\n=== Definition of terms ===\n\nThe subject of terms is very sensitive. It is linked to recent history, therefore the definition of terms is important.\n\nSince we cannot 'Germanize' what is already Germanic, we must understand the term \"Germanization\" for the periods 1870-1918 and 1940-1945 as an adaptation of form or graphics to [[standard German]] as intended by the heads of state of the last German empires. The Anglo-Saxons speak here rather of 'prussification' to avoid confusion. Moreover, many Moselle toponyms, characteristic of the Franconian Lorraine dialect, also exist in [[Germany]] or [[Austria]]. For a Francophone, Merlebach is objectively no less Germanic than Merlenbach.\n\nThe phenomenon is not specific to Moselle, a large part of Germany, especially in the south, had to willingly adopt standard German names for their official signs, but on the ground, the inhabitants continued to designate their village in the local form. No one is expecting to see 'Stuegert' on a city sign instead of ''[[Stuttgart]]'' today. Even today, an Alsatian and a Mosellan have their local form to designate their agglomeration. This also applies to village names in Lorraine dialect and beyond for all regions of France in local languages and dialects.\n\nThe difference is that Moselle suffered the arrival of 'prussification' as a denial of its specificity in view of the brutality of certain measures that followed the de facto annexation after the abandonment of the territories by the parliament meeting in Bordeaux in May 1871. This annexation was difficult to experience throughout the annexed Moselle because of the desire to 'prussify' Moselle by erasing its specificities. This was experienced as a constraint even in the Lorraine-Franco-speaking (Germanic) areas. It must also be said that part of the annexed Moselle known as [[Bezirk Lothringen]], has always been Romanesque, mainly [[Metzgau]] and Saulnois,<ref>See [[w:fr:Salnois]]</ref> except formerly the [[Dieuze]] region. Here, the Germanization of the toponym is an indisputable fact (Fresnes - Eschen). The locals were forced to change their names. This is why it must always be borne in mind that the phenomenon of \"Germanization\" does not cover the same thing depending on whether you start from an original Romanesque or historically Germanic toponym.\n\nFrench and [[Lorraine Franconian]] (and Alsatian in Alsace) serve to make an ideological and political break with everything that sounds 'Prussian' or 'standardized German', because the occupants forbade or fought them. Thus, a simple 'n' at the end of a local toponym is enough to \"Germanize\" it when it is Germanic: Thedinge becomes Thedingen. At the same time, French francizes the name by removing the dialectal 'e' to give Th\u00e9ding. The accent adds a little more gallicity. As well, it frequently reverses the names from ''-er'' to ''-re''. Diacritical signs such as accents and umlauts have indeed played a role in francization or Germanization (e.g. Buding / B\u00fcdingen). Similarly, the accentuation of names is central. Lorraine Franconian and German emphasize the same linguistic relationship, placing a tonic accent at the initial of words, in general. On the other hand, the French name is unemphasized and is characterized by an increase in tone on the final part of the word. By ear, we can hear the difference between the Germanic and French form.\n\n=== Waves of francization and germanization ===\n\nIn the south of the [[Pays de Nied]],<ref>A toponym used by some scholars (not consistently by all) to more narrowly mean the valley of the [[Nied]] river and the [[Moselle Franconian]] dialect spoken there, as distinction from the other two Franconian dialects spoken in Lorraine: [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] to the west and [[Rhine Franconian]] to the east. See [[Lorraine Franconian]].</ref> there are current toponyms using ''-short'' that were formerly ''-troff'' / ''-torff''. For example, Arraincourt from ''Armestroff'', Thicourt from ''Diederstroff'', Thonville from ''Oderstroff'',<ref>Paul Auguste Pi\u00e9mont, ''La toponymie'' (1969).</ref> Hernicourt (in Herny) from ''Hermerstorf''.\n\nAt the time of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], referring to the sociopolitical system that prevailed in France for the two centuries preceding and up to the French Revolution, several Lorraine towns were recognized by two names, one in French and one in German. The following name-pair examples are found the dictionaries of Henri Lepage<ref name=\"Lepage1862\">[[w:fr:Henri Lepage (historien)]], ''Dictionnaire topographique du d\u00e9partement de la Meurthe'' (1862)</ref> and [[Ernest de Bouteiller]],<ref name=\"Bouteiller1868\">[[Ernest de Bouteiller]], ''Dictionnaire topographique de l'ancien d\u00e9partement de la Moselle : comprenant les noms de lieu anciens et modernes, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en 1868 sous les auspices de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'arch\u00e9ologie et d'histoire de la Moselle'' (Paris: Imprimerie nationale)</ref> respectively, and noted as recognized in 1594:\n\n* [[Mulcey]] was (fr) Mellecey alias (de) Metzingen\n* [[Zommange]] was (fr) Semanges alias (de) Simingen\n* [[Chemery-les-Deux]] was (fr) Clsmey alias (de) Schomberg\n* [[Les \u00c9tangs]] was (de) Tenchen alias (fr) Lestanche\n* Macker<ref>See [[w:fr:Macker]]</ref> was (de) Machern alias (fr) Maizi\u00e8res\n* [[Many, Moselle|Many]] was (de) Niderheim alias (fr) Magny\n* [[Morhange]] was (fr) Morhanges alias (de) Morchingen\n* [[Ottonville]] was (de) Ottendorf alias (fr) Ottonville\n* [[Roupeldange]] was (de) Rupplingen alias (fr) Ruppeldanges\n* [[Suisse, Moselle|Suisse]] was (fr) Xousse alias (de) Soultzen\n* [[Varize, Moselle|Varize]] was (fr) Warize alias (de) Weybelsskirchen\n* Pontigny,<ref name=\"Pontigny\">See [[w:fr:Pontigny (Moselle)]], a locality (or hamlet) in the commune [[Cond\u00e9-Northen]] since 1810</ref> was (de) Nidbr\u00fccken alias (fr) Pont de Niet\n\nThese were certainly not the only spellings before or after 1594. The history for Pontigny, for example, a locality (or hamlet) in the commune [[Cond\u00e9-Northen]] since 1810, is attested as:<ref name=\"Pontigny\" />\n\n* (de) ''Bruque'' 1339\n* (de) ''Br\u00fccke'' 1485\n* (de) ''Nydbr\u00fcck'' alias (fr) ''Pont de Nied'' by the 16th century\n* (de) ''Nidbr\u00fcck'' and (fr) ''Pontnied'' in 1542\n* (de) ''Nidbr\u00fccken'' alias (fr) ''Pont de Niet'' in 1594\n* (de) ''Niedbruch'' in 1606\n* (de) ''Niedbroug'' by the 17th century\n* (fr) ''Pontigni'' 1756\n* (fr) ''Poutigny'' 1793\n* (de) ''Niedbr\u00fccken'' 1940-44\n* (fr) ''Pontigny'' ever since\n\nAnd we can assume further name or spelling differences in the centuries prior, after localities were formed under the Frankish dynasties up to when first attestations are known.\n\nThe names of many communes in Moselle were francized at the end of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], in particular those having the suffix ''-engen'' or ''-ingen'', which was sometimes simplified into ''-ing'' or definitively replaced by the Romanesque form in ''-ing'' (e.g. ''-ingen'' was Romanized into ''-ingas'' and ''-inges'' since the [[Middle Ages]], hence ''-ang''). While in [[Bas Rhin|Bas-Rhin]] ''-ingen'' was preserved. To a lesser extent, this suffix has also been francized over the centuries in other forms, including ''-ang'', ''-in'', ''-court'', ''-gny'', and so forth.\n\nThe toponyms in German-speaking Moselle<ref>See [[w:fr:Moselle germanophone]]</ref> were often spelled ''-willer'' (sometimes ''-weiller'') in the ''[[Bulletin des lois|Bulletins des lois]]'' and several dictionaries from the 19th century until 1870. This form subsequently disappeared in the 20th century, after the World Wars. While in Alsace, the ''-willers'' were preserved, although they were sometimes mentioned ''-viller'' and ''-viler'' in 1793\u20131801.<ref name=\"Cassini\">(In French.) Ldh/EHESS/Cassini - Notices Communales.</ref>\n\nSome municipalities had a [[standard German]] name between 1793 and 1802, such as [[Folschviller]] (''Folschweiler'' 1793), [[\u00c9bersviller]] (''Ebersweiler'' 1793), [[Berviller-en-Moselle]] (''Berweiler'' 1793), [[Schmittviller]] (''Schmittweiler'' 1793), [[Bisten-en-Lorraine]] (''Bisten im Loch'' 1793), [[Ch\u00e2teau-Rouge]] (''Rothdorf'' 1793), [[Mouterhouse]] (''Mutterhausen'' 1801), [[Soucht]] (''Sucht'' 1801), [[Rodalbe]] (''Rodalben'' 1801), Merlebach<ref>Now [[Freyming-Merlebach]], since 1971.</ref> (''Merlenbach'' 1801), [[Dalem, Moselle|Dalem]] (''Dalheim'' 1801), [[Altrippe]] (''Altrippen'' 1793).<ref name=\"Cassini\" />\n\nThe dictionaries of Henri Lepage<ref name=\"Lepage1862\" /> on the [[Meurthe (department)|Meurthe]] and Ernest de Bouteiller<ref name=\"Bouteiller1868\" /> on the [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]], written before 1871, prove that many municipalities still had an alias in German during the 19th century. For example, [[Hagondange]], [[Haute-Vigneulles]], and [[Lorquin]] cited 'in German' as ''Hagelingen'', ''Oberfillen'' and ''L\u0153rchingen'' in these same dictionaries, most recently written in 1868. The Germanization of names by the Prussians from 1871 onwards is therefore not an invention (except in certain cases), which used old Germanic references, sometimes the latest one. For example [[Argancy]] Germanized in ''Argesingen'' during the World War II, refers to an old Germanic mention ''Argesinga'' dating from 848.<ref name=\"Levy1929\">[[w:fr:Paul L\u00e9vy (linguiste)|Paul L\u00e9vy]], ''Histoire linguistique d'Alsace et de Lorraine'' (1929).</ref> and [[Chicourt]] Germanized as ''Diexingen'' (1915-1918) from the ''Diekesinga'' mention from 1121 and 1180 (''-inga'' being the primitive form of ''-ingen'').<ref>(In French.) Onoma - Volume 36 (2001).</ref>\n\nAll the toponyms in the department had been gradually germinized in the German period of the [[Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine|Alsace-Lorraine]]. The place names of German-speaking Lorraine were first Germanized, adjectives (top, bottom...) were then translated, then the names of villages close to the [[linguistic boundary of Moselle]] and the last ones, including all those of French-speaking Moselle,<ref>See [[w:fr:Lorraine romane]]</ref> were Germanized on 2 September 1915 (e.g. [[Augny]]).\n\nAt the end of the First World War in 1918, these place names reverted to their pre-1870 version.\n\nAll toponyms are Germanised after the annexation of 1940, most of the time using their 1918 form or another more or less different one. They were re-francized in 1945.\n\n== Roman / Germanic correspondences ==\n\n=== Comparison of Lorrain appellatives ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|----\n! Roman Lorraine form\n! German form\n!

Counties and cantons can be broken apart. New communes can be formed by joining several localities together. And sometimes through these changes a given name can migrate to a different locality that where it was originally used. Records of such territorial changes are increasingly scarce with the centuries, thus territorial histories tend to obscure with time. Few attestations are available for the founding or change of territory through the late first millennium, but records gradually improve, and by the late second millennium, scholars like Cassini, Lepage, and Boutilleir have largely collated all the toponyms attested in charts concerning the history of [[Austrasia]] into dictionaries and other tombs of reference.\n\nConsider [[Cond\u00e9-Northen]] in Moselle, which began as the ancient commune, Cond\u00e9 (specifically ''Condium'' or ''Condicum''), attested as existing in 787. In 1804, a neighboring commune, Northen, was attached to Cond\u00e9 and the new territory became known by the name it bears today. But the growth did not stop there. In 1810, Pontigny was attached, and finally Loutremange was attached in 1979 by order of a prefectoral decree (''arr\u00eat\u00e9 pr\u00e9fectoral''<ref>An ''arr\u00eat\u00e9 pr\u00e9fectoral'', one of many types of [[w:fr:Arr\u00eat\u00e9 en France|arr\u00eat\u00e9]] (decrees) in France, is basically an officialized granting of the mutual requests of two adjacent communes in the same canton or department to join into a single new municipality with a centralized administration.</ref>). While Northen, Pontigny, and Loutremange are no longer communes, thus no longer considered [[territorial collectivities]], they are still recognized as localities within Cond\u00e9-Northen.\n\nToday we increasingly see communes joining around large cities, where suburban communes grow into each other. For this to be possible, the communes must be adjacent and within the same department. Officials from both communes must jointly request the merger. The new municipality is typically named by hyphenating the two former toponyms together (seemingly in alphabetical order). Examples include [[Ancy-Dornot]] (formerly the communes of Ancy and Dornot<ref name=\"ancy-dornot\">(In French.) [http://mc.moselle.gouv.fr/data/doc-275/20151215/271469_1.pdf Arr\u00eate No. 2015 \u2013 DCTAJ \u2013 1-083 du portant cr\u00e9ation de la commune nouvelle Ancy-Dornot], Pr\u00e9fet de la Moselle, 15 December 2015.</ref>) and [[Freyming-Merlebach]] (formerly Freyming and Merlebach), both in Moselle. Others certainly exist, and more likely will in the future. Municipalities of this kind are formed in the historical region of [[Alsace]] as well.<ref>For example, [[Brunstatt-Didenheim]],</ref>\n\nYet another situation, though more rural and rare, is a large commune originally formed around multiple hamlets, farms, or other lesser localities that are nevertheless on the map. An example here concerns [[M\u00e9tairies-Saint-Quirin]], a relatively new commune formed around 1790 when the jurisdiction of the priory of Saint-Quirin was partially changed, possibly in relation to the [[National Convention]]. The distributed commune's domain originally encompassed eleven large farms, called ''censes'':<ref name=\"cense\">See [[w:fr:Cense]].</ref> Craon (then Cr\u00e9on), Cubolot, Fontaine aux Ch\u00eanes, Halmoze, Heille (or Helde), L'hor, Le Jardinot (becaming Haute-Gueisse during the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]), Jean Limon, La Petite Maladrerie, Rond-Pr\u00e9, and Viller (or Courtegain).<ref>See [[w:fr:M\u00e9tairies-Saint-Quirin]].</ref> Of the original eleven properties making up the commune, only six still remain: Cubolot, Halmoze, Heille, Haute-Gueisse, Jean Limon, and Rond-Pr\u00e9, as found on the [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:M%C3%A9tairies-Saint-Quirin?uselang=fr#/map/0/13/48.6895/7.2711 map of M\u00e9tairies-Saint-Quirin]. The town hall of M\u00e9tairies-Saint-Quirin has been located in Cubolot since 1920.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[German exonyms]]\n* [[List of European exonyms]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Lorraine-German people|Exonym]]\n[[Category:Lists of German exonyms|Moselle]]\n[[Category:Meuse (department)]]\n[[Category:Meurthe-et-Moselle]]\n[[Category:Moselle (department)]]\n[[Category:Vosges (department)]]\n[[Category:Lorraine]]\n[[Category:Names of places in France]]\n", "text_old": "The various toponyms in the historical region of [[Lorraine]] are often known by very different names depending on the language in which they are expressed. This article provides an understanding of the linguistic and historical origin of this diversity and lists a number of correspondences for communes and lesser localities in the four departments of the former region: [[Meuse (department)|Meuse]], [[Meurthe-et-Moselle]], [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]], and [[Vosges (department)|Vosges]].\n\n== Exonyms and endonyms ==\n\nIn the context of toponyms, and with regard to the scope of this article, [[Exonym and endonym|exonyms and endonyms]] are the differing external and internal names, respectively, used by different languages or cultures for a specific geographic place. For the people that speak German and live in Germany, for example, ''Deutschland'' is their endonym for that country. Conversely, ''Allemagne'' is the exonym in French, 'Germany' is the exonym in English, and so on.\n\nThe same idea can apply within a country too, between regions having vastly different linguistical and cultural histories. The emphasis in this article is on those toponyms that began as Gallo-Roman endonyms in some cases, but more often as endonyms following the [[Migration Period|Germanic migrations]], and particularly what emerged from the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] dynasties. Now, more than a millennium later, many of these toponyms have three different names\u2014in [[Lorraine Franconian]], French, and German\u2014due to shifts in culture and language and changes in land possession.\n\n== Linquistical aspects of toponyms in Lorraine ==\n\n=== The 'determinant-determined' of the Romano-Francs ===\n\nThe origin of [Toponymy|toponyms], of which [[Exonym and endonym|exonyms]] are a certain type, is sometimes controversial, especially in [[Lorraine]] where successive or simultaneous occupations by different peoples and changes in culture have often influenced toponymy more than elsewhere.\n\nAs in all regions marked by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] influence, adjectives or appellatives often precede nouns. Many toponyms are formed with the name of a local lord or land owner. In some cases, however, a particular topographical, religious, or historical aspect may have played a more important role, which is difficult to determine in [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]] formations in particular. While [[Gaulish language|Gallic]] toponyms are often poorly clarified due to insufficient knowledge of the language, Romanesque toponyms often play the role of those older Celtic toponyms that have been redesigned in the Romanesque style.\n\nThe [[Ripuarian Franks|Ripuarian]] and [[Salian Franks|Salian]] [[Franks]], and for some time also the [[Alemanni]] in eastern Lorraine, introduced Germanic toponyms. A patronymic practice of the Romano-Francs that developed from the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian Dynasty]] was to merge Roman and Germanic habits. The Germanic rule of word composition from right to left (i.e. the decisive-determined order), largely governs the formation of Lorraine toponyms, both in Germanic and in Roman dialect.\n\nFor example, the Lorraine dialect places the adjective epithet before the noun it describes. A \"white rupt\" is a \"white stream\" (clear and transparent meaning). This is especially true for oronyms and toponyms in localities that make extensive use of local dialect. [[Gerardmer]] (''Giraumou\u00e8'') is the \"Lake of Gerold\", which can therefore be translated in the same order in German language: ''Geroldsee''. The use of ''Geroltzsee'' is attested locally as early as 1484.<ref>(In French.) ''Archives de Meurthe-et-Moselle'', B 739, {{n\u00b0|39}}</ref><ref name=\"Marichal-dict-vosges\">[[Paul Marchal]], ''Dictionnaire topographique du d\u00e9partement des Vosges, comprenant les noms de lieux anciens et modernes'', Paris : Imprimerie nationale, 1941 ({{p.|183}}) [http://cths.fr/dico-topo/affiche-vedettes.php?cdep=88&cpage=183 online].</ref>\n\nThis data is fundamental in Romanesque toponymy and the determining-defined order, sometimes misunderstood, is the rule in [[Normandy]] (except [[Avranchin]]), [[Picardy]], [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]], [[Champagne-Ardenne]], northern [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] and [[\u00cele-de-France]], so it is not surprising that we find this method of composition in Romanesque Lorraine.\n\nIn the west and south, the reverse order \u2014 determined-determinant \u2014 is more dominant. Thus, for example, names like ''Neufch\u00e2teau'', ''Neufch\u00e2tel'', ''Neuville'', and ''Neubourg du nord'' have opposite construction to ''Chateauneuf'', ''Castelnau'', ''Villeneuve'', and ''Bourgneuf'' further south. Even if a Lorrain does not feel completely at home in [[Flanders]] because of the Flemish forms (''-kerque'', ''-em'', ''-hem'', ''-hout'', ''-brouck'', ''-berghe'', ''-dorp'') largely different from German forms, and even more so in Normandy with the Anglo-Norroese appellatives (''-crique-'', ''-ham'', ''-londe'', ''brique-'' [?], ''hougue'' / ''hogue'', Torp(s) / ''-tour(ps))'', they can easily feel a common practice (''-kirch'', ''-om'', ''-heim'', ''-holtz'', ''-bruck'', ''-berg'', ''-troff'' / ''-droff'').\n\nIn German-speaking Lorraine, the word ''dorf'' (for 'village') is often passed to ''troff'' by hardening from /''d''/ to /''t''/ and [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]] from /''r''/.\n\nThe toponyms in ''-angel'' ([[Proto-Germanic language|Common Germanic]] ''-ing'') are typically Lorrainian and correspond to a relatively recent decline in Germanic speaking in Lorraine. Elsewhere this form is exceptional if we except [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Luxembourgish]] part of [[Wallonia]]. In Flanders and [[Artois]], ''-inge'', ''-in'', ''-ain'', its correspondents, are also the expression of a decline in the Flemish language or at least a desire to make toponyms more [[Francization|Gallicized]]. In the Romanesque area, where Germanic speakers disappeared very early, the suffix is found in the forms ''-ans'' in Franche-Comt\u00e9 or Burgundy, in the southwest and a little in Languedoc in the forms ''-eins'', ''-ens'', ''-ein'' and sometimes also ''-ans''. This suffix is much rarer in the west, where it sometimes takes the form of ''-an'' or ''-angles''. Its absence is remarkable in northern Picardy, a region where Romanesque toponymy is the most \"Germanized\" in France.\n\nParadoxically, in Romanesque Lorraine, there is no common series of calls in the north and northwest, whose Germanic origin is proven. Thus, we do not find these types frequently:\n\n* Husdinium of ''*husidinja'' (shelter) in Hodeng, Hodent, Houdan, Hesdin...\n* ''hlar'' (wasteland) in Mouflers, Flers, Meulers...\n* ''ala(c)h'' (temple) in Neauphe, Neaufles, Neauphle or Niafles, and Boffles, Bouafles...\n* ''afisna'' / ''avisna'' (pasture) in Avesnes, Avernes...\n* ''*Rosbaki'' (reed stream) has evolved in Frankish Lorraine in Rohrbach, Rorbach, elsewhere in the north and northwest, and there are Robecq, Rebecques, Rebais, or Rebets...\n\nYou can find toponyms in short from the [[Doubs]] to [[Normandy]], from [[Ile-de-France]] to Walloon Belgium. The ''-court'' toponyms have been chronologically replaced by the ''-ville'' toponyms, of which Romanesque Lorraine is the second 'provider' after Normandy and before the exceptional area of [[Beauce, France|Beauce]]. There are also some in the [[Charentes]] and in the southwest around [[Toulouse]].\n\n=== Lorraine [[diglossia]] ===\n\nIndependent ducal Lorraine included a Bailiwick of Germany<ref>See [[w:fr:Bailliage d'Allemagne]]</ref> that crossed the current Moselle border to the north. The Lorraine Romans referred to all those who spoke a Germanic dialect as 'Germans' as opposed to their Romance language. So a German (or ''Ollemand'') for a Romanesque Lorrain can also be a Lorrain of the Bailiwick of Germany or an Alsatian, or any person living beyond that. Conversely, neighbouring German-speaking people often called the Welsches romanophones.<ref>Welsch is a German word derived from Walh to designate peoples speaking a non-Germanic language, usually Celtic or Romanesque. Welsch (or welche) is also a Romanesque dialect, spoken in the Welsh country of Alsace, and the name given to those who speak it. In Switzerland, Welsch is the familiar nickname given by the German-speaking Swiss to the French-speaking Swiss. See [[w:fr:Welsch]].</ref> This is also the case in Switzerland.\n\nLorraine's toponymy is not only a back-and-forth between the German and French forms more specific to the last two centuries. It is older, and shows a sensitivity common to all of eastern France where the 'determinant-determined' pair largely dominates while respecting habits and rules that ignore the heritage language.\n\nIn the Lorraine of the Ancient Regime Society,<ref name=\"fr-ancient-regime\">See [[w:fr:Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Ancien R\u00e9gime]]</ref> the coexistence of a Romanesque and Germanic form for the same place was not uncommon. It was only with the integration into France under [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski|Stanislaus]] and then under the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin regime]] and Prussian imperialism that both language and toponyms took on a political, patriotic, symbolic and identity value. Previously, the Duke of Lorraine recognized the official existence of German and French on his lands at the risk of having to have the most important acts and charters translated one way or the other. In the regions of passage between the Germanic area and the Romanesque basin, the same place was named in the language of the respective speaker. This is the case for the toponym, ''Hautes Chaumes'',<ref>See [[w:fr:Flore du massif des Vosges#Hautes chaumes (\u00e9tage subalpin)|''Hautes Chaumes'']]</ref> in the Vosges, which is in a Vosges dialect<ref>See [[w:fr:Vosgien]]</ref> and differs from the initial [[Alsatian dialect]].\n\nMore than [[standard French]], the Lorraine dialect allows a cross-reading of the region's toponyms and makes it possible to establish a correspondence between the two families of languages present on Lorraine's territory. This is one of Lorraine's unique characteristics, its function as a language buffer region, or space between.\n\n== Historical aspects of toponyms in Lorraine ==\n\n=== Definition of terms ===\n\nThe subject of terms is very sensitive. It is linked to recent history, therefore the definition of terms is important.\n\nSince we cannot 'Germanize' what is already Germanic, we must understand the term \"Germanization\" for the periods 1870-1918 and 1940-1945 as an adaptation of form or graphics to [[standard German]] as intended by the heads of state of the last German empires. The Anglo-Saxons speak here rather of 'prussification' to avoid confusion. Moreover, many Moselle toponyms, characteristic of the Franconian Lorraine dialect, also exist in [[Germany]] or [[Austria]]. For a Francophone, Merlebach is objectively no less Germanic than Merlenbach.\n\nThe phenomenon is not specific to Moselle, a large part of Germany, especially in the south, had to willingly adopt standard German names for their official signs, but on the ground, the inhabitants continued to designate their village in the local form. No one is expecting to see 'Stuegert' on a city sign instead of ''[[Stuttgart]]'' today. Even today, an Alsatian and a Mosellan have their local form to designate their agglomeration. This also applies to village names in Lorraine dialect and beyond for all regions of France in local languages and dialects.\n\nThe difference is that Moselle suffered the arrival of 'prussification' as a denial of its specificity in view of the brutality of certain measures that followed the de facto annexation after the abandonment of the territories by the parliament meeting in Bordeaux in May 1871. This annexation was difficult to experience throughout the annexed Moselle because of the desire to 'prussify' Moselle by erasing its specificities. This was experienced as a constraint even in the Lorraine-Franco-speaking (Germanic) areas. It must also be said that part of the annexed Moselle known as [[Bezirk Lothringen]], has always been Romanesque, mainly [[Metzgau]] and Saulnois,<ref>See [[w:fr:Salnois]]</ref> except formerly the [[Dieuze]] region. Here, the Germanization of the toponym is an indisputable fact (Fresnes - Eschen). The locals were forced to change their names. This is why it must always be borne in mind that the phenomenon of \"Germanization\" does not cover the same thing depending on whether you start from an original Romanesque or historically Germanic toponym.\n\nFrench and [[Lorraine Franconian]] (and Alsatian in Alsace) serve to make an ideological and political break with everything that sounds 'Prussian' or 'standardized German', because the occupants forbade or fought them. Thus, a simple 'n' at the end of a local toponym is enough to \"Germanize\" it when it is Germanic: Thedinge becomes Thedingen. At the same time, French francizes the name by removing the dialectal 'e' to give Th\u00e9ding. The accent adds a little more gallicity. As well, it frequently reverses the names from ''-er'' to ''-re''. Diacritical signs such as accents and umlauts have indeed played a role in francization or Germanization (e.g. Buding / B\u00fcdingen). Similarly, the accentuation of names is central. Lorraine Franconian and German emphasize the same linguistic relationship, placing a tonic accent at the initial of words, in general. On the other hand, the French name is unemphasized and is characterized by an increase in tone on the final part of the word. By ear, we can hear the difference between the Germanic and French form.\n\n=== Waves of francization and germanization ===\n\nIn the south of the [[Pays de Nied]],<ref>A toponym used by some scholars (not consistently by all) to more narrowly mean the valley of the [[Nied]] river and the [[Moselle Franconian]] dialect spoken there, as distinction from the other two Franconian dialects spoken in Lorraine: [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] to the west and [[Rhine Franconian]] to the east. See [[Lorraine Franconian]].</ref> there are current toponyms using ''-short'' that were formerly ''-troff'' / ''-torff''. For example, Arraincourt from ''Armestroff'', Thicourt from ''Diederstroff'', Thonville from ''Oderstroff'',<ref>Paul Auguste Pi\u00e9mont, ''La toponymie'' (1969).</ref> Hernicourt (in Herny) from ''Hermerstorf''.\n\nAt the time of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], referring to the sociopolitical system that prevailed in France for the two centuries preceding and up to the French Revolution, several Lorraine towns were recognized by two names, one in French and one in German. The following name-pair examples are found the dictionaries of Henri Lepage<ref name=\"Lepage1862\">[[w:fr:Henri Lepage (historien)]], ''Dictionnaire topographique du d\u00e9partement de la Meurthe'' (1862)</ref> and [[Ernest de Bouteiller]],<ref name=\"Bouteiller1868\">[[Ernest de Bouteiller]], ''Dictionnaire topographique de l'ancien d\u00e9partement de la Moselle : comprenant les noms de lieu anciens et modernes, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en 1868 sous les auspices de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'arch\u00e9ologie et d'histoire de la Moselle'' (Paris: Imprimerie nationale)</ref> respectively, and noted as recognized in 1594:\n\n* [[Mulcey]] was (fr) Mellecey alias (de) Metzingen\n* [[Zommange]] was (fr) Semanges alias (de) Simingen\n* [[Chemery-les-Deux]] was (fr) Clsmey alias (de) Schomberg\n* [[Les \u00c9tangs]] was (de) Tenchen alias (fr) Lestanche\n* Macker<ref>See [[w:fr:Macker]]</ref> was (de) Machern alias (fr) Maizi\u00e8res\n* [[Many, Moselle|Many]] was (de) Niderheim alias (fr) Magny\n* [[Morhange]] was (fr) Morhanges alias (de) Morchingen\n* [[Ottonville]] was (de) Ottendorf alias (fr) Ottonville\n* [[Roupeldange]] was (de) Rupplingen alias (fr) Ruppeldanges\n* [[Suisse, Moselle|Suisse]] was (fr) Xousse alias (de) Soultzen\n* [[Varize, Moselle|Varize]] was (fr) Warize alias (de) Weybelsskirchen\n* Pontigny,<ref name=\"Pontigny\">See [[w:fr:Pontigny (Moselle)]], a locality (or hamlet) in the commune [[Cond\u00e9-Northen]] since 1810</ref> was (de) Nidbr\u00fccken alias (fr) Pont de Niet\n\nThese were certainly not the only spellings before or after 1594. The history for Pontigny, for example, a locality (or hamlet) in the commune [[Cond\u00e9-Northen]] since 1810, is attested as:<ref name=\"Pontigny\" />\n\n* (de) ''Bruque'' 1339\n* (de) ''Br\u00fccke'' 1485\n* (de) ''Nydbr\u00fcck'' alias (fr) ''Pont de Nied'' by the 16th century\n* (de) ''Nidbr\u00fcck'' and (fr) ''Pontnied'' in 1542\n* (de) ''Nidbr\u00fccken'' alias (fr) ''Pont de Niet'' in 1594\n* (de) ''Niedbruch'' in 1606\n* (de) ''Niedbroug'' by the 17th century\n* (fr) ''Pontigni'' 1756\n* (fr) ''Poutigny'' 1793\n* (de) ''Niedbr\u00fccken'' 1940-44\n* (fr) ''Pontigny'' ever since\n\nAnd we can assume further name or spelling differences in the centuries prior, after localities were formed under the Frankish dynasties up to when first attestations are known.\n\nThe names of many communes in Moselle were francized at the end of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], in particular those having the suffix ''-engen'' or ''-ingen'', which was sometimes simplified into ''-ing'' or definitively replaced by the Romanesque form in ''-ing'' (e.g. ''-ingen'' was Romanized into ''-ingas'' and ''-inges'' since the [[Middle Ages]], hence ''-ang''). While in [[Bas Rhin|Bas-Rhin]] ''-ingen'' was preserved. To a lesser extent, this suffix has also been francized over the centuries in other forms, including ''-ang'', ''-in'', ''-court'', ''-gny'', and so forth.\n\nThe toponyms in German-speaking Moselle<ref>See [[w:fr:Moselle germanophone]]</ref> were often spelled ''-willer'' (sometimes ''-weiller'') in the ''[[Bulletin des lois|Bulletins des lois]]'' and several dictionaries from the 19th century until 1870. This form subsequently disappeared in the 20th century, after the World Wars. While in Alsace, the ''-willers'' were preserved, although they were sometimes mentioned ''-viller'' and ''-viler'' in 1793\u20131801.<ref name=\"Cassini\">(In French.) Ldh/EHESS/Cassini - Notices Communales.</ref>\n\nSome municipalities had a [[standard German]] name between 1793 and 1802, such as [[Folschviller]] (''Folschweiler'' 1793), [[\u00c9bersviller]] (''Ebersweiler'' 1793), [[Berviller-en-Moselle]] (''Berweiler'' 1793), [[Schmittviller]] (''Schmittweiler'' 1793), [[Bisten-en-Lorraine]] (''Bisten im Loch'' 1793), [[Ch\u00e2teau-Rouge]] (''Rothdorf'' 1793), [[Mouterhouse]] (''Mutterhausen'' 1801), [[Soucht]] (''Sucht'' 1801), [[Rodalbe]] (''Rodalben'' 1801), Merlebach<ref>Now [[Freyming-Merlebach]], since 1971.</ref> (''Merlenbach'' 1801), [[Dalem, Moselle|Dalem]] (''Dalheim'' 1801), [[Altrippe]] (''Altrippen'' 1793).<ref name=\"Cassini\" />\n\nThe dictionaries of Henri Lepage<ref name=\"Lepage1862\" /> on the [[Meurthe (department)|Meurthe]] and Ernest de Bouteiller<ref name=\"Bouteiller1868\" /> on the [[Moselle (department)|Moselle]], written before 1871, prove that many municipalities still had an alias in German during the 19th century. For example, [[Hagondange]], [[Haute-Vigneulles]], and [[Lorquin]] cited 'in German' as ''Hagelingen'', ''Oberfillen'' and ''L\u0153rchingen'' in these same dictionaries, most recently written in 1868. The Germanization of names by the Prussians from 1871 onwards is therefore not an invention (except in certain cases), which used old Germanic references, sometimes the latest one. For example [[Argancy]] Germanized in ''Argesingen'' during the World War II, refers to an old Germanic mention ''Argesinga'' dating from 848.<ref name=\"Levy1929\">[[w:fr:Paul L\u00e9vy (linguiste)|Paul L\u00e9vy]], ''Histoire linguistique d'Alsace et de Lorraine'' (1929).</ref> and [[Chicourt]] Germanized as ''Diexingen'' (1915-1918) from the ''Diekesinga'' mention from 1121 and 1180 (''-inga'' being the primitive form of ''-ingen'').<ref>(In French.) Onoma - Volume 36 (2001).</ref>\n\nAll the toponyms in the department had been gradually germinized in the German period of the [[Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine|Alsace-Lorraine]]. The place names of German-speaking Lorraine were first Germanized, adjectives (top, bottom...) were then translated, then the names of villages close to the [[linguistic boundary of Moselle]] and the last ones, including all those of French-speaking Moselle,<ref>See [[w:fr:Lorraine romane]]</ref> were Germanized on 2 September 1915 (e.g. [[Augny]]).\n\nAt the end of the First World War in 1918, these place names reverted to their pre-1870 version.\n\nAll toponyms are Germanised after the annexation of 1940, most of the time using their 1918 form or another more or less different one. They were re-francized in 1945.\n\n== Roman / Germanic correspondences ==\n\n=== Comparison of Lorrain appellatives ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|----\n! Roman Lorraine form\n! German form\n!

Counties and cantons can be broken apart. New communes can be formed by joining several localities together. And sometimes through these changes a given name can migrate to a different locality that where it was originally used. Records of such territorial changes are increasingly scarce with the centuries, thus territorial histories tend to obscure with time. Few attestations are available for the founding or change of territory through the late first millennium, but records gradually improve, and by the late second millennium, scholars like Cassini, Lepage, and Boutilleir have largely collated all the toponyms attested in charts concerning the history of [[Austrasia]] into dictionaries and other tombs of reference.\n\nConsider [[Cond\u00e9-Northen]] in Moselle, which began as the ancient commune, Cond\u00e9 (specifically ''Condium'' or ''Condicum''), attested as existing in 787. In 1804, a neighboring commune, Northen, was attached to Cond\u00e9 and the new territory became known by the name it bears today. But the growth did not stop there. In 1810, Pontigny was attached, and finally Loutremange was attached in 1979 by order of a prefectoral decree (''arr\u00eat\u00e9 pr\u00e9fectoral''<ref>An ''arr\u00eat\u00e9 pr\u00e9fectoral'', one of many types of [[w:fr:Arr\u00eat\u00e9 en France|arr\u00eat\u00e9]] (decrees) in France, is basically an officialized granting of the mutual requests of two adjacent communes in the same canton or department to join into a single new municipality with a centralized administration.</ref>). While Northen, Pontigny, and Loutremange are no longer communes, thus no longer considered [[territorial collectivities]], they are still recognized as localities within Cond\u00e9-Northen.\n\nToday we increasingly see communes joining around large cities, where suburban communes grow into each other. For this to be possible, the communes must be adjacent and within the same department. Officials from both communes must jointly request the merger. The new municipality is typically named by hyphenating the two former toponyms together (seemingly in alphabetical order). Examples include [[Ancy-Dornot]] (formerly the communes of Ancy and Dornot<ref name=\"ancy-dornot\">(In French.) [http://mc.moselle.gouv.fr/data/doc-275/20151215/271469_1.pdf Arr\u00eate No. 2015 \u2013 DCTAJ \u2013 1-083 du portant cr\u00e9ation de la commune nouvelle Ancy-Dornot], Pr\u00e9fet de la Moselle, 15 December 2015.</ref>) and [[Freyming-Merlebach]] (formerly Freyming and Merlebach), both in Moselle. Others certainly exist, and more likely will in the future. Municipalities of this kind are formed in the historical region of [[Alsace]] as well.<ref>For example, [[Brunstatt-Didenheim]],</ref>\n\nYet another situation, though more rural and rare, is a large commune originally formed around multiple hamlets, farms, or other lesser localities that are nevertheless on the map. An example here concerns [[M\u00e9tairies-Saint-Quirin]], a relatively new commune formed around 1790 when the jurisdiction of the priory of Saint-Quirin was partially changed, possibly in relation to the [[National Convention]]. The distributed commune's domain originally encompassed eleven large farms, called ''censes'':<ref name=\"cense\">See [[w:fr:Cense]].</ref> Craon (then Cr\u00e9on), Cubolot, Fontaine aux Ch\u00eanes, Halmoze, Heille (or Helde), L'hor, Le Jardinot (becaming Haute-Gueisse during the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]), Jean Limon, La Petite Maladrerie, Rond-Pr\u00e9, and Viller (or Courtegain).<ref>See [[w:fr:M\u00e9tairies-Saint-Quirin]].</ref> Of the original eleven properties making up the commune, only six still remain: Cubolot, Halmoze, Heille, Haute-Gueisse, Jean Limon, and Rond-Pr\u00e9, as found on the [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:M%C3%A9tairies-Saint-Quirin?uselang=fr#/map/0/13/48.6895/7.2711 map of M\u00e9tairies-Saint-Quirin]. The town hall of M\u00e9tairies-Saint-Quirin has been located in Cubolot since 1920.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[German exonyms]]\n* [[List of European exonyms]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Lorraine-German people|Exonym]]\n[[Category:Lists of German exonyms|Moselle]]\n[[Category:Meuse (department)]]\n[[Category:Meurthe-et-Moselle]]\n[[Category:Moselle (department)]]\n[[Category:Vosges (department)]]\n[[Category:Lorraine]]\n[[Category:Names of places in France]]\n", "name_user": "Iamvered", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed Morainville; it was \"???\" and furthermore it isn't in Lorraine, it's in the Centre-Val-de-Loire region", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_of_Lorraine_toponyms_in_French_and_German"}

It was commissioned by the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in 1931 and conceived by [[Stanley Morison]], the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]], in collaboration with [[Victor Lardent]], a lettering artist in ''The Times's'' advertising department. It has become one of the most popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most [[desktop computer]]s.\n\nAsked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that ''The Times'' change their text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before. This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]] as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in ''The Times'' on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or [[Roman type|roman]] style (sometimes also called [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|Antiqua]]), the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman's design has no connection to [[Rome]] or to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\n''The Times'' stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from [[broadsheet]] to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] in 2004 have caused it to switch typeface five times from 1972 to 2007. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman typeface.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Times New Roman and predecessor.jpg|thumb|right|Twenty-two lines in Times New Roman compared to its predecessor \"modern\" serif font.{{efn|\"Modern\" in typography is a generic term referring to designs in the [[Didone (typography)|modern or Didone]] style of the nineteenth century.}} Times appears larger on the page, with tighter linespacing and more solid in appearance.<ref name=\"Printing the Times 1932\">{{cite book |title=Printing the Times: A record of the changes introduced in the issue for October 3, 1932 |date=1932 |location=London}}</ref>]]\nTimes New Roman has a robust [[Type color|colour]] on the page and influences of European [[Early modern period|early modern]] and [[Baroque period|Baroque]] printing.<ref name=\"Monotype Recorder: The Changing Newspaper\">{{cite journal|first=Stanley|last=Morison|title=Monotype Recorder: The Changing Newspaper|journal=Monotype Recorder|volume=35|issue=1|date=1936|url=http://www.metaltype.co.uk/downloads/mr/mr_35_1.pdf}}</ref>{{efn|\"The Changing Newspaper\" articles in the ''Monotype Recorder'' are unsigned, but Monotype's newspaper consultant Allen Hutt, who co-authored the issue, attributes them to Morison.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=263}}}} As a typeface designed for newspaper printing, Times New Roman has a high [[x-height]], short [[descender]]s to allow tight linespacing and a relatively condensed appearance.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=117}}{{efn|While Times is often described as being quite \"condensed\" this is relative to its high x-height: typefaces with lower x-height, such as many versions of [[Garamond]], [[Caslon]] and [[Bembo]], are narrower at equalised cap height. Although Hutt,{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=261}} and most other authors, describe Times New Roman as having a higher x-height than Plantin, Tracy reports based on published Monotype dimensions that in the original small metal-type sizes the difference was not great.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=197}}}}\n\n[[File:Times ancestors.png|thumb|A digitisation of Times New Roman below the three typefaces originally considered as a basis for the ''Times'' project: [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]], [[Baskerville]] and [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]].

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point [[Body (typography)|bodies]]. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing. Monotype took advantage of this popularity by commissioning a widened version, Series 427, for book publishing, although many books ultimately used the original version.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=103}}\n\nAn early use of Times New Roman outside its origin was by [[Daniel Berkeley Updike]], an influential historian of printing with whom Morison carried an extensive correspondence.

Users found that in the hot metal period it was common for the molten metal to rapidly eat through the matrices as type was being cast, and so it did not become popular among other newspapers: \"Times Roman achieved its popularity chiefly in general printing, not in newspaper work.\"{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} He described it as particularly used in \"book work, especially non-fiction\" such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} Hutt also commented that Times New Roman's relative condensation was less useful than might be expected for newspaper printing, since in a normal newspaper column frequent paragraph breaks tend to provide area that can absorb the space of wider letters without increasing the number of lines used\u2013but ''The Times'', whose [[Style guide|house style]] in the 1930s was to minimise the number of paragraph breaks, was an exception to this.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=264}}\n\nTimes New Roman remains popular in publishing, helped by the extremely large range of characters available for international and mathematics printing.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=102}}<ref name=\"Es gilt das gesprochene Wort\">{{cite web |last1=Bergmann |first1=Christopher |title=Es gilt das gesprochene Wort: Schriftarten f\u00fcr IPA-Transkriptionen |url=https://www.isoglosse.de/2014/03/schriftarten-ipa-transkriptionen/ |website=Isoglosse |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> For example, the [[American Psychological Association]] suggests using Times New Roman in papers written in its [[APA style]].<ref name=\"APA Style Blog\">{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Chelsea |title=Fonts of Knowledge |url=https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2013/03/fonts-of-knowledge.html |website=APA Style Blog |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n==Linotype releases==\n[[File:Many accented a (8277806822).jpg|thumb|Working drawings for a Linotype release of \"Times Roman\".

Linotype referred to the design as ''Times'' or ''Times Roman''. Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but slight differences have split the lineage of Times into two subtly different designs.\n\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to [[cold type|photo]] and digital media. For example, Linotype has slanted [[serif]]s on the capital S, while Monotype's are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5.<ref name=\"Strizver TypeTalk\">{{cite web|first=Ilene|last=Strizver|url=http://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-times-roman-vs-times-new-roman|title=TypeTalk: Times Roman vs Times New Roman|work=CreativePro.com}}</ref> Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details as well as the width metrics for their version of Times grew apart.<ref name=\"times-development\" /> Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight, (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight){{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} and in the percent sign in all weights. (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not.) Monotype's 'J' is non-descending, but Linotype's in the bold weight descends below the baseline.\n\nLinotype licensed its version to [[Xerox]] and then [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the [[PostScript]] page description language.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/|website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Microsoft's version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name.

In the 1980s, there was an attempt by a group of entrepreneurs to seek from [[Rupert Murdoch]], who owned ''The Times'', the right to use the Times Roman name; separately, a legal action was also initiated to clarify the right of Monotype to use the name in the US despite Linotype's registration.

It was commissioned by the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in 1931 and conceived by [[Stanley Morison]], the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]], in collaboration with [[Victor Lardent]], a lettering artist in ''The Times's'' advertising department. It has become one of the most popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most [[desktop computer]]s.\n\nAsked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that ''The Times'' change their text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before. This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]] as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in ''The Times'' on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or [[Roman type|roman]] style (sometimes also called [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|Antiqua]]), the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed.

Morison edited the History of the Times from 1935 to 1952, and in the post-war period, at a time when Monotype effectively stopped developing new typefaces due to [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)#Age of Austerity|pressures of austerity]], took a post as editor of the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' which he held from 1945 to 1948. Times New Roman remained Morison's only type design; he designed a type to be issued by the [[Bauer Type Foundry]] of Frankfurt but the project was abandoned due to the war.

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point [[Body (typography)|bodies]]. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing.

Users found that in the hot metal period it was common for the molten metal to rapidly eat through the matrices as type was being cast, and so it did not become popular among other newspapers: \"Times Roman achieved its popularity chiefly in general printing, not in newspaper work.\"{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} He described it as particularly used in \"book work, especially non-fiction\" such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} Hutt also commented that Times New Roman's relative condensation was less useful than might be expected for newspaper printing, since in a normal newspaper column frequent paragraph breaks tend to provide area that can absorb the space of wider letters without increasing the number of lines used\u2013but ''The Times'', whose [[Style guide|house style]] in the 1930s was to minimise the number of paragraph breaks, was an exception to this.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=264}}\n\nTimes New Roman remains popular in publishing, helped by the extremely large range of characters available for international and mathematics printing.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=102}}<ref name=\"Es gilt das gesprochene Wort\">{{cite web |last1=Bergmann |first1=Christopher |title=Es gilt das gesprochene Wort: Schriftarten f\u00fcr IPA-Transkriptionen |url=https://www.isoglosse.de/2014/03/schriftarten-ipa-transkriptionen/ |website=Isoglosse |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> For example, the [[American Psychological Association]] suggests using Times New Roman in papers written in its [[APA style]].<ref name=\"APA Style Blog\">{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Chelsea |title=Fonts of Knowledge |url=https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2013/03/fonts-of-knowledge.html |website=APA Style Blog |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n==Linotype releases==\n[[File:Many accented a (8277806822).jpg|thumb|Working drawings for a Linotype release of \"Times Roman\".

Linotype referred to the design as ''Times'' or ''Times Roman''. Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but slight differences have split the lineage of Times into two subtly different designs.\n\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to [[cold type|photo]] and digital media. For example, Linotype has slanted [[serif]]s on the capital S, while Monotype's are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5.<ref name=\"Strizver TypeTalk\">{{cite web|first=Ilene|last=Strizver|url=http://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-times-roman-vs-times-new-roman|title=TypeTalk: Times Roman vs Times New Roman|work=CreativePro.com}}</ref> Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details as well as the width metrics for their version of Times grew apart.<ref name=\"times-development\" /> Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight, (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight){{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} and in the percent sign in all weights. (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not.) Monotype's 'J' is non-descending, but Linotype's in the bold weight descends below the baseline.\n\nLinotype licensed its version to [[Xerox]] and then [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the [[PostScript]] page description language.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/|website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Microsoft's version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name.

Sys.: Algo. and Evaluation }}</ref> Current recommender systems typically combine one or more approaches into a hybrid system.\n\nThe differences between collaborative and content-based filtering can be demonstrated by comparing two early music recommender systems \u2013 [[Last.fm]] and [[Pandora Radio]].\n* Last.fm creates a \"station\" of recommended songs by observing what bands and individual tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those against the listening behavior of other users. Last.fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user's library, but are often played by other users with similar interests. As this approach leverages the behavior of users, it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique.\n* Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist (a subset of the 400 attributes provided by the [[Music Genome Project]]) to seed a \"station\" that plays music with similar properties. User feedback is used to refine the station's results, deemphasizing certain attributes when a user \"dislikes\" a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user \"likes\" a song. This is an example of a content-based approach.\n\nEach type of system has its strengths and weaknesses. In the above example, Last.fm requires a large amount of information about a user to make accurate recommendations. This is an example of the [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]] problem, and is common in collaborative filtering systems.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=ChenHung-Hsuan|last2=ChenPu|date=2019-01-09|title=Differentiating Regularization Weights -- A Simple Mechanism to Alleviate Cold Start in Recommender Systems|journal=ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD)|volume=13|pages=1\u201322|language=EN|doi=10.1145/3285954}}</ref><ref name=\"rubens2016\">{{cite book\n|last1=Rubens |first1=Neil\n|last2= [https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdielahi Elahi]|first2=Mehdi\n |last3=Sugiyama|first3=Masashi|last4=Kaplan|first4=Dain|editor1-last=Ricci\n |editor1-first=Francesco\n |editor2-last=Rokach|editor2-first=Lior\n |editor3-last=Shapira |editor3-first=Bracha\n |title=Recommender Systems Handbook\n |date=2016\n |publisher=Springer US\n |isbn=978-1-4899-7637-6\n |edition=2\n |chapter=Active Learning in Recommender Systems\n |chapter-url = https://rd.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6\n|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6_24\n}}</ref><ref name=\"elahi2016\">\n{{cite journal|last1= [https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdielahi Elahi]|first1=Mehdi\n|last2= [http://www.inf.unibz.it/~ricci/ Ricci]|first2=Francesco\n|last3=Rubens|first3=Neil\n|title=A survey of active learning in collaborative filtering recommender systems|journal=Computer Science Review\n|volume=20\n|pages=29\u201350\n|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303781992|doi=10.1016/j.cosrev.2016.05.002\n|year=2016\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"schein02\">\n{{cite conference |author = Andrew I.

The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items. By locating peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current user or item, they generate recommendations using this neighborhood.Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model-based. A well-known example of memory-based approaches is the user-based algorithm,<ref>{{cite report|author1=Breese, John S.|author2=Heckerman, David|author3=Kadie, Carl|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69656/tr-98-12.pdf|title=Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering|year=1998|publisher=Microsoft Research}}</ref> while that of model-based approaches is the [[Kernel-Mapping Recommender]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Kernel-Mapping Recommender system algorithms|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2012.04.012|volume=208|journal=Information Sciences|pages=81\u2013104|date=2012-11-15|last1=Ghazanfar|first1=Mustansar Ali|last2=Pr\u00fcgel-Bennett|first2=Adam|last3=Szedmak|first3=Sandor|citeseerx=10.1.1.701.7729}}</ref>\n\nA key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an \"understanding\" of the item itself. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems. For example, the [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|k-nearest neighbor]] (k-NN) approach<ref>{{cite web |last = Sarwar |first = B. |last2 = Karypis |first2 = G. |last3 = Konstan |first3 = J. |last4 = Riedl |first4 = J. |year = 2000 |url = http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/node/122 |title = Application of Dimensionality Reduction in Recommender System A Case Study }},</ref> and the [[Pearson correlation|Pearson Correlation]] as first implemented by Allen.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Allen | first = R.B. | date=1990 | title=User Models: Theory, Method, Practice| publisher = International J. Man-Machine Studies}}</ref>\n\nWhen building a model from a user's behavior, a distinction is often made between explicit and [[implicit data collection|implicit]] forms of [[data collection]].\n\nExamples of explicit data collection include the following:\n* Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.\n* Asking a user to search.\n* Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.\n* Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them.\n* Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes (see ''[[Rocchio algorithm|Rocchio classification]]'' or other similar techniques).\n\nExamples of [[implicit data collection]] include the following:\n* Observing the items that a user views in an online store.\n* Analyzing item/user viewing times.<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Parsons |first = J. |last2 = Ralph |first2 = P. |last3 = Gallagher |first3 = K. |date = July 2004 |title = Using viewing time to infer user preference in recommender systems |publisher = AAAI Workshop in Semantic Web Personalization, San Jose, California }}.</ref>\n* Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online.\n* Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer.\n* Analyzing the user's social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes.\n\nCollaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems: [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]], scalability, and sparsity.<ref name=\"Lee2007\">Sanghack Lee and Jihoon Yang and Sung-Yong Park, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u4qzlZAEjegC&pg=PA396&lpg=PA396&dq=sparsity+problem+content-based&source=bl&ots=ZEI50fmXTh&sig=jcwEba0LykRiLnYVbLYUwdrHYEo&hl=en&ei=-W7CTvboCIeHsgKf9NHDBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sparsity%20problem%20content-based&f=false Discovery of Hidden Similarity on Collaborative Filtering to Overcome Sparsity Problem], Discovery Science, 2007.</ref>\n* '''Cold start''': For a new user or item, there isn't enough data to make accurate recommendations.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"rubens2016\"/><ref name=\"elahi2016\"/>\n* '''Scalability''': In many of the environments in which these systems make recommendations, there are millions of users and products.

The most active users will only have rated a small subset of the overall database. Thus, even the most popular items have very few ratings.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y), an algorithm popularized by [[Amazon.com]]'s recommender system.<ref name=\"patft.uspto.gov\">[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=6,266,649.PN.&OS=PN/6,266,649&RS=PN/6,266,649 Collaborative Recommendations Using Item-to-Item Similarity Mappings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316185024/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=6%2C266%2C649.PN.&OS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649&RS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649 |date=2015-03-16 }}</ref>\n\nMany [[social networks]] originally used collaborative filtering to recommend new friends, groups, and other social connections by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends.<ref name=\"handbook\">Francesco Ricci and Lior Rokach and Bracha Shapira, [http://www.inf.unibz.it/~ricci/papers/intro-rec-sys-handbook.pdf Introduction to Recommender Systems Handbook], Recommender Systems Handbook, Springer, 2011, pp. 1-35</ref> Collaborative filtering is still used as part of hybrid systems.\n\n=== Content-based filtering ===\n\nAnother common approach when designing recommender systems is '''content-based filtering'''.

Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on an item's features.\n\nIn this system, keywords are used to describe the items and a [[user profile]] is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past, or is examining in the present. It does not rely on a user sign-in mechanism to generate this often temporary profile. In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended. This approach has its roots in [[information retrieval]] and [[information filtering]] research.\n\nTo create a [[user profile]], the system mostly focuses on two types of information:\n\n1. A model of the user's preference.\n\n2. A history of the user's interaction with the recommender system.\n\nBasically, these methods use an item profile (i.e., a set of discrete attributes and features) characterizing the item within the system. To abstract the features of the items in the system, an item presentation algorithm is applied. A widely used algorithm is the [[tf\u2013idf]] representation (also called vector space representation).<ref>D.H. Wang, Y.C. Liang, D.Xu, X.Y. Feng, R.C. Guan(2018), \"[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705118302107 A content-based recommender system for computer science publications]\", ''[[Knowledge-Based Systems]]'', 157: 1-9</ref> The system creates a content-based profile of users based on a weighted vector of item features. The weights denote the importance of each feature to the user and can be computed from individually rated content vectors using a variety of techniques. Simple approaches use the average values of the rated item vector while other sophisticated methods use machine learning techniques such as [[Naive Bayes classifier|Bayesian Classifiers]], [[cluster analysis]], [[decision trees]], and [[artificial neural networks]] in order to estimate the probability that the user is going to like the item.<ref>{{cite news|title=Online Recommender Systems \u2013 How Does a Website Know What I Want?|url=http://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2015/05/25/online-recommender-systems-website-want/|last=Blanda, Stephanie|work=American Mathematical Society|date=May 25, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA key issue with content-based filtering is whether the system is able to learn user preferences from users' actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types. When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using, the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended. For example, recommending news articles based on browsing of news is useful, but would be much more useful when music, videos, products, discussions etc. from different services can be recommended based on news browsing. To overcome this, most content-based recommender systems now use some form of hybrid system.\n\nContent-based recommender systems can also include opinion-based recommender systems. In some cases, users are allowed to leave text review or feedback on the items. These user-generated texts are implicit data for the recommender system because they are potentially rich resource of both feature/aspects of the item, and users' evaluation/sentiment to the item. Features extracted from the user-generated reviews are improved [[Metadata|meta-data]] of items, because as they also reflect aspects of the item like [[Metadata|meta-data]], extracted features are widely concerned by the users. Sentiments extracted from the reviews can be seen as users' rating scores on the corresponding features. Popular approaches of opinion-based recommender system utilize various techniques including [[text mining]], [[information retrieval]], [[sentiment analysis]] (see also [[Multimodal sentiment analysis]]) and deep learning <ref>X.Y.

Instead of developing recommendation techniques based on a single criterion value, the overall preference of user u for the item i, these systems try to predict a rating for unexplored items of u by exploiting preference information on multiple criteria that affect this overall preference value. Several researchers approach MCRS as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and apply MCDM methods and techniques to implement MCRS systems.<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Lakiotaki |first = K. |last2 = Matsatsinis |last3 = Tsoukias |first3 = A |title = Multicriteria User Modeling in Recommender Systems |journal = IEEE Intelligent Systems |volume = 26 |issue = 2 |pages = 64\u201376 |doi=10.1109/mis.2011.33|date = March 2011 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.476.6726 }}</ref> See this chapter<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |title=Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems |authors=Gediminas Adomavicius, Nikos Manouselis, YoungOk Kwon |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630021251/http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-30 }}</ref> for an extended introduction.\n\n=== Risk-aware recommender systems ===\nThe majority of existing approaches to recommender systems focus on recommending the most relevant content to users using contextual information, yet do not take into account the risk of disturbing the user with unwanted notifications. It is important to consider the risk of upsetting the user by pushing recommendations in certain circumstances, for instance, during a professional meeting, early morning, or late at night. Therefore, the performance of the recommender system depends in part on the degree to which it has incorporated the risk into the recommendation process. One option to manage this issue is ''DRARS'', a system which models the context-aware recommendation as a [[Multi-armed bandit|bandit problem]]. This system combines a content-based technique and a contextual bandit algorithm.<ref name=\"Bouneffouf2013\">{{citation | type=Ph.D.\n | last = Bouneffouf  | first = Djallel | title= DRARS, A Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System\n | publisher = Institut National des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications | year = 2013 | url = http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01026136/fr/}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile recommender systems ===\n{{see|Location based recommendation}}\nMobile recommender systems make use of internet-accessing [[smart phones]] to offer personalized, context-sensitive recommendations.

It uses this data to recommend a list of pickup points along a route, with the goal of optimizing occupancy times and profits.\n\nMobile recommendation systems have also been successfully built using the \"Web of Data\" as a source for structured information. A good example of such system is SMARTMUSEUM<ref name=\"Ruotsalo2013\">{{cite journal |author1=Tuukka Ruotsalo |author2=Krister Haav |author3=Antony Stoyanov |author4=Sylvain Roche |author5=Elena Fani |author6=Romina Deliai |author7=Eetu M\u00e4kel\u00e4 |author8=Tomi Kauppinen |author9=Eero Hyv\u00f6nen | title = SMARTMUSEUM: A Mobile Recommender System for the Web of Data | pages = 657\u2013662 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.websem.2013.03.001 | volume=20 | journal=Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web|citeseerx=10.1.1.676.7109 }}\n</ref> The system uses semantic modelling, information retrieval, and machine learning\ntechniques in order to recommend content matching user interests, even when presented with sparse or minimal user data.\n\n=== Hybrid recommender systems ===\n\nMost recommender systems now use a hybrid approach, combining [[collaborative filtering]], content-based filtering, and other approaches . There is no reason why several different techniques of the same type could not be hybridized. Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways: by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them; by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa); or by unifying the approaches into one model (see<ref name=\"Toward the Next Generation of Recommender Systems\" /> for a complete review of recommender systems). Several studies that empirically compare the performance of the hybrid with the pure collaborative and content-based methods and demonstrated that the hybrid methods can provide more accurate\nrecommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem, as well as the knowledge engineering bottleneck in [[Knowledge base|knowledge-based]] approaches.<ref>Rinke Hoekstra, [http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj32.pdf The Knowledge Reengineering Bottleneck], Semantic Web \u2013 Interoperability, Usability, Applicability 1 (2010) 1, IOS Press</ref>\n\n[[Netflix]] is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gomez-Uribe|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Hunt|first2=Neil|title=The Netflix Recommender System|journal=ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems|date=28 December 2015|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1\u201319|doi=10.1145/2843948}}</ref> The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).\n\nSome hybridization techniques include:\n*'''Weighted''': Combining the score of different recommendation components numerically.\n*'''Switching''': Choosing among recommendation components and applying the selected one.\n*'''Mixed''': Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation.\n*'''Feature Combination''': Features derived from different knowledge sources are combined together and given to a single recommendation algorithm.\n*'''Feature Augmentation''': Computing a feature or set of features, which is then part of the input to the next technique.\n*'''Cascade''': Recommenders are given strict priority, with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones.\n*'''Meta-level''': One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model, which is then the input used by the next technique.<ref name=hybrids>Robin Burke, [http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~acristea/courses/CS411/2010/Book%20-%20The%20Adaptive%20Web/HybridWebRecommenderSystems.pdf Hybrid Web Recommender Systems] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912085014/http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~acristea/courses/CS411/2010/Book%20-%20The%20Adaptive%20Web/HybridWebRecommenderSystems.pdf |date=2014-09-12 }}, pp. 377-408, The Adaptive Web, Peter Brusilovsky, Alfred Kobsa, Wolfgang Nejdl (Ed.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 4321, May 2007, 978-3-540-72078-2.</ref>\n\n== The Netflix Prize ==\n{{Main|Netflix Prize}}\n\nOne of the events that energized research in recommender systems was the [[Netflix Prize]]. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix sponsored a competition, offering a grand prize of $1,000,000 to the team that could take an offered dataset of over 100 million movie ratings and return recommendations that were 10% more accurate than those offered by the company's existing recommender system. This competition energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms. On 21 September 2009, the grand prize of US$1,000,000 was given to the BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team using tiebreaking rules.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|last1=Lohr|first1=Steve|title=A $1 Million Research Bargain for Netflix, and Maybe a Model for Others|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/22/technology/internet/22netflix.html|website=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nThe most accurate algorithm in 2007 used an ensemble method of 107 different algorithmic approaches, blended into a single prediction.

To measure the [[effectiveness]] of recommender systems, and compare different approaches, three types of [[evaluation]]s are available: user studies, [[A/B testing|online evaluations (A/B tests)]], and offline evaluations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe commonly used metrics are the [[mean squared error]] and [[root mean squared error]], the latter having been used in the Netflix Prize. The information retrieval metrics such as [[precision and recall]] or [[Discounted Cumulative Gain|DCG]] are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method. Diversity, novelty, and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation.<ref>Lathia, N., Hailes, S., Capra, L., Amatriain, X.: [http://www.academia.edu/download/46585553/lathia_sigir10.pdf Temporal diversity in recommender systems]. In: Proceedings of the 33rd International ACMSIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2010, pp. 210\u2013217. ACM, New York</ref> However, many of the classic evaluation measures are highly criticized.<ref name=\"Turpin2001\">{{cite book| author=Turpin, Andrew H, Hersh, William| chapter=Why batch and user evaluations do not give the same results| title=Proceedings of the 24th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval| year=2001| pages=225\u2013231}}</ref>\n\nUser studies are rather small scale. A few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches, and then the users judge which recommendations are best. In A/B tests, recommendations are shown to typically thousands of users of a real product, and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations. The effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as [[conversion rate]] or [[click-through rate]]. Offline evaluations are based on historic data, e.g. a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/|title=MovieLens dataset|last=|first=|date=2013-09-06|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of recommendation approaches is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users' ratings in the dataset. While a rating is an explicit expression of whether a user liked a movie, such information is not available in all domains. For instance, in the domain of citation recommender systems, users typically do not rate a citation or recommended article. In such cases, offline evaluations may use implicit measures of effectiveness. For instance, it may be assumed that a recommender system is effective that is able to recommend as many articles as possible that are contained in a research article's reference list. However, this kind of offline evaluations is seen critical by many researchers.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=ChenHung-Hsuan|last2=ChungChu-An|last3=HuangHsin-Chien|last4=TsuiWen|date=2017-09-01|title=Common Pitfalls in Training and Evaluating Recommender Systems|journal=ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter|volume=19|pages=37\u201345|language=EN|doi=10.1145/3137597.3137601}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization|last=Jannach|first=Dietmar|last2=Lerche|first2=Lukas|last3=Gedikli|first3=Fatih|last4=Bonnin|first4=Geoffray|date=2013-06-10|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642388439|editor-last=Carberry|editor-first=Sandra|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=25\u201337|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38844-6_3|editor-last2=Weibelzahl|editor-first2=Stephan|editor-last3=Micarelli|editor-first3=Alessandro|editor-last4=Semeraro|editor-first4=Giovanni|citeseerx = 10.1.1.465.96}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Turpin|first=Andrew H.|last2=Hersh|first2=William|date=2001-01-01|title=Why Batch and User Evaluations Do Not Give the Same Results|journal=Proceedings of the 24th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval|series=SIGIR '01|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=[https://archive.org/details/proceedingsof24t0000inte/page/225 225\u2013231]|doi=10.1145/383952.383992|isbn=978-1581133318|citeseerx=10.1.1.165.5800|url=https://archive.org/details/proceedingsof24t0000inte/page/225}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> For instance, it has been shown that results of offline evaluations have low correlation with results from user studies or A/B tests.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries|volume = 9316|last1=Langer|first1=Stefan|date=2015-09-14|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319245911|editor-last=Kapidakis|editor-first=Sarantos|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=153\u2013168|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-24592-8_12|editor-last2=Mazurek|editor-first2=Cezary|editor-last3=Werla|editor-first3=Marcin|chapter = A Comparison of Offline Evaluations, Online Evaluations, and User Studies in the Context of Research-Paper Recommender Systems}}</ref> A dataset popular for offline evaluation has been shown to contain duplicate data and thus to lead to wrong conclusions in the evaluation of algorithms.<ref name=\"BasaranNtoutsi2017\">{{cite book|last1=Basaran|first1=Daniel|title=Proceedings of the 2017 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining|last2=Ntoutsi|first2=Eirini|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|year=2017|pages=390\u2013398|doi=10.1137/1.9781611974973.44|isbn=978-1-61197-497-3}}</ref> Often, results of so-called offline evaluations do not correlate with actually assessed user-satisfaction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beel|first=Joeran|last2=Genzmehr|first2=Marcel|last3=Langer|first3=Stefan|last4=N\u00fcrnberger|first4=Andreas|last5=Gipp|first5=Bela|date=2013-01-01|title=A Comparative Analysis of Offline and Online Evaluations and Discussion of Research Paper Recommender System Evaluation|journal=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Reproducibility and Replication in Recommender Systems Evaluation|series=RepSys '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=7\u201314|doi=10.1145/2532508.2532511|isbn=9781450324656|citeseerx=10.1.1.1031.973}}</ref> This is probably because offline training is highly biased toward the highly reachable items, and offline testing data is highly influenced by the outputs of the online recommendation module.<ref name=\":4\" /> Researchers have concluded that the results of offline evaluations should be viewed critically.\n\n=== Beyond accuracy ===\nTypically, research on recommender systems is concerned about finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms.

Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user's past behavior (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users.

Sys.: Algo. and Evaluation }}</ref> Current recommender systems typically combine one or more approaches into a hybrid system.\n\nThe differences between collaborative and content-based filtering can be demonstrated by comparing two early music recommender systems \u2013 [[Last.fm]] and [[Pandora Radio]].\n* Last.fm creates a \"station\" of recommended songs by observing what bands and individual tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those against the listening behavior of other users. Last.fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user's library, but are often played by other users with similar interests. As this approach leverages the behavior of users, it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique.\n* Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist (a subset of the 400 attributes provided by the [[Music Genome Project]]) to seed a \"station\" that plays music with similar properties. User feedback is used to refine the station's results, deemphasizing certain attributes when a user \"dislikes\" a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user \"likes\" a song. This is an example of a content-based approach.\n\nEach type of system has its strengths and weaknesses. In the above example, Last.fm requires a large amount of information about a user to make accurate recommendations. This is an example of the [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]] problem, and is common in collaborative filtering systems.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=ChenHung-Hsuan|last2=ChenPu|date=2019-01-09|title=Differentiating Regularization Weights -- A Simple Mechanism to Alleviate Cold Start in Recommender Systems|journal=ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD)|volume=13|pages=1\u201322|language=EN|doi=10.1145/3285954}}</ref><ref name=\"rubens2016\">{{cite book\n|last1=Rubens |first1=Neil\n|last2= [https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdielahi Elahi]|first2=Mehdi\n |last3=Sugiyama|first3=Masashi|last4=Kaplan|first4=Dain|editor1-last=Ricci\n |editor1-first=Francesco\n |editor2-last=Rokach|editor2-first=Lior\n |editor3-last=Shapira |editor3-first=Bracha\n |title=Recommender Systems Handbook\n |date=2016\n |publisher=Springer US\n |isbn=978-1-4899-7637-6\n |edition=2\n |chapter=Active Learning in Recommender Systems\n |chapter-url = https://rd.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6\n|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7637-6_24\n}}</ref><ref name=\"elahi2016\">\n{{cite journal|last1= [https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdielahi Elahi]|first1=Mehdi\n|last2= [http://www.inf.unibz.it/~ricci/ Ricci]|first2=Francesco\n|last3=Rubens|first3=Neil\n|title=A survey of active learning in collaborative filtering recommender systems|journal=Computer Science Review\n|volume=20\n|pages=29\u201350\n|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303781992|doi=10.1016/j.cosrev.2016.05.002\n|year=2016\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"schein02\">\n{{cite conference |author = Andrew I.

Breese |author2=David Heckerman |author3=Carl Kadie  |last-author-amp=yes |year = 1998 |title = Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering |conference =  In Proceedings of the Fourteenth conference on Uncertainty in artificial intelligence (UAI'98) |arxiv=1301.7363 }}\n</ref> Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past. The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items. By locating peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current user or item, they generate recommendations using this neighborhood.Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model-based. A well-known example of memory-based approaches is the user-based algorithm,<ref>{{cite report|author1=Breese, John S.|author2=Heckerman, David|author3=Kadie, Carl|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69656/tr-98-12.pdf|title=Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering|year=1998|publisher=Microsoft Research}}</ref> while that of model-based approaches is the [[Kernel-Mapping Recommender]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Kernel-Mapping Recommender system algorithms|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2012.04.012|volume=208|journal=Information Sciences|pages=81\u2013104|date=2012-11-15|last1=Ghazanfar|first1=Mustansar Ali|last2=Pr\u00fcgel-Bennett|first2=Adam|last3=Szedmak|first3=Sandor|citeseerx=10.1.1.701.7729}}</ref>\n\nA key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an \"understanding\" of the item itself. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems. For example, the [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|k-nearest neighbor]] (k-NN) approach<ref>{{cite web |last = Sarwar |first = B. |last2 = Karypis |first2 = G. |last3 = Konstan |first3 = J. |last4 = Riedl |first4 = J. |year = 2000 |url = http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/node/122 |title = Application of Dimensionality Reduction in Recommender System A Case Study }},</ref> and the [[Pearson correlation|Pearson Correlation]] as first implemented by Allen.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Allen | first = R.B. | date=1990 | title=User Models: Theory, Method, Practice| publisher = International J. Man-Machine Studies}}</ref>\n\nWhen building a model from a user's behavior, a distinction is often made between explicit and [[implicit data collection|implicit]] forms of [[data collection]].\n\nExamples of explicit data collection include the following:\n* Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.\n* Asking a user to search.\n* Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.\n* Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them.\n* Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes (see ''[[Rocchio algorithm|Rocchio classification]]'' or other similar techniques).\n\nExamples of [[implicit data collection]] include the following:\n* Observing the items that a user views in an online store.\n* Analyzing item/user viewing times.<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Parsons |first = J. |last2 = Ralph |first2 = P. |last3 = Gallagher |first3 = K. |date = July 2004 |title = Using viewing time to infer user preference in recommender systems |publisher = AAAI Workshop in Semantic Web Personalization, San Jose, California }}.</ref>\n* Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online.\n* Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer.\n* Analyzing the user's social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes.\n\nCollaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems: [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]], scalability, and sparsity.<ref name=\"Lee2007\">Sanghack Lee and Jihoon Yang and Sung-Yong Park, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u4qzlZAEjegC&pg=PA396&lpg=PA396&dq=sparsity+problem+content-based&source=bl&ots=ZEI50fmXTh&sig=jcwEba0LykRiLnYVbLYUwdrHYEo&hl=en&ei=-W7CTvboCIeHsgKf9NHDBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sparsity%20problem%20content-based&f=false Discovery of Hidden Similarity on Collaborative Filtering to Overcome Sparsity Problem], Discovery Science, 2007.</ref>\n* '''Cold start''': For a new user or item, there isn't enough data to make accurate recommendations.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"rubens2016\"/><ref name=\"elahi2016\"/>\n* '''Scalability''': In many of the environments in which these systems make recommendations, there are millions of users and products. Thus, a large amount of computation power is often necessary to calculate recommendations.\n* '''Sparsity''': The number of items sold on major e-commerce sites is extremely large. The most active users will only have rated a small subset of the overall database. Thus, even the most popular items have very few ratings.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y), an algorithm popularized by [[Amazon.com]]'s recommender system.<ref name=\"patft.uspto.gov\">[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=6,266,649.PN.&OS=PN/6,266,649&RS=PN/6,266,649 Collaborative Recommendations Using Item-to-Item Similarity Mappings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316185024/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=6%2C266%2C649.PN.&OS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649&RS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649 |date=2015-03-16 }}</ref>\n\nMany [[social networks]] originally used collaborative filtering to recommend new friends, groups, and other social connections by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends.<ref name=\"handbook\">Francesco Ricci and Lior Rokach and Bracha Shapira, [http://www.inf.unibz.it/~ricci/papers/intro-rec-sys-handbook.pdf Introduction to Recommender Systems Handbook], Recommender Systems Handbook, Springer, 2011, pp. 1-35</ref> Collaborative filtering is still used as part of hybrid systems.\n\n=== Content-based filtering ===\n\nAnother common approach when designing recommender systems is '''content-based filtering'''. Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences.<ref name=\"Aggarwal16Book\">{{cite book|last1=Aggarwal|first1=Charu C.|title=Recommender Systems: The Textbook|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319296579}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Brusilovsky|title=The Adaptive Web|year=2007|isbn=978-3-540-72078-2|page=325|author-link=Peter Brusilovsky}}</ref> These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on product features.\n\nIn this system, keywords are used to describe the items and a [[user profile]] is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past, or is examining in the present. It does not rely on a user sign-in mechanism to generate this often temporary profile. In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended. This approach has its roots in [[information retrieval]] and [[information filtering]] research.\n\nTo create a [[user profile]], the system mostly focuses on two types of information:\n\n1. A model of the user's preference.\n\n2. A history of the user's interaction with the recommender system.\n\nBasically, these methods use an item profile (i.e., a set of discrete attributes and features) characterizing the item within the system. To abstract the features of the items in the system, an item presentation algorithm is applied. A widely used algorithm is the [[tf\u2013idf]] representation (also called vector space representation).<ref>D.H. Wang, Y.C. Liang, D.Xu, X.Y. Feng, R.C. Guan(2018), \"[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705118302107 A content-based recommender system for computer science publications]\", ''[[Knowledge-Based Systems]]'', 157: 1-9</ref> The system creates a content-based profile of users based on a weighted vector of item features. The weights denote the importance of each feature to the user and can be computed from individually rated content vectors using a variety of techniques. Simple approaches use the average values of the rated item vector while other sophisticated methods use machine learning techniques such as [[Naive Bayes classifier|Bayesian Classifiers]], [[cluster analysis]], [[decision trees]], and [[artificial neural networks]] in order to estimate the probability that the user is going to like the item.<ref>{{cite news|title=Online Recommender Systems \u2013 How Does a Website Know What I Want?|url=http://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2015/05/25/online-recommender-systems-website-want/|last=Blanda, Stephanie|work=American Mathematical Society|date=May 25, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA key issue with content-based filtering is whether the system is able to learn user preferences from users' actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types. When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using, the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended. For example, recommending news articles based on browsing of news is useful, but would be much more useful when music, videos, products, discussions etc. from different services can be recommended based on news browsing. To overcome this, most content-based recommender systems now use some form of hybrid system.\n\nContent-based recommender systems can also include opinion-based recommender systems. In some cases, users are allowed to leave text review or feedback on the items. These user-generated texts are implicit data for the recommender system because they are potentially rich resource of both feature/aspects of the item, and users' evaluation/sentiment to the item. Features extracted from the user-generated reviews are improved [[Metadata|meta-data]] of items, because as they also reflect aspects of the item like [[Metadata|meta-data]], extracted features are widely concerned by the users. Sentiments extracted from the reviews can be seen as users' rating scores on the corresponding features. Popular approaches of opinion-based recommender system utilize various techniques including [[text mining]], [[information retrieval]], [[sentiment analysis]] (see also [[Multimodal sentiment analysis]]) and deep learning <ref>X.Y. Feng, H. Zhang, Y.J. Ren, P.H. Shang, Y. Zhu, Y.C. Liang, R.C. Guan, D. Xu, (2019), \"[https://www.jmir.org/2019/5/e12957/ The Deep Learning\u2013Based Recommender System \u201cPubmender\u201d for Choosing a Biomedical Publication Venue: Development and Validation Study]\", ''[[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]'', 21 (5): e12957</ref>.\n\n=== Multi-criteria recommender systems ===\nMulti-criteria recommender systems (MCRS) can be defined as recommender systems that incorporate preference information upon multiple criteria. Instead of developing recommendation techniques based on a single criterion value, the overall preference of user u for the item i, these systems try to predict a rating for unexplored items of u by exploiting preference information on multiple criteria that affect this overall preference value. Several researchers approach MCRS as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and apply MCDM methods and techniques to implement MCRS systems.<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Lakiotaki |first = K. |last2 = Matsatsinis |last3 = Tsoukias |first3 = A |title = Multicriteria User Modeling in Recommender Systems |journal = IEEE Intelligent Systems |volume = 26 |issue = 2 |pages = 64\u201376 |doi=10.1109/mis.2011.33|date = March 2011 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.476.6726 }}</ref> See this chapter<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |title=Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems |authors=Gediminas Adomavicius, Nikos Manouselis, YoungOk Kwon |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630021251/http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-30 }}</ref> for an extended introduction.\n\n=== Risk-aware recommender systems ===\nThe majority of existing approaches to recommender systems focus on recommending the most relevant content to users using contextual information, yet do not take into account the risk of disturbing the user with unwanted notifications. It is important to consider the risk of upsetting the user by pushing recommendations in certain circumstances, for instance, during a professional meeting, early morning, or late at night. Therefore, the performance of the recommender system depends in part on the degree to which it has incorporated the risk into the recommendation process. One option to manage this issue is ''DRARS'', a system which models the context-aware recommendation as a [[Multi-armed bandit|bandit problem]]. This system combines a content-based technique and a contextual bandit algorithm.<ref name=\"Bouneffouf2013\">{{citation | type=Ph.D.\n | last = Bouneffouf  | first = Djallel | title= DRARS, A Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System\n | publisher = Institut National des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications | year = 2013 | url = http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01026136/fr/}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile recommender systems ===\n{{see|Location based recommendation}}\nMobile recommender systems make use of internet-accessing [[smart phones]] to offer personalized, context-sensitive recommendations. This is a particularly difficult area of research as mobile data is more complex than data that recommender systems often have to deal with. It is heterogeneous, noisy, requires spatial and temporal auto-correlation, and has validation and generality problems.<ref name=\"taxirecommender\">{{cite conference |author1=Yong Ge |author2=Hui Xiong |author3=Alexander Tuzhilin |author4=Keli Xiao |author5=Marco Gruteser |author6=Michael J.

It uses this data to recommend a list of pickup points along a route, with the goal of optimizing occupancy times and profits.\n\nMobile recommendation systems have also been successfully built using the \"Web of Data\" as a source for structured information. A good example of such system is SMARTMUSEUM<ref name=\"Ruotsalo2013\">{{cite journal |author1=Tuukka Ruotsalo |author2=Krister Haav |author3=Antony Stoyanov |author4=Sylvain Roche |author5=Elena Fani |author6=Romina Deliai |author7=Eetu M\u00e4kel\u00e4 |author8=Tomi Kauppinen |author9=Eero Hyv\u00f6nen | title = SMARTMUSEUM: A Mobile Recommender System for the Web of Data | pages = 657\u2013662 | year = 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.websem.2013.03.001 | volume=20 | journal=Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web|citeseerx=10.1.1.676.7109 }}\n</ref> The system uses semantic modelling, information retrieval, and machine learning\ntechniques in order to recommend content matching user interests, even when presented with sparse or minimal user data.\n\n=== Hybrid recommender systems ===\n\nMost recommender systems now use a hybrid approach, combining [[collaborative filtering]], content-based filtering, and other approaches . There is no reason why several different techniques of the same type could not be hybridized. Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways: by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them; by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa); or by unifying the approaches into one model (see<ref name=\"Toward the Next Generation of Recommender Systems\" /> for a complete review of recommender systems). Several studies that empirically compare the performance of the hybrid with the pure collaborative and content-based methods and demonstrated that the hybrid methods can provide more accurate\nrecommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem, as well as the knowledge engineering bottleneck in [[Knowledge base|knowledge-based]] approaches.<ref>Rinke Hoekstra, [http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj32.pdf The Knowledge Reengineering Bottleneck], Semantic Web \u2013 Interoperability, Usability, Applicability 1 (2010) 1, IOS Press</ref>\n\n[[Netflix]] is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gomez-Uribe|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Hunt|first2=Neil|title=The Netflix Recommender System|journal=ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems|date=28 December 2015|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1\u201319|doi=10.1145/2843948}}</ref> The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).\n\nSome hybridization techniques include:\n*'''Weighted''': Combining the score of different recommendation components numerically.\n*'''Switching''': Choosing among recommendation components and applying the selected one.\n*'''Mixed''': Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation.\n*'''Feature Combination''': Features derived from different knowledge sources are combined together and given to a single recommendation algorithm.\n*'''Feature Augmentation''': Computing a feature or set of features, which is then part of the input to the next technique.\n*'''Cascade''': Recommenders are given strict priority, with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones.\n*'''Meta-level''': One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model, which is then the input used by the next technique.<ref name=hybrids>Robin Burke, [http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~acristea/courses/CS411/2010/Book%20-%20The%20Adaptive%20Web/HybridWebRecommenderSystems.pdf Hybrid Web Recommender Systems] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912085014/http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~acristea/courses/CS411/2010/Book%20-%20The%20Adaptive%20Web/HybridWebRecommenderSystems.pdf |date=2014-09-12 }}, pp. 377-408, The Adaptive Web, Peter Brusilovsky, Alfred Kobsa, Wolfgang Nejdl (Ed.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 4321, May 2007, 978-3-540-72078-2.</ref>\n\n== The Netflix Prize ==\n{{Main|Netflix Prize}}\n\nOne of the events that energized research in recommender systems was the [[Netflix Prize]]. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix sponsored a competition, offering a grand prize of $1,000,000 to the team that could take an offered dataset of over 100 million movie ratings and return recommendations that were 10% more accurate than those offered by the company's existing recommender system. This competition energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms.

To measure the [[effectiveness]] of recommender systems, and compare different approaches, three types of [[evaluation]]s are available: user studies, [[A/B testing|online evaluations (A/B tests)]], and offline evaluations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe commonly used metrics are the [[mean squared error]] and [[root mean squared error]], the latter having been used in the Netflix Prize. The information retrieval metrics such as [[precision and recall]] or [[Discounted Cumulative Gain|DCG]] are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method. Diversity, novelty, and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation.<ref>Lathia, N., Hailes, S., Capra, L., Amatriain, X.: [http://www.academia.edu/download/46585553/lathia_sigir10.pdf Temporal diversity in recommender systems]. In: Proceedings of the 33rd International ACMSIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2010, pp. 210\u2013217. ACM, New York</ref> However, many of the classic evaluation measures are highly criticized.<ref name=\"Turpin2001\">{{cite book| author=Turpin, Andrew H, Hersh, William| chapter=Why batch and user evaluations do not give the same results| title=Proceedings of the 24th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval| year=2001| pages=225\u2013231}}</ref>\n\nUser studies are rather small scale. A few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches, and then the users judge which recommendations are best. In A/B tests, recommendations are shown to typically thousands of users of a real product, and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations. The effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as [[conversion rate]] or [[click-through rate]]. Offline evaluations are based on historic data, e.g. a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/|title=MovieLens dataset|last=|first=|date=2013-09-06|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of recommendation approaches is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users' ratings in the dataset. While a rating is an explicit expression of whether a user liked a movie, such information is not available in all domains. For instance, in the domain of citation recommender systems, users typically do not rate a citation or recommended article. In such cases, offline evaluations may use implicit measures of effectiveness. For instance, it may be assumed that a recommender system is effective that is able to recommend as many articles as possible that are contained in a research article's reference list. However, this kind of offline evaluations is seen critical by many researchers.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=ChenHung-Hsuan|last2=ChungChu-An|last3=HuangHsin-Chien|last4=TsuiWen|date=2017-09-01|title=Common Pitfalls in Training and Evaluating Recommender Systems|journal=ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter|volume=19|pages=37\u201345|language=EN|doi=10.1145/3137597.3137601}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization|last=Jannach|first=Dietmar|last2=Lerche|first2=Lukas|last3=Gedikli|first3=Fatih|last4=Bonnin|first4=Geoffray|date=2013-06-10|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642388439|editor-last=Carberry|editor-first=Sandra|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=25\u201337|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38844-6_3|editor-last2=Weibelzahl|editor-first2=Stephan|editor-last3=Micarelli|editor-first3=Alessandro|editor-last4=Semeraro|editor-first4=Giovanni|citeseerx = 10.1.1.465.96}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Turpin|first=Andrew H.|last2=Hersh|first2=William|date=2001-01-01|title=Why Batch and User Evaluations Do Not Give the Same Results|journal=Proceedings of the 24th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval|series=SIGIR '01|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=[https://archive.org/details/proceedingsof24t0000inte/page/225 225\u2013231]|doi=10.1145/383952.383992|isbn=978-1581133318|citeseerx=10.1.1.165.5800|url=https://archive.org/details/proceedingsof24t0000inte/page/225}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> For instance, it has been shown that results of offline evaluations have low correlation with results from user studies or A/B tests.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries|volume = 9316|last1=Langer|first1=Stefan|date=2015-09-14|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319245911|editor-last=Kapidakis|editor-first=Sarantos|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=153\u2013168|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-24592-8_12|editor-last2=Mazurek|editor-first2=Cezary|editor-last3=Werla|editor-first3=Marcin|chapter = A Comparison of Offline Evaluations, Online Evaluations, and User Studies in the Context of Research-Paper Recommender Systems}}</ref> A dataset popular for offline evaluation has been shown to contain duplicate data and thus to lead to wrong conclusions in the evaluation of algorithms.<ref name=\"BasaranNtoutsi2017\">{{cite book|last1=Basaran|first1=Daniel|title=Proceedings of the 2017 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining|last2=Ntoutsi|first2=Eirini|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|year=2017|pages=390\u2013398|doi=10.1137/1.9781611974973.44|isbn=978-1-61197-497-3}}</ref> Often, results of so-called offline evaluations do not correlate with actually assessed user-satisfaction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beel|first=Joeran|last2=Genzmehr|first2=Marcel|last3=Langer|first3=Stefan|last4=N\u00fcrnberger|first4=Andreas|last5=Gipp|first5=Bela|date=2013-01-01|title=A Comparative Analysis of Offline and Online Evaluations and Discussion of Research Paper Recommender System Evaluation|journal=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Reproducibility and Replication in Recommender Systems Evaluation|series=RepSys '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=7\u201314|doi=10.1145/2532508.2532511|isbn=9781450324656|citeseerx=10.1.1.1031.973}}</ref> This is probably because offline training is highly biased toward the highly reachable items, and offline testing data is highly influenced by the outputs of the online recommendation module.<ref name=\":4\" /> Researchers have concluded that the results of offline evaluations should be viewed critically.\n\n=== Beyond accuracy ===\nTypically, research on recommender systems is concerned about finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms.

They are included as special features in the MCU films' [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[digital distribution]] releases, but are not included in the DVD releases. The films, which range from 4 to 15 minutes, are designed to be self-contained stories that provide more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. Two of the shorts have been the inspiration for [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|television series]] set in the MCU.\n\n''The Consultant'' (2011) and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' (2011) star [[Clark Gregg]] as Agent [[Phil Coulson]], and offer up self-contained stories about a day in the life of a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent. ''[[Item 47]]'' (2012) stars [[Lizzy Caplan]] and [[Jesse Bradford]] as a down-on-their-luck couple who find a discarded [[Chitauri]] gun after the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]''. ''[[Agent Carter (film)|Agent Carter]]'' (2013) stars [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter]] after the events of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', while ''[[All Hail the King]]'' (2014) stars [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Trevor Slattery]] after the events of ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.\n\n==Development==\nIn August 2011, Marvel announced that a couple of short films, designed to be self-contained stories,<ref name=\"Variety\" /> would be released [[direct-to-video]].<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said \"It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a way for us to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features.\" The first two films were made in conjunction with [[Mick Ebeling|The Ebeling Group]] and were directed by Leythum and written by [[Eric Pearson]].<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Winderbaum added that the name of the shorts program was derived from the label used by Marvel Comics for their [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot comics]].<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" /> \n\n[[Marvel Studios]] co-president Louis D'Esposito later stated that Marvel was considering the idea of introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, \"There's always a potential to introduce a character. We have 8,000 of them, and they can't all be at the same level. So maybe there are some that are not so popular, and we introduce them [with a short] \u2013 and they take off. I could see that happening.\"<ref name=\"Item47\" /> When asked whether a Marvel superhero would ever appear in a One-Shot, D'Esposito replied that \"We would love to, but it's difficult because there's a cost to that. If [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]] is flying around doing something, that [is] very costly. And first of all, what's the story? Is it important that that superhero is in the story?\"<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\" />\n\nDuring the ''[[Agent Carter (film)|Agent Carter]]'' panel at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], D'Esposito stated that bringing the shorts to theaters, to appear before features, was being considered.<ref name=\"Theaters\" /> In May 2014, it was revealed that a One-Shot would not be released with ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''{{'}}s home media,<ref name=\"CapTWS\" /> and in October 2014, it was revealed that ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''{{'}}s home media release would not include one either.<ref name=\"GotG\" /> ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' director [[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]] stated that a One-Shot was not included with the film due to lack of space on the disc.<ref name=\"GunnGotG\" />\n\n==Films==\n<onlyinclude>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

They see him as a war hero and blame the devastation in [[Harlem]] on [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]]. The Council orders them to send an agent to ask General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]] to release Blonsky into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. As [[Nick Fury]] does not want to release Blonsky, the two agents decide to send a [[Scapegoat|patsy]] to sabotage the meeting. At Sitwell's urging, Coulson reluctantly sends \"The Consultant\": [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]. As partially depicted in the post-credits scene of ''The Incredible Hulk'', a disgraced Ross sits drinking in a bar, when he is approached by Stark, who annoys Ross so much that he tries to have Stark removed from the bar. In reply, Stark buys the bar and has it scheduled for demolition. The next day, Coulson informs Sitwell that their plan worked, and that Blonsky will remain in prison.\n\nAt the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel announced that ''The Consultant'' would appear exclusively on the ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' [[Blu-ray]] release on September 13, 2011.

What better character to represent this idea than Agent Coulson, the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent we were introduced to in the [[Iron Man (2008 film)|first ''Iron Man'' film]]?\"<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Gregg said he was told about the short film program in the same phone call that warned him Coulson would die in ''The Avengers''. The actor noticed that the One-Shots could then provide more information on Coulson, to \"build the audience's relationship [with] him\" before his impactful death. ''The Consultant'' was written after ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'', due to the latter taking up 80% of the budget Marvel reserved for the two shorts, leaving a remaining budget \"[[Bottle episode|for two guys talking]]\". To help with this, Pearson included Sitwell in the short, who had a minor role in ''Thor'', and had him and Coulson \"brainstorming a way to deal with this [[red tape]] bureaucratic politics of the Avengers Initiative\".<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" />\n\n===''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' (2011){{anchor|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer}}===\nSet before the events of ''Thor'',<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Phil Coulson stops at a gas station on his way to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].

When the robbers ask whose car is outside, Coulson reveals himself, surrenders his keys, and offers to surrender his pistol as well. As he is about to turn over the gun, Coulson distracts the robbers and subdues both men in seconds. He then nonchalantly pays for his snacks while subtly advising the clerk not to mention his involvement to the police and leaves the station.\n\n''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' was included on the ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' Blu-ray release on October 25, 2011.<ref name=\"ThorHammerRelease\" /> It was directed by Leythum and written by Eric Pearson, with music by Paul Oakenfold.<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> ''A Funny Thing...'' was filmed over 2\u20133 days.<ref name=\"CBRBigger\" /> The short stars Clark Gregg reprising his role as Agent Phil Coulson,<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> and served to showcase Coulson as \"more than just an annoying bureaucrat\" of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" />\n\n===''Item 47'' (2012){{anchor|Item 47}}===\n{{Multiple image\n | image1 = Jesse Bradford by David Shankbone.jpg\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = \n | image2 = Lizzy Caplan at PaleyFest 2014.jpg\n | width2 = 110\n | alt2 = \n | footer = Newcomers to the MCU, [[Jesse Bradford]] (left) and [[Lizzy Caplan]] (right) starred in ''Item 47''.\n}}\n{{main|Item 47}}\nBennie and Claire, a down-on-their-luck couple, find a discarded [[Chitauri]] gun (\"Item 47\") left over from the attack on New York City in ''The Avengers''.

Agent Sitwell tracks the couple down to a motel room that gets wrecked in the subsequent confrontation, and the stolen money gets destroyed. Instead of killing the couple, Sitwell invites them to join S.H.I.E.L.D., with Bennie assigned to the [[Research and development|R&D]] 'think-tank' to reverse engineer the Chitauri technology, and Claire becoming Blake's assistant.\n\n''Item 47'' was released on ''The Avengers'' Blu-ray on September 25, 2012. The film stars [[Jesse Bradford]] and [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Bennie and Claire, respectively. The film also sees the return of Agent Sitwell, played by Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez, and introduced Agent Blake, portrayed by [[Titus Welliver]].<ref name=\"Item47\" /> It was directed by Marvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito, written by Eric Pearson,<ref name=\"Item47\" /> and features music by [[Christopher Lennertz]].<ref name=\"Lennertz\" /> The short film, which was filmed over four days,<ref name=\"CarterEW\" /> has a runtime of 12 minutes, longer than the previous films, which were no longer than 4 minutes.<ref name=\"Item47\" /> Pearson and D'Esposito had the idea for the short after watching ''The Avengers'' and thinking, \"New York is a mess.

She goes to the location, and is able to retrieve the serum single-handedly. The next day, her boss, Agent John Flynn, reprimands her for not going through the proper procedures to complete the mission. Carter explains that the mission was time-sensitive, but Flynn is unmoved, dismissing the indignant Carter as an \"old flame\" of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]]'s who was given her current job out of pity for her bereavement. The case line rings again, this time with [[Howard Stark]] on the other end, who tells Flynn to inform Carter that she will co-head the newly created S.H.I.E.L.D. In a mid-credit scene, [[Dum Dum Dugan]] is seen poolside with Stark, marveling at two women wearing the newly created [[bikini]]s.\n\n''Agent Carter'', released on the ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' Blu-ray release on September 24, 2013, as well as part of the digital download release on September 3, 2013,<ref name=\"MarvelCarter\" /> was seen as a good way of bridging that film with the then upcoming ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''. It had previously been considered to be released on other home media releases as well.<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\" /> It sees [[Hayley Atwell]] reprise her role as Peggy Carter,<ref name=\"MarvelCarter\" /> along with [[Dominic Cooper]], [[Neal McDonough]], and [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] reprising their roles as Howard Stark, Timothy \"Dum Dum\" Dugan, and Steve Rogers / Captain America, respectively, with Evans appearing via archive footage.

At the prison, he is living luxuriously, having his own personal \"butler\", Herman, as well as other inmates who act as his fan club and protection from other inmates. Looking on at the attention Slattery receives in the cafeteria is [[Justin Hammer]], who wonders what makes him so special. Slattery has been talking with a documentary filmmaker, [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Jackson Norriss]], to chronicle the events of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] situation seen in ''Iron Man 3''. Trying to learn more about him personally, Norriss recounts Slattery's past from his first casting as a child to his starring in a failed [[CBS]] pilot. Norriss eventually informs Slattery that his portrayal has angered some people, including the actual Ten Rings terrorist group, which Slattery did not know existed. Norriss tells him the history of the Mandarin and the terrorist group, before revealing that he is actually a member of the group. The real reason for Norriss interviewing Slattery is to break him out of prison so he can meet the actual Mandarin. Hearing this, Slattery still has no idea of the full ramifications of his posing as the Mandarin.\n\nIn October 2013, [[Ben Kingsley]] said he was working on a secret project with Marvel involving \"many members of the crew that were involved in ''Iron Man 3'',\"<ref name=\"KingsleySecret\" /> later revealed to be the short ''All Hail the King'',<ref name=\"Kingsley\" /> which was released on the digital download release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' on February 4, 2014, and on February 25, 2014 for the Blu-ray release.<ref name=\"AHTK\" /> The film stars: Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery, reprising his role from ''Iron Man 3''; [[Scoot McNairy]] as Jackson Norriss, a member of the Ten Rings terrorist organization posing as a documentary filmmaker;<ref name=\"Kingsley\" /><ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> [[Lester Speight]] as Herman;<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> and [[Sam Rockwell]] as Justin Hammer, reprising his role from ''Iron Man 2''.<ref name=\"Rockwell\" /> The short is written and directed by [[Drew Pearce]], the co-screenwriter of ''Iron Man 3'',<ref name=\"Kingsley\" /> and was filmed in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"PearceEmpire\" /> Pearce and producer Stephen Broussard had the idea for the short during the production of ''Iron Man 3'', to provide \"a fresh take\" on the Mandarin character.<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" /> Music for the short was composed by [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]], with the ''Caged Heat'' scenes composed by 1980s TV-music icon [[Mike Post]].<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe film actors|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series actors}}\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:95%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">'''List indicator(s)'''\n*A dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film<!--, or that the character's presence in the film has not yet been announced-->.\n*A {{note|television|T}} indicates the character reappears in a [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series actors|television series]].\n*A {{note label|voice|V|}} indicates a voice-only role\n*An {{note label|archive|A|}} indicates the actor or actress appears via archived footage from previous films.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=99%\n!

The One-Shots feature audio commentary, with Gregg providing it for ''The Consultant'' and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer''; D'Esposito, Hernandez, Welliver, and Bradford on ''Item 47''; D'Esposito and Atwell for ''Agent Carter''; and Pearce and Kingsley with ''All Hail the King''. The collection was released on December 8, 2015.<ref name=\"PhaseTwoBoxset\" />\n\n==Reception==\nCindy White of [[IGN]] called ''The Consultant'' \"intriguing\" and said, \"The snappy dialogue seems to fit right in with what we expect from a Joss Whedon-ized Avengers movie.\"<ref name=\"IGNConsultant\" /> Scott Chitwood of ComingSoon.net said, \"Considering a third of this is a rehash of an old bonus scene and the other 2/3 is Coulson sitting and having a chat, this is a pretty big disappointment.\"<ref name=\"ComingSoonConsultant\" />\n\nR.L. Shaffer of IGN called ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' \"fun\".<ref name=\"IGNHammer\" /> Zachary Scheer of Cinema Blend said, \"The short is as hackneyed as that title. It's about four minutes of Coulson being a badass, if the definition of 'badass' is performing needless slow-motion action stunts and then pausing to consider something normal people would consider \u2013 like which donuts to buy.\"<ref name=\"CinemaBlendHammer\" />\n\nAndre Dellamorte of Collider called ''Item 47'' \"silly\".<ref name=\"ColliderItem47\" /> William Bibbiani of [[Crave Online]] said, \"The short is largely a success: [Maximiliano] Hernandez, [Jesse] Bradford and [Lizzy] Caplan are all in fine form although, [Titus] Welliver seems saddled with a little awkward dialogue, particularly in regards to Coulson, which doesn't entirely sell.\"<ref name=\"CraveOnlineItem47\" /> Spencer Terry of Superhero Hype! said, \"[''Item 47''] is easily the best one they've done, and I think that can be attributed to its length seeing as it's three times longer than the other One-Shots. With a longer run time, the short film doesn't have to rush to show us everything that it wants to \u2013 we get a clear understanding of both the S.H.I.E.L.D. perspective of the events and the robbers' point of view.\"<ref name=\"SHHItem47\" />\n\nAndy Hunsaker of Crave Online said, \"''Agent Carter'' is a fun treat which could lead the way for some female-led Marvel films and, if nothing else, it gives its title character the send-off she deserves.\"<ref name=\"CraveOnlineAgentCarter\" /> Scott Collura of IGN said, \"Atwell's Carter is the big-screen female superhero we've all been waiting for. She kicks so much ass in this short story with such aplomb, using not just brawn but also brains, and it's all very clever and fun.\"<ref name=\"IGNAgentCarter\" /> Rosie Fletcher of ''[[Total Film]]'' said, \"Atwell makes a perfect femme fatale-come-special agent, and this '40s noir-style short looks great and packs some euphoric action moments.\"<ref name=\"TotalFilm\" />\n\nIGN's Cliff Wheatley gave ''All Hail the King'' a 9.4 out of 10. He said that it's \"a return to the loveable personality of the hapless Trevor and a step forward for the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has its twists that should satisfy both lovers and haters of Trevor Slattery. But it's the approach that Pearce takes with the material, from the kung-fu movie style credit sequences to the light-hearted tone that takes a sudden and jarring turn. Kingsley once again shines in the role of Slattery, aloof and ignorant, but more than happy to slide back into Mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans. Pearce does go for some of the same jokes from ''Iron Man 3'' in a sort of referential way, but it's nothing too damaging.\"<ref name=\"IGNAHTK\" /> Andrew Wheeler of [[Comics Alliance]] criticized the way homosexuality was presented in the short, given it was Marvel Studios' first attempt to bring [[LGBT]] concepts into the MCU.<ref name=\"Rockwell\" />\n\n==Potential projects==\nIn May 2013, [[DMG Entertainment]] stated they were considering creating a short film, tentatively titled ''The Prologue'', centered on [[Wang Xueqi]]'s character, Dr. Wu, from ''Iron Man 3'', who only appeared in 10 seconds of the film outside of China; Xueqi appeared in three minutes of the Chinese release of the film. ''The Prologue'' would be composed of sequences shot during the production of ''Iron Man 3'' and would elaborate on Wu with the short set before the events of ''Iron Man''. DMG added they were unsure of how they would release the short, saying rumors claiming ''The Prologue'' could possibly release on television or a future MCU home media release were \"speculations\".<ref name=\"Prologue\" />\n\nIn July 2013, D'Esposito said he had considered making stand-alone shorts for several characters, including [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], a young Nick Fury, [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. Regarding Loki, D'Esposito said \"Being on Asgard is very difficult for us to do in a short. It's just impossible for us cost wise. The short would be 30 seconds, and it's over. One shot of Loki on Asgard.\" On Fury and Black Panther, he remarked \"It's very complicated to do: who plays those characters? And designing the costume, getting it going \u2026 We tried. We were there in development, and we tried, but they were very difficult for all the reasons I gave. And we don\u2019t want to do something that\u2019s half baked because it\u2019s not good for us and it\u2019s not good for our fans.\"<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\" /> In February 2014, Pearce mentioned other shorts that he had written that never came to fruition, including ones based on [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], [[Jessica Jones]], and [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]].<ref name=\"PearceTotalFilm\" />\n\nIn May 2015, Marvel Studios head [[Kevin Feige]] stated that there were \"no active plans for the One-Shots to return\", but added that the studio was not opposed to continuing the series,<ref name=\"FeigeMay2015\" /> and there was already \"a backlog of ideas\" for potential One-Shots.<ref name=\"FeigeJuly2015\" /> In September 2015, Feige provided further comments on the return of the One-Shots, saying, \"The universe is big, and we're moving up to three [feature films] a year this year. I don't know how much beyond that we can go...[So] we do talk about [making more One-Shots] a lot...It's just about finding the time and the place.\"<ref name=\"FeigeSep2015\" /> In June 2017, [[Spider-Man]] actor [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] hinted that Marvel was planning on creating more One-Shots.<ref name=\"Holland2017\" /> That October, Pearson further hinted that Marvel was interested in creating more, adding he had \"a whole folder full of other One-Shots\" he had created.<ref name=\"PearsonOct2017\" /> [[Taika Waititi]], director of ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', also stated there had been discussions to resurrect the One-Shots, creating one centered on the characters [[Korg (comics)|Korg]] and [[Miek]] from ''Ragnarok''. Feige also noted that the One-Shot films could potentially \"morph into extra content that's created prior to a film's release instead of for its home entertainment release\", noting the successful ''[[Team Thor (series)|Team Thor]]'' mockumentary shorts directed by Waititi, which \"were great fun, and are quite doable, and in some parts helped redefine Thor into what he's become in ''Ragnarok'' in a fun way. So there might be opportunities for more things like that.\"<ref name=\"FandangoOct2017\" /> In April 2018, D'Esposito noted that Disney hoped Marvel would continue with the One-Shot films, but admitted that the studio was \"just so busy\" focusing on their increased feature film output.<ref name=\"TooBusy2018\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/news/how-marvel-is-turning-to-short-films-to-sell-more-dvds-blu-rays-1200566759/ |title=How Marvel is Turning to Short Films to Sell More DVDs, Blu-rays |last=Graser |first=Marc |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=July 23, 2013 |accessdate=April 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OwWmllFZ?url=http://variety.com/2013/biz/news/how-marvel-is-turning-to-short-films-to-sell-more-dvds-blu-rays-1200566759/ |archivedate=April 19, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\">{{cite av media|title=Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe|date=2014|location=''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Complete First Season'' Home media, bonus material|publisher=ABC Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Development -->\n\n<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\">{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/07/17/marvel-one-shots-agent-carter-ms-marvel-loki-young-nick-fury-black-panther/ |title=Marvel One-Shots: Might 'Agent Carter' clear way for Ms. Marvel, Loki, young Nick Fury, or Black Panther?

They are included as special features in the MCU films' [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[digital distribution]] releases, but are not included in the DVD releases. The films, which range from 4 to 15 minutes, are designed to be self-contained stories that provide more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. Two of the shorts have been the inspiration for [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|television series]] set in the MCU.\n\n''The Consultant'' (2011) and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' (2011) star [[Clark Gregg]] as Agent [[Phil Coulson]], and offer up self-contained stories about a day in the life of a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent. ''[[Item 47]]'' (2012) stars [[Lizzy Caplan]] and [[Jesse Bradford]] as a down-on-their-luck couple who find a discarded [[Chitauri]] gun after the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]''. ''[[Agent Carter (film)|Agent Carter]]'' (2013) stars [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter]] after the events of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', while ''[[All Hail the King]]'' (2014) stars [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Trevor Slattery]] after the events of ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.\n\n==Development==\nIn August 2011, Marvel announced that a couple of short films, designed to be self-contained stories,<ref name=\"Variety\" /> would be released [[direct-to-video]].<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said \"It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a way for us to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features.\" The first two films were made in conjunction with [[Mick Ebeling|The Ebeling Group]] and were directed by Leythum and written by [[Eric Pearson]].<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Winderbaum added that the name of the shorts program was derived from the label used by Marvel Comics for their [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot comics]].<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" /> \n\n[[Marvel Studios]] co-president Louis D'Esposito later stated that Marvel was considering the idea of introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, \"There's always a potential to introduce a character. We have 8,000 of them, and they can't all be at the same level. So maybe there are some that are not so popular, and we introduce them [with a short] \u2013 and they take off. I could see that happening.\"<ref name=\"Item47\" /> When asked whether a Marvel superhero would ever appear in a One-Shot, D'Esposito replied that \"We would love to, but it's difficult because there's a cost to that. If [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]] is flying around doing something, that [is] very costly. And first of all, what's the story? Is it important that that superhero is in the story?\"<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\" />\n\nDuring the ''[[Agent Carter (film)|Agent Carter]]'' panel at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], D'Esposito stated that bringing the shorts to theaters, to appear before features, was being considered.<ref name=\"Theaters\" /> In May 2014, it was revealed that a One-Shot would not be released with ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''{{'}}s home media,<ref name=\"CapTWS\" /> and in October 2014, it was revealed that ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''{{'}}s home media release would not include one either.<ref name=\"GotG\" /> ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' director [[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]] stated that a One-Shot was not included with the film due to lack of space on the disc.<ref name=\"GunnGotG\" />\n\n==Films==\n<onlyinclude>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n!

They see him as a war hero and blame the devastation in [[Harlem]] on [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]]. The Council orders them to send an agent to ask General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross]] to release Blonsky into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. As [[Nick Fury]] does not want to release Blonsky, the two agents decide to send a [[Scapegoat|patsy]] to sabotage the meeting. At Sitwell's urging, Coulson reluctantly sends \"The Consultant\": [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]. As partially depicted in the post-credits scene of ''The Incredible Hulk'', a disgraced Ross sits drinking in a bar, when he is approached by Stark, who annoys Ross so much that he tries to have Stark removed from the bar. In reply, Stark buys the bar and has it scheduled for demolition. The next day, Coulson informs Sitwell that their plan worked, and that Blonsky will remain in prison.\n\nAt the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Marvel announced that ''The Consultant'' would appear exclusively on the ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' [[Blu-ray]] release on September 13, 2011.

What better character to represent this idea than Agent Coulson, the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent we were introduced to in the [[Iron Man (2008 film)|first ''Iron Man'' film]]?\"<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Gregg said he was told about the short film program in the same phone call that warned him Coulson would die in ''The Avengers''. The actor noticed that the One-Shots could then provide more information on Coulson, to \"build the audience's relationship [with] him\" before his impactful death. ''The Consultant'' was written after ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'', due to the latter taking up 80% of the budget Marvel reserved for the two shorts, leaving a remaining budget \"[[Bottle episode|for two guys talking]]\". To help with this, Pearson included Sitwell in the short, who had a minor role in ''Thor'', and had him and Coulson \"brainstorming a way to deal with this [[red tape]] bureaucratic politics of the Avengers Initiative\".<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" />\n\n===''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' (2011){{anchor|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer}}===\nSet before the events of ''Thor'',<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> Phil Coulson stops at a gas station on his way to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].

When the robbers ask whose car is outside, Coulson reveals himself, surrenders his keys, and offers to surrender his pistol as well. As he is about to turn over the gun, Coulson distracts the robbers and subdues both men in seconds. He then nonchalantly pays for his snacks while subtly advising the clerk not to mention his involvement to the police and leaves the station.\n\n''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' was included on the ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' Blu-ray release on October 25, 2011.<ref name=\"ThorHammerRelease\" /> It was directed by Leythum and written by Eric Pearson, with music by Paul Oakenfold.<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> ''A Funny Thing...'' was filmed over 2\u20133 days.<ref name=\"CBRBigger\" /> The short stars Clark Gregg reprising his role as Agent Phil Coulson,<ref name=\"ShortsAnnouncement\" /> and served to showcase Coulson as \"more than just an annoying bureaucrat\" of S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" />\n\n===''Item 47'' (2012){{anchor|Item 47}}===\n{{Multiple image\n | image1 = Jesse Bradford by David Shankbone.jpg\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = \n | image2 = Lizzy Caplan at PaleyFest 2014.jpg\n | width2 = 110\n | alt2 = \n | footer = Newcomers to the MCU, [[Jesse Bradford]] (left) and [[Lizzy Caplan]] (right) starred in ''Item 47''.\n}}\n{{main|Item 47}}\nBennie and Claire, a down-on-their-luck couple, find a discarded [[Chitauri]] gun (\"Item 47\") left over from the attack on New York City in ''The Avengers''.

Instead of killing the couple, Sitwell invites them to join S.H.I.E.L.D., with Bennie assigned to the [[Research and development|R&D]] 'think-tank' to reverse engineer the Chitauri technology, and Claire becoming Blake's assistant.\n\n''Item 47'' was released on ''The Avengers'' Blu-ray on September 25, 2012. The film stars [[Jesse Bradford]] and [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Bennie and Claire, respectively.

She goes to the location, and is able to retrieve the serum single-handedly. The next day, her boss, Agent John Flynn, reprimands her for not going through the proper procedures to complete the mission. Carter explains that the mission was time-sensitive, but Flynn is unmoved, dismissing the indignant Carter as an \"old flame\" of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]]'s who was given her current job out of pity for her bereavement. The case line rings again, this time with [[Howard Stark]] on the other end, who tells Flynn to inform Carter that she will co-head the newly created S.H.I.E.L.D. In a mid-credit scene, [[Dum Dum Dugan]] is seen poolside with Stark, marveling at two women wearing the newly created [[bikini]]s.\n\n''Agent Carter'', released on the ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' Blu-ray release on September 24, 2013, as well as part of the digital download release on September 3, 2013,<ref name=\"MarvelCarter\" /> was seen as a good way of bridging that film with the then upcoming ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''.

Looking on at the attention Slattery receives in the cafeteria is [[Justin Hammer]], who wonders what makes him so special. Slattery has been talking with a documentary filmmaker, [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Jackson Norriss]], to chronicle the events of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] situation seen in ''Iron Man 3''. Trying to learn more about him personally, Norriss recounts Slattery's past from his first casting as a child to his starring in a failed [[CBS]] pilot. Norriss eventually informs Slattery that his portrayal has angered some people, including the actual Ten Rings terrorist group, which Slattery did not know existed. Norriss tells him the history of the Mandarin and the terrorist group, before revealing that he is actually a member of the group. The real reason for Norriss interviewing Slattery is to break him out of prison so he can meet the actual Mandarin. Hearing this, Slattery still has no idea of the full ramifications of his posing as the Mandarin.\n\nIn October 2013, [[Ben Kingsley]] said he was working on a secret project with Marvel involving \"many members of the crew that were involved in ''Iron Man 3'',\"<ref name=\"KingsleySecret\" /> later revealed to be the short ''All Hail the King'',<ref name=\"Kingsley\" /> which was released on the digital download release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' on February 4, 2014, and on February 25, 2014 for the Blu-ray release.<ref name=\"AHTK\" /> The film stars: Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery, reprising his role from ''Iron Man 3''; [[Scoot McNairy]] as Jackson Norriss, a member of the Ten Rings terrorist organization posing as a documentary filmmaker;<ref name=\"Kingsley\" /><ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> [[Lester Speight]] as Herman;<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> and [[Sam Rockwell]] as Justin Hammer, reprising his role from ''Iron Man 2''.<ref name=\"Rockwell\" /> The short is written and directed by [[Drew Pearce]], the co-screenwriter of ''Iron Man 3'',<ref name=\"Kingsley\" /> and was filmed in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"PearceEmpire\" /> Pearce and producer Stephen Broussard had the idea for the short during the production of ''Iron Man 3'', to provide \"a fresh take\" on the Mandarin character.<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" /> Music for the short was composed by [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]], with the ''Caged Heat'' scenes composed by 1980s TV-music icon [[Mike Post]].<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe film actors|List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series actors}}\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:justify; width:95%; float:center; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px; display:table;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">'''List indicator(s)'''\n*A dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film<!--, or that the character's presence in the film has not yet been announced-->.\n*A {{note|television|T}} indicates the character reappears in a [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series actors|television series]].\n*A {{note label|voice|V|}} indicates a voice-only role\n*An {{note label|archive|A|}} indicates the actor or actress appears via archived footage from previous films.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=99%\n!

The One-Shots feature audio commentary, with Gregg providing it for ''The Consultant'' and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer''; D'Esposito, Hernandez, Welliver, and Bradford on ''Item 47''; D'Esposito and Atwell for ''Agent Carter''; and Pearce and Kingsley with ''All Hail the King''. The collection was released on December 8, 2015.<ref name=\"PhaseTwoBoxset\" />\n\n==Reception==\nCindy White of [[IGN]] called ''The Consultant'' \"intriguing\" and said, \"The snappy dialogue seems to fit right in with what we expect from a Joss Whedon-ized Avengers movie.\"<ref name=\"IGNConsultant\" /> Scott Chitwood of ComingSoon.net said, \"Considering a third of this is a rehash of an old bonus scene and the other 2/3 is Coulson sitting and having a chat, this is a pretty big disappointment.\"<ref name=\"ComingSoonConsultant\" />\n\nR.L. Shaffer of IGN called ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'' \"fun\".<ref name=\"IGNHammer\" /> Zachary Scheer of Cinema Blend said, \"The short is as hackneyed as that title. It's about four minutes of Coulson being a badass, if the definition of 'badass' is performing needless slow-motion action stunts and then pausing to consider something normal people would consider \u2013 like which donuts to buy.\"<ref name=\"CinemaBlendHammer\" />\n\nAndre Dellamorte of Collider called ''Item 47'' \"silly\".<ref name=\"ColliderItem47\" /> William Bibbiani of [[Crave Online]] said, \"The short is largely a success: [Maximiliano] Hernandez, [Jesse] Bradford and [Lizzy] Caplan are all in fine form although, [Titus] Welliver seems saddled with a little awkward dialogue, particularly in regards to Coulson, which doesn't entirely sell.\"<ref name=\"CraveOnlineItem47\" /> Spencer Terry of Superhero Hype! said, \"[''Item 47''] is easily the best one they've done, and I think that can be attributed to its length seeing as it's three times longer than the other One-Shots. With a longer run time, the short film doesn't have to rush to show us everything that it wants to \u2013 we get a clear understanding of both the S.H.I.E.L.D. perspective of the events and the robbers' point of view.\"<ref name=\"SHHItem47\" />\n\nAndy Hunsaker of Crave Online said, \"''Agent Carter'' is a fun treat which could lead the way for some female-led Marvel films and, if nothing else, it gives its title character the send-off she deserves.\"<ref name=\"CraveOnlineAgentCarter\" /> Scott Collura of IGN said, \"Atwell's Carter is the big-screen female superhero we've all been waiting for. She kicks so much ass in this short story with such aplomb, using not just brawn but also brains, and it's all very clever and fun.\"<ref name=\"IGNAgentCarter\" /> Rosie Fletcher of ''[[Total Film]]'' said, \"Atwell makes a perfect femme fatale-come-special agent, and this '40s noir-style short looks great and packs some euphoric action moments.\"<ref name=\"TotalFilm\" />\n\nIGN's Cliff Wheatley gave ''All Hail the King'' a 9.4 out of 10. He said that it's \"a return to the loveable personality of the hapless Trevor and a step forward for the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has its twists that should satisfy both lovers and haters of Trevor Slattery. But it's the approach that Pearce takes with the material, from the kung-fu movie style credit sequences to the light-hearted tone that takes a sudden and jarring turn. Kingsley once again shines in the role of Slattery, aloof and ignorant, but more than happy to slide back into Mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans. Pearce does go for some of the same jokes from ''Iron Man 3'' in a sort of referential way, but it's nothing too damaging.\"<ref name=\"IGNAHTK\" /> Andrew Wheeler of [[Comics Alliance]] criticized the way homosexuality was presented in the short, given it was Marvel Studios' first attempt to bring [[LGBT]] concepts into the MCU.<ref name=\"Rockwell\" />\n\n==Potential projects==\nIn May 2013, [[DMG Entertainment]] stated they were considering creating a short film, tentatively titled ''The Prologue'', centered on [[Wang Xueqi]]'s character, Dr. Wu, from ''Iron Man 3'', who only appeared in 10 seconds of the film outside of China; Xueqi appeared in three minutes of the Chinese release of the film. ''The Prologue'' would be composed of sequences shot during the production of ''Iron Man 3'' and would elaborate on Wu with the short set before the events of ''Iron Man''. DMG added they were unsure of how they would release the short, saying rumors claiming ''The Prologue'' could possibly release on television or a future MCU home media release were \"speculations\".<ref name=\"Prologue\" />\n\nIn July 2013, D'Esposito said he had considered making stand-alone shorts for several characters, including [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], a young Nick Fury, [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. Regarding Loki, D'Esposito said \"Being on Asgard is very difficult for us to do in a short. It's just impossible for us cost wise. The short would be 30 seconds, and it's over. One shot of Loki on Asgard.\" On Fury and Black Panther, he remarked \"It's very complicated to do: who plays those characters? And designing the costume, getting it going \u2026 We tried. We were there in development, and we tried, but they were very difficult for all the reasons I gave. And we don\u2019t want to do something that\u2019s half baked because it\u2019s not good for us and it\u2019s not good for our fans.\"<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\" /> In February 2014, Pearce mentioned other shorts that he had written that never came to fruition, including ones based on [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], [[Jessica Jones]], and [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]].<ref name=\"PearceTotalFilm\" />\n\nIn May 2015, Marvel Studios head [[Kevin Feige]] stated that there were \"no active plans for the One-Shots to return\", but added that the studio was not opposed to continuing the series,<ref name=\"FeigeMay2015\" /> and there was already \"a backlog of ideas\" for potential One-Shots.<ref name=\"FeigeJuly2015\" /> In September 2015, Feige provided further comments on the return of the One-Shots, saying, \"The universe is big, and we're moving up to three [feature films] a year this year. I don't know how much beyond that we can go...[So] we do talk about [making more One-Shots] a lot...It's just about finding the time and the place.\"<ref name=\"FeigeSep2015\" /> In June 2017, [[Spider-Man]] actor [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] hinted that Marvel was planning on creating more One-Shots.<ref name=\"Holland2017\" /> That October, Pearson further hinted that Marvel was interested in creating more, adding he had \"a whole folder full of other One-Shots\" he had created.<ref name=\"PearsonOct2017\" /> [[Taika Waititi]], director of ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', also stated there had been discussions to resurrect the One-Shots, creating one centered on the characters [[Korg (comics)|Korg]] and [[Miek]] from ''Ragnarok''. Feige also noted that the One-Shot films could potentially \"morph into extra content that's created prior to a film's release instead of for its home entertainment release\", noting the successful ''[[Team Thor (series)|Team Thor]]'' mockumentary shorts directed by Waititi, which \"were great fun, and are quite doable, and in some parts helped redefine Thor into what he's become in ''Ragnarok'' in a fun way. So there might be opportunities for more things like that.\"<ref name=\"FandangoOct2017\" /> In April 2018, D'Esposito noted that Disney hoped Marvel would continue with the One-Shot films, but admitted that the studio was \"just so busy\" focusing on their increased feature film output.<ref name=\"TooBusy2018\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Variety\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/news/how-marvel-is-turning-to-short-films-to-sell-more-dvds-blu-rays-1200566759/ |title=How Marvel is Turning to Short Films to Sell More DVDs, Blu-rays |last=Graser |first=Marc |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=July 23, 2013 |accessdate=April 19, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OwWmllFZ?url=http://variety.com/2013/biz/news/how-marvel-is-turning-to-short-films-to-sell-more-dvds-blu-rays-1200566759/ |archivedate=April 19, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\">{{cite av media|title=Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe|date=2014|location=''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Complete First Season'' Home media, bonus material|publisher=ABC Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Development -->\n\n<ref name=\"PotentialShortsJuly2013\">{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/07/17/marvel-one-shots-agent-carter-ms-marvel-loki-young-nick-fury-black-panther/ |title=Marvel One-Shots: Might 'Agent Carter' clear way for Ms. Marvel, Loki, young Nick Fury, or Black Panther?
