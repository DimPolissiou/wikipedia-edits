His donation of land for a railroad station site established the town as the center of the San Joaquin Valley's {{which|date=February 2013}} booming wheat industry. Railroad officials commemorated his donation by naming the fledgling city in his honor.\nWhen mining fever began to fade, wheat demand slackened. Water from the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]] was diverted for crop irrigation, and the region began its over 100-year agricultural tradition.\n\nWith water and railroad services in place, farming families of European immigrants were recruited, and the settlement was incorporated in 1913, with Ordinance No. 1 adopting and prescribing the style of a Common Seal on February 25, 1913. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reedley.com/history/|website=www.reedley.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> That same year, cement sidewalks, a sewer system, a fire department, and the first of two steel water towers were constructed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reedley.com/history/historical_dates|title=Historical Dates|website=www.reedley.com|access-date=2016-09-27}}</ref>\n\nA colony of German [[Mennonites]] played an important role in the town's early history.

His donation of land for a railroad station site established the town as the center of the San Joaquin Valley's {{which|date=February 2013}} booming wheat industry. Railroad officials commemorated his donation by naming the fledgling city in his honor.\nWhen mining fever began to fade, wheat demand slackened. Water from the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]] was diverted for crop irrigation, and the region began its over 100-year agricultural tradition.\n\nWith water and railroad services in place, farming families of European immigrants were recruited, and the settlement was incorporated in 1913, with Ordinance No. 1 adopting and prescribing the style of a Common Seal on February 25, 1913. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reedley.com/history/|website=www.reedley.com|access-date=2020-3-31}}</ref> That same year, cement sidewalks, a sewer system, a fire department, and the first of two steel water towers were constructed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reedley.com/history/historical_dates|title=Historical Dates|website=www.reedley.com|access-date=2016-09-27}}</ref>\n\nA colony of German [[Mennonites]] played an important role in the town's early history.

It forms part of a [[World Heritage Site]]. It is the [[cathedral]] of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], currently [[Justin Welby]], leader of the [[Church of England]] and symbolic leader of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]].  Its formal title is the '''Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Christ at Canterbury'''.\n\nFounded in 597, the cathedral was completely rebuilt between 1070 and 1077. The east end was greatly enlarged at the beginning of the 12th century, and largely rebuilt in the Gothic style following a fire in 1174, with significant eastward extensions to accommodate the flow of pilgrims visiting the shrine of [[Thomas Becket]], the archbishop who was murdered in the cathedral in 1170. The Norman nave and transepts survived until the late 14th century, when they were demolished to make way for the present structures.\n\nBefore the [[English Reformation]] the cathedral was part of a [[Benedictine]] monastic community known as '''Christ Church, Canterbury''', as well as being the seat of the archbishop.\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman===\nChristianity had started to become powerful in the [[Roman Empire]] around the 3rd century. Following the conversion of [[Augustine of Hippo]] in the 4th century, the influence of Christianity grew steadily.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The cathedral's first bishop was [[Augustine of Canterbury]], previously [[abbot]] of [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio|St Andrew's Benedictine Abbey]] in Rome; when other dioceses were founded in England he was made archbishop. He was sent by [[Pope Gregory I]] in 596 as a missionary to the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxons]]. Augustine founded the cathedral in 597 and dedicated it to [[Jesus Christ]], the [[Holy Saviour]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Canterbury Cathedral- A Virtual Tour |accessdate=7 October 2008 |url=http://www.faculty.de.gcsu.edu/~dvess/ids/medieval/canterbury/canterbury.shtml |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228204322/http://www.faculty.de.gcsu.edu/~dvess/ids/medieval/canterbury/canterbury.shtml |archivedate=28 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nAugustine also founded the [[St Augustine's Abbey|Abbey of St Peter and Paul]] outside the [[Defensive wall|city walls]].

The king had frequent conflicts with the  strong-willed Becket and is said to have exclaimed in frustration, \"[[Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?]]\" Four knights took it literally and murdered Becket in his own cathedral. After the Anglo-Saxon [[\u00c6lfheah of Canterbury|\u00c6lfheah]], Becket was the second Archbishop of Canterbury to be murdered.\n\nThe posthumous veneration of Becket made the cathedral a place of pilgrimage. This brought both the need to expand the cathedral and the wealth that made it possible.\n\n====Rebuilding of the choir====\n[[File:TOMB OF THE BLACK PRINCE, CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL.jpg|thumb|Tomb of the [[Black Prince]]]]\nIn September 1174 the choir was severely damaged by fire, necessitating a major reconstruction,{{sfn|Cook|1949|p=23}}  the progress of which was recorded in detail by a monk named [[Gervase of Canterbury|Gervase]].{{sfn|Willis|1845|p=xiv}} The crypt survived the fire intact,{{sfn|Willis|1845| p=71}} and it was found possible to retain the outer walls of the choir, which were increased in height by {{convert|12|ft|m}} in the course of the rebuilding, but with the round-headed form of their windows left unchanged.{{sfn|Willis|1845|p=79}} Everything else was replaced in the new Gothic style, with  pointed arches, rib vaulting and flying buttresses. The limestone used was imported from Caen in Normandy, and [[Purbeck marble]] was used for the shafting. The choir was back in use by 1180 and in that year the remains of Dunstan and \u00c6lfheah were moved there from the crypt.{{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nThe master-mason appointed to rebuild the choir was a Frenchman, [[William of Sens]]. Following his injury in a fall from the scaffolding in 1179 he was replaced by one of his former assistants, known as \"[[William the Englishman]]\".{{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=22\u201323}}\n\n====Trinity Chapel and Shrine of Thomas Becket====\n[[File:Canterbury Cathedral Trinity Chapel Stained Glass, Kent, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Stained glass in the Trinity Chapel]]\n[[File:Canterbury Cathedral Becket's Crown, Kent, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|upright|Becket's crown at the far east side of the cathedral]]\nIn 1180\u20134, in place of the old, square-ended, eastern chapel, the present Trinity Chapel was constructed, a broad extension with an ambulatory, designed to house the shrine of St Thomas Becket.{{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=22\u201323}} A further chapel, circular in plan, was added beyond that, which housed further relics of Becket, {{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=22\u201323}} widely believed to have included the top of his skull, struck off in the course of his assassination. This latter chapel became known as the \"Corona\" or \"Becket's Crown\".{{sfn|Withers|1897|p=88\u201389}} These new parts east of the quire transepts were raised on a higher crypt than Ernulf's quire, necessitating  flights of steps between the two levels. Work on the chapel was completed in 1184, {{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=22\u201323}} but Becket's remains were not moved from his tomb in the crypt until 1220.{{sfn|Withers|1897|p=8}} Further  significant interments  in the Trinity Chapel included those of Edward Plantagenet (The \"[[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]]\") and King [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]].\n\nThe shrine in the Trinity Chapel was placed directly above Becket's original tomb in the crypt. A marble plinth, raised on columns, supported what an early visitor, [[Walter of Coventry]], described as \"a coffin wonderfully wrought of gold and silver, and marvellously adorned with precious gems\".{{sfn|Blick|2005|pp=407\u2013408}} Other accounts make clear that the gold was laid over a wooden chest, which in turn contained an iron-bound box holding Becket's remains.{{sfn|Blick|2005|p=408}} Further [[votive offering|votive treasures]] were added to the adornments of the chest over the years, while others were placed on pedestals or beams nearby, or attached to hanging drapery.{{sfn|Blick|2005|p=424}} For much of the time the chest (or \"[[feretory]]\") was kept concealed by a wooden cover, which would be theatrically raised by ropes once a crowd of pilgrims had gathered.{{sfn|Withers|1897|p=8}}{{sfn|Blick|2005|p=408}} The Dutch humanist [[Desiderius Erasmus]], who visited in 1512\u20131514, recorded that, once the cover was raised, \"the Prior ... pointed out each jewel, telling its name in French, its value, and the name of its donor; for the principal of them were offerings sent by sovereign princes.\"{{sfn|Blick|2005|p=425}}\n\nThe income from [[pilgrim]]s (such as those portrayed in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'') who visited Becket's shrine, which was regarded as a place of healing, largely paid for the subsequent rebuilding of the cathedral and its associated buildings. This revenue included the profits from the sale of [[pilgrim badge]]s depicting Becket, his martyrdom, or his shrine.\n\nThe shrine was removed in 1538. King Henry VIII summoned the dead saint to court to face charges of treason. Having failed to appear, he was found guilty in his absence and the treasures of his shrine  were confiscated, carried away in two coffers and 26 carts.{{sfn|Withers|1897|p=13}}\n\n====Monastic buildings====\n[[File:Canterbury Cathedral Cloisters, Kent, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Cloisters]]\nA bird's-eye view of  the cathedral and its monastic buildings, made  in about 1165<ref name=eb/> and known as the \"waterworks plan\" is preserved in the [[Eadwine Psalter]] in the library of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite book|title=English Romanesque Art  1066\u20131200|year=1984|publisher=Arts Councilof Great Britain|series=Catalogue of an Exhibition held at the Hayward Gallery, London, 5 April-8 July 1984|location=London|page=374}}</ref> It shows that Canterbury employed the same general principles of arrangement common to all [[Benedictine monasteries]], although, unusually, the [[cloister]] and monastic buildings were to the north, rather than the south of the church.

Adjoining it, on the north side, stood the cloister and the  buildings devoted  to the monastic life. To the east and west of these were those devoted to the exercise of hospitality. To the north a large open court divided the monastic buildings from menial ones, such as the stables, granaries, barn, bakehouse, brew house and laundries, inhabited by the lay servants of the establishment. At the greatest possible distance from the church, beyond the precinct of the monastery, was the eleemosynary department. The almonry for the relief of the poor, with a great hall annexed, formed the paupers' hospitium.<ref name=eb/>\n\n[[File:Canterbury cathedral plan.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of Canterbury Cathedral showing the complex ribbing of the [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]] vaulting in the [[nave]] and [[transept]]s]]\nThe group of buildings devoted to monastic life included two cloisters. The great cloister was surrounded by the buildings essentially connected  with the daily life of the monks: the church to the south, with the refectory placed as always on the side opposite, the dormitory, raised on a vaulted [[undercroft]], and the chapter-house adjacent, and the lodgings of the cellarer, responsible for providing both monks and guests with food, to the west. A passage under the dormitory led eastwards to the smaller or infirmary cloister, appropriated to sick and infirm monks.<ref name=eb/>\n\nThe hall and chapel of the infirmary extended east of  this cloister, resembling in form and arrangement the nave and chancel of an aisled church. Beneath the dormitory, overlooking the green court or herbarium, lay the \"pisalis\" or \"calefactory\", the [[common room]] of the monks. At its northeast corner access was given from the dormitory to the [[toilets|necessarium]], a building  in the form of a Norman hall, {{convert|145|ft}} long by {{convert|25|ft}} broad, containing 55 seats. It was constructed with  careful regard to hygiene, with a stream of water running through it from end to end.<ref name=eb/>\n\nA second smaller dormitory for the conventual officers ran  from east to west. Close to the refectory, but outside the cloisters, were the domestic offices connected with it: to the north, the kitchen, {{convert|47|ft}} square, with a pyramidal roof, and the kitchen court; to the west, the butteries, pantries, etc. The infirmary had a small kitchen of its own. Opposite the refectory door in the cloister were two lavatories, where  the monks washed before and after eating.<ref name=eb/>\n\n[[File:Canterbury-Cathedral-Church-of-England-1890-1900.jpg|thumb|View from the north west [[circa]] 1890\u20131900.]]\nThe buildings devoted to hospitality were divided into three groups. The prior's group  were \"entered at the south-east angle of the green court, placed near the most sacred part of the cathedral, as befitting the distinguished ecclesiastics or nobility who were assigned to him.\" The cellarer's buildings, where middle class visitors were  entertained, stood near the west end of the nave.

It was during this period that the wagon-vaulting of the chapter house was created.\n\nA shortage of money, and the priority given to the rebuilding of the cloisters and chapterhouse meant that the rebuilding of the west towers  was neglected. The south-west tower was not replaced until 1458, and the Norman north-west tower survived until  1834, when it was replaced by a  replica of its Perpendicular companion.{{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=43\u201345}}\n\nIn about 1430 the south transept apse was removed to make way for a chapel, founded by Lady Margaret Holland and dedicated to St Michael and  All Angels.

The cathedral is covered by a huge expanse of lead and whilst the majority of the wooden framework remains sound, much of the lead itself needs replacing. In addition, a large amount of concrete encasing the bottom of the roof beams needs to be removed and replaced with traditional wooden footers.\n\nConservation of the external masonry, particularly on the northern side of the building, is equally important. The cathedral is in part built of [[Caen stone]]. Detailed archaeological studies are undertaken to identify exactly which stones need to be replaced or repaired. In addition, specialist cleaning techniques are used to remove accumulated chemical deposits which are very damaging to the building. As regards the interior, priorities include decoration of the vaults of the [[Trinity Chapel]], major improvements to the Treasury building which contains, amongst other things, the choir practice rooms, and conservation work in several other chapels.\n\n[[File:Canterbury stained glass 7379.jpg|thumb|One of the many stained-glass windows at Canterbury Cathedral]]\n\nThe earliest coloured glass windows in the cathedral date from the late 12th century, whilst others are as new as the four [[Ervin Boss\u00e1nyi]] windows in the south-east transept (1957).

The major [[conservation-restoration]] projects already identified will cost \u00a330&nbsp;million. Fabric conservation is the most urgent element of the campaign. The appeal&nbsp;\u2013 the third of its kind following major fundraising drives at Canterbury in the 1950s and 1970s&nbsp;\u2013 was launched to fund these projects. [[Fundraising]] for the appeal will take place over a number of years both nationally and internationally, stressing the cathedral's role as the [[mother church]] of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] and as a [[World Heritage Site]]. An integrated conservation programme that addresses the priority areas has been drawn up by the cathedral's Surveyor to the Fabric, John Burton.\n\nMajor repair and conservation projects to be funded by the appeal include roofs of the nave, [[aisle]]s, and North West and South East [[Transept]]s; stone carvings, [[pinnacle]]s and stone facings of the [[Bell Harry Tower]]; work on the North side of the Corona Chapel;<ref name=\"BBC News\" /> conservation of the [[Christ Church Gate]] entry to the Precincts; conservation of stained glass and surrounding stonework throughout the cathedral; and preservation of the collection of historic books and [[manuscript]]s.\n\nIn addition, there are plans to refurbish the cathedral [[pipe organ]] and renovations to the [[Choir House]] have already been completed, providing better facilities for choristers. Improvements are planned to the fabric of the library buildings and to the cathedral's audio-visual and lighting systems which will significantly benefit visitors including the disabled, visually impaired and hard of hearing. The appeal also aims to develop the outmoded workshop area and [[stained glass]] studio, in order to ensure the survival of Canterbury as a [[centre of excellence]] for vital craft skills and to promote a sustainable maintenance base for work on the cathedral which can be viewed by the public.\n\nThe fund raising group is the Canterbury Cathedral Trust, an independent, registered charity (1112590) seeking funds to provide conservation, craftsmanship, music and education. Since mid-2017, the Chief Executive has been Sarah Frankland. The Trust was able to obtain the \u00a324.7m needed for The Canterbury Journey multi-year restoration programme which should be completed in 2021. In 2016/17 the Trust received \u00a33.66m in donations and an additional \u00a31.61m had been pledged for future projects. The next plan was to raise funds to restore and improve the Quire organ by 2020. In 2017, the Cathedral was planning to have the new Welcome Centre open in 2019, with exhibition spaces and viewing gallery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CCT-Annual-Report-2017.pdf|format=PDF|title=Annual Report|date=2017|website=Canterbury-cathedral.org|accessdate=30 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712052737/https://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CCT-Annual-Report-2017.pdf|archive-date=12 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n===Organ===\nThe organ at Canterbury is of three manuals with cases in the quire gallery and the north quire aisle.

It forms part of a [[World Heritage Site]]. It is the [[cathedral]] of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], currently [[Justin Welby]], leader of the [[Church of England]] and symbolic leader of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]].  Its formal title is the '''Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Christ at Canterbury'''.\n\nFounded in 597, the cathedral was completely rebuilt between 1070 and 1077. The east end was greatly enlarged at the beginning of the 12th century, and largely rebuilt in the Gothic style following a fire in 1174, with significant eastward extensions to accommodate the flow of pilgrims visiting the shrine of [[Thomas Becket]], the archbishop who was murdered in the cathedral in 1170. The Norman nave and transepts survived until the late 14th century, when they were demolished to make way for the present structures.\n\nBefore the [[English Reformation]] the cathedral was part of a [[Benedictine]] monastic community known as '''Christ Church, Canterbury''', as well as being the seat of the archbishop.\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman===\nChristianity had started to become powerful in the [[Roman Empire]] around the 3rd century. Following the conversion of [[Augustine of Hippo]] in the 4th century, the influence of Christianity grew steadily.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The cathedral's first bishop was [[Augustine of Canterbury]], previously [[abbot]] of [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio|St Andrew's Benedictine Abbey]] in Rome; when other dioceses were founded in England he was made archbishop. He was sent by [[Pope Gregory I]] in 596 as a missionary to the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxons]]. Augustine founded the cathedral in 597 and dedicated it to [[Jesus Christ]], the [[Holy Saviour]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Canterbury Cathedral- A Virtual Tour |accessdate=7 October 2008 |url=http://www.faculty.de.gcsu.edu/~dvess/ids/medieval/canterbury/canterbury.shtml |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228204322/http://www.faculty.de.gcsu.edu/~dvess/ids/medieval/canterbury/canterbury.shtml |archivedate=28 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nAugustine also founded the [[St Augustine's Abbey|Abbey of St Peter and Paul]] outside the [[Defensive wall|city walls]].

The king had frequent conflicts with the  strong-willed Becket and is said to have exclaimed in frustration, \"[[Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?]]\" Four knights took it literally and murdered Becket in his own cathedral. After the Anglo-Saxon [[\u00c6lfheah of Canterbury|\u00c6lfheah]], Becket was the second Archbishop of Canterbury to be murdered.\n\nThe posthumous veneration of Becket made the cathedral a place of pilgrimage. This brought both the need to expand the cathedral and the wealth that made it possible.\n\n====Rebuilding of the quire====\n[[File:TOMB OF THE BLACK PRINCE, CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL.jpg|thumb|Tomb of the [[Black Prince]]]]\nIn September 1174 the quire  was severely damaged by fire, necessitating a major reconstruction,{{sfn|Cook|1949|p=23}}  the progress of which was recorded in detail by a monk named [[Gervase of Canterbury|Gervase]].{{sfn|Willis|1845|p=xiv}} The crypt survived the fire intact,{{sfn|Willis|1845| p=71}} and it was found possible to retain the outer walls of the quire, which were increased in height by {{convert|12|ft|m}} in the course of the rebuilding, but with the round-headed form of their windows left unchanged.{{sfn|Willis|1845|p=79}} Everything else was replaced in the new Gothic style, with  pointed arches, rib vaulting and flying buttresses. The limestone used was imported from Caen in Normandy, and [[Purbeck marble]] was used for the shafting. The quire was back in use by 1180 and in that year the remains of Dunstan and \u00c6lfheah were moved there from the crypt.{{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nThe master-mason appointed to rebuild the quire was a Frenchman, [[William of Sens]]. Following his injury in a fall from the scaffolding in 1179 he was replaced by one of his former assistants, known as \"[[William the Englishman]]\".{{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=22\u201323}}\n\n====Trinity Chapel and Shrine of Thomas Becket====\n[[File:Canterbury Cathedral Trinity Chapel Stained Glass, Kent, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Stained glass in the Trinity Chapel]]\n[[File:Canterbury Cathedral Becket's Crown, Kent, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|upright|Becket's crown at the far east side of the cathedral]]\nIn 1180\u20134, in place of the old, square-ended, eastern chapel, the present Trinity Chapel was constructed, a broad extension with an ambulatory, designed to house the shrine of St Thomas Becket.{{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=22\u201323}} A further chapel, circular in plan, was added beyond that, which housed further relics of Becket, {{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=22\u201323}} widely believed to have included the top of his skull, struck off in the course of his assassination. This latter chapel became known as the \"Corona\" or \"Becket's Crown\".{{sfn|Withers|1897|p=88\u201389}} These new parts east of the quire transepts were raised on a higher crypt than Ernulf's quire, necessitating  flights of steps between the two levels. Work on the chapel was completed in 1184, {{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=22\u201323}} but Becket's remains were not moved from his tomb in the crypt until 1220.{{sfn|Withers|1897|p=8}} Further  significant interments  in the Trinity Chapel included those of Edward Plantagenet (The \"[[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]]\") and King [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]].\n\nThe shrine in the Trinity Chapel was placed directly above Becket's original tomb in the crypt. A marble plinth, raised on columns, supported what an early visitor, [[Walter of Coventry]], described as \"a coffin wonderfully wrought of gold and silver, and marvellously adorned with precious gems\".{{sfn|Blick|2005|pp=407\u2013408}} Other accounts make clear that the gold was laid over a wooden chest, which in turn contained an iron-bound box holding Becket's remains.{{sfn|Blick|2005|p=408}} Further [[votive offering|votive treasures]] were added to the adornments of the chest over the years, while others were placed on pedestals or beams nearby, or attached to hanging drapery.{{sfn|Blick|2005|p=424}} For much of the time the chest (or \"[[feretory]]\") was kept concealed by a wooden cover, which would be theatrically raised by ropes once a crowd of pilgrims had gathered.{{sfn|Withers|1897|p=8}}{{sfn|Blick|2005|p=408}} The Dutch humanist [[Desiderius Erasmus]], who visited in 1512\u20131514, recorded that, once the cover was raised, \"the Prior ... pointed out each jewel, telling its name in French, its value, and the name of its donor; for the principal of them were offerings sent by sovereign princes.\"{{sfn|Blick|2005|p=425}}\n\nThe income from [[pilgrim]]s (such as those portrayed in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'') who visited Becket's shrine, which was regarded as a place of healing, largely paid for the subsequent rebuilding of the cathedral and its associated buildings. This revenue included the profits from the sale of [[pilgrim badge]]s depicting Becket, his martyrdom, or his shrine.\n\nThe shrine was removed in 1538. King Henry VIII summoned the dead saint to court to face charges of treason. Having failed to appear, he was found guilty in his absence and the treasures of his shrine  were confiscated, carried away in two coffers and 26 carts.{{sfn|Withers|1897|p=13}}\n\n====Monastic buildings====\n[[File:Canterbury Cathedral Cloisters, Kent, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Cloisters]]\nA bird's-eye view of  the cathedral and its monastic buildings, made  in about 1165<ref name=eb/> and known as the \"waterworks plan\" is preserved in the [[Eadwine Psalter]] in the library of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite book|title=English Romanesque Art  1066\u20131200|year=1984|publisher=Arts Councilof Great Britain|series=Catalogue of an Exhibition held at the Hayward Gallery, London, 5 April-8 July 1984|location=London|page=374}}</ref> It shows that Canterbury employed the same general principles of arrangement common to all [[Benedictine monasteries]], although, unusually, the [[cloister]] and monastic buildings were to the north, rather than the south of the church.

Adjoining it, on the north side, stood the cloister and the  buildings devoted  to the monastic life. To the east and west of these were those devoted to the exercise of hospitality. To the north a large open court divided the monastic buildings from menial ones, such as the stables, granaries, barn, bakehouse, brew house and laundries, inhabited by the lay servants of the establishment. At the greatest possible distance from the church, beyond the precinct of the monastery, was the eleemosynary department. The almonry for the relief of the poor, with a great hall annexed, formed the paupers' hospitium.<ref name=eb/>\n\n[[File:Canterbury cathedral plan.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of Canterbury Cathedral showing the complex ribbing of the [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]] vaulting in the [[nave]] and [[transept]]s]]\nThe group of buildings devoted to monastic life included two cloisters. The great cloister was surrounded by the buildings essentially connected  with the daily life of the monks: the church to the south, with the refectory placed as always on the side opposite, the dormitory, raised on a vaulted [[undercroft]], and the chapter-house adjacent, and the lodgings of the cellarer, responsible for providing both monks and guests with food, to the west. A passage under the dormitory led eastwards to the smaller or infirmary cloister, appropriated to sick and infirm monks.<ref name=eb/>\n\nThe hall and chapel of the infirmary extended east of  this cloister, resembling in form and arrangement the nave and chancel of an aisled church. Beneath the dormitory, overlooking the green court or herbarium, lay the \"pisalis\" or \"calefactory\", the [[common room]] of the monks. At its northeast corner access was given from the dormitory to the [[toilets|necessarium]], a building  in the form of a Norman hall, {{convert|145|ft}} long by {{convert|25|ft}} broad, containing 55 seats. It was constructed with  careful regard to hygiene, with a stream of water running through it from end to end.<ref name=eb/>\n\nA second smaller dormitory for the conventual officers ran  from east to west. Close to the refectory, but outside the cloisters, were the domestic offices connected with it: to the north, the kitchen, {{convert|47|ft}} square, with a pyramidal roof, and the kitchen court; to the west, the butteries, pantries, etc. The infirmary had a small kitchen of its own. Opposite the refectory door in the cloister were two lavatories, where  the monks washed before and after eating.<ref name=eb/>\n\n[[File:Canterbury-Cathedral-Church-of-England-1890-1900.jpg|thumb|View from the north west [[circa]] 1890\u20131900.]]\nThe buildings devoted to hospitality were divided into three groups. The prior's group  were \"entered at the south-east angle of the green court, placed near the most sacred part of the cathedral, as befitting the distinguished ecclesiastics or nobility who were assigned to him.\" The cellarer's buildings, where middle class visitors were  entertained, stood near the west end of the nave.

It was during this period that the wagon-vaulting of the chapter house was created.\n\nA shortage of money, and the priority given to the rebuilding of the cloisters and chapterhouse meant that the rebuilding of the west towers  was neglected. The south-west tower was not replaced until 1458, and the Norman north-west tower survived until  1834, when it was replaced by a  replica of its Perpendicular companion.{{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=43\u201345}}\n\nIn about 1430 the south transept apse was removed to make way for a chapel, founded by Lady Margaret Holland and dedicated to St Michael and  All Angels. The north transept apse was replaced by a Lady Chapel, built in 1448\u20131455.{{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=43\u201345}}\n\nThe {{convert|235|ft|adj=on}} crossing tower was begun in 1433, although preparations had  already been made during Chillenden's priorate, when the piers had been reinforced. Further strengthening was found necessary around the beginning of the 16th century, when buttressing arches were added under the southern and western tower arches.  The tower is often known as the \"Angel Steeple\", after a gilded angel that once stood on one of its pinnacles.{{sfn|Cook|1949|pp=43\u201345}}\n\n===Modern period===\n[[File:Canterbury Cathedral font, Kent, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The decorative font in the nave]]\n\n====The Reformation, Dissolution and Puritanism====\n\nThe cathedral ceased to be an abbey during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] when all religious houses were suppressed. Canterbury surrendered in March 1539, and reverted to its previous status of 'a college of secular canons'.

The last quinquennial structural review<ref name=newsletterMay2014>{{cite web|title=Spring/Summer Newsletter 2014|url=http://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/trust_newsletter_web.pdf|publisher=Canterbury Cathedral Trust|access-date=28 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528220849/http://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/trust_newsletter_web.pdf|archive-date=28 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> revealed that a combination of centuries of weathering, pollution and constant use had taken its toll on the ancient building and some serious problems were in need of urgent action.\n\nThe single biggest challenge is the roof. The cathedral is covered by a huge expanse of lead and whilst the majority of the wooden framework remains sound, much of the lead itself needs replacing. In addition, a large amount of concrete encasing the bottom of the roof beams needs to be removed and replaced with traditional wooden footers.\n\nConservation of the external masonry, particularly on the northern side of the building, is equally important. The cathedral is in part built of [[Caen stone]]. Detailed archaeological studies are undertaken to identify exactly which stones need to be replaced or repaired. In addition, specialist cleaning techniques are used to remove accumulated chemical deposits which are very damaging to the building. As regards the interior, priorities include decoration of the vaults of the [[Trinity Chapel]], major improvements to the Treasury building which contains, amongst other things, the choir practice rooms, and conservation work in several other chapels.\n\n[[File:Canterbury stained glass 7379.jpg|thumb|One of the many stained-glass windows at Canterbury Cathedral]]\n\nThe earliest coloured glass windows in the cathedral date from the late 12th century, whilst others are as new as the four [[Ervin Boss\u00e1nyi]] windows in the south-east transept (1957).

The aim was to raise \u00a350&nbsp;million; by the end of 2010 the appeal had raised \u00a311.5&nbsp;million,<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|title=Canterbury Cathedral appeal reaches \u00a311.5m|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-11978543|work=[[BBC News]]|date=12 December 2010|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122182902/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-11978543|archive-date=22 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and as at May 2014 over \u00a320&nbsp;million had been raised.<ref name=newsletterMay2014 />\n\nThe core part of the fundraising programme is focused on the cathedral's fabric. The major [[conservation-restoration]] projects already identified will cost \u00a330&nbsp;million. Fabric conservation is the most urgent element of the campaign. The appeal&nbsp;\u2013 the third of its kind following major fundraising drives at Canterbury in the 1950s and 1970s&nbsp;\u2013 was launched to fund these projects. [[Fundraising]] for the appeal will take place over a number of years both nationally and internationally, stressing the cathedral's role as the [[mother church]] of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] and as a [[World Heritage Site]]. An integrated conservation programme that addresses the priority areas has been drawn up by the cathedral's Surveyor to the Fabric, John Burton.\n\nMajor repair and conservation projects to be funded by the appeal include roofs of the nave, [[aisle]]s, and North West and South East [[Transept]]s; stone carvings, [[pinnacle]]s and stone facings of the [[Bell Harry Tower]]; work on the North side of the Corona Chapel;<ref name=\"BBC News\" /> conservation of the [[Christ Church Gate]] entry to the Precincts; conservation of stained glass and surrounding stonework throughout the cathedral; and preservation of the collection of historic books and [[manuscript]]s.\n\nIn addition, there are plans to refurbish the cathedral [[pipe organ]] and renovations to the [[Choir House]] have already been completed, providing better facilities for choristers. Improvements are planned to the fabric of the library buildings and to the cathedral's audio-visual and lighting systems which will significantly benefit visitors including the disabled, visually impaired and hard of hearing. The appeal also aims to develop the outmoded workshop area and [[stained glass]] studio, in order to ensure the survival of Canterbury as a [[centre of excellence]] for vital craft skills and to promote a sustainable maintenance base for work on the cathedral which can be viewed by the public.\n\nThe fund raising group is the Canterbury Cathedral Trust, an independent, registered charity (1112590) seeking funds to provide conservation, craftsmanship, music and education. Since mid-2017, the Chief Executive has been Sarah Frankland. The Trust was able to obtain the \u00a324.7m needed for The Canterbury Journey multi-year restoration programme which should be completed in 2021. In 2016/17 the Trust received \u00a33.66m in donations and an additional \u00a31.61m had been pledged for future projects. The next plan was to raise funds to restore and improve the Quire organ by 2020. In 2017, the Cathedral was planning to have the new Welcome Centre open in 2019, with exhibition spaces and viewing gallery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CCT-Annual-Report-2017.pdf|format=PDF|title=Annual Report|date=2017|website=Canterbury-cathedral.org|accessdate=30 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712052737/https://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CCT-Annual-Report-2017.pdf|archive-date=12 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n===Organ===\nThe organ at Canterbury is of three manuals with cases in the quire gallery and the north quire aisle.
