Many kinds of e-bikes are available worldwide, from e-bikes that only have a small motor to assist the rider's pedal-power (i.e. pedelecs) to more powerful e-bikes which are closer to [[moped]]-style functionality. All retain the ability to be [[Bicycle pedal|pedalled]] by the rider and are therefore not [[electric motorcycles]]. \n\nE-bikes use [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]] and the lighter ones can travel up to {{Convert|25|to|32|km/h|abbr=on}}, depending on local laws, while the more high-powered varieties can often do more than {{Convert|45|km/h|abbr=on}}.  In some markets, such as Germany {{asof|2013|lc=1}}, they are gaining in popularity and taking some market share away from conventional bicycles,<ref>{{cite web|title=Electric Bikes Now Constitute 10 Percent of German Market \n |url=http://www.evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=29891\n |work=EVworld.com |accessdate=3 April 2013 |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910022452/http://evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=29891 |archivedate=10 September 2013 }}</ref> while in others, such as China {{asof|2010|lc=1}}, they are replacing [[fossil fuel]]-powered [[moped]]s and small motorcycles.<ref name=NYT0110/><ref name=USAToday0210>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/environment/2010-02-11-electricbikes11_ST_N.htm\n |title=Electric bikes face long road in U.S.\n |publisher=[[USA Today]]|author=Kathy Chu\n |date=2010-02-12|accessdate=2010-05-31}}</ref>\n\nDepending on local laws, many e-bikes (e.g., ''pedelecs'') are legally classified as bicycles rather than [[moped]]s or [[motorcycle]]s.  This exempts them from the more stringent laws regarding the certification and operation of more powerful two-wheelers which are often classed as [[electric motorcycles]].  E-bikes can also be defined separately and treated under distinct [[Electric bicycle laws]].\n\nE-bikes are the [[electric motor]]-powered versions of [[motorized bicycle]]s, which have been in use since the late 19th century.  Some [[bicycle-sharing system]]s use them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ggwash.org/view/65501/its-not-a-bike-its-a-bike-shaped-uber-that-says-jump\n |title=It's not a bike, it's a bike-shaped Uber that says \"JUMP\"|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ebike1932.jpg|thumb|E-bike 1932 (by [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium|Philips]] & Simplex)]]\nIn the 1890s, electric bicycles were documented within various U.S. patents. For example, on 31 December 1895, Ogden Bolton Jr. was granted {{US Patent|552271}} for a battery-powered bicycle with \"6-pole brush-and-commutator direct current (DC) hub motor mounted in the rear wheel\".  There were no gears and the motor could draw up to 100 amperes (A) from a 10-volt battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US552271A/en|title=Electrical bicycle|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later, in 1897, Hosea W. Libbey of Boston invented an electric bicycle ({{US Patent|596272}}) that was propelled by a \"double electric motor\". The motor was designed within the hub of the [[crankset]] axle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US596272A/en|title=Electric bicycle|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020}}</ref> This model was later re-invented and imitated in the late 1990s by Giant Lafree e-bikes.\n\n[[File:Electricbike1raleigh.JPG|thumb|A bike equiped with an after market eletric hub motor conversation kit, with the battery pack placed on the rear carrier rack]]\n\nBy 1898 a rear-wheel drive electric bicycle, which used a [[Drive belt|driving belt]] along the outside edge of the wheel, was patented by Mathew J. Steffens.  Also, the 1899 {{US Patent|627066}} by John Schnepf depicted a rear-wheel friction \u201croller-wheel\u201d style drive electric bicycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US627066A/en|title=schnepf|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020}}</ref>  Schnepf's invention was later re-examined and expanded in 1969 by G.A. Wood Jr. with his {{US Patent|3,431,994}}.  Wood\u2019s device used 4 [[fractional horsepower motors]]; connected through a series of gears.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US3431994A/en|title=Electric drive for bicycles|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Torque sensor]]s and [[power control]]s were developed in the late 1990s. For example, Takada Yutky of Japan filed a patent in 1997 for such a device.  In 1992 Vector Services Limited offered and sold an e-bike dubbed [[Sinclair Zike|Zike]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zikebike.com/about.htm |title=Electric Bikes \u2013 Zike Bike Spares & Sales |publisher=Zikebike.com |accessdate=2009-08-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424081452/http://www.zikebike.com/about.htm |archivedate=2009-04-24 }}</ref> The bicycle included NiCd batteries that were built into a frame member and included an 850&nbsp;g permanent-magnet motor. Despite the Zike, in 1992 hardly any commercial e-bikes were available.\n\nYamaha, a Japanese automotive giant built one of the early prototypes of ebike back in 1989 and invented the pedal assist system in 1993.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.yamahabicycles.com/the-yamaha-evolution/ |title = Best e Bike &#124; Yamaha e Bikes}}</ref>\n\nProduction grew from 1993 to 2004 by an estimated 35%. By contrast, according to Gardner, in 1995 regular bicycle production decreased from its peak 107 million units.\n\nAmerican car icon, Lee Iacocca founded EV Global motors in 1997, a company that produced an electric bicycle model named E-bike SX and it was one of the early efforts to popularize ebikes in the United States. <ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/21/business/investing-it-a-bet-on-electric-bikes-or-at-least-on-lee-iacocca.html |title = INVESTING IT; A Bet on Electric Bikes, or at Least on Lee Iacocca|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1997-09-21|last1 = Tergesen|first1 = Anne}}</ref>\n\nSome of the less expensive e-bikes used bulky lead acid batteries, whereas newer models generally used NiMH, NiCd, and/or Li-ion batteries, which offered lighter, denser capacity batteries. Performance varies; however, in general there is an increase in range and speed with the latter battery types.\n\n[[File:BLDCBicycleHubMotor.jpg|thumb|BLDC Bicycle Hub Motor]]\n\nBy 2001 the terms e-bike, power bike, \"[[pedelec]]\", pedal-assisted, and power-assisted bicycle were commonly used to refer to e-bikes. The terms \"electric motorbike\" or \"e-motorbike\" refer to more powerful models that attain up to {{convert|80|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn a parallel hybrid motorized bicycle, such as the aforementioned 1897 invention by Hosea W. Libbey, human and motor inputs are mechanically coupled either in the [[bottom bracket]], the rear wheel, or the front wheel, whereas in a (mechanical) series hybrid cycle, the human and motor inputs are coupled through differential gearing. In an (electronic) series hybrid cycle, human power is converted into electricity and is fed directly into the motor and mostly additional electricity is supplied from a battery.\n\nBy 2007 e-bikes were thought to make up 10 to 20 percent of all two-wheeled vehicles on the streets of many major Chinese cities.<ref name=tim-johnson/> A typical unit requires 8 hours to charge the battery, which provides the range of {{convert|25|to|30|mi}},<ref name=tim-johnson/> at the speed of around 20&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=fairley/>\n\n== Classes ==\n[[File:Schematic of an Pedelec.svg|thumb|Schematic of a Pedelec]]\n[[File:Schematic of an E-Bike.svg|thumb|Schematic of an E-Bike]]\n[[File:Hyperbikes.jpg|thumb|right|Different types of e-bikes]]\n\nE-bikes are classed according to the power that their electric motor can deliver and the control system, i.e., when and how the power from the motor is applied. Also the classification of e-bikes is complicated as much of the definition is due to [[#Legal status|legal reasons]] of what constitutes a bicycle and what constitutes a moped or motorcycle. As such, the classification of these e-bikes varies greatly across countries and local jurisdictions.\n\nDespite these legal complications, the classification of e-bikes is mainly decided by whether the e-bike's motor assists the rider using a ''pedal-assist'' system or by a ''power-on-demand'' one. Definitions of these are as follows:\n*With '''pedal-assist''' the electric motor is regulated by pedalling. The pedal-assist augments the efforts of the rider when they are pedalling. These e-bikes \u2013 called [[pedelec]]s \u2013 have a sensor to detect the pedalling speed, the pedalling force, or both. Brake activation is sensed to disable the motor as well.\n*With '''power-on-demand''' the motor is activated by a [[throttle]], usually handlebar-mounted just like on most motorcycles or scooters.\n\nTherefore, very broadly, e-bikes can be classed as:\n* ''E-bikes with pedal-assist only'': either ''pedelecs'' (legally classed as bicycles) or ''S-Pedelecs'' (often legally classed as [[moped]]s)\n** ''Pedelecs'': have pedal-assist only, motor assists only up to a decent but not excessive speed (usually 25&nbsp;km/h), motor power up to 250 [[watt]]s, often legally classed as bicycles \n** ''S-Pedelecs'': have pedal-assist only, motor power can be greater than 250 watts, can attain a higher speed (e.g., 45&nbsp;km/h) before motor stops assisting, legally classed as a moped or motorcycle ('''not''' a bicycle)\n* ''E-bikes with power-on-demand'' and ''pedal-assist''\n* ''E-bikes with power-on-demand only'': often have more powerful motors than pedelecs but not always, the more powerful of these are legally classed as mopeds or motorcycles\n\n=== Pedal-assist only ===\nE-bikes with pedal-assist only are usually called ''pedelecs'' but can be broadly classified into pedelecs proper and the more powerful S-Pedelecs.\n\n==== Pedelecs ====\n{{main|Pedelec}}\n\nThe term \"[[pedelec]]\" (from '''ped'''al '''ele'''ctric '''c'''ycle) refers to a ''pedal-assist'' e-bike with a relatively low-powered electric motor and a decent but not excessive top speed.  Pedelecs are legally classed as bicycles rather than low-powered motorcycles or mopeds.\n\nThe most influential definition of pedelecs and which are not comes from the [[European Union|EU]].  EU directive (EN15194 standard) for motor vehicles considers a bicycle to be a pedelec if:\n# the ''pedal-assist'', i.e. the motorised assistance that only engages when the rider is pedalling, cuts out once 25&nbsp;km/h is reached, and\n# when the motor produces ''maximum continuous rated power'' of not more than 250 watts (n.b. the motor can produce more power for short periods, such as when the rider is struggling to get up a steep hill).\nAn e-bike conforming to these conditions is considered to be a pedelec in the EU and is legally classed as a [[bicycle]]. The EN15194 standard is valid across the whole of the EU and has also been adopted by some non-EU European nations and also some non-European jurisdictions (such as the [[state of Victoria]] in Australia).<ref>{{cite web|title=Power assisted bicycles |url=http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/SafetyAndRules/SaferRiders/BikeRiders/PowerAssistedBicycles.htm\n |work=VicRoads website |publisher=[[VicRoads]] |accessdate=25 August 2013 |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328200435/http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/SafetyAndRules/SaferRiders/BikeRiders/PowerAssistedBicycles.htm |archivedate=28 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nPedelecs are much like conventional bicycles in use and function \u2014 the electric motor only provides assistance, for example, when the rider is climbing or struggling against a headwind.  Pedelecs are therefore especially useful for people in hilly areas where riding a bike would prove too strenuous for many to consider taking up cycling as a daily means of transport.  They are also useful for riders who more generally need some assistance, e.g. for people with heart, leg muscle or knee joint issues.\n\n==== S-Pedelecs ====\nMore powerful pedelecs which are not legally classed as bicycles are dubbed '''S-Pedelecs''' (short for ''Schnell-Pedelecs'', i.e. Speedy-Pedelecs) in Germany. These have a motor more powerful than 250 watts and less limited, or unlimited, pedal-assist, i.e. the motor does not stop assisting the rider once 25&nbsp;km/h has been reached. S-Pedelec class e-bikes are therefore usually classified as [[moped]]s or motorcycles rather than as bicycles and therefore may (depending on the jurisdiction) need to be registered and insured, the rider may need some sort of driver's license (either car or motorcycle) and motorcycle helmets may have to be worn.<ref>{{cite web|title=Was Sie \u00fcber den Versicherungsschutz von pedelecs wissen sollten|url=http://www.gdv.de/2012/08/was-sie-ueber-den-versicherungsschutz-von-pedelecs-wissen-sollten/|publisher=Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft (German Insurance Association)|language=German|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref> In the United States, many states have adopted S-Pedelecs into the Class 3 category. Class 3 ebikes are limited to <=750 watts of power and 28&nbsp;mph.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://electricbikereview.com/guides/electric-bike-classes/ | title=What Are Electric Bike Classes and Why do They Matter?}}</ref>\n\n=== Power-on-demand and pedal-assist ===\nSome of the newer electric bikes include a pedal assist system (PAS) with or without throttle. This allows users to pedal alongside the electric motor to increase distance per charge. There are also electric bike conversion kits for turning non-electric bikes into e-bikes.\n\n=== Power-on-demand only ===\nSome e-bikes have an electric motor that operates on a '''power-on-demand''' basis only. In this case, the electric motor is engaged and operated manually using a throttle, which is usually on the handgrip just like the ones on a motorbike or scooter. These sorts of e-bikes often, but not always, have more powerful motors than pedelecs do.\n\nWith ''power-on-demand only'' e-bikes the rider can:\n# ride by pedal power alone, i.e. fully human-powered.\n# ride by electric motor alone by operating the throttle manually.\n# ride using both together at the same time.\n\nSome power-on-demand only e-bikes can hardly be confused with, let alone categorised as, bicycles. For example, the ''Noped'' is a term used by the Ministry of Transportation of [[Ontario]] for e-bikes which do not have pedals or in which the pedals have been removed from their motorised bicycle. These are better categorised as electric [[moped]]s or [[electric motorcycle]]s.\n\n==Legal status==\n{{Main|Electric bicycle laws}}\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2010}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Many configurations are available, varying in cost and complexity; direct-drive and [[gear]]ed motor units are both used.  An electric power-assist system may be added to almost any pedal cycle using chain drive, belt drive, [[wheel hub motor|hub motor]]s or friction drive. [[Brushless DC electric motor|BLDC]] hub motors are a common modern design.  The motor is built into the wheel hub itself, while the stator is fixed solidly to the axle, and the magnets are attached to and rotating with the wheel.  The bicycle wheel hub is the motor.  The power levels of motors used are influenced by available legal categories and are often, but not always limited to under 750&nbsp;watts.\n\nAnother type of electric assist motor, often referred to as the [[mid-drive]] system, is increasing in popularity. With this system, the electric motor is not built into the wheel but is usually mounted near (often under) the [[bottom bracket]] shell. In more typical configurations, a cog or wheel on the motor drives a belt or chain that engages with a pulley or sprocket fixed to one of the arms of the bicycle's [[crankset]]. Thus the propulsion is provided at the pedals rather than at the wheel, being eventually applied to the wheel via the bicycle's standard drive train.\n\nBecause the power is applied through the chain and sprocket, power is typically limited to around 250\u2013500 watts to protect against fast wear on the drivetrain.  An electric mid-drive combined with an internal gear hub at the back hub may require care due to the lack of a [[clutch]] mechanism to soften the shock to the gears at the moment of re-engagement.  A [[continuously variable transmission]] or a fully automatic internal gear hub may reduce the shocks due to the viscosity of oils used for liquid coupling instead of the mechanical couplings of the conventional internal gear hubs.\n\n===Batteries===\nE-bikes use [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]], [[electric motor]]s and some form of control.   Battery systems in use include [[lead\u2013acid battery|sealed lead-acid]] (SLA), [[Nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] (NiCad), [[Nickel-metal hydride battery|nickel-metal hydride]] (NiMH) or [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion polymer]] (Li-ion). Batteries vary according to the voltage, total charge capacity (amp hours), weight, the number of charging cycles before performance degrades, and ability to handle over-voltage charging conditions. The energy costs of operating e-bikes are small, but there can be considerable battery replacement costs. The lifespan of a battery pack varies depending on the type of usage. Shallow discharge/recharge cycles will help extend the overall battery life.\n\nRange is a key consideration with e-bikes, and is affected by factors such as motor efficiency, battery capacity, efficiency of the driving electronics, aerodynamics, hills and weight of the bike and rider.<ref>{{cite web\n| last =\n| first =\n| authorlink =\n| title = Electric bike trip simulator\n| website =\n| date =\n| url = http://www.electricbikerange.info/Electric_bike_range.html\n| doi =\n| accessdate = 2013-05-25}}\n</ref><ref>\"[http://www.electric-bicycle-guide.com/electric-bicycle-range.html Electric Bicycle Range]\"; Electric Bicycle Guide (retrieved 2014-03-09)</ref> Some manufacturers, such as the Canadian [[BionX]] or American Vintage Electric Bikes,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.vintageelectricbikes.com/ |title = The Fastest Electric Bike &#124; Vintage Electric Bikes}}</ref> have the option of using [[regenerative brake|regenerative braking]], the motor acts as a generator to slow the bike down prior to the brake pads engaging.<ref>{{cite web|title=BionX FAQ Page|url=http://www.bionx.ca/en/support/faq/|accessdate=2010-03-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322230111/http://www.bionx.ca/en/support/faq/|archivedate=2010-03-22}}\n</ref>  This is useful for extending the range and the life of brake pads and wheel rims.

Brushless motors are becoming more common as the cost of controllers continues to decrease.  (See the page on [[DC motor]]s which covers the differences between these two types.)\n\n''Controllers for brushless motors'': E-bikes require high initial torque and therefore models that use brushless motors typically have [[Hall sensor]] commutation for speed and angle measurement. An [[Electronic speed control|electronic controller]] provides assistance as a function of the sensor inputs, the vehicle speed and the required force. The controllers generally allow input by means of potentiometer or Hall Effect twist grip (or thumb-operated lever throttle), closed-loop speed control for precise speed regulation, protection logic for over-voltage, over-current and thermal protection. Bikes with a pedal assist function typically have a disc on the [[crank shaft]] featuring a ring of magnets coupled with a [[Hall sensor]] giving rise to a series of pulses, the frequency of which is proportional to pedaling speed. The controller uses [[pulse-width modulation|pulse width modulation]] to regulate the power to the motor. Sometimes support is provided for [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] but infrequent braking and the low mass of bicycles limits recovered energy. An implementation is described in an [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718160416/http://www.zilog.com/docs/z8encoremc/appnotes/AN0260.pdf application note] for a 200 W, 24 V Brushless DC (BLDC) motor.<ref name=ElectricBikeBLDCHubMotorControl>{{cite news|url=http://www.zilog.com/docs/z8encoremc/appnotes/AN0260.pdf |title=Electric Bike BLDC Hub Motor Control |publisher=Zilog, Inc |author=Zilog, Inc |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718160416/http://www.zilog.com/docs/z8encoremc/appnotes/AN0260.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 }}</ref>\n\n''Controllers for brushed motors'': Brushed motors are also used in e-bikes but are becoming less common due to their intrinsic lower efficiency. Controllers for brushed motors however are much simpler and cheaper due to the fact they do not require [[hall sensor]] feedback and are typically designed to be open-loop controllers.

There were no gears and the motor could draw up to 100 amperes (A) from a 10-volt battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US552271A/en|title=Electrical bicycle|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later, in 1897, Hosea W. Libbey of Boston invented an electric bicycle ({{US Patent|596272}}) that was propelled by a \"double electric motor\". The motor was designed within the hub of the [[crankset]] axle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US596272A/en|title=Electric bicycle|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020}}</ref> This model was later re-invented and imitated in the late 1990s by Giant Lafree e-bikes.\n\n[[File:Electricbike1raleigh.JPG|thumb|A bike equipped with an after market electric hub motor conversion kit, with the battery pack placed on the rear carrier rack]]\n\nBy 1898 a rear-wheel drive electric bicycle, which used a [[Drive belt|driving belt]] along the outside edge of the wheel, was patented by Mathew J. Steffens.  Also, the 1899 {{US Patent|627066}} by John Schnepf depicted a rear-wheel friction \u201croller-wheel\u201d style drive electric bicycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US627066A/en|title=schnepf|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020}}</ref>  Schnepf's invention was later re-examined and expanded in 1969 by G.A. Wood Jr. with his {{US Patent|3,431,994}}.  Wood\u2019s device used 4 [[fractional horsepower motors]]; connected through a series of gears.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US3431994A/en|title=Electric drive for bicycles|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Torque sensor]]s and [[power control]]s were developed in the late 1990s. For example, Takada Yutky of Japan filed a patent in 1997 for such a device.  In 1992 Vector Services Limited offered and sold an e-bike dubbed [[Sinclair Zike|Zike]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zikebike.com/about.htm |title=Electric Bikes \u2013 Zike Bike Spares & Sales |publisher=Zikebike.com |accessdate=2009-08-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424081452/http://www.zikebike.com/about.htm |archivedate=2009-04-24 }}</ref> The bicycle included NiCd batteries that were built into a frame member and included an 850&nbsp;g permanent-magnet motor. Despite the Zike, in 1992 hardly any commercial e-bikes were available.\n\nYamaha, a Japanese automotive giant built one of the early prototypes of ebike back in 1989 and invented the pedal assist system in 1993.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.yamahabicycles.com/the-yamaha-evolution/ |title = Best e Bike &#124; Yamaha e Bikes}}</ref>\n\nProduction grew from 1993 to 2004 by an estimated 35%. By contrast, according to Gardner, in 1995 regular bicycle production decreased from its peak 107 million units.\n\nAmerican car icon, Lee Iacocca founded EV Global motors in 1997, a company that produced an electric bicycle model named E-bike SX and it was one of the early efforts to popularize ebikes in the United States. <ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/21/business/investing-it-a-bet-on-electric-bikes-or-at-least-on-lee-iacocca.html |title = INVESTING IT; A Bet on Electric Bikes, or at Least on Lee Iacocca|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1997-09-21|last1 = Tergesen|first1 = Anne}}</ref>\n\nSome of the less expensive e-bikes used bulky lead acid batteries, whereas newer models generally used NiMH, NiCd, and/or Li-ion batteries, which offered lighter, denser capacity batteries. Performance varies; however, in general there is an increase in range and speed with the latter battery types.\n\n[[File:BLDCBicycleHubMotor.jpg|thumb|BLDC Bicycle Hub Motor]]\n\nBy 2001 the terms e-bike, power bike, \"[[pedelec]]\", pedal-assisted, and power-assisted bicycle were commonly used to refer to e-bikes. The terms \"electric motorbike\" or \"e-motorbike\" refer to more powerful models that attain up to {{convert|80|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn a parallel hybrid motorized bicycle, such as the aforementioned 1897 invention by Hosea W. Libbey, human and motor inputs are mechanically coupled either in the [[bottom bracket]], the rear wheel, or the front wheel, whereas in a (mechanical) series hybrid cycle, the human and motor inputs are coupled through differential gearing. In an (electronic) series hybrid cycle, human power is converted into electricity and is fed directly into the motor and mostly additional electricity is supplied from a battery.\n\nBy 2007 e-bikes were thought to make up 10 to 20 percent of all two-wheeled vehicles on the streets of many major Chinese cities.<ref name=tim-johnson/> A typical unit requires 8 hours to charge the battery, which provides the range of {{convert|25|to|30|mi}},<ref name=tim-johnson/> at the speed of around 20&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=fairley/>\n\n== Classes ==\n[[File:Schematic of an Pedelec.svg|thumb|Schematic of a Pedelec]]\n[[File:Schematic of an E-Bike.svg|thumb|Schematic of an E-Bike]]\n[[File:Hyperbikes.jpg|thumb|right|Different types of e-bikes]]\n\nE-bikes are classed according to the power that their electric motor can deliver and the control system, i.e., when and how the power from the motor is applied. Also the classification of e-bikes is complicated as much of the definition is due to [[#Legal status|legal reasons]] of what constitutes a bicycle and what constitutes a moped or motorcycle. As such, the classification of these e-bikes varies greatly across countries and local jurisdictions.\n\nDespite these legal complications, the classification of e-bikes is mainly decided by whether the e-bike's motor assists the rider using a ''pedal-assist'' system or by a ''power-on-demand'' one. Definitions of these are as follows:\n*With '''pedal-assist''' the electric motor is regulated by pedalling. The pedal-assist augments the efforts of the rider when they are pedalling. These e-bikes \u2013 called [[pedelec]]s \u2013 have a sensor to detect the pedalling speed, the pedalling force, or both. Brake activation is sensed to disable the motor as well.\n*With '''power-on-demand''' the motor is activated by a [[throttle]], usually handlebar-mounted just like on most motorcycles or scooters.\n\nTherefore, very broadly, e-bikes can be classed as:\n* ''E-bikes with pedal-assist only'': either ''pedelecs'' (legally classed as bicycles) or ''S-Pedelecs'' (often legally classed as [[moped]]s)\n** ''Pedelecs'': have pedal-assist only, motor assists only up to a decent but not excessive speed (usually 25&nbsp;km/h), motor power up to 250 [[watt]]s, often legally classed as bicycles \n** ''S-Pedelecs'': have pedal-assist only, motor power can be greater than 250 watts, can attain a higher speed (e.g., 45&nbsp;km/h) before motor stops assisting, legally classed as a moped or motorcycle ('''not''' a bicycle)\n* ''E-bikes with power-on-demand'' and ''pedal-assist''\n* ''E-bikes with power-on-demand only'': often have more powerful motors than pedelecs but not always, the more powerful of these are legally classed as mopeds or motorcycles\n\n=== Pedal-assist only ===\nE-bikes with pedal-assist only are usually called ''pedelecs'' but can be broadly classified into pedelecs proper and the more powerful S-Pedelecs.\n\n==== Pedelecs ====\n{{main|Pedelec}}\n\nThe term \"[[pedelec]]\" (from '''ped'''al '''ele'''ctric '''c'''ycle) refers to a ''pedal-assist'' e-bike with a relatively low-powered electric motor and a decent but not excessive top speed.  Pedelecs are legally classed as bicycles rather than low-powered motorcycles or mopeds.\n\nThe most influential definition of pedelecs and which are not comes from the [[European Union|EU]].  EU directive (EN15194 standard) for motor vehicles considers a bicycle to be a pedelec if:\n# the ''pedal-assist'', i.e. the motorised assistance that only engages when the rider is pedalling, cuts out once 25&nbsp;km/h is reached, and\n# when the motor produces ''maximum continuous rated power'' of not more than 250 watts (n.b. the motor can produce more power for short periods, such as when the rider is struggling to get up a steep hill).\nAn e-bike conforming to these conditions is considered to be a pedelec in the EU and is legally classed as a [[bicycle]]. The EN15194 standard is valid across the whole of the EU and has also been adopted by some non-EU European nations and also some non-European jurisdictions (such as the [[state of Victoria]] in Australia).<ref>{{cite web|title=Power assisted bicycles |url=http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/SafetyAndRules/SaferRiders/BikeRiders/PowerAssistedBicycles.htm\n |work=VicRoads website |publisher=[[VicRoads]] |accessdate=25 August 2013 |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328200435/http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/SafetyAndRules/SaferRiders/BikeRiders/PowerAssistedBicycles.htm |archivedate=28 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nPedelecs are much like conventional bicycles in use and function \u2014 the electric motor only provides assistance, for example, when the rider is climbing or struggling against a headwind.  Pedelecs are therefore especially useful for people in hilly areas where riding a bike would prove too strenuous for many to consider taking up cycling as a daily means of transport.  They are also useful for riders who more generally need some assistance, e.g. for people with heart, leg muscle or knee joint issues.\n\n==== S-Pedelecs ====\nMore powerful pedelecs which are not legally classed as bicycles are dubbed '''S-Pedelecs''' (short for ''Schnell-Pedelecs'', i.e. Speedy-Pedelecs) in Germany. These have a motor more powerful than 250 watts and less limited, or unlimited, pedal-assist, i.e. the motor does not stop assisting the rider once 25&nbsp;km/h has been reached. S-Pedelec class e-bikes are therefore usually classified as [[moped]]s or motorcycles rather than as bicycles and therefore may (depending on the jurisdiction) need to be registered and insured, the rider may need some sort of driver's license (either car or motorcycle) and motorcycle helmets may have to be worn.<ref>{{cite web|title=Was Sie \u00fcber den Versicherungsschutz von pedelecs wissen sollten|url=http://www.gdv.de/2012/08/was-sie-ueber-den-versicherungsschutz-von-pedelecs-wissen-sollten/|publisher=Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft (German Insurance Association)|language=German|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref> In the United States, many states have adopted S-Pedelecs into the Class 3 category. Class 3 ebikes are limited to <=750 watts of power and 28&nbsp;mph.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://electricbikereview.com/guides/electric-bike-classes/ | title=What Are Electric Bike Classes and Why do They Matter?}}</ref>\n\n=== Power-on-demand and pedal-assist ===\nSome of the newer electric bikes include a pedal assist system (PAS) with or without throttle. This allows users to pedal alongside the electric motor to increase distance per charge. There are also electric bike conversion kits for turning non-electric bikes into e-bikes.\n\n=== Power-on-demand only ===\nSome e-bikes have an electric motor that operates on a '''power-on-demand''' basis only. In this case, the electric motor is engaged and operated manually using a throttle, which is usually on the handgrip just like the ones on a motorbike or scooter. These sorts of e-bikes often, but not always, have more powerful motors than pedelecs do.\n\nWith ''power-on-demand only'' e-bikes the rider can:\n# ride by pedal power alone, i.e. fully human-powered.\n# ride by electric motor alone by operating the throttle manually.\n# ride using both together at the same time.\n\nSome power-on-demand only e-bikes can hardly be confused with, let alone categorised as, bicycles. For example, the ''Noped'' is a term used by the Ministry of Transportation of [[Ontario]] for e-bikes which do not have pedals or in which the pedals have been removed from their motorised bicycle. These are better categorised as electric [[moped]]s or [[electric motorcycle]]s.\n\n==Legal status==\n{{Main|Electric bicycle laws}}\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2010}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Many configurations are available, varying in cost and complexity; direct-drive and [[gear]]ed motor units are both used.  An electric power-assist system may be added to almost any pedal cycle using chain drive, belt drive, [[wheel hub motor|hub motor]]s or friction drive. [[Brushless DC electric motor|BLDC]] hub motors are a common modern design.  The motor is built into the wheel hub itself, while the stator is fixed solidly to the axle, and the magnets are attached to and rotating with the wheel.  The bicycle wheel hub is the motor.  The power levels of motors used are influenced by available legal categories and are often, but not always limited to under 750&nbsp;watts.\n\nAnother type of electric assist motor, often referred to as the [[mid-drive]] system, is increasing in popularity. With this system, the electric motor is not built into the wheel but is usually mounted near (often under) the [[bottom bracket]] shell. In more typical configurations, a cog or wheel on the motor drives a belt or chain that engages with a pulley or sprocket fixed to one of the arms of the bicycle's [[crankset]]. Thus the propulsion is provided at the pedals rather than at the wheel, being eventually applied to the wheel via the bicycle's standard drive train.\n\nBecause the power is applied through the chain and sprocket, power is typically limited to around 250\u2013500 watts to protect against fast wear on the drivetrain.  An electric mid-drive combined with an internal gear hub at the back hub may require care due to the lack of a [[clutch]] mechanism to soften the shock to the gears at the moment of re-engagement.  A [[continuously variable transmission]] or a fully automatic internal gear hub may reduce the shocks due to the viscosity of oils used for liquid coupling instead of the mechanical couplings of the conventional internal gear hubs.\n\n===Batteries===\nE-bikes use [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]], [[electric motor]]s and some form of control.   Battery systems in use include [[lead\u2013acid battery|sealed lead-acid]] (SLA), [[Nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] (NiCad), [[Nickel-metal hydride battery|nickel-metal hydride]] (NiMH) or [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion polymer]] (Li-ion). Batteries vary according to the voltage, total charge capacity (amp hours), weight, the number of charging cycles before performance degrades, and ability to handle over-voltage charging conditions. The energy costs of operating e-bikes are small, but there can be considerable battery replacement costs. The lifespan of a battery pack varies depending on the type of usage. Shallow discharge/recharge cycles will help extend the overall battery life.\n\nRange is a key consideration with e-bikes, and is affected by factors such as motor efficiency, battery capacity, efficiency of the driving electronics, aerodynamics, hills and weight of the bike and rider.<ref>{{cite web\n| last =\n| first =\n| authorlink =\n| title = Electric bike trip simulator\n| website =\n| date =\n| url = http://www.electricbikerange.info/Electric_bike_range.html\n| doi =\n| accessdate = 2013-05-25}}\n</ref><ref>\"[http://www.electric-bicycle-guide.com/electric-bicycle-range.html Electric Bicycle Range]\"; Electric Bicycle Guide (retrieved 2014-03-09)</ref> Some manufacturers, such as the Canadian [[BionX]] or American Vintage Electric Bikes,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.vintageelectricbikes.com/ |title = The Fastest Electric Bike &#124; Vintage Electric Bikes}}</ref> have the option of using [[regenerative brake|regenerative braking]], the motor acts as a generator to slow the bike down prior to the brake pads engaging.<ref>{{cite web|title=BionX FAQ Page|url=http://www.bionx.ca/en/support/faq/|accessdate=2010-03-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322230111/http://www.bionx.ca/en/support/faq/|archivedate=2010-03-22}}\n</ref>  This is useful for extending the range and the life of brake pads and wheel rims.  There are also experiments using [[fuel cell]]s. e.g. the [[PHB (bicycle)|PHB]].\nSome experiments have also been undertaken with [[electric double-layer capacitor|super capacitor]]s to supplement or replace batteries for cars and some SUVS.\nE-bikes developed in Switzerland in the late 1980s for the [[Tour de Sol]] solar vehicle race came with [[solar power|solar]] [[charging station]]s but these were later fixed on roofs and connected so as to feed into the electric [[Mains electricity|mains]].<ref>Technisches \"Reglement der Tour de Sol 1989/1990\", published by Tour de Sol, Bern, Switzerland</ref>  The bicycles were then charged from the mains, as is common today. While ebike batteries were produced mainly by bigger companies in past, many small to medium companies have started using innovative new methods for creating more durable batteries.

Brushless motors are becoming more common as the cost of controllers continues to decrease.  (See the page on [[DC motor]]s which covers the differences between these two types.)\n\n''Controllers for brushless motors'': E-bikes require high initial torque and therefore models that use brushless motors typically have [[Hall sensor]] commutation for speed and angle measurement. An [[Electronic speed control|electronic controller]] provides assistance as a function of the sensor inputs, the vehicle speed and the required force. The controllers generally allow input by means of potentiometer or Hall Effect twist grip (or thumb-operated lever throttle), closed-loop speed control for precise speed regulation, protection logic for over-voltage, over-current and thermal protection. Bikes with a pedal assist function typically have a disc on the [[crank shaft]] featuring a ring of magnets coupled with a [[Hall sensor]] giving rise to a series of pulses, the frequency of which is proportional to pedaling speed. The controller uses [[pulse-width modulation|pulse width modulation]] to regulate the power to the motor. Sometimes support is provided for [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] but infrequent braking and the low mass of bicycles limits recovered energy. An implementation is described in an [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718160416/http://www.zilog.com/docs/z8encoremc/appnotes/AN0260.pdf application note] for a 200 W, 24 V Brushless DC (BLDC) motor.<ref name=ElectricBikeBLDCHubMotorControl>{{cite news|url=http://www.zilog.com/docs/z8encoremc/appnotes/AN0260.pdf |title=Electric Bike BLDC Hub Motor Control |publisher=Zilog, Inc |author=Zilog, Inc |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718160416/http://www.zilog.com/docs/z8encoremc/appnotes/AN0260.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 }}</ref>\n\n''Controllers for brushed motors'': Brushed motors are also used in e-bikes but are becoming less common due to their intrinsic lower efficiency. Controllers for brushed motors however are much simpler and cheaper due to the fact they do not require [[hall sensor]] feedback and are typically designed to be open-loop controllers. Some controllers can handle multiple voltages.\n\n==Design variations==\n[[File:Electric Bicycle Diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram illustrating a standard bicycle converted to an e-bike using a retail conversion kit]]\n[[File:Electro bike, Brno.jpg|thumb|A folding e-bike]]\nNot all e-bikes take the form of conventional push-bikes with an incorporated motor, such as the [[Cytronex]] bicycles which use a small battery disguised as a water bottle.<ref>{{cite news\n| last = Henshaw\n| first = Peter\n| authorlink =\n| title = Cytronex Trek FX: A bike with boost\n| work =\n| publisher = The Telegraph\n| date = 2008-09-05\n| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/motorbikes/adventureandtrailmotorbikes/2979610/Cytronex-Trek-FX-A-bike-with-boost.html\n| doi =\n| accessdate = }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| last = Peace\n| first = Richard\n| authorlink =\n| title = Electric bikes start to come of age\n| website =\n| publisher = Future Publishing\n| date = 2008-08-26\n| url = http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/electric-bikes-start-to-come-of-age--18203\n| doi =\n| accessdate = }}\n</ref>\nSome are designed to take the appearance of low capacity motorcycles, but smaller in size and consisting of an electric motor rather than a petrol engine.

In general, the kits include the motor (the majority of which are hub motors built into the front or rear wheel), a speed controller, throttle (usually twist-grip or thumb throttle), necessary wiring and connectors, and a battery.  Several U.S. companies offer conversion kits which also offer advanced lithium battery packs.  Major manufacturers also offer complete e-bikes. Trek offers a line of e-bikes using the Bionx system in which the rider programs the controller to determine how much effort the motor will give in response to rider effort, from 25% up to 200% of the rider's power.  This system ensures a minimum level of rider participation and is also used to comply with many European laws mandating partial human effort before the motor engages.\n\n=== Japan ===\nIn 2017, the first e-BIKE \"XM-1\" in Japan was released in market by [[Panasonic]]. And \"YPJ-R\" was also released in same month by [[Yamaha Motor Company|YAMAHA]].\n\nFrom 2018, some e-BIKE tours were released.

(It is often referred to as \"Roman Catholic\", occasionally as \"Catholic High\", and most commonly as \"Roman\".) The \"Catholic Girls High School\" was founded in 1912. Mary McMichan, one of the school's founders, requested in her last will that the school be renamed in honor of her brother.  The school became \"John W. Hallahan Catholic Girls High School\" after her death. Both schools are still in existence.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1927 West Catholic Boys and Girls and Northeast Catholic were opened. Despite the economic hardships of the 1930s and 1940s, seven more diocesan high schools were founded.

The two Earp brothers had been attacked in retaliation for the deaths of three Cowboys in the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] on October 26, 1881. From March&nbsp;20 to April&nbsp;15, 1882, the federal posse searched southeast [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]], [[Arizona Territory]] for the men they believed were responsible for the attacks on Virgil and Morgan. Several suspects had been identified and were charged, but were soon released by the court, owing in some cases to [[legal technicality|legal technicalities]] and in others to the strength of [[alibi]]s provided by Cowboy confederates. Wyatt hoped that the legal system would bring the Cowboys to justice, but after suspects in both ambushes were freed, Wyatt resolved to take matters into his own hands.<ref name=wgbh>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/wyatt-transcript/ |title=WGBH American Experience: Wyatt Earp, Complete Program Transcript |date=January 25, 2010 |season=22 |number=2 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130081133/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/wyatt-transcript/ |archivedate=January 30, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nOn March&nbsp;20, two days after Morgan's murder, Wyatt, his brothers [[Warren Earp|Warren]] and [[James Earp|James]], [[Doc Holliday]], and two other deputies were escorting Virgil and his wife Allie to a California-bound train in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. They learned that suspects [[Ike Clanton]] and  [[Frank Stilwell]] were already waiting there. After Virgil, Allie, and James boarded the train, Wyatt spotted two men near the train that he thought were Clanton and Stilwell. He and several men chased down and killed Stilwell, but lost the other. After Stilwell's body was found the next morning, the Tucson Justice of the Peace issued arrest warrants for the five lawmen suspected of the [[extra-judicial]] murder. When the men returned to Tombstone, Cochise County [[Sheriffs in the United States#Arizona|Sheriff]] [[Johnny Behan]] had received a telegram notifying him of the Tucson warrants, and attempted to detain the five members of Earp's federal posse named in the warrants, but they ignored him. Still carrying arrest warrants for [[William Brocius|Curly Bill Brocius]] and others, they left Tombstone to pursue further Cowboys implicated in the attacks.\n\nBehan formed a Cochise County sheriff's posse consisting of [[Deputy sheriff|deputies]] [[Phineas Clanton]], [[Johnny Ringo]], and about twenty other Cowboys and Arizona ranchers. Based on the local warrants, they followed the Earp posse and set out to arrest them.  The large sheriff's posse came close to, but never engaged, the much smaller Earp posse, which  received help from local businessmen and ranchers (and at one point, published a letter in a Tombstone newspaper taunting Behan and his men). The federal posse ultimately killed four men, starting with Stilwell and ending with Brocius. About April&nbsp;15 the Earps and some of their associates rode out of Arizona Territory, headed for [[New Mexico Territory]].\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{details|topic=conflicts between Cochise County towns people and rural Cowboys|Cochise County in the Old West}}\nAfter a long-simmering feud and increasing animosity and threats, [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] town Marshal [[Virgil Earp]], Assistant Town Marshal [[Morgan Earp]], and temporary deputy marshals [[Wyatt Earp]] and [[Doc Holliday]] confronted [[outlaw]] [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]] [[Billy Claiborne]], [[Ike Clanton|Ike]] and [[Billy Clanton]], and [[Tom McLaury|Tom]] and [[Frank McLaury]] in the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] on October 26, 1881. The 30-second [[gunfighter|gunfight]] is generally regarded as the most famous gunfight in the history of the [[American Wild West]]. The lawmen killed three of the Cowboys during the gunfight. Ike Clanton filed murder charges, and after a month-long  [[O.K. Corral hearing and aftermath|preliminary hearing]], Justice of the Peace [[Wells Spicer]] found that the lawmen had acted within their duty. But Spicer's finding did not end the matter for Clanton and other Cowboys.\n\n=== Attempted murder of Virgil Earp ===\n{{main|Virgil Earp}}\n\nAt about 11:30 pm on December 28, 1881, just over two months after the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, three men ambushed [[Virgil Earp]] as he walked from Schieffelin Hall back to the Cosmopolitan Hotel, where the Earps had moved for mutual support and protection.<ref name=explorers>{{cite web|last=Rose|first=John|url=http://www.wyattearpexplorers.com/wyatts-house.html|title=Wyatt's House|accessdate=February 11, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220145548/http://www.wyattearpexplorers.com/wyatts-house.html|archivedate=December 20, 2010}}</ref> He was hit in the back and upper left arm by about 20 buckshot pellets, shattering his [[humerus]].

McMaster had seen service with the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] in 1878-1879 when his unit captured and held [[Curly Bill Brocius]] prisoner for five months. In Tombstone, McMaster had also been accused of stealing U.S. Army mules and robbing a stage with outlaw [[Pony Diehl|Charles \"Pony\" Diehl]]. Fluent in Spanish, McMaster used his inside knowledge of the Cowboys to assist the Earps in their search. He also liked fine horses.<ref name=\"historynet\"/>\n\nJack \"Turkey Creek\" Johnson, whose real name according to Wyatt Earp was John William Blount, was a native of Missouri who was raised in the lead mining area of Neosho. Blount was forced to flee Missouri in 1877 after he and his brother were involved in a violent street battle. In Arizona during May 1881, his brother Bud killed a man in a quarrel in [[Tip Top, Arizona|Tip Top]], Arizona Territory, and was sent to [[Yuma Territorial Prison]]. John Blount adopted the alias Jack Johnson and went to Tombstone seeking Wyatt Earp's help to get his brother pardoned. Wyatt helped by writing a petition to Governor Fremont, whom Wyatt knew, and Bud Blount was eventually freed. As a way to repay his debt, Johnson joined the posse.<ref name=\"historynet\"/>\n\nCharlie Smith had a long-time connection to the Earp family, and was fluent in Spanish after spending several years in Texas working in [[Western saloon|saloons]]. While in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] he had been associated with barman [[James Earp]],<ref name=\"historynet\"/> and participated in at least two gunfights there, and was seriously wounded in 1878. Arriving in Tombstone in 1879 with Robert J. Winders, Smith immediately became associated with the Earps. Winders and the Earps partnered on the Mountain Maid mine.<ref name=\"historynet\"/>\n\nDaniel \"Tip\" Tipton arrived in Tombstone in March&nbsp;1881. He had a shady reputation earned during the early days of the mining boom in [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]], [[Nevada Territory]]. Tipton, a former [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] seaman in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], was tattooed on his hands and forearms, and took up mining and gambling after the war. In 1879 he was in the [[Gunnison, Colorado|Gunnison]] district of Colorado before traveling to Tombstone at the request of his friend Lou Rickabaugh, also a friend of the Earps.<ref name=\"historynet\"/> Smith and Tipton were gamblers who supplemented their income with mining ventures.<ref name=\"historynet\"/>\n\nJohn \"Texas Jack\" Vermillion, a Virginian, joined the vendetta ride after Frank Stilwell was killed, and was never indicted for Stilwell's murder, but he was with the Earps when Florentino \"Indian Charlie\" Cruz was killed. Although closer to friend and fellow Southerner Doc Holliday than the Earps, Vermillion remained by Wyatt Earp's side during the shootout at Iron Springs with Curly Bill Brocius. A veteran of the Civil War on the Confederate side who rode with [[J. E. B. Stuart|J.E.B.

Ringo, still in jail, learned that the Earps had warrants and were headed for Charleston. He arranged for bail and Sheriff Behan released him before the bail payment arrived.

They learned that suspects [[Ike Clanton]] and  [[Frank Stilwell]] were already waiting there. After Virgil, Allie, and James boarded the train, Wyatt spotted two men near the train that he thought were Clanton and Stilwell. He and several men chased down and killed Stilwell, but lost the other. After Stilwell's body was found the next morning, the Tucson Justice of the Peace issued arrest warrants for the five lawmen suspected of the [[extra-judicial]] murder. When the men returned to Tombstone, Cochise County [[Sheriffs in the United States#Arizona|Sheriff]] [[Johnny Behan]] had received a telegram notifying him of the Tucson warrants, and attempted to detain the five members of Earp's federal posse named in the warrants, but they ignored him. Still carrying arrest warrants for [[William Brocius|Curly Bill Brocius]] and others, they left Tombstone to pursue further Cowboys implicated in the attacks.\n\nBehan formed a Cochise County sheriff's posse consisting of [[Deputy sheriff|deputies]] [[Phineas Clanton]], [[Johnny Ringo]], and about twenty other Cowboys and Arizona ranchers. Based on the local warrants, they followed the Earp posse and set out to arrest them.  The large sheriff's posse came close to, but never engaged, the much smaller Earp posse, which  received help from local businessmen and ranchers (and at one point, published a letter in a Tombstone newspaper taunting Behan and his men). The federal posse ultimately killed four men, starting with Stilwell and ending with Brocius. About April&nbsp;15 the Earps and some of their associates rode out of Arizona Territory, headed for [[New Mexico Territory]].\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{details|topic=conflicts between Cochise County towns people and rural Cowboys|Cochise County in the Old West}}\nAfter a long-simmering feud and increasing animosity and threats, [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] town Marshal [[Virgil Earp]], Assistant Town Marshal [[Morgan Earp]], and temporary deputy marshals [[Wyatt Earp]] and [[Doc Holliday]] confronted [[outlaw]] [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]] [[Billy Claiborne]], [[Ike Clanton|Ike]] and [[Billy Clanton]], and [[Tom McLaury|Tom]] and [[Frank McLaury]] in the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] on October 26, 1881. The 30-second [[gunfighter|gunfight]] is generally regarded as the most famous gunfight in the history of the [[American Wild West]]. The lawmen killed three of the Cowboys during the gunfight. Ike Clanton filed murder charges, and after a month-long  [[O.K. Corral hearing and aftermath|preliminary hearing]], Justice of the Peace [[Wells Spicer]] found that the lawmen had acted within their duty. But Spicer's finding did not end the matter for Clanton and other Cowboys.\n\n=== Attempted murder of Virgil Earp ===\n{{main|Virgil Earp}}\n\nAt about 11:30 pm on December 28, 1881, just over two months after the Gunfight at the O.K.

McMaster had seen service with the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] in 1878-1879 when his unit captured and held [[Curly Bill Brocius]] prisoner for five months. In Tombstone, McMaster had also been accused of stealing U.S. Army mules and robbing a stage with outlaw [[Pony Diehl|Charles \"Pony\" Diehl]]. Fluent in Spanish, McMaster used his inside knowledge of the Cowboys to assist the Earps in their search. He also liked fine horses.<ref name=\"historynet\"/>\n\nJack \"Turkey Creek\" Johnson, whose real name according to Wyatt Earp was John William Blount, was a native of Missouri who was raised in the lead mining area of Neosho. Blount was forced to flee Missouri in 1877 after he and his brother were involved in a violent street battle. In Arizona during May 1881, his brother Bud killed a man in a quarrel in [[Tip Top, Arizona|Tip Top]], Arizona Territory, and was sent to [[Yuma Territorial Prison]]. John Blount adopted the alias Jack Johnson and went to Tombstone seeking Wyatt Earp's help to get his brother pardoned. Wyatt helped by writing a petition to Governor Fremont, whom Wyatt knew, and Bud Blount was eventually freed. As a way to repay his debt, Johnson joined the posse.<ref name=\"historynet\"/>\n\nCharlie Smith had a long-time connection to the Earp family, and was fluent in Spanish after spending several years in Texas working in [[Western saloon|saloons]]. While in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] he had been associated with barman [[James Earp]],<ref name=\"historynet\"/> and participated in at least two gunfights there, and was seriously wounded in 1878.

Ringo, still in jail, learned that the Earps had warrants and were headed for Charleston. He arranged for bail and Sheriff Behan released him before the bail payment arrived.

They caught their former allies in Tombstone unarmed and shot three of them dead while their hands were uplifted.\" Behan went on to say, \"They were hauled up before a Justice of the Peace...

The series served as a continuation of ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1967\u20131978) and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on four consecutive Saturday nights from August 18 to September 8, 1979.\n\n==Production background==\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' had completed its eleven-season run on [[CBS]], [[Carol Burnett]] and her then husband-manager [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]] were dining in a restaurant with friends (including [[Tim Conway]] from ''The Carol Burnett Show''). At that gathering, Burnett started reminiscing about the old show and making suggestions to Conway of future [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] that she wished they could create if the show was still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series; Conway immediately agreed.\n\nTaking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton then approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979, but CBS already had their schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was interested and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced and most of Burnett's former staff and crew were on board for the new series.\n\n==Overview==\nUnder the title ''Carol Burnett & Company'', the new series continued the same format of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which combined comedy sketches and musical numbers including favorite characters/sketches such as \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\", \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", \"[[The Oldest Man (character)|The Oldest Man]]\", \"The Charwoman\" and Burnett's impersonation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].  \n\nThe series also featured Conway and [[Vicki Lawrence]] back as regulars; due to the unavailability of [[Harvey Korman]], comic actors [[Craig Richard Nelson]] and [[Kenneth Mars]] were added to the supporting cast; Ernie Flatt, who had been the choreographer on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' during its entire run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars during the four-week period were chronologically [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]] and [[Sally Field]].  The show also introduced new sketches and characters, including another one of Conway's creations: a preacher named \"Rolly D. Tucker\" who gave humorously misguided sermons about life, with shouts of \"It don't matter!\" interspersed throughout his dissertation (Conway would later use this character on [[The Tim Conway Show (1980 TV series)|his own variety show]] when it premiered in March 1980).\n\n==Episode list==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!

The series served as a continuation of ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1967\u20131978) and aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] for four consecutive weeks on Saturdays from August 18 to September 8, 1979.\n\n==Production background==\nIn the spring of 1979, a year after ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' had completed its eleven-season run on [[CBS]], [[Carol Burnett]] and her then husband-manager [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]] were dining in a restaurant with friends (including [[Tim Conway]] from ''The Carol Burnett Show''). At that gathering, Burnett started reminiscing about the old show and making suggestions to Conway of future [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] that she wished they could create if the show was still running. Hamilton suggested to Burnett that she do a summer series; Conway immediately agreed.\n\nTaking that idea, Burnett and Hamilton then approached CBS about doing a four-week program in the summer of 1979, but CBS already had their schedule filled for the summer months and rejected the idea. However, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was interested and as a result, four postscript episodes of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' were produced and most of Burnett's former staff and crew were on board for the new series.\n\n==Overview==\nUnder the title ''Carol Burnett & Company'', the new series continued the same format of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which combined comedy sketches and musical numbers including favorite characters/sketches such as \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\", \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\", \"[[As the Stomach Turns]]\", \"[[The Oldest Man (character)|The Oldest Man]]\", \"The Charwoman\" and Burnett's impersonation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].  \n\nThe series also featured Conway and [[Vicki Lawrence]] back as regulars; due to the unavailability of [[Harvey Korman]], comic actors [[Craig Richard Nelson]] and [[Kenneth Mars]] were added to the supporting cast; Ernie Flatt, who had been the choreographer on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' during its entire run, was replaced by the show's lead dancer Don Crichton. The guest stars during the four-week period were chronologically [[Cheryl Ladd]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Penny Marshall]] and [[Sally Field]].  The show also introduced new sketches and characters, including another one of Conway's creations: a preacher named \"Rolly D. Tucker\" who gave humorously misguided sermons about life, with shouts of \"It don't matter!\" interspersed throughout his dissertation (Conway would later use this character on [[The Tim Conway Show (1980 TV series)|his own variety show]] when it premiered in March 1980).\n\n==Episode list==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!
