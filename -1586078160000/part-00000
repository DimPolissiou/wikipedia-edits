It was founded by [[K. M. George (politician)|K. M. George]]. This party is based on the state \n[[Kerala]]. The party had went through many splits and mergers. The party is now dissolved into many other parties such as: [[Kerala Congress (M)]], [[Kerala Congress (Jacob)]], [[Kerala Congress (B)]], [[Kerala Congress (Democratic)]], [[Kerala Congress (Skaria Thomas)]] , \n[[Kerala Congress (Thomas)]] , [[Kerala Congress (Nationalist)]], \n[[Janadhipathya Kerala Congress]].\nAmong these [[Kerala Congress (M)]] is recognised as a State Party by [[Election Commission of India]]\n\n==Current Factions==\n* [[Kerala Congress (M) | Kerala Congress (M) Joseph]] led by the late [[KM Mani]] and currently led by [[P.

Factions included the parent under [[P. J. Joseph]], [[Kerala Congress (Mani Group)|Kerala Congress (Mani)]] under [[K. M. Mani]], [[Kerala Congress (Balakrishna Pillai)]] under [[R. Balakrishna Pillai]], and [[Kerala Congress (Jacob)]] under [[Johnny Nellore]]. The group that had retained the official recognition by the [[Election Commission of India]] to the name 'Kerala Congress' was the one led by [[P. J. Joseph]] (which is informally called the [[Kerala Congress (Joseph)|Joseph group]]) <ref>{{cite web |author=Kerala Legislature |url=http://niyamasabha.org/codes/pparty1.htm |title=Kerala legislative assembly |publisher=Niyamasabha.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707061010/http://niyamasabha.org/codes/pparty1.htm |archive-date=7 July 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> until 2010.\n\n===1977 Split - Kerala Congress (B)===\nKerala Congress grew under K. M. George. R. Balakrishna Pillai was another founding leader of the party. Besides these two leaders  Karingozhakkal Mani Mani, popularly called K.M. Mani and P. J. Joseph, the youth front leader rose as prominent leaders of the party. After the death of K. M. George in 1976, there was tussle for control over the party between Balakrishna Pillai and K. M Mani. Pillai felt, as the senior most leader, he would be the de facto leader of the party. However Mani and Joseph had more followers. In the year 1977, just before the Assembly elections, R. Balakrishna Pillai announced a split from the parent Kerala Congress. This group came to be known as [[Kerala Congress (Balakrishna Pillai)]] with R. Balakrishna Pillai as the Chairman. In the Assembly elections of 1977 Kerala Congress stayed with [[United Democratic Front (Kerala)|UDF]] and secured 20 seats where as Pillai group secured 2 seats with [[Left Democratic Front (Kerala)|LDF]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=1977 KC and Pilla Group|url=http://kerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3776:history-of-kerala-legislature|title=History of Kerala Legislature|website=Kerala.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101549/http://kerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3776%3Ahistory-of-kerala-legislature|archivedate=2014-10-06}}</ref>\n\n====1979 Split - Kerala Congress (M)====\nKerala Congress was again split in the year 1979, when veteran Indian politician and the then Minister of Home Affairs in the Kerala government, Karingozhakkal Mani Mani, popularly called K.M. Mani, announced a split from the parent Kerala Congress, owing to difference of opinions with [[P. J. Joseph]]. This group came to be known as Kerala Congress (M) with [[K. M. Mani]] as the Chairman. In the 1979 Panchayat elections Kerala Congress (M) stayed with U. D. F. and Kerala Congress under P. J. Joseph stayed with L. D. F. In 1980 Assembly elections both factions switched the sides. Kerala Congress (M) moved over to L. D. F. along with Congress Leader A. K. Antony and Kerala Congress under P. J. Joseph moved over to U. D. F. Later Kerala Congress (M) returned to the U. D. F. All three factions represented the U. D. F. in 1982 Assembly lections as separate entities. In the 1982 U. D. F government, K. M Mani (Finance), P. J. Joseph (Revenue), R. Balakrishna Pilai (Transport), T. M. Jacob ( Education) became ministers.\n\n====1985 Merger - Kerala Congress====\nIn 1985 the Kerala Congress (M) and [[Kerala Congress (Balakrishna Pillai)]] merged with its parent Kerala Congress under P. J. Joseph while the two factions realized that the splits are indeed weakening the party. The merged Kerala Congress had 25 MLAs and 4 Ministers. On 25 May 1985, at a public meeting at Ernakulam, R Balakrishna Pllai, then a Minister in the Kerala Cabinet, allegedly incited the people to resort to protests like 'Punjab Model' to get the rights of Kerala State. This became a huge controversy and Pillai was forced to resign from the Cabinet and his portfolio was given to K. M Mani. Later the High Court of Kerala gave relief to Pillai. On this grounds the Kerala Congress under Chairman P. J. Joseph requested the then Chief Minister K. Karunakaran to reindic Pillai to the cabinet. Karunakaran saw this as an opportunity to weaken Kerala Congress and took a stand that for Pillai to be re-indicted to the cabinet Kerala Congress has to surrender the Finance portfolio held by Mani or be content with 3 minister ships. This caused Mani to be upset and following a sequence of events, the seeds of another split was already sown.\n\n====1987 Split - Kerala Congress (M)====\nJust before the Assembly elections of 1987 the differences between the factions under K. M Mani and P. J. Joseph got wider following the 'Punjab Model' speech issue. The Kerala Congress was again split when Mani famously declared 'If it is a split, So be it'. The faction under [[K. M. Mani]] was again known as Kerala Congress (M). Pillai and Joseph remained as Kerala Congress. T. M Jacob choose to stay with K. M Mani. In general there was a discontent among the Kerala Congress leaders that K. M. Mani was not putting the interests of the party, but a large number of ordinary party men stayed with Mani. A lot of Mani's earlier loyal leadership team including the leaders who were initially chosen by Mani to negotiate with Joseph, like O. Lukose and P. C. Joseph had to finally align with Joseph in the political situation that unfolded. However K. M. Mani still commanded a lot of loyalty in ordinary party men who were unaware of the insider information.\n\n====1993 Split - Kerala Congress (Jacob)====\nOn 16 December 1993, then Irrigation Affairs Minister [[T. M. Jacob]] MLA along with Johny Nellore MLA, P. M. Mathew MLA, Mathew Stephen MLA, Oommen Mathew, Vakkanad Radhakrishnan, and George Kunnappuzha split from Kerala Congress (M)citing differences with [[K. M. Mani]]. The newly formed faction was called Kerala Congress (Jacob).\n\n====Late 2000 splits and mergers - Kerala Congress (Secular) and IFDP====\nP. C. Thomas, son of [[P. T. Chacko]] who was part of Kerala Congress (M) and was the sitting M.P from Muvattupuzha had growing differences with [[K. M. Mani]]. This caused a split of a group of leaders from Kerala Congress (M) to form Indian Federal Democratic Party (I.F.D.P). IFDP tried to form a national level alliance but failed. Meanwhile, the parent Kerala Congress under [[P. J. Joseph]] also got split when [[P. C. George]] formed the Kerala Congress (Secular) splitting away from parent Kerala Congress under [[P. J. Joseph]].\n\nLater [[Indian Federal Democratic Party]] (I.F.D.P), under [[P. C. Thomas]] which split from the Mani group, merged with the Joseph group. A section of the Indian Federal Democratic Party under M. P. George retains its own cadre. In October 2009, [[Kerala Congress (Secular)]] under [[P. C. George]], which split from the [[Kerala Congress (Joseph)|Joseph group]], merged with the [[Kerala Congress (M)|Mani group]]. A section of the [[Kerala Congress (Secular)]] denied the merger and began to be known as Kerala Congress (Socialist). Kerala Congress Socialist soon got dissolved when it merged with the [[Janata Dal (Secular)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2010040161620500.htm&date=2010/04/01/&prd=th& |title=Kerala Congress (Socialist) to merge with Janata Dal (S) faction |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2010-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125705/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2010040161620500.htm&date=2010%2F04%2F01%2F&prd=th& |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Moves for United Kerala Congress====\nThere were several unofficial moves for bringing back the various splinter groups together under one umbrella ever since the first split of 1979. In 2007, [[Kerala Congress (Mani Group)|Kerala Congress (Mani)]], [[Kerala Congress (Secular)]], [[Kerala Congress (Balakrishna Pillai)]], and [[Kerala Congress (Jacob)]] tried to form a united forum, but this was unsuccessful.\n\n===United Kerala Congress===\n[[P. J. Joseph]] announced on 30 April 2010 the intention of his group to leave the [[Left Democratic Front (Kerala)|Left Democratic Front]] (LDF), of which his group had been a constituent for two decades, and merge with the group led by [[K.

The party is now dissolved into many other parties such as: [[Kerala Congress (M)]], [[Kerala Congress (Jacob)]], [[Kerala Congress (B)]], [[Kerala Congress (Democratic)]], [[Kerala Congress (Skaria Thomas)]] , \n[[Kerala Congress (Thomas)]] , [[Kerala Congress (Nationalist)]], \n[[Janadhipathya Kerala Congress]].\nAmong these [[Kerala Congress (M)]] is recognised as a State Party by [[Election Commission of India]]\n\n==Current Factions==\n* [[Kerala Congress (M) | Kerala Congress (M) Joseph]] led by the late [[KM Mani]] and currently led by [[P.

Factions included the parent under [[P. J. Joseph]], [[Kerala Congress (Mani Group)|Kerala Congress (Mani)]] under [[K. M. Mani]], [[Kerala Congress (Balakrishna Pillai)]] under [[R. Balakrishna Pillai]], and [[Kerala Congress (Jacob)]] under [[Johnny Nellore]].

M. George. R. Balakrishna Pillai was another founding leader of the party. Besides these two leaders  Karingozhakkal Mani Mani, popularly called K.M. Mani and P. J. Joseph, the youth front leader rose as prominent leaders of the party. After the death of K. M. George in 1976, there was tussle for control over the party between Balakrishna Pillai and K. M Mani. Pillai felt, as the senior most leader, he would be the de facto leader of the party. However Mani and Joseph had more followers. In the year 1977, just before the Assembly elections, R. Balakrishna Pillai announced a split from the parent Kerala Congress. This group came to be known as [[Kerala Congress (Balakrishna Pillai)]] with R. Balakrishna Pillai as the Chairman. In the Assembly elections of 1977 Kerala Congress stayed with [[United Democratic Front (Kerala)|UDF]] and secured 20 seats where as Pillai group secured 2 seats with [[Left Democratic Front (Kerala)|LDF]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=1977 KC and Pilla Group|url=http://kerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3776:history-of-kerala-legislature|title=History of Kerala Legislature|website=Kerala.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101549/http://kerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3776%3Ahistory-of-kerala-legislature|archivedate=2014-10-06}}</ref>\n\n====1979 Split - Kerala Congress (M)====\nKerala Congress was again split in the year 1979, when veteran Indian politician and the then Minister of Home Affairs in the Kerala government, Karingozhakkal Mani Mani, popularly called K.M. Mani, announced a split from the parent Kerala Congress, owing to difference of opinions with [[P. J. Joseph]]. This group came to be known as Kerala Congress (M) with [[K. M. Mani]] as the Chairman. In the 1979 Panchayat elections Kerala Congress (M) stayed with U. D. F. and Kerala Congress under P. J. Joseph stayed with L. D. F. In 1980 Assembly elections both factions switched the sides. Kerala Congress (M) moved over to L. D. F. along with Congress Leader A. K. Antony and Kerala Congress under P. J. Joseph moved over to U. D. F. Later Kerala Congress (M) returned to the U. D. F. All three factions represented the U. D. F. in 1982 Assembly lections as separate entities. In the 1982 U. D. F government, K. M Mani (Finance), P. J. Joseph (Revenue), R. Balakrishna Pilai (Transport), T. M. Jacob ( Education) became ministers.\n\n====1985 Merger - Kerala Congress====\nIn 1985 the Kerala Congress (M) and [[Kerala Congress (Balakrishna Pillai)]] merged with its parent Kerala Congress under P. J. Joseph while the two factions realized that the splits are indeed weakening the party. The merged Kerala Congress had 25 MLAs and 4 Ministers. On 25 May 1985, at a public meeting at Ernakulam, R Balakrishna Pllai, then a Minister in the Kerala Cabinet, allegedly incited the people to resort to protests like 'Punjab Model' to get the rights of Kerala State. This became a huge controversy and Pillai was forced to resign from the Cabinet and his portfolio was given to K. M Mani. Later the High Court of Kerala gave relief to Pillai. On this grounds the Kerala Congress under Chairman P. J. Joseph requested the then Chief Minister K. Karunakaran to reindic Pillai to the cabinet. Karunakaran saw this as an opportunity to weaken Kerala Congress and took a stand that for Pillai to be re-indicted to the cabinet Kerala Congress has to surrender the Finance portfolio held by Mani or be content with 3 minister ships. This caused Mani to be upset and following a sequence of events, the seeds of another split was already sown.\n\n====1987 Split - Kerala Congress (M)====\nJust before the Assembly elections of 1987 the differences between the factions under K. M Mani and P. J. Joseph got wider following the 'Punjab Model' speech issue. The Kerala Congress was again split when Mani famously declared 'If it is a split, So be it'. The faction under [[K. M. Mani]] was again known as Kerala Congress (M). Pillai and Joseph remained as Kerala Congress. T. M Jacob choose to stay with K. M Mani. In general there was a discontent among the Kerala Congress leaders that K. M. Mani was not putting the interests of the party, but a large number of ordinary party men stayed with Mani. A lot of Mani's earlier loyal leadership team including the leaders who were initially chosen by Mani to negotiate with Joseph, like O. Lukose and P. C. Joseph had to finally align with Joseph in the political situation that unfolded. However K. M. Mani still commanded a lot of loyalty in ordinary party men who were unaware of the insider information.\n\n====1993 Split - Kerala Congress (Jacob)====\nOn 16 December 1993, then Irrigation Affairs Minister [[T. M. Jacob]] MLA along with Johny Nellore MLA, P. M. Mathew MLA, Mathew Stephen MLA, Oommen Mathew, Vakkanad Radhakrishnan, and George Kunnappuzha split from Kerala Congress (M)citing differences with [[K. M. Mani]]. The newly formed faction was called Kerala Congress (Jacob).\n\n====Late 2000 splits and mergers - Kerala Congress (Secular) and IFDP====\nP. C. Thomas, son of [[P. T. Chacko]] who was part of Kerala Congress (M) and was the sitting M.P from Muvattupuzha had growing differences with [[K. M. Mani]]. This caused a split of a group of leaders from Kerala Congress (M) to form Indian Federal Democratic Party (I.F.D.P). IFDP tried to form a national level alliance but failed. Meanwhile, the parent Kerala Congress under [[P. J. Joseph]] also got split when [[P. C. George]] formed the Kerala Congress (Secular) splitting away from parent Kerala Congress under [[P. J. Joseph]].\n\nLater [[Indian Federal Democratic Party]] (I.F.D.P), under [[P. C. Thomas]] which split from the Mani group, merged with the Joseph group. A section of the Indian Federal Democratic Party under M. P. George retains its own cadre. In October 2009, [[Kerala Congress (Secular)]] under [[P. C. George]], which split from the [[Kerala Congress (Joseph)|Joseph group]], merged with the [[Kerala Congress (M)|Mani group]]. A section of the [[Kerala Congress (Secular)]] denied the merger and began to be known as Kerala Congress (Socialist). Kerala Congress Socialist soon got dissolved when it merged with the [[Janata Dal (Secular)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2010040161620500.htm&date=2010/04/01/&prd=th& |title=Kerala Congress (Socialist) to merge with Janata Dal (S) faction |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2010-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125705/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2010040161620500.htm&date=2010%2F04%2F01%2F&prd=th& |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Moves for United Kerala Congress====\nThere were several unofficial moves for bringing back the various splinter groups together under one umbrella ever since the first split of 1979.

The \u2018\u2018copyright\u2019\u2019 for this name is reserved to the prophet Micah, who incorporated it into his famous admonitory prophecy: \u2018\u2018Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest\u2019\u2019 (Micah 3:12). It is quite doubtful, however, that the book of Micah preserved a concrete name that was actually used in the day-to-day lexicon of the prophet\u2019s generation. A close-reading of this passage shows that the phrase \u2018\u2018Mountain of the House\u2019\u2019 is a literary variation of a longer term, the \u2018\u2018mountain of the House of the Lord\u2019\u2019 (three words in Hebrew), which appears in verse 4:1. The author places the complete term in the middle and \u2018\u2018plays\u2019\u2019 with its constituent parts (both pieces come out to two words in Hebrew) in the previous and subsequent verses (3:12; 4:2). In verse 4:1 the name Lord is deleted, leaving the term \u2018\u2018Mount of the House,\u2019\u2019 or Temple Mount. This, then, is not a case of terms taken from the vocabulary of daily life but rather variations characteristic of the common literary diction used by the prophets. Furthermore, nearly one thousand years will pass from the alleged time of Micah until the specific term \u2018\u2018Temple Mount\u2019\u2019 reappears in the Mishnah. In the interim, the term \u2018\u2018Temple Mount\u2019\u2019 is not used in even one of the numerous existing sources, except in works quoting and using the entire phrase from Micah. This is conclusive evidence that the name \u2018\u2018Temple Mount\u2019\u2019 was not used in earlier periods, even though the image of a mountain as a place for a temple was both known and probably, at least to some degree, widespread.\"}}{{sfn|Eliav|2008|p=54|ps=: \"The name \u2018\u2018Temple Mount\u2019\u2019 appears but once throughout the multitude of available sources (in 1 Maccabees, which will be discussed below). Even there, it operates only as a literary construction, inspired by the biblical verse in Micah. This is a decisive finding, which proves that the term \u2018\u2018Temple Mount\u2019\u2019 was not an integral part of the Second Temple period\u2019s lexicon.\"}} The term was not used in the [[New Testament]].{{sfn|Eliav|2008|p=56|ps=: \"Various passages of the New Testament use the images of the Temple and Jerusalem, whether to express the \u2018\u2018Heavenly Jerusalem\u2019\u2019 or, on occasion, as a label for the actual community.

The word combination \u2018\u2018Temple\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Mount\u2019\u2019 is never to be found throughout the entire corpus of the New Testament.\"}} The term was used next in the [[Middot (Talmud)|Talmud's Tractate Middot]] (1:1\u20133, 2:1\u20132), in which the area was described in detail.{{sfn|Eliav|2008|p=59|ps=: \"Tractate Middot (1:1\u20133, 2:1\u20132) of the Mishnah, one of the earliest texts of this literature, represents the Mount as a recognized territorial constituent within the Temple complex.

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Temple Mount was originally a [[threshing-floor]] owned by [[Araunah]], a [[Jebusite]].

Evidence of a Hasmonean expansion of the Temple Mount has been recovered by archaeologist [[Leen Ritmeyer]].

The Mamluk-period substructures and over-ground buildings are thus covering much of the Herodian western wall of the Temple Mount.\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n\nFollowing the Ottoman conquest of Palestine in 1516, the Ottoman authorities continued the policy of prohibiting non-Muslims from setting foot on the Temple Mount until the early 19th century, when non-Muslims were again permitted to visit the site.<ref name=MeyerMessner/>\n\nIn 1867, a team from the [[Royal Engineers]], led by Lieutenant [[Charles Warren]] and financed by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] (P.E.F.), discovered a series of tunnels near the Temple Mount.

Some Jews, led by [[Shlomo Goren]], then the military chief rabbi, had objected as well, claiming the decision handed over the complex to the Muslims, since the Western Wall's holiness is derived from the Mount and symbolizes exile, while praying on the Mount symbolizes freedom and the return of the Jewish people to their homeland.<ref name=Gonen /> The President of the High Court of Justice, [[Aharon Barak]], in response to an appeal in 1976 against police interference with an individual's putative right to prayer on the site, expressed the view that, while Jews had a right to prayer there, it was not absolute but subject to the public interest and the rights of other groups. Israel's courts have considered the issue as one beyond their remit, and, given the delicacy of the matter, under political jurisdiction.<ref name=Gonen/> He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The basic principle is that every Jew has the right to enter the Temple Mount, to pray there, and to have communion with his maker. This is part of the religious freedom of worship, it is part of the freedom of expression. However, as with every human right, it is not absolute, but a relative right... Indeed, in a case where there is near certainty that injury may be caused to the public interest if a person's rights of religious worship and freedom of expression would be realized, it is possible to limit the rights of the person in order to uphold the public interest.<ref name=Gonen/></blockquote>\n\nPolice continued to forbid Jews to pray on the Temple Mount.<ref name=Gonen/> Subsequently, several prime ministers also made attempts to change the status quo, but failed to do so. In October 1986, an agreement between the [[Temple Mount Faithful]], the Supreme Muslim Council and police, which would allow short visits in small groups, was exercised once and never repeated, after 2,000 Muslims armed with stones and bottles attacked the group and stoned worshipers at the Western Wall.

The Israeli police had never entered al-Aqsa Mosque until November 5, 2014, when dialog with the leaders of the Waqf and the rioters failed.

In the western face, near the southern corner, is the Barclay's Gate \u2013 only half visible due to a building (the \"house of Abu Sa'ud\") on the northern side. Also in the western face, hidden by later construction but visible via the recent [[Western Wall Tunnels]], and only rediscovered by Warren, is [[Warren's Gate]]; the function of these western gates is obscure, but many Jews view Warren's Gate as particularly holy, due to its location due west of the Dome of the Rock. Traditional belief considers the Dome of the Rock to have earlier been the location at which the [[Holy of Holies]] was placed; numerous alternative opinions exist, based on study and calculations, such as those of Tuvia Sagiv.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templemount.org/sagiv2/index.html|title=Determination of the location of the Temple based on the angle of sight of Agrippa II|work=templemount.org}}</ref>\n\nWarren was able to investigate the inside of these gates.

The earth from this operation, which has archeological wealth relevant to Jewish, Christian and Muslim history, was removed by heavy machinery and unceremoniously dumped by trucks into the nearby Kidron Valley. Although the archeological finds in the earth are already not [[in situ]], this soil still contains great archeological potential. No archeological excavation was ever conducted on the Temple Mount, and this soil was the only archeological information that has ever been available to anyone. For this reason Israeli archaeologists Dr. [[Gabriel Barkay]] and [[Zachi Zweig]] established a project sifting all the earth in this dump: the [[Temple Mount Sifting Project]].\nAmong finds uncovered in rubble removed from the Temple Mount were:\n* The imprint of a seal thought to have belonged to a priestly Jewish family mentioned in the Old Testament's Book of Jeremiah.\n* More than 4300 coins from various periods. Many of them are from the Jewish revolt that preceded the destruction of the Second Temple by Roman legions in 70 CE emblazoned with the words \"Freedom of Zion\"\n* Arrowheads shot by Babylonian archers 2,500 years ago, and others launched by Roman siege machinery 500 years later.\n* Unique floor slabs of the '[[opus sectile]]' technique that were used to pave the Temple Mount courts.

The \u2018\u2018copyright\u2019\u2019 for this name is reserved to the prophet Micah, who incorporated it into his famous admonitory prophecy: \u2018\u2018Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest\u2019\u2019 (Micah 3:12). It is quite doubtful, however, that the book of Micah preserved a concrete name that was actually used in the day-to-day lexicon of the prophet\u2019s generation. A close-reading of this passage shows that the phrase \u2018\u2018Mountain of the House\u2019\u2019 is a literary variation of a longer term, the \u2018\u2018mountain of the House of the Lord\u2019\u2019 (three words in Hebrew), which appears in verse 4:1. The author places the complete term in the middle and \u2018\u2018plays\u2019\u2019 with its constituent parts (both pieces come out to two words in Hebrew) in the previous and subsequent verses (3:12; 4:2). In verse 4:1 the name Lord is deleted, leaving the term \u2018\u2018Mount of the House,\u2019\u2019 or Temple Mount. This, then, is not a case of terms taken from the vocabulary of daily life but rather variations characteristic of the common literary diction used by the prophets. Furthermore, nearly one thousand years will pass from the alleged time of Micah until the specific term \u2018\u2018Temple Mount\u2019\u2019 reappears in the Mishnah. In the interim, the term \u2018\u2018Temple Mount\u2019\u2019 is not used in even one of the numerous existing sources, except in works quoting and using the entire phrase from Micah. This is conclusive evidence that the name \u2018\u2018Temple Mount\u2019\u2019 was not used in earlier periods, even though the image of a mountain as a place for a temple was both known and probably, at least to some degree, widespread.\"}}{{sfn|Eliav|2008|p=54|ps=: \"The name \u2018\u2018Temple Mount\u2019\u2019 appears but once throughout the multitude of available sources (in 1 Maccabees, which will be discussed below). Even there, it operates only as a literary construction, inspired by the biblical verse in Micah. This is a decisive finding, which proves that the term \u2018\u2018Temple Mount\u2019\u2019 was not an integral part of the Second Temple period\u2019s lexicon.\"}} The term was not used in the [[New Testament]].{{sfn|Eliav|2008|p=56|ps=: \"Various passages of the New Testament use the images of the Temple and Jerusalem, whether to express the \u2018\u2018Heavenly Jerusalem\u2019\u2019 or, on occasion, as a label for the actual community.

The word combination \u2018\u2018Temple\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Mount\u2019\u2019 is never to be found throughout the entire corpus of the New Testament.\"}} The term was used next in the [[Middot (Talmud)|Talmud's Tractate Middot]] (1:1\u20133, 2:1\u20132), in which the area was described in detail.{{sfn|Eliav|2008|p=59|ps=: \"Tractate Middot (1:1\u20133, 2:1\u20132) of the Mishnah, one of the earliest texts of this literature, represents the Mount as a recognized territorial constituent within the Temple complex.

The Mamluks also raised the level of Jerusalem's Central or Tyropoean Valey bordering the Temple Mount from the west by constructing huge substructures, on which they then built on a large scale. The Mamluk-period substructures and over-ground buildings are thus covering much of the Herodian western wall of the Temple Mount.\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n\nFollowing the Ottoman conquest of Palestine in 1516, the Ottoman authorities continued the policy of prohibiting non-Muslims from setting foot on the Temple Mount until the early 19th century, when non-Muslims were again permitted to visit the site.<ref name=MeyerMessner/>\n\nIn 1867, a team from the [[Royal Engineers]], led by Lieutenant [[Charles Warren]] and financed by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] (P.E.F.), discovered a series of tunnels near the Temple Mount.

Some Jews, led by [[Shlomo Goren]], then the military chief rabbi, had objected as well, claiming the decision handed over the complex to the Muslims, since the Western Wall's holiness is derived from the Mount and symbolizes exile, while praying on the Mount symbolizes freedom and the return of the Jewish people to their homeland.<ref name=Gonen /> The President of the High Court of Justice, [[Aharon Barak]], in response to an appeal in 1976 against police interference with an individual's putative right to prayer on the site, expressed the view that, while Jews had a right to prayer there, it was not absolute but subject to the public interest and the rights of other groups. Israel's courts have considered the issue as one beyond their remit, and, given the delicacy of the matter, under political jurisdiction.<ref name=Gonen/> He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The basic principle is that every Jew has the right to enter the Temple Mount, to pray there, and to have communion with his maker. This is part of the religious freedom of worship, it is part of the freedom of expression. However, as with every human right, it is not absolute, but a relative right... Indeed, in a case where there is near certainty that injury may be caused to the public interest if a person's rights of religious worship and freedom of expression would be realized, it is possible to limit the rights of the person in order to uphold the public interest.<ref name=Gonen/></blockquote>\n\nPolice continued to forbid Jews to pray on the Temple Mount.<ref name=Gonen/> Subsequently, several prime ministers also made attempts to change the status quo, but failed to do so. In October 1986, an agreement between the [[Temple Mount Faithful]], the Supreme Muslim Council and police, which would allow short visits in small groups, was exercised once and never repeated, after 2,000 Muslims armed with stones and bottles attacked the group and stoned worshipers at the Western Wall.

The Israeli police had never entered al-Aqsa Mosque until November 5, 2014, when dialog with the leaders of the Waqf and the rioters failed.

Despite the currently narrow entrances, this cistern (17 and 16 are the same cistern) is a large vaulted chamber, which Warren described as looking like the inside of the cathedral at [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] (which was previously a mosque). Warren believed that it was almost certainly built for some other purpose, and was only adapted into a cistern at a later date; he suggested that it might have been part of a general vault supporting the northern side of the platform, in which case substantially more of the chamber exists than is used for a cistern.\n\n=== Gates ===\n{{Main|Gates of the Temple Mount}}\n[[File:Hulda gates.jpg|thumb|200px|The eastern set of Hulda gates]]\n[[File:RobinsonsArchMay2009.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Robinson's Arch]], situated on the southwestern flank, once supported a staircase that led to the Mount.]]\n:'''Sealed gates'''\nThe retaining walls of the platform contain several gateways, all currently blocked. In the eastern wall is [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|the Golden Gate]], through which legend states the [[Jewish Messiah]] would enter Jerusalem. On the southern face are the [[Hulda Gates]] \u2014 the ''triple gate'' (which has three arches) and the ''double gate'' (which has two arches, and is partly obscured by a Crusader building); these were the entrance and exit (respectively) to the Temple Mount from [[Ophel]] (the oldest part of Jerusalem), and the main access to the Mount for ordinary Jews. In the western face, near the southern corner, is the Barclay's Gate \u2013 only half visible due to a building (the \"house of Abu Sa'ud\") on the northern side. Also in the western face, hidden by later construction but visible via the recent [[Western Wall Tunnels]], and only rediscovered by Warren, is [[Warren's Gate]]; the function of these western gates is obscure, but many Jews view Warren's Gate as particularly holy, due to its location due west of the Dome of the Rock. Traditional belief considers the Dome of the Rock to have earlier been the location at which the [[Holy of Holies]] was placed; numerous alternative opinions exist, based on study and calculations, such as those of Tuvia Sagiv.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templemount.org/sagiv2/index.html|title=Determination of the location of the Temple based on the angle of sight of Agrippa II|work=templemount.org}}</ref>\n\nWarren was able to investigate the inside of these gates. Warren's Gate and the Golden Gate simply head towards the centre of the Mount, fairly quickly giving access to the surface by steps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campsci.com/museum/images/38g.jpg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020719154856/http://campsci.com/museum/images/38g.jpg |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-07-19 |title=Photograph of the inside of the Golden Gate |accessdate=2018-04-05}}</ref> Barclay's Gate is similar, but abruptly turns south as it does so; the reason for this is currently unknown.

the eastern aisle of the double gates and western of the triple gates reach the surface, the other aisles terminating some way before the steps \u2013 Warren believed that one aisle of each original passage was extended when the al-Aqsa Mosque blocked the original surface exits.\n\nIn the process of investigating Cistern 10, Warren discovered tunnels that lay ''under'' the Triple Gate passageway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campsci.com/museum/images/47a.jpg |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020719033733/http://campsci.com/museum/images/47a.jpg |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-07-19 |title=Photograph of one of the chambers ''under'' the Triple Gate passageway |accessdate=2018-04-05}}</ref> These passages lead in erratic directions, some leading beyond the southern edge of the Temple Mount (they are at a depth below the base of the walls); their purpose is currently unknown \u2013 as is whether they predate the Temple Mount \u2013 a situation not helped by the fact that apart from Warren's expedition no one else is known to have visited them.\n\nAltogether, there are six major sealed gates and a postern, listed here counterclockwise, dating from either the Roman/Herodian, Byzantine, or Early Muslim periods:\n* Bab al-Jana'iz/al-Buraq (Gate of the Funerals/of al-Buraq);

The earth from this operation, which has archeological wealth relevant to Jewish, Christian and Muslim history, was removed by heavy machinery and unceremoniously dumped by trucks into the nearby Kidron Valley. Although the archeological finds in the earth are already not [[in situ]], this soil still contains great archeological potential. No archeological excavation was ever conducted on the Temple Mount, and this soil was the only archeological information that has ever been available to anyone.
