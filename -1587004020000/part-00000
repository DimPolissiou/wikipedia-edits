The names of 24 states derive from [[indigenous languages of the Americas]] and one from [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]: eight come from [[Algonquian languages]], seven from [[Siouan languages]] (one of those by way of [[Miami-Illinois language|Illinois]], an Algonquian language), three from [[Iroquoian languages]], one from a [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language]], and five from other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] languages.\n\nTwenty-two other state names derive from European languages: seven come from [[Latin]] (mostly from Latinate forms of English personal names, one coming from [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), five from [[English language|English]], five from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (and one more from an Indigenous language by way of Spanish), and four from [[French language|French]] (one of these by way of English). The etymologies of six states are disputed or unclear: Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Oregon, and Rhode Island (in the table below, those states have one row for each potential source language or meaning).\n\nOf the fifty states, eleven are [[Eponym|named after an individual person]]. Of those eleven, seven are named in honor of European monarchs: [[the Carolinas|the two Carolinas]], [[the Virginias|the two Virginias]], Maryland, Louisiana, and Georgia. Over the years, several attempts have been made to name a state after one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] or other great statesmen of U.S. history: the [[State of Franklin]], the [[Jefferson State (disambiguation)|State of Jefferson]] (three separate attempts), the [[State of Lincoln (disambiguation)|State of Lincoln]] (two separate attempts), and the [[State of Washington]]; in the end, only Washington materialized ([[Washington Territory]] was carved out of the [[Columbia District]], and was [[geographical renaming|renamed]] Washington in order to avoid confusion with the [[District of Columbia]], which contains the city of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]).<ref name=\"Longview History\">{{cite web | title = City of Longview History | publisher = City of Longview, WA | url = http://www.mylongview.com/index.aspx?page=52 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140120081847/http://mylongview.com/index.aspx?page=52 | url-status = dead | archive-date = January 20, 2014 | accessdate = April 17, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"Cowlitz Timeline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.wa.gov/history/Timeline/detail.aspx?id=205 |title=Settlers met at Cowlitz Landing and discussed the establishment of a new territory north of the Columbia River |work=Washington History \u2013 Territorial Timeline |publisher=Washington Secretary of State |accessdate=February 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of the states that derive their names from (corrupted) [[ethnonym|names used for Native peoples]] have retained the plural ending of \"s\": Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, and Texas.

The names of 24 states derive from [[indigenous languages of the Americas]] and one from [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]: eight come from [[Algonquian languages]], seven from [[Siouan languages]] (one of those by way of [[Miami-Illinois language|Illinois]], an Algonquian language), three from [[Iroquoian languages]], one from a [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language]], and five from other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] languages.\n\nTwenty-two other state names derive from European languages: seven come from [[Latin]] (mostly from Latinate forms of English personal names, one coming from [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), five from [[English language|English]], five from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (and one more from an Indigenous language by way of Spanish), and four from [[French language|French]] (one of these by way of English). The etymologies of six states are disputed or unclear: Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Oregon, and Rhode Island (in the table below, those states have one row for each potential source language or meaning).\n\nOf the fifty states, eleven are [[Eponym|named after an individual person]]. Of those eleven, seven are named in honor of European monarchs: [[the Carolinas|the two Carolinas]], [[the Virginias|the two Virginias]], Maryland, Louisiana, and Georgia. Over the years, several attempts have been made to name a state after one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] or other great statesmen of U.S. history: the [[State of Franklin]], the [[Jefferson State (disambiguation)|State of Jefferson]] (three separate attempts), the [[State of Lincoln (disambiguation)|State of Lincoln]] (two separate attempts), and the [[State of Washington]]; in the end, only Washington materialized ([[Washington Territory]] was carved out of the [[Columbia District]], and was [[geographical renaming|renamed]] Washington in order to avoid confusion with the [[District of Columbia]], which contains the city of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]).<ref name=\"Longview History\">{{cite web | title = City of Longview History | publisher = City of Longview, WA | url = http://www.mylongview.com/index.aspx?page=52 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140120081847/http://mylongview.com/index.aspx?page=52 | url-status = dead | archive-date = January 20, 2014 | accessdate = April 17, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"Cowlitz Timeline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.wa.gov/history/Timeline/detail.aspx?id=205 |title=Settlers met at Cowlitz Landing and discussed the establishment of a new territory north of the Columbia River |work=Washington History \u2013 Territorial Timeline |publisher=Washington Secretary of State |accessdate=February 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of the states that derive their names from (corrupted) [[ethnonym|names used for Native peoples]] have retained the plural ending of \"s\": Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, and Texas.

This marked the first time since 1985 that a new church president had not retained a previously-serving counselor.\n\n==== Worldwide ministry ====\nSince becoming President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Nelson has visited Latter-day Saints in various areas of the world. Up through August 2019, he had visited sixteen countries, addressing thousands of members of the faith.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Scott |title=President Nelson Traveled to 16 Nations and Territories during First Year as Prophet |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/president-nelson-traveled-to-16-nations-and-territories-during-first-year-as-prophet?lang=eng |accessdate=18 August 2019 |agency=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}</ref>\n\nThe first trip, called a global ministry tour by the church, occurred in April 2018, when Nelson along with his wife, and [[Jeffrey R.

Nelson began his presidency two days after his ordination with a short broadcast to church members in January 2018 before then holding a press conference.  This broadcast ahead of the press conference was unprecedented and provided the new leaders an opportunity to briefly address the entire church immediately.<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/2018/04/as-we-go-forward-together?lang=eng report on Nelson's broadcast to the Church]</ref> \n\nIn March 2018, the First Presidency issued a letter on preventing and responding to abuse. This letter reiterated existing policies, but also explicitly stated that no one should ever be counseled against reporting abuse to legal authorities. The guidance also had a clear emphasis on using counseling to assist in healing from abuse. It also provided more clear policies mandating all interviews with women and youth be done with another person in the general area, and made it clear that youth and women could have a parent or other adult present for an interview. It also adjusted previous policies forbidding adult males to teach classes of children or youth alone to apply to all adults.<ref>[https://www.newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/first-presidency-encourages-leaders-worldwide-prevent-respond-abuse report on March first presidency letter]</ref>\n\nDuring the church's April general conference, Nelson announced the appointment of Asian-American [[Gerrit W. Gong]] and Brazilian [[Ulisses Soares]] to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, both of whom had been serving in the [[Seventy (LDS Church)#Presidency of the Seventy|Presidency of the Seventy]]. By most measures, Gong was the first apostle who was not white, although some also consider Soares as non-white. These calls were recognized as adding diversity to the Quorum of the Twelve.<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900014460/twitter-reacts-to-lds-church-naming-new-apostles-elder-gong-and-elder-soares.html article about new apostles]</ref> \n\nNelson also announced major changes in church organization during the April general conference. First, the high priests groups at the ward level were dissolved, making all Melchizedek Priesthood holders in wards and branches part of the elders quorum.  A stake's high priest quorum now consists of current members of stake presidencies, high councils, bishoprics and functioning patriarchs. Next, Nelson announced the end of home teaching and visiting teaching, replacing the programs with a focus on ministering, and shifting both the focus and methods of tracking them. As part of this change, young women ages 14-18 may be assigned as ministering sisters, similar to the-long standing policies of young men ages 14-18 serving as home teachers.<ref>[https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/04/01/the-latest-from-final-day-of-mormon-general-conference-easter-greetings-plea-to-be-worthy-of-gods-guidance/ article on announcements at general conference]</ref> At the end of the conference Nelson announced the construction of seven new temples, including the first in Nicaragua, Russia, India, and the US state of Virginia.\n\nIn May 2018, the church announced it would end its sponsorship of scouting troops at the end of 2019. As part of this decision, it was stated that all Young Men, Young Women, and Primary programs for those age 8-18 would be replaced by a new, unified worldwide program.<ref>[https://www.sltrib.com/news/2018/05/09/mormon-church-to-cut-ties-with-boy-scouts-and-start-its-own-gospel-driven-youth-program/ article on LDS Church ending scouting, announcing new youth program]</ref>\n\nJune 2018 began with a First Presidency-sponsored celebration of the 40th anniversary of the revelation extending [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] and [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] blessing to all worthy members without regard to race, in which Nelson gave concluding remarks.<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900020359/church-news-president-nelsons-full-remarks-from-the-lds-churchs-be-one-celebration.html article on Nelson's statement at meeting]</ref> A few days before this, Nelson and his counselors met with the national leaders of the [[NAACP]].<ref>[http://fox13now.com/2018/05/17/watch-live-lds-church-first-presidency-and-naacp-making-joint-statement/ article on Nelson meeting with NAACP leadership]</ref> That same weekend Nelson gave a devotional to Latter-day Saint youth in which he urged them to more fully commit to the church.

His travels have been punctuated by several temple dedications, most notably the [[Rome Italy Temple]] in March 2019, which was attended by all current members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nIn 2018, Nelson announced 19 new temples, 7 in April and 12 in October, among which were the first in [[India]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Russia]], and [[Cambodia]].

Nelson began his presidency two days after his ordination with a short broadcast to church members in January 2018 before then holding a press conference.  This broadcast ahead of the press conference was unprecedented and provided the new leaders an opportunity to briefly address the entire church immediately.<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/2018/04/as-we-go-forward-together?lang=eng report on Nelson's broadcast to the Church]</ref> \n\nIn March 2018, the First Presidency issued a letter on preventing and responding to abuse. This letter reiterated existing policies, but also explicitly stated that no one should ever be counseled against reporting abuse to legal authorities. The guidance also had a clear emphasis on using counseling to assist in healing from abuse. It also provided more clear policies mandating all interviews with women and youth be done with another person in the general area, and made it clear that youth and women could have a parent or other adult present for an interview. It also adjusted previous policies forbidding adult males to teach classes of children or youth alone to apply to all adults.<ref>[https://www.newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/first-presidency-encourages-leaders-worldwide-prevent-respond-abuse report on March first presidency letter]</ref>\n\nDuring the church's April general conference, Nelson announced the appointment of Asian-American [[Gerrit W. Gong]] and Brazilian [[Ulisses Soares]] to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, both of whom had been serving in the [[Seventy (LDS Church)#Presidency of the Seventy|Presidency of the Seventy]]. By most measures, Gong was the first apostle who was not white, although some also consider Soares as non-white. These calls were recognized as adding diversity to the Quorum of the Twelve.<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900014460/twitter-reacts-to-lds-church-naming-new-apostles-elder-gong-and-elder-soares.html article about new apostles]</ref> \n\nNelson also announced major changes in church organization during the April general conference. First, the high priests groups at the ward level were dissolved, making all Melchizedek Priesthood holders in wards and branches part of the elders quorum.  A stake's high priest quorum now consists of current members of stake presidencies, high councils, bishoprics and functioning patriarchs. Next, Nelson announced the end of home teaching and visiting teaching, replacing the programs with a focus on ministering, and shifting both the focus and methods of tracking them. As part of this change, young women ages 14-18 may be assigned as ministering sisters, similar to the-long standing policies of young men ages 14-18 serving as home teachers.<ref>[https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/04/01/the-latest-from-final-day-of-mormon-general-conference-easter-greetings-plea-to-be-worthy-of-gods-guidance/ article on announcements at general conference]</ref> At the end of the conference Nelson announced the construction of seven new temples, including the first in Nicaragua, Russia, India, and the US state of Virginia.\n\nIn May 2018, the church announced it would end its sponsorship of scouting troops at the end of 2019.

As of October 2019, Nelson has announced a total of 35 new temples to be built in several countries around the world. His travels have been punctuated by several temple dedications, most notably the [[Rome Italy Temple]] in March 2019, which was attended by all current members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nIn 2018, Nelson announced 19 new temples, 7 in April and 12 in October, among which were the first in [[India]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Russia]], and [[Cambodia]]. During his April 2018 visit to India, Nelson explained to church members that the Lord had instructed him to announce the temple the night before general conference, though he had not originally planned to do so.<ref>[https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900016345/in-india-the-story-of-the-india-temple-announcement-is-revealed.html In India, the story of the India LDS Temple Announcement Is Revelaed], ''[[Deseret News]]'', 19 April 2018.
