Indoor tanning is already used by many people as a treatment for psoriasis; one indoor facility reported that 50% of its clients were using the center for psoriasis treatment; another reported 36% were doing the same thing. However, a concern with the use of commercial tanning is that tanning beds that primarily emit UVA might not effectively treat psoriasis.

Indoor tanning resources are almost ubiquitous today and could be considered as a means for people to get UV exposure when dermatologist provided phototherapy is not available. Indoor tanning is already used by many people as a treatment for psoriasis; one indoor facility reported that 50% of its clients were using the center for psoriasis treatment; another reported 36% were doing the same thing. However, a concern with the use of commercial tanning is that tanning beds that primarily emit UVA might not effectively treat psoriasis. One study found that plaque psoriasis is responsive to [[erythema|erythemogenic]] doses of either UVA or UVB, as exposure to either can cause dissipation of psoriatic plaques. It does require more energy to reach erythemogenic dosing with UVA.<ref name=\"radack\">{{cite journal|last1=Radack|first1=KP|last2=Farhangian|first2=ME|last3=Anderson|first3=KL|last4=Feldman|first4=SR|title=A review of the use of tanning beds as a dermatological treatment|journal=Dermatology and Therapy|date=March 2015|volume=5|issue=1|pages=37\u201351|doi=10.1007/s13555-015-0071-8|pmid=25735439|pmc=4374067}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Risks of UV light therapy -->\nUV light therapies all have risks; tanning beds are no exception, being listed by the [[World Health Organization]] as carcinogens.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors=((World Health Organization)) | title=Artificial tanning devices: public health interventions to manage sunbeds | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | date=15 June 2017 | hdl=10665/255695 | isbn=9789241512596 }}</ref> Exposure to UV light is known to increase the risks of melanoma, squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas; younger people with psoriasis, particularly those under age 35, are at increased risk from melanoma from UV light treatment.

The school's mascot is Sammy the Spartan or Sammy Spartan for short.\n\nAfter 1887, the official name of the San Jose campus was the State Normal School at San Jose. The school's athletic teams initially played under the \"Normal\" identity, but they gradually shifted to the State Normal School identity, as evidenced by images of the SNS football and basketball squads from this era. Despite the SNS identity, the school continued to be referred to as the California State Normal School, San Jose in official publications.

At a projected cost of $139 million, the new facility will house a gymnasium, weight and fitness center, exercise rooms, rock climbing wall, sports club organizations, and competition and recreation pools with support spaces. The new facility will be located on the main campus at the corner of 7th Street and San Carlos close to the existing aquatic and student recreation centers.

SJSU has participated in athletics since it first fielded a [[baseball]] team in 1890.\n\nSan Jos\u00e9 State University sports teams have won NCAA national titles in [[track and field]], cross country, [[golf]], [[boxing]], [[fencing]] and [[tennis]].<ref name=\"fs.ncaa.org\">{{cite web |url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/champs_records_book/Overall.pdf |title=Championships History (through July 2, 2014) |page=10 |publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association}}</ref> As of 2018, SJSU has won 10 NCAA national Division 1 team championships<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/champs_records_book/Overall.pdf |title=Championships History (through January 10, 2014) |page=5 |publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association}}</ref> and produced 50 NCAA national Division 1 individual champions.<ref name=\"fs.ncaa.org\"/> SJSU also has achieved an international reputation for its judo program, winning 51 National Collegiate Judo Association (NCJA) championships in 56 years (as of 2017).<ref name=\"Rhoden\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/02/sports/san-jose-coach-yoshihiro-uchida-a-force-for-judo.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=William C. | last=Rhoden | title=Yoshihiro Uchida Has Coached Judo for 66 Years at San Jose St | date=April 1, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"ncjajudo.org\">http://www.ncjajudo.org/#!results/c3zb</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncjajudo.org/#!results/c3zb|title=ncja|work=ncja|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref><ref>http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/04/02/nearly-a-century-old-yoshihiro-uchida-still-wows-olympians/</ref><ref>https://www.ncjajudo.org</ref>\n\nSJSU alumni have won 19 Olympic medals (including seven gold medals) dating back to the first gold medal won by [[Willie Steele]] in track and field in the 1948 Olympics.

Smith and Carlos are perhaps best remembered for giving the [[raised fist]] salute from the medalist's podium during the 1968 Summer Olympic Games in [[Mexico City]].\n\nSan Jos\u00e9 State University sponsors teams in seven men's and thirteen women's NCAA sanctioned sports:<ref>http://www.sjsuspartans.com/</ref>\n\n==Nickname and mascot history==\nDue to the school's original designation as a teachers' college, SJSU's mascot changed many times before the school finally adopted the Spartans as the official mascot and nickname in 1922.  Mascots and nicknames prior to 1922 included the Daniels, the Teachers, the Pedagogues, the Normals, and the Normalites. The school's mascot is Sammy the Spartan or Sammy Spartan for short.\n\nAfter 1887, the official name of the San Jose campus was the State Normal School at San Jose. The school's athletic teams initially played under the \"Normal\" identity, but they gradually shifted to the State Normal School identity, as evidenced by images of the SNS football and basketball squads from this era. Despite the SNS identity, the school continued to be referred to as the California State Normal School, San Jose in official publications. A 2007 historical exhibit in the [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library|Martin Luther King Library]] on the San Jose State campus featured a number of pieces of State Normal School memorabilia, including an SNS pennant.\n\n==Sports sponsored==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=San Jose State Spartans|Men's sports|Women's sports}}\n|-\n| [[San Jose State Spartans baseball|Baseball]] || [[San Jose State Spartans women's basketball|Basketball]]\n|-\n| [[San Jose State Spartans men's basketball|Basketball]] || Beach volleyball\n|-\n| Cross country || Cross country\n|-\n| [[San Jose State Spartans football|Football]] || Golf\n|-\n| Golf || Gymnastics\n|-\n| Soccer || Soccer\n|-\n| Track and field<sup>\u2020</sup> || Softball\n|-\n| Water polo || Swimming and diving\n|-\n| || Tennis\n|-\n| || Track and field<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|-\n| || Volleyball\n|-\n| || Water polo\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"{{NCAA secondary color cell|San Jose State Spartans}}\" | {{small|\u2020 \u2013 Track and field includes both indoor and outdoor}}\n|}\nAll varsity teams representing San Jos\u00e9 State University compete in the [[Mountain West Conference]] except beach volleyball ([[List of NCAA women's beach volleyball programs|Independent]]), gymnastics and women's water polo ([[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]]), men's soccer ([[Western Athletic Conference]]), and men's water polo ([[Golden Coast Conference]]).\n\n===Baseball===\n{{main|San Jose State Spartans baseball}}\n\n*The Spartan baseball team made NCAA tournament appearances in 1955, 1971, 2000 and 2002.
