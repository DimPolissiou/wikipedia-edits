Before leaving, she visits her mother, Darla, who lives in a mental institution because she suffers from delusions. Upon arriving at the Fairchild Estate, Kate is informed by the caretaker Mrs. Grose that Flora witnessed her parents die in a car accident outside the house's gate and is a \"special case.\" Flora gives Kate a tour of the grounds and confesses that she is afraid Kate will leave her like Miss Jessel did but Kate promises not to. \n\nThat night, Kate investigates a disturbance in the East Wing, which Flora refused to show her earlier. There, she encounters Flora's brother Miles, who is back from boarding school. The next day, Kate receives a call from the school's principal, who informs her that Miles is expelled after having been found strangling another boy. This startles Kate, who only becomes more aggravated with him when he and Flora begin pulling pranks on her. She lashes out at Miles, but later apologizes. Miles suggests he teach her how to ride horses to make it up to her, as their former riding instructor Quint has recently died. \n\nKate notices strange occurrences happening at night, so she begins to keep her lights on when she goes to sleep. One day she suggests they go into town, to the dismay of both Flora and Mrs. Grose. Flora throws a fit and proceeds to run out of the car after Kate refuses to stop it. Miles warns her to leave but Kate decides to stay due to her promise to Flora. \n\nAfter reconciling, the group plays tag in the house. While looking for Miles, Kate is attacked by the ghost of Miss Jessel. She finds Miss Jessel's journal, which contains frightening entries about how Quint was obsessed with her and took pictures of her while she slept. When Kate enquires about it, Mrs. Grose tells her that Quint died a couple weeks following Miss Jessel's departure when he fell from his horse while riding drunk. Kate continues to see Quint and Miss Jessel's ghosts around the house, making her increasingly paranoid. \n\nKate receives art from her mother in the mail, and Mrs. Grose comments that she hopes Kate's mother's condition isn't genetic. She is led by wet footprints and Miss Jessel's ghost to discover Miss Jessel's dead body in a pond on the house grounds. Kate also has a vision of Quint raping and strangling Miss Jessel and tells Mrs. Grose, who appears to have already known about it. Mrs. Grose assures her that she made sure Quint died. Quint's ghost pushes Mrs. Grose over the stair banister, killing her. Kate takes the children away in her car. \n\nThis previous sequence is revealed to have been a vision which Kate had as she heard Mrs. Grose's words and looked at her mother's art. She walks in on the children talking about her and becomes convinced that she sees Quint's ghost in the mirror, insisting that Flora saw him too despite her protests. When Kate accidentally breaks Flora's doll, Miles smirks at her, calling her delusional. Kate walks into her mother's mental institution and approaches a figure that appears to be her mother, Darla; as the figure turns around, Kate screams in horror. The face of the figure is not revealed.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mackenzie Davis]] as Kate Mandell\n* [[Finn Wolfhard]] as Miles Fairchild\n* [[Brooklynn Prince]] as Flora Fairchild\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Darla Mandell<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/pete-davidson-judd-apatow-comedy-the-turning-universal-movie-opening-dates-1202547662/|title=Universal Dates Judd Apatow-Pete Davidson Comedy & DreamWorks' 'The Turning' For 2020|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=February 1, 2019|accessdate=February 1, 2019}}</ref> \n* [[Barbara Marten]] as Mrs. Grose\n* [[Mark Huberman]] as Bert\n* Niall Greig Fulton as Peter Quint\n* Denna Thomsen as Miss Jessel\n* Kim Adis as Rose\n* Karen Egan as Nancy\n* Darlene Garr as Holly\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe film first entered development in March 2016 and was described as a passion project for [[Steven Spielberg]], who executive produced, as he wanted to be involved in a horror film again.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://deadline.com/2016/03/juan-carlos-fresnadillo-haunted-dreamworks-horror-turn-of-the-screw-1201717460/|title=Juan Carlos Fresnadillo To Helm Ghost Tale 'Haunted' For DreamWorks|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|date=March 9, 2016|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The film adaptation went through two phases of production: first as ''Haunted'' with [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]] attached as director, then the ultimate version, renamed as ''The Turning'', with [[Floria Sigismondi]].<ref name=Development>{{Cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dreamworks-shuts-down-ghost-story-931333|title=DreamWorks Shuts Down Ghost Story 'Haunted' Weeks Before Start Date (Exclusive)|last=Masters|first=Kim|date=September 21, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=Development2>{{Cite news| url=http://deadline.com/2017/08/floria-sigismondi-direct-the-turning-amblin-the-turn-of-the-screw-henry-james-1202155351/|title=Floria Sigismondi To Direct Henry James-Inspired 'The Turning' For Amblin|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|date=August 24, 2017|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n====Fresnadillo project (2016)====\nOn March 9, 2016, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that [[Amblin Entertainment]] was hiring Juan Carlos Fresnadillo to direct a film titled ''Haunted'', which would be inspired by [[Henry James]]' 1898 [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] ghost story, ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''.

Before leaving, she visits her mother, who lives in a mental institution because she suffers from delusions. Upon arriving at the Fairchild Estate, Kate is informed by the caretaker Mrs. Grose that Flora witnessed her parents die in a car accident outside the house's gate and is a \"special case.\" Flora gives Kate a tour of the grounds and confesses that she is afraid Kate will leave her like Miss Jessel did but Kate promises not to. \n\nThat night, Kate investigates a disturbance in the East Wing, which Flora refused to show her earlier. There, she encounters Flora's brother Miles, who is back from boarding school. The next day, Kate receives a call from the school's principal, who informs her that Miles is expelled after having been found strangling another boy. This startles Kate, who only becomes more aggravated with him when he and Flora begin pulling pranks on her. She lashes out at Miles, but later apologizes. Miles suggests he teach her how to ride horses to make it up to her, as their former riding instructor Quint has recently died. \n\nKate notices strange occurrences happening at night, so she begins to keep her lights on when she goes to sleep. One day she suggests they go into town, to the dismay of both Flora and Mrs. Grose. Flora throws a fit and proceeds to run out of the car after Kate refuses to stop it. Miles warns her to leave but Kate decides to stay due to her promise to Flora. \n\nAfter reconciling, the group plays tag in the house. While looking for Miles, Kate is attacked by the ghost of Miss Jessel. She finds Miss Jessel's journal, which contains frightening entries about how Quint was obsessed with her and took pictures of her while she slept. When Kate enquires about it, Mrs. Grose tells her that Quint died a couple weeks following Miss Jessel's departure when he fell from his horse while riding drunk. Kate continues to see Quint and Miss Jessel's ghosts around the house, making her increasingly paranoid. \n\nKate receives art from her mother in the mail, and Mrs. Grose comments that she hopes Kate's mother's condition isn't genetic. She is led by wet footprints and Miss Jessel's ghost to discover Miss Jessel's dead body in a pond on the house grounds. Kate also has a vision of Quint raping and strangling Miss Jessel and tells Mrs. Grose, who appears to have already known about it. Mrs. Grose assures her that she made sure Quint died. Quint's ghost pushes Mrs. Grose over the stair banister, killing her. Kate takes the children away in her car. \n\nThis previous sequence is revealed to have been a vision which Kate had as she heard Mrs. Grose's words and looked at her mother's art. She walks in on the children talking about her and becomes convinced that she sees Quint's ghost in the mirror, insisting that Flora saw him too despite her protests. When Kate accidentally breaks Flora's doll, Miles smirks at her, calling her delusional. Kate walks into her mother's mental institution and approaches a figure that appears to be her mother; as the figure turns around, Kate screams in horror. The face of the figure is not revealed.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mackenzie Davis]] as Kate Mandell\n* [[Finn Wolfhard]] as Miles Fairchild\n* [[Brooklynn Prince]] as Flora Fairchild\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Darla Mandell<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/pete-davidson-judd-apatow-comedy-the-turning-universal-movie-opening-dates-1202547662/|title=Universal Dates Judd Apatow-Pete Davidson Comedy & DreamWorks' 'The Turning' For 2020|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=February 1, 2019|accessdate=February 1, 2019}}</ref> \n* [[Barbara Marten]] as Mrs. Grose\n* [[Mark Huberman]] as Bert\n* Niall Greig Fulton as Peter Quint\n* Denna Thomsen as Miss Jessel\n* Kim Adis as Rose\n* Karen Egan as Nancy\n* Darlene Garr as Holly\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe film first entered development in March 2016 and was described as a passion project for [[Steven Spielberg]], who executive produced, as he wanted to be involved in a horror film again.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://deadline.com/2016/03/juan-carlos-fresnadillo-haunted-dreamworks-horror-turn-of-the-screw-1201717460/|title=Juan Carlos Fresnadillo To Helm Ghost Tale 'Haunted' For DreamWorks|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|date=March 9, 2016|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The film adaptation went through two phases of production: first as ''Haunted'' with [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]] attached as director, then the ultimate version, renamed as ''The Turning'', with [[Floria Sigismondi]].<ref name=Development>{{Cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dreamworks-shuts-down-ghost-story-931333|title=DreamWorks Shuts Down Ghost Story 'Haunted' Weeks Before Start Date (Exclusive)|last=Masters|first=Kim|date=September 21, 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=Development2>{{Cite news| url=http://deadline.com/2017/08/floria-sigismondi-direct-the-turning-amblin-the-turn-of-the-screw-henry-james-1202155351/|title=Floria Sigismondi To Direct Henry James-Inspired 'The Turning' For Amblin|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|date=August 24, 2017|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|access-date=February 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n====Fresnadillo project (2016)====\nOn March 9, 2016, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that [[Amblin Entertainment]] was hiring Juan Carlos Fresnadillo to direct a film titled ''Haunted'', which would be inspired by [[Henry James]]' 1898 [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] ghost story, ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''.

OU president Boren suspected that the chant was learned on the fraternity's leadership cruise but the SAE national headquarters issued a statement that the chant is not one of their sanctioned songs and they would never allow such chant to be sung, stating that any member or chapter who adopts hostile chants are dealt with severe punishment.

He was posthumously awarded the second highest Indian military honour, the [[Maha Vir Chakra]] for bravery on the battlefield.\n\n==Early life==\nAdhikari was brought up in [[Nainital]], a hill station in northern [[India]]. He completed his schooling from [[St Joseph's College, Nainital|St. Joseph's College]] in 1987, Intermediate from Government Inter College, Nainital and B.Sc. from [[Kumaon University]] in the year 1992.\n\n==Career==\nHe attended the [[Indian Military Academy]], a premier military academy in India. Major Rajesh Singh was commissioned on 11 December 1993 from the Indian Military Academy.  After graduating from the Academy, he joined the 2 Mech. Infantry of the Indian Army. He was posted in 18 Grenadiers<ref>http://twdi.in/node/1080</ref> at the time of [[Kargil War]].\n\n==Kargil War==\nWhen heavy fighting broke out in the [[Kargil district|Kargil]] region of the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] owing to planned infiltration by [[Pakistan]] army [[Northern Light Infantry]] regulars dressed as [[Insurgent|militants]], the Indian Army was ordered to clear the heights of those intruders. Many tough battles took place in the region. The Mechanized Infantry's Major Rajesh Singh Adhikari, the second army officer to die in the operations against infiltrators, had caused heavy casualties to the intruders and forced them to withdraw before succumbing to injuries in Drass sector. It was one of the most significant battles, the [[Battle of Tololing]], where Rajesh made a valiant sacrifice.\n\nOn 30 May 1999, as a part of battalion operations to capture the Tololing feature, Major Rajesh Singh Adhikari, 18 Grenadiers<ref>http://twdi.in/node/1080</ref> was tasked to secure the initial foothold by capturing its forward spur where the enemy held a strongly fortified advance position. The post was located in a treacherous, mountainous terrain at about 15,000 feet and covered with snow. While Major Rajesh Singh Adhikari was leading his team towards the objective, he was fired at from two mutually supporting bunkers with universal machine guns. The officer immediately directed the rocket launcher detachment to engage the bunker and without waiting, rushed into the bunker and killed two intruders in close quarter combat.\n\nThereafter, the officer, displaying presence of mind under heavy fire, ordered his medium machine gun (MMG) detachment to fix position behind a rocky feature and engage the enemy. The assault party continued to inch their way up. Despite suffering grievous bullet injuries, Major Rajesh Singh Adhikari continued to direct his sub unit. Refusing to be evacuated, the officer charged at the second bunker and killed one more occupant, thus capturing the second bunker at Tololing which later facilitated capture of Point 4590. For conspicuous gallantry and supreme sacrifice, Major Rajesh Singh Adhikari was posthumously awarded the second highest Indian Army decoration [[Maha Vir Chakra]] for his actions in the battle.\n\n== Maha Vir Chakra Citation ==\nThe citation for  the [[Maha Vir Chakra]] reads as follows:\n{{Quotation|<center>'''Gazette Notification: 17 Pres/2000,15.8.99'''\n'''Operation: Vijay - Kargil'''\n'''Date of Award: 1999'''</center>\n\n'''Citation:'''\nOn 30 May 1999, as a part of battalion operation to capture the Tololing feature, Major Rajesh Singh Adhikari was tasked to secure the initial foothold by capturing its forward spur where the enemy held a strong position.
