He played in a total of 763&nbsp;league games and in 40 full international matches for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] during his playing career.\n\nMcCall started his career with Bradford City, where he made his [[first-team]] debut in 1982. He played six seasons at [[Valley Parade]], during which time he won the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] championship, a title which was overshadowed by the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] when 56&nbsp;people died and in which his father [[Andy McCall (footballer born 1925)|Andy]] was injured. After missing out on promotion in [[1987\u201388 in English football|1987\u201388]], McCall moved to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], for whom he scored twice but finished on the losing side in the [[1989 FA Cup Final]]. In 1991, he moved to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], with whom he spent seven seasons and won five [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|league]] titles, three [[Scottish Cup]]s and two [[Scottish League Cup]]s. McCall returned to Bradford City as captain to take them into the [[Premier League|top division]] of English football for the first time in 77 years. After four seasons he moved to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], where he retired as a player in 2005.\n\nBorn and raised in England, McCall qualified to play for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] through his Scottish father. He won 40 international [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored one goal in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in Italy. He also played in two [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championships]] but his international career ended after he was left out of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] squad.\n\nMcCall was part of the coaching staff during his second playing spell at Bradford City, briefly serving as caretaker-player manager in 2000. He continued his coaching at Sheffield United and was assistant manager to [[Neil Warnock]] until May 2007, when he returned to Bradford City as their manager. He spent two-and-a-half seasons in charge of Bradford City, leaving in February 2010. Just before the end of 2010, he was appointed [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] manager. He stayed at [[Fir Park]] for four years, helping the club finish second in the league twice. After a poor start to the 2014\u201315 season, he resigned in November 2014. McCall was appointed manager of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in March 2015, but left the club at the end of a short-term contract.\n\nMcCall returned to Bradford City for a second spell as manager in June 2016. The team reached the play-off final in his first season, but this was lost and he was sacked in February 2018. After a short spell with [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], McCall was appointed Bradford manager for a third time in February 2020.\n\n==Early and personal life==\nStuart McCall was born

He played in a total of 763&nbsp;league games and in 40 full international matches for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] during his playing career.\n\nMcCall started his career with Bradford City, where he made his [[first-team]] debut in 1982. He played six seasons at [[Valley Parade]], during which time he won the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] championship, a title which was overshadowed by the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] when 56&nbsp;people died and in which his father [[Andy McCall (footballer born 1925)|Andy]] was injured. After missing out on promotion in [[1987\u201388 in English football|1987\u201388]], McCall moved to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], for whom he scored twice but finished on the losing side in the [[1989 FA Cup Final]]. In 1991, he moved to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], with whom he spent seven seasons and won five [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|league]] titles, three [[Scottish Cup]]s and two [[Scottish League Cup]]s. McCall returned to Bradford City as captain to take them into the [[Premier League|top division]] of English football for the first time in 77 years. After four seasons he moved to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], where he retired as a player in 2005.\n\nBorn and raised in England, McCall qualified to play for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] through his Scottish father. He won 40 international [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored one goal in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in Italy. He also played in two [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championships]] but his international career ended after he was left out of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] squad.\n\nMcCall was part of the coaching staff during his second playing spell at Bradford City, briefly serving as caretaker-player manager in 2000. He continued his coaching at Sheffield United and was assistant manager to [[Neil Warnock]] until May 2007, when he returned to Bradford City as their manager. He spent two-and-a-half seasons in charge of Bradford City, leaving in February 2010. Just before the end of 2010, he was appointed [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] manager. He stayed at [[Fir Park]] for four years, helping the club finish second in the league twice. After a poor start to the 2014\u201315 season, he resigned in November 2014. McCall was appointed manager of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in March 2015, but left the club at the end of a short-term contract.\n\nMcCall returned to Bradford City for a second spell as manager in June 2016. The team reached the play-off final in his first season, but this was lost and he was sacked in February 2018. After a short spell with [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], McCall was appointed Bradford manager for a third time in February 2020.\n\n==Early and personal life==\nStuart McCall was born

{"title_page": "Offset (computer science)", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn [[computer science]], an '''offset''' within an [[Array data structure|array]] or other [[data structure]] object is an [[integer (computer science)|integer]] indicating the distance (displacement) between the beginning of the object and a given element or point, presumably within the same object. The concept of a gbgbg distance is valid only if all elements of the object are of the same size (typically given in [[Byte-addressable|bytes]] or [[Word-addressable|words]]).\n\nFor example, in <code>A</code> as an [[Array data type|array]] of characters containing <code>\"abcdef\"</code>, the fourth element containing the character <code>'d'</code> has an offset of three from the start of <code>A</code>.\n\n== In assembly language ==\nIn [[computer engineering]] and low-level programming (such as [[assembly language]]), an '''offset''' usually denotes the number of address locations added to a [[base address]] in order to get to a specific [[absolute address]]. In this (original) meaning of offset, only the basic address unit, usually the 8-bit [[byte]], is used to specify the offset's size. In this context an offset is sometimes called a '''relative address'''.\n\nIn [[IBM System/360]] instructions, a 12-bit offset embedded within certain instructions provided a range of between 0 and 4096 bytes. For example, within an unconditional branch instruction (X'47F0Fxxx'), the xxx 12bit hexadecimal offset provided the byte offset from the base register (15) to branch to. An odd offset would cause a [[program check]] (unless the base register itself also contained an odd address) - since instructions had to be aligned on half-word boundaries to execute without a program or hardware [[interrupt]]\n\nThe previous example describes an indirect way to address to a memory location in the format of segment:offset. For example, assume we want to refer to memory location 0xF867.  One way this can be accomplished is by first defining a segment with beginning address 0xF000, and then defining an offset of 0x0867.  Further, we are also allowed to shift the hexadecimal segment to reach the final absolute memory address. One thing to note here is that we can reach our final absolute address in many ways. \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Offset (Computer Science)}}\n[[Category:Computer memory]]\n\n\n{{compsci-stub}}\n\n[[de:Speicheradresse#Segmentierte Adressen]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn [[computer science]], an '''offset''' within an [[Array data structure|array]] or other [[data structure]] object is an [[integer (computer science)|integer]] indicating the distance (displacement) between the beginning of the object and a given element or point, presumably within the same object.

He is the current head coach of [[FC Haka]]. He began his career with his local club, [[TP-47]], before moving to [[FC Haka]] in 1996. A year later, he moved to France to play for [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]]. After eight years there, he joined English club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], where he spent three years before joining [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. After a loan spell with [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] during the 2009\u201310 season, he moved to Dutch club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], before joining the [[New York Red Bulls]] in 2011. After two seasons in the United States, he returned to Finland to finish his career with [[Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi|HJK]].\n\nHe mostly played in a variety of [[Midfielder|midfield]] positions during his career, and also at [[right-back]] under [[Juande Ramos]] at Tottenham.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nTainio was born in [[Tornio]]. He was promoted to the first team of his home-town club [[TP-47]] in [[Kakkonen]], Finland's third tier, at the age of fourteen. He was signed by [[Veikkausliiga]] club [[FC Haka]] for the 1996 season. Following a trial at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in March 1997, Tainio joined French club [[AJ Auxerre]] in 1997, and spent eight years at the club. He won the [[Coupe de France]] with Auxerre twice, and also gained [[UEFA Champions League]] experience.

Nevertheless, a  common principle applicable to any island, states that: whenever immigration rates are sufficiently high relative to extinction rates, islands that are closer to sources of dispersing species will have higher immigration rates, and hence lower extinction and turnover rates than more isolated islands. <ref name=\"Brown1977\" /><ref name=\"Wu1955\" />\n\nOn the other hand, if  immigration and colonization rates are low relative to extinction rates, meaning more individuals of a population die comparing to the newly arrived ones, the rescue effect is small. It can also be concluded that the insular isolation should be inversely related to the  turnover rate of the population inhabiting the island.<ref name=\"Brown1977\" />\n\nTherefore it can be concluded that  recolonization by conspecifics is an important mechanism, enabling some species to persist on islands. This is particularly true in species that represent early stages in insular taxon cycles and are characterized by species-area curves of shallow slope.<ref name=\"Cox1972\">Ricklefs RE, Cox GW. 1972. Taxon cycles in the West Indian avifauna. The American Naturalist 106: 195\u2013219.</ref><ref name=\"Scott\">Scott Wilson, Ann E. McKellar, Matthew W. Reudink, Peter P. Marra and Laurene M. Ratcliffe, Density-dependent immigration promotes population stability in a long-distance migratory bird, Population Ecology, 10.1007/s10144-017-0582-5, 59, 2, (169-178), (2017). \n</ref>\n\nAlso a common sense concept linked to the chances of a effective rescue effect on islands, is the size of the island itself. \nThis is called the \u2018target\u2010area effect\u2019, and it states that:The larger the area of the island the more likely a colonization is, either of active or passive immigrants.<ref name=\"Brown1977\" />\n\n=== Rescue effect and dispersal movements ===\nAnother common principle relating  both with the rescue effect and the previously commented insular biogeography is the  [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] capabilities of a species. The rescue effect will be increased by the tendency<ref>Diamond, M. (1975). THE ISLAND DILEMMA: LESSONS OF MODERN BIOGEOGRAPHIC STUDIES FOR THE DESIGN OF NATURAL RESERVES . Recuperado de http://www.jareddiamond.org/Jared_Diamond/Further_Reading_files/Diamond%201975.pdf</ref>, for those species that are good dispersers and hence have high immigration rates.<ref name=\"Brown1977\" />\n\n=== Rescue effect and fitness ===\nA reduction in the [[fitness (biology)]] of a population is a direct consequence of its low diversity which is dependant on the expression of deleterious [[recessive alleles]]. In large populations, [[natural selection]] keeps such alleles at a low frequency. Since they usually occur in [[heterozygotes]], they are masked by a copy of \u201cnormal alleles\u201d. But in small populations, due to the [[inbreeding]], this deleterious alleles can drift to high frequencies and become expressed in [[homozygotes]].\n\nThis homozygous (inbred) individuals often have lower chances of surviving and [[fecundity]]; reduced fitness. The natural process of migration, acts as a rescue effect by counteracting the fixation of the deleterious alleles and increasing the number of heterozygotes by importing novel alleles from other populations.\n\nThis means that immigrants make a positive contribution to fitness over and above the demographic effects of simply adding more individuals, by bringing novel [[alleles]] to the population.\n\nThis rescue effect is most likely to occur if the recipient population is small, isolated,and suffering from inbreeding depression.<ref name=\"Donald\">Macdonald, D. W., & Willis, K. J. (2013). Key Topics in Conservation Biology 2. Hoboken, NJ, Estados Unidos: Wiley.</ref>\n\n=== Rescue effect and environmental fluctuations ===\nThe effectiveness of rescue effect reducing the extinction risk via dispersal also depends on the correlation of environmental fluctuations experienced by different populations. If the correlation is high, all populations decline simultaneously reducing recolonization rates of empty patches.<ref name=\"Donald\" />\nThis means that if an environmental  phenomena diminishes the distributions or abundances of many populations  over a big geographical area at the same time, the probabilities of a rescue effect are very low.\n\n== Positive consequences ==\nSome of this previously explained concepts can be very valuable and applicable when managing populations. In addition to human mediated dispersal through reintroduction and translocation, the dispersal of individuals (consequently promoting the rescue effect) can be ensured by restoring and conserving  the habitat lying between existing populations, sometimes called the landscape matrix (term often used in [[landscape ecology]]).<ref name=\"Donald\" />\n\n== Negative consequences ==\nIncreased connectivity may also have anti rescue effects when the spread of disease, parasites or predators is favoured. Also, gene flow  can sometimes reduce local adaptation.<ref>Harding, C., & Mcnamara, M. (2002). A Unifying Framework for Metapopulation Dynamics (10.1086/341014). Recuperado de https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23174968_A_Unifying_Framework_for_Metapopulation_Dynamics</ref> With the arrival of new individuals (immigrants) contributing with their new genetic variability  the genetic differentiation  of insular population can be delayed or prevented, not allowing the adaptation of the population to their new habitat. \n\nIt has been found evidence supporting the idea that the evolution of genetically distinct insular populations represents a entry into the taxon cycle, leading to the extinction of the insular endemic populations. <ref name=\"Cox1972\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

Nevertheless, a  common principle applicable to any island, states that: whenever immigration rates are sufficiently high relative to extinction rates, islands that are closer to sources of dispersing species will have higher immigration rates, and hence lower extinction and turnover rates than more isolated islands. <ref name=\"Brown1977\" /><ref name=\"Wu1955\" />\n\nOn the other hand, if  immigration and colonization rates are low relative to extinction rates, meaning more individuals of a population die comparing to the newly arrived ones, the rescue effect is small. It can also be concluded that the insular isolation should be inversely related to the  turnover rate of the population inhabiting the island.<ref name=\"Brown1977\" />\n\nTherefore it can be concluded that  recolonization by conspecifics is an important mechanism, enabling some species to persist on islands. This is particularly true in species that represent early stages in insular taxon cycles and are characterized by species-area curves of shallow slope.<ref name=\"Cox1972\">Ricklefs RE, Cox GW. 1972.

The rescue effect will be increased by the tendency<ref>Diamond, M. (1975). THE ISLAND DILEMMA: LESSONS OF MODERN BIOGEOGRAPHIC STUDIES FOR THE DESIGN OF NATURAL RESERVES . Recuperado de http://www.jareddiamond.org/Jared_Diamond/Further_Reading_files/Diamond%201975.pdf</ref>, for those species that are good dispersers and hence have high immigration rates.<ref name=\"Brown1977\" />\n\n=== Rescue effect and fitness ===\nA reduction in the [[fitness (biology)]] of a population is a direct consequence of its low diversity which is dependant on the expression of deleterious [[recessive alleles]]. In large populations, [[natural selection]] keeps such alleles at a low frequency. Since they usually occur in [[heterozygotes]], they are masked by a copy of \u201cnormal alleles\u201d. But in small populations, due to the [[inbreeding]], this deleterious alleles can drift to high frequencies and become expressed in [[homozygotes]].\n\nThis homozygous (inbred) individuals often have lower chances of surviving and [[fecundity]]; reduced fitness. The natural process of migration, acts as a rescue effect by counteracting the fixation of the deleterious alleles and increasing the number of heterozygotes by importing novel alleles from other populations.\n\nThis means that immigrants make a positive contribution to fitness over and above the demographic effects of simply adding more individuals, by bringing novel [[alleles]] to the population.\n\nThis rescue effect is most likely to occur if the recipient population is small, isolated,and suffering from inbreeding depression.<ref name=\"Donald\">Macdonald, D. W., & Willis, K. J. (2013). Key Topics in Conservation Biology 2. Hoboken, NJ, Estados Unidos: Wiley.</ref>\n\n=== Rescue effect and environmental fluctuations ===\nThe effectiveness of rescue effect reducing the extinction risk via dispersal also depends on the correlation of environmental fluctuations experienced by different populations. If the correlation is high, all populations decline simultaneously reducing recolonization rates of empty patches.<ref name=\"Donald\" />\nThis means that if an environmental  phenomena diminishes the distributions or abundances of many populations  over a big geographical area at the same time, the probabilities of a rescue effect are very low.\n\n== Positive consequences ==\nSome of this previously explained concepts can be very valuable and applicable when managing populations. In addition to human mediated dispersal through reintroduction and translocation, the dispersal of individuals (consequently promoting the rescue effect) can be ensured by restoring and conserving  the habitat lying between existing populations, sometimes called the landscape matrix (term often used in [[landscape ecology]]).<ref name=\"Donald\" />\n\n== Negative consequences ==\nIncreased connectivity may also have anti rescue effects when the spread of disease, parasites or predators is favoured. Also, gene flow  can sometimes reduce local adaptation.<ref>Harding, C., & Mcnamara, M. (2002). A Unifying Framework for Metapopulation Dynamics (10.1086/341014). Recuperado de https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23174968_A_Unifying_Framework_for_Metapopulation_Dynamics</ref> With the arrival of new individuals (immigrants) contributing with their new genetic variability  the genetic differentiation  of insular population can be delayed or prevented, not allowing the adaptation of the population to their new habitat. \n\nIt has been found evidence supporting the idea that the evolution of genetically distinct insular populations represents a entry into the taxon cycle, leading to the extinction of the insular endemic populations. <ref name=\"Cox1972\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

George Sutton began to incorporate a puppet act into his routine at [[Nottingham]] in the 1830s, but it is [[Fred Russell (ventriloquist)|Fred Russell]] who is regarded as the father of modern ventriloquism. In 1886, he was offered a professional engagement at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in [[London]] and took up his stage career permanently. His act, based on the cheeky-boy dummy \"Coster Joe\" that would sit in his lap and 'engage in a dialogue' with him was highly influential for the entertainment format and was adopted by the next generation of performers. (A blue plaque has been embedded in a former residence of Russell by the British Heritage Society which reads 'Fred Russell the father of ventriloquism lived here').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rk0sX1reV30C&dq=father+of+modern+ventriloquism&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Gender and Ventriloquism in Victorian and Neo-Victorian Fiction: Passionate Puppets|author=Davies, Helen|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:EdgarBergenandCharlieMcCarthyStageDoorCanteen1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ventriloquist [[Edgar Bergen]] and his best-known sidekick, Charlie McCarthy, in the film ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' (1943)]]\nFred Russell's successful comedy team format was applied by the next generation of ventriloquists. It was taken forward by the British [[Arthur Prince (ventriloquist)|Arthur Prince]] with his dummy Sailor Jim, who became one of the highest paid entertainers on the music hall circuit, and by the Americans [[The Great Lester]], Frank Byron Jr., and [[Edgar Bergen]]. Bergen popularized the idea of the comedic ventriloquist.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Bergen, together with his favourite figure, Charlie McCarthy, hosted a radio program that was broadcast from 1937 to 1956. It was the #1 program on the nights it aired.

Another ventriloquist popular in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s was [[Se\u00f1or Wences]].\n\nThe art of ventriloquism was popularized by [[Y. K. Padhye]] in and M. M. Roy in South India, who are believed to be the pioneers of this field in India. Y. K. Padhye's son [[Ramdas Padhye]] borrowed from him and made the art popular amongst the masses through his performance on television. Ramdas Padhye's son [[Satyajit Padhye]] is also a ventriloquist. Similarly, Indusree a female ventriloquist from Bangalore has contributed a lot to the art. She performs with 3 dummies simultaneously. [[Venky Monkey]], [[Shanthakumar]], Dr. K. Rao, an Equine Veterinary Surgeon serving for a reputeed Stud Farm in Indi and Mimicry Srinivos, the disciples of M. M. Roy, popularized this art by giving shows in India and abroad in thousands of numbers. Mimicrist Srinivos, in particular, did several experiments in ventriloquism. He has popularized this art, calling it \"Sound illusion\", which was the topic of interest pertaining to the late M M Roy. He goes into the audience without a microphone and entertains with point blank sound illusion in addition to entertaining on stage with dummies.{{clarify|date=November 2015}}\n\nVentriloquism's popularity waned for a while.

George Sutton began to incorporate a puppet act into his routine at [[Nottingham]] in the 1830s, but it is [[Fred Russell (ventriloquist)|Fred Russell]] who is regarded as the father of modern ventriloquism. In 1886, he was offered a professional engagement at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in [[London]] and took up his stage career permanently. His act, based on the cheeky-boy dummy \"Coster Joe\" that would sit in his lap and 'engage in a dialogue' with him was highly influential for the entertainment format and was adopted by the next generation of performers. (A blue plaque has been embedded in a former residence of Russell by the British Heritage Society which reads 'Fred Russell the father of ventriloquism lived here').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rk0sX1reV30C&dq=father+of+modern+ventriloquism&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Gender and Ventriloquism in Victorian and Neo-Victorian Fiction: Passionate Puppets|author=Davies, Helen|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:EdgarBergenandCharlieMcCarthyStageDoorCanteen1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ventriloquist [[Edgar Bergen]] and his best-known sidekick, Charlie McCarthy, in the film ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' (1943)]]\nFred Russell's successful comedy team format was applied by the next generation of ventriloquists. It was taken forward by the British [[Arthur Prince (ventriloquist)|Arthur Prince]] with his dummy Sailor Jim, who became one of the highest paid entertainers on the music hall circuit, and by the Americans [[The Great Lester]], Frank Byron Jr., and [[Edgar Bergen]]. Bergen popularized the idea of the comedic ventriloquist.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Bergen, together with his favourite figure, Charlie McCarthy, hosted a radio program that was broadcast from 1937 to 1956. It was the #1 program on the nights it aired.

Another ventriloquist popular in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s was [[Se\u00f1or Wences]].\n\nThe art of ventriloquism was popularized by [[Y. K. Padhye]] in and M. M. Roy in South India, who are believed to be the pioneers of this field in India. Y. K. Padhye's son [[Ramdas Padhye]] borrowed from him and made the art popular amongst the masses through his performance on television. Ramdas Padhye's son [[Satyajit Padhye]] is also a ventriloquist. Similarly, Indusree a female ventriloquist from Bangalore has contributed a lot to the art. She performs with 3 dummies simultaneously. [[Venky Monkey]], [[Shanthakumar]], Dr. K. Rao, an Equine Veterinary Surgeon serving for a reputeed Stud Farm in Indi and Mimicry Srinivos, the disciples of M. M. Roy, popularized this art by giving shows in India and abroad in thousands of numbers. Mimicrist Srinivos, in particular, did several experiments in ventriloquism. He has popularized this art, calling it \"Sound illusion\", which was the topic of interest pertaining to the late M M Roy. He goes into the audience without a microphone and entertains with point blank sound illusion in addition to entertaining on stage with dummies.{{clarify|date=November 2015}}\n\nVentriloquism's popularity waned for a while.

The classic dummies used by ventriloquists (the technical name for which is '''ventriloquial figure''') vary in size anywhere from twelve inches tall to human-size and larger, with the height usually falling between thirty-four and forty-two inches.

Earlier, these paintings were prevalent across Andhra, as also various other parts of the country, albeit flavoured with their distinct styles and other local peculiarities dictated by the local customs and traditions. In the same way, [[Cheriyal]] scrolls must have been popular across [[Telangana]] in earlier times, though with the advent of television, cinemas and computers it has been fenced into its last outpost, the [[Cheriyal]] town.\n\n[[File:Cherial 1.jpg|thumbnail|A contemporary Cheriyal Scroll painting]]\n\n==History==\nScroll paintings have a rich history and play an important role in the Asian artistic tradition. In China, scroll paintings were part of the sophisticated traditions of the nobility and the courts. In India however, the scroll painting was the prerogative of the itinerant bard and the village artist, in essence a folk tradition of the villages.\n\nIn India, each region and village developed its own scroll painting traditions, marked by characteristic content, form and technique depending on the local ethos, patronage and socio-economic conditions. Rajasthan is known for its ''Pabuji ki Pad'', ''Devenarayana katha'' as also stories from the legend of ''Dhola and Maru''. Goa evolved the ''Dasavathara'', as Maharashtra did ''Pinguli'' and the ''Chitra Katha'' traditions. Maharashtra and Gujarat are also known for a sophisticated scroll painting tradition called the ''Prasasti Patra''. Orissa and Bengal are famous for their ''Patachitra'' traditions.<ref>Scroll Paintings of Bengal: Art in the Village By Amitabh Sengupta published by AuthorHouse</ref>\n\nWhile the above-mentioned traditions could have significantly influenced the Cheriyal scroll paintings and artists, the [[Cheriyal]] paintings were and continue to be a distinctly local invention, peculiar to the [[Telangana]] region, drawing mainly on local traditions. It can safely be said that the local temple art traditions and the [[Kalamkari]] tradition across [[Telangana]] in particular, and the graphic art traditions of the Deccan and South India in general were the major influences that shaped and guided the art of scroll paintings. However, it should also be remembered that the sphere of activity, subject and artistic idiom of every scroll painting including that of Cheriyal is peculiar and confined to the village or habitment.\n\nTo quote from A. L. Dallaiccola's South Indian Paintings- A catalogue of the British Museum collection - ''Although in the past the majority of Indian people might have been illiterate, they were not uneducated. They were taught the principles ruling their religious and social life through the recitation of stories drawn from the epics, the puranas and other religious texts... In the past, the retelling of these stories provided the education of the unlettered, and the discourses were accompanied by visual aids: scrolls, painted cloth hangings, sets of paintings, and wooden boxes with folding, concertina-like doors painted with scenes from the 'career' of a deity, such as the portable shrine from [[Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh|Tirupati]] that is now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]... The earliest known reference to the picture showmen is found in [[Patanjali]]'s ''Mahabhashya'' (2nd century BC). Commenting on the passage on the historic present in [[A. R. Raja Raja Varma|Panini]]'s grammar, the ''Ashtadhyayi'' (c. 5th century BC), [[Patanjali]] takes as an example some picture showmen who are discussing the killing of Kamsa at the hands of Krishna... There is also a specific mention of a picture showing Kamsa being dragged by the hair and beaten by Krishna. Numerous references to picture showmen and painted scrolls occur in literary sources. The scrolls showing the torments of hell, ''yamapattaka'', seem to have been particularly popular.''<ref name=\"MuseumDallapiccola2010\">{{cite book|author1=British Museum|author2=Anna Libera Dallapiccola|title=South Indian Paintings: A Catalogue of the British Museum Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIzWapiacQcC&pg=PA78|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-7141-2424-7}}</ref>\n\nThe Mandhets were the itinerant bards and performers of Andhra Pradesh while the Nakashis were the artists. The Nakashis of [[Telangana]] also made dolls, much like the [[Kinnal]] dolls of Karnataka, in addition to the painted scrolls. These scrolls were a very important part of the sociological and cultural setting of [[Telangana]]. As these paintings are now confined to [[Cheriyal]] village, they are called [[Cheriyal]] scrolls. In earlier times, the scrolls were a colourful backdrop to the equally interesting oral traditions of the common people, - the village hajjam-barber, toddy tapper, dhobhi-washerman, chamar-leatherworker, fisherman, weaver and farmer: (''Madiga, Goud, Mudiraju, Malas, Padmashali, Chakala and Mangali''<ref>Folk Painting Traditions of India by Sarita Chauhan Booklet series - 52 published by Institute for Social Democracy http://www.isd.net.in/Publication/Booklet/2012/Booklet_52.pdf</ref>) the seven working and marginalised castes and communities of the village. The scrolls set out the adventures and exploits of local folk heroes who performed on the fringes of the epics, Puranas, etc. of the Hindu 'Greater Tradition'. Each community had its peculiarities and its favourite heroes and heroines as also selection of stories from local Mythologies.<ref>http://jigyasa0.tripod.com/folk.html Jagdish and Kamla Mittal Museum of Indian Art</ref> It was also customary to sacrifice a goat after the recitation of the story from the scroll in some communities.\n\n==Present times==\nAt present, Cheriyal painting work is continuing  by\nthe families of D. Vaikuntam, D.Nageshar, D.Rakesh, D.Vinay  Kumar, D.Venkataramana,\nD.Pavan Kumar.D.Saikiran,D.sravan kumar.\nDhanalokota Vaikuntam started learning work\nfrom his father Venkataramiah and elder brother Chandraiah at\nthe age of 12. He studied intermediate and at present he is\nliving at Hyderabad. He got married with vanaja at the age of\n20. After the marriage with Vaikuntam, vanaja also started\ndoing Cherial painting. He trained to his children Sarika,\nRakesh and Vinay Kumar. He received many awards and\ncertificates for his excellency in Cherial painting.\n\nDhanalokota Nageshwar started learning work from childhood beside setting his father Chandraiah. He studied intermediate and at present he is\nliving in Hyderabad. He got married with padma at the age of\n20. After the marriage with Nageshwar, padma also started\ndoing Cherial painting. He trained to his children saikiran,\nSoujanya and sravan Kumar. He received many awards and\ncertificates for his excellency in Cherial painting.\n\nToday the long stories from the local mythologies have been cut short, as the traditional patrons for the long scrolls no longer exist. The artists have been forced to adapt and nowadays they paint smaller versions of the scrolls, depicting a single episode or character from the traditional stories. These are amenable to framing and can be hung on walls in modern homes. Further, the colours are no longer prepared in the traditional manner. While earlier, they used natural white extracted from sea shells, black from lampsoot and yellow from turmeric. However, the traditional art continues to linger and survive and even has been a source of inspiration to contemporary artists like Laxman Aelay<ref>http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/2013-10-06/Painting-a-new--narrative-73269</ref> of Kadirengudam village of Andhra Pradesh.\n\n==The Tradition==\n[[File:Cherial 5.jpg|thumbnail|left|Contemporary Cheriyal Dolls]]\nThe traditional art form became an inseparable part of the profession of the story-telling, balladeer community known as ''Kaki Padagollu''. They displayed the scrolls and accompanied by music and dance went from village to village narrating and singing their ballads based from their rich folklore which was rooted in the [[Puranas]] and Indian Epics, enlivening many a lazy village evening.\n\nIn a typical recitation, the storyteller-balladeer would  wander from village to village in a team of usually five people, with two to narrate the story while the others would provide a simple but hectic musical accompaniment with the harmonium, tabala and castanets. The stage would also be a simple affair (many times even to the extent of being a rough and ready fixture), erected on four poles with a horizontal bar on which the scrolls could be displayed.\n \n[[File:Cheriyal painting - toddy tappers.jpg|thumb|A traditional Cheriyal scroll painting depicting the legends of the toddy tapper community. Circa 18th - 19th century.]]\n\nThe scroll would flow like a film roll. It was generally about \nthree feet in width and went up to 40 \u2013 45 feet in length, depending upon the story. The traditional scrolls are normally in vertical format, illustrating stories in a series of horizontal panels. A floral border in the middle separates the two panels, while the linear narrative is demonstrated by holding in both hands or suspending it from a tree or a building and continually rolling it. Like large sized comic strips, each panel of the scroll depicted one part of the story. Hence, a scroll would easily have around 50 panels. As the bard would narrate the story, the panel depicting that particular part of the story would be displayed. The choice of episodes and iconography of each deity was painted, keeping in mind the caste for which the scroll was made.\n\n[[File:Cherial 3.jpg|thumbnail|left|A modern Cheriyal painting in making]]\n\nBy virtue of its distinct traditional style and characteristics [[Cheriyal]] Paintings were recently given a Geographical Indications (GI) tag. There are very few artists remaining who continue to paint using this unique technique. A recent innovation has been the painting of single pictures (as opposed to a continuous scroll) meant for wall decorations.\n\n== Process ==\nThe making of the canvas is a very elaborate procedure. The [[Khadi]] cotton is treated with a mixture of starch (from rice), suddha matti (white mud), a paste of boiled tamarind seeds and gum water thrice. It has to be ensured that every coating is thoroughly dried before the next one is applied.\nOnce the canvas is ready, the artists sketch the outline directly onto the canvas using a brush.

Earlier, these paintings were prevalent across Andhra, as also various other parts of the country, albeit flavoured with their distinct styles and other local peculiarities dictated by the local customs and traditions. In the same way, [[Cheriyal]] scrolls must have been popular across [[Telangana]] in earlier times, though with the advent of television, cinemas and computers it has been fenced into its last outpost, the [[Cheriyal]] town.\n\n[[File:Cherial 1.jpg|thumbnail|A contemporary Cheriyal Scroll painting]]\n\n==History==\nScroll paintings have a rich history and play an important role in the Asian artistic tradition. In China, scroll paintings were part of the sophisticated traditions of the nobility and the courts. In India however, the scroll painting was the prerogative of the itinerant bard and the village artist, in essence a folk tradition of the villages.\n\nIn India, each region and village developed its own scroll painting traditions, marked by characteristic content, form and technique depending on the local ethos, patronage and socio-economic conditions. Rajasthan is known for its ''Pabuji ki Pad'', ''Devenarayana katha'' as also stories from the legend of ''Dhola and Maru''. Goa evolved the ''Dasavathara'', as Maharashtra did ''Pinguli'' and the ''Chitra Katha'' traditions. Maharashtra and Gujarat are also known for a sophisticated scroll painting tradition called the ''Prasasti Patra''. Orissa and Bengal are famous for their ''Patachitra'' traditions.<ref>Scroll Paintings of Bengal: Art in the Village By Amitabh Sengupta published by AuthorHouse</ref>\n\nWhile the above-mentioned traditions could have significantly influenced the Cheriyal scroll paintings and artists, the [[Cheriyal]] paintings were and continue to be a distinctly local invention, peculiar to the [[Telangana]] region, drawing mainly on local traditions. It can safely be said that the local temple art traditions and the [[Kalamkari]] tradition across [[Telangana]] in particular, and the graphic art traditions of the Deccan and South India in general were the major influences that shaped and guided the art of scroll paintings. However, it should also be remembered that the sphere of activity, subject and artistic idiom of every scroll painting including that of Cheriyal is peculiar and confined to the village or habitment.\n\nTo quote from A. L. Dallaiccola's South Indian Paintings- A catalogue of the British Museum collection - ''Although in the past the majority of Indian people might have been illiterate, they were not uneducated. They were taught the principles ruling their religious and social life through the recitation of stories drawn from the epics, the puranas and other religious texts... In the past, the retelling of these stories provided the education of the unlettered, and the discourses were accompanied by visual aids: scrolls, painted cloth hangings, sets of paintings, and wooden boxes with folding, concertina-like doors painted with scenes from the 'career' of a deity, such as the portable shrine from [[Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh|Tirupati]] that is now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]... The earliest known reference to the picture showmen is found in [[Patanjali]]'s ''Mahabhashya'' (2nd century BC). Commenting on the passage on the historic present in [[A. R. Raja Raja Varma|Panini]]'s grammar, the ''Ashtadhyayi'' (c. 5th century BC), [[Patanjali]] takes as an example some picture showmen who are discussing the killing of Kamsa at the hands of Krishna... There is also a specific mention of a picture showing Kamsa being dragged by the hair and beaten by Krishna. Numerous references to picture showmen and painted scrolls occur in literary sources. The scrolls showing the torments of hell, ''yamapattaka'', seem to have been particularly popular.''<ref name=\"MuseumDallapiccola2010\">{{cite book|author1=British Museum|author2=Anna Libera Dallapiccola|title=South Indian Paintings: A Catalogue of the British Museum Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIzWapiacQcC&pg=PA78|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-7141-2424-7}}</ref>\n\nThe Mandhets were the itinerant bards and performers of Andhra Pradesh while the Nakashis were the artists. The Nakashis of [[Telangana]] also made dolls, much like the [[Kinnal]] dolls of Karnataka, in addition to the painted scrolls. These scrolls were a very important part of the sociological and cultural setting of [[Telangana]]. As these paintings are now confined to [[Cheriyal]] village, they are called [[Cheriyal]] scrolls. In earlier times, the scrolls were a colourful backdrop to the equally interesting oral traditions of the common people, - the village hajjam-barber, toddy tapper, dhobhi-washerman, chamar-leatherworker, fisherman, weaver and farmer: (''Madiga, Goud, Mudiraju, Malas, Padmashali, Chakala and Mangali''<ref>Folk Painting Traditions of India by Sarita Chauhan Booklet series - 52 published by Institute for Social Democracy http://www.isd.net.in/Publication/Booklet/2012/Booklet_52.pdf</ref>) the seven working and marginalised castes and communities of the village. The scrolls set out the adventures and exploits of local folk heroes who performed on the fringes of the epics, Puranas, etc. of the Hindu 'Greater Tradition'. Each community had its peculiarities and its favourite heroes and heroines as also selection of stories from local Mythologies.<ref>http://jigyasa0.tripod.com/folk.html Jagdish and Kamla Mittal Museum of Indian Art</ref> It was also customary to sacrifice a goat after the recitation of the story from the scroll in some communities.\n\n==Present times==\nAt present, Cheriyal painting work is continuing  by\nthe families of D. Vaikuntam, D.Nageshar, D.Rakesh, D.Vinay  Kumar, D.Venkataramana,\nD.Pavan Kumar.D.Saikiran,D.sravan kumar.\nDhanalokota Vaikuntam started learning work\nfrom his father Venkataramiah and elder brother Chandraiah at\nthe age of 12. He studied intermediate and at present he is\nliving at Hyderabad. He got married with vanaja at the age of\n20. After the marriage with Vaikuntam, vanaja also started\ndoing Cherial painting. He trained to his children Sarika,\nRakesh and Vinay Kumar. He received many awards and\ncertificates for his excellency in Cherial painting.\n\nToday the long stories from the local mythologies have been cut short, as the traditional patrons for the long scrolls no longer exist. The artists have been forced to adapt and nowadays they paint smaller versions of the scrolls, depicting a single episode or character from the traditional stories. These are amenable to framing and can be hung on walls in modern homes. Further, the colours are no longer prepared in the traditional manner. While earlier, they used natural white extracted from sea shells, black from lampsoot and yellow from turmeric. However, the traditional art continues to linger and survive and even has been a source of inspiration to contemporary artists like Laxman Aelay<ref>http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/2013-10-06/Painting-a-new--narrative-73269</ref> of Kadirengudam village of Andhra Pradesh.\n\n==The Tradition==\n[[File:Cherial 5.jpg|thumbnail|left|Contemporary Cheriyal Dolls]]\nThe traditional art form became an inseparable part of the profession of the story-telling, balladeer community known as ''Kaki Padagollu''. They displayed the scrolls and accompanied by music and dance went from village to village narrating and singing their ballads based from their rich folklore which was rooted in the [[Puranas]] and Indian Epics, enlivening many a lazy village evening.\n\nIn a typical recitation, the storyteller-balladeer would  wander from village to village in a team of usually five people, with two to narrate the story while the others would provide a simple but hectic musical accompaniment with the harmonium, tabala and castanets. The stage would also be a simple affair (many times even to the extent of being a rough and ready fixture), erected on four poles with a horizontal bar on which the scrolls could be displayed.\n \n[[File:Cheriyal painting - toddy tappers.jpg|thumb|A traditional Cheriyal scroll painting depicting the legends of the toddy tapper community. Circa 18th - 19th century.]]\n\nThe scroll would flow like a film roll. It was generally about \nthree feet in width and went up to 40 \u2013 45 feet in length, depending upon the story. The traditional scrolls are normally in vertical format, illustrating stories in a series of horizontal panels. A floral border in the middle separates the two panels, while the linear narrative is demonstrated by holding in both hands or suspending it from a tree or a building and continually rolling it. Like large sized comic strips, each panel of the scroll depicted one part of the story. Hence, a scroll would easily have around 50 panels. As the bard would narrate the story, the panel depicting that particular part of the story would be displayed. The choice of episodes and iconography of each deity was painted, keeping in mind the caste for which the scroll was made.\n\n[[File:Cherial 3.jpg|thumbnail|left|A modern Cheriyal painting in making]]\n\nBy virtue of its distinct traditional style and characteristics [[Cheriyal]] Paintings were recently given a Geographical Indications (GI) tag. There are very few artists remaining who continue to paint using this unique technique. A recent innovation has been the painting of single pictures (as opposed to a continuous scroll) meant for wall decorations.\n\n== Process ==\nThe making of the canvas is a very elaborate procedure. The [[Khadi]] cotton is treated with a mixture of starch (from rice), suddha matti (white mud), a paste of boiled tamarind seeds and gum water thrice. It has to be ensured that every coating is thoroughly dried before the next one is applied.\nOnce the canvas is ready, the artists sketch the outline directly onto the canvas using a brush. The outlines are very well defined and sharply reflecting the quality and experience of the craftsman.\nThe colors are made by the artists from natural sources. Brushes are made with hair of squirrels tied to a stick.\nDolls and masks are made of wood, saw dust and tamarind paste. Masks are made even with coconut shells.\n\n[[File:Cherial 4.jpg|thumbnail|Contemporary Cheriyal Dolls]]\n\n== Characteristics ==\nCheriyal Paintings can be easily recognised by the following peculiarities and unique characteristics:\n\n\u2022 Painted in vivid hues, mostly primary colors, with a predominance of red in the background, the paintings are characterised by the unbridled imagination of the local artisans who were not constrained by the academic rigour that characterised the more classical [[Tanjore painting]] and [[Mysore painting]].
