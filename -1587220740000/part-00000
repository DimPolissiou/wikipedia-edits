However, Todd brought Sarah around to the idea of having the baby. \n\nOn Christmas Day 2003, Sarah's brother [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Adam Rickitt]]), revealed to their mother that his sister was pregnant.

Sarah, already a teenage mother, was 16 at the time she conceived Billy, after Todd had suggested the two try for a baby of their own. Sarah was reluctant, and when she discovered her pregnancy she was considering getting an abortion since her mother [[Gail Platt]] ([[Helen Worth]]) recently got stress due to her stepfather [[Richard Hillman]] ([[Brian Capron]]) attempted murder towards her and her family. However, Todd brought Sarah around to the idea of having the baby. \n\nOn Christmas Day 2003, Sarah's brother [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Adam Rickitt]]), revealed to their mother that his sister was pregnant. By this time Sarah had made a firm decision to keep the baby. For the next few months this caused friction between Gail and Sarah and moved out with Bethany along with Todd to live with  Bethany's paternal grandmother [[Brenda Fearns]] ([[Julia Deakin]]) until she suffered an mental illness due to  her grieve the loss of her son [[Neil Fearns]] ([[Paul Holowaty]]). In April 2004, Sarah suffered her first [[placental abruption]], and felt Billy was dead. Once at the hospital, it was discovered Billy was fine, however his heartbeat was slow. This was caused by some uncertainty within Sarah and Todd's relationship. However, when Todd reveals to Sarah that he is gay, she suffers a second placental abruption on 1 June 2004, three months away from her due date. The abruption was so serious Billy had to be born by [[caesarean section]]. His first 24 hours alive were critical, and Todd was never granted access to see him. Sarah did not want Todd to see Billy, and she did not want her son, either. On 2 June, Sarah finally agreed to go and see her son, who was in an incubator. However, Billy's health deteriorated and whilst Sarah was bonding with Billy for the first time, he died. Todd never saw his son alive, apart from a photograph that Gail gave him after his death. Although he allowed to name as a father, Gail and Sarah agreed that Billy should have Platt instead. Sarah then  continuously blamed herself for his death until his funeral on 7 June 2004.\n\nDespite doubts from the rest of the street's members, Todd finally showed up with his family to say goodbye to his son. Sarah and Todd regularly visited his grave until they left Weatherfield.\n\nIn December 2015, when Sarah discovered she was pregnant with her deceased ex-boyfriend [[Callum Logan]]'s (Sean Ward) baby, she tells Todd, whom she finally repaired things with since her return in March after eleven years of ignorance, that she wants an abortion. However, Todd reminds Sarah of how she felt after Billy died and that this baby could possibly replace him. Sarah later changes her mind after [[Kylie Platt]] ([[Paula Lane]]), stopped her from making the decision as she also reminded Sarah that her own son with Callum, [[Max Turner (Coronation Street)|Max Turner]] (Harry McDermott), does not remind her of him and she loves him no matter what. Sarah later gave birth to [[Harry Platt (Coronation Street)|Harry]] in March by caesarean section, like Billy.\n\n==Dr. Patel==\n'''Dr. Patel''' was first seen when Josephine Lloyd-Welcome played [[Sunita Alahan]]'s ([[Shobna Gulati]]) doctor in 2004, but was not credited as Dr. Patel. She works at Rosamund Street Medical Centre. In 2008, she re-appeared when her receptionist, [[Gail McIntyre|Gail Platt]] ([[Helen Worth]]) asked her to visit neighbour [[Jerry Morton]] ([[Michael Starke (actor)|Michael Starke]]), who had recently suffered a heart attack. She appeared again the following spring, when Gail's boyfriend [[Joe McIntyre (Coronation Street)|Joe McIntyre]] ([[Reece Dinsdale]]) suffered a back injury.

[[Candice Stowe]] ([[Nikki Sanderson]]) later finds out that he is no longer a footballer and that Warren had been telling lies to impress her, resulting in Candice dumping him. Later Warren joins [[Weatherfield County FC]], and Candice decides that she wants to give him another chance. In July 2005, Warren leaves the Street to launch his football career and start a new life in Spain, leaving Candice behind after they split up again.\n\nHe makes a surprise return to [[Weatherfield]] on 20 November 2006 when he is back in England for trials with [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], which he fails. Warren moves to Spain again, and in early December 2006 his mother goes to visit him to see if he has heard from father Danny who had left Weatherfield and disappeared.

Nelsen: ''Geometric Proofs of the Weitzenb\u00f6ck and Hadwiger-Finsler Inequalities''.

To achieve that the [[Fermat point]] is used to partition the triangle into three obtuse subtriangles with a <math>120^\\circ</math> angle and each of those subtriangles is replicated three times within the equilateral triangle next to it. This only works if every angle of the triangle is smaller than <math>120^\\circ</math>, since otherwise the Fermat point is not located in the interior of the triangle and becomes a vertex instead. However if one angle is greater or equal to <math>120^\\circ</math> it is possible to replicate the whole triangle three times within the largest equilateral triangle, so the sum of areas of all equilateral triangles stays greater than the threefold area of the triangle anyhow.\n\n== Further proofs ==\nThe proof of this inequality was set as a question in the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] of 1961. Even so, the result is not too difficult to derive using [[Heron's formula]] for the area of a triangle:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta & {} =\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(a+b+c)(a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b)} \\\\\n& {} =\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)-(a^4+b^4+c^4)}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n=== First method ===\n\nIt can be shown that the area of the inner [[Napoleon's triangle]], which must be nonnegative, is<ref>Coxeter, H.S.M., and  Greitzer, Samuel L. ''Geometry Revisited'', page 64.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{24}(a^2+b^2+c^2-4\\sqrt{3}\\Delta),</math>\n\nso the expression in parentheses must be greater than or equal to 0.\n\n=== Second method ===\n\nThis method assumes no knowledge of inequalities except that all squares are nonnegative.\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n{} & (a^2 - b^2)^2 + (b^2 - c^2)^2 + (c^2 - a^2)^2 \\geq 0 \\\\\n{} \\iff & 2(a^4+b^4+c^4) - 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2) \\geq 0 \\\\\n{} \\iff & \\frac{4(a^4+b^4+c^4)}{3} \\geq \\frac{4(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)}{3} \\\\\n{} \\iff & \\frac{(a^4+b^4+c^4) + 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)}{3} \\geq 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)-(a^4+b^4+c^4) \\\\\n{} \\iff & \\frac{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2}{3} \\geq (4\\Delta)^2,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nand the result follows immediately by taking the positive square root of both sides. From the first inequality we can also see that equality occurs only when <math>a = b = c</math> and the triangle is equilateral.\n\n===Third method===\n\nThis proof assumes knowledge of the [[AM\u2013GM inequality]].\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& & (a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2 & \\geq & & 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & & 2a^2+2b^2+2c^2 & \\geq & & 2ab+2bc+2ac \\\\\n\\iff & & 3(a^2+b^2+c^2) & \\geq & & (a + b + c)^2 \\\\\n\\iff & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\geq & & \\sqrt{3(a+b+c)\\left(\\frac{a+b+c}{3}\\right)^3} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\geq & & \\sqrt{3 (a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)} \\\\\n\\iff & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\geq & & 4 \\sqrt3 \\Delta.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAs we have used the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality, equality only occurs when <math>a = b = c</math> and the triangle is equilateral.\n\n===Fourth method===\n\nWrite <math>x=\\cot A, c=\\cot A+\\cot B>0</math> so the sum <math>S=\\cot A+\\cot B+\\cot C=c+\\frac{1-x(c-x)}{c}</math> and <math>cS=c^2-xc+x^2+1=\\left(x-\\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{c\\sqrt{3}}{2}-1\\right)^2+c\\sqrt{3}\\ge c\\sqrt{3}</math> i.e. <math>S\\ge\\sqrt{3}</math>.

Even so, the result is not too difficult to derive using [[Heron's formula]] for the area of a triangle:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta & {} =\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(a+b+c)(a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b)} \\\\\n& {} =\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)-(a^4+b^4+c^4)}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n=== First method ===\n\nIt can be shown that the area of the inner [[Napoleon's triangle]], which must be nonnegative, is<ref>Coxeter, H.S.M., and  Greitzer, Samuel L. ''Geometry Revisited'', page 64.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{24}(a^2+b^2+c^2-4\\sqrt{3}\\Delta),</math>\n\nso the expression in parentheses must be greater than or equal to 0.\n\n=== Second method ===\n\nThis method assumes no knowledge of inequalities except that all squares are nonnegative.\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n{} & (a^2 - b^2)^2 + (b^2 - c^2)^2 + (c^2 - a^2)^2 \\geq 0 \\\\\n{} \\iff & 2(a^4+b^4+c^4) - 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2) \\geq 0 \\\\\n{} \\iff & \\frac{4(a^4+b^4+c^4)}{3} \\geq \\frac{4(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)}{3} \\\\\n{} \\iff & \\frac{(a^4+b^4+c^4) + 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)}{3} \\geq 2(a^2 b^2+a^2c^2+b^2c^2)-(a^4+b^4+c^4) \\\\\n{} \\iff & \\frac{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2}{3} \\geq (4\\Delta)^2,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nand the result follows immediately by taking the positive square root of both sides. From the first inequality we can also see that equality occurs only when <math>a = b = c</math> and the triangle is equilateral.\n\n===Third method===\n\nThis proof assumes knowledge of the [[AM\u2013GM inequality]].\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& & (a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2 & \\geq & & 0 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & & 2a^2+2b^2+2c^2 & \\geq & & 2ab+2bc+2ac \\\\\n\\iff & & 3(a^2+b^2+c^2) & \\geq & & (a + b + c)^2 \\\\\n\\iff & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\geq & & \\sqrt{3(a+b+c)\\left(\\frac{a+b+c}{3}\\right)^3} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\geq & & \\sqrt{3 (a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)} \\\\\n\\iff & & a^2+b^2+c^2 & \\geq & & 4 \\sqrt3 \\Delta.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAs we have used the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality, equality only occurs when <math>a = b = c</math> and the triangle is equilateral.\n\n===Fourth method===\n\nWrite <math>x=\\cot A, c=\\cot A+\\cot B>0</math> so the sum <math>S=\\cot A+\\cot B+\\cot C=c+\\frac{1-x(c-x)}{c}</math> and <math>cS=c^2-xc+x^2+1=\\left(x-\\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{c\\sqrt{3}}{2}-1\\right)^2+c\\sqrt{3}\\ge c\\sqrt{3}</math> i.e. <math>S\\ge\\sqrt{3}</math>. But <math>\\cot A=\\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{4\\Delta}</math>, so <math>S=\\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{4\\Delta}</math>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of triangle inequalities]]\n*[[Isoperimetric inequality]]\n*[[Hadwiger\u2013Finsler inequality]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References & further reading==\n*Claudi Alsina, Roger B.

It was originally developed during the 1950s by French aircraft manufacturer [[Morane-Saulnier]] as the '''MS.880'''.\n\nOn 10 June 1959, the prototype Rallye conducted the type's [[maiden flight]]; on 21 November 1961, [[type certification]] for the first production versions of the aircraft, designated as the '''MS.880B''' and more powerful '''MS.885''', was awarded. Successive models of the Rallye were developed and manufactured; changes typically involved the installation of more powerful engines, structural strengthening, and the expansion of some of the [[flight control surfaces]]. As part of efforts to access the lucrative [[North America]]n market, [[distributor]] agreements were formed with multiple US-based companies, such as the [[Waco Aircraft Company]] and [[BFA Aviation]], to market, sell, and service the Rallye. These efforts, while not being trouble-free, provided valuable sales of the type.\n\nDuring 1979, SOCATA (which Morane-Saulnier had previously merged into) decided to rename all of the Rallye series' various models, each being assigned their own individual ''[[Gaul|Gallic]]'' names. During the early 1980s, the Rallye was eventually phased out of production in France in favour of the newer [[Socata TB]] series. During December 1984, the final SOCATA-built aircraft was delivered; the entire production run had covered approximately 3,300 aircraft. However, the Rallye continued to be [[Licensed production|produced under licence]] in Poland by aviation company [[PZL]], which marketed their own models under the '''PZL Koliber''' ({{lang-en|Hummingbird}}) name. On 18 April 1978, the first flight of a prototype Koliber occurred; quantity production of the type commenced in Poland during the following year.\n\n==Development==\nDuring 1958, in response to the launch of a French government competition seeking such an aircraft, French aviation company [[Morane-Saulnier]] decided to commence work upon the design of a new single-engined light aircraft, initially designated as the ''MS.880 Rallye Club''. According to aerospace publication [[Flying (magazine)|Flying Magazine]], in comparison with other light aircraft of the era, was relatively slow-moving and cheap fixed-wing aircraft; specifically, the magazine lauded the Rallye as being available \"for a price much lower than any true [[STOL]] [short takeoff and landing], four-place aircraft\".<ref name = \"tram 35\"/> It featured a relatively simplistic design which enabled it to be provided at a highly affordable price to customers, which, along with the aircraft's capable STOL performance, was viewed as being a highly attractive selling point, particularly to customers within the [[North America]]n market.<ref name = \"tram 35\">Trammell 1971, p. 35.</ref>\n\nOn 10 June 1959, the prototype Rallye, powered by a {{convert|90|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine, conducted its [[maiden flight]]. On 21 November 1961, the first production versions of the aircraft, designated as the ''MS.880B'' and more powerful ''MS.885'', received their [[type certification]], clearing them to perform operational flights.<ref name=\"Janes 76 p64\">Taylor 1976, p. 64.</ref> Thereafter, a range of improvements and alterations were progressively made upon the design as new models of the Rallye were introduced; typical advances included the adoption of more powerful engines, improved payload capability, and strengthened structure, the addition of wheel fairings, increased ground clearance for the propeller, expanded [[rudder]] and [[aileron]]s, and changes to the cockpit canopy arrangement.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/><ref name=\"planeandpilot_1999_11_30_socata_rallye\"/> \n\nOn 19 November 1962, Morane-Saulnier filed for [[bankruptcy]], and in January 1963 was placed under the control of [[Potez]], which established the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Exploitation des Etablissements Morane-Saulnier (\"SEEMS\") to manage its assets. On 20 May 1965, [[Sud Aviation]] acquired SEEMS from Potez, forming Gerance de Etablissements Morane-Saulnier (\"GEMS\").{{sfn|Simpson|1991|p=215}} In early 1966, Sud Aviation created another new subsidiary, [[SOCATA]], to continue development and production of the Rallye series.{{sfn|Simpson|1991|p=16}} SOCATA continued to manufacture the Rallye in large numbers through the remainder of the 1960s and through the 1970s.<ref name=\"Donald world p804\"/>{{sfn|Simpson|1991|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nDuring the early 1960s, a [[distributor]] arrangement between Morane-Saulnier and the American [[Ohio]]-based [[Waco Aircraft Company]] was established regarding the marketing, sale, and servicing of the Rallye throughout the sizable and attractive [[North American]] market.<ref name = \"tram 35 37\"/> While the type was sold under the Waco name, the Rallye had little time to prove itself prior to Waco winding up its aviation activities during 1971, resulting in only a handful of aircraft being delivered under its oversight.<ref name=\"planeandpilot_1999_11_30_socata_rallye\">[http://www.planeandpilotmag.com/article/socata-rallye-waco-minerva/#.WJcSsZXnZJg \"SOCATA 'Rallye'-Waco 'Minerva',\"] 30 November 1999, ''Plane & Pilot'' Magazine, Retrieved: 5 February 2017.</ref> As a consequence of Waco's dissolution, third party aviation companies purchased the various leftover assets and continued to provide spare parts and services to American owners of the Rallye.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/>\n\nIn the late 1960s, SOCATA pursued the development of an enlarged 7-seat version powered by a {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Lycoming O-540|Lycoming IO-540-K]] engine, the ST.60 Rallye 7. Two prototypes were constructed: a version with [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable]] [[tricycle landing gear]], first flown on 3 January 1969, and an otherwise similar aircraft with fixed landing gear. However, SOCATA was not confident that a sufficient market for the aircraft existed, and no further production ensued.{{sfn|Simpson|1991|p=16}}\n\nIn the early 1970s, [[New York State|Now York]]-based company [[BFA Aviation]] was appointed as the type's new distributor within North America.<ref name = \"tram 35\"/> BFA, via several subsidiaries of its parent company Aerocon Inc, performed the final assembly of the Rallye for those sold to American customers. The use of American suppliers within the aircraft's supply chain, such as the [[Franklin 6 series|Franklin 6A-350-C1]] engine, [[Hartzell Propeller|Hartzell]] or [[McCauley Propeller Systems|McCauley]]-built propellers, wheels, brakes, and some of the cockpit instrumentation, was made upon some models of the Rallye, such as the Minerva.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/> Under the initial arrangement, US-built components would be shipped across the [[Atlantic ocean]] to reach the facilities of Sud Aviation and its subsidiary companies in France for integration onto a French-built airframe which, following completion and initial test flights, would be disassembled into sections and conveyed to BFA Aviation in the United States for final assembly and sale; efforts to reduce unnecessary shipping and thus cost were explored.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/>\n\nDuring 1979, SOCATA decided to embark upon a new production programme, one of the results of which being the renaming of the various models of Rallye series, each one receiving an individual, \"more Gallic\" name.<ref name=\"History\">\"[http://www.flyrallye.com/Rallye_History/rallye_history.html Rallye History]\". ''Fly Rallye''. Retrieved 3 August 2008.</ref> During the 1980s, the type was gradually superseded and phased out of production in France by the newer [[Socata TB]] series.

Note the type's large tail [[fin]]]]\nSOCATA's decision to terminate production in France was not the end of all manufacturing activity for the type however. During the 1970s, SOCATA had sold a [[licensed production|license for production]] of the Rallye 100ST model to the Polish State aviation company [[PZL]], which led to the aircraft being independently constructed in its facilities in [[Warsaw]] as the ''PZL Koliber'' (''Humming Bird''). On 18 April 1978, the first PZL-built aircraft performed its maiden flight. During 1979, quantity production of the Koliber commenced; an initial batch of ten aircraft was produced that year.<ref name=\"Janes 88 p193\">Taylor 1988, p. 193.</ref>\n\nDuring February 1994, type certification of the Koliber was granted by the American [[Federal Aviation Administration]], clearing the Polish derivatives to be sold and operated within the North American market.<ref name = \"benen 67\">Benenson 1995, p. 67.</ref> Shortly thereafter, a distributor arrangement was formed with [[Cadmus Corporation]] to market and service the Koliber in the Americas. Among its uses, the aircraft proved to be a good trainer, in part due to the generous visibility provided from its cockpit and forgiving flight characteristics.<ref name = \"benen 67 68\">Benenson 1995, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Socata MS-880B Rallye Club Deurne.JPG|thumb|right|A MS.880B Rallye Club]]\nThe SOCATA Rallye is a single-engined, low-wing [[monoplane]] light aircraft, capable of [[STOL]] (short takeoff and landing) performance. While not considered to be a highly aesthetic vehicle, the Rallye is considered to be sound and functional aircraft; efforts were made upon later-built aircraft to improve the type's visual appeal and to clean up the exterior.<ref>Trammell 1971, p. 35, 39\u201340.</ref> Composed of all metal construction, it is typically outfitted with a fixed [[tricycle landing gear]], complete with an offset free-castering nosewheel and relatively closely spaced main gear;<ref>Brechner, Berl. \"The Rallye 235 GT.\" ''AOPA Pilot'', October 1977. pp. 38\u201342.</ref><ref name = \"tram 37\"/> however, an alternative landing gear configuration is used upon the 235 C model, which was provisioned with fixed tailwheel landing gear instead. Unusually, the landing gear of the Rallye is [[Articulated vehicle|articulated]] in order to better withstand the sharp forces that are imposed during STOL landings.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/> Flying Magazine noted that the Rallye is \"a ''very'' nice-landing aircraft\".<ref name = \"tram 40\"/>\n\nThe Rallye is equipped with a [[cantilever]] wing, which incorporated interconnected full-span automatic [[leading edge slat]]s, wide-chord slotted [[aileron]]s, and wide-span [[Flap (aeronautics)#Fowler flap|Fowler]]-type [[trailing edge]] [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s. The combination of full-span slats and large Fowler flaps provided the aircraft with its capable slow-speed flight performance.<ref name = \"tram 35\"/> Fuel is also internally carried within the wings.<ref name = \"benen 68\">Benenson 1995, p. 68.</ref> According to Flying Magazine, the Rallye possessed a generous degree of controllability and was relatively forgiving to fly, being extremely difficult to mishandle to the point where effective control of the aircraft would be lost.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/> The aircraft is safe to fly at practically any piloting skill level. While the Rallye has fair manoeuvrability, such as during [[Aerobatic maneuver#Table of the basic aerobatic figure|loop]]s and [[Slow roll (aeronautics)|roll]]s, the execution of [[aerobatic maneuver]]s is not officially approved by the manufacturer.<ref name = \"tram 39 40\">Trammell 1971, pp. 39\u201340.</ref>\n\nThe aircraft's power was provided from one of a range of progressively more powerful air-cooled engines; such as the early Rallye Cub model, which was powered by a single [[Continental O-200-A]] engine, capable of generating up to {{convert|100|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, while the newer Rallye 235 variant was furnished with a [[Lycoming O-540]] engine, which provided a maximum of {{convert|235|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The method for both the ignition and run-up of the engine were relatively conventional.<ref name = \"tram 40\"/> In order to achieve a substantial increase in performance, which is useful for the execution of a STOL takeoff run, weight minimisation efforts should be made, such as carrying as little fuel and payload as is reasonably possible.<ref name = \"tram 40\"/>\n\n[[File:A\u00e9rodrome La V\u00e8ze 05.jpg|thumb|left|In-cockpit view of a Rallye, 2011]]\nThe Rallye was fitted with a bulbous cockpit, which was capable of accommodating two/three people in the basic lower-powered variants and up to four personnel within the more powerful models of the aircraft, some of which were designed to function as [[gliding|glider tug]]s and [[Aerial advertising#Fixed-wing aircraft|banner bearers]].<ref name = \"tram 39\">Trammell 1971, p. 39.</ref> The canopy slides rearwards to provide access to and from the cockpit, aided by a step located just underneath the wing's trailing edge; on the ground. On the ground, the canopy should remain slightly open when occupied to allow for adequate airflow; in flight, the canopy can be left open at speed up to a maximum of 94 knots.<ref name = \"tram 40\"/><ref name = \"benen 68\"/>\n\nThe cockpit has been described as being relatively noisy, but also often praised for the provision of excellent external visibility; Flight Magazine stated that \"It is almost like being in a four-place open cockpit plane\". Typically, the Rallye would be furnished with dual flying controls, each being complete with their own [[centre stick|control stick]], upon which controls for the [[intercom]] would be often mounted.<ref name = \"tram 40\">Trammell 1971, p. 40.</ref><ref name = \"benen 68\"/> While fully featured cockpit instrumentation was an available option to be installed upon the Rallye, the additional weight of this equipment would noticeably impact the aircraft's performance; thus, customers would have to weigh up the benefits of having superior flight performance or being able to make use of greater amount of cockpit features.<ref name = \"benen 69\">Benenson 1995, p. 69.</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===French production===\n;MS.880\n:Original production version.

It was originally developed during the 1950s by French aircraft manufacturer [[Morane-Saulnier]] as the '''MS.880'''.\n\nOn 10 June 1959, the prototype Rallye conducted the type's [[maiden flight]]; on 21 November 1961, [[type certification]] for the first production versions of the aircraft, designated as the '''MS.880B''' and more powerful '''MS.885''', was awarded. Successive models of the Rallye were developed and manufactured; changes typically involved the installation of more powerful engines, structural strengthening, and the expansion of some of the [[flight control surfaces]]. As part of efforts to access the lucrative [[North America]]n market, [[distributor]] agreements were formed with multiple US-based companies, such as the [[Waco Aircraft Company]] and [[BFA Aviation]], to market, sell, and service the Rallye. These efforts, while not being trouble-free, provided valuable sales of the type.\n\nDuring 1979, SOCATA (which Morane-Saulnier had previously merged into) decided to rename all of the Rallye series' various models, each being assigned their own individual ''[[Gaul|Gallic]]'' names. During the early 1980s, the Rallye was eventually phased out of production in France in favour of the newer [[Socata TB]] series. During December 1984, the final SOCATA-built aircraft was delivered; the entire production run had covered approximately 3,300 aircraft. However, the Rallye continued to be [[Licensed production|produced under licence]] in Poland by aviation company [[PZL]], which marketed their own models under the '''PZL Koliber''' ({{lang-en|Hummingbird}}) name. On 18 April 1978, the first flight of a prototype Koliber occurred; quantity production of the type commenced in Poland during the following year.\n\n==Development==\nDuring 1958, in response to the launch of a French government competition seeking such an aircraft, French aviation company [[Morane-Saulnier]] decided to commence work upon the design of a new single-engined light aircraft, initially designated as the ''MS.880 Rallye Club''. According to aerospace publication [[Flying (magazine)|Flying Magazine]], in comparison with other light aircraft of the era, was relatively slow-moving and cheap fixed-wing aircraft; specifically, the magazine lauded the Rallye as being available \"for a price much lower than any true [[STOL]] [short takeoff and landing], four-place aircraft\".<ref name = \"tram 35\"/> It featured a relatively simplistic design which enabled it to be provided at a highly affordable price to customers, which, along with the aircraft's capable STOL performance, was viewed as being a highly attractive selling point, particularly to customers within the [[North America]]n market.<ref name = \"tram 35\">Trammell 1971, p. 35.</ref>\n\nOn 10 June 1959, the prototype Rallye, powered by a {{convert|90|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine, conducted its [[maiden flight]]. On 21 November 1961, the first production versions of the aircraft, designated as the ''MS.880B'' and more powerful ''MS.885'', received their [[type certification]], clearing them to perform operational flights.<ref name=\"Janes 76 p64\">Taylor 1976, p. 64.</ref> Thereafter, a range of improvements and alterations were progressively made upon the design as new models of the Rallye were introduced; typical advances included the adoption of more powerful engines, improved payload capability, and strengthened structure, the addition of wheel fairings, increased ground clearance for the propeller, expanded [[rudder]] and [[aileron]]s, and changes to the cockpit canopy arrangement.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/><ref name=\"planeandpilot_1999_11_30_socata_rallye\"/> \n\nOn 19 November 1962, Morane-Saulnier filed for [[bankruptcy]], and in January 1963 was placed under the control of [[Potez]], which established the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Exploitation des Etablissements Morane-Saulnier (\"SEEMS\") to manage its assets. On 20 May 1965, Sud Aviation acquired SEEMS from Potez, forming Gerance de Etablissements Morane-Saulnier (\"GEMS\").{{sfn|Simpson|1991|p=215}} In early 1966, Sud Aviation created another new subsidiary, [[SOCATA]], to continue development and production of the Rallye series.{{sfn|Simpson|1991|p=16}} SOCATA continued to manufacture the Rallye in large numbers through the remainder of the 1960s and through the 1970s.<ref name=\"Donald world p804\"/>{{sfn|Simpson|1991|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nDuring the early 1960s, a [[distributor]] arrangement between Morane-Saulnier and the American [[Ohio]]-based [[Waco Aircraft Company]] was established regarding the marketing, sale, and servicing of the Rallye throughout the sizable and attractive [[North American]] market.<ref name = \"tram 35 37\"/> While the type was sold under the Waco name, the Rallye had little time to prove itself prior to Waco winding up its aviation activities during 1971, resulting in only a handful of aircraft being delivered under its oversight.<ref name=\"planeandpilot_1999_11_30_socata_rallye\">[http://www.planeandpilotmag.com/article/socata-rallye-waco-minerva/#.WJcSsZXnZJg \"SOCATA 'Rallye'-Waco 'Minerva',\"] 30 November 1999, ''Plane & Pilot'' Magazine, Retrieved: 5 February 2017.</ref> As a consequence of Waco's dissolution, third party aviation companies purchased the various leftover assets and continued to provide spare parts and services to American owners of the Rallye.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/>\n\nIn the late 1960s, SOCATA pursued the development of an enlarged 7-seat version powered by a {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Lycoming O-540|Lycoming IO-540-K]] engine, the ST.60 Rallye 7. Two prototypes were constructed: a version with [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable]] [[tricycle landing gear]], first flown on 3 January 1969, and an otherwise similar aircraft with fixed landing gear. However, SOCATA was not confident that a sufficient market for the aircraft existed, and no further production ensued.{{sfn|Simpson|1991|p=16}}\n\nIn the early 1970s, [[New York State|Now York]]-based company [[BFA Aviation]] was appointed as the type's new distributor within North America.<ref name = \"tram 35\"/> BFA, via several subsidiaries of its parent company Aerocon Inc, performed the final assembly of the Rallye for those sold to American customers. The use of American suppliers within the aircraft's supply chain, such as the [[Franklin 6 series|Franklin 6A-350-C1]] engine, [[Hartzell Propeller|Hartzell]] or [[McCauley Propeller Systems|McCauley]]-built propellers, wheels, brakes, and some of the cockpit instrumentation, was made upon some models of the Rallye, such as the Minerva.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/> Under the initial arrangement, US-built components would be shipped across the [[Atlantic ocean]] to reach the facilities of [[Sud Aviation]] and its subsidiary companies in France for integration onto a French-built airframe which, following completion and initial test flights, would be disassembled into sections and conveyed to BFA Aviation in the United States for final assembly and sale; efforts to reduce unnecessary shipping and thus cost were explored.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/>\n\nDuring 1979, SOCATA decided to embark upon a new production programme, one of the results of which being the renaming of the various models of Rallye series, each one receiving an individual, \"more Gallic\" name.<ref name=\"History\">\"[http://www.flyrallye.com/Rallye_History/rallye_history.html Rallye History]\".

Note the type's large tail [[fin]]]]\nSOCATA's decision to terminate production in France was not the end of all manufacturing activity for the type however. During the 1970s, SOCATA had sold a [[licensed production|license for production]] of the Rallye 100ST model to the Polish State aviation company [[PZL]], which led to the aircraft being independently constructed in its facilities in [[Warsaw]] as the ''PZL Koliber'' (''Humming Bird''). On 18 April 1978, the first PZL-built aircraft performed its maiden flight. During 1979, quantity production of the Koliber commenced; an initial batch of ten aircraft was produced that year.<ref name=\"Janes 88 p193\">Taylor 1988, p. 193.</ref>\n\nDuring February 1994, type certification of the Koliber was granted by the American [[Federal Aviation Administration]], clearing the Polish derivatives to be sold and operated within the North American market.<ref name = \"benen 67\">Benenson 1995, p. 67.</ref> Shortly thereafter, a distributor arrangement was formed with [[Cadmus Corporation]] to market and service the Koliber in the Americas. Among its uses, the aircraft proved to be a good trainer, in part due to the generous visibility provided from its cockpit and forgiving flight characteristics.<ref name = \"benen 67 68\">Benenson 1995, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Socata MS-880B Rallye Club Deurne.JPG|thumb|right|A MS.880B Rallye Club]]\nThe SOCATA Rallye is a single-engined, low-wing [[monoplane]] light aircraft, capable of [[STOL]] (short takeoff and landing) performance. While not considered to be a highly aesthetic vehicle, the Rallye is considered to be sound and functional aircraft; efforts were made upon later-built aircraft to improve the type's visual appeal and to clean up the exterior.<ref>Trammell 1971, p. 35, 39\u201340.</ref> Composed of all metal construction, it is typically outfitted with a fixed [[tricycle landing gear]], complete with an offset free-castering nosewheel and relatively closely spaced main gear;<ref>Brechner, Berl. \"The Rallye 235 GT.\" ''AOPA Pilot'', October 1977. pp. 38\u201342.</ref><ref name = \"tram 37\"/> however, an alternative landing gear configuration is used upon the 235 C model, which was provisioned with fixed tailwheel landing gear instead. Unusually, the landing gear of the Rallye is [[Articulated vehicle|articulated]] in order to better withstand the sharp forces that are imposed during STOL landings.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/> Flying Magazine noted that the Rallye is \"a ''very'' nice-landing aircraft\".<ref name = \"tram 40\"/>\n\nThe Rallye is equipped with a [[cantilever]] wing, which incorporated interconnected full-span automatic [[leading edge slat]]s, wide-chord slotted [[aileron]]s, and wide-span [[Flap (aeronautics)#Fowler flap|Fowler]]-type [[trailing edge]] [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s. The combination of full-span slats and large Fowler flaps provided the aircraft with its capable slow-speed flight performance.<ref name = \"tram 35\"/> Fuel is also internally carried within the wings.<ref name = \"benen 68\">Benenson 1995, p. 68.</ref> According to Flying Magazine, the Rallye possessed a generous degree of controllability and was relatively forgiving to fly, being extremely difficult to mishandle to the point where effective control of the aircraft would be lost.<ref name = \"tram 37\"/> The aircraft is safe to fly at practically any piloting skill level. While the Rallye has fair manoeuvrability, such as during [[Aerobatic maneuver#Table of the basic aerobatic figure|loop]]s and [[Slow roll (aeronautics)|roll]]s, the execution of [[aerobatic maneuver]]s is not officially approved by the manufacturer.<ref name = \"tram 39 40\">Trammell 1971, pp. 39\u201340.</ref>\n\nThe aircraft's power was provided from one of a range of progressively more powerful air-cooled engines; such as the early Rallye Cub model, which was powered by a single [[Continental O-200-A]] engine, capable of generating up to {{convert|100|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, while the newer Rallye 235 variant was furnished with a [[Lycoming O-540]] engine, which provided a maximum of {{convert|235|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The method for both the ignition and run-up of the engine were relatively conventional.<ref name = \"tram 40\"/> In order to achieve a substantial increase in performance, which is useful for the execution of a STOL takeoff run, weight minimisation efforts should be made, such as carrying as little fuel and payload as is reasonably possible.<ref name = \"tram 40\"/>\n\n[[File:A\u00e9rodrome La V\u00e8ze 05.jpg|thumb|left|In-cockpit view of a Rallye, 2011]]\nThe Rallye was fitted with a bulbous cockpit, which was capable of accommodating two/three people in the basic lower-powered variants and up to four personnel within the more powerful models of the aircraft, some of which were designed to function as [[gliding|glider tug]]s and [[Aerial advertising#Fixed-wing aircraft|banner bearers]].<ref name = \"tram 39\">Trammell 1971, p. 39.</ref> The canopy slides rearwards to provide access to and from the cockpit, aided by a step located just underneath the wing's trailing edge; on the ground. On the ground, the canopy should remain slightly open when occupied to allow for adequate airflow; in flight, the canopy can be left open at speed up to a maximum of 94 knots.<ref name = \"tram 40\"/><ref name = \"benen 68\"/>\n\nThe cockpit has been described as being relatively noisy, but also often praised for the provision of excellent external visibility; Flight Magazine stated that \"It is almost like being in a four-place open cockpit plane\". Typically, the Rallye would be furnished with dual flying controls, each being complete with their own [[centre stick|control stick]], upon which controls for the [[intercom]] would be often mounted.<ref name = \"tram 40\">Trammell 1971, p. 40.</ref><ref name = \"benen 68\"/> While fully featured cockpit instrumentation was an available option to be installed upon the Rallye, the additional weight of this equipment would noticeably impact the aircraft's performance; thus, customers would have to weigh up the benefits of having superior flight performance or being able to make use of greater amount of cockpit features.<ref name = \"benen 69\">Benenson 1995, p. 69.</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===French production===\n;MS.880\n:Original production version.

It held a [[royal charter]] for Bermuda until 1684, when it was dissolved, and [[the Crown]] assumed responsibility for the administration of Bermuda as a [[crown colony|royal colony]].\n\n==Bermuda under the Virginia Company==\n{{see also|Jamestown supply missions}}\n[[Image:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|\"[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]\", by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]]]]\nBermuda had been settled, inadvertently, in 1609 by the [[Virginia Company]] when its flagship, ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was wrecked on the reefs to its east.<ref>A Discovery of The Barmudas, Sylvester Jordain</ref> The Admiral of the Company, [[George Somers|Sir George Somers]], was at the helm as the ship fought a storm that had broken apart [[Third Supply|a relief fleet]] destined for [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the Virginian settlement established by the Company two years earlier.

Viking (2009) pp. 32\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe settlers and seamen spent ten months in Bermuda while they built two new ships to continue the voyage to Jamestown. During the building, ''Sea Venture'''s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent to find Jamestown. Neither it, nor its crew, was ever seen again. When [[Sea Venture|''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'']] set sail for Jamestown, they left several people behind, some to maintain Somers' claim to the islands for [[Kingdom of England|England]], some dead. Those aboard the two ships included [[Sir Thomas Gates]], the military commander and future governor of Jamestown, [[William Strachey]], whose account of the wrecking may later have inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', and [[John Rolfe]], who would found Virginia's tobacco industry, and who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda. Rolfe would find a new bride in the [[Powhatan]] princess [[Pocahontas]].\n\nJamestown, and the sixty survivors of its original five hundred settlers, were found in such a poor state that it was decided to abandon the Jamestown settlement and return everyone to England. The timely [[Jamestown supply missions|arrival of another relief fleet]] under Thomas West from England granted the colony a reprieve. However, the food shortage was made more critical by the new arrivals. Somers returned to Bermuda on ''Patience'', captained by his nephew, Matthew, to gather provisions for the Jamestown colony, but died on Bermuda in 1610. Matthew Somers was keen to receive his inheritance (Sir George and his wife were childless, but had raised his two nephews), and took ''Patience'' to Somers' hometown, [[Lyme Regis]], and not to Virginia.\n\nWhen news reached England of the adventures of ''Sea Venture'''s survivors, the royal charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include Bermuda on the 12th of March, 1612, at Westminster, with the archipelago granted by the Crown unto the ''Treasurer and Company of Aduenturers and Planters of the Cittie of London for the first colony in Virginia''. The new colony was officially named ''Virgineola'', although this was soon changed to ''The Somers Isles'' or ''The Somers Islands'' in honour of Sir George Somers.\n\nA [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]], Richard Moore, arrived in 1612 with settlers, aboard ''Plough'', to join those left behind by ''Sea Venture'' and ''Patience''. The new settlers were primarily tenant farmers, who gave seven years of indentured servitude to the Company in exchange for the cost of transport. Although the primary industry was envisioned to be agriculture, the early Governors enthusiastically, if mostly unsuccessfully, attempted to develop other industries also. These included pearl diving (there are no pearls in Bermuda) and [[ambergris]]. The first two slaves to arrive in Bermuda, one black, one Native American, were brought in for their skills as pearl divers.\n\nFree of the endemic warfare and other hardships which plagued the continental settlement, Bermuda thrived from the beginning, though it was never to be particularly profitable for its investors. Its population quickly surpassed that of Jamestown, and consideration was given to abandoning the North American continent and evacuating its settlers to Bermuda.\n\n==Formation of the Somers Isles Company==\nThe Virginia Company ran Bermuda until 1613, when the colony was transferred to Sir [[William Wade (English politician)|William Wade]] et cetera in exchange for \u00a32,000, who then resigned to the Crown in 1614. The Crown briefly adminstered the Colony directly before the adventurers (shareholders) of the Virginia Company formed a second company, the Somers Isles Company, to which Bermuda was transferred in 1615. The Virginia Company was dissolved in 1622, with the administration of its continental colony passing to [[the Crown]]. The Somers Isles Company, with its separate charter, continued to administer Bermuda for another six decades.\n\nThe original Adventurers of the Somers Isles Company listed in the letters patent were essentially the same as those of the Virginia Company. Major-General Sir [[John Henry Lefroy]], Governor of Bermuda from 1871 to 1877, transcribed the list which was ordered by social rank, but commented that the original list began with Henry, Earl of Southampton:<ref>J.

These were named for shareholders in the Company, and were further divided (by ''tribe roads'') into lots which equated to shares in the Company. The Company's return on investment came specifically from cash crops raised on that land. A ninth subdivision, now the eastern-most parish, was [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|Saint George's]], comprising [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|Saint George's Island]], [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|Saint David's Island]], part of the Main Island, and various smaller islands and islets around [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]] (then known as Southampton Harbour) and [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|Saint George's Harbour]]. This area was held as ''common'', or ''King's'' land, and was not subdivided for exploitation by the Company. This was where the capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|Saint George's Town]] was located. The choice of this location followed the original settlement created by ''Sea Venture'' survivors, and was also determined by the two eastern harbours being the only ones then readily accessible to shipping.\n\nA surveyor, [[Richard Norwood]], was hired to produce a survey of the colony, which also served as a census. This was completed in 1616, although he made later updates. In the process, he discovered that the total landmass of the eight commercial parishes was greater than originally estimated. His superior, [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], the [[Governor of Bermuda]], appropriated a choice piece of land, equivalent to the excess, for himself.\n\n==Local government==\nThe Company continued to appoint governors until its dissolution in 1684. In 1620, however, a colonial parliament was created, the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]]. Suffrage was restricted to male land owners, and there was no upper house. An appointed council, composed primarily from the leading merchant families of the Colony, came to fill a role similar to both an upper house, and a cabinet, and often proved the true repository of power in Bermuda.\n\nThe immediate concern of the first governors was for the colony's protection from a feared Spanish or Dutch attack, and the building of fortifications, and the raising of [[Bermuda Militias 1612-1815|militias]], was sustained throughout the company's administration, and beyond. A review of the colony's defences was carried out by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]].\n\n==Immigration, slavery, and demographics==\nImmigration of indentured servants continued throughout the Company's administration, and this pool of cheap labour meant that Bermuda never developed the slavery-based economy that came to characterise other English agricultural colonies. Although the bulk of the population remained [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] at the end of the 17th century, a number of minority groups were established under the Company's management. As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the Company's restraints, the local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to the sea.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[History of Bermuda]]\n* [[History of Virginia]]\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]]\n* [[Sea Venture]]\n* [[Virginia Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Roots Web [http://www.rootsweb.com/~bmuwgw/norwoodsurvey.html Richard Norwood\u2019s Survey of the Land and Landholder\u2019s of Bermuda].\n* Bermuda Yellow Pages [http://www.bermudayp.com/history.html History of Bermuda]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\n* Dan Byrnes.

Major-General Sir [[John Henry Lefroy]], Governor of Bermuda from 1871 to 1877, transcribed the list which was ordered by social rank, but commented that the original list began with Henry, Earl of Southampton:<ref>J.

These were named for shareholders in the Company, and were further divided (by ''tribe roads'') into lots which equated to shares in the Company. The Company's return on investment came specifically from cash crops raised on that land. A ninth subdivision, now the eastern-most parish, was [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|Saint George's]], comprising [[St. George's Island, Bermuda|Saint George's Island]], [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|Saint David's Island]], part of the Main Island, and various smaller islands and islets around [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]] (then known as Southampton Harbour) and [[St. George's Harbour, Bermuda|Saint George's Harbour]]. This area was held as ''common'', or ''King's'' land, and was not subdivided for exploitation by the Company. This was where the capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|Saint George's Town]] was located. The choice of this location followed the original settlement created by ''Sea Venture'' survivors, and was also determined by the two eastern harbours being the only ones then readily accessible to shipping.\n\nA surveyor, [[Richard Norwood]], was hired to produce a survey of the colony, which also served as a census. This was completed in 1616, although he made later updates. In the process, he discovered that the total landmass of the eight commercial parishes was greater than originally estimated. His superior, [[Daniel Tucker (Governor)|Daniel Tucker]], the [[Governor of Bermuda]], appropriated a choice piece of land, equivalent to the excess, for himself.\n\n==Local government==\nThe Company continued to appoint governors until its dissolution in 1684. In 1620, however, a colonial parliament was created, the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]]. Suffrage was restricted to male land owners, and there was no upper house. An appointed council, composed primarily from the leading merchant families of the Colony, came to fill a role similar to both an upper house, and a cabinet, and often proved the true repository of power in Bermuda.\n\nThe immediate concern of the first governors was for the colony's protection from a feared Spanish or Dutch attack, and the building of fortifications, and the raising of [[Bermuda Militias 1612-1815|militias]], was sustained throughout the company's administration, and beyond. A review of the colony's defences was carried out by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]].\n\n==Immigration, slavery, and demographics==\nImmigration of indentured servants continued throughout the Company's administration, and this pool of cheap labour meant that Bermuda never developed the slavery-based economy that came to characterise other English agricultural colonies. Although the bulk of the population remained [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] at the end of the 17th century, a number of minority groups were established under the Company's management. As England began to challenge Spain's supremacy in [[Florida]] and the [[West Indies]], Spanish-speaking Blacks began to emigrate from territories taken from [[Spain]]. These immigrants arrived under the same conditions of indenture as most English immigrants, but the white majority soon became uneasy with the increasing numbers of blacks. The terms of indenture for black West Indian immigrants were consequently raised successively from seven years to ninety-nine. An attempt was also made to encourage Blacks to emigrate under threat of being enslaved. Numbers of Black slaves were also being imported to Bermuda, primarily as the result of shipwrecks, or as part of the prizes taken by [[privateers]], although Bermudian vessels went as far as Africa specifically to acquire slaves. As England's settlements in [[New England]] expanded, large areas were ethnically cleansed to make way for European expansion. This resulted in various [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] peoples being shipped to Bermuda and sold into slavery, notably after the [[Pequot War]] and [[King Philip's War|Metacomet's War]]. A great many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] slaves were being brought to Bermuda by other means, also, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The third main minority group was composed of Irish [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW), and ethnically cleansed civilians, shipped to the Colony and sold into slavery following [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] bloody adventure in [[Ireland]] in the 1650s (see [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]]). Smaller numbers of Scottish POWs were also sent as a result of Cromwell's forcing his 'protectorship' on [[Scotland]].\n\nBermuda had tended towards the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] side in the [[English Civil War]], perhaps because the shareholders of the Somers Isles Company were primarily [[Nobility|nobles]], but was largely spared the effects and the aftermath of that conflict. Bermuda's [[republic]]an element, which (as in England) was largely identical to the [[Puritan]], anti-[[Episcopal polity|episcopalian]] demographic, was forced into exile, becoming the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] who began England's settlement of the [[Bahamas]] in the 1640s.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n[[File:Historic Bermuda Hog Money.png|thumb|right|Coins minted by the Sommer Isles Company]]\n[[Agriculture]] remained the mainstay of the [[Economic system|economy]] under the Somers Isles Company. The primary cash crop was [[tobacco]], but the quantity and quality produced were very poor. The [[Bermuda cedar]] boxes in which the tobacco was shipped to England were said to be worth more than their contents, and much of the tobacco was destroyed on arrival. The Colony also had little success with other export crops. Additionally, the several acres of arable land that had been cut from the forest meant that each farmer had only a very small area under cultivation, by comparison to the {{convert|50|acre|m2}} granted to each settler in Virginia. Bermudian farmers had to raise as many as three crops a year in order to be economically viable. This meant that they could not allow fields to lie fallow, and the soil, already high in [[Alkali#Alkaline soil|alkaline]] and low in [[magnesium]] (used by plants to form [[chlorophyll]]), became depleted. By the 1620s, Virginia's tobacco exports were increasing, and newer English colonies in the West Indies were also emulating Bermuda by focusing on growing tobacco for export, with the result of drastically reducing the profitability of growing tobacco for Bermudian farmers. Bermudian farmers increasingly turned to growing food crops and rearing livestock, both to reduce their dependence on overpriced imports, and to sell to other colonies. This growing trade created a need for Bermudian-owned ships to deliver their exports.\n\nBermudians began to turn away from agriculture quite early, building boats and developing the [[Bermuda sloop]] to pursue maritime trades. As the Company derived no income, except from tobacco sent to England aboard the company's magazine ships, it acted to stymie these activities. The building of vessels was banned without its license, and the first laws to protect the [[Bermuda cedar]], which were passed early in the seventeenth century, may have been intended more to restrict shipbuilding than to conserve the resource.\n\n==Civil War==\nBy the 1630s, the company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and began appointing a string of prominent Bermudians, such as [[William Sayle]], to the role. As few Adventurers actually settled in Bermuda, with their properties instead managed by poorer relatives or tenants, the local House of Assembly was necessarily elected without a property qualification, unlike the [[House of Commons of England]]. This meant it was far more concerned with the interests of the islanders, rather than the Adventurers in England. By the mid-17th century, with tobacco exports failing, many Adventurers in England eagerly cut their losses by selling their shares to the tenants who occupied. Bermudians quickly became the majority of landowners, but the Adventurers who remained in England maintained control of the Company by barring any shareholder who did not personally attend meetings in England from the decision-making process. Many of those English shareholders belonged to the [[gentry]] and anti-[[Episcopal polity|Episcopalian]] sects within the [[Church of England]], and sided with the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarians]] during the 1642-1651 [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Given the increasingly hostile relationship between Bermudians and the Company, the majority of Bermudians sided with the Crown. With control of the military forces in Bermuda as well as the Assembly, the Royalists deposed the Company appointed Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimigham in his stead. The colony's Independents, who sided with Parliament, were forced into exile, settling the [[Bahamas]] under the Cromwell-loyalist [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]].\n\nThe response of Parliament to what was characterised as the rebellion of Bermuda (and of other colonies, particularly Virginia, [[Barbados]], and [[Antigua]]) was the passage of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650. This called for ''due punishment [to be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nParliamentary privateers were authorised to act against English vessels trading with these colonies: {{lang|enm|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}{{cn|date=September 2018}} Parliament made preparations to invade the Royalist colonies, but the outbreak of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1651 was to engulf the British West Indies in war with France and Holland. A thousand miles distant, Bermuda was untouched by that war and reached a compromise with Parliament.\n\nWith the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Bermudians found they had a powerful ally in the Crown, which had its own interest in wresting control of the English Empire from corporations like the Somers Isles Company.\n\n==Revocation of charter and dissolution==\nIt was worsening interference by the Company into the livelihoods of the islanders which led to its dissolution. A protest to the Crown resulting initially from the treatment of [[Perient Trott]] and his heirs, but expanding to include the Company's wider mismanagement of the colony, was directed to the Crown. This led to a lengthy court case in which the Crown championed Bermudians against the Company. This resulted in the Company's Royal Charter being revoked in 1684, and from then on the Crown assumed responsibility for appointing the Colony's governors (it first re-appointed the last company governor). Freed of the Company's restraints, the local merchant class came to dominate and shape Bermuda's progress, as Bermudians abandoned agriculture en masse and turned to the sea.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Companies}}\n* [[History of Bermuda]]\n* [[History of Virginia]]\n* [[Jamestown, Virginia]]\n* [[List of trading companies]]\n* [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]]\n* [[Sea Venture]]\n* [[Virginia Company]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Roots Web [http://www.rootsweb.com/~bmuwgw/norwoodsurvey.html Richard Norwood\u2019s Survey of the Land and Landholder\u2019s of Bermuda].\n* Bermuda Yellow Pages [http://www.bermudayp.com/history.html History of Bermuda]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\n* Dan Byrnes.

The strip was self-aware, using [[metahumour]] extensively, and the title character, ''Checkerboard Nightmare'' (Chex) being obsessed with gaining fame as a webcomic character and willing to do anything necessary to achieve it.<ref name=\"CBR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12723|title= Killing Time with Kristofer Straub, Part 1| publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref> \n\nIn 2005, Straub began creating ''Starslip'', a daily science fiction/comedy webcomic. ''Starslip Crisis'' was first set in the [[35th century|3440]]s, aboard the [[starship]] IDS ''Fuseli'', \nnamed after painter [[bynext]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR_BzipzzuY</ref> The ''Fuseli'' was a former luxury warship which has been converted into a starship museum.

He is also a co-founder of webcomics collectives Blank Label Comics and Halfpixel. Straub and [[Scott Kurtz]] have co-created the animated series ''Blamimation with Kris and Scott'', and the live-action comedy webseries ''Kris and Scott's Scott and Kris Show'' for [[Penny Arcade]]'s ''PATV''. \n\nHe currently hosts the podcast ''28 Plays Later'' alongside [[Paul Verhoeven (broadcaster)|Paul Verhoeven]]. Straub also manages and writes for the horror fiction site Ichor Falls, which is notable for the [[List of Internet phenomena#Creepypasta|creepypasta]] ''[[Candle Cove]]'', and creates YouTube videos for his horror anthology channel, ''[[Local 58]]''. \n\n==Career==\n\n===As a cartoonist===\nStraub launched his first comic, ''Checkerboard Nightmare'', online in 2000. The strip was self-aware, using [[metahumour]] extensively, and the title character, ''Checkerboard Nightmare'' (Chex) being obsessed with gaining fame as a webcomic character and willing to do anything necessary to achieve it.<ref name=\"CBR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12723|title= Killing Time with Kristofer Straub, Part 1| publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref> \n\nIn 2005, Straub began creating ''Starslip'', a daily science fiction/comedy webcomic. ''Starslip Crisis'' was first set in the [[35th century|3440]]s, aboard the [[starship]] IDS ''Fuseli'', \nnamed after painter [[bynext]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR_BzipzzuY</ref> The ''Fuseli'' was a former luxury warship which has been converted into a starship museum. It is still capable of military activities. The ''Fuseli'' travelled from system to system with its exhibits (using a [[faster than light]] \"starslip drive\"), the comic chronicling the adventures of the crew. Much of the art featured upon the ''Fuseli'' dated from the 20th or 21st centuries.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.starslip.com/archive/20050524.shtml \n |title=Starslip \u2013 Tuesday, May 24, 2005 \n |date=2005-05-24 \n |author=Kris Straub \n |accessdate=2008-02-08 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724121154/http://www.starslip.com/archive/20050524.shtml \n |archivedate=July 24, 2009 \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.starslip.com/archive/20051116.shtml \n |title=Starslip \u2013 Wednesday, November 16, 2005 \n |date=2005-11-16 \n |author=Kris Straub \n |accessdate=2008-02-08 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514083020/http://www.starslip.com/archive/20051116.shtml \n |archivedate=May 14, 2009 \n}}</ref>\n''Starslip Crisis'' was part of the webcomics cooperation collective Blank Label Comics,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/article_brief/eandp/1/1000939106\n|title=Blank Label Comics is Formed\n|date=2005-05-31\n|publisher=[[Editor & Publisher]]\n|accessdate=2008-02-08\n}}</ref> until Straub split away from Blank Label to merge Starslip with his new collective,  Halfpixel,  in November 2007.<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.halfpixel.com/2007/11/01/three-cartoonists-leave-blank-label-comics-to-form-new-halfpixel/\n |title      = Three Cartoonists Leave Blank Label Comics to Form New Halfpixel\n |date       = 2007-11-01\n |publisher  = Halfpixel\n |accessdate = 2008-02-08\n}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe comic initially ran under the name ''Starshift Crisis''. The nearly identical ''Starslip Crisis'' appeared early in the strip's run, with its own website and associated content, differing only in that the term \"starslip\" replaced \"starshift\". The two ran in parallel, until a strip in August 2005 which definitively ended the plot of ''Starshift Crisis'', but which played out differently in ''Starslip Crisis''. Reportedly the name change was caused by a legal issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comixtalk.com/starshift_crisis_changes_its_name|title=Starshift Crisis Changes Its Name?|publisher=Comixtalk|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Writer and producer===\nIn December 2006, Straub was named co-writer and co-producer alongside [[Scott Kurtz]] on PvP: The Series, a series of animated shorts featuring the [[PvP]] characters. In 2007, to coincide with his move to Dallas, Straub repurposed the ''Halfpixel'' site to serve as a hub for his and Kurtz's joint creative projects. ''Halfpixel'' later expanded to include webcartoonists [[Brad Guigar]] and [[Dave Kellett]] of the comics [[Evil Inc.]] and [[Sheldon (webcomic)|Sheldon]], respectively. The four published ''How To Make Webcomics'' through [[Image Comics]] in the first quarter of 2008. The book covers a variety of topics of interest for beginning and intermediate webcartoonists.<ref name=\"htmw\">[http://drawn.ca/2008/04/06/how-to-make-webcomics/ Drawn.ca review of ''How To Make Webcomics'']</ref>\n\nStraub went on to co-produced ''Blamimation'' and the ''Kris and Scott\u2019s Scott and Kris Show'' for Penny Arcade TV. In 2012, [[ShiftyLook]] announced that Straub and Kurtz were co-producing a new animated web series, ''[[Mappy#Web series|Mappy: The Beat]]'', in which they also voice all the characters. The series premiered in July 2013 and aired for 13 episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/23405.html|title=ShiftyLook Announces First 2 Animated Series|publisher=icv2|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nStraub manages and writes for his own horror fiction website ''Ichor Falls'', which features his most notable work of short fiction, ''Candle Cove''. Straub's original short story is in the form of a series of [[Internet forum|forum posts]] by people reminiscing about a children's show called ''Candle Cove''. Although it seems at first to be a normal children's program, they gradually recall disturbing aspects of the program and a bizarre episode in particular, before discovering that ''Candle Cove'' was merely half an hour of TV static which the children believed was a program.<ref name=\"Candle Cove\">[http://www.ichorfalls.com/2009/03/15/candle-cove/ Candle Cove] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203232817/http://www.ichorfalls.com/2009/03/15/candle-cove/ |date=2012-12-03 }}, Kris Straub</ref>\n\n===Podcast host===\nStraub has co-hosted numerous podcasts, most of which center around the online comic industry, daily life, or comedy talk shows.\n\nIn 2005, while part of the comic collective ''Blank Label Comics,'' Straub and [[Dave Kellett]] co-hosted the ''Blank Label Comics Podcast''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalstrips.com/2005/09/news-blank-label-comics-launches.html|title=Blank Label Comics Launches Podcast|publisher=Digital Strips|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref> The podcast interviewed fellow webcomic creators about their comics and creative process. \n\nIn 2007, leading up to the release of ''How To Make Webcomics'', Straub - alongside the books co-authors, [[Scott Kurtz]], [[Brad Guigar]], and [[Dave Kellett]] - produced the podcast ''Webcomics Weekly''.<ref name=\"ww\">[http://ww.libsyn.com/ Webcomics Weekly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501232751/http://ww.libsyn.com/ |date=2013-05-01 }}</ref> The show featured comic industry news, techniques and general advice on how to create and maintain a successful comic online.

Berg reorganized the movement amid reports of serious misconduct and financial mismanagement, The Chain's abuse of authority, and disagreements within it about the continued use of [[Flirty Fishing]]. The group was also accused of sexually abusing and raping minors within the organization, with considerable evidence to support this claim.  One-eighth of the total membership left the movement. Those who remained became part of a reorganized movement called the Family of Love, and later, The Family.

Flirty Fishing was practiced by members of Berg's inner circle starting in 1973, and was introduced to the general membership in 1976 and became common practice within the group. In some areas flirty fishers used escort agencies to meet potential converts. According to TFI  \"over 100,000 received God's gift of salvation through Jesus, and some chose to live the life of a disciple and [[missionary]]\" as a result of Flirty Fishing.<ref name=Origins /> Researcher Bill Bainbridge obtained data from TFI suggesting that, from 1974 until 1987, members had sexual contact with 223,989 people while practicing Flirty Fishing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bainbridge |first=William Sims |year=1996 |title=The Sociology of Religious Movements |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-91202-0 |page=223}}</ref>\n\n=== The Family (1982\u20131994) ===\nIn March 1989, TF issued a statement that, in \"early 1985\", an urgent memorandum had been sent to all members \"reminding them that any such activities [adult\u2013child sexual contact] are ''strictly forbidden'' within our group\" (emphasis in original), and such activities were grounds for immediate [[excommunication]] from the group.<ref name=\"Child Abuse?!\">{{cite web |url=http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Child_Abuse%3F%21 |title=Child Abuse?! |website=XFamily |date=2008-01-24 |accessdate=2016-07-24}}</ref> In January 2005, Claire Borowik, a spokesperson for TFI, stated that:<blockquote>[d]ue to the fact that our current zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual interaction between adults and underage minors was not in our literature published before 1986, we came to the realization that during a transitional stage of our movement, from 1978 until 1986, there were cases when some minors were subject to sexually inappropriate advances&nbsp;...

According to TFI beliefs, this passage refers to keys that were hidden and unused in the centuries that followed, but were again revealed through Karen Zerby as more power to pray and obtain miracles. TFI members call on the various Keys of the Kingdom for extra effect during prayer.

But they take bridal theology further, encouraging members to imagine Jesus is joining them during [[sexual intercourse]] and [[masturbation]]. Male members are cautioned to visualize themselves as women, in order to avoid a homosexual relationship with Jesus.

Berg reorganized the movement amid reports of serious misconduct and financial mismanagement, The Chain's abuse of authority, and disagreements within it about the continued use of [[Flirty Fishing]]. The group was also accused of sexually abusing and raping minors within the organization, with considerable evidence to support this claim.  One-eighth of the total membership left the movement. Those who remained became part of a reorganized movement called the Family of Love, and later, The Family.

Flirty Fishing was practiced by members of Berg's inner circle starting in 1973, and was introduced to the general membership in 1976 and became common practice within the group. In some areas flirty fishers used escort agencies to meet potential converts. According to TFI  \"over 100,000 received God's gift of salvation through Jesus, and some chose to live the life of a disciple and [[missionary]]\" as a result of Flirty Fishing.<ref name=Origins /> Researcher Bill Bainbridge obtained data from TFI suggesting that, from 1974 until 1987, members had sexual contact with 223,989 people while practicing Flirty Fishing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bainbridge |first=William Sims |year=1996 |title=The Sociology of Religious Movements |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-91202-0 |page=223}}</ref>\n\n=== The Family (1982\u20131994) ===\nIn March 1989, TF issued a statement that, in \"early 1985\", an urgent memorandum had been sent to all members \"reminding them that any such activities [adult\u2013child sexual contact] are ''strictly forbidden'' within our group\" (emphasis in original), and such activities were grounds for immediate [[excommunication]] from the group.<ref name=\"Child Abuse?!\">{{cite web |url=http://www.xfamily.org/index.php/Child_Abuse%3F%21 |title=Child Abuse?! |website=XFamily |date=2008-01-24 |accessdate=2016-07-24}}</ref> In January 2005, Claire Borowik, a spokesperson for TFI, stated that:<blockquote>[d]ue to the fact that our current zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual interaction between adults and underage minors was not in our literature published before 1986, we came to the realization that during a transitional stage of our movement, from 1978 until 1986, there were cases when some minors were subject to sexually inappropriate advances&nbsp;...

According to TFI beliefs, this passage refers to keys that were hidden and unused in the centuries that followed, but were again revealed through Karen Zerby as more power to pray and obtain miracles.

{"title_page": "Online dispute resolution", "text_new": "{{Alternative dispute resolution}}\n{{about|dispute resolution techniques|the C++ programming language rule|One Definition Rule}}\n'''Online dispute resolution''' ('''ODR''') is a branch of [[dispute resolution]] which uses technology to facilitate the resolution of disputes between parties. It primarily involves [[negotiation]], [[mediation]] or [[arbitration]], or a combination of all three. In this respect it is often seen as being the online equivalent of [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR).<ref>Arthur M. Monty Ahalt, [http://files.ali-aba.org/thumbs/datastorage/lacidoirep/articles/PLIT0903_Ahalt_thumb.pdf What You Should Know About Online Dispute Resolution].</ref> However, ODR can also augment these traditional means of resolving disputes by applying innovative techniques and online technologies to the process.\n\nODR is a wide field, which may be applied to a range of disputes; from interpersonal disputes including consumer to consumer disputes (C2C) or marital separation; to court disputes and interstate conflicts.<ref>National Centre for Technology and Dispute Resolution, Standards of Practice. See <www.odr.info>.</ref> It is believed that efficient mechanisms to resolve online disputes will impact in the development of e-commerce. While the application of ODR is not limited to disputes arising out of business to consumer (B2C) online transactions, it seems to be particularly apt for these disputes, since it is logical to use the same medium (the internet) for the resolution of e-commerce disputes when parties are frequently located far from one another.<ref>L. Bygrave, \"Online Dispute Resolution- What it Means for Consumers\". Paper presented at a conference entitled 'Domain Name Systems and Internet Governance' Grace Hotel, Sydney, (7 May 2002) p. 2.</ref>\n\n== Definition ==\n\nDispute resolution techniques range from methods where parties have full control of the procedure, to methods where a third party is in control of both the process and the outcome.<ref>C. Rule, Online Dispute Resolution for Businesses. B2B, E-Commerce, Consumer, Employment, Insurance, and Other Commercial Conflicts (San Francisco, Jossey Bass, 2002) p. 37.</ref> These primary methods of resolving disputes may be complemented with [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT).<ref name=\"Cortes_2009\">P. Cortes, \"A European Legal Perspective on Consumer Online Dispute Resolution\" (2009) 15(4)''Computer Telecommunications Law Review'' pp. 90-100.</ref> When the process is conducted mainly online it is referred to as ODR, i.e. to carry out most of the dispute resolution procedure online, including the initial filing, the neutral appointment, evidentiary processes, oral hearings if needed, online discussions, and even the rendering of binding settlements. Thus, ODR is a different medium to resolve disputes, from beginning to end, respecting due process principles.<ref>J. A. Garc\u00eda \u00c1lvaro, \"Online Dispute Resolution Uncharted Territory\" (2003) 7 The Vindobona Journal of International Commercial Law and Arbitration P. 180.</ref>\n\nODR was born from the synergy between ADR and ICT, as a method for resolving disputes that were arising online, and for which traditional means of dispute resolution were inefficient or unavailable.<ref name=\"Katsh_Rifkin\">E. Katsh, and J. Rifkin, J. Online Dispute Resolution: Resolving Conflicts in Cyberspace (San Francisco, Jossey-Bass, 2001).</ref>{{rp|9}} The introduction of ICT in dispute resolution is currently growing to the extent that the difference between off-line dispute resolution and ODR is blurry. It has been observed that it is only possible to distinguish between proceedings that rely heavily on online technology and proceedings that do not.<ref>J. H\u00f6rnle, \"Online Dispute Resolution: the Emperor's New Clothes\" (2003) 17(1) International Review of Law, Computers & Technology 27. See Cf. J. H\u00f6rnle, Cross-Border Internet Dispute Resolution (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2009).</ref> Some commentators have defined ODR exclusively as the use of ADR assisted principally with ICT tools. Although part of the doctrine incorporates a broader approach including online litigation and other sui generis forms of dispute resolution when they are assisted largely by ICT tools designed ad hoc.<ref>A. Lodder, \"The Third Party and Beyond. An Analysis of the Different Parties, in Particular The Fifth, Involved in Online Dispute Resolution\" (2006) 15 (2) Information and Communications Technology Law p. 144. G. Kaufmann-Kohler and T. Schultz, Online Dispute Resolution: Challenges for Contemporary Justice (2004) p. 5.</ref> The latter definition seems more appropriate since it incorporates all methods used to resolve disputes that are conducted mainly through the use of ICT.<ref>P. Cortes, Online Dispute Resolution for Consumers in the European Union (Routledge, 2010)</ref> Moreover, this concept is more consistent with the fact that ODR was born from the distinction with off-line dispute resolution processes.<ref>T. Schultz, \"An Essay on the Role of Government for ODR. Theoretical Considerations about the Future of ODR\" (2003) August ADROnline Monthly p. 6.</ref>\n\nIn ODR, the information management is not only carried out by physical persons but also by computers and software. The assistance of ICT has been named by Katsh and Rifkin as the 'fourth party' because ODR is seen as an independent input to the management of the dispute.<ref name=\"Katsh_Rifkin\"/>{{rp|93\u2013117}} In addition to the two (or more) disputants and the third neutral party, the labelling of technology as the fourth party is a clear metaphor which stresses how technology can be as powerful as to change the traditional three side model. The fourth party embodies a range of capabilities in the same manner that the third party does. While the fourth party may at times take the place of the third party, i.e. automated negotiation, it will frequently be used by the third party as a tool for assisting the process.<ref name=\"Katsh_Wing\">E. Katsh and Wing, \"Ten Years of Online Dispute Resolution (ODR): Looking at the Past and Constructing the Future\" 38 (2006) U. Tol. L. Rev. p. 31</ref><ref>A.

In addition, it can monitor performance, schedule meetings, clarify interests and priorities, and so on.<ref name=\"Katsh_Rifkin\"/>{{rp|129}} The assistance of the fourth party will increase the more technology advances, thus reducing the role of the third neutral party. It has been predicted that virtual \"fourth party\" avatars will be created to judge disputes and could become more skilled and intelligent over time.<ref>Ethan Katsh, Bringing Online Dispute Resolution to Virtual Worlds: Creating Processes Through Code, 1 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 271, 286 (2005)</ref> Katsh and Wing argue that ICT advance is occurring exponentially since ICT advance speeds up over the time.<ref name=\"Katsh_Wing\"/>{{rp|27}} As a result, ODR processes are increasing in efficiency providing their disputants with greater advantages in terms of time saving and cost reductions.\n\n=== Alternative definitions ===\n\nIn practice it is difficult to provide a self-contained definition of ODR, and given the pace of change it may not even be possible to do so. The use of technology usually involves the use of Internet-based communications technology at some stage, but ODR does not necessarily involve purely online processes \u2013 further, many could be replicated offline using pen and paper, or could be achieved using computers without Internet connections.\n\nThe range of terms and [[wiktionary:acronym|acronym]]s used to describe the field augments the confusion often felt by those unfamiliar with the new field of ODR. These terms include:\n\n*Internet Dispute Resolution (iDR)\n*Electronic Dispute Resolution (eDR)\n*Electronic ADR (eADR)\n*Online ADR (oADR)\n\nODR has emerged as the most used term in recent years.\n\nIt is uncertain whether these processes form a new ''discipline'' of ADR or a ''tool'' to aid existing methods of dispute resolution. The most appropriate view would be to view ODR as an [[wiktionary:interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary]] field of dispute resolution.\n\n== Methods ==\n\n=== Consensual ===\n\n====Automated negotiation====\n\nAutomated negotiation relates to those methods in which the technology takes over (aspects of) a negotiation. Most of the ODR services in this area are so-called 'blind-bidding' services. This is a negotiation process designed to determine economic settlements for claims in which liability is not challenged. The blind bidding service may be thought of as a type of auction mechanism where some or all information about the players' bids is hidden. There are two forms of automated negotiation, double blind bidding, which is a method for single monetary issues between two parties, and Visual Blind Bidding, which can be applied to negotiations with any number of parties and issues.\n\n* ''Double Blind Bidding''\n\nDouble blind bidding is a negotiation method for two parties where the offer and demand are kept hidden during the negotiation. It commences when one party invites the other to negotiate the amount of money in dispute. If the other party agrees, they start a blind bidding process whereby both parties make secret offers or bids, which will only be disclosed if both offers match certain standards. They can usually submit up to three offers and if the bids of both parties come within a predetermined range (usually range from 30% to 5%) or a given amount of money (e.g. \u20ac3,000), then the technology automatically settles the dispute in the midpoint of the two offers. Although, it is a simple method, it effectively encourages the parties to reveal their 'bottom line' offers and demands, splitting the difference when the amounts are close.\n\n* ''Visual blind bidding''\n\nThe primary distinction of visual blind bidding is in what is kept hidden from the other parties. In traditional double blind bidding, the offers and demands are kept hidden, whereas with visual blind bidding what is kept hidden is what each party is willing to accept. This method can be effectively applied to the simplest single-value negotiations or the most complex negotiations between any number of parties and issues.<ref>E. Thiessen, \"Description of Visual Blind Bidding\", (Smartsettle, 2019), available at https://smartsettle.com/products/smartsettle-one/smartsettles-visual-blind-bidding/</ref>\n\nVisual blind bidding commences when all parties agree to negotiate with one another. They start the process by exchanging visible optimistic proposals, which define negotiating ranges. The system then generates suggestions that fall within the negotiating ranges. Parties may continue to exchange visible proposals or contribute their own suggestions to the mix. Suggestions contributed by the parties remain anonymous, thus avoiding the face saving problem of accepting a suggestion made by another party.<ref>E. Thiessen et al., \"Rewarding Good Negotiating Behaviour with Smartsettle\", (Smartsettle, 2019), available at https://smartsettle.com/2019/07/12/rewarding-good-negotiating-behavour/</ref>\n\nA resolution is declared by the system at the end of a negotiating session if all parties have accepted one or more packages (of one or more proposed decision values) at the end of that session. Which of those packages becomes the agreement may be determined by an algorithm that rewards the party that moves soonest into the Zone of Agreement. This algorithm is thought to encourage concessions and quickly indicate that they are willing to accept a fair outcome. This is in contrast to the chilling effect that occurs with the more common split-the-difference algorithm.<ref>D. Larson, \"Artificial Intelligence: Robots, Avatars, and the Demise of the Human Mediator\", Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution [Vol. 25:1 2010], available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1461712</ref>\n\nAutomated negotiation has proven to be particularly successful with insurance compensations and commercial activities. It is also a valuable tool for lawyers because they too can use it without revealing what they're willing to accept (unless an agreement is reached) and more importantly, without waiving their right to access the court, in the case that the negotiation is unsuccessful.\n\nThus, ODR is useful for resolving brick and mortar disputes that arise in businesses, insurance companies and municipalities, who are finding that ODR saves them money and time when dealing with B2C disputes.<ref>J. Krause \"Settling it on the Web. New Technology, Lower Costs Enable Growth of Online Dispute Resolution\" ''American Bar Association Journal'', October 2007</ref>\n\n====Assisted negotiation====\n\nIn assisted negotiation the technology assists the negotiation process between the parties. The technology has a similar role as the mediator in a mediation. The role of the technology may be to provide a certain process and/or to provide the parties with specific (evaluative) advice.\n\nMediators use information management skills encouraging parties to reach an amicable agreement by enabling them to communicate more effectively through the rephrasing of their arguments. Conciliation is similar to mediation, but the conciliator can propose solutions for the parties to consider before an agreement is reached. Also, assisted negotiation procedures are designed to improve parties' communications through the assistance of a third party or software. In fact, it has been argued that assisted negotiation, conciliation, and even facilitation, are just different words for mediation.<ref>P. Jacobs \"Mediation Now and Then\" in M. P. Barbee, Newsletter, Mediation, International Bar Association Legal Practice Division, July 2007, p.14.</ref> The major advantages of these processes, when used online, are their informality, simplicity and user friendliness.<ref>Motion P. \"Article 17 ECD: Encouragement of Alternative Dispute Resolution. On-line Dispute Resolution: A View from Scotland\" ''The New Legal Framework for E-Commerce in Europe'' (Oregon and Portland, Hart Publishing, 2005) p. 145</ref>\n\n* ''SquareTrade''\n\nThe leading ODR provider for consumer mediation was until recently [[SquareTrade]]. It was contracted by a number of market places, the largest of which was [[eBay]]. However, due to changes in the eBay feedback system in May 2008, SquareTrade decided to stop resolving eBay feedback disputes from June 2008.<ref>SquareTrade \"ODR Is No Longer Offered by SquareTrade\" <http://www.squaretrade.com/pages/odr-discontinued>.</ref> SquareTrade continues providing services to eBay users, such as warranty services and the trustmark program. It appears that in the last year these services have been taken over by eBay and [[PayPal]] dispute resolution services, but results on these services are still scarce.\n\nSquareTrade did not handle disputes between users and eBay, only between sellers and buyers on eBay. SquareTrade offered two levels of dispute resolution: assisted negotiation and mediation. SquareTrade was only used after eBay's own consumer satisfaction process. In the last few years, SquareTrade has resolved millions of disputes across 120 countries in 5 different languages.<ref name=\"Abernethy\">S. Abernethy \"Building Large-Scale Online Dispute Resolution and Trustmark Systems\" Proceedings of the UNECE Forum on ODR 2003, Available at <http://www.odr.info/unece2003>.</ref><ref>See also <http://www.squaretrade.com> (About us) (Last visited, April 2008).</ref>\n\nThe advantage of dealing with large number of disputes is that the same issues arise many times, thus it is possible to divide the disputes into different sections. The SquareTrade process started when a buyer or a seller filed a complaint. To do so, the claimant was asked to fill out a web-based standard claim form that identified the type of dispute and presented a list of common solutions, from which the claimant selected the ones that he agreed to. The other party was contacted by email where he was informed about the SquareTrade process, and asked whether he wished to participate. The parties were often keen on participating because this was the only manner by which the buyer could get redress and the seller positive feedback. The other party filed the response, selecting the resolutions. If both parties agreed on the same resolution, the dispute was resolved. When an agreement could not be reached, parties were put into a negotiation environment. A web interface was used to shape communications into a constructive and polite negotiation. This was achieved with software tools that limited the free text space, encouraged the proposition of agreements, set deadlines and even shaped the tone of exchanges.\n\nThis software was the key element of the process because it took over some of the expertise of the third party. This process could be defined as 'mediated negotiation'. According to Rabinovich-Einy, SquareTrade technology,\n\n\"intervenes in the negotiations between the parties and, by allowing parties to formulate and reformulate the problem and the solution, performs some of what would be associated with a mediator's role, moving the parties from a problem mode to a solution stance.\"<ref>O. Rabinovich-Einy \"Technology's Impact: The Quest for a New Paradigm for Accountability in Mediation\" (2006) 11 ''Harvard Negotiation Law Review'' 258.</ref>\n\nMost disputes (over 80 percent) were resolved during the first two stages, which was an impressive success rate given that in the majority of cases, the parties had already been involved in some type of failed direct negotiation before engaging with SquareTrade.<ref>85 percent of cases are settled through the use of facilitated negotiation. Cf. M. Conley Tyler and Di Bretherton, \"Seventy-Six and Counting: An Analysis of ODR Sites\" Proceedings of the UNECE Forum on ODR 2003.</ref> In the rest of the cases a mediator could be requested for a nominal fee, acting as an expert evaluator or conciliator that made settlement proposals to the parties. This second stage involved the payment of a US$29.95 fee. According to SquareTrade, \"[a] sophisticated case management technology enables mediators to handle lower to medium-value consumer disputes in an efficient cost effective manner.\"<ref name=\"Abernethy\"/>{{rp|2}} The appointed mediator proposed solutions, if required by the parties to do so. Agreements were always kept confidential by SquareTrade, and became binding as contracts.\n\nSquareTrade has proven that processes such as online negotiation and online mediation can be efficient tools to resolve e-commerce disputes. One of the key issues for the success of SquareTrade was the simplicity and convenience of this service. In addition, SquareTrade services to eBay were concentrated on a reduced number of issues, such as delays, bad descriptions and negative feedback. This made possible the development of an efficient automatic process that enhanced online negotiation. The success of consensual and automated processes depends on the nature of the dispute, the accuracy of information provided, and the capability of the software or the third neutral party in assessing and evaluating the facts and evidence. SquareTrade was particularly effective because it introduced incentives that encourage parties' participation; i.e. both parties wished to resolve their dispute: sellers want to obtain positive feedback and buyers want redress. In general terms, widening the scope of clients' claims to the global market invites extra variables to play: cultural differences, such as high and low culture perceptions and the cross-cultural variations of what constitutes the customer satisfaction experience.<ref>Femenia, Nora, Paper presented at the Joint Conference of the OECD, HCOPIL, ICC, The Hague, the Netherlands, December 12, 2000: \"ODR And The Global Management Of Customers' Complaints: How Can ODR Techniques Be Responsive To Different Social And Cultural Environments?\"http://www.mediate.com//articles/femenia.cfm</ref>\n\n====Expedient Non-Adjudicative Online Resolution====\n\nAnother form of alternative dispute resolution prioritizes expedience and dispenses with adjudication all together, in recognition of the litigants' desire to simply dispose of the matter as quickly as possible. By removing any hint of adjudication, services (e.g., One Day Decisions) \"fast track\" a version similar to blind bidding which is restricted privately to the two parties and an algorithm determines a fair value to be accepted by each party. Unlike other services, once accepted by both parties, the settlement amount is applied to the issuance of a Certificate of Final Resolution which both parties accept as irrevocable proof of resolution and final settlement. By avoiding adjudication, expedient non-adjudicative online resolution saves litigants time in court, time away from work and other fees and expenses, while protecting each from ancillary damage: The winning party generally collects more of his disputed amount and the losing party suffers no credit damage from having a judgment entered against him. Expedient Non-Adjudicative Online Resolution is generally utilized in cases that might otherwise be heard in small claims or limited civil matters.\n\n====Crowdjustice====\n\nAs an alternative to private, professional settlement, the concept of crowdjustice has recently taken shape as a means to leverage social norms and the wisdom of crowds<ref>Surowiecki, James (2005). ''[[The Wisdom of Crowds]]''. Anchor Books. pp. xv. {{ISBN|0-385-72170-6}}.</ref> to determine the outcome of a dispute. \n\n=== Adjudicative ===\n\n====Online arbitration====\n\nArbitration is a process where a neutral third party (arbitrator) delivers a decision which is final, and binding on both parties. It can be defined as a quasi-judicial procedure because the award replaces a judicial decision. Arbitrators can be current or former trial judges, but that is not a requirement. However, in an arbitration procedure parties usually can choose the arbitrator and the basis on which the arbitrator makes the decision. Furthermore, it is less formal than litigation, though more than any other consensual process. It is often used to resolve businesses' disputes because this procedure is noted for being private and faster than litigation. Once the procedure is initiated parties cannot abandon it, unless they both agree to discontinuing it (e.g. when they reached a settlement - although usually the settlement will be communicated to the arbitral tribunal and an award rendered on this basis). Another feature of arbitration is that the award is enforceable almost everywhere due to the wide adoption of the 1958 [[New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards]].<ref>The New York Convention has currently more than 150 signatories. See <http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration.html> Cf. J. M.

Cross examination of remote witnesses regulated by the arbitrator can ensure the fairness and maintain a judicial quality for the online arbitration process.<ref>[http://online-arbitration.com online-arbitration.com]</ref>\n\nThe main challenge for online arbitration is that if judicial enforcement is required then it partly defeats the purpose of having an online process. Alternatively, some processes have developed self-enforcement mechanisms such as technical enforcements, black lists and trustmarks.\n\n====The Uniform Domain Names Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP)====\n\nTraditionally arbitration resolves disputes by delivering a decision that will be legally binding, i.e. enforceable by the courts in the same manner as a judgment. Non binding arbitration processes may also be effective when using ODR tools because they often encourage settlements by imparting a dose of reality and objectivity.<ref>t. Stipanowich, \"The Arbitration Penumbra: Arbitration Law and the Rapidly Changing Landscape of Dispute Resolution\" ''Legal Studies Working Paper Series'', Paper Number 2008/1, 30 Nevada Law Journal, Forthcoming. Available at <http://ssrn.com/abstract=1007490>.</ref> In addition, self-enforcement measures may reinforce the efficacy of non binding processes. The most significant example is the [[Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP) created by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). Some commentators have referred to the UDRP as an administrative process. In any case, the UDRP has developed a transparent global ODR process that allows trade mark owners to fight efficiently cybersquatting. The UDRP is used to resolve disputes between trade mark owners and those who have registered a domain name in bad faith for the purpose of reselling it for a profit, or taking advantage of the reputation of a trademark.\n\nTrademark owners accessing the UDRP must prove to the panel three circumstances: \n#similarity of the domain name to the trade or service mark;\n#lack of rights or legitimate interest in the registered domain name;\n#bad faith in the registration and use of the domain name.\n\nHowever, the UDRP presents its own problems that show the challenges that an online adversarial system applied to mainstream e-commerce disputes would have. The main worry is that the evaluation of the panel decisions often shows a lack of unanimous consensus in the interpretation of the UDRP.<ref>WIPO, Overview of WIPO Panel Views on Selected UDRP Questions. This case study is based on the evaluation of 7,000 WIPO panel decisions published in February 2005. Available at <http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/>.</ref> This may be due to a number of reasons, such as the lack of an appellative review and panels composed by members from a multitude of jurisdictions and informed by different legal traditions.\n\nOn the other side, it is undeniable what ICANN with the UDRP has achieved in developing an effective ODR procedure based on contractual adherence that allows trade mark owners to transfer or cancel a domain that blatantly violates IP rights. The UDRP providers have dealt efficiently with over 30,000 domain name disputes. Their success derives from two aspects: First, the UDRP deals only with blatant disputes, which are abusive registrations made in bad faith in order to take advantage of the reputation of existing trademarks. Secondly, it has incorporated a self-enforcement mechanism, which transfers and cancels domain names without the need for judicial involvement. This is a positive accomplishment for the development of e-commerce because it favours consumers' confidence in the Internet by reducing the number of fraudulent registered domain names.\n\n====Chargebacks====\n\nOne of the main focuses of e-commerce up until recently has been related to secure payments. [[Chargebacks]] is a remedy used to reverse transactions made with credit or debit cards when a fraudulent use has occurred, or when there is a violation of the contract terms. This method is very popular among online consumers since this is the main mechanism to transfer money online. In addition, consumers are not required to give evidence to cancel a payment. The vendor has the burden of proving that the merchandise or service was given according to the contract terms. Once this is proved the bank makes effective the payment to the vendor.\n\nChargebacks are largely used around the world by banks and the main credit card suppliers i.e. Visa, MasterCard and American Express. Yet, the coverage of debit and credit cards varies considerably amongst different countries.<ref>S. Andrews, OECD Workshop on Consumer Dispute Resolution and Redress in the Global Marketplace, Background Project, 19 April 2005, p.9 and OECD report on Consumer Dispute Resolution and Redress in the Global Marketplace, published 11 April 2006. p.12-16 Available at <http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/26/61/36456184.pdf>.</ref> Commonly, debit cardholders have fewer protections than credit card holders, but it also varies depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nIt is then not surprising why credit cards are the major source of payments for consumers in e-commerce. They provide a remedy that reverses all transactions when a fraudulent use has occurred, or when there is a violation of the contract terms. However this method has limitations; it offers one single remedy (the return of the payment), and not all disputes imply a breach of contract or fraud.\n\nSimilarly, online payment providers, like PayPal.com, retain temporarily the money paid by a buyer when the latter makes a complaint within 45 days after the payment was made. PayPal.com holds the money until the dispute is settled, but only in those cases where the merchandise did not arrive, or the description of the product was significantly different from the product itself.<ref>See Seller Protection Policies in <www.paypal.com>.</ref> In these circumstances PayPal.com acts akin to an online arbitrator.<ref>I. Col\u00f3n-Fung, \"Protecting the New Face of Entrepreneurship: Online Appropriate Dispute Resolution and International Consumer-to-Consumer Online Transactions\" 12 (2007) ''Fordham Journal of Corporate and Financial Law'' p. 256.</ref> However, in those circumstances where the seller takes away the money from his account before the buyer makes the claim, PayPal.com will not be responsible for the buyer's loss. Despite this, PayPal is in a very strong position since in most cases it is able to freeze the amount of money and resolve the dispute providing an instant and effective enforcement.\n\nOverall, chargebacks intends to balance the inequality of power between consumers and businesses. It is regarded as a very efficient tool for consumers because the speed, accessibility and lack of charge for their clients, who would just have to notify their banks or card issuers to cancel a transaction. Thus, Edwards and Wilson suggested that it would be advisable to focus on developing chargebacks and other soft ODR methods because they are very effective amongst mainstream consumers.<ref>L. Edwards, & C. Wilson, 'Redress and Alternative Dispute Resolution in EU Cross-Border E-Commerce Transactions ', (2007) 21(3) ''International Review of Law, Computers & Technology'', 315 \u2013 333.</ref> By contrast, the existing processes are considered largely inefficient and not transparent among businesses because puts businesses in bad light since the onus of the proof rests on them.\n\n== In the Courts ==\n\nMany courts throughout the world are now incorporating ODR into their judicial procedures.  The idea is to add a \"virtual door\" to the multi-door courthouse and promote access to justice.<ref>Schmitz, Amy J., Expanding Access to Remedies Through E-Court Initiatives (April 18, 2019). 67 Buffalo Law Review 89 (2019); University of Missouri School of Law Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2019-07. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3374465</ref>\n\n== In the European Union ==\n\n=== The European Small Claims Procedure ===\n\nSmall claims procedures provide a middle ground between formal litigation and ADR, where disputes involving small value claims can be resolved in courts faster, cheaply, and less formally. The main limitation of small claims procedures is that they are restricted to particular jurisdictions. In order to overcome this limitation the European Commission has produced a regulation for a European Small Claims Procedure (ESCP).<ref>Regulation 861/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure O. J. (L. 199) 1.</ref> Implementation of the ESCP is expected in all EC Member States by January 2009. The ESCP is predominantly a written procedure that deals with claims under \u20ac2,000 arising in cross-border disputes. Its main advantage is that it provides for the enforcement of decisions in any of the member states without the present need to go through the formal mutual recognition of judgements (exequatur).<ref>P. Cort\u00e9s \"Does the Proposed European Procedure Enhance the Resolution of Small Claims?\" (2008)27(1) ''Civil Justice Quarterly'' 94-95.</ref>\n\nGreat expectations are put on the ESCP, which in order to deliver a cost-effective process will have to rely on ICT. This will be a significant challenge, because unlike the UDRP, which is becoming a fully online process for dealing with specific complaints,<ref>See initiative launched by the Czech Arbitration Court for UDRP Complaints. Press Release at <http://www.adr.eu/_inc/en/resource/press_release_pilot.pdf></ref> the ESCP will deal with a variety of civil and commercial disputes. The objective of the ESCP is the creation of a cost efficient procedure applicable to small value claims in cross-border disputes. This objective could only be achieved by using a written procedure, assisted by electronic forms such as emails and videoconferencing as foreseen by the ESCP.<ref name=\"Cortes_2009\"/>{{rp|95}}\n\nThe Regulation allows the use of new technologies in transferring information and evidence between the courts of the different member states. But, it will be the EC Member States who will decide, through their own regulations, which specific means of communication are acceptable in their courts. Given that the ESCP is a regulation and not a directive, it is arguable whether it has left too many aspects to the discretion of member states, which could call into question the legal certainty expected from a European regulation.<ref name=\"Cortes_2009\"/>{{rp|95}} Nevertheless, it can be expected that, in due time, electronic communications will reach every possible and reasonable aspect of the judicial procedure to assist in the resolution of online as well as off-line B2C disputes.\n\nWith the implementation of the ESCP an institutionalized ODR may emerge in Europe in 2009. Many disputes will be resolved by judges communicating with parties through the Internet. It is expected that the ESCP will contribute to mitigate the legitimacy problem which also hampers the emergence of ODR. Perhaps, within the EU, where we have concern for the fairness of private procedures (i.e. restrictions in consumer arbitration) the ESCP may contribute to increase trust in ODR processes.<ref name=\"Cortes_2009\"/>{{rp|97}}\n\n== In India ==\n\nOnline dispute resolution (ODR) in India is in its infancy stage and it is gaining prominence day by day. With the enactment of ''Information Technology Act, 2000'' in India, e-commerce and e-governance have been given a formal and legal recognition in India. Even the traditional arbitration law of India has been reformulated and now India has ''Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996'' in place that is satisfying the harmonised standards of UNCITRAL Model. The amendment made in the''Code of Civil Procedure, 1908'' by introducing section 89 was made to provide methods of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in India.\n\nWith a rapid growth of e-commerce in India, the number of disputes related to online transactions is on the rise. The existing dispute redressal mechanisms are falling short of the business growth and customer expectations. Conventional redressal systems require presence of the parties, and are not in synch with modern online platforms. The Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India has taken note of this and has planned to roll out an Online Consumer Dispute Resolution platform that follows the best practices emerging in the global eCommerce arena. More information of this would be provided at the Online Consumer Mediation Centre, NLSIU (National Law School of India University), Bengaluru, headed by Prof. Dr. Ashok R Patil [http://www.onlinemediationcenter.ac.in web-site]. There is another initiative called ODRways, started by students of NUJS, which is working towards promoting mediation in India, by integrating it with technology. They have developed an online mediation platform for small civil claim disputes.<ref>http://odrways.com/</ref> They are also working towards building an online platform for mediators in India,<ref>http://odrways.com/domain/</ref> which will make it easier for the general public to engage with mediators when they have disputes.\n\nWith the dawn of sophisticated dispute redressal mechanisms, a few legal tech companies in the country are testing the waters for deploying ODR as a means to resolve legal disputes<ref>https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a-startup-that-helps-you-avoid-courts/article24618326.ece</ref>. [https://presolv360.com/ Presolv360] is one such company that specializes in online commercial dispute resolution. It has an interesting approach of charging its customers an annual commitment fee<ref>https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/the-buzz/presolv360-dispute-management-on-the-cloud/story/280068.html</ref> in return for the use of its sophisticated Arbitration360 and Mediation360 modules free of cost. This unique business model together with a bespoke cloud-based platform make Presolv360<ref>https://presolv360.com/</ref> a promising company in the ODR landscape in India.\n\n[https://www.pvtcourt.com/ PrivateCourt] also provide online commercial dispute resolution by providing legally binding arbitration clause in all their agreement.

It primarily involves [[negotiation]], [[mediation]] or [[arbitration]], or a combination of all three. In this respect it is often seen as being the online equivalent of [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR).<ref>Arthur M.

See <www.odr.info>.</ref> It is believed that efficient mechanisms to resolve online disputes will impact in the development of e-commerce. While the application of ODR is not limited to disputes arising out of business to consumer (B2C) online transactions, it seems to be particularly apt for these disputes, since it is logical to use the same medium (the internet) for the resolution of e-commerce disputes when parties are frequently located far from one another.<ref>L.

The assistance of ICT has been named by Katsh and Rifkin as the 'fourth party' because ODR is seen as an independent input to the management of the dispute.<ref name=\"Katsh_Rifkin\"/>{{rp|93\u2013117}} In addition to the two (or more) disputants and the third neutral party, the labelling of technology as the fourth party is a clear metaphor which stresses how technology can be as powerful as to change the traditional three side model. The fourth party embodies a range of capabilities in the same manner that the third party does. While the fourth party may at times take the place of the third party, i.e. automated negotiation, it will frequently be used by the third party as a tool for assisting the process.<ref name=\"Katsh_Wing\">E.

The use of technology usually involves the use of Internet-based communications technology at some stage, but ODR does not necessarily involve purely online processes \u2013 further, many could be replicated offline using pen and paper, or could be achieved using computers without Internet connections.\n\nThe range of terms and [[wiktionary:acronym|acronym]]s used to describe the field augments the confusion often felt by those unfamiliar with the new field of ODR. These terms include:\n\n*Internet Dispute Resolution (iDR)\n*Electronic Dispute Resolution (eDR)\n*Electronic ADR (eADR)\n*Online ADR (oADR)\n\nODR has emerged as the most used term in recent years.\n\nIt is uncertain whether these processes form a new ''discipline'' of ADR or a ''tool'' to aid existing methods of dispute resolution. The most appropriate view would be to view ODR as an [[wiktionary:interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary]] field of dispute resolution.\n\n== Methods ==\n\n=== Consensual ===\n\n====Automated negotiation====\n\nAutomated negotiation relates to those methods in which the technology takes over (aspects of) a negotiation. Most of the ODR services in this area are so-called 'blind-bidding' services. This is a negotiation process designed to determine economic settlements for claims in which liability is not challenged. The blind bidding service may be thought of as a type of auction mechanism where some or all information about the players' bids is hidden. There are two forms of automated negotiation, double blind bidding, which is a method for single monetary issues between two parties, and Visual Blind Bidding, which can be applied to negotiations with any number of parties and issues.\n\n* ''Double Blind Bidding''\n\nDouble blind bidding is a negotiation method for two parties where the offer and demand are kept hidden during the negotiation. It commences when one party invites the other to negotiate the amount of money in dispute. If the other party agrees, they start a blind bidding process whereby both parties make secret offers or bids, which will only be disclosed if both offers match certain standards. They can usually submit up to three offers and if the bids of both parties come within a predetermined range (usually range from 30% to 5%) or a given amount of money (e.g. \u20ac3,000), then the technology automatically settles the dispute in the midpoint of the two offers. Although, it is a simple method, it effectively encourages the parties to reveal their 'bottom line' offers and demands, splitting the difference when the amounts are close.\n\n* ''Visual blind bidding''\n\nThe primary distinction of visual blind bidding is in what is kept hidden from the other parties. In traditional double blind bidding, the offers and demands are kept hidden, whereas with visual blind bidding what is kept hidden is what each party is willing to accept. This method can be effectively applied to the simplest single-value negotiations or the most complex negotiations between any number of parties and issues.<ref>E. Thiessen, \"Description of Visual Blind Bidding\", (Smartsettle, 2019), available at https://smartsettle.com/products/smartsettle-one/smartsettles-visual-blind-bidding/</ref>\n\nVisual blind bidding commences when all parties agree to negotiate with one another. They start the process by exchanging visible optimistic proposals, which define negotiating ranges. The system then generates suggestions that fall within the negotiating ranges. Parties may continue to exchange visible proposals or contribute their own suggestions to the mix. Suggestions contributed by the parties remain anonymous, thus avoiding the face saving problem of accepting a suggestion made by another party.<ref>E. Thiessen et al., \"Rewarding Good Negotiating Behaviour with Smartsettle\", (Smartsettle, 2019), available at https://smartsettle.com/2019/07/12/rewarding-good-negotiating-behavour/</ref>\n\nA resolution is declared by the system at the end of a negotiating session if all parties have accepted one or more packages (of one or more proposed decision values) at the end of that session. Which of those packages becomes the agreement may be determined by an algorithm that rewards the party that moves soonest into the Zone of Agreement. This algorithm is thought to encourage concessions and quickly indicate that they are willing to accept a fair outcome. This is in contrast to the chilling effect that occurs with the more common split-the-difference algorithm.<ref>D. Larson, \"Artificial Intelligence: Robots, Avatars, and the Demise of the Human Mediator\", Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution [Vol. 25:1 2010], available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1461712</ref>\n\nAutomated negotiation has proven to be particularly successful with insurance compensations and commercial activities. It is also a valuable tool for lawyers because they too can use it without revealing what they're willing to accept (unless an agreement is reached) and more importantly, without waiving their right to access the court, in the case that the negotiation is unsuccessful.\n\nThus, ODR is useful for resolving brick and mortar disputes that arise in businesses, insurance companies and municipalities, who are finding that ODR saves them money and time when dealing with B2C disputes.<ref>J. Krause \"Settling it on the Web. New Technology, Lower Costs Enable Growth of Online Dispute Resolution\" ''American Bar Association Journal'', October 2007</ref>\n\n====Assisted negotiation====\n\nIn assisted negotiation the technology assists the negotiation process between the parties. The technology has a similar role as the mediator in a mediation. The role of the technology may be to provide a certain process and/or to provide the parties with specific (evaluative) advice.\n\nMediators use information management skills encouraging parties to reach an amicable agreement by enabling them to communicate more effectively through the rephrasing of their arguments. Conciliation is similar to mediation, but the conciliator can propose solutions for the parties to consider before an agreement is reached. Also, assisted negotiation procedures are designed to improve parties' communications through the assistance of a third party or software. In fact, it has been argued that assisted negotiation, conciliation, and even facilitation, are just different words for mediation.<ref>P. Jacobs \"Mediation Now and Then\" in M. P. Barbee, Newsletter, Mediation, International Bar Association Legal Practice Division, July 2007, p.14.</ref> The major advantages of these processes, when used online, are their informality, simplicity and user friendliness.<ref>Motion P. \"Article 17 ECD: Encouragement of Alternative Dispute Resolution.

However, due to changes in the eBay feedback system in May 2008, SquareTrade decided to stop resolving eBay feedback disputes from June 2008.<ref>SquareTrade \"ODR Is No Longer Offered by SquareTrade\" <http://www.squaretrade.com/pages/odr-discontinued>.</ref> SquareTrade continues providing services to eBay users, such as warranty services and the trustmark program. It appears that in the last year these services have been taken over by eBay and [[PayPal]] dispute resolution services, but results on these services are still scarce.\n\nSquareTrade did not handle disputes between users and eBay, only between sellers and buyers on eBay. SquareTrade offered two levels of dispute resolution: assisted negotiation and mediation. SquareTrade was only used after eBay's own consumer satisfaction process. In the last few years, SquareTrade has resolved millions of disputes across 120 countries in 5 different languages.<ref name=\"Abernethy\">S. Abernethy \"Building Large-Scale Online Dispute Resolution and Trustmark Systems\" Proceedings of the UNECE Forum on ODR 2003, Available at <http://www.odr.info/unece2003>.</ref><ref>See also <http://www.squaretrade.com> (About us) (Last visited, April 2008).</ref>\n\nThe advantage of dealing with large number of disputes is that the same issues arise many times, thus it is possible to divide the disputes into different sections. The SquareTrade process started when a buyer or a seller filed a complaint. To do so, the claimant was asked to fill out a web-based standard claim form that identified the type of dispute and presented a list of common solutions, from which the claimant selected the ones that he agreed to. The other party was contacted by email where he was informed about the SquareTrade process, and asked whether he wished to participate. The parties were often keen on participating because this was the only manner by which the buyer could get redress and the seller positive feedback. The other party filed the response, selecting the resolutions. If both parties agreed on the same resolution, the dispute was resolved. When an agreement could not be reached, parties were put into a negotiation environment. A web interface was used to shape communications into a constructive and polite negotiation. This was achieved with software tools that limited the free text space, encouraged the proposition of agreements, set deadlines and even shaped the tone of exchanges.\n\nThis software was the key element of the process because it took over some of the expertise of the third party. This process could be defined as 'mediated negotiation'. According to Rabinovich-Einy, SquareTrade technology,\n\n\"intervenes in the negotiations between the parties and, by allowing parties to formulate and reformulate the problem and the solution, performs some of what would be associated with a mediator's role, moving the parties from a problem mode to a solution stance.\"<ref>O. Rabinovich-Einy \"Technology's Impact: The Quest for a New Paradigm for Accountability in Mediation\" (2006) 11 ''Harvard Negotiation Law Review'' 258.</ref>\n\nMost disputes (over 80 percent) were resolved during the first two stages, which was an impressive success rate given that in the majority of cases, the parties had already been involved in some type of failed direct negotiation before engaging with SquareTrade.<ref>85 percent of cases are settled through the use of facilitated negotiation. Cf. M. Conley Tyler and Di Bretherton, \"Seventy-Six and Counting: An Analysis of ODR Sites\" Proceedings of the UNECE Forum on ODR 2003.</ref> In the rest of the cases a mediator could be requested for a nominal fee, acting as an expert evaluator or conciliator that made settlement proposals to the parties. This second stage involved the payment of a US$29.95 fee. According to SquareTrade, \"[a] sophisticated case management technology enables mediators to handle lower to medium-value consumer disputes in an efficient cost effective manner.\"<ref name=\"Abernethy\"/>{{rp|2}} The appointed mediator proposed solutions, if required by the parties to do so. Agreements were always kept confidential by SquareTrade, and became binding as contracts.\n\nSquareTrade has proven that processes such as online negotiation and online mediation can be efficient tools to resolve e-commerce disputes. One of the key issues for the success of SquareTrade was the simplicity and convenience of this service. In addition, SquareTrade services to eBay were concentrated on a reduced number of issues, such as delays, bad descriptions and negative feedback. This made possible the development of an efficient automatic process that enhanced online negotiation. The success of consensual and automated processes depends on the nature of the dispute, the accuracy of information provided, and the capability of the software or the third neutral party in assessing and evaluating the facts and evidence. SquareTrade was particularly effective because it introduced incentives that encourage parties' participation; i.e. both parties wished to resolve their dispute: sellers want to obtain positive feedback and buyers want redress. In general terms, widening the scope of clients' claims to the global market invites extra variables to play: cultural differences, such as high and low culture perceptions and the cross-cultural variations of what constitutes the customer satisfaction experience.<ref>Femenia, Nora, Paper presented at the Joint Conference of the OECD, HCOPIL, ICC, The Hague, the Netherlands, December 12, 2000: \"ODR And The Global Management Of Customers' Complaints: How Can ODR Techniques Be Responsive To Different Social And Cultural Environments?\"http://www.mediate.com//articles/femenia.cfm</ref>\n\n====Expedient Non-Adjudicative Online Resolution====\n\nAnother form of alternative dispute resolution prioritizes expedience and dispenses with adjudication all together, in recognition of the litigants' desire to simply dispose of the matter as quickly as possible. By removing any hint of adjudication, services (e.g., One Day Decisions) \"fast track\" a version similar to blind bidding which is restricted privately to the two parties and an algorithm determines a fair value to be accepted by each party. Unlike other services, once accepted by both parties, the settlement amount is applied to the issuance of a Certificate of Final Resolution which both parties accept as irrevocable proof of resolution and final settlement. By avoiding adjudication, expedient non-adjudicative online resolution saves litigants time in court, time away from work and other fees and expenses, while protecting each from ancillary damage: The winning party generally collects more of his disputed amount and the losing party suffers no credit damage from having a judgment entered against him. Expedient Non-Adjudicative Online Resolution is generally utilized in cases that might otherwise be heard in small claims or limited civil matters.\n\n====Crowdjustice====\n\nAs an alternative to private, professional settlement, the concept of crowdjustice has recently taken shape as a means to leverage social norms and the wisdom of crowds<ref>Surowiecki, James (2005). ''[[The Wisdom of Crowds]]''. Anchor Books. pp. xv. {{ISBN|0-385-72170-6}}.</ref> to determine the outcome of a dispute. \n\n=== Adjudicative ===\n\n====Online arbitration====\n\nArbitration is a process where a neutral third party (arbitrator) delivers a decision which is final, and binding on both parties. It can be defined as a quasi-judicial procedure because the award replaces a judicial decision. Arbitrators can be current or former trial judges, but that is not a requirement. However, in an arbitration procedure parties usually can choose the arbitrator and the basis on which the arbitrator makes the decision. Furthermore, it is less formal than litigation, though more than any other consensual process. It is often used to resolve businesses' disputes because this procedure is noted for being private and faster than litigation. Once the procedure is initiated parties cannot abandon it, unless they both agree to discontinuing it (e.g. when they reached a settlement - although usually the settlement will be communicated to the arbitral tribunal and an award rendered on this basis). Another feature of arbitration is that the award is enforceable almost everywhere due to the wide adoption of the 1958 [[New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards]].<ref>The New York Convention has currently more than 150 signatories. See <http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration.html> Cf. J. M. Matthews, \"Consumer Arbitration: Is it Working Now and Will it Work in the Future?\" 79 (2005) ''The Florida Bar Journal'' P. 1.</ref> Moreover, arbitral awards prove frequently easier to enforce than court decisions from overseas.\n\nThe majority of legal studies on online arbitration agree that, neither law, nor arbitral principles, prevent arbitration from taking place online.<ref name=\"Katsh_Rifkin\"/>{{rp|138}}<ref>R. Hill, \"On-line arbitration: issues and solutions\" (1999) 15 ''Arbitration International '' p. 2; M.

Sandfeld Jakobsen, and J. Trzaskowski, eds., ''EU Electronic Commerce Law'' (2004) 180.</ref> However, there may be several aspects in online arbitration that need to be regulated. Although online arbitration seems admissible under the New York Convention and the E-Commerce Directive, this is arguably an assumption by most commentators, rather than a legal statement.<ref>R. Morek \"The Regulatory Framework for Online Dispute Resolution: A Critical View\" (2006) 38 Tol. L. Rev. 165.</ref> Since arbitration is based on a contractual agreement between the parties, an online process without a regulatory framework may generate a significant number of challenges from consumers and other weaker parties if due process cannot be assured. Currently, most arbitration providers allow parties to carry out online only part of the arbitration process, e.g. parties may download claim forms, the submission of documents through standard email or secure web interface, the use of telephone hearings, etc.<ref>L. Ponte and T. Cavenagh, ''Cyberjustice, Online Dispute Resolution for E-Commerce'' (New Jersey, Parson Prentice Hall, 2005) p. 84; European Commission, SANCO, The Study Centre for Consumer Law, Centre for European Economic Law Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, \"An Analysis and Evaluation of Alternative Means of Consumer Redress other than Redress through Ordinary Judicial Proceedings\" The United States National Report, Leuven, January 2007. p. 7 Currently the AAA provides Webfile and Neutrals' eCentre web-based platform to parties and neutrals for the management of the procedures. Cf. <www.adr.org>; See B. Davis \"Symposium Enhancing Worldwide Understanding Through Online Dispute Resolution: Walking Along in the Mission\" 38 (2006) U. Tol. L. Rev. 2.</ref> Other providers conduct their proceedings exclusively online, either by email or on a dedicated web platform.<ref>\"How it works - Anywhere Arbitration\"<http://www.anywherearbitration.com/how-it-works.html></ref> A key element of arbitration is the right for a party to question the witnesses of the other parties and that can now be done at low cost with an online audio and video hearing process using newer technologies such as Skype Premium or [[Google Hangouts]]. Cross examination of remote witnesses regulated by the arbitrator can ensure the fairness and maintain a judicial quality for the online arbitration process.<ref>[http://online-arbitration.com online-arbitration.com]</ref>\n\nThe main challenge for online arbitration is that if judicial enforcement is required then it partly defeats the purpose of having an online process. Alternatively, some processes have developed self-enforcement mechanisms such as technical enforcements, black lists and trustmarks.\n\n====The Uniform Domain Names Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP)====\n\nTraditionally arbitration resolves disputes by delivering a decision that will be legally binding, i.e. enforceable by the courts in the same manner as a judgment. Non binding arbitration processes may also be effective when using ODR tools because they often encourage settlements by imparting a dose of reality and objectivity.<ref>t. Stipanowich, \"The Arbitration Penumbra: Arbitration Law and the Rapidly Changing Landscape of Dispute Resolution\" ''Legal Studies Working Paper Series'', Paper Number 2008/1, 30 Nevada Law Journal, Forthcoming. Available at <http://ssrn.com/abstract=1007490>.</ref> In addition, self-enforcement measures may reinforce the efficacy of non binding processes. The most significant example is the [[Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP) created by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). Some commentators have referred to the UDRP as an administrative process. In any case, the UDRP has developed a transparent global ODR process that allows trade mark owners to fight efficiently cybersquatting. The UDRP is used to resolve disputes between trade mark owners and those who have registered a domain name in bad faith for the purpose of reselling it for a profit, or taking advantage of the reputation of a trademark.\n\nTrademark owners accessing the UDRP must prove to the panel three circumstances: \n#similarity of the domain name to the trade or service mark;\n#lack of rights or legitimate interest in the registered domain name;\n#bad faith in the registration and use of the domain name.\n\nHowever, the UDRP presents its own problems that show the challenges that an online adversarial system applied to mainstream e-commerce disputes would have. The main worry is that the evaluation of the panel decisions often shows a lack of unanimous consensus in the interpretation of the UDRP.<ref>WIPO, Overview of WIPO Panel Views on Selected UDRP Questions. This case study is based on the evaluation of 7,000 WIPO panel decisions published in February 2005. Available at <http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/>.</ref> This may be due to a number of reasons, such as the lack of an appellative review and panels composed by members from a multitude of jurisdictions and informed by different legal traditions.\n\nOn the other side, it is undeniable what ICANN with the UDRP has achieved in developing an effective ODR procedure based on contractual adherence that allows trade mark owners to transfer or cancel a domain that blatantly violates IP rights. The UDRP providers have dealt efficiently with over 30,000 domain name disputes. Their success derives from two aspects: First, the UDRP deals only with blatant disputes, which are abusive registrations made in bad faith in order to take advantage of the reputation of existing trademarks. Secondly, it has incorporated a self-enforcement mechanism, which transfers and cancels domain names without the need for judicial involvement. This is a positive accomplishment for the development of e-commerce because it favours consumers' confidence in the Internet by reducing the number of fraudulent registered domain names.\n\n====Chargebacks====\n\nOne of the main focuses of e-commerce up until recently has been related to secure payments. [[Chargebacks]] is a remedy used to reverse transactions made with credit or debit cards when a fraudulent use has occurred, or when there is a violation of the contract terms. This method is very popular among online consumers since this is the main mechanism to transfer money online. In addition, consumers are not required to give evidence to cancel a payment. The vendor has the burden of proving that the merchandise or service was given according to the contract terms. Once this is proved the bank makes effective the payment to the vendor.\n\nChargebacks are largely used around the world by banks and the main credit card suppliers i.e. Visa, MasterCard and American Express. Yet, the coverage of debit and credit cards varies considerably amongst different countries.<ref>S. Andrews, OECD Workshop on Consumer Dispute Resolution and Redress in the Global Marketplace, Background Project, 19 April 2005, p.9 and OECD report on Consumer Dispute Resolution and Redress in the Global Marketplace, published 11 April 2006. p.12-16 Available at <http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/26/61/36456184.pdf>.</ref> Commonly, debit cardholders have fewer protections than credit card holders, but it also varies depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nIt is then not surprising why credit cards are the major source of payments for consumers in e-commerce. They provide a remedy that reverses all transactions when a fraudulent use has occurred, or when there is a violation of the contract terms. However this method has limitations; it offers one single remedy (the return of the payment), and not all disputes imply a breach of contract or fraud.\n\nSimilarly, online payment providers, like PayPal.com, retain temporarily the money paid by a buyer when the latter makes a complaint within 45 days after the payment was made. PayPal.com holds the money until the dispute is settled, but only in those cases where the merchandise did not arrive, or the description of the product was significantly different from the product itself.<ref>See Seller Protection Policies in <www.paypal.com>.</ref> In these circumstances PayPal.com acts akin to an online arbitrator.<ref>I. Col\u00f3n-Fung, \"Protecting the New Face of Entrepreneurship: Online Appropriate Dispute Resolution and International Consumer-to-Consumer Online Transactions\" 12 (2007) ''Fordham Journal of Corporate and Financial Law'' p. 256.</ref> However, in those circumstances where the seller takes away the money from his account before the buyer makes the claim, PayPal.com will not be responsible for the buyer's loss. Despite this, PayPal is in a very strong position since in most cases it is able to freeze the amount of money and resolve the dispute providing an instant and effective enforcement.\n\nOverall, chargebacks intends to balance the inequality of power between consumers and businesses. It is regarded as a very efficient tool for consumers because the speed, accessibility and lack of charge for their clients, who would just have to notify their banks or card issuers to cancel a transaction. Thus, Edwards and Wilson suggested that it would be advisable to focus on developing chargebacks and other soft ODR methods because they are very effective amongst mainstream consumers.<ref>L. Edwards, & C. Wilson, 'Redress and Alternative Dispute Resolution in EU Cross-Border E-Commerce Transactions ', (2007) 21(3) ''International Review of Law, Computers & Technology'', 315 \u2013 333.</ref> By contrast, the existing processes are considered largely inefficient and not transparent among businesses because puts businesses in bad light since the onus of the proof rests on them.\n\n== In the Courts ==\n\nMany courts throughout the world are now incorporating ODR into their judicial procedures.  The idea is to add a \"virtual door\" to the multi-door courthouse and promote access to justice.<ref>Schmitz, Amy J., Expanding Access to Remedies Through E-Court Initiatives (April 18, 2019). 67 Buffalo Law Review 89 (2019); University of Missouri School of Law Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2019-07. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3374465</ref>\n\n== In the European Union ==\n\n=== The European Small Claims Procedure ===\n\nSmall claims procedures provide a middle ground between formal litigation and ADR, where disputes involving small value claims can be resolved in courts faster, cheaply, and less formally. The main limitation of small claims procedures is that they are restricted to particular jurisdictions. In order to overcome this limitation the European Commission has produced a regulation for a European Small Claims Procedure (ESCP).<ref>Regulation 861/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure O. J. (L. 199) 1.</ref> Implementation of the ESCP is expected in all EC Member States by January 2009. The ESCP is predominantly a written procedure that deals with claims under \u20ac2,000 arising in cross-border disputes. Its main advantage is that it provides for the enforcement of decisions in any of the member states without the present need to go through the formal mutual recognition of judgements (exequatur).<ref>P. Cort\u00e9s \"Does the Proposed European Procedure Enhance the Resolution of Small Claims?\" (2008)27(1) ''Civil Justice Quarterly'' 94-95.</ref>\n\nGreat expectations are put on the ESCP, which in order to deliver a cost-effective process will have to rely on ICT. This will be a significant challenge, because unlike the UDRP, which is becoming a fully online process for dealing with specific complaints,<ref>See initiative launched by the Czech Arbitration Court for UDRP Complaints. Press Release at <http://www.adr.eu/_inc/en/resource/press_release_pilot.pdf></ref> the ESCP will deal with a variety of civil and commercial disputes. The objective of the ESCP is the creation of a cost efficient procedure applicable to small value claims in cross-border disputes. This objective could only be achieved by using a written procedure, assisted by electronic forms such as emails and videoconferencing as foreseen by the ESCP.<ref name=\"Cortes_2009\"/>{{rp|95}}\n\nThe Regulation allows the use of new technologies in transferring information and evidence between the courts of the different member states. But, it will be the EC Member States who will decide, through their own regulations, which specific means of communication are acceptable in their courts. Given that the ESCP is a regulation and not a directive, it is arguable whether it has left too many aspects to the discretion of member states, which could call into question the legal certainty expected from a European regulation.<ref name=\"Cortes_2009\"/>{{rp|95}} Nevertheless, it can be expected that, in due time, electronic communications will reach every possible and reasonable aspect of the judicial procedure to assist in the resolution of online as well as off-line B2C disputes.\n\nWith the implementation of the ESCP an institutionalized ODR may emerge in Europe in 2009. Many disputes will be resolved by judges communicating with parties through the Internet. It is expected that the ESCP will contribute to mitigate the legitimacy problem which also hampers the emergence of ODR. Perhaps, within the EU, where we have concern for the fairness of private procedures (i.e. restrictions in consumer arbitration) the ESCP may contribute to increase trust in ODR processes.<ref name=\"Cortes_2009\"/>{{rp|97}}\n\n== In India ==\n\nOnline dispute resolution (ODR) in India is in its infancy stage and it is gaining prominence day by day. With the enactment of ''Information Technology Act, 2000'' in India, e-commerce and e-governance have been given a formal and legal recognition in India. Even the traditional arbitration law of India has been reformulated and now India has ''Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996'' in place that is satisfying the harmonised standards of UNCITRAL Model. The amendment made in the''Code of Civil Procedure, 1908'' by introducing section 89 was made to provide methods of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in India.\n\nWith a rapid growth of e-commerce in India, the number of disputes related to online transactions is on the rise. The existing dispute redressal mechanisms are falling short of the business growth and customer expectations. Conventional redressal systems require presence of the parties, and are not in synch with modern online platforms. The Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India has taken note of this and has planned to roll out an Online Consumer Dispute Resolution platform that follows the best practices emerging in the global eCommerce arena. More information of this would be provided at the Online Consumer Mediation Centre, NLSIU (National Law School of India University), Bengaluru, headed by Prof. Dr. Ashok R Patil [http://www.onlinemediationcenter.ac.in web-site]. There is another initiative called ODRways, started by students of NUJS, which is working towards promoting mediation in India, by integrating it with technology. They have developed an online mediation platform for small civil claim disputes.<ref>http://odrways.com/</ref> They are also working towards building an online platform for mediators in India,<ref>http://odrways.com/domain/</ref> which will make it easier for the general public to engage with mediators when they have disputes.\n\nWith the dawn of sophisticated dispute redressal mechanisms, a few legal tech companies in the country are testing the waters for deploying ODR as a means to resolve legal disputes<ref>https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a-startup-that-helps-you-avoid-courts/article24618326.ece</ref>. [https://presolv360.com/ Presolv360] is one such company that specializes in online commercial dispute resolution. It has an interesting approach of charging its customers an annual commitment fee<ref>https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/the-buzz/presolv360-dispute-management-on-the-cloud/story/280068.html</ref> in return for the use of its sophisticated Arbitration360 and Mediation360 modules free of cost.

It was co-directed by [[Naoyoshi Shiotani]] and [[Katsuyuki Motohiro]] and written by [[Gen Urobuchi]], with character designs by [[Akira Amano]] and featuring music by [[Yugo Kanno]]. The series aired on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[Noitamina]] programming block between October 2012 and March 2013. A second season aired between October and December 2014, with a feature film titled, ''[[Psycho-Pass: The Movie]]'' released in January 2015. In 2019,  ''[[Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System]]'' premiered the first of its three independent films, spanning release dates between January and March. All of the stories take place in an authoritarian future [[dystopia]] where omnipresent public sensors continuously scan the mental states of every passing citizen. A third season aired between October and December 2019, with a sequel film, ''[[Psycho-Pass 3: First Inspector]]'', released in March 2020.\n\n''Psycho-Pass'' originated from Production I.G.'s interest in making a successor to [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s achievements. The series was inspired by several live-action films. Chief director Katsuyuki Motohiro aimed to explore psychological themes in society's youth using dystopian storylines. Multiple books and movies influenced ''Psycho-Pass'' with the most notable being the 1982 American [[science fiction film]] ''[[Blade Runner]]''. The series was licensed by [[Funimation]] in North America.  Two [[manga]] adaptations have been serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Jump Square]]'' magazine. Several novels, including an adaptation and prequels to the original story, have been published. An episodic video game adaptation called ''Chimi Chara Psycho-Pass'' was developed by [[Nitroplus]] staffers in collaboration with Production I.G. New novels and another manga were serialized in 2014. A prequel manga centered around Kogami's past has been written.\n\nThe first season of the anime garnered critical acclaim in both Japan and the west with critics praising the characters' roles and interactions set within the dystopian environment. The animation has also been praised despite issues in latter episodes which required fixing in the DVD volumes of the series. On the other hand, the second series, ''Psycho-Pass 2'', received mixed critical response stemming from its heavy use of gore as well as the characterization of the new villain. \n\n==Plot==\n\n===Setting===\n''Psycho-Pass'' is set in a futuristic era in Japan where the {{nihongo|Sibyl System|\u30b7\u30d3\u30e5\u30e9\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0|Shibyura Shisutemu}}, a powerful network of psychometric scanners, actively measures the biometrics of its citizens' minds and mentalities using a \"cymatic scan\" of the brain. The resulting assessment is called a {{nihongo|Psycho-Pass|\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30d1\u30b9|Saikopasu}}. When the calculated likelihood of an individual committing a crime, measured by the {{nihongo|Crime Coefficient|\u72af\u7f6a\u4fc2\u6570|Hanzaikeis\u016b}} index, exceeds an accepted threshold (100), they are pursued, apprehended, and either arrested or decomposed by the field officers of the Crime Investigation Department of the Public Safety Bureau. Elite officers known as Inspectors research and evaluate crime scenes and potential criminals with the assistance of Enforcers, who are themselves latent criminals. Both are equipped with personally activated, hand-held weapons called \"Dominators\" that only fire when aimed at suspects with higher-than-acceptable Crime Coefficients and then, only with the Sibyl System's choice of action. Inspectors and Enforcers work as a team, though Inspectors have jurisdiction to fire their Dominators on the Enforcers should they pose a danger to the public.\n\n===Story===\n{{main|List of Psycho-Pass characters}}\n\n''Psycho-Pass'' is seen through the eyes of [[Akane Tsunemori]], a rookie Inspector within Unit One (aka Division One) of the Ministry of Welfare Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Department. [[Shinya Kogami]] is an Enforcer under her watch during her first mission. When she judges him a threat to an apprehended criminal's life, she uses her Dominator to prevent him from decomposing the criminal. Initially ashamed of her action, Kogami thanks her for preventing what could be perceived as murder, an opinion which influences Tsunemori to stay on the force. The unit uncovers the crimes of [[Shogo Makishima]], a prolific criminal mastermind. Makishima is {{nihongo|Criminally Asymptomatic|\u514d\u7f6a\u4f53\u8cea|Menzai Taishitsu}} \u2013 a person persistently assessed by the Sibyl System as having a low crime coefficient despite all actions and attitudes, thus protecting him from Dominator harm. Tsunemori is accompanied by veteran Inspector [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Nobuchika Ginoza|Nobuchika Ginoza]], a strict man who looks down on Enforcers; [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Tomomi Masaoka|Tomomi Masaoka]], a middle-aged Enforcer who used to be a detective; [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Shusei Kagari|Shusei Kagari]], a carefree young man who was marked as a latent criminal in childhood; and [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Yayoi Kunizuka|Yayoi Kunizuka]], a former musician turned into a latent criminal stemming from a relationship with a terrorist.\n\nThe unit starts hunting Makishima, but it is Kogami who is most invested, having lost a friend at the hands of the villain. Meanwhile, Makishima is invited by [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Joshu Kasei|Joshu Kasei]], the android form of Sibyl, to join their ranks. He refuses and flees. Realizing this, Kogami leaves Unit One to find and kill him. The Sibyl System orders Tsunemori to capture Makishima and execute Kogami, but she agrees only on the condition that they withdraw the execution order for Kogami. Unit One now searches for both men. Upon finding him, Makishima nearly kills Ginoza, but Masaoka sacrifices his life to save him and despite Tsunemori's efforts, Kogami kills Makishima then escapes from PSB confinement, whereabouts unknown.\n\nIn ''Psycho-Pass 2'', Tsunemori leads a restored Unit One that includes rookie inspector [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Mika Shimotsuki|Mika Shimotsuki]]; Ginoza, who has been demoted to Enforcer; Kunizuka and two new Enforcers named [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Sakuya Togane|Sakuya Togane]] and [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Sho Hinakawa|Sho Hinakawa]]. The team faces a new threat in the form of [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Kirito Kamui|Kirito Kamui]], another criminal mastermind who, like Makishima, intends to bring down the Sibyl System but, unlike Makishima, wants to do so by exploiting its flaws instead of  wreaking havoc. Skilled in avoiding all forms of detection and capable of helping his supporters keep their Crime Coefficients low, few believe that he actually exists. Tsunemori resists in ''Psycho-Pass: The Movie'' where she searches for Kogami, now a freedom figther in another country. The fate of Kogami among other characters is explored in the ''Sinners of the System'' film.\n\nIn ''Psycho-Pass 3'' Tsunemori and her team help the people of Shambala Float uncover government corruption with the unlikely assistance of Kogami, whom Tsunemori locates while he is a member of a guerilla group he believes is working to bring freedom to the people of that country. The mission results in the disbandment of Unit One and Kogami's disappearance, yet again. An unrevealed situation leads to Tsunemori's arrest for putting the public in danger. The unfolding story and the truth Tsunemori seeks involves two new Inspectors: [[Arata Shindo]] and [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Kei Mikhail Ignatov|Kei Mikhail \nIgnatov]]. Their first case with the Public Safety Bureau involves investigating the crash landing of a passenger drone airplane that results in the death of a passenger and the discovery of a large group of immigrants. During the investigation and those that follow, Shindo and Ignatov uncover evidence of a conspiracy headed by a shadowy organization called Bifrost that uses the mechanism of a tournament game called Roundrobin in order to manipulate societal events. As evidence and knowledge about Bifrost increases, the focus of the story narrows until Shindo and Ignatov find themselves at odds with one another. This leads to a choice by Ignatov; one to be further explored in the 2020 sequel film ''First Inspector''.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Shiotani Naoyoshi from \"PSYCHO-PASS Sinners of the System Case.1 & Case.2\" at Opening Ceremony of the Tokyo International Film Festival 2018 (43801020490).jpg|left|thumb|Director Naoyoshi Shiotani.]]\nThe series was directed by [[Naoyoshi Shiotani]], written by Gen Urobuchi and features character designs by ''[[Reborn!]]'' manga artist [[Akira Amano]].

Urobuchi and  Motohiro said the film would have to contain a scenario independent of Japan's Sibyl System society. Shiotani wanted to create the film in collaboration with the staff who had worked on the first season and with character designer Naoyuki Onda and art director Shuichi Kusamori, who also worked on the series.

To make the story more realistic, Shiotani decided to have the foreigners speak English, in contrast with other films in which they typically speak Japanese. Both lead actors, [[Tomokazu Seki]] (Kogami) and [[Kana Hanazawa]] (Akane), were surprised at this proposal because they had multiple English lines. Shiotani wished to explore what happens when a confined society expands into other countries, bringing chaos rather than peace, which would make the audience further question this ideal.<ref name=\"proflie\">{{cite book|title=Psycho-Pass Official Profiling 2|isbn=978-4041027691|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|year=2015}}</ref><ref name=\"myuzz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mymbuzz.com/2016/10/30/psycho-pass-director-naoyoshi-shiotani-interview-mcm-london/|title=Psycho-Pass Director Naoyoshi Shiotani Interview @ MCM London|date=October 30, 2016|author=Simons, Roxy|publisher=MyM Buzz|accessdate=November 11, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418033338/http://www.mymbuzz.com/2016/10/30/psycho-pass-director-naoyoshi-shiotani-interview-mcm-london/|archivedate=April 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Shiotani chose Southeast Asia, thinking a country working hard to further its development would be fitting for the story.<ref name=\"proflie\"/>\n\nThe films ''Sinners of the System'' were first announced in Japan by [[Fuji TV]] in March 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-03-08/psycho-pass-ss-3-part-anime-film-project-revealed/.128710|title=Psycho-Pass SS 3-Part Anime Film Project Revealed (Updated)|work=Anime News Network|accessdate=November 12, 2018|date=March 8, 2018}}</ref> Shiotani returned as the films' director.

Nevertheless, he noted that this duo possessed a different dynamic due to Ginoza having undergone a notable character arc across the previous projects mainly due to his relationship with Masaoka and Kogami. Voice actress [[Ayane Sakura]] believed Shimotsuki was now more fitting for the role of a heroine thanks to her experience in the second television series where she was the youngest main character. Once the first movie premiered, Shiotani commented the trilogy would \"broaden your perspective [the audience's]. They're those kinds of movies\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://manga.tokyo/report/psycho-pass-sinners-of-the-system-case-1-opening-day-report/|title=Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System Case.1 Opening Day Report|publisher=Manga.Tokyo|accessdate=August 17, 2019|date=2019-02-19}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2019 anime series, Shiotani entrusted the writer Ubukata, Fukami and Yoshigami with handling a new cast. Fukami and Yoshikami wrote the script while Ubukata was in charge of the composition. Fukami was surprised with the ongoing dynamic between Shiotani and Ubukata as, despite the new story and character additions not included in the original series composition, the series still felt like ''Psycho-Pass''. He clarified that every episode of the new series handle a different theme based on Ubukata's writing, and the writers found writing the second half of the series challenging. In creating the new leads, [[Arata Shindo]] and [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Kei Mikhail Ignatov|Kei Mihail Ignatov]] were handled as \"two good buddies\" while showcasing striking differences between them. Ubukata then conceived the idea of \"psychology vs. combat\" making Shindo a trained mentalist while Ignatov is former military with martial arts skills. Special attention was given to Shindo's characterization as he could come across as an unlikable character based on how he leads conversations but was still caring. Ubukata wanted the two main characters to be written solely by Fukami.<ref name=\"third\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.jlist.com/featured/psycho-pass-3-writers-commentary-translated/|publisher=Jlist|accessdate=December 23, 2019|title=Psycho-Pass 3 Writer\u2019s Commentary Translated <!-- https://moca-news.net/article/20191109/2019110900300a_/01/ -->|date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\n===Design===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Sketches of Shinya Kogami (left) by Akira Amano (right).

Akane's progression from an innocent newcomer to a mature and haunted person was one of the staff's main objectives.<ref name=\"jentonline\"/>\n\nMotohiro allowed his team to use very graphic elements, even though they could reduce female viewership. He acknowledged that the series may be too violent for a younger demographic and said that he would not want his son to watch it because of its psychological brutality.<ref name=\"interviewmothiro\"/> He added that the team did not want to make a violent series but an \"artistic series that just happened to have some violence included in it\".<ref name=\"jentonline\"/> About the amount of violence, Shiotani told Urobuchi, \"just let us deal with it.\"<ref name=\"jentonline\"/> Some of these violent scenes occur off-camera but whenever a protagonist was involved, the moment was developed to be memorable. The team twice had to remake scenes because the television station complained that they went \"overboard.\"<ref name=\"jentonline\"/>\n\nMotohiro wanted the series to counter concurrent anime trends. The use of ''[[Moe (slang)|moe]]'' (slang) was banned at staff meetings because they appreciated dramas like ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' and ''Patlabor'' that focused on conflicts between male characters. As the series was \"anti-moe,\" the team decided to avoid having Tsunemori remove her clothes and instead had Kogami do it. Nevertheless, the show attracted a female viewership because the conflict between the male characters appeared to attract the ''[[shonen ai]]'' genre fans.<ref name=\"panel\"/> Although Shiotani also wanted the series to avoid romance between male characters, he believed the fight scenes between male characters unintentionally attracted female fans.<ref name=\"panel\"/> The staff decided to focus on friendships rather than romantic relationships.<ref name=\"jentonline\"/>\n\n===Influences===\nThe series was inspired by several Western films, most notably ''[[L.A.

[[Egoist (band)|Egoist]], who composed the ending theme, had debuted on Noitamina with ''[[Guilty Crown]]''. Shiotani said they asked Egoist to record three versions of the ending theme so they could alternate them to match the episode's ending.<ref name=\"secondseasonmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://otakuusamagazine.com/Anime/News1/Noitamina-Interviews-PsychoPass-Director-5650.aspx |title=Noitamina Interviews Psycho-Pass Director |publisher=Otaku USA |date=May 8, 2014 |accessdate=May 9, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512221930/http://otakuusamagazine.com/Anime/News1/Noitamina-Interviews-PsychoPass-Director-5650.aspx |archivedate=May 12, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Across the series, time limits resulted in the ending songs being removed or replaced with instrumental versions to avoid cutting scenes from the episode.

Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. This raises the question of whether it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. An example of this occurs in the first episode when a woman is kidnapped and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's rules, the police can decompose her, but Tsunemori delays action, choosing to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. This challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime correlates with actually committing a crime. According to Anime News Network, \"We are all capable of doing bad things at times{{mdash}}should we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really all comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal\".<ref name=\"psychostream\">{{cite news|work=Anime News Network|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass/episodes-1|title=Review: Psycho-Pass Episodes 1 - 11 Streaming|accessdate=April 3, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328220114/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass/episodes-1|archivedate=March 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Psycho-Pass'' further questions the notion of overriding the individual's needs in favor of general social value by asking the audience to consider if it is morally and socially acceptable to kill individuals who may potentially commit crimes so long as we accept that the harm caused to society outweighs the harm caused to an individual who is falsely charged. In other words, the Sibyl System operates on the principles of opportunity cost and acceptable risk. Relying on the Sibyl System paradoxically creates a society which fears no crime as a whole, but individuals who personally fear the consequences of the Sibyl System's verdicts. Urobuchi himself has said that one of the series' central thematic ideas is \"fear.\" Shogo Makishima's actions stem from feeling out of place because the Sibyl System cannot accept him as he is, labeling him a deviant within the structure of society itself.<ref>{{cite news|work=Anime News Network|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2014-09-17/gen-urobuchi/.78542|title=Interview: Gen Urobuchi|date=September 17, 2014|accessdate=September 17, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917164359/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2014-09-17/gen-urobuchi/.78542|archivedate=September 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nEmotional repression is another theme explored in ''Psycho-Pass''. The identification of latent criminals is partially based on the emotions judged by society to be negative, such as sadness or anger, being scanned by the Sibyl System. Kotaku states, \"because of these scans, Psycho-Pass shows an interesting future where 'mental beauty' is as sought after as physical beauty. It is also a future where the police's job is little more than to watch the latent criminals they control\u2014because if they did any real detective work, they might start to think like the criminals they are trying to catch and thus become latent criminals themselves.\"<ref name=\"kotaku\"/> Many of the main characters feel nostalgia throughout the series. The many references to older literature, philosophy, music and theater create a \"nostalgic world building for a time before psycho-passes\".<ref name=\"psychostream\"/>\n\n==Media==\n===Anime===\n{{see also|List of Psycho-Pass episodes|List of Psycho-Pass 2 episodes|List of Psycho-Pass 3 episodes}}\n\nThe anime series produced by Production I.G. was broadcast in Japan on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[Noitamina]] programming block between October 12, 2012 and March 22, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/01.html#onair_schedule|script-title=ja:\u7b2c1\u8a71\u300c\u72af\u7f6a\u4fc2\u6570\u300d|publisher=Production I.G|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 7, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323164730/http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/01.html#onair_schedule|archivedate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"final\">{{cite web|url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/22.html#onair_schedule|script-title=ja:\u7b2c22\u8a71\u300c\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u4e16\u754c\u300d|publisher=Production I.G|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 7, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323172746/http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/22.html#onair_schedule|archivedate=March 23, 2014}}</ref> [[Toho]] started releasing the series on DVD and Blu-ray formats on December 21, 2012.

It was co-directed by [[Naoyoshi Shiotani]] and [[Katsuyuki Motohiro]] and written by [[Gen Urobuchi]], with character designs by [[Akira Amano]] and featuring music by [[Yugo Kanno]]. The series aired on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[Noitamina]] programming block between October 2012 and March 2013. A second season aired between October and December 2014, with a feature film titled, ''[[Psycho-Pass: The Movie]]'' released in January 2015. In 2019,  ''[[Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System]]'' premiered the first of its three independent films, spanning release dates between January and March. All of the stories take place in an authoritarian future [[dystopia]] where omnipresent public sensors continuously scan the mental states of every passing citizen. A third season aired between October and December 2019, with a sequel film, ''[[Psycho-Pass 3: First Inspector]]'', released in March 2020.\n\n''Psycho-Pass'' originated from Production I.G.'s interest in making a successor to [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s achievements. The series was inspired by several live-action films. Chief director Katsuyuki Motohiro aimed to explore psychological themes in society's youth using dystopian storylines. Multiple books and movies influenced ''Psycho-Pass'' with the most notable being the 1982 American [[science fiction film]] ''[[Blade Runner]]''. The series was licensed by [[Funimation]] in North America.  Two [[manga]] adaptations have been serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Jump Square]]'' magazine. Several novels, including an adaptation and prequels to the original story, have been published. An episodic video game adaptation called ''Chimi Chara Psycho-Pass'' was developed by [[Nitroplus]] staffers in collaboration with Production I.G. New novels and another manga were serialized in 2014. A prequel manga centered around Kogami's past has been written.\n\nThe first season of the anime garnered critical acclaim in both Japan and the west with critics praising the characters' roles and interactions set within the dystopian environment. The animation has also been praised despite issues in latter episodes which required fixing in the DVD volumes of the series. On the other hand, the second series, ''Psycho-Pass 2'', received mixed critical response stemming from its heavy use of gore as well as the characterization of the new villain. \n\n==Plot==\n\n===Setting===\n''Psycho-Pass'' is set in a futuristic era in Japan where the {{nihongo|Sibyl System|\u30b7\u30d3\u30e5\u30e9\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0|Shibyura Shisutemu}}, a powerful network of psychometric scanners, actively measures the biometrics of its citizens' minds and mentalities using a \"cymatic scan\" of the brain. The resulting assessment is called a {{nihongo|Psycho-Pass|\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30d1\u30b9|Saikopasu}}. When the calculated likelihood of an individual committing a crime, measured by the {{nihongo|Crime Coefficient|\u72af\u7f6a\u4fc2\u6570|Hanzaikeis\u016b}} index, exceeds an accepted threshold (100), they are pursued, apprehended, and either arrested or decomposed by the field officers of the Crime Investigation Department of the Public Safety Bureau. Elite officers known as Inspectors research and evaluate crime scenes and potential criminals with the assistance of Enforcers, who are themselves latent criminals. Both are equipped with personally activated, hand-held weapons called \"Dominators\" that only fire when aimed at suspects with higher-than-acceptable Crime Coefficients and then, only with the Sibyl System's choice of action. Inspectors and Enforcers work as a team, though Inspectors have jurisdiction to fire their Dominators on the Enforcers should they pose a danger to the public.\n\n===Story===\n{{main|List of Psycho-Pass characters}}\n\n''Psycho-Pass'' is seen through the eyes of [[Akane Tsunemori]], a rookie Inspector within Unit One (aka Division One) of the Ministry of Welfare Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Department. [[Shinya Kogami]] is an Enforcer under her watch during her first mission. When she judges him a threat to an apprehended criminal's life, she uses her Dominator to prevent him from decomposing the criminal. Initially ashamed of her action, Kogami thanks her for preventing what could be perceived as murder, an opinion which influences Tsunemori to stay on the force. The unit uncovers the crimes of [[Shogo Makishima]], a prolific criminal mastermind. Makishima is {{nihongo|Criminally Asymptomatic|\u514d\u7f6a\u4f53\u8cea|Menzai Taishitsu}} \u2013 a person persistently assessed by the Sibyl System as having a low crime coefficient despite all actions and attitudes, thus protecting him from Dominator harm. Tsunemori is accompanied by veteran Inspector [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Nobuchika Ginoza|Nobuchika Ginoza]], a strict man who looks down on Enforcers; [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Tomomi Masaoka|Tomomi Masaoka]], a middle-aged Enforcer who used to be a detective; [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Shusei Kagari|Shusei Kagari]], a carefree young man who was marked as a latent criminal in childhood; and [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Yayoi Kunizuka|Yayoi Kunizuka]], a former musician turned into a latent criminal stemming from a relationship with a terrorist.\n\nThe unit starts hunting Makishima, but it is Kogami who is most invested, having lost a friend at the hands of the villain. Meanwhile, Makishima is invited by [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Joshu Kasei|Joshu Kasei]], the android form of Sibyl, to join their ranks. He refuses and flees. Realizing this, Kogami leaves Unit One to find and kill him. The Sibyl System orders Tsunemori to capture Makishima and execute Kogami, but she agrees only on the condition that they withdraw the execution order for Kogami. Unit One now searches for both men. Upon finding him, Makishima nearly kills Ginoza, but Masaoka sacrifices his life to save him and despite Tsunemori's efforts, Kogami kills Makishima then escapes from PSB confinement, whereabouts unknown.\n\nIn ''Psycho-Pass 2'', Tsunemori leads a restored Unit One that includes rookie inspector [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Mika Shimotsuki|Mika Shimotsuki]]; Ginoza, who has been demoted to Enforcer; Kunizuka and two new Enforcers named [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Sakuya Togane|Sakuya Togane]] and [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Sho Hinakawa|Sho Hinakawa]]. The team faces a new threat in the form of [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Kirito Kamui|Kirito Kamui]], another criminal mastermind who, like Makishima, intends to bring down the Sibyl System but, unlike Makishima, wants to do so by exploiting its flaws instead of  wreaking havoc. Skilled in avoiding all forms of detection and capable of helping his supporters keep their Crime Coefficients low, few believe that he actually exists, including Tsunemori.\n\n''Psycho-Pass 3'' occurs after the events of ''[[Psycho-Pass: The Movie]]'', wherein Tsunemori and her team help the people of Shambala Float uncover government corruption with the unlikely assistance of Kogami, whom Tsunemori locates while he is a member of a guerilla group he believes is working to bring freedom to the people of that country. The mission results in the disbandment of Unit One and Kogami's disappearance, yet again.\n\nAn unrevealed situation leads to Tsunemori's arrest for putting the public in danger. The unfolding story and the truth Tsunemori seeks involves two new Inspectors: [[Arata Shindo]] and [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Kei Mikhail Ignatov|Kei Mikhail \nIgnatov]]. Their first case with the Public Safety Bureau involves investigating the crash landing of a passenger drone airplane that results in the death of a passenger and the discovery of a large group of immigrants. During the investigation and those that follow, Shindo and Ignatov uncover evidence of a conspiracy headed by a shadowy organization called Bifrost that uses the mechanism of a tournament game called Roundrobin in order to manipulate societal events. As evidence and knowledge about Bifrost increases, the focus of the story narrows until Shindo and Ignatov find themselves at odds with one another. This leads to a choice by Ignatov; one to be further explored in the 2020 sequel film.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Shiotani Naoyoshi from \"PSYCHO-PASS Sinners of the System Case.1 & Case.2\" at Opening Ceremony of the Tokyo International Film Festival 2018 (43801020490).jpg|left|thumb|Director Naoyoshi Shiotani.]]\nThe series was directed by [[Naoyoshi Shiotani]], written by Gen Urobuchi and features character designs by ''[[Reborn!]]'' manga artist [[Akira Amano]].

As soon as his work with the film ended, Shiotani focused on the series' quality.

Urobuchi and  Motohiro said the film would have to contain a scenario independent of Japan's Sibyl System society. Shiotani wanted to create the film in collaboration with the staff who had worked on the first season and with character designer Naoyuki Onda and art director Shuichi Kusamori, who also worked on the series.

To make the story more realistic, Shiotani decided to have the foreigners speak English, in contrast with other films in which they typically speak Japanese. Both lead actors, [[Tomokazu Seki]] (Kogami) and [[Kana Hanazawa]] (Akane), were surprised at this proposal because they had multiple English lines. Shiotani wished to explore what happens when a confined society expands into other countries, bringing chaos rather than peace, which would make the audience further question this ideal.<ref name=\"proflie\">{{cite book|title=Psycho-Pass Official Profiling 2|isbn=978-4041027691|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|year=2015}}</ref><ref name=\"myuzz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mymbuzz.com/2016/10/30/psycho-pass-director-naoyoshi-shiotani-interview-mcm-london/|title=Psycho-Pass Director Naoyoshi Shiotani Interview @ MCM London|date=October 30, 2016|author=Simons, Roxy|publisher=MyM Buzz|accessdate=November 11, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418033338/http://www.mymbuzz.com/2016/10/30/psycho-pass-director-naoyoshi-shiotani-interview-mcm-london/|archivedate=April 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Shiotani chose Southeast Asia, thinking a country working hard to further its development would be fitting for the story.<ref name=\"proflie\"/>\n\nThe films ''Sinners of the System'' were first announced in Japan by [[Fuji TV]] in March 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-03-08/psycho-pass-ss-3-part-anime-film-project-revealed/.128710|title=Psycho-Pass SS 3-Part Anime Film Project Revealed (Updated)|work=Anime News Network|accessdate=November 12, 2018|date=March 8, 2018}}</ref> Shiotani returned as the films' director.

Nevertheless, he noted that this duo possessed a different dynamic due to Ginoza having undergone a notable character arc across the previous projects mainly due to his relationship with Masaoka and Kogami. Voice actress [[Ayane Sakura]] believed Shimotsuki was now more fitting for the role of a heroine thanks to her experience in the second television series where she was the youngest main character. Once the first movie premiered, Shiotani commented the trilogy would \"broaden your perspective [the audience's]. They're those kinds of movies\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://manga.tokyo/report/psycho-pass-sinners-of-the-system-case-1-opening-day-report/|title=Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System Case.1 Opening Day Report|publisher=Manga.Tokyo|accessdate=August 17, 2019|date=2019-02-19}}</ref>\n\nFor the 2019 anime series, Shiotani entrusted the writer Ubukata, Fukami and Yoshigami with handling a new cast. Fukami and Yoshikami wrote the script while Ubukata was in charge of the composition. Fukami was surprised with the ongoing dynamic between Shiotani and Ubukata as, despite the new story and character additions not included in the original series composition, the series still felt like ''Psycho-Pass''. He clarified that every episode of the new series handle a different theme based on Ubukata's writing, and the writers found writing the second half of the series challenging. In creating the new leads, [[Arata Shindo]] and [[List of Psycho-Pass characters#Kei Mikhail Ignatov|Kei Mihail Ignatov]] were handled as \"two good buddies\" while showcasing striking differences between them. Ubukata then conceived the idea of \"psychology vs. combat\" making Shindo a trained mentalist while Ignatov is former military with martial arts skills. Special attention was given to Shindo's characterization as he could come across as an unlikable character based on how he leads conversations but was still caring. Ubukata wanted the two main characters to be written solely by Fukami.<ref name=\"third\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.jlist.com/featured/psycho-pass-3-writers-commentary-translated/|publisher=Jlist|accessdate=December 23, 2019|title=Psycho-Pass 3 Writer\u2019s Commentary Translated <!-- https://moca-news.net/article/20191109/2019110900300a_/01/ -->|date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\n===Design===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Sketches of Shinya Kogami (left) by Akira Amano (right).

Akane's progression from an innocent newcomer to a mature and haunted person was one of the staff's main objectives.<ref name=\"jentonline\"/>\n\nMotohiro allowed his team to use very graphic elements, even though they could reduce female viewership. He acknowledged that the series may be too violent for a younger demographic and said that he would not want his son to watch it because of its psychological brutality.<ref name=\"interviewmothiro\"/> He added that the team did not want to make a violent series but an \"artistic series that just happened to have some violence included in it\".<ref name=\"jentonline\"/> About the amount of violence, Shiotani told Urobuchi, \"just let us deal with it.\"<ref name=\"jentonline\"/> Some of these violent scenes occur off-camera but whenever a protagonist was involved, the moment was developed to be memorable. The team twice had to remake scenes because the television station complained that they went \"overboard.\"<ref name=\"jentonline\"/>\n\nMotohiro wanted the series to counter concurrent anime trends. The use of ''[[Moe (slang)|moe]]'' (slang) was banned at staff meetings because they appreciated dramas like ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' and ''Patlabor'' that focused on conflicts between male characters. As the series was \"anti-moe,\" the team decided to avoid having Tsunemori remove her clothes and instead had Kogami do it. Nevertheless, the show attracted a female viewership because the conflict between the male characters appeared to attract the ''[[shonen ai]]'' genre fans.<ref name=\"panel\"/> Although Shiotani also wanted the series to avoid romance between male characters, he believed the fight scenes between male characters unintentionally attracted female fans.<ref name=\"panel\"/> The staff decided to focus on friendships rather than romantic relationships.<ref name=\"jentonline\"/>\n\n===Influences===\nThe series was inspired by several Western films, most notably ''[[L.A.

[[Egoist (band)|Egoist]], who composed the ending theme, had debuted on Noitamina with ''[[Guilty Crown]]''. Shiotani said they asked Egoist to record three versions of the ending theme so they could alternate them to match the episode's ending.<ref name=\"secondseasonmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://otakuusamagazine.com/Anime/News1/Noitamina-Interviews-PsychoPass-Director-5650.aspx |title=Noitamina Interviews Psycho-Pass Director |publisher=Otaku USA |date=May 8, 2014 |accessdate=May 9, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512221930/http://otakuusamagazine.com/Anime/News1/Noitamina-Interviews-PsychoPass-Director-5650.aspx |archivedate=May 12, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Across the series, time limits resulted in the ending songs being removed or replaced with instrumental versions to avoid cutting scenes from the episode.

Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. This raises the question of whether it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. An example of this occurs in the first episode when a woman is kidnapped and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's rules, the police can decompose her, but Tsunemori delays action, choosing to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. This challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime correlates with actually committing a crime. According to Anime News Network, \"We are all capable of doing bad things at times{{mdash}}should we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really all comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal\".<ref name=\"psychostream\">{{cite news|work=Anime News Network|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass/episodes-1|title=Review: Psycho-Pass Episodes 1 - 11 Streaming|accessdate=April 3, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328220114/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass/episodes-1|archivedate=March 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Psycho-Pass'' further questions the notion of overriding the individual's needs in favor of general social value by asking the audience to consider if it is morally and socially acceptable to kill individuals who may potentially commit crimes so long as we accept that the harm caused to society outweighs the harm caused to an individual who is falsely charged. In other words, the Sibyl System operates on the principles of opportunity cost and acceptable risk. Relying on the Sibyl System paradoxically creates a society which fears no crime as a whole, but individuals who personally fear the consequences of the Sibyl System's verdicts. Urobuchi himself has said that one of the series' central thematic ideas is \"fear.\" Shogo Makishima's actions stem from feeling out of place because the Sibyl System cannot accept him as he is, labeling him a deviant within the structure of society itself.<ref>{{cite news|work=Anime News Network|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2014-09-17/gen-urobuchi/.78542|title=Interview: Gen Urobuchi|date=September 17, 2014|accessdate=September 17, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917164359/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2014-09-17/gen-urobuchi/.78542|archivedate=September 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nEmotional repression is another theme explored in ''Psycho-Pass''. The identification of latent criminals is partially based on the emotions judged by society to be negative, such as sadness or anger, being scanned by the Sibyl System. Kotaku states, \"because of these scans, Psycho-Pass shows an interesting future where 'mental beauty' is as sought after as physical beauty. It is also a future where the police's job is little more than to watch the latent criminals they control\u2014because if they did any real detective work, they might start to think like the criminals they are trying to catch and thus become latent criminals themselves.\"<ref name=\"kotaku\"/> Many of the main characters feel nostalgia throughout the series. The many references to older literature, philosophy, music and theater create a \"nostalgic world building for a time before psycho-passes\".<ref name=\"psychostream\"/>\n\n==Media==\n===Anime===\n{{see also|List of Psycho-Pass episodes|List of Psycho-Pass 2 episodes|List of Psycho-Pass 3 episodes}}\n\nThe anime series produced by Production I.G. was broadcast in Japan on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[Noitamina]] programming block between October 12, 2012 and March 22, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/01.html#onair_schedule|script-title=ja:\u7b2c1\u8a71\u300c\u72af\u7f6a\u4fc2\u6570\u300d|publisher=Production I.G|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 7, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323164730/http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/01.html#onair_schedule|archivedate=March 23, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"final\">{{cite web|url=http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/22.html#onair_schedule|script-title=ja:\u7b2c22\u8a71\u300c\u5b8c\u74a7\u306a\u4e16\u754c\u300d|publisher=Production I.G|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 7, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323172746/http://www.production-ig.co.jp/works/psycho-pass/episodes/22.html#onair_schedule|archivedate=March 23, 2014}}</ref> [[Toho]] started releasing the series on DVD and Blu-ray formats on December 21, 2012.
