The station is served by [[Sydney Trains]] [[Bankstown Line|T3 Bankstown line]] services. The station was designed by [[New South Wales Government Railways]] and built from 1895 to 1915 by J. J. Scouller. It is also known as '''Canterbury Railway Station group'''. The property is owned by RailCorp (State Government). It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1109>{{cite NSW SHR|5011966|Canterbury Railway Station group|hr=01109|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:SLNSW 796184 Railway station Canterbury.jpg|thumb|Canterbury railway station in the early 20th century.]]\n\n===Bankstown line===\n''Main article: [[Bankstown railway line]]''\n\nCanterbury is located on the [[Sydenham railway station, Sydney|Sydenham]] to Bankstown Railway which was opened as far as [[Belmore railway station|Belmore]] on 1 February 1895 the same date on which the station was opened.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Canterbury |title=Canterbury Station |work=NSWrail.net |date= |access-date= }}</ref><ref name=NSWEnvironment&Heritage>{{cite NSW HD|4801100|Canterbury Railway Station Group|date=|accessdate=}}</ref> The line had its origins in Railway Commissioner Goodchap's 1882 recommendation that an additional line was needed between [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] and Liverpool to relieve traffic on the Southern Line and to encourage agriculture and suburban settlement. Lobbying by local interest groups and land speculators achieved Parliamentary approval by 1890 and construction commenced in 1892. The most important stations on the line, Belmore, Canterbury and [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]], were built with impressive near-identical brick buildings, the other intermediate stations ([[Campsie, New South Wales|Campsie]], [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales|Dulwich Hill]] and [[Hurlstone Park, New South Wales|Hurlstone Park]]) receiving more modest timber buildings (later replaced), possibly reflecting economies of the depression of the 1890s. The depression suppressed the profitability of the line and the extension to Liverpool did not proceed. However, suburban development followed in the early twentieth century, particularly during the interwar period when many War Service homes were built west of Canterbury. The line was extended to Bankstown in 1909 (and then to [[Regents Park, New South Wales|Regents Park]] in 1928, making it part of a loop line through [[Lidcombe]]), its justification by then being the servicing of suburban development.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nCanterbury Station was expanded in 1915 in conjunction with construction of the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line|Metropolitan Goods line]]. To the north of the station, lie two tracks that are part of the Goods Line. The westbound line has a platform face that has been fenced off. A platform on the eastbound line was demolished in 1995. These were previously used for raceday specials when [[Canterbury Park Racecourse]] was operating. Several sidings were located just beyond the station for stabling raceday trains.<ref name=nswshr-1109/><ref name=NSWEnvironment&Heritage/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Oakes|first1=John|title=Sydney's Forgotten Goods Railways|date=2001|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society|isbn=0-909650-54-3|page=71}}</ref>\n\nCanterbury signal box was commissioned on 13 December 1915 as part of the resignalling and track alterations of Canterbury station in preparation for the opening of the new Metropolitan Goods Line from Lidcombe via [[Enfield, New South Wales|Enfield]] Marshalling Yards to [[Rozelle]], in April 1916. The signal box was constructed with a mechanical interlocking lever frame using 68 of the 72 possible lever positions, which controlled the operation of signals and points in a set sequence.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe signal box controlled all train movements through Canterbury on both the Bankstown suburban line and Metropolitan Goods line. Through ancillary lever frames \"B\" and \"C\", the signal box controlled the storage sidings for the Canterbury Racecourse special trains and the shunting of the local goods sidings.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nTwo extensions have been added to the signal box. The western annex in 1937, and the eastern annex in 1968 to provide additional space to accommodate signalling relays, circuits and equipment. In 1994 a start was made on replacing the life expired signalling system and equipment on the Bankstown line and the Metropolitan Goods line. This resulted in the closure of Canterbury signal box on the weekend of 30\u201331 December 1996. After its closure it was sealed in its \"as closed condition\" by the Heritage Section of the [[State Rail Authority]] to preserve the building and its internal signalling equipment.<ref name=nswshr-1109/> All points (switches) at Canterbury have now been removed and signals are controlled from Sydenham Signalling Complex.\n\n==Platforms and services==\n{{Sydney Trains platform box\n|p1linename       = T3\n|p1stop           = services to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]] and the [[City Circle]]\n|p1notes          = <ref name=Timetable>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|T3}}</ref>\n|p2linename       = T3\n|p2stop           = services to [[Lidcombe railway station|Lidcombe]] and [[Liverpool railway station, Sydney|Liverpool]] via [[Bankstown railway station|Bankstown]]\n|p2notes          = <ref name=Timetable/>}}Canterbury is a minor station. All express services in the eastbound and westbound direction skip Canterbury. Exceptions are some morning peak eastbound services, which stop at most stations, but skip one or two.\n\n== Description ==\nThe complex comprises two Type 11 platform buildings: Platform 1, erected in 1895, and Platform 2, erected in 1915; an Overhead Booking Office and Concourse, erected in the late 1980s; and a Signal Box erected in 1915.<ref name=nswshr-1109/> Other structures include Platforms 1 and 2, both completed in 1895; canopies, erected in the late 1980s; an [[overbridge]], erected {{circa|1917}} and a [[footbridge]], erected in 1915 and later modified.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n===Context===\nCanterbury Railway Station consists of one wayside (Platform 2) on the south and one island (Platform 1) on the north, with both original platform buildings remaining. The northern side of the island platform is not used for passenger services. The wayside platform is accessed from the footbridge via a ramp, while the island platform is accessed by [[stairs]]. Even though Platform 1 has a ramp, it is not wheelchair accessible due to the ramp gradient and the three steps at the top of the ramp. An overhead booking office accessed from the Canterbury Road overbridge on the east and from Broughton Street on the north was rebuilt in the late 1980s.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Platform Building{{spaced endash}}Platform 1 (1895)\nExternal: Rectangular polychromatic face brick building with gabled roof and surrounding cantilevered [[awning]] clad in corrugated roof sheeting. The face brick is in stretcher bond, with dark brick walls and lighter salmon coloured bricks forming a [[Dado (architecture)|dado]], framing the upper half of the windows and doors and with a diamond pattern [[dentil]] course at the high level. The building is eight [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] in length, with the bays defined by engaged brick [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] which coincide with the awning [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]. Original [[chimneys]] with cement mouldings and terracotta flues remain but have been painted.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe [[cantilever]] awning is on filigreed steel brackets supported on decorative cement capped brick engaged piers and bolt fixings to the station building brick walls. The [[soffit]] lining is the underside of the corrugated steel roof fixed to intermediate exposed purlins. There is a decorative timber moulding at junction with brick wall. The canopy returns around the western end of the building but not the eastern or stair access end. The awning edges are finished with a decorative timber boarded valance.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe external walls rise from a projecting brick [[plinth]] (now painted) with a decorative two part cement dado moulding which frames the salmon brick dado and is continuous between door and window openings. Decorative cement window and door frames rise above the dado moulding, each with a decorative [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]].<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe original window and door openings have segmental arches and the windows feature a decorative moulded cement sill. The original timber windows were double hung with a double paned lower [[Sash window|sash]] and a multi-paned upper sash featuring coloured glass. Much of the original coloured window glass remains as well as the original [[fanlight]]s above the door openings. The doors were timber panelled.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe end brick [[gable]]s feature a [[Louver|louvre]] within a round brisk window frames in salmon coloured [[voussoir]] shaped bricks with four cement keystones.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nInternal: The building comprises a booking hall entered by a set of double doors at the bottom of the stairs; a booking office; station masters room; general waiting room; ladies waiting room and ladies toilet, a lamp room and men's toilet. The internal usage has now changed, and the toilets have modern fitouts.<ref name=nswshr-1109/> All of these facilities are now closed to the public. Passengers are directed to use a public toilet just outside the station on Broughton St at the bus terminus.\n\n;Platform Building{{spaced endash}}Platform 2 (1915)\nExternal: Rectangular face brick building with gabled corrugated steel roof and integral shallower sloped cantilevered awning. The face brick is in stretcher bond. The building is four bays in length, with the bays defined by engaged brick piers which coincide with the awning supports. The original [[chimney]] with cement mouldings and terracotta flue remains.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe cantilever awning is on standard double bowed steel brackets supported on decorative cement haunches and bolt fixings to the station building brick walls. The soffit lining is the underside of the corrugated steel roofing fixed to intermediate exposed purlins. There is a decorative timber moulding at junction with brick wall. Vertical timber boards form valances at each end of awning.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe external walls rise from a projecting brick plinth three/four courses high with a decorative dado moulding run in cement which is continuous between door and window openings. Decorative cement window and door frames rise above the dado moulding.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe original window openings feature a moulded cement sill with a scalloped fringe. The original timber windows were double hung with a single paned lower sash and a six paned upper sash featuring coloured glass, with glass louvres in the toilet windows. The original window glass as well as the upper glazing bars has been removed from all but one window. Original door openings featured fanlights matching the upper window sashes. All the original timber panelled doors have been removed.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nInternal: The building comprises a general waiting room; ladies room and ladies toilets and men's toilets. The internal usage has now changed and the toilets have modern fitouts and finishes. The waiting room and ladies room have original ripple iron ceiling, [[ceiling rose]] and plaster wall finishes.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Overhead Booking Office (late 1980s)\nThe original timber clad overhead booking office has been demolished and replaced by a new steel framed metal [[hipped roof]] structure.<ref name=nswshr-1109/> This building is used as the station office, as well as housing a small shop.\n\n;Signal Box (1915)\nExternal: Canterbury signal box is located beside the Bankstown suburban line, in the Canterbury Station precinct. It is a two-storey timber framed structure clad in \"checked and chamfered\" weather boards. It has a hipped, galvanised [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]] roof with wide [[eaves]] on all sides. The first floor (or operating level) has wood framed, sliding windows on three sides with a blank rear wall. On the eastern end of the building there is a landing, incorporating an enclosed toilet. The landing extends past the front of the building over a public walkway to a flight of metal stairs. The ground floor incorporates the interlocking room and relay room. The interlocking room has four windows in the front wall. In the rear is the relay room, featuring four windows in the rear wall. The eastern extension is flat roofed and is constructed of precast concrete panels between exposed verticals simulating timber [[weatherboard]]s. There is one door at the eastern end of this extension (2009).<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nInternal: The interior walls and ceiling of the first floor are lined with wall boards, and the timber floor is covered in [[linoleum]]. On the ground floor, the interlocking room is unlined, and the long and narrow lined relay room houses signalling relays which control the operation of signalling circuits.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Platforms (1895)\nPlatform 1 has an asphalt surface with its original brick face and a concrete edge. The northern or \"goods\" side of this platform is constructed in the same manner. Platform 2 also has its original brick face with a concrete edge.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Footbridge (1915)\nHaunched beam design consists of tapered cantilevers bearing on platform trestles and brick piers on each side support shallow beams over the railway tracks. The footbridge has been modified at a later unknown date.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Overbridge ({{circa|1917}})\nThe overbridge consists of steel girders supporting a jack arched brick and concrete deck. The girders [[Span (architecture)|span]] the Up and Down lines supported on concrete and brick abutment walls. The [[parapet]] walls are brick.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Canopies (late 1980)\nNew steel framed and metal roof clad canopies have been erected over the access stairs to the island platform and at the eastern end of the wayside station building, as well as the access ramp.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n=== Condition ===\nThe platform buildings are generally in good condition. The overhead booking office is in good condition. The Signal Box exterior is in reasonably good condition with some peeling of paint. A fire caused some internal damage to the rear wall and ceiling of the operating level and there is evidence of past white ant activity.<ref name=nswshr-1109-1635>Moonie, Jeff. 2000.</ref><ref name=nswshr-1109/> The platforms are generally in good condition. and in good condition are both the over bridge and the canopies.<ref name=nswshr-1109/> When the signal box was closed in 1996 the Heritage Section of former State Rail Authority had the building sealed in its final operating state. This action had the effect of maintaining the signal box in its as closed condition, preserving the mechanical interlocking lever frame and associated signalling equipment in a complete condition and it is therefore of high integrity. The footbridge retains its original haunched beam structure but has a new concrete floor, new [[balustrade]]s and canopy cover. The access stairs to Platform 1 are modern. The overbridge retains all of its original steel beams and jack arches as well as the brick abutments, piers and parapet walls.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Platform Building{{spaced endash}}Platform 1\nExternally, the station building retains most of the original detailing. Some windows have been modified by the insertion of fibreglass vandal-proof sheeting into the sashes, but a number of windows and fanlights retain the coloured glazing. Original roof vents have been removed, and the face brick chimneys painted. The male toilet modesty screen has been removed and three external doors have been replaced by flush doors. Internally, although the toilets have modern fixtures, a substantial amount of the original finishes remain. This includes plaster wall finishes, plaster ceilings and [[cornice]]s, ceiling roses, the ticket window framing in the booking hall, benches and cupboards in the booking office.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Platform Building{{spaced endash}}Platform 2\nExternally the station building retains most of the original detailing.

The main platform building represents the period of transition from the boom time of the 1880s to the standardisation of NSW railway building design from the 1890s onwards.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nCanterbury Railway Station is significant at the state level as the Platform 1 Building demonstrates the high level of aesthetic design of the pre-1900 standard railway buildings, which included the use of polychromatic brickwork, decorative dentil coursing, ornate awning brackets and carved bargeboards. This platform building is relatively intact and is representative of a small group of such ornate platform buildings including Marrickville and Belmore on the Bankstown Line.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe Canterbury signal box is of historical significance as it is representative of the development of railway signalling technology in the first decades of the 20th century. As it was is intact internally it is capable of providing information about the workings of a signal box of this era.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nCanterbury railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nCanterbury Railway Station has historical significance as it is one of the railway stations on the Sydenham to Bankstown Line built to relieve the crowding on the Main Southern Line and encourage agriculture and suburban growth in the late 1800s and early 20th century. The brick building on Platform 1 represents that period which marked the transition from the boom period of the 1880s to the standardisation of NSW Railways building design of the 1890s and onwards. The signal box is of historical significance because it represents railway signalling technology in use at the time of its construction in 1915.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe platform building on Platform 1 at Canterbury station has state aesthetic and technical significance because it exemplifies the particular design and style of brick island buildings erected by the NSW Railways prior to 1900 which possessed high qualities of aesthetic features such as polychromatic brickwork, dentilled brick cornices and cement mouldings which distinguish it from other platform building types.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nCanterbury signal box is technically significant as a structure purpose designed and built to house a large mechanical interlocking lever frame and its associated signalling equipment and being in \"as working\" condition is well able to demonstrate the features of a signal box of this era.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community's history.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nAt the time of its closure the signal box was fully operational and has been retained in that state, which allows the opportunity to observe early 1900s railway signalling technology in its original working environment.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe signal box building design is rare within the metropolitan area, though other examples exist in regional locations.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe building on Platform 1 is representative of the high architectural quality of a pre-1900 standard station building design. It's styling reflected the importance of the station at that time, the other important stations on the Bankstown line with the same design being Marrickville and Belmore.

The station is served by [[Sydney Trains]] [[Bankstown Line|T3 Bankstown line]] services. The station was designed by [[New South Wales Government Railways]] and built from 1895 to 1915 by J. J. Scouller. It is also known as '''Canterbury Railway Station group'''. The property is owned by RailCorp (State Government). It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1109>{{cite NSW SHR|5011966|Canterbury Railway Station group|hr=01109|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:SLNSW 796184 Railway station Canterbury.jpg|thumb|Canterbury railway station in the early 20th century.]]\n\n===Bankstown line===\n''Main article: [[Bankstown railway line]]''\n\nCanterbury is located on the [[Sydenham railway station, Sydney|Sydenham]] to Bankstown Railway which was opened as far as [[Belmore railway station|Belmore]] on 1 February 1895 the same date on which the station was opened.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Canterbury |title=Canterbury Station |work=NSWrail.net |date= |access-date= }}</ref><ref name=NSWEnvironment&Heritage>{{cite NSW HD|4801100|Canterbury Railway Station Group|date=|accessdate=}}</ref> The line had its origins in Railway Commissioner Goodchap's 1882 recommendation that an additional line was needed between [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] and Liverpool to relieve traffic on the Southern Line and to encourage agriculture and suburban settlement. Lobbying by local interest groups and land speculators achieved Parliamentary approval by 1890 and construction commenced in 1892. The most important stations on the line, Belmore, Canterbury and [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]], were built with impressive near-identical brick buildings, the other intermediate stations ([[Campsie, New South Wales|Campsie]], [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales|Dulwich Hill]] and [[Hurlstone Park, New South Wales|Hurlstone Park]]) receiving more modest timber buildings (later replaced), possibly reflecting economies of the depression of the 1890s. The depression suppressed the profitability of the line and the extension to Liverpool did not proceed. However, suburban development followed in the early twentieth century, particularly during the interwar period when many War Service homes were built west of Canterbury. The line was extended to Bankstown in 1909 (and then to [[Regents Park, New South Wales|Regents Park]] in 1928, making it part of a loop line through [[Lidcombe]]), its justification by then being the servicing of suburban development.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nCanterbury Station was expanded in 1915 in conjunction with construction of the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line|Metropolitan Goods line]]. To the north of the station, lie two tracks that are part of the Goods Line. The westbound line has a platform face that has been fenced off. A platform on the eastbound line was demolished in 1995. These were previously used for raceday specials when [[Canterbury Park Racecourse]] was operating. Several sidings were located just beyond the station for stabling raceday trains.<ref name=nswshr-1109/><ref name=NSWEnvironment&Heritage/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Oakes|first1=John|title=Sydney's Forgotten Goods Railways|date=2001|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society|isbn=0-909650-54-3|page=71}}</ref>\n\nCanterbury signal box was commissioned on 13 December 1915 as part of the resignalling and track alterations of Canterbury station in preparation for the opening of the new Metropolitan Goods Line from Lidcombe via [[Enfield, New South Wales|Enfield]] Marshalling Yards to [[Rozelle]], in April 1916. The signal box was constructed with a mechanical interlocking lever frame using 68 of the 72 possible lever positions, which controlled the operation of signals and points in a set sequence.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe signal box controlled all train movements through Canterbury on both the Bankstown suburban line and Metropolitan Goods line. Through ancillary lever frames \"B\" and \"C\", the signal box controlled the storage sidings for the Canterbury Racecourse special trains and the shunting of the local goods sidings.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nTwo extensions have been added to the signal box. The western annex in 1937, and the eastern annex in 1968 to provide additional space to accommodate signalling relays, circuits and equipment. In 1994 a start was made on replacing the life expired signalling system and equipment on the Bankstown line and the Metropolitan Goods line. This resulted in the closure of Canterbury signal box on the weekend of 30\u201331 December 1996. After its closure it was sealed in its \"as closed condition\" by the Heritage Section of the [[State Rail Authority]] to preserve the building and its internal signalling equipment.<ref name=nswshr-1109/> All points (switches) at Canterbury have now been removed and signals are controlled from Sydenham Signalling Complex.\n\n==Platforms and services==\n{{Sydney Trains platform box\n|p1linename       = T3\n|p1stop           = services to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]] and the [[City Circle]]\n|p1notes          = <ref name=Timetable>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|T3}}</ref>\n|p2linename       = T3\n|p2stop           = services to [[Lidcombe railway station|Lidcombe]] and [[Liverpool railway station, Sydney|Liverpool]] via [[Bankstown railway station|Bankstown]]\n|p2notes          = <ref name=Timetable/>}}Canterbury is a minor station.

Exceptions are some morning peak eastbound services, which stop at most stations, but skip one or two.\n\n== Description ==\nThe complex comprises two Type 11 platform buildings: Platform 1, erected in 1895, and Platform 2, erected in 1915; an Overhead Booking Office and Concourse, erected in the late 1980s; and a Signal Box erected in 1915.<ref name=nswshr-1109/> Other structures include Platforms 1 and 2, both completed in 1895; canopies, erected in the late 1980s; an [[overbridge]], erected {{circa|1917}} and a [[footbridge]], erected in 1915 and later modified.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n===Context===\nCanterbury Railway Station consists of one wayside (Platform 2) on the south and one island (Platform 1) on the north, with both original platform buildings remaining. The northern side of the island platform is not used for passenger services. The wayside platform is accessed from the footbridge via a ramp, while the island platform is accessed by [[stairs]]. Even though Platform 1 has a ramp, it is not wheelchair accessible due to the ramp gradient and the three steps at the top of the ramp. An overhead booking office accessed from the Canterbury Road overbridge on the east and from Broughton Street on the north was rebuilt in the late 1980s.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Platform Building{{spaced endash}}Platform 1 (1895)\nExternal: Rectangular polychromatic face brick building with gabled roof and surrounding cantilevered [[awning]] clad in corrugated roof sheeting. The face brick is in stretcher bond, with dark brick walls and lighter salmon coloured bricks forming a [[Dado (architecture)|dado]], framing the upper half of the windows and doors and with a diamond pattern [[dentil]] course at the high level. The building is eight [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] in length, with the bays defined by engaged brick [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] which coincide with the awning [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]. Original [[chimneys]] with cement mouldings and terracotta flues remain but have been painted.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe [[cantilever]] awning is on filigreed steel brackets supported on decorative cement capped brick engaged piers and bolt fixings to the station building brick walls. The [[soffit]] lining is the underside of the corrugated steel roof fixed to intermediate exposed purlins. There is a decorative timber moulding at junction with brick wall. The canopy returns around the western end of the building but not the eastern or stair access end. The awning edges are finished with a decorative timber boarded valance.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe external walls rise from a projecting brick [[plinth]] (now painted) with a decorative two part cement dado moulding which frames the salmon brick dado and is continuous between door and window openings. Decorative cement window and door frames rise above the dado moulding, each with a decorative [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]].<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe original window and door openings have segmental arches and the windows feature a decorative moulded cement sill. The original timber windows were double hung with a double paned lower [[Sash window|sash]] and a multi-paned upper sash featuring coloured glass. Much of the original coloured window glass remains as well as the original [[fanlight]]s above the door openings. The doors were timber panelled.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe end brick [[gable]]s feature a [[Louver|louvre]] within a round brisk window frames in salmon coloured [[voussoir]] shaped bricks with four cement keystones.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nInternal: The building comprises a booking hall entered by a set of double doors at the bottom of the stairs; a booking office; station masters room; general waiting room; ladies waiting room and ladies toilet, a lamp room and men's toilet. The internal usage has now changed, and the toilets have modern fitouts.<ref name=nswshr-1109/> All of these facilities are now closed to the public. Passengers are directed to use a public toilet just outside the station on Broughton St at the bus terminus.\n\n;Platform Building{{spaced endash}}Platform 2 (1915)\nExternal: Rectangular face brick building with gabled corrugated steel roof and integral shallower sloped cantilevered awning. The face brick is in stretcher bond. The building is four bays in length, with the bays defined by engaged brick piers which coincide with the awning supports. The original [[chimney]] with cement mouldings and terracotta flue remains.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe cantilever awning is on standard double bowed steel brackets supported on decorative cement haunches and bolt fixings to the station building brick walls. The soffit lining is the underside of the corrugated steel roofing fixed to intermediate exposed purlins. There is a decorative timber moulding at junction with brick wall. Vertical timber boards form valances at each end of awning.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe external walls rise from a projecting brick plinth three/four courses high with a decorative dado moulding run in cement which is continuous between door and window openings. Decorative cement window and door frames rise above the dado moulding.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe original window openings feature a moulded cement sill with a scalloped fringe. The original timber windows were double hung with a single paned lower sash and a six paned upper sash featuring coloured glass, with glass louvres in the toilet windows. The original window glass as well as the upper glazing bars has been removed from all but one window. Original door openings featured fanlights matching the upper window sashes. All the original timber panelled doors have been removed.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nInternal: The building comprises a general waiting room; ladies room and ladies toilets and men's toilets. The internal usage has now changed and the toilets have modern fitouts and finishes. The waiting room and ladies room have original ripple iron ceiling, [[ceiling rose]] and plaster wall finishes.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Overhead Booking Office (late 1980s)\nThe original timber clad overhead booking office has been demolished and replaced by a new steel framed metal [[hipped roof]] structure.<ref name=nswshr-1109/> This building is used as the station office, as well as housing a small shop.\n\n;Signal Box (1915)\nExternal: Canterbury signal box is located beside the Bankstown suburban line, in the Canterbury Station precinct. It is a two-storey timber framed structure clad in \"checked and chamfered\" weather boards. It has a hipped, galvanised [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron]] roof with wide [[eaves]] on all sides. The first floor (or operating level) has wood framed, sliding windows on three sides with a blank rear wall. On the eastern end of the building there is a landing, incorporating an enclosed toilet. The landing extends past the front of the building over a public walkway to a flight of metal stairs. The ground floor incorporates the interlocking room and relay room. The interlocking room has four windows in the front wall. In the rear is the relay room, featuring four windows in the rear wall. The eastern extension is flat roofed and is constructed of precast concrete panels between exposed verticals simulating timber [[weatherboard]]s. There is one door at the eastern end of this extension (2009).<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nInternal: The interior walls and ceiling of the first floor are lined with wall boards, and the timber floor is covered in [[linoleum]]. On the ground floor, the interlocking room is unlined, and the long and narrow lined relay room houses signalling relays which control the operation of signalling circuits.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Platforms (1895)\nPlatform 1 has an asphalt surface with its original brick face and a concrete edge. The northern or \"goods\" side of this platform is constructed in the same manner. Platform 2 also has its original brick face with a concrete edge.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Footbridge (1915)\nHaunched beam design consists of tapered cantilevers bearing on platform trestles and brick piers on each side support shallow beams over the railway tracks. The footbridge has been modified at a later unknown date.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Overbridge ({{circa|1917}})\nThe overbridge consists of steel girders supporting a jack arched brick and concrete deck. The girders [[Span (architecture)|span]] the Up and Down lines supported on concrete and brick abutment walls. The [[parapet]] walls are brick.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Canopies (late 1980)\nNew steel framed and metal roof clad canopies have been erected over the access stairs to the island platform and at the eastern end of the wayside station building, as well as the access ramp.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n=== Condition ===\nThe platform buildings are generally in good condition. The overhead booking office is in good condition. The Signal Box exterior is in reasonably good condition with some peeling of paint. A fire caused some internal damage to the rear wall and ceiling of the operating level and there is evidence of past white ant activity.<ref name=nswshr-1109-1635>Moonie, Jeff. 2000.</ref><ref name=nswshr-1109/> The platforms are generally in good condition. and in good condition are both the over bridge and the canopies.<ref name=nswshr-1109/> When the signal box was closed in 1996 the Heritage Section of former State Rail Authority had the building sealed in its final operating state. This action had the effect of maintaining the signal box in its as closed condition, preserving the mechanical interlocking lever frame and associated signalling equipment in a complete condition and it is therefore of high integrity. The footbridge retains its original haunched beam structure but has a new concrete floor, new [[balustrade]]s and canopy cover. The access stairs to Platform 1 are modern. The overbridge retains all of its original steel beams and jack arches as well as the brick abutments, piers and parapet walls.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n;Platform Building{{spaced endash}}Platform 1\nExternally, the station building retains most of the original detailing. Some windows have been modified by the insertion of fibreglass vandal-proof sheeting into the sashes, but a number of windows and fanlights retain the coloured glazing. Original roof vents have been removed, and the face brick chimneys painted. The male toilet modesty screen has been removed and three external doors have been replaced by flush doors. Internally, although the toilets have modern fixtures, a substantial amount of the original finishes remain.

The main platform building represents the period of transition from the boom time of the 1880s to the standardisation of NSW railway building design from the 1890s onwards.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nCanterbury Railway Station is significant at the state level as the Platform 1 Building demonstrates the high level of aesthetic design of the pre-1900 standard railway buildings, which included the use of polychromatic brickwork, decorative dentil coursing, ornate awning brackets and carved bargeboards. This platform building is relatively intact and is representative of a small group of such ornate platform buildings including Marrickville and Belmore on the Bankstown Line.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nThe Canterbury signal box is of historical significance as it is representative of the development of railway signalling technology in the first decades of the 20th century. As it was is intact internally it is capable of providing information about the workings of a signal box of this era.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nCanterbury railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nCanterbury Railway Station has historical significance as it is one of the railway stations on the Sydenham to Bankstown Line built to relieve the crowding on the Main Southern Line and encourage agriculture and suburban growth in the late 1800s and early 20th century. The brick building on Platform 1 represents that period which marked the transition from the boom period of the 1880s to the standardisation of NSW Railways building design of the 1890s and onwards. The signal box is of historical significance because it represents railway signalling technology in use at the time of its construction in 1915.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe platform building on Platform 1 at Canterbury station has state aesthetic and technical significance because it exemplifies the particular design and style of brick island buildings erected by the NSW Railways prior to 1900 which possessed high qualities of aesthetic features such as polychromatic brickwork, dentilled brick cornices and cement mouldings which distinguish it from other platform building types.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\nCanterbury signal box is technically significant as a structure purpose designed and built to house a large mechanical interlocking lever frame and its associated signalling equipment and being in \"as working\" condition is well able to demonstrate the features of a signal box of this era.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place and can provide a connection to the local community's history.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nAt the time of its closure the signal box was fully operational and has been retained in that state, which allows the opportunity to observe early 1900s railway signalling technology in its original working environment.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe signal box building design is rare within the metropolitan area, though other examples exist in regional locations.<ref name=nswshr-1109/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe building on Platform 1 is representative of the high architectural quality of a pre-1900 standard station building design.

Once the technique is mastered, a high wheeler can be mounted and dismounted easily on flat ground and some hills.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nAn attribute of the penny-farthing is that the rider sits high and nearly over the front axle. When the wheel strikes rocks and ruts, or under hard braking, the rider can be pitched forward off the bicycle head-first. Headers were relatively common and a significant, sometimes fatal, hazard. Riders coasting down hills often took their feet off the pedals and put them over the tops of the handlebars, so they would be pitched off feet-first instead of head-first.<ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite book\n| title = Bicycling Science\n| url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780262731546\n| url-access = registration\n| edition = Third\n| last = Wilson\n| first = David Gordon\n|author2=Jim Papadopoulos\n| year = 2004\n| publisher = The MIT Press\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780262731546/page/22 22]\n| quote = Whatton bars were handlebars that came under the legs from behind, so that in the event of a pitch forward the rider could land feet first.\n| isbn = 0-262-73154-1}}</ref>\n\nPenny-farthing bicycles often used similar materials and construction as earlier velocipedes: cast iron frames, solid rubber tires, and [[plain bearing]]s for pedals, steering, and wheels. They were often quite durable and required little service. For example, when cyclist [[Thomas Stevens (cyclist)|Thomas Stevens]] rode around the world in the 1880s, he reported only one significant mechanical problem in over {{convert|20000|km|mile}}, caused when the local military confiscated his bicycle and damaged the front wheel.\n\n=== End of an era ===\n\nThe well-known dangers of the penny-farthing<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Herlihy\n | first = David V.\n | authorlink = \n | title = Bicycle: the History\n | publisher = Yale University Press\n | year = 2004\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/bicyclehistory0000herl/page/226 226]\n | url = https://archive.org/details/bicyclehistory0000herl/page/226\n | isbn = 0-300-10418-9\n}}</ref> were, for the time of its prominence, outweighed by its strengths. While it was a difficult, dangerous machine, it was simpler, lighter, and faster than the safer velocipedes of the time. Two new developments changed this situation, and led to the rise of the safety bicycle. The first was the chain drive, originally used on tricycles, allowing a [[gear ratio]] to be chosen independent of the wheel size. The second was the pneumatic [[bicycle tire]], allowing smaller wheels to provide a smooth ride.\n[[File:L-Hochrad.png|thumb|An 1880 penny-farthing (left), and the first modern bicycle, [[John Kemp Starley|J.

In 1885, Starley's nephew [[John Kemp Starley]] took these new developments to launch the modern bicycle, the [[Rover_Company#Before_cars|Rover]] [[safety bicycle]], so-called because the rider, seated much lower and farther behind the front wheel contact point, was less prone to a header.<ref name=Herlihy/><ref>{{cite news|title=Cycle market: Moving into the fast lane|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/cycle-market-moving-into-the-fast-lane-1702191.html|agency=The Independent|date=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1888, when [[John Boyd Dunlop|John Dunlop]] re-invented the pneumatic tire for his son's tricycle, the high wheel was made obsolete.

Instead of using [[Bicycle gearing|gears]] to multiply the revolutions of the pedals, the driven wheel is enlarged to be close to the rider's [[inseam]], to increase the maximum speed. This shifts the rider nearly on top of the wheel and makes it impossible for the rider to reach the ground while sitting on the seat.<ref name=Herlihy/>\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nThe frame is a single tube following the circumference of the front wheel, then diverting to a trailing wheel. A mounting peg is above the rear wheel. The front wheel is in a rigid fork with little if any [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Trail|trail]]. A [[Bicycle brake systems#Spoon brakes|spoon brake]] is usually fitted on the fork crown, operated by a lever from one of the [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]]. The bars are usually mustache shaped, dropping from the level of the [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]]. The [[Bicycle saddle|saddle]] mounts on the frame less than {{convert|18|in|cm}} behind the headset.\n\nOne particular model, made by [[Pope Manufacturing Company]] in 1886, weighs {{convert|36|lb|kg}}, has a 60-spoke {{convert|53|inch|cm|adj=on}} front wheel and a 20-spoke {{convert|18|inch|cm|adj=on}} rear wheel. It is fitted with solid rubber tires. The rims, frame, fork, and handlebars are made from hollow, [[steel]] tubing. The steel axles are mounted in adjustable [[ball bearing]]s.

Once the technique is mastered, a high wheeler can be mounted and dismounted easily on flat ground and some hills.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nAn attribute of the penny-farthing is that the rider sits high and nearly over the front axle. When the wheel strikes rocks and ruts, or under hard braking, the rider can be pitched forward off the bicycle head-first. Headers were relatively common and a significant, sometimes fatal, hazard. Riders coasting down hills often took their feet off the pedals and put them over the tops of the handlebars, so they would be pitched off feet-first instead of head-first.<ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite book\n| title = Bicycling Science\n| url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780262731546\n| url-access = registration\n| edition = Third\n| last = Wilson\n| first = David Gordon\n|author2=Jim Papadopoulos\n| year = 2004\n| publisher = The MIT Press\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780262731546/page/22 22]\n| quote = Whatton bars were handlebars that came under the legs from behind, so that in the event of a pitch forward the rider could land feet first.\n| isbn = 0-262-73154-1}}</ref>\n\nPenny-farthing bicycles often used similar materials and construction as earlier velocipedes: cast iron frames, solid rubber tires, and [[plain bearing]]s for pedals, steering, and wheels. They were often quite durable and required little service. For example, when cyclist [[Thomas Stevens (cyclist)|Thomas Stevens]] rode around the world in the 1880s, he reported only one significant mechanical problem in over {{convert|20000|km|mile}}, caused when the local military confiscated his bicycle and damaged the front wheel.\n\n=== End of an era ===\n\nThe well-known dangers of the penny-farthing<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Herlihy\n | first = David V.\n | authorlink = \n | title = Bicycle: the History\n | publisher = Yale University Press\n | year = 2004\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/bicyclehistory0000herl/page/226 226]\n | url = https://archive.org/details/bicyclehistory0000herl/page/226\n | isbn = 0-300-10418-9\n}}</ref> were, for the time of its prominence, outweighed by its strengths. While it was a difficult, dangerous machine, it was simpler, lighter, and faster than the safer velocipedes of the time. Two new developments changed this situation, and led to the rise of the safety bicycle. The first was the chain drive, originally used on tricycles, allowing a [[gear ratio]] to be chosen independent of the wheel size. The second was the pneumatic [[bicycle tire]], allowing smaller wheels to provide a smooth ride.\n[[File:L-Hochrad.png|thumb|An 1880 penny-farthing (left), and the first modern bicycle, [[John Kemp Starley|J.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

By a series of well-made marriages, she rose to the highest levels of English nobility and became enormously wealthy. Bess was a shrewd business woman, increasing her assets with business interests including mines and glass-making workshops.\n\nShe was married four times. Her first husband was Robert Barlow, who died aged about 14 or 15 on 24 December 1544.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KToqD1c60PoC&pg=PA128 |title=The Elizabethans |last=Wilson |first=A. N. |date=2012-04-24 |publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux |isbn=9781466816190 |language=en}}</ref> Her second husband was the courtier [[William Cavendish (courtier)|Sir William Cavendish]]. Her third husband was [[Sir William St Loe]]. Her last husband was  [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]], sometime keeper to the captive [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. An accomplished [[needlework|needlewoman]], Bess joined her husband's captive charge at [[Chatsworth House]] for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on the [[Oxburgh Hangings]].\n\nIn 1601, Bess ordered an inventory of the household furnishings, including [[textile]]s, at her three properties at Chatsworth, Hardwick, and Chelsea, which survives. In her will she bequeathed these items to her heirs to be preserved in perpetuity. The 400-year-old collection, now known as the Hardwick Hall textiles, is the largest collection of [[tapestry]], [[embroidery]], [[canvaswork]], and other textiles to have been preserved by a single private family. Bess is also well known for her building projects, the most famous of which are [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]], now the seat of the [[Dukes of Devonshire]] (whose family name is Cavendish as they descend from the children of her second marriage), and [[Hardwick Hall]].\n\n==Origins==\nElizabeth Hardwick was the daughter of John Hardwick of [[Derbyshire]] by his wife Elizabeth Leeke, daughter of Thomas Leeke and Margaret Fox.<ref>[[Mary S. Lovell]]: ''Bess of Hardwick''</ref> Her exact birthdate is unknown, occurring in the period 1521 to 1527; that said, according to her witness statement under oath<ref>Public record Office, Kew; C1/1101</ref> at a court hearing in October 1546, in which she gives her age at the time of her first marriage in May 1543 as being 'of tender years', i.e. less than 16, would indicate 1527. It cannot be later than 1527 because of the date of her father's death, given in his Inquisition Post Mortem.<ref>PRO:E/150/743/8</ref>\n\nThe Hardwicks had arrived in Derbyshire from Sussex by the mid-thirteenth century, and farmed land granted by Robert Savage, lord of the manor of Slingsby, on the north-east border of Derbyshire, looking over Nottinghamshire. By the mid-fifteenth century the family had risen to 'gentleman-yeoman' stock, with an estate of a few hundred acres located mainly in the parish of [[Ault Hucknall]] in the manor of Slingsby. The Hardwick coat of arms of Hardwick was probably granted c. 1450 to William Hardwick. The blazon is: ''Argent, a saltier engrailed azure on a chief of the second three cinquefoils of the first''.<ref name=\"Burke's General Armory, 1884\"/> When giving evidence of his right to arms in 1569, Bess's only brother, James Hardwick (1525-1580/1), provided the heralds with a pedigree of his family which began with this William, who died c. 1453.\n\nJames was the last surviving legitimate male member of the Hardwick family. The Hardwicks were members of the minor gentry of Scarsdale; no male member of the Hardwick family rose above the status of esquire or held any important local or county offices. Bess was born into this relatively minor gentry family. Her fourth marriage to the earl of Shrewsbury in 1567 elevated her to the rank of 'countess', and following the earl's death in November 1590, Bess became one of the richest women in the kingdom. She set about building her greatest monument, [[Hardwick Hall|Hardwick New Hall]], which was completed in 1599.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Hardwick died aged about 40 leaving a widow, son (and heir), and four daughters (five daughters were alive at the time he wrote his will). His widow, Elizabeth Leeke then remarried to Ralph, the second son of the neighbouring Leche (or Leach) family of Chatsworth, in Derbyshire, by whom she would leave an additional three co-heiresses.\n\nLittle is known of Bess's early life. She appears to have been espoused to her first husband during the 1530s, and probably married for the first time in 1543. Despite the story being often repeated, there is no contemporary evidence whatsoever to support Dugdale's later claims that she became familiar with city life and the Tudor Court after being sent to live, aged twelve, in the [[London]] household of [[Anne Gainsford|Anne Gainsford, Lady Zouche]] of [[Codnor Castle]] in  Derbyshire,<ref name=\"Digby\">Digby, ''Elizabethan Embroidery'', p. 58-63</ref> where she was supposedly influenced by Lady Zouche. Despite a lack of evidence, it is possible \u2013 but no more than that \u2013 that at some point, perhaps after the death of her first husband, she entered the service of the Zouches at Codnor Castle in Derbyshire.\n\nA close family associate was a man named Henry Marmion whose family held land close to Codnor, and may have commended Bess to the Zouches who, along with the Vernons, were the only major Derbyshire family likely to have taken in such children. However, Anne Gainsford was in service in the households of [[Anne Boleyn]] and [[Jane Seymour]], and despite marrying Sir George Zouche in 1533, spent much of her time at court until after 1536, when she and Sir George made Codnor Castle their main residence. Not surprisingly, this period coincides with that Dugdale claimed Bess was in service to Anne Gainsford in London and at Codnor. However, there is no evidence to support the story, and Dugdale would have known much more about the early life of Lady Zouche than was known of Bess's origins.\n\nIt is again down to Dugdale that the story came about that from Codnor Bess entered the service of the Greys at Bradgate in Leicestershire, where she met and married her second husband, Sir [[William Cavendish (courtier)|William Cavendish]]. She certainly married Sir William at Bradgate, but that in itself does not prove that Bess was in service at Bradgate. It remains possible that she met Sir William elsewhere, possibly at Codnor.\n\n==Bess's four marriages==\n\n===First marriage===\nIn 1543, Bess married 13-year-old Robert Barley (or Barlow), heir to a neighbouring estate. The exact date of her marriage to Robert is unknown. It is thought that the marriage took place late May 1543, shortly before the death of Robert's father on 28 May, although there is no documentary evidence to substantiate this.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} There is no evidence that they lived together as man and wife.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bessofhardwickpo00dura |url-access=registration |title=Bess of Hardwick: portrait of an Elizabethan dynast |last=Durant |first=David N. |date=January 1978 |publisher=Atheneum Publishers |language=en | page=[https://archive.org/details/bessofhardwickpo00dura/page/9 9]}}</ref> Robert died in December 1544. There was no issue from the marriage, which had been arranged locally, probably initially to protect the Barley patrimony and to mitigate the impact of wardship on the Barley estate should Robert succeed his father as an underage heir. The traditional story that Robert and Bess met in London while in the service of a \"Lady Zouche\" is based on oral history, which can only be dated to the late seventeenth century (some eighty years after Bess's death). The marital claims to Robert's estate were disputed, and following his death Bess was refused dower by Peter Freschevile. A court battle ensued, which resulted in Bess being awarded her claim on the Barley estate and compensation, albeit several years after Robert's death.\n\n===Second marriage===\n[[File:Cavendish arms.svg|thumb|200px|Arms of Cavendish: ''Sable, three buck's heads cabossed argent''<ref>''Debrett's Peerage'', 1968, p.355, Duke of Devonshire</ref>]]\nOn 20 August 1547, Bess married the twice-widowed Sir [[William Cavendish (courtier)|William Cavendish]] (died 1557), Treasurer of the King's Chamber,<ref name=\"Digby\" /> and became '''Lady Cavendish'''. The wedding took place at two o'clock in the morning, at the home of the [[Grey family]], friends of the couple. Sir William was more than twice Bess's age and the father of two daughters. His fortune had been made following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], since as an official of the [[Court of Augmentations]] he was able to select choice properties for himself. Possibly acting on Bess's advice, Sir William sold his lands in the south of England and bought the Chatsworth estates in her home county of [[Derbyshire]]. Sir William Cavendish died on 25 October 1557, leaving Bess widowed a second time and in deep debt to the Crown. Upon his death, Bess claimed the sum of his property, having insisted that his land be settled on their heirs. \nEight children were born of the marriage, two of whom died in infancy:<ref>[http://roglo.eu/roglo?lang=en;i=4306713 Genealogy Database by Daniel de Rauglaudre] (retrieved 23 December 2012).</ref>\n\n*Frances Cavendish (18 June 1548{{snd}}January 1632), eldest child, wife of Sir [[Henry Pierrepont (MP)|Henry Pierrepont]], MP.

Her new husband was [[Captain of the Guard]] to Queen Elizabeth I and [[Chief Butler of England]]. Due to his relationship with Queen Elizabeth I, he was able to reduce the debt Bess owed and paid it back in full on her behalf.<ref name=\":1\">Lovell, M. S. (Spring 2018). Bess of Hardwick.

When he died without male issue in 1564/5, in suspicious circumstances (probably poisoned by his younger brother),<ref>[[Mary S. Lovell]]: ''Bess of Hardwick'', pp185-186</ref> he left everything to Bess, to the detriment of his daughters and brother.<ref name=\"Digby\" /> In addition to her own six surviving children, Bess was now responsible for the two daughters of Sir William St Loe from his first marriage. However, those two daughters were already adults and otherwise well provided for.\n\nSir William St Loe's death left Bess one of the wealthiest women in England. Her annual income was calculated to amount to [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]60,000, {{Inflation|UK|60000|1564|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-6}}.{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} Further, she was a [[Lady of the Bedchamber]] with daily access to the Queen, whose favour she enjoyed. Still in her late 30s, Bess retained her looks and good health, and a number of important men began courting her.\n\n===Fourth marriage===\n[[File:Talbot arms.svg|thumb|200px|Arms of Talbot: ''Gules, a lion rampant within a bordure engrailled or''<ref>Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.1015, E. of Shrewsbury & Waterford</ref>]]\nDespite being courted by several suitors, Bess did not remarry until 1568, when she married for the fourth time to become '''Countess of Shrewsbury.''' Her new husband, [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]], was one of the premier aristocrats of the realm, and the father of seven children by his first marriage. Indeed, two of his children were married to two of hers in a [[Wedding#Double wedding|double ceremony]] in February 1568: Bess's daughter [[Mary Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury|Mary Cavendish]], aged 12, was given in marriage to Shrewsbury's eldest son [[Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury|Gilbert]], aged 16; while Bess's son, Sir Henry Cavendish, aged 18, married Shrewsbury's daughter Lady Grace Talbot, aged 8.\n\nIn the year before Bess and the Earl of Shrewsbury were married, a political disturbance arose in Scotland, which would profoundly affect their lives. [[Battle of Carberry Hill|Rebel Scottish lords]] rose up against [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], imprisoned her, and forced her to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old infant son, [[James VI and I|James]]. In May 1568, Mary escaped captivity in Scotland, and fled south towards England, seeking the protection of her cousin, Queen Elizabeth. However, the English authorities were not sure how to receive her. On 18 May, she was taken into protective custody at [[Carlyle Castle|Carlisle Castle]] by local officials.\n\nQueen Elizabeth felt obliged to host and protect Mary, her cousin, against the rebellious Scottish lords. However, due to [[Mary, Queen of Scots#Claim to the English throne|Mary's persistent claim to the English throne]], Elizabeth also regarded her as a threat. Elizabeth had Mary moved to [[Bolton Castle]] in [[Yorkshire]], where she was lodged under the guard of [[Francis Knollys (the elder)|Francis Knollys]], pending the [[Casket letters#Conference at York.2C Westminster.2C and Hampton Court|York Conference]] inquiry, regarding Mary's fate. The inquiry results were inconclusive; yet Elizabeth did not set Mary free. Instead, Mary would be detained under the custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury, and his wife Bess. Elizabeth's instruction to Bess and her husband amounted to little more than Mary's house arrest. Mary reached her new residence, [[Tutbury Castle]], in February 1569, when she was 26 years old, and would remain in the custody of Shrewsbury and Bess for 15 years. Elizabeth shifted the costs of the imprisonment to Shrewsbury. It was recorded that Mary would use the couple's insecurities against each other, even convincing Talbot that Bess was stealing.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mary's presence in their home, as well as the financial costs and political tensions, may have contributed to the rift between Shrewsbury and Bess, which would lead eventually to the break-up of their marriage.<ref>Bess of Hardwick Empire Builder 2005 Mary S.

Carleton Williams, ''Bess of Hardwick'' pp 74\u201380</ref> and [[Sheffield Manor]]. Throughout this period, Bess spent time as Mary's companion, working with her on embroidery and textile projects. Indeed, all Mary's work later became part of Bess's historical collection at [[Hardwick Hall]].<ref>Lovell, 2005, pp 220\u2013221</ref> \n[[File:Bess of Hardwick as Mistress St Lo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bess of Hardwick, 1550s]] Bess joined Mary at Chatsworth for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on the [[Oxburgh Hangings]].<ref name=\"Digby\"/>\n\nIt was not until Mary was removed to another keeper, Sir [[Amias Paulet]], that she got into the trouble that would lead ultimately to  [[Mary, Queen of Scots#Death|her execution]]. Previous to the Queen's change in custody, Shrewsbury and Bess separated for good. They had been apart, off and on, since about 1580; and even Queen Elizabeth had tried to get them to reconcile. Mary seems to have aggravated, if not created, their problems by playing them off against each other. The Countess spread rumors that her husband Shrewsbury had been in a relationship with Mary, a charge which has never been proved or disproved, and in any case which she later retracted,<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Shrewsbury, Elizabeth Talbot, Countess of|volume=24|page=1017}}</ref> but seems unlikely given Shrewsbury's disposition and increasingly poor health.{{Citation needed | date=December 2013}} On his death in 1590, Bess became [[Dowager]] Countess of Shrewsbury. She lived mostly at Hardwicke, where she built the new mansion Hardwick Hall, which inspired the rhyme, \"Hardwick Hall, more glass than wall\", because of the number and size of its windows.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.architecture.com/HowWeBuiltBritain/HistoricalPeriods/TudorsAndStuarts/ProdigyHouse/HardwickHallDerbyshire.aspx |title=Royal Institute of British Architects |access-date=20 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055242/http://www.architecture.com/HowWeBuiltBritain/HistoricalPeriods/TudorsAndStuarts/ProdigyHouse/HardwickHallDerbyshire.aspx |archive-date=21 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Levey, ''Of Household Stuff'', p.10-11; Levey, ''An Elizabethan Inheritance'', p. 20-39 ''passim''</ref>  . She was indeed one of the greatest builders of her time at Hardwick, [[Chatsworth House]], and [[Oldcoates]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==The Stuart connection==\nIn 1574 Bess arranged a marriage between one of her daughters and the son of the [[Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox|Countess of Lennox]]. This was a significant match for Bess because the Countess of Lennox was Margaret Douglas, a member of the royal family, being the daughter of Margaret Tudor, Queen Dowager of Scotland and sister of Henry VIII, and therefore, also  Queen Elizabeth's first cousin. In this match, the bride was Bess's daughter, [[Elizabeth Stuart, Countess of Lennox|Elizabeth Cavendish]], and the groom was [[Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox|Charles Stuart]], who was himself also the first cousin of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], (through their grandmother, the same Margaret Tudor). The groom was also the younger brother of [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]] who had been married to Mary until his death. This marriage, therefore, enabled a claim to the throne for any of Bess's grandchildren born of the marriage. The marriage ceremony took place without the knowledge of Shrewsbury, who, though well aware of the suggested match some time prior to this event, declined to accept any responsibility. Due to the Lennox family's claim to the throne, the marriage was considered potentially treasonable, since Queen Elizabeth's consent had not been obtained. The Countess of Lennox, mother of the bridegroom, went to the Tower for several months, and Bess was ordered to London to face an official inquiry, but she ignored the summons, and remained in [[Sheffield Manor|Sheffield]] until the row died down. The child of the marriage was [[Arbella Stuart]], who had a claim to the thrones of [[Scotland]] and England as the second cousin to King James VI of Scotland (later King James I of England), through their great-grandmother, Margaret Tudor.\n\nArbella was at times invited to Elizabeth's court, but spent most of her time with her grandmother. A BBC documentary<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/bbb-hardwick.shtml |title=BBC Documentary Site}}</ref> showed that Bess very much desired Arbella to become Queen, even imprisoning the young lady to prevent her from eloping. Arbella blamed her grandmother for this, and the two fell out irrevocably when Arbella attempted to run away and marry a man who, as a descendant of Henry VII, also had a claim to the throne. Bess cut Arbella from her will and begged the Queen to take her granddaughter off her hands. Arbella's royal claim was never recognized. Despite disinheriting Arbella and her eldest son (Henry: for aiding Arbella's escape); she later had a \"lukewarm reconciliation with her granddaughter.<ref name=\":1\" /> Bess has been an ancestor of the royal line since 1952; [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] being Bess's descendant through the Dukes of Portland, in whose family was Elizabeth II's maternal grandmother, [[Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck]].\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:Bess of Hardwick- Derby Cathedral.JPG|thumb|Effigy of Elizabeth Hardwick wearing a [[coronet]] of a [[Earl|countess]].

By a series of well-made marriages, she rose to the highest levels of English nobility and became enormously wealthy. Bess was a shrewd business woman, increasing her assets with business interests including mines and glass-making workshops.\n\nShe was married four times. Her first husband was [[Robert Barlow]], who died aged about 14 or 15 on 24 December 1544.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KToqD1c60PoC&pg=PA128 |title=The Elizabethans |last=Wilson |first=A.

Her third husband was [[Sir William St Loe]]. Her last husband was  [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]], sometime keeper to the captive [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. An accomplished [[needlework|needlewoman]], Bess joined her husband's captive charge at [[Chatsworth House]] for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on the [[Oxburgh Hangings]].\n\nIn 1601, Bess ordered an inventory of the household furnishings, including [[textile]]s, at her three properties at Chatsworth, Hardwick, and Chelsea, which survives. In her will she bequeathed these items to her heirs to be preserved in perpetuity. The 400-year-old collection, now known as the Hardwick Hall textiles, is the largest collection of [[tapestry]], [[embroidery]], [[canvaswork]], and other textiles to have been preserved by a single private family. Bess is also well known for her building projects, the most famous of which are [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]], now the seat of the [[Dukes of Devonshire]] (whose family name is Cavendish as they descend from the children of her second marriage), and [[Hardwick Hall]].\n\n==Origins==\nElizabeth Hardwick was the daughter of John Hardwick of [[Derbyshire]] by his wife Elizabeth Leeke, daughter of Thomas Leeke and Margaret Fox.<ref>[[Mary S. Lovell]]: ''Bess of Hardwick''</ref> Her exact birthdate is unknown, occurring in the period 1521 to 1527; that said, according to her witness statement under oath<ref>Public record Office, Kew; C1/1101</ref> at a court hearing in October 1546, in which she gives her age at the time of her first marriage in May 1543 as being 'of tender years', i.e. less than 16, would indicate 1527. It cannot be later than 1527 because of the date of her father's death, given in his Inquisition Post Mortem.<ref>PRO:E/150/743/8</ref>\n\nThe Hardwicks had arrived in Derbyshire from Sussex by the mid-thirteenth century, and farmed land granted by Robert Savage, lord of the manor of Slingsby, on the north-east border of Derbyshire, looking over Nottinghamshire. By the mid-fifteenth century the family had risen to 'gentleman-yeoman' stock, with an estate of a few hundred acres located mainly in the parish of [[Ault Hucknall]] in the manor of Slingsby. The Hardwick coat of arms of Hardwick was probably granted c. 1450 to William Hardwick. The blazon is: ''Argent, a saltier engrailed azure on a chief of the second three cinquefoils of the first''.<ref name=\"Burke's General Armory, 1884\"/> When giving evidence of his right to arms in 1569, Bess's only brother, James Hardwick (1525-1580/1), provided the heralds with a pedigree of his family which began with this William, who died c. 1453.\n\nJames was the last surviving legitimate male member of the Hardwick family. The Hardwicks were members of the minor gentry of Scarsdale; no male member of the Hardwick family rose above the status of esquire or held any important local or county offices. Bess was born into this relatively minor gentry family. Her fourth marriage to the earl of Shrewsbury in 1567 elevated her to the rank of 'countess', and following the earl's death in November 1590, Bess became one of the richest women in the kingdom. She set about building her greatest monument, [[Hardwick Hall|Hardwick New Hall]], which was completed in 1599.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Hardwick died aged about 40 leaving a widow, son (and heir), and four daughters (five daughters were alive at the time he wrote his will). His widow, Elizabeth Leeke then remarried to Ralph, the second son of the neighbouring Leche (or Leach) family of Chatsworth, in Derbyshire, by whom she would leave an additional three co-heiresses.\n\nLittle is known of Bess's early life. She appears to have been espoused to her first husband during the 1530s, and probably married for the first time in 1543. Despite the story being often repeated, there is no contemporary evidence whatsoever to support Dugdale's later claims that she became familiar with city life and the Tudor Court after being sent to live, aged twelve, in the [[London]] household of [[Anne Gainsford|Anne Gainsford, Lady Zouche]] of [[Codnor Castle]] in  Derbyshire,<ref name=\"Digby\">Digby, ''Elizabethan Embroidery'', p. 58-63</ref> where she was supposedly influenced by Lady Zouche. Despite a lack of evidence, it is possible \u2013 but no more than that \u2013 that at some point, perhaps after the death of her first husband, she entered the service of the Zouches at Codnor Castle in Derbyshire.\n\nA close family associate was a man named Henry Marmion whose family held land close to Codnor, and may have commended Bess to the Zouches who, along with the Vernons, were the only major Derbyshire family likely to have taken in such children. However, Anne Gainsford was in service in the households of [[Anne Boleyn]] and [[Jane Seymour]], and despite marrying Sir George Zouche in 1533, spent much of her time at court until after 1536, when she and Sir George made Codnor Castle their main residence. Not surprisingly, this period coincides with that Dugdale claimed Bess was in service to Anne Gainsford in London and at Codnor. However, there is no evidence to support the story, and Dugdale would have known much more about the early life of Lady Zouche than was known of Bess's origins.\n\nIt is again down to Dugdale that the story came about that from Codnor Bess entered the service of the Greys at Bradgate in Leicestershire, where she met and married her second husband, Sir [[William Cavendish (courtier)|William Cavendish]]. She certainly married Sir William at Bradgate, but that in itself does not prove that Bess was in service at Bradgate. It remains possible that she met Sir William elsewhere, possibly at Codnor.\n\n==Bess's four marriages==\n\n===First marriage===\nIn 1543, Bess married 13-year-old Robert Barley (or Barlow), heir to a neighbouring estate. The exact date of her marriage to Robert is unknown. It is thought that the marriage took place late May 1543, shortly before the death of Robert's father on 28 May, although there is no documentary evidence to substantiate this.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} There is no evidence that they lived together as man and wife.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bessofhardwickpo00dura |url-access=registration |title=Bess of Hardwick: portrait of an Elizabethan dynast |last=Durant |first=David N. |date=January 1978 |publisher=Atheneum Publishers |language=en | page=[https://archive.org/details/bessofhardwickpo00dura/page/9 9]}}</ref> Robert died in December 1544. There was no issue from the marriage, which had been arranged locally, probably initially to protect the Barley patrimony and to mitigate the impact of wardship on the Barley estate should Robert succeed his father as an underage heir. The traditional story that Robert and Bess met in London while in the service of a \"Lady Zouche\" is based on oral history, which can only be dated to the late seventeenth century (some eighty years after Bess's death). The marital claims to Robert's estate were disputed, and following his death Bess was refused dower by Peter Freschevile. A court battle ensued, which resulted in Bess being awarded her claim on the Barley estate and compensation, albeit several years after Robert's death.\n\n===Second marriage===\n[[File:Cavendish arms.svg|thumb|200px|Arms of Cavendish: ''Sable, three buck's heads cabossed argent''<ref>''Debrett's Peerage'', 1968, p.355, Duke of Devonshire</ref>]]\nOn 20 August 1547, Bess married the twice-widowed Sir [[William Cavendish (courtier)|William Cavendish]] (died 1557), Treasurer of the King's Chamber,<ref name=\"Digby\" /> and became '''Lady Cavendish'''. The wedding took place at two o'clock in the morning, at the home of the [[Grey family]], friends of the couple. Sir William was more than twice Bess's age and the father of two daughters. His fortune had been made following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], since as an official of the [[Court of Augmentations]] he was able to select choice properties for himself. Possibly acting on Bess's advice, Sir William sold his lands in the south of England and bought the Chatsworth estates in her home county of [[Derbyshire]]. Sir William Cavendish died on 25 October 1557, leaving Bess widowed a second time and in deep debt to the Crown. Upon his death, Bess claimed the sum of his property, having insisted that his land be settled on their heirs. \nEight children were born of the marriage, two of whom died in infancy:<ref>[http://roglo.eu/roglo?lang=en;i=4306713 Genealogy Database by Daniel de Rauglaudre] (retrieved 23 December 2012).</ref>\n\n*Frances Cavendish (18 June 1548{{snd}}January 1632), eldest child, wife of Sir [[Henry Pierrepont (MP)|Henry Pierrepont]], MP.

Her new husband was [[Captain of the Guard]] to Queen Elizabeth I and [[Chief Butler of England]]. Due to his relationship with Queen Elizabeth I, he was able to reduce the debt Bess owed and paid it back in full on her behalf.<ref name=\":1\">Lovell, M. S. (Spring 2018). Bess of Hardwick.

When he died without male issue in 1564/5, in suspicious circumstances (probably poisoned by his younger brother),<ref>[[Mary S. Lovell]]: ''Bess of Hardwick'', pp185-186</ref> he left everything to Bess, to the detriment of his daughters and brother.<ref name=\"Digby\" /> In addition to her own six surviving children, Bess was now responsible for the two daughters of Sir William St Loe from his first marriage. However, those two daughters were already adults and otherwise well provided for.\n\nSir William St Loe's death left Bess one of the wealthiest women in England. Her annual income was calculated to amount to [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]60,000, {{Inflation|UK|60000|1564|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-6}}.{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} Further, she was a [[Lady of the Bedchamber]] with daily access to the Queen, whose favour she enjoyed. Still in her late 30s, Bess retained her looks and good health, and a number of important men began courting her.\n\n===Fourth marriage===\n[[File:Talbot arms.svg|thumb|200px|Arms of Talbot: ''Gules, a lion rampant within a bordure engrailled or''<ref>Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.1015, E. of Shrewsbury & Waterford</ref>]]\nDespite being courted by several suitors, Bess did not remarry until 1568, when she married for the fourth time to become '''Countess of Shrewsbury.''' Her new husband, [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]], was one of the premier aristocrats of the realm, and the father of seven children by his first marriage. Indeed, two of his children were married to two of hers in a [[Wedding#Double wedding|double ceremony]] in February 1568: Bess's daughter [[Mary Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury|Mary Cavendish]], aged 12, was given in marriage to Shrewsbury's eldest son [[Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury|Gilbert]], aged 16; while Bess's son, Sir Henry Cavendish, aged 18, married Shrewsbury's daughter Lady Grace Talbot, aged 8.\n\nIn the year before Bess and the Earl of Shrewsbury were married, a political disturbance arose in Scotland, which would profoundly affect their lives. [[Battle of Carberry Hill|Rebel Scottish lords]] rose up against [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], imprisoned her, and forced her to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old infant son, [[James VI and I|James]]. In May 1568, Mary escaped captivity in Scotland, and fled south towards England, seeking the protection of her cousin, Queen Elizabeth. However, the English authorities were not sure how to receive her. On 18 May, she was taken into protective custody at [[Carlyle Castle|Carlisle Castle]] by local officials.\n\nQueen Elizabeth felt obliged to host and protect Mary, her cousin, against the rebellious Scottish lords. However, due to [[Mary, Queen of Scots#Claim to the English throne|Mary's persistent claim to the English throne]], Elizabeth also regarded her as a threat. Elizabeth had Mary moved to [[Bolton Castle]] in [[Yorkshire]], where she was lodged under the guard of [[Francis Knollys (the elder)|Francis Knollys]], pending the [[Casket letters#Conference at York.2C Westminster.2C and Hampton Court|York Conference]] inquiry, regarding Mary's fate. The inquiry results were inconclusive; yet Elizabeth did not set Mary free. Instead, Mary would be detained under the custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury, and his wife Bess. Elizabeth's instruction to Bess and her husband amounted to little more than Mary's house arrest. Mary reached her new residence, [[Tutbury Castle]], in February 1569, when she was 26 years old, and would remain in the custody of Shrewsbury and Bess for 15 years. Elizabeth shifted the costs of the imprisonment to Shrewsbury. It was recorded that Mary would use the couple's insecurities against each other, even convincing Talbot that Bess was stealing.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mary's presence in their home, as well as the financial costs and political tensions, may have contributed to the rift between Shrewsbury and Bess, which would lead eventually to the break-up of their marriage.<ref>Bess of Hardwick Empire Builder 2005 Mary S. Lovell p 210.</ref><ref>Roderick Graham (2009) ''The Life of Mary Queen of Scots.''  pp 314\u2013316</ref>\n\nWhile in the care of the earl and countess, Queen Mary lived at one or another of their many houses in the [[The Midlands, England|Midlands]]: [[Tutbury Castle|Tutbury]], [[Wingfield Manor]], [[Chatsworth House]],<ref>E. Carleton Williams, ''Bess of Hardwick'' pp 74\u201380</ref> and [[Sheffield Manor]]. Throughout this period, Bess spent time as Mary's companion, working with her on embroidery and textile projects. Indeed, all Mary's work later became part of Bess's historical collection at [[Hardwick Hall]].<ref>Lovell, 2005, pp 220\u2013221</ref> \n[[File:Bess of Hardwick as Mistress St Lo.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bess of Hardwick, 1550s]] Bess joined Mary at Chatsworth for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on the [[Oxburgh Hangings]].<ref name=\"Digby\"/>\n\nIt was not until Mary was removed to another keeper, Sir [[Amias Paulet]], that she got into the trouble that would lead ultimately to  [[Mary, Queen of Scots#Death|her execution]]. Previous to the Queen's change in custody, Shrewsbury and Bess separated for good. They had been apart, off and on, since about 1580; and even Queen Elizabeth had tried to get them to reconcile. Mary seems to have aggravated, if not created, their problems by playing them off against each other. The Countess spread rumors that her husband Shrewsbury had been in a relationship with Mary, a charge which has never been proved or disproved, and in any case which she later retracted,<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Shrewsbury, Elizabeth Talbot, Countess of|volume=24|page=1017}}</ref> but seems unlikely given Shrewsbury's disposition and increasingly poor health.{{Citation needed | date=December 2013}} On his death in 1590, Bess became [[Dowager]] Countess of Shrewsbury. She lived mostly at Hardwicke, where she built the new mansion Hardwick Hall, which inspired the rhyme, \"Hardwick Hall, more glass than wall\", because of the number and size of its windows.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.architecture.com/HowWeBuiltBritain/HistoricalPeriods/TudorsAndStuarts/ProdigyHouse/HardwickHallDerbyshire.aspx |title=Royal Institute of British Architects |access-date=20 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055242/http://www.architecture.com/HowWeBuiltBritain/HistoricalPeriods/TudorsAndStuarts/ProdigyHouse/HardwickHallDerbyshire.aspx |archive-date=21 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Levey, ''Of Household Stuff'', p.10-11; Levey, ''An Elizabethan Inheritance'', p. 20-39 ''passim''</ref>  . She was indeed one of the greatest builders of her time at Hardwick, [[Chatsworth House]], and [[Oldcoates]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==The Stuart connection==\nIn 1574 Bess arranged a marriage between one of her daughters and the son of the [[Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox|Countess of Lennox]]. This was a significant match for Bess because the Countess of Lennox was Margaret Douglas, a member of the royal family, being the daughter of Margaret Tudor, Queen Dowager of Scotland and sister of Henry VIII, and therefore, also  Queen Elizabeth's first cousin. In this match, the bride was Bess's daughter, [[Elizabeth Stuart, Countess of Lennox|Elizabeth Cavendish]], and the groom was [[Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox|Charles Stuart]], who was himself also the first cousin of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], (through their grandmother, the same Margaret Tudor). The groom was also the younger brother of [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]] who had been married to Mary until his death. This marriage, therefore, enabled a claim to the throne for any of Bess's grandchildren born of the marriage. The marriage ceremony took place without the knowledge of Shrewsbury, who, though well aware of the suggested match some time prior to this event, declined to accept any responsibility. Due to the Lennox family's claim to the throne, the marriage was considered potentially treasonable, since Queen Elizabeth's consent had not been obtained. The Countess of Lennox, mother of the bridegroom, went to the Tower for several months, and Bess was ordered to London to face an official inquiry, but she ignored the summons, and remained in [[Sheffield Manor|Sheffield]] until the row died down. The child of the marriage was [[Arbella Stuart]], who had a claim to the thrones of [[Scotland]] and England as the second cousin to King James VI of Scotland (later King James I of England), through their great-grandmother, Margaret Tudor.\n\nArbella was at times invited to Elizabeth's court, but spent most of her time with her grandmother. A BBC documentary<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/bbb-hardwick.shtml |title=BBC Documentary Site}}</ref> showed that Bess very much desired Arbella to become Queen, even imprisoning the young lady to prevent her from eloping. Arbella blamed her grandmother for this, and the two fell out irrevocably when Arbella attempted to run away and marry a man who, as a descendant of Henry VII, also had a claim to the throne. Bess cut Arbella from her will and begged the Queen to take her granddaughter off her hands. Arbella's royal claim was never recognized. Despite disinheriting Arbella and her eldest son (Henry: for aiding Arbella's escape); she later had a \"lukewarm reconciliation with her granddaughter.<ref name=\":1\" /> Bess has been an ancestor of the royal line since 1952; [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] being Bess's descendant through the Dukes of Portland, in whose family was Elizabeth II's maternal grandmother, [[Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck]].\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:Bess of Hardwick- Derby Cathedral.JPG|thumb|Effigy of Elizabeth Hardwick wearing a [[coronet]] of a [[Earl|countess]].

{"title_page": "Feminist performance art", "text_new": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\nAccording to scholar Virginia Mackenny, [[performance art]] is a great tool to mold and remold gender because performance art, in most instances, includes a direct subversion to everyday conventions. MacKenny also writes that feminist performance Art had a large presence \u201cin the late '60s and early '70s in America when, in the climate of protest constituted by the civil rights movement and [[second wave feminism]].\" There are several movements that fall under the category of feminist performance art, including Feminist Postmodernism, which took place during 1960-1970 and focused on the exploitation of women's bodies as a means for profit. Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n== Performance Artists ==\n\n===[[Soad Hosny]]===\n[[File:Suad Husni.jpg|thumb|Suad Husni in 1972 from her movie \"Khalli Balak Min Zoozoo\" (watch out for Zoozoo)]]\n[[Soad Hosny]] (January 26, 1943 \u2013 June 21, 2001)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elfagr.news/2442336|title=\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f.. \u0634\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f \u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a|website=\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062c\u0631|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> is an Egyptian actress and singer named the \"Cinderella of Egyptian Cinema\".<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://login.colorado.idm.oclc.org/login?qurl=https://bi.gale.com%2fglobal%2farticle%2fGALE%257CA569882059%3fu%3dcoloboulder%26sid%3dsummon|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=login.colorado.idm.oclc.org|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> In her 32 year long career, Hosny preformed in more than [[Soad Hosny filmography|83 films]] and a single TV series called \"Hekayat Hwa we Heya\".<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://https//elcinema.com/en/person/1097577|title=Soad Hosny - Actor Filmography\u060c photos\u060c Video|website=elCinema.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref name=\":03\" />\n\n==== Feminist works ====\n\n===== \"Lilregal Faqat\" =====\nIn 1964, she and [[Nadia Lutfi]] acted in the movie \"Lilregal Faqat\" (For Men Only), which discusses woman's ability to take on jobs that are stereotypically masculine.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allam|first=Nermin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pck-DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=feminist+film+%22+lel+regal+fakat%22&source=bl&ots=j-t04-XqFe&sig=ACfU3U34aedePx32Yscd_egNBCUbmDn4og&hl=ar&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4xZqBuOToAhVYnp4KHburC60Q6AEwAXoECAsQLQ#v=onepage&q=feminist%20film%20%22%20lel%20regal%20fakat%22&f=false|title=Women and the Egyptian Revolution: Engagement and Activism during the 2011 Arab Uprisings|date=2018|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-42190-4|language=en}}</ref> In the movie, Soad and Nadia play the roles of two lab workers who report oil-wills locations based on samples they get from the desert.

During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough. You take care of it afterwards.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> After Sean\u2019s birth, she ran the couple\u2019s business while Lennon stayed home as \u201chousehusband.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Ono\u2019s hands off approach to parenting is a source of controversy because she was simultaneously too motherly and not motherly enough.\n\n=== Work ===\nOne of her early works is [[Cut Piece]], first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto. She kneeled on the stage in her best suit and invited audience members to use scissors to cut it off of her. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.<ref>Munroe, Alexandra; Ono, Yoko; Hendricks, Jon; Altshuler, Bruce; Ross, David A.; Wenner, Jann S.; Concannon, Kevin C.; Tomii, Reiko; Sayle, Murray; Gomez, Edward M.

The book reads like an instruction manual for the reader to create their own versions of her pieces either physically or in the imagination. Over the nearly 60 years that she has been active, Ono has created installations of modern art across the globe, recorded numerous original songs both with John Lennon and the [[Plastic Ono Band]], as well as individually, and continues in activism to this day.\n\n== Orlan==\nORLAN (born as Mireille Suzanne Francette Porte) is French performance artist, most known for her radical use of plastic surgery to form her work. She uses her face and body as a malleable tool to change her appearance and therefore change her art. She primarily used plastic surgery to morph and change her body in her theatrical expression. Orlan uses her body at the heart of her expression, to articulate her political, social and cultural beliefs. Due to suffering an ectopic pregnancy, she felt her body was changed dramatically, and through that, she chose to turn her body into artwork through the use of plastic surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/orlan/|title=ORLAN {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of her most notable performances was that of the 1977 International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris.

Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n== Performance Artists ==\n\n===[[Soad Hosny]]===\n[[File:Suad Husni.jpg|thumb|Suad Husni in 1972 from her movie \"Khalli Balak Min Zoozoo\" (watch out for Zoozoo)]]\n[[Soad Hosny]] (January 26, 1943 \u2013 June 21, 2001)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elfagr.news/2442336|title=\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f.. \u0634\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062f \u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f \u062d\u0633\u0646\u064a|website=\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062c\u0631|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> is an Egyptian actress and singer named the \"Cinderella of Egyptian Cinema\".<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://login.colorado.idm.oclc.org/login?qurl=https://bi.gale.com%2fglobal%2farticle%2fGALE%257CA569882059%3fu%3dcoloboulder%26sid%3dsummon|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=login.colorado.idm.oclc.org|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> In her 32 year long career, Hosny preformed in more than [[Soad Hosny filmography|83 films]] and a single TV series called \"Hekayat Hwa we Heya\".<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://https//elcinema.com/en/person/1097577|title=Soad Hosny - Actor Filmography\u060c photos\u060c Video|website=elCinema.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref name=\":03\" />\n\n==== Feminist works ====\n\n===== \"Lilregal Faqat\" =====\nIn 1964, she and [[Nadia Lutfi]] acted in the movie \"Lilregal Faqat\" (For Men Only), which discusses woman's ability to take on jobs that are stereotypically masculine.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allam|first=Nermin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pck-DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=feminist+film+%22+lel+regal+fakat%22&source=bl&ots=j-t04-XqFe&sig=ACfU3U34aedePx32Yscd_egNBCUbmDn4og&hl=ar&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4xZqBuOToAhVYnp4KHburC60Q6AEwAXoECAsQLQ#v=onepage&q=feminist%20film%20%22%20lel%20regal%20fakat%22&f=false|title=Women and the Egyptian Revolution: Engagement and Activism during the 2011 Arab Uprisings|date=2018|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-42190-4|language=en}}</ref> In the movie, Soad and Nadia play the roles of two lab workers who report oil-wills locations based on samples they get from the desert.

In the early 1990s, Kahlo had become a recognized figure in art history, but also regarded as an icon for [[Chicano Movement|Chicana/os]], the [[Latinx]]<nowiki/>community, the [[feminism]]<nowiki/>movement, and the [[LGBTQ+]]<nowiki/>movement.

During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough.

The book reads like an instruction manual for the reader to create their own versions of her pieces either physically or in the imagination.

She uses her face and body as a malleable tool to change her appearance and therefore change her art. She primarily used plastic surgery to morph and change her body in her theatrical expression. Orlan uses her body at the heart of her expression, to articulate her political, social and cultural beliefs. Due to suffering an ectopic pregnancy, she felt her body was changed dramatically, and through that, she chose to turn her body into artwork through the use of plastic surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/orlan/|title=ORLAN {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of her most notable performances was that of the 1977 International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris.

The most notable example is the song \u2018Thunderbolt\u2019  which allows listeners to draw \"Tesla coil charges which alter the bass lines you hear\" and when she performs the song live she has twin Tesla coils to play the bass line.<ref name=\":2\" /> This album however was more than a challenge for Bj\u00f6rk to create a new sound, she created the album as a response to the environmental issues Iceland was facing in 2008. Iceland had allowed the aluminum smelters to take over the countries fishing industry while being the cause for excessive greenhouse gas emissions.

A fierce opponent of slavery and discrimination against  [[African-Americans]], Stevens sought to secure their rights during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], in opposition to U.S. President [[Andrew Johnson]]. As chairman of the [[House Ways and Means Committee]] during the [[American Civil War]], he played a leading role, focusing his attention on defeating the Confederacy, financing the war with new taxes and borrowing, crushing the power of slave owners, ending slavery, and securing equal rights for the Freedmen.\n\nStevens was born in rural Vermont, in poverty, and with a [[club foot]], which left him with a permanent [[limp]].  He moved to Pennsylvania as a young man and quickly became a successful lawyer in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]].  He interested himself in municipal affairs, and then in politics. He was elected to the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]], where he became a strong advocate of free public education. Financial setbacks in 1842 caused him to move his home and practice to the larger city of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].  There, he joined the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], and was elected to Congress in 1848. His activities as a lawyer and politician in opposition to slavery cost him votes and he did not seek reelection in 1852.  After a brief flirtation with the [[Know-Nothing Party]], Stevens joined the newly formed Republican Party, and was elected to Congress again in 1858.  There, with fellow radicals such as Massachusetts Senator [[Charles Sumner]], he opposed the expansion of slavery and concessions to the South as the war came. \n\nStevens argued that slavery should not survive the war; he was frustrated by the slowness of U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to support his position.  He guided the government's financial legislation through the House as Ways and Means chairman.  As the war progressed towards a Northern victory, Stevens came to believe that not only should slavery be abolished, but that African-Americans should be given a stake in the South's future through the confiscation of land from planters to be distributed to the freedmen (see [[40 acres and a mule]]). His plans went too far for the Moderate Republicans and were not enacted.\n\nAfter the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]] in April 1865, Stevens came into conflict with the new president, Johnson, who sought rapid restoration of the seceded states without guarantees for freedmen. The difference in views caused an ongoing battle between Johnson and Congress, with Stevens leading the Radical Republicans. After gains in the 1866 election the radicals took control of Reconstruction away from Johnson. Stevens's last great battle was to secure in the House [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|articles of impeachment against Johnson]], though the Senate did not convict the President.  [[Historiography|Historiographical]] views of Stevens have dramatically shifted over the years, from the early 20th-century view of Stevens as reckless and motivated by hatred of the white South, to the perspective of the [[neoabolitionist]]s of the 1950s and afterwards, who applauded him for his [[Egalitarianism|commitment to equality]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nStevens was born in [[Danville, Vermont]], on April 4, 1792.  He was the second of four children, all boys, and was named to honor the [[Poland|Polish]] general who served in the American Revolution, [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko|Thaddeus Ko\u015bciuszko]]. His parents were Baptists who had emigrated from Massachusetts around 1786.  Thaddeus was born with a [[club foot]] which, at the time, was seen as a judgment from God for secret parental sin.  His older brother was born with the same condition in both feet.  The boys' father, Joshua Stevens, was a farmer and cobbler who struggled to make a living in Vermont. After fathering two more sons (born without disability) Joshua abandoned the children and his wife Sarah (n\u00e9e Morrill).  The circumstances of his departure and his subsequent fate are uncertain; he may have died at the [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1814)|Battle of Oswego]] during the [[War of 1812]].<ref>Trefousse, pp. 1\u20132</ref>\n\nSarah Stevens struggled to make a living from the farm, with the increasing aid of her sons.<ref>Meltzer, pp. 3\u20134</ref> She was determined that her sons improve themselves, and in 1807 moved the family to the neighboring town of [[Peacham, Vermont]], where she enrolled young Thaddeus in the Caledonia Grammar School (often called the Peacham Academy). He suffered much from the taunts of his classmates for his disability.  Later accounts describe him there as \"wilful, headstrong\" with \"an overwhelming burning desire to secure an education.\"<ref>Brodie, pp. 26\u201327</ref>\n\nAfter graduation, he enrolled at the [[University of Vermont]] but suspended his studies due to the federal government's appropriation of campus buildings during the [[War of 1812]].<ref>History of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, with Biographical Sketches of Many of its Pioneers and Prominent Men; Chapter XXI. The Bench and Bar of Lancaster County</ref> Stevens then enrolled in the [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] class at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]].  At Dartmouth, despite a stellar academic career, he was not elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]; this was reportedly a scarring experience for him.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 4\u20135</ref><ref>Brodie, pp. 27\u201329</ref>\n\nStevens graduated from Dartmouth in 1814, and was chosen as a speaker at the [[commencement ceremony]].  Afterwards, he returned to Peacham and briefly taught there.  Stevens also began to [[reading law|study law]] with [[John Mattocks]].  In early 1815, correspondence with friend [[Samuel Merrill (Indiana)|Samuel Merrill]], a fellow Vermonter who had moved to [[York, Pennsylvania]] to become preceptor of the [[York College of Pennsylvania|York Academy]], led to an offer for Stevens to join the academy faculty. He moved to York to teach, and continued the study of law in the offices of David Cossett.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 5\u20137</ref>\n\n==Pennsylvania attorney and politician==\n\n===Gettysburg lawyer===\nIn Pennsylvania, Stevens taught school at the [[York College of Pennsylvania|York Academy]] and continued his studies for the bar.<ref name = \"t11\" />  Local lawyers passed a resolution barring from membership anyone who had \"followed any other profession while preparing for admission,\"<ref>History of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, with Biographical Sketches of Many of its Pioneers and Prominent Men:\nChapter XXI. The Bench and Bar of Lancaster County</ref> a restriction likely aimed at Stevens. Undaunted, he reportedly (according to a story he often retold) presented himself and four bottles of [[Madeira wine]] to the examining board in nearby [[Harford County, Maryland]], and few questions were asked but much wine drunk. He left [[Bel Air, Maryland|Bel Air]] the next morning with a certificate allowing him, through [[Admission on motion|reciprocity]], to practice law anywhere.  Stevens then went to [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], the seat of [[Adams County, Pennsylvania|Adams County]],<ref name = \"t11\">Trefousse, p. 11</ref><ref>Meltzer, p. 14</ref> where he opened an office in September 1816.<ref name = \"b32\">Brodie, p. 32</ref>\n\nStevens knew no one in Gettysburg and initially had little success as a lawyer.  His breakthrough, in mid-1817, was a case in which a farmer who had been jailed for debt later killed one of the [[constable]]s who had arrested him.  His defense, although unsuccessful, impressed the local people and he never lacked for business thereafter.<ref name = \"b32\" /> In his legal career, he demonstrated the propensity for sarcasm that would later mark him as a politician, once telling a judge who accused him of manifesting [[contempt of court]], \"Sir, I am doing my best to conceal it.\"<ref>Metzger, p. 17</ref>\n\nMany who memorialized Stevens after his death in 1868 agreed on his talent as a lawyer. He was involved in the first ten cases to reach the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]] from Adams County after he began practice, and won nine. One case he later wished he had not won was ''Butler v. Delaplaine'', in which he successfully reclaimed a slave on behalf of her owner.<ref name = \"profits\">Trefouse, pp. 13\u201316</ref>\n\nIn Gettysburg, Stevens also began his involvement in politics, serving six one-year terms on the [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] council between 1822 and 1831 and becoming its president.<ref>Glatfelter, p. 163</ref> He took the profits from his practice and invested them in Gettysburg real estate, becoming the largest landowner in the community by 1825, and had an interest in several [[iron furnace]]s outside town.<ref name = \"profits\" /> In addition to assets, he acquired enemies; after the death of a pregnant black woman in Gettysburg, there were anonymous letter-writers to newspapers, hinting that Stevens was culpable.  The rumors dogged him for years;<ref>Trefousse, pp. 21\u201322</ref> when one newspaper opposed to Stevens printed a letter in 1831 naming him as the killer, he successfully sued for libel.<ref>Brodie, pp. 42\u201345</ref>\n\n===Anti-Masonry===\nStevens's first political cause was [[Anti-Masonry]], which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance and death of [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|William Morgan]], a [[Freemasonry|Mason]] in [[Upstate New York]]; fellow Masons were presumed to be the killers of Morgan because they disapproved of his publishing a book revealing the order's secret rites. Since the leading candidate in opposition to President [[John Quincy Adams]] was General [[Andrew Jackson]], a Mason who mocked opponents of the order, Anti-Masonry became closely associated with opposition to Jackson, and to his [[Jacksonian democracy]] policies once he was elected president in 1828.<ref>Brodie, pp. 38\u201339</ref>\n\nJackson's adherents were from the old [[Democratic-Republican Party]] and eventually became known as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Stevens had been told by fellow attorney (and future president) [[James Buchanan]] that he could advance politically if he joined them, but Stevens could not support Jackson, out of principle.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 17, 19</ref> For Stevens, Anti-Masonry became one means of opposing Jackson; he may also have had personal reasons as the Masons barred \"cripples\" from joining. Stevens took to Anti-Masonry with enthusiasm, and remained loyal to it after most Pennsylvanians had dropped the cause. His biographer, Hans Trefousse, suggested that another reason for Stevens's virulence was an attack of disease in the late 1820s that cost him his hair (he thereafter wore wigs, often ill-fitting), and \"the unwelcome illness may well have contributed to his unreasonable fanaticism concerning the Masons.\"<ref>Trefousse, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nBy 1829, Anti-Masonry had evolved into a political party, the [[Anti-Masonic Party]], that proved popular in rural central Pennsylvania. Stevens quickly became prominent in the movement, attending the party's first two national conventions in 1830 and 1831.  At the latter, he pressed the candidacy of Supreme Court Justice [[John McLean]] as the party's presidential candidate, but in vain as the nomination fell to former Attorney General [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]]. Jackson was easily reelected; the crushing defeat (Wirt won only Vermont) caused the party to disappear in most places, though it remained powerful in Pennsylvania for several years.<ref>Metzger, pp. 27\u201329</ref><ref>Trefousse, pp. 26\u201331</ref>\n\nIn September 1833, Stevens was elected to a one-year term in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as an Anti-Mason, and once in the capital [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] sought to have the body establish a committee to investigate Masonry. Stevens gained attention far beyond Pennsylvania for his oratory against Masonry, and also quickly became expert in legislative maneuvers. In 1835, a split among the Democrats put the Anti-Masons in control of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]], the legislature. Granted subpoena powers, Stevens summoned leading state politicians who were Masons, including Governor [[George Wolf]]. The witnesses [[Taking the Fifth|invoked their Fifth Amendment right]] against self-incrimination, and when Stevens verbally abused one of them, it created a backlash that caused his own party to end the investigation. The fracas cost Stevens reelection in 1836, and the issue of Anti-Masonry died in Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, Stevens remained an opponent of the order for the rest of his life.<ref>Brodie, pp. 57\u201359</ref><ref>Trefousse, pp. 33\u201337, 42\u201343</ref>\n\n===Crusader for education===\nBeginning with his early years in Gettysburg, Stevens advanced the cause of universal education.  At the time, no state outside New England had free public education for all. In Pennsylvania, there was free education in [[Philadelphia]], but elsewhere in the state, those wishing to have their children educated without paying tuition had to swear a [[pauper's oath]]. Stevens opened his extensive private library to the public and gave up his presidency of the borough council, believing his service on the [[school board]] more important.<ref>Metzger, pp. 31\u201332</ref> In 1825, he was elected by the voters of Adams County as a trustee of Gettysburg Academy.  As the school was failing, Stevens got [[county (United States)|county]] voters to agree to pay its debt, allowing it to be sold as a Lutheran seminary.  It was granted the right to award college degrees in 1831 as Pennsylvania College, and in 1921 became [[Gettysburg College]]. Stevens gave the school land upon which a building could be raised and for many years served as a trustee.<ref>Brodie, p. 59</ref><ref>Glatfelter, pp. 164\u2013166</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=College History|url=http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/college_history/|publisher=Gettysburg College|accessdate=July 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718173606/http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/college_history/|archive-date=2013-07-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File: Stevens Gettysburg portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Stevens by [[Jacob Eichholtz]] now owned by Gettysburg College]]\nIn April 1834, Stevens, working with Governor Wolf, guided through the legislature an act to allow districts across the state to vote on whether to have public schools and the taxes to pay for them. Gettysburg's district voted in favor and also elected Stevens as a school director, where he served until 1839.  Tens of thousands of voters signed petitions urging a reversal.  The result was a repeal bill that easily passed the [[Pennsylvania Senate]]. It was widely believed the bill would also pass the House, and be enacted despite opposition by Stevens.  When he rose to speak on April 11, 1835, he defended the new educational system, stating that it would actually save money, and demonstrated how.  He stated opponents were seeking to separate the poor into a lower caste than themselves, and accused the rich of greed and failure to empathize with the poor. Stevens argued, \"Build not your monuments of brass or marble, but make them of everliving mind!\"<ref>Brodie, pp. 60\u201361</ref><ref>Trefousse, pp. 39\u201340</ref> The repeal bill was defeated; Stevens was given wide credit.  Trefousse suggested that the victory was not due to Stevens's eloquence, but due to his influence, combined with that of Governor Wolf.<ref>Trefousse, p. 40</ref>\n\n===Political change; move to Lancaster===\nIn 1838, Stevens ran again for the legislature.  He hoped that if the remaining Anti-Masons and the emerging Whig Party gained a majority, he could be elected to the [[United States Senate]], whose members until 1913 were chosen by state legislatures.  A campaign, dirty even by the standards of the times, followed. The result was a Democrat elected as governor, Whig control of the state Senate, and the state House in dispute, with a number of seats from Philadelphia in question, though Stevens won his seat in Adams County.  Stevens sought to have those Philadelphia Democrats excluded, which would create a Whig majority that could elect a Speaker and himself as senator.  Amid rioting in Harrisburg\u2014later known as the \"[[Buckshot War]]\"\u2014Stevens's ploy backfired, with the Democrats taking control of the House.  Stevens remained in the legislature most years through 1842, but the episode cost him much of his political influence, as the Whigs blamed him for the debacle and were increasingly unwilling to give leadership to someone who had not yet joined their party. Nevertheless, he supported the pro-business and pro-development Whig stances.<ref name=\"Brodie-p75-84\">Brodie, pp. 75\u201384</ref> He campaigned for the Whig candidate in the 1840 presidential election, former general  [[William Henry Harrison]].  Though Stevens later alleged that Harrison had promised him a Cabinet position if elected, he received none, and any influence ended when Harrison died after a month in office, to be succeeded by [[John Tyler]], a southerner hostile to Stevens's stances on slavery.<ref name=\"Brodie-p75-84\" /><ref>Trefousse, pp. 57\u201367</ref>\n\nAlthough Stevens was the most successful lawyer in Gettysburg, he had accrued debt due to his business interests. Refusing to take advantage of the bankruptcy laws, he felt he needed to move to a larger municipality in order to gain the money to pay his obligations.  In 1842, Stevens moved his home and practice to the city of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]].  He knew [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]] was an Anti-Mason and Whig stronghold, which ensured that he retained a political base. Within a short period, he was earning more than any other Lancaster attorney; by 1848 he had reduced his debts to $30,000 and paid them off soon after. It was in Lancaster that he engaged the services of [[Lydia Hamilton Smith]], a housekeeper, whose racial makeup was described as [[mulatto]], and who remained with him the rest of his life.<!-- please do not add anything about Mrs. Smith here, the question of her relationship with him is discussed below --><ref>Trefousse, pp. 68\u201369</ref>\n\n==Abolitionist and prewar congressman==\n\n===Evolution of views===\nIn the 1830s, few sought the immediate eradication of slavery.  The [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] was young and only recently had figures such as [[William Lloyd Garrison]] taken on the fight.<ref name=\"Brodie, pp. 105\u2013106\">Brodie, pp. 105\u2013106</ref> Stevens's reason for adopting slavery as a cause has been disputed among his recent biographers. Richard Current, in 1942, suggested it was out of ambition; [[Fawn Brodie]], in her controversial 1959 psychobiography of Stevens, suggested it was out of identification with the downtrodden, based on his handicap.<ref>Berlin, pp. 155\u2013158</ref> Trefousse, in his 1997 work, also suggested that Stevens's feelings towards the downtrodden were a factor, combined with remorse over the ''Butler'' case, but that ambition was unlikely to have been a major motivator, as Stevens's fervor in the anti-slavery cause inhibited his career.<ref>Trefousse, p. 46</ref>\n\n[[File:Thaddeus Stevens House.JPG|thumb|upright|Stevens's home on Queen Street, Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]\nAt the [[1837 Pennsylvania constitutional convention]], Stevens, who was a delegate, fought against the [[disenfranchisement]] of African-Americans (see [[Black suffrage in Pennsylvania]]). <ref>Meltzer, pp. 52\u201353</ref>  According to historian [[Eric Foner]], \"When Stevens refused to sign the 1837 constitution because of its voting provision, he announced his commitment to a non-racial definition of American citizenship to which he would adhere for the remainder of his life\".<ref name=\"Foner-p143\">Foner, p. 143</ref> After he moved to Lancaster, a city not far from the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]], he became active in the [[Underground Railroad]], not only defending people believed to be fugitive slaves, but coordinating the movements of those seeking freedom.<ref>Trefousse, p. 73</ref>  A 2003 renovation at his former home in Lancaster disclosed that there was a hidden cistern, attached to the main building by a concealed tunnel, in which escaped slaves hid.<ref name = \"Carlson\">{{cite web|last=Carlson|first=Peter|title=Thaddeus Stevens|publisher =Weder History Group|url=http://www.historynet.com/thaddeus-stevens.htm|date=February 19, 2013|accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=James A.|last=Delle|first2=Mary Ann|last2=Levine|url=http://digitalcommons.buffalostate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1094&context=neha|title=Excavations at the Thaddeus Stevens and Lydia Hamilton Smith Site, Lancaster, Pennsylvania: Archaeological Evidence for the Underground Railroad|journal=Northeast Historical Archaeology|volume=33|issue=1|publisher=State University of New York College at Buffalo|location=Buffalo, N.Y.|accessdate=July 15, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325173644/http://digitalcommons.buffalostate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1094&context=neha|archivedate=March 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nStevens, until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], took the public position that he supported slavery's end and opposed its expansion.

There was opposition to him at the Whig convention.  Some delegates felt that because Stevens had been late to join the party, he should not receive the nomination; others disliked his stance on slavery.  He narrowly won the nomination.  In a strong year for Whigs nationally, Taylor was chosen as president and Stevens was elected to Congress.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 76\u201377</ref>\n\n{{quote box | align = right | width = 27em | salign = right\n| quote =  It is my purpose nowhere in these remarks to make personal reproaches; I entertain no ill-will toward any human being, nor any brute, that I know of, not even the [Democratic] skunk across the way to which I referred.

Thaddeus Stevens Society.  Retrieved on June 17, 2013.</ref>}}\n\nWhen the [[31st United States Congress]] convened in December 1849, Stevens took his seat, joining other newly elected slavery opponents such as [[Salmon P. Chase]]. Stevens spoke out against the [[Compromise of 1850]], crafted by Kentucky Senator [[Henry Clay]], that gave victories to both North and South, but would allow for some of the [[territories of the United States]] recently gained from Mexico to become slave states.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 79\u201380</ref> In June, as the debates continued, he stated, \"This word 'compromise' when applied to human rights and constitutional rights I abhor\".<ref>Trefousse, p. 81</ref> Nevertheless, the pieces of legislation that made up the Compromise passed, including the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], which Stevens found particularly offensive.<ref>Meltzer, p. 94</ref> Although many Americans hoped that the Compromise would bring sectional peace, Stevens warned that it would be \"the fruitful mother of future rebellion, disunion, and civil war\".<ref>Brodie, p. 114</ref>\n\nStevens was easily renominated and reelected in 1850, even though his stance caused him problems among pro-Compromise Whigs.<ref name=\"Brodie, pp. 116\u2013119\">Brodie, pp. 116\u2013119</ref> In 1851, Stevens was one of the defense lawyers in the trial of 38 African-Americans and three others in federal court in Philadelphia on treason charges.  The defendants had been implicated in the so-called [[Christiana Riot]], in which an attempt to enforce a Fugitive Slave Act warrant had resulted in the killing of the slaveowner. Justice [[Robert Cooper Grier|Robert Grier]] of the U.S. Supreme Court, as [[circuit justice]], tried the case, and [[Directed verdict|instructed the jury to acquit]] on the grounds that though the defendants might be guilty of murder or riot, they were not charged with that, and were not guilty of treason.  The well-publicized incident (and others like it) increased polarization over the issue of slavery and made Stevens a prominent face of Northern abolitionism.<ref name=\"Brodie, pp. 116\u2013119\"/><ref name=Bond305>Bond, p. 305.</ref>\n\nDespite this trend, Stevens suffered political problems.  He left the Whig caucus in December 1851, when his colleagues would not join him in seeking the repeal of the offensive elements of the Compromise, though he supported its unsuccessful 1852 candidate for president, General [[Winfield Scott]]. His political opposition, and local dislike of his stance on slavery and participation in the treason trial, made him unlikely to win renomination, and he sought only to pick his successor.  His choice was defeated for the Whig nomination.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\n===Know-Nothing and Republican===\nOut of office, Stevens concentrated on the practice of law in Lancaster, remaining one of the leading attorneys in the state.  He stayed active in politics, and in 1854, to gain more votes for the anti-slavery movement, he joined the nativist [[Know Nothing Party]].  The members were pledged not to speak of party deliberations (thus, they knew nothing), and Stevens was attacked for his membership in a group with similar rules of secrecy as the Masons. In 1855, Stevens joined the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].  Other former Whigs who were anti-slavery joined as well, including [[William H. Seward]] of New York, [[Charles E. Sumner]] of Massachusetts, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] of Illinois.<ref>Brodie, pp. 121\u2013123</ref>\n\nStevens was a delegate to the [[1856 Republican National Convention]], where he supported Justice McLean, as he had in 1832.  The convention, however, nominated [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], whom Stevens actively supported in the race against his fellow Lancastrian, the Democratic candidate James Buchanan.  Nonetheless, Pennsylvania helped elect Buchanan.<ref>Brodie, pp. 129\u2013130</ref> Stevens returned to the practice of law, but in 1858, with the President and his party unpopular and the nation torn by such controversies as the [[Dred Scott decision]], Stevens saw an opportunity to return to Congress. As the Republican nominee, he was easily elected.  Democratic papers were appalled.  One banner headline read, \"Niggerism Triumphant\".<ref>Trefousse, pp. 95\u201397</ref>\n\n===1860 election; secession crisis===\nStevens took his seat in the [[36th United States Congress]] in December 1859, only days after the hanging of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], who had attacked the federal arsenal at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] hoping to cause a slave insurrection.  Stevens opposed Brown's violent actions at the time, though later, he was more approving. Sectional tensions spilled over into the House, which proved unable to elect a [[Speaker of the United States House]] for eight weeks.  Stevens was active in the bitter flow of invective from both sides; at one point, Mississippi Congressman [[William Barksdale]] drew a knife on him, though no blood was spilled.<ref>Brodie, pp. 130\u2013132</ref>\n\n[[File: Thaddeus as doctor.jpg|thumb|right|Southern view of the proposed compromises of 1860 and 1861, with \"Dr. North\" (Stevens) proposing to cut the South's legs off by means of constitutional amendment.  Stevens actually opposed such measures.]]\nWith the Democrats unable to agree on a single presidential candidate, the [[1860 Republican National Convention]] in Chicago became crucial, as the nominee would be in a favorable position to become president. Prominent figures in the party such as Seward and Lincoln sought the nomination.  Stevens continued to support the 75-year-old Justice McLean. Beginning on the second ballot, most Pennsylvania delegates supported Lincoln, helping to win the Illinoisan the nomination. As the Democrats put up no candidate in his district, Stevens was assured of reelection to the House and campaigned for Lincoln in Pennsylvania. Lincoln won a majority in the Electoral College.  The [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect's]] known opposition to the expansion of slavery caused immediate talk of secession in the southern states, a threat that Stevens had downplayed during the campaign.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 100\u2013103</ref><ref>Brodie, p. 133</ref>\n\nCongress convened in December 1860, with several of the southern states already pledging to secede.  Stevens was unyielding in opposing efforts to appease the southerners, such as the [[Crittenden Compromise]], which would have enshrined slavery as beyond constitutional amendment.<ref>Metzger, pp. 119\u2013121</ref> He stated, in a remark widely quoted both North and South, that rather than offer concessions because of Lincoln's election, he would see \"this Government crumble into a thousand atoms\", and that the forces of the United States would crush any rebellion.<ref>Trefousse, p. 107</ref> Despite Stevens's protests, the [[lame duck (politics)|lame-duck]] Buchanan administration did little in response to the secession votes, allowing most federal resources in the South to fall into rebel hands. Many, even in the abolition movement, were content to let it be so and to let the South go its own way.  Stevens did not agree, and the congressman was \"undoubtedly pleased\"  by Lincoln's statement in [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|his first inaugural address]] on March 4, 1861, that he would \"hold, occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the Government\".<ref>Trefousse, p. 109</ref><ref>Brodie, p. 139</ref>\n\n==American Civil War==\n\n===Slavery===\nWhen the war began in April 1861, Stevens argued that the Confederates were revolutionaries, to be crushed by force. He also believed that the Confederacy had placed itself beyond the protection of the U.S. Constitution by making war, and in a reconstituted United States, slavery would have no place. Speaker [[Galusha Grow]], whose views placed him with Stevens among the members becoming known as the [[Radical Republicans]] (for their position on slavery, as opposed to the Conservative or [[Moderate Republicans]]), appointed him as chairman of the [[House Ways and Means Committee]]. This position gave him power over the House's agenda.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 109\u2013114</ref>\n\n{{quote box | align = right | width = 23em | salign = right| quote = Abolition\u2014Yes! abolish everything on the face of the earth but this Union; free every slave\u2014slay every traitor\u2014burn every rebel mansion, if these things are necessary to preserve this temple of freedom to the world and to our posterity.\n| source =\u2014Stevens accepting renomination for his congressional seat, September 1, 1862<ref>{{cite book|author=Thaddeus Stevens|title=The Selected Papers of Thaddeus Stevens: January 1814-March 1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0Fs655TKfsC&pg=PA322|year=1997|location=Pittsburgh, Pa.|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|page=322|isbn=9780822970453}}</ref>}}\n\nIn July 1861, Stevens secured the passage of [[First Confiscation Act|an act]] to confiscate the property, including slaves, of certain rebels.

Stevens, who had been there supervising operations, was hastened away by his workers against his will. General [[Jubal Early]] looted and vandalized the Forge, causing a loss to Stevens of about $80,000. Early said that the North had done the same to southern figures, and that Stevens was well known for his vindictiveness towards the South.<ref>Trefousse, p. 134</ref> Asked if he would have taken the congressman to [[Libby Prison]] in Richmond, Early replied that he would have hanged Stevens and divided his bones among the Confederate states.<ref>Brodie, p. 180</ref>\n\nStevens pushed Congress to pass a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery.

Illinois Representative [[Isaac Arnold]] wrote: \"distinguished soldiers and citizens filled every available seat, to hear the eloquent old man speak on a measure that was to consummate the warfare of forty years against slavery\".<ref>Brodie, p. 203</ref>\n\nThe amendment passed narrowly after heavy pressure exerted by Lincoln himself, along with offers of political appointments from the \"[[William Bilbo|Seward lobby]]\".

Lippincott Company|location=Philadelphia}}</ref>  The amendment was declared ratified on December 18, 1865. Stevens continued to push for a broad interpretation of it that included economic justice in addition to the formal end of slavery.<ref>Tsesis, pp. 41\u201343.</ref><ref>Brodie, p. 204</ref>\n\nAfter passing the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress debated the economic rights of the freedmen. Urged on by Stevens,<ref name=Bond305 /> it voted to authorize the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands]], with a mandate (though no funding) to set up schools and to distribute \"not more than forty acres\" [16 ha] of confiscated Confederate land to each family of freed slaves.<ref>Bond, p. 304</ref>\n\n===Financing the war===\n\nStevens worked closely with Lincoln administration officials on legislation to finance the war. Within a day of his appointment as Ways and Means chairman, he had reported a bill for a war loan. Legislation to pay the soldiers Lincoln had already called into service and to allow the administration to borrow to prosecute the war quickly followed. These acts and more were pushed through the House by Stevens.  To defeat the delaying tactics of [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperhead]] opponents, he had the House set debate limits as short as half a minute.<ref>Brodie, pp. 150\u2013151</ref>\n\nStevens played a major part in the passage of the [[Legal Tender Cases|Legal Tender Act of 1862]], when for the first time the United States issued currency backed only by its own credit, not by gold or silver. Early makeshifts to finance the war, such as war bonds, had failed as it became clear the war would not be short.<ref>Smock, pp. 193\u2013194</ref> In 1863, Stevens aided the passage of the [[National Banking Act]], that required that banks limit their currency issues to the number of federal bonds that they were required to hold. The system endured for a half-century until supplanted by the [[Federal Reserve System]] in 1913.<ref>Trefousse, p. 131</ref>\n\nAlthough the Legal Tender legislation allowed for the payment of government obligations in paper money, Stevens was unable to get the Senate to agree that interest on the national debt should be paid with [[greenback (money)|greenbacks]].<ref>Brodie, pp. 174\u2013175</ref>  As the value of paper money dropped, Stevens railed against gold speculators, and in June 1864 after consultation with Treasury Secretary [[Salmon P. Chase]], proposed what became known as the Gold Bill\u2014to abolish the gold market by forbidding its sale by brokers or for future delivery. It passed Congress in June; the chaos caused by the lack of an organized gold market caused the value of paper to drop even faster.  Under heavy pressure from the business community, Congress repealed the bill on July 1, twelve days after its passage.<ref>Brodie, pp. 174\u2013177</ref> Stevens was unrepentant even as the value of paper currency recovered in late 1864 amid the expectation of Union victory, proposing legislation to make paying a premium in greenbacks for an amount in gold coin a criminal offense.  It did not pass.<ref>Brodie, p. 178</ref>\n\nStevens, like most Pennsylvania politicians of both parties, was a major proponent of tariffs, which increased from 19% to 48% from fiscal 1861 to fiscal 1865.<ref>Census Bureau, \"Historical Statistics of the United States from Colonial Times to 1970, Part 2, 888</ref><ref>Steve Moyer \"Remarkable Radical: Thaddeus Stevens *Humanities Magazine V.33, N.6 (December 2012)</ref> According to activist [[Ida Tarbell]] in \"The Tariff in Our Times:\" [Import] duties were never too high for [Stevens], particularly for iron, for he was a manufacturer and it was often said in Pennsylvania that the duties he advocated in no way represented the large iron interests of the state, but were hoisted to cover the needs of his own ... badly managed works.\"<ref>Ida Tarbell \"The Tariff in Our Times (New York: Macmillan, 1911), 15</ref>\n\n==Reconstruction==\n{{main|Reconstruction Era}}\n\n===Problem of reconstructing the South===\nAs Congress debated how the U.S. would be organized after the war, the status of freed slaves and former Confederates remained undetermined.<ref>Stewart, pp. 17\u201318</ref><ref name = \"BJ148\">Bryant-Jones, p. 148</ref> Stevens stated that what was needed was a \"radical reorganization of southern institutions, habits, and manners\".<ref>Stewart, p. 17</ref> Stevens, Sumner and other radicals argued that the southern states should be treated like conquered provinces, without constitutional rights. Lincoln, on the contrary, said that only individuals, not states, had rebelled.<ref>Bryant-Jones, pp. 148\u2013149</ref> In July 1864, Stevens pushed Lincoln to sign the [[Wade\u2013Davis Bill]], which required at least half of prewar voters to sign an oath of loyalty for a state to gain readmission. Lincoln, who advocated his more lenient [[ten percent plan]], [[pocket veto]]ed it.<ref>Donald 1995, p. 510</ref>\n\nStevens reluctantly voted for Lincoln at the convention of the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]], a coalition of Republicans and [[War Democrat]]s. He would have preferred to vote for the sitting vice president, [[Hannibal Hamlin]], as Lincoln's running mate in 1864, but his delegation voted to cast the state's ballots for the administration's favored candidate, Military Governor of Tennessee [[Andrew Johnson]], a War Democrat who had been a Tennessee senator and elected governor.  Stevens was disgusted at Johnson's nomination, complaining, \"can't you get a candidate for Vice-President without going down into a damned rebel province for one?\"<ref>Trefousse, pp.  144\u2013147</ref> Stevens campaigned for the Lincoln-Johnson ticket; it was elected, as was Stevens for another term in the House.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 148\u2013149</ref> When in January 1865 Congress learned that Lincoln had attempted [[Hampton Roads Conference|peace talks with Confederate leaders]], an outraged Stevens declared that if the American electorate could vote again, they would elect General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] instead of Lincoln.<ref>William C. Harris, \"[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0021.104?rgn=main;view=fulltext#link_note_20 The Hampton Roads Peace Conference: A Final Test of Lincoln's Presidential Leadership]\", ''Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association'' 21(1), Winter 2000. Retrieved on June 30, 2013.</ref>\n\n===Presidential Reconstruction===\nBefore leaving town after Congress adjourned in March 1865, Stevens privately urged Lincoln to press the South hard militarily, though the war was ending.  Lincoln replied, \"Stevens, this is a pretty big hog we are trying to catch and to hold when we catch him.  We must take care that he does not slip away from us.\"<ref>Trefousse, p. 157</ref> Never to see Lincoln again, Stevens left with \"a homely metaphor but no real certainty of having left as much as a thumbprint on Lincoln's policy.\"<ref>Brodie, p. 216</ref> On the evening of April 14, 1865, Lincoln [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]].  Stevens did not attend the ceremonies when Lincoln's funeral train stopped in Lancaster; he was said to be ill. Trefousse speculated he may avoided the rites for other reasons.  According to Lincoln biographer [[Carl Sandburg]], Stevens stood at a railroad bridge and lifted his hat.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nIn May 1865, Andrew Johnson began what came to be known as \"[[Presidential Reconstruction]]\": recognizing a provisional government of Virginia led by [[Francis Harrison Pierpont]], calling for other former rebel states to organize constitutional conventions, declaring amnesty for many southerners, and issuing individual pardons to even more. Johnson did not push the states to protect the rights of freed slaves, and immediately began to counteract the land reform policies of the Freedmen's Bureau. These actions outraged Stevens and others who took his view. The radicals saw that freedmen in the South risked losing the economic and political liberty necessary to sustain emancipation from slavery. They began to call for [[universal manhood suffrage|universal male suffrage]] and continued their demands for land reform.<ref>Meltzer, pp. 165\u2013167</ref><ref>Trefousse, pp. 163\u2013164</ref>\n\nStevens wrote to Johnson that his policies were gravely damaging the country and that he should call a special session of Congress, which was not scheduled to meet until December. When his communications were ignored, Stevens began to discuss with other radicals how to prevail over Johnson when the two houses convened.  Congress has the constitutional power to be the judge of whether those seeking to be its members are properly elected; Stevens urged that no senators or representatives from the South be seated.<ref name = \"brodieparts\">Brodie, pp. 225\u2013230, 234\u2013239</ref> He argued that the states should not be readmitted as thereafter Congress would lack the power to force race reform.<ref>Brodie, p. 231</ref>\n\nIn September, Stevens gave a widely reprinted speech in Lancaster in which he set forth what he wanted for the South.  He proposed that the government confiscate the estates of the largest 70,000 landholders there, those who owned more than {{convert|200|acres}}.  Much of this property he wanted [[40 acres and a mule|distributed in plots of {{convert|40|acre}}]] to the freedmen; other lands would go to reward loyalists in both North and South, or to meet government obligations. He warned that under the President's plan, the southern states would send rebels to Congress who would join with northern Democrats and Johnson to govern the nation and perhaps undo emancipation.<ref>Brodie, pp. 231\u2013233</ref>\n\nThrough late 1865, the southern states held white-only balloting and in congressional elections, chose many former rebels, most prominently Confederate Vice President [[Alexander Stephens]], voted as senator by the [[Georgia Legislature]]. Violence against African-Americans was common and unpunished in the South; the new legislatures enacted [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], depriving the freedmen of most civil rights. These actions, seen as provocative in the North, both privately dismayed Johnson and helped turn northern public opinion against the president.<ref name = \"brodieparts\" /> Stevens proclaimed that \"This is not a 'white man's Government!' ....To say so is political blasphemy, for it violates the fundamental principles of our gospel of liberty.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Trefousse|title=Thaddeus Stevens|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUPqCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA177|page=177|isbn=9780807864999|date=2000-11-09}}</ref>\n\n===Congressional Reconstruction===\n[[File:Thaddeus Stevens2.jpg|thumb|right|Stevens in a thoughtful pose]]\nBy this time, Stevens was in his seventies and in poor health; he was carried everywhere in a special chair. When Congress convened in early December 1865, Stevens made arrangements with the [[Clerk of the House of Representatives|Clerk of the House]] that when the roll was called, the names of the Southern electees be omitted. The Senate also excluded Southern claimants. A new congressman, Ohio's [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], described Stevens: \"He is radical throughout, except, I am told, he don't believe in hanging.  He is leader.\"<ref>Brodie, pp. 240\u2013242</ref><!-- Please view https://books.google.com/books?id=cG8hAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA278&dq=he+don't+believe+in+hanging+he+is+leader+hayes+stevens&hl=en&sa=X&ei=41DpUbWWIqfl4APY64GwCg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=he%20don't%20believe%20in%20hanging%20he%20is%20leader%20hayes%20stevens&f=false .  It is given as Hayes put it -->\n\nAs the responsibilities of the Ways and Means chairman had been divided, Stevens took the post of Chairman of the [[House Committee on Appropriations]], retaining control over the House's agenda.<ref>Trefousse, p. 176</ref>  Stevens focused on legislation that would secure the freedom promised by the newly ratified Thirteenth Amendment.<ref name=Soifer1616>Soifer, p. 1616</ref> He proposed and then co-chaired the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Reconstruction|Joint Committee on Reconstruction]] with Maine Senator [[William Pitt Fessenden]].<ref>Soifer, p. 1613</ref> This body, also called the Committee of Fifteen, investigated conditions in the South. It heard not only of the violence against African-Americans, but against Union loyalists, and against what southerners termed \"[[carpetbagger]]s\", Northerners who had journeyed south after the restoration of peace. Stevens declared: that \"our loyal brethren at the South, whether they be black or white\" required urgent protection \"from the barbarians who are now daily murdering them.\"<ref name=Soifer1616 />\n\nThe Committee of Fifteen began consideration of what would become the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Stevens had begun drafting versions in December 1865, before the Committee had even formed.<ref>Gans, p. 10</ref> In January 1866, a subcommittee including Stevens and [[John Bingham]] proposed two amendments: one giving Congress the unqualified power to secure equal rights, privileges, and protections for all citizens; the other explicitly annulling all racially discriminatory laws.<ref name=Halbrook8>Halbrook, pp. 6\u20138</ref> Stevens believed that the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and [[Organic Act]]s already bound the federal government to these principles, but that an amendment was necessary to allow enforcement against discrimination at the state level.<ref>Halbrook, p. 34</ref> The resolution providing for what would become the Fourteenth Amendment was watered down in Congress; during the closing debate, Stevens said these changes had shattered his lifelong dream in equality for all Americans.<ref>Stewart, p. 55\u201357</ref><ref>Du Bois, pp. 300\u2013307.</ref>  Nevertheless, stating that he lived among men, not angels, he supported the passage of the compromise amendment.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 178\u2013179</ref> Still, Stevens told the House: \"Forty acres of land and a hut would be more valuable to [the African-American] than the immediate right to vote.\"<ref>Bond, p. 300</ref>\n\n[[File:Hang Thaddeus.jpg|thumb|left|Based on ill-considered exchanges between Johnson and hecklers during the [[Swing Around the Circle]] this [[Thomas Nast]] cartoon excerpt shows Johnson delivering a pardon to Davis as Stevens and [[Wendell Phillips]] hang in the background.]]\nWhen Illinois Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] introduced legislation to reauthorize and expand the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], Stevens called the bill a \"robbery\" because it did not include sufficient provisions for land reform or protect the property of refugees given them by [[Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15|the military occupation of the South]].<ref name=Foner139>Foner (1980), pp. 139\u2013140</ref> Johnson vetoed the bill anyway, calling the Freedmen's Bureau unconstitutional, and decrying its cost: Congress had never purchased land, established schools, or provided financial help for \"our own people\".<ref>Foner, pp. 242\u2013247</ref><ref>Trefousse, pp. 180\u2013181</ref> Congress was unable to override Johnson's veto in February, but five months later passed a [[s:Index:Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill|similar bill]]. Stevens criticized the passage of the [[Southern Homestead Act of 1866]], arguing that the low-quality land it made available would not drive real economic growth for black families.<ref name=Foner139 />\n\nCongress overrode a Johnson veto to pass the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] (also introduced by Trumbull), granting African-Americans citizenship and equality before the law, and forbidding any action by a state to the contrary. Johnson made the gap between him and Congress wider when he accused Stevens, Sumner, and [[Wendell Phillips]] of trying to destroy the government.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 181\u2013186</ref>\n\nAfter Congress adjourned in July, the campaigning for the fall elections began.  Johnson embarked on a trip by rail, dubbed the \"[[Swing Around the Circle]]\", that won him few supporters; his arguments with hecklers were deemed undignified.  He attacked Stevens and other radicals during this tour. Stevens campaigned for firm measures against the South, his hand strengthened by violence in [[Memphis Riots of 1866|Memphis]] and [[New Orleans Riot|New Orleans]], where African-Americans and white Unionists had been attacked by mobs, including the police. Stevens was returned to Congress by his constituents; Republicans would have a two-thirds majority in both houses in the next Congress.<ref>Brodie, pp. 277\u2013289</ref>\n\n===Radical Reconstruction===\nIn January 1867, Stevens introduced [[Reconstruction Acts|legislation]] to divide the South into five districts, each commanded by an army general empowered to override civil authorities.  These military officers were to supervise elections with all males, of whatever race, entitled to vote, except for those who could not take an [[ironclad oath|oath of past loyalty]]\u2014most white Southerners could not. The states were to write new constitutions (subject to approval by Congress) and hold elections for state officials. Only if a state ratified the Fourteenth Amendment would its delegation be seated in Congress.<ref>Foner, pp. 273\u2013277</ref> The system gave power to a Republican coalition of freedmen (mobilized by the [[Union League]]), carpetbaggers, and co-operative Southerners (the last dubbed [[scalawag]]s by indignant ex-rebels) in most southern states.<ref>Foner, pp. 282\u2013283, 296\u2013299, 332\u2013333</ref> These states ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, which became part of the Constitution in mid-1868.<ref name=GPO>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/HMAN-112/html/HMAN-112-pg99.htm |title=Amendment XIV |publisher=US Government Printing Office |accessdate=June 23, 2013 |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202115456/http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/HMAN-112/html/HMAN-112-pg99.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nStevens introduced a [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], restricting Johnson from firing officials who had received Senate confirmation without getting that body's consent. The Tenure of Office Act was ambiguous, since it could be read to protect officeholders only during the tenure of the president who appointed them, and most of the officials the radicals sought to protect had been named by Lincoln. Chief among these was [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin Stanton]], a radical himself.<ref>Brodie, pp. 296\u2013303</ref>\n\nStevens steered a bill to enfranchise African-Americans in the District of Columbia through the House; the Senate passed it in 1867, and it was enacted over Johnson's veto. Congress was downsizing the Army for peacetime; Stevens offered an amendment, which became part of the bill as enacted, to have two regiments of African-American cavalry. His solicitude for African-Americans extended to the Native American; Stevens was successful in defeating a bill to place [[Indian reservation|reservations]] under state law, noting that the native people had often been abused by the states.<ref>Trefousse, p. 193</ref> An expansionist, he supported the railroads.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 194</ref> He added a stipulation into the [Transcontinental] Pacific Railroad Act requiring the applicable railroads to buy iron \"of American manufacture\" of the top price qualities.<ref>Ludwell Johnson \"Division and Reunion\" (New York: John Wiley, 1978), 110</ref> Although he sought to protect manufacturers with high tariffs, he also sought unsuccessfully to get a bill passed to protect labor with an eight-hour day in the District of Columbia.  Stevens advocated a bill to give government workers raises; it did not pass.<ref>Trefousse, p. 195</ref>\n\n==Impeaching the President==\n{{main|Impeachment of Andrew Johnson}}\nThe new [[40th Congress|Congress]], which convened on March 4, 1867, was not as aggressive in opposing Johnson as Stevens had hoped.  It soon adjourned until July, though its Judiciary Committee remained to hold hearings on whether the President should be impeached.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 210\u2013212</ref>  Stevens firmly supported impeachment, but others were less enthusiastic once the Senate elected Ohio's [[Benjamin Wade]] as its [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president ''pro tempore'']], next in line to the presidency in the absence of a vice president.  Wade was a radical who supported wealth redistribution; a speech of his in Kansas so impressed [[Karl Marx]] that he mentioned it in the first German edition of ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref>Foner, p. 309</ref> Also a supporter of women's suffrage, Wade was widely mistrusted for his views;<ref>Stewart, p. 39</ref> the prospect of his succession made some advocates of Johnson's removal more hesitant.  Stevens, however, strongly supported the removal of the President, and when the Judiciary Committee failed to report, tried to keep Congress in session until it did.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 217\u2013218</ref> Despite his opposition to its leader, Stevens worked with the administration on matters both supported; he obtained an appropriation for the [[purchase of Alaska]] and urged Secretary of State Seward to seek other territories to expand into.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 213\u2013214</ref>\n\nMost of Johnson's Cabinet supported him but Secretary of War Stanton did not, and with the [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]], war hero [[Ulysses S. Grant]], worked to undermine Johnson's Reconstruction policies.  Johnson obeyed the laws that Congress had passed, sometimes over his veto, though he often interpreted them in ways contrary to their intent.  After Stanton refused Johnson's request that he resign in August 1867, Johnson suspended Stanton, as permitted by the Tenure of Office Act, and made General Grant interim Secretary of War.<ref>Castel, pp. 136\u2013137</ref> Republicans campaigned in that year's election on the issue of African-American suffrage, but were met with a voter surge towards the Democrats, who opposed it.  Although no seats at Congress were directly at stake, voters in Ohio both defeated a referendum on black suffrage and elected the Democrats to the majority in [[Ohio General Assembly|the legislature]], meaning that Wade, whose term was due to expire in 1869, would not be reelected.<ref>Castel, pp. 146\u2013147</ref>\n\n[[File:TStevens-Johnson impeachment.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' woodcut of Stevens making his final argument to the House]]\nWhen Congress met again in December, although the Judiciary Committee voted 5\u20134 for impeachment, the House voted against it.<ref>Stewart, pp. 103\u2013111</ref> On January 13, 1868, the Senate overturned Johnson's suspension of Stanton.  Grant resigned as Secretary of War, and Stanton reclaimed his place.<ref>Castel, pp. 158\u2013159</ref> Nevertheless, on February 21, the President ousted Stanton from his position, appointing General [[Lorenzo Thomas]] in his place\u2014though Stanton barricaded himself in his office.<ref>Brodie, p. 334</ref><ref>Foner, p. 334</ref><!-- Yes, the same number! --> These actions caused great excitement in Washington, and in the House of Representatives, Stevens went from group to group on the floor, repeating, \"Didn't I tell you so?  What good did your moderation do you?  If you don't kill the beast, it will kill you.\"<ref>Trefousse, pp. 224\u2013225</ref> Stevens concluded the debate on a renewed impeachment resolution on February 24, though due to his poor health he was unable to complete his speech and gave it to the Clerk to read aloud.  He accused Johnson of usurping the powers of other branches of government, and of ignoring the will of the people.  He did not deny impeachment was a political matter, but \"this is not to be the temporary triumph of a political party, but is to endure in its consequence until the whole continent shall be filled with a free and untrammeled people or shall be a nest of shrinking, cowardly slaves.\"<ref>Trefousse, p. 225</ref><ref>Meltzer, p. 200</ref> The House voted 126\u201347 to impeach the President.<ref>Meltzer, p. 201</ref>\n\nStevens led the delegation of House members sent the following day to inform the Senate of the impeachment, though he had to be carried to its doors by his bearers. Elected to the committee charged with drafting articles of impeachment, his illness limited his involvement.  Nevertheless, dissatisfied with the committee's proposed articles, Stevens suggested another, that would become Article&nbsp;XI. This grounded the various accusations in statements Johnson had made denying the legitimacy of Congress due to the exclusion of the southern states, and stated that Johnson had tried to disobey the Reconstruction Acts. Stevens was one of the managers, or prosecutors, elected by the House to present its case in the impeachment trial.  Although Stevens was too ill to appear in the Senate on March 3, when the managers requested that Johnson be summoned (the President would appear only by his counsel, or defense managers), he was there ten days later when the summons was returnable. The ''[[New York Herald]]'' described him as  having a \"face of corpselike color, and rigidly twitching lips&nbsp;... a strange and unearthly apparition\u2014a reclused remonstrance from the tomb&nbsp;... the very embodiment of fanaticism, without a solitary leaven of justice or mercy&nbsp;... the avenging Nemesis of his party\u2014the sworn and implacable foe of the Executive of the nation\".<ref>Trefousse, pp. 226\u2013229</ref>\n\n[[File:Bingham-Stevens.jpg|thumb|left|Stevens (right) and [[John A. Bingham]] formally notify the Senate of Johnson's impeachment.  From ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.]]\nIncreasingly ill, Stevens took little part in the impeachment trial, at which the leading House manager was Massachusetts Representative [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]]. Stevens nourished himself on the Senate floor with raw eggs and [[Diamondback terrapin|terrapin]], port and brandy. He spoke only twice before making a closing argument for the House managers on April 27.  As he spoke, his voice weakened, and finally he allowed Butler to read the second half of his speech for him. Stevens focused on Article&nbsp;XI, taking the position that Johnson could be removed for political crimes; he need not have committed an offense against the law. The President, having sworn to faithfully execute the laws, had intentionally disobeyed the Tenure of Office Act after the Senate had refused to uphold his removal of Stanton, \"and now this offspring of assassination turns upon the Senate who have&nbsp;... rebuked him in a constitutional manner and bids them defiance. How can he escape the just vengeance of the law?\"<ref>Trefousse, pp. 231\u2013233</ref><ref>Stewart, pp. 233\u2013234</ref><!-- Again, the similar numbers in the parallel sources is a coincidence -->\n\nMost radicals were confident that Johnson would be convicted and removed from office.  Stevens, however, was never certain of the result as Chief Justice Chase (the former Treasury Secretary) made rulings that favored the defense, and he had no great confidence Republicans would stick together. On May 11, the Senate met in secret session, and senators gave speeches explaining how they intended to vote.  All Democrats were opposed, but an unexpectedly large number of Republicans also favored acquittal on some or all of the articles.  Counting votes, managers realized their best chance of gaining the required two-thirds for conviction was on the Stevens-inspired Article&nbsp;XI, and when the Senate assembled to give its verdict, they scheduled it to be voted upon first. The suspense was broken when Kansas Senator [[Edmund Ross]], whose position was uncertain, voted for acquittal.  This meant that, with the votes of those who remained, the President would not be convicted on that article.  The article failed, 35 in favor to 19 against. In the hope that delay would bring a different result, Republicans adjourned the Senate for ten days.  Stevens was carried from the Senate in his chair\u2014one observer described him as \"black with rage and disappointment\"\u2014and when those outside clamored for the result, Stevens shouted, \"The country is going to the devil!\"<ref>Stewart, pp. 275\u2013279</ref><ref>Trefousse, pp. 233\u2013234</ref>\n\n==Final months and death==\n[[File:Thaddeus Stevens Grave.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Stevens's grave in Lancaster]]\nDuring the recess of the impeachment court, the Republicans [[1868 Republican National Convention|met in convention]] in Chicago and nominated Grant for president.  Stevens did not attend, and was dismayed by the exclusion of African-American suffrage from the [[party platform]] as radical influence began to fade in the Republican Party.  When the Senate returned to session, it voted down Articles&nbsp;II and&nbsp;III by the same 35\u201319 margin as before, and Chase declared the President acquitted. Stevens did not give up on the idea of removing Johnson; in July, he proffered several more impeachment articles (the House refused to adopt them).<ref>Trefousse, pp. 234\u2013235</ref>  He offered a bill to divide Texas into several parts so as to gain additional Republican senators to vote out Johnson. It was defeated; the ''Herald'' stated, \"It is lamentable to see this old man, with one foot in the grave, pursuing the President with such vindictiveness.\"<ref>Brodie, pp. 356\u2013357</ref> Nevertheless, Stevens planned to revisit the question of impeachment when Congress met again in late 1868.<ref>Trefousse, p. 235</ref>\n\nBrodie suggested that Stevens's hatred of Johnson was the only thing keeping him from despair, aware as he was of the continued violence in the South, some of which was committed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].  Several of the southern states had been re-admitted by this time, and the murders and intimidation were aiding the Democrats there in restoring white rule. With the Republicans unwilling to embrace black suffrage in their platform and the Democrats opposed to it, Stevens feared Democratic victory in the 1868 elections might even bring back slavery. He told his fellow Pennsylvania politician, [[Alexander McClure]], \"My life has been a failure.  With all this great struggle of years in Washington, and the fearful sacrifice of life and treasure, I see little hope for the Republic.\", He took pride, he continued, in his role in establishing free public education in Pennsylvania.<ref>Brodie, pp. 361\u2013363</ref> When interviewed by a reporter seeking to gain his life story, Stevens replied, \"I have no history.

Stevens was in pain from his stomach ailments, from swollen feet, and from [[dropsy]]. By early August, he was unable to leave the house. He still received some visitors though, and correctly predicted to his friend and former student Simon Stevens (no relation) that Grant would win the election. On the afternoon of August 11, his doctor warned that he would probably not last through the night.  His longtime housekeeper and companion, Lydia Hamilton Smith, his nephew Thaddeus, and friends gathered by him.  Two black preachers came to pray by him, telling him that he had the prayers of all their people.  He sucked on ice to try to soothe the pain; his last words were a request for more of it.

African-American soldiers constituted the [[guard of honor]].  After a service there, his body was taken by funeral train to Lancaster, a city draped in black for the funeral.  Stevens was laid to rest in Shreiner's Cemetery (today the Shreiner-Concord Cemetery); it allowed burial of people of all races, although at the time of Stevens's interment, only one African-American was buried there.

Johnson]], vice president under [[Martin Van Buren]], who lived openly with a series of African-American slave mistresses.  Johnson was elected even though this became known during the 1836 campaign, a fact that Stevens notes, and expresses his bitterness about his inability to gain election by the legislature to the Senate, or to secure a Cabinet position.<ref>Brodie, pp. 90\u201391</ref>\n\nWhen Stevens died, Smith was at his bedside, along with his friend Simon Stevens, nephew Thaddeus Stevens Jr., two African-American nuns, and several other individuals.

Early biographical works on Stevens were composed by men who knew him, and reflected their viewpoints. Biographies at the turn of the twentieth century, such as those by [[Samuel McCall]] in 1899 and by James Albert Woodburn in 1913, presented Stevens favorably, as a sincere man, motivated by principle.<ref>Berlin, pp. 153\u2013154</ref> Early African-American historian [[W.

These historians, led by [[William Dunning]], taught that Reconstruction had been an opportunity for radical politicians, motivated by ill-will towards the South, to destroy what little of southern life and dignity the war had left.<ref name = \"B154\">Berlin, p. 154</ref><ref>Brodie, p. 370</ref><ref name = \"Castel\">Castel, pp. 220\u2013221</ref> Dunning himself deemed Stevens \"truculent, vindictive, and cynical\".<ref name = \"B154\" /> [[Lloyd Paul Stryker]], who wrote a highly favorable 1929 biography of Johnson, labeled Stevens as a \"horrible old man&nbsp;... craftily preparing to strangle the bleeding, broken body of the South\" and who thought it would be \"a beautiful thing\" to see \"the white men, especially the white women of the South, writhing under negro domination.\"<ref name = \"Castel\" /><ref>Brodie, pp. 369\u2013370</ref> In 1915, [[D.

''The Epic of America''. Boston: Little, Brown, 1931. p. 275.</ref> \n\nHistorians who penned biographies of Stevens in the late 1930s sought to move away from this perspective, seeking to rehabilitate him and his political career. Thomas F. Woodley, writing in 1937, shows admiration of Stevens, but he attributed Stevens's driving force to bitterness over his clubfoot. Alphonse Miller, in his 1939 biography, found that the former congressman was motivated by a desire for justice. Both men were convinced that recent books had not treated him fairly.  Richard Current's 1942 work reflected current [[Beardian]] historiography, which saw all American history, including Reconstruction, as a three-way economic struggle between the industrialists of the Northeast (represented by Stevens), the planters of the South, and the farmers of the Midwest. Current argued that Stevens was motivated in his Reconstruction policies by frustrated ambitions and a desire to use his political position to promote industrial capitalism and advance the Republican Party. He concluded that despite Stevens's egalitarian beliefs, he actually promoted inequality, for \"none had done more than he to bring on the age of Big Business, with its concentration of wealth.\"<ref>Berlin, pp. 155\u2013157</ref>\n\nWith Ralph Korngold's 1955 biography of Stevens, the [[neoabolitionism|neoabolitionist]] school of historians began to consider the former congressman. These professors rejected the earlier view that those who had gone South to aid the African-American after the war were \"rapscallion carpetbaggers\" defeated by \"saintly redeemers\". Instead, they applauded those who had sought to end slavery and forward civil rights, and castigated Johnson for obstructionism. They took the view that the African-American was central to Reconstruction, and the only things wrong with the congressional program were that it did not go far enough and that it stopped too soon.  Brodie's 1959 biography of Stevens was of this school. Controversial in its conclusions for being a [[psychobiography]], it found that Stevens was a \"consummate underdog who identified with the oppressed\" and whose intelligence won him success, while his consciousness of his clubfoot retarded his social development.<ref>Berlin, p. 157</ref><ref>Castel, pp. 222, 225</ref> According to Brodie, this also made him unwilling to marry a woman of his own social standing.<ref>Andreasen, pp. 76\u201377</ref>\n\nScholars who followed Brodie continued to chip away at the idea of Stevens as a vindictive dictator, who dominated Congress to get his way. In 1960, [[Eric McKitrick]] deemed Stevens \"a picturesque and adroit politician, but a very limited one\" whose career was \"a long comic sequence of devilish schemes which, one after another, kept blowing up in his face.\"<ref>Andreasen, p. 79</ref> From the mid-1970s onward, Foner argued that Stevens's role was in staking out radical position, but events, not Stevens, caused the Republicans to support him. [[Michael Les Benedict]] in 1974 suggested that Stevens's reputation as a dictator was based more on his personality than on his influence. In 1989, Allan Bogue found that as chairman of Ways and Means, Stevens was \"less than complete master\" of his committee.<ref>Andreasen, pp. 79\u201380</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Hans Trefousse]] stated in a 1969 study of the Radical Republicans that Stevens's \"one abiding passion was equality\".<ref>Andreasen, p. 75</ref> In 1991, he noted that Stevens \"was one of the most influential representatives ever to serve in Congress. [He dominated] the House with his wit, knowledge of parliamentary law, and sheer willpower, even though he was often unable to prevail.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Hans L.

A fierce opponent of slavery and discrimination against  [[African-Americans]], Stevens sought to secure their rights during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], in opposition to U.S. President [[Andrew Johnson]]. As chairman of the [[House Ways and Means Committee]] during the [[American Civil War]], he played a leading role, focusing his attention on defeating the Confederacy, financing the war with new taxes and borrowing, crushing the power of slave owners, ending slavery, and securing equal rights for the Freedmen.\n\nStevens was born in rural Vermont, in poverty, and with a [[club foot]], which left him with a permanent [[limp]].  He moved to Pennsylvania as a young man and quickly became a successful lawyer in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]].  He interested himself in municipal affairs, and then in politics. He was elected to the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]], where he became a strong advocate of free public education. Financial setbacks in 1842 caused him to move his home and practice to the larger city of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].  There, he joined the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], and was elected to Congress in 1848. His activities as a lawyer and politician in opposition to slavery cost him votes and he did not seek reelection in 1852.  After a brief flirtation with the [[Know-Nothing Party]], Stevens joined the newly formed Republican Party, and was elected to Congress again in 1858.  There, with fellow radicals such as Massachusetts Senator [[Charles Sumner]], he opposed the expansion of slavery and concessions to the South as the war came. \n\nStevens argued that slavery should not survive the war; he was frustrated by the slowness of U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to support his position.  He guided the government's financial legislation through the House as Ways and Means chairman.  As the war progressed towards a Northern victory, Stevens came to believe that not only should slavery be abolished, but that African-Americans should be given a stake in the South's future through the confiscation of land from planters to be distributed to the freedmen (see [[40 acres and a mule]]). His plans went too far for the Moderate Republicans and were not enacted.\n\nAfter the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]] in April 1865, Stevens came into conflict with the new president, Johnson, who sought rapid restoration of the seceded states without guarantees for freedmen. The difference in views caused an ongoing battle between Johnson and Congress, with Stevens leading the Radical Republicans. After gains in the 1866 election the radicals took control of Reconstruction away from Johnson. Stevens's last great battle was to secure in the House [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|articles of impeachment against Johnson]], though the Senate did not convict the President.  [[Historiography|Historiographical]] views of Stevens have dramatically shifted over the years, from the early 20th-century view of Stevens as reckless and motivated by hatred of the white South, to the perspective of the [[neoabolitionist]]s of the 1950s and afterwards, who applauded him for his [[Egalitarianism|commitment to equality]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nStevens was born in [[Danville, Vermont]], on April 4, 1792.  He was the second of four children, all boys, and was named to honor the [[Poland|Polish]] general who served in the American Revolution, [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko|Thaddeus Ko\u015bciuszko]]. His parents were Baptists who had emigrated from Massachusetts around 1786.  Thaddeus was born with a [[club foot]] which, at the time, was seen as a judgment from God for secret parental sin.  His older brother was born with the same condition in both feet.  The boys' father, Joshua Stevens, was a farmer and cobbler who struggled to make a living in Vermont. After fathering two more sons (born without disability) Joshua abandoned the children and his wife Sarah (n\u00e9e Morrill).  The circumstances of his departure and his subsequent fate are uncertain; he may have died at the [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1814)|Battle of Oswego]] during the [[War of 1812]].<ref>Trefousse, pp. 1\u20132</ref>\n\nSarah Stevens struggled to make a living from the farm, with the increasing aid of her sons.<ref>Meltzer, pp. 3\u20134</ref> She was determined that her sons improve themselves, and in 1807 moved the family to the neighboring town of [[Peacham, Vermont]], where she enrolled young Thaddeus in the Caledonia Grammar School (often called the Peacham Academy). He suffered much from the taunts of his classmates for his disability.  Later accounts describe him there as \"wilful, headstrong\" with \"an overwhelming burning desire to secure an education.\"<ref>Brodie, pp. 26\u201327</ref>\n\nAfter graduation, he enrolled at the [[University of Vermont]] but suspended his studies due to the federal government's appropriation of campus buildings during the [[War of 1812]].<ref>History of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, with Biographical Sketches of Many of its Pioneers and Prominent Men; Chapter XXI. The Bench and Bar of Lancaster County</ref> Stevens then enrolled in the [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] class at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]].  At Dartmouth, despite a stellar academic career, he was not elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]; this was reportedly a scarring experience for him.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 4\u20135</ref><ref>Brodie, pp. 27\u201329</ref>\n\nStevens graduated from Dartmouth in 1814, and was chosen as a speaker at the [[commencement ceremony]].  Afterwards, he returned to Peacham and briefly taught there.  Stevens also began to [[reading law|study law]] with [[John Mattocks]].  In early 1815, correspondence with friend [[Samuel Merrill (Indiana)|Samuel Merrill]], a fellow Vermonter who had moved to [[York, Pennsylvania]] to become preceptor of the [[York College of Pennsylvania|York Academy]], led to an offer for Stevens to join the academy faculty. He moved to York to teach, and continued the study of law in the offices of David Cossett.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 5\u20137</ref>\n\n==Pennsylvania attorney and politician==\n\n===Gettysburg lawyer===\nIn Pennsylvania, Stevens taught school at the [[York College of Pennsylvania|York Academy]] and continued his studies for the bar.<ref name = \"t11\" />  Local lawyers passed a resolution barring from membership anyone who had \"followed any other profession while preparing for admission,\"<ref>History of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, with Biographical Sketches of Many of its Pioneers and Prominent Men:\nChapter XXI. The Bench and Bar of Lancaster County</ref> a restriction likely aimed at Stevens. Undaunted, he reportedly (according to a story he often retold) presented himself and four bottles of [[Madeira wine]] to the examining board in nearby [[Harford County, Maryland]], and few questions were asked but much wine drunk. He left [[Bel Air, Maryland|Bel Air]] the next morning with a certificate allowing him, through [[Admission on motion|reciprocity]], to practice law anywhere.  Stevens then went to [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], the seat of [[Adams County, Pennsylvania|Adams County]],<ref name = \"t11\">Trefousse, p. 11</ref><ref>Meltzer, p. 14</ref> where he opened an office in September 1816.<ref name = \"b32\">Brodie, p. 32</ref>\n\nStevens knew no one in Gettysburg and initially had little success as a lawyer.  His breakthrough, in mid-1817, was a case in which a farmer who had been jailed for debt later killed one of the [[constable]]s who had arrested him.  His defense, although unsuccessful, impressed the local people and he never lacked for business thereafter.<ref name = \"b32\" /> In his legal career, he demonstrated the propensity for sarcasm that would later mark him as a politician, once telling a judge who accused him of manifesting [[contempt of court]], \"Sir, I am doing my best to conceal it.\"<ref>Metzger, p. 17</ref>\n\nMany who memorialized Stevens after his death in 1868 agreed on his talent as a lawyer. He was involved in the first ten cases to reach the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]] from Adams County after he began practice, and won nine. One case he later wished he had not won was ''Butler v. Delaplaine'', in which he successfully reclaimed a slave on behalf of her owner.<ref name = \"profits\">Trefouse, pp. 13\u201316</ref>\n\nIn Gettysburg, Stevens also began his involvement in politics, serving six one-year terms on the [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] council between 1822 and 1831 and becoming its president.<ref>Glatfelter, p. 163</ref> He took the profits from his practice and invested them in Gettysburg real estate, becoming the largest landowner in the community by 1825, and had an interest in several [[iron furnace]]s outside town.<ref name = \"profits\" /> In addition to assets, he acquired enemies; after the death of a pregnant black woman in Gettysburg, there were anonymous letter-writers to newspapers, hinting that Stevens was culpable.  The rumors dogged him for years;<ref>Trefousse, pp. 21\u201322</ref> when one newspaper opposed to Stevens printed a letter in 1831 naming him as the killer, he successfully sued for libel.<ref>Brodie, pp. 42\u201345</ref>\n\n===Anti-Masonry===\nStevens's first political cause was [[Anti-Masonry]], which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance and death of [[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|William Morgan]], a [[Freemasonry|Mason]] in [[Upstate New York]]; fellow Masons were presumed to be the killers of Morgan because they disapproved of his publishing a book revealing the order's secret rites. Since the leading candidate in opposition to President [[John Quincy Adams]] was General [[Andrew Jackson]], a Mason who mocked opponents of the order, Anti-Masonry became closely associated with opposition to Jackson, and to his [[Jacksonian democracy]] policies once he was elected president in 1828.<ref>Brodie, pp. 38\u201339</ref>\n\nJackson's adherents were from the old [[Democratic-Republican Party]] and eventually became known as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Stevens had been told by fellow attorney (and future president) [[James Buchanan]] that he could advance politically if he joined them, but Stevens could not support Jackson, out of principle.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 17, 19</ref> For Stevens, Anti-Masonry became one means of opposing Jackson; he may also have had personal reasons as the Masons barred \"cripples\" from joining. Stevens took to Anti-Masonry with enthusiasm, and remained loyal to it after most Pennsylvanians had dropped the cause. His biographer, Hans Trefousse, suggested that another reason for Stevens's virulence was an attack of disease in the late 1820s that cost him his hair (he thereafter wore wigs, often ill-fitting), and \"the unwelcome illness may well have contributed to his unreasonable fanaticism concerning the Masons.\"<ref>Trefousse, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nBy 1829, Anti-Masonry had evolved into a political party, the [[Anti-Masonic Party]], that proved popular in rural central Pennsylvania. Stevens quickly became prominent in the movement, attending the party's first two national conventions in 1830 and 1831.  At the latter, he pressed the candidacy of Supreme Court Justice [[John McLean]] as the party's presidential candidate, but in vain as the nomination fell to former Attorney General [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]]. Jackson was easily reelected; the crushing defeat (Wirt won only Vermont) caused the party to disappear in most places, though it remained powerful in Pennsylvania for several years.<ref>Metzger, pp. 27\u201329</ref><ref>Trefousse, pp. 26\u201331</ref>\n\nIn September 1833, Stevens was elected to a one-year term in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as an Anti-Mason, and once in the capital [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] sought to have the body establish a committee to investigate Masonry. Stevens gained attention far beyond Pennsylvania for his oratory against Masonry, and also quickly became expert in legislative maneuvers. In 1835, a split among the Democrats put the Anti-Masons in control of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]], the legislature. Granted subpoena powers, Stevens summoned leading state politicians who were Masons, including Governor [[George Wolf]]. The witnesses [[Taking the Fifth|invoked their Fifth Amendment right]] against self-incrimination, and when Stevens verbally abused one of them, it created a backlash that caused his own party to end the investigation. The fracas cost Stevens reelection in 1836, and the issue of Anti-Masonry died in Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, Stevens remained an opponent of the order for the rest of his life.<ref>Brodie, pp. 57\u201359</ref><ref>Trefousse, pp. 33\u201337, 42\u201343</ref>\n\n===Crusader for education===\nBeginning with his early years in Gettysburg, Stevens advanced the cause of universal education.  At the time, no state outside New England had free public education for all. In Pennsylvania, there was free education in [[Philadelphia]], but elsewhere in the state, those wishing to have their children educated without paying tuition had to swear a [[pauper's oath]]. Stevens opened his extensive private library to the public and gave up his presidency of the borough council, believing his service on the [[school board]] more important.<ref>Metzger, pp. 31\u201332</ref> In 1825, he was elected by the voters of Adams County as a trustee of Gettysburg Academy.  As the school was failing, Stevens got [[county (United States)|county]] voters to agree to pay its debt, allowing it to be sold as a Lutheran seminary.  It was granted the right to award college degrees in 1831 as Pennsylvania College, and in 1921 became [[Gettysburg College]]. Stevens gave the school land upon which a building could be raised and for many years served as a trustee.<ref>Brodie, p. 59</ref><ref>Glatfelter, pp. 164\u2013166</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=College History|url=http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/college_history/|publisher=Gettysburg College|accessdate=July 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718173606/http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/college_history/|archive-date=2013-07-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File: Stevens Gettysburg portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Stevens by [[Jacob Eichholtz]] now owned by Gettysburg College]]\nIn April 1834, Stevens, working with Governor Wolf, guided through the legislature an act to allow districts across the state to vote on whether to have public schools and the taxes to pay for them. Gettysburg's district voted in favor and also elected Stevens as a school director, where he served until 1839.  Tens of thousands of voters signed petitions urging a reversal.  The result was a repeal bill that easily passed the [[Pennsylvania Senate]]. It was widely believed the bill would also pass the House, and be enacted despite opposition by Stevens.  When he rose to speak on April 11, 1835, he defended the new educational system, stating that it would actually save money, and demonstrated how.  He stated opponents were seeking to separate the poor into a lower caste than themselves, and accused the rich of greed and failure to empathize with the poor. Stevens argued, \"Build not your monuments of brass or marble, but make them of everliving mind!\"<ref>Brodie, pp. 60\u201361</ref><ref>Trefousse, pp. 39\u201340</ref> The repeal bill was defeated; Stevens was given wide credit.  Trefousse suggested that the victory was not due to Stevens's eloquence, but due to his influence, combined with that of Governor Wolf.<ref>Trefousse, p. 40</ref>\n\n===Political change; move to Lancaster===\nIn 1838, Stevens ran again for the legislature.  He hoped that if the remaining Anti-Masons and the emerging Whig Party gained a majority, he could be elected to the [[United States Senate]], whose members until 1913 were chosen by state legislatures.  A campaign, dirty even by the standards of the times, followed. The result was a Democrat elected as governor, Whig control of the state Senate, and the state House in dispute, with a number of seats from Philadelphia in question, though Stevens won his seat in Adams County.  Stevens sought to have those Philadelphia Democrats excluded, which would create a Whig majority that could elect a Speaker and himself as senator.  Amid rioting in Harrisburg\u2014later known as the \"[[Buckshot War]]\"\u2014Stevens's ploy backfired, with the Democrats taking control of the House.  Stevens remained in the legislature most years through 1842, but the episode cost him much of his political influence, as the Whigs blamed him for the debacle and were increasingly unwilling to give leadership to someone who had not yet joined their party. Nevertheless, he supported the pro-business and pro-development Whig stances.<ref name=\"Brodie-p75-84\">Brodie, pp. 75\u201384</ref> He campaigned for the Whig candidate in the 1840 presidential election, former general  [[William Henry Harrison]].  Though Stevens later alleged that Harrison had promised him a Cabinet position if elected, he received none, and any influence ended when Harrison died after a month in office, to be succeeded by [[John Tyler]], a southerner hostile to Stevens's stances on slavery.<ref name=\"Brodie-p75-84\" /><ref>Trefousse, pp. 57\u201367</ref>\n\nAlthough Stevens was the most successful lawyer in Gettysburg, he had accrued debt due to his business interests. Refusing to take advantage of the bankruptcy laws, he felt he needed to move to a larger municipality in order to gain the money to pay his obligations.  In 1842, Stevens moved his home and practice to the city of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]].  He knew [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]] was an Anti-Mason and Whig stronghold, which ensured that he retained a political base. Within a short period, he was earning more than any other Lancaster attorney; by 1848 he had reduced his debts to $30,000 and paid them off soon after. It was in Lancaster that he engaged the services of [[Lydia Hamilton Smith]], a housekeeper, whose racial makeup was described as [[mulatto]], and who remained with him the rest of his life.<!-- please do not add anything about Mrs. Smith here, the question of her relationship with him is discussed below --><ref>Trefousse, pp. 68\u201369</ref>\n\n==Abolitionist and prewar congressman==\n\n===Evolution of views===\nIn the 1830s, few sought the immediate eradication of slavery.  The [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] was young and only recently had figures such as [[William Lloyd Garrison]] taken on the fight.<ref name=\"Brodie, pp. 105\u2013106\">Brodie, pp. 105\u2013106</ref> Stevens's reason for adopting slavery as a cause has been disputed among his recent biographers. Richard Current, in 1942, suggested it was out of ambition; [[Fawn Brodie]], in her controversial 1959 psychobiography of Stevens, suggested it was out of identification with the downtrodden, based on his handicap.<ref>Berlin, pp. 155\u2013158</ref> Trefousse, in his 1997 work, also suggested that Stevens's feelings towards the downtrodden were a factor, combined with remorse over the ''Butler'' case, but that ambition was unlikely to have been a major motivator, as Stevens's fervor in the anti-slavery cause inhibited his career.<ref>Trefousse, p. 46</ref>\n\n[[File:Thaddeus Stevens House.JPG|thumb|upright|Stevens's home on Queen Street, Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]\nAt the [[1837 Pennsylvania constitutional convention]], Stevens, who was a delegate, fought against the [[disenfranchisement]] of African-Americans (see [[Black suffrage in Pennsylvania]]). <ref>Meltzer, pp. 52\u201353</ref>  According to historian [[Eric Foner]], \"When Stevens refused to sign the 1837 constitution because of its voting provision, he announced his commitment to a non-racial definition of American citizenship to which he would adhere for the remainder of his life\".<ref name=\"Foner-p143\">Foner, p. 143</ref> After he moved to Lancaster, a city not far from the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]], he became active in the [[Underground Railroad]], not only defending people believed to be fugitive slaves, but coordinating the movements of those seeking freedom.<ref>Trefousse, p. 73</ref>  A 2003 renovation at his former home in Lancaster disclosed that there was a hidden cistern, attached to the main building by a concealed tunnel, in which escaped slaves hid.<ref name = \"Carlson\">{{cite web|last=Carlson|first=Peter|title=Thaddeus Stevens|publisher =Weder History Group|url=http://www.historynet.com/thaddeus-stevens.htm|date=February 19, 2013|accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=James A.|last=Delle|first2=Mary Ann|last2=Levine|url=http://digitalcommons.buffalostate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1094&context=neha|title=Excavations at the Thaddeus Stevens and Lydia Hamilton Smith Site, Lancaster, Pennsylvania: Archaeological Evidence for the Underground Railroad|journal=Northeast Historical Archaeology|volume=33|issue=1|publisher=State University of New York College at Buffalo|location=Buffalo, N.Y.|accessdate=July 15, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325173644/http://digitalcommons.buffalostate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1094&context=neha|archivedate=March 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nStevens, until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], took the public position that he supported slavery's end and opposed its expansion.

There was opposition to him at the Whig convention.  Some delegates felt that because Stevens had been late to join the party, he should not receive the nomination; others disliked his stance on slavery.  He narrowly won the nomination.  In a strong year for Whigs nationally, Taylor was chosen as president and Stevens was elected to Congress.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 76\u201377</ref>\n\n{{quote box | align = right | width = 27em | salign = right\n| quote =  It is my purpose nowhere in these remarks to make personal reproaches; I entertain no ill-will toward any human being, nor any brute, that I know of, not even the [Democratic] skunk across the way to which I referred.

Thaddeus Stevens Society.  Retrieved on June 17, 2013.</ref>}}\n\nWhen the [[31st United States Congress]] convened in December 1849, Stevens took his seat, joining other newly elected slavery opponents such as [[Salmon P. Chase]]. Stevens spoke out against the [[Compromise of 1850]], crafted by Kentucky Senator [[Henry Clay]], that gave victories to both North and South, but would allow for some of the [[territories of the United States]] recently gained from Mexico to become slave states.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 79\u201380</ref> In June, as the debates continued, he stated, \"This word 'compromise' when applied to human rights and constitutional rights I abhor\".<ref>Trefousse, p. 81</ref> Nevertheless, the pieces of legislation that made up the Compromise passed, including the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], which Stevens found particularly offensive.<ref>Meltzer, p. 94</ref> Although many Americans hoped that the Compromise would bring sectional peace, Stevens warned that it would be \"the fruitful mother of future rebellion, disunion, and civil war\".<ref>Brodie, p. 114</ref>\n\nStevens was easily renominated and reelected in 1850, even though his stance caused him problems among pro-Compromise Whigs.<ref name=\"Brodie, pp. 116\u2013119\">Brodie, pp. 116\u2013119</ref> In 1851, Stevens was one of the defense lawyers in the trial of 38 African-Americans and three others in federal court in Philadelphia on treason charges.  The defendants had been implicated in the so-called [[Christiana Riot]], in which an attempt to enforce a Fugitive Slave Act warrant had resulted in the killing of the slaveowner. Justice [[Robert Cooper Grier|Robert Grier]] of the U.S. Supreme Court, as [[circuit justice]], tried the case, and [[Directed verdict|instructed the jury to acquit]] on the grounds that though the defendants might be guilty of murder or riot, they were not charged with that, and were not guilty of treason.  The well-publicized incident (and others like it) increased polarization over the issue of slavery and made Stevens a prominent face of Northern abolitionism.<ref name=\"Brodie, pp. 116\u2013119\"/><ref name=Bond305>Bond, p. 305.</ref>\n\nDespite this trend, Stevens suffered political problems.  He left the Whig caucus in December 1851, when his colleagues would not join him in seeking the repeal of the offensive elements of the Compromise, though he supported its unsuccessful 1852 candidate for president, General [[Winfield Scott]]. His political opposition, and local dislike of his stance on slavery and participation in the treason trial, made him unlikely to win renomination, and he sought only to pick his successor.  His choice was defeated for the Whig nomination.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\n===Know-Nothing and Republican===\nOut of office, Stevens concentrated on the practice of law in Lancaster, remaining one of the leading attorneys in the state.  He stayed active in politics, and in 1854, to gain more votes for the anti-slavery movement, he joined the nativist [[Know Nothing Party]].  The members were pledged not to speak of party deliberations (thus, they knew nothing), and Stevens was attacked for his membership in a group with similar rules of secrecy as the Masons. In 1855, Stevens joined the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].  Other former Whigs who were anti-slavery joined as well, including [[William H. Seward]] of New York, [[Charles E. Sumner]] of Massachusetts, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] of Illinois.<ref>Brodie, pp. 121\u2013123</ref>\n\nStevens was a delegate to the [[1856 Republican National Convention]], where he supported Justice McLean, as he had in 1832.  The convention, however, nominated [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], whom Stevens actively supported in the race against his fellow Lancastrian, the Democratic candidate James Buchanan.  Nonetheless, Pennsylvania helped elect Buchanan.<ref>Brodie, pp. 129\u2013130</ref> Stevens returned to the practice of law, but in 1858, with the President and his party unpopular and the nation torn by such controversies as the [[Dred Scott decision]], Stevens saw an opportunity to return to Congress. As the Republican nominee, he was easily elected.  Democratic papers were appalled.  One banner headline read, \"Niggerism Triumphant\".<ref>Trefousse, pp. 95\u201397</ref>\n\n===1860 election; secession crisis===\nStevens took his seat in the [[36th United States Congress]] in December 1859, only days after the hanging of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], who had attacked the federal arsenal at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] hoping to cause a slave insurrection.  Stevens opposed Brown's violent actions at the time, though later, he was more approving. Sectional tensions spilled over into the House, which proved unable to elect a [[Speaker of the United States House]] for eight weeks.  Stevens was active in the bitter flow of invective from both sides; at one point, Mississippi Congressman [[William Barksdale]] drew a knife on him, though no blood was spilled.<ref>Brodie, pp. 130\u2013132</ref>\n\n[[File: Thaddeus as doctor.jpg|thumb|right|Southern view of the proposed compromises of 1860 and 1861, with \"Dr. North\" (Stevens) proposing to cut the South's legs off by means of constitutional amendment.  Stevens actually opposed such measures.]]\nWith the Democrats unable to agree on a single presidential candidate, the [[1860 Republican National Convention]] in Chicago became crucial, as the nominee would be in a favorable position to become president. Prominent figures in the party such as Seward and Lincoln sought the nomination.  Stevens continued to support the 75-year-old Justice McLean. Beginning on the second ballot, most Pennsylvania delegates supported Lincoln, helping to win the Illinoisan the nomination. As the Democrats put up no candidate in his district, Stevens was assured of reelection to the House and campaigned for Lincoln in Pennsylvania. Lincoln won a majority in the Electoral College.  The [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect's]] known opposition to the expansion of slavery caused immediate talk of secession in the southern states, a threat that Stevens had downplayed during the campaign.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 100\u2013103</ref><ref>Brodie, p. 133</ref>\n\nCongress convened in December 1860, with several of the southern states already pledging to secede.  Stevens was unyielding in opposing efforts to appease the southerners, such as the [[Crittenden Compromise]], which would have enshrined slavery as beyond constitutional amendment.<ref>Metzger, pp. 119\u2013121</ref> He stated, in a remark widely quoted both North and South, that rather than offer concessions because of Lincoln's election, he would see \"this Government crumble into a thousand atoms\", and that the forces of the United States would crush any rebellion.<ref>Trefousse, p. 107</ref> Despite Stevens's protests, the [[lame duck (politics)|lame-duck]] Buchanan administration did little in response to the secession votes, allowing most federal resources in the South to fall into rebel hands. Many, even in the abolition movement, were content to let it be so and to let the South go its own way.  Stevens did not agree, and the congressman was \"undoubtedly pleased\"  by Lincoln's statement in [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|his first inaugural address]] on March 4, 1861, that he would \"hold, occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the Government\".<ref>Trefousse, p. 109</ref><ref>Brodie, p. 139</ref>\n\n==American Civil War==\n\n===Slavery===\nWhen the war began in April 1861, Stevens argued that the Confederates were revolutionaries, to be crushed by force. He also believed that the Confederacy had placed itself beyond the protection of the U.S. Constitution by making war, and in a reconstituted United States, slavery would have no place. Speaker [[Galusha Grow]], whose views placed him with Stevens among the members becoming known as the [[Radical Republicans]] (for their position on slavery, as opposed to the Conservative or [[Moderate Republicans]]), appointed him as chairman of the [[House Ways and Means Committee]]. This position gave him power over the House's agenda.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 109\u2013114</ref>\n\n{{quote box | align = right | width = 23em | salign = right| quote = Abolition\u2014Yes! abolish everything on the face of the earth but this Union; free every slave\u2014slay every traitor\u2014burn every rebel mansion, if these things are necessary to preserve this temple of freedom to the world and to our posterity.\n| source =\u2014Stevens accepting renomination for his congressional seat, September 1, 1862<ref>{{cite book|author=Thaddeus Stevens|title=The Selected Papers of Thaddeus Stevens: January 1814-March 1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0Fs655TKfsC&pg=PA322|year=1997|location=Pittsburgh, Pa.|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|page=322|isbn=9780822970453}}</ref>}}\n\nIn July 1861, Stevens secured the passage of [[First Confiscation Act|an act]] to confiscate the property, including slaves, of certain rebels.

By March 1862, to Stevens's exasperation, the most Lincoln had publicly supported was gradual emancipation in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border states]], with the masters compensated by the federal government.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 118\u2013119</ref>\n\nStevens and other radicals were frustrated at how slow Lincoln was to adopt their policies for emancipation; according to Brodie, \"Lincoln seldom succeeded in matching Stevens's pace, though both were marching towards the same bright horizon\".<ref>Brodie, p. 153</ref> In April 1862, Stevens wrote to a friend, \"As for future hopes, they are poor as Lincoln is nobody.\"<ref>Trefousse, p. 119</ref> The radicals aggressively pushed the issue, provoking Lincoln to comment: \"Stevens, Sumner and [Massachusetts Senator Henry] [[Henry Wilson|Wilson]] simply haunt me with their importunities for a Proclamation of Emancipation.

Stevens, who had been there supervising operations, was hastened away by his workers against his will. General [[Jubal Early]] looted and vandalized the Forge, causing a loss to Stevens of about $80,000. Early said that the North had done the same to southern figures, and that Stevens was well known for his vindictiveness towards the South.<ref>Trefousse, p. 134</ref> Asked if he would have taken the congressman to [[Libby Prison]] in Richmond, Early replied that he would have hanged Stevens and divided his bones among the Confederate states.<ref>Brodie, p. 180</ref>\n\nStevens pushed Congress to pass a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation was a wartime measure, did not apply to all slaves, and might be reversed by peacetime courts; an amendment would be slavery's end.<ref name = \"Carlson\" /> The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]{{efn|James Ashley introduced the amendment in December 1863.

Urged on by Stevens,<ref name=Bond305 /> it voted to authorize the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands]], with a mandate (though no funding) to set up schools and to distribute \"not more than forty acres\" [16 ha] of confiscated Confederate land to each family of freed slaves.<ref>Bond, p. 304</ref>\n\n===Financing the war===\n\nStevens worked closely with Lincoln administration officials on legislation to finance the war. Within a day of his appointment as Ways and Means chairman, he had reported a bill for a war loan. Legislation to pay the soldiers Lincoln had already called into service and to allow the administration to borrow to prosecute the war quickly followed. These acts and more were pushed through the House by Stevens.  To defeat the delaying tactics of [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperhead]] opponents, he had the House set debate limits as short as half a minute.<ref>Brodie, pp. 150\u2013151</ref>\n\nStevens played a major part in the passage of the [[Legal Tender Cases|Legal Tender Act of 1862]], when for the first time the United States issued currency backed only by its own credit, not by gold or silver. Early makeshifts to finance the war, such as war bonds, had failed as it became clear the war would not be short.<ref>Smock, pp. 193\u2013194</ref> In 1863, Stevens aided the passage of the [[National Banking Act]], that required that banks limit their currency issues to the number of federal bonds that they were required to hold. The system endured for a half-century until supplanted by the [[Federal Reserve System]] in 1913.<ref>Trefousse, p. 131</ref>\n\nAlthough the Legal Tender legislation allowed for the payment of government obligations in paper money, Stevens was unable to get the Senate to agree that interest on the national debt should be paid with [[greenback (money)|greenbacks]].<ref>Brodie, pp. 174\u2013175</ref>  As the value of paper money dropped, Stevens railed against gold speculators, and in June 1864 after consultation with Treasury Secretary [[Salmon P. Chase]], proposed what became known as the Gold Bill\u2014to abolish the gold market by forbidding its sale by brokers or for future delivery. It passed Congress in June; the chaos caused by the lack of an organized gold market caused the value of paper to drop even faster.

He would have preferred to vote for the sitting vice president, [[Hannibal Hamlin]], as Lincoln's running mate in 1864, but his delegation voted to cast the state's ballots for the administration's favored candidate, Military Governor of Tennessee [[Andrew Johnson]], a War Democrat who had been a Tennessee senator and elected governor.

Lincoln replied, \"Stevens, this is a pretty big hog we are trying to catch and to hold when we catch him.  We must take care that he does not slip away from us.\"<ref>Trefousse, p. 157</ref> Never to see Lincoln again, Stevens left with \"a homely metaphor but no real certainty of having left as much as a thumbprint on Lincoln's policy.\"<ref>Brodie, p. 216</ref> On the evening of April 14, 1865, Lincoln [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]].  Stevens did not attend the ceremonies when Lincoln's funeral train stopped in Lancaster; he was said to be ill. Trefousse speculated he may avoided the rites for other reasons.  According to Lincoln biographer [[Carl Sandburg]], Stevens stood at a railroad bridge and lifted his hat.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nIn May 1865, Andrew Johnson began what came to be known as \"[[Presidential Reconstruction]]\": recognizing a provisional government of Virginia led by [[Francis Harrison Pierpont]], calling for other former rebel states to organize constitutional conventions, declaring amnesty for many southerners, and issuing individual pardons to even more. Johnson did not push the states to protect the rights of freed slaves, and immediately began to counteract the land reform policies of the Freedmen's Bureau. These actions outraged Stevens and others who took his view. The radicals saw that freedmen in the South risked losing the economic and political liberty necessary to sustain emancipation from slavery. They began to call for [[universal manhood suffrage|universal male suffrage]] and continued their demands for land reform.<ref>Meltzer, pp. 165\u2013167</ref><ref>Trefousse, pp. 163\u2013164</ref>\n\nStevens wrote to Johnson that his policies were gravely damaging the country and that he should call a special session of Congress, which was not scheduled to meet until December. When his communications were ignored, Stevens began to discuss with other radicals how to prevail over Johnson when the two houses convened.  Congress has the constitutional power to be the judge of whether those seeking to be its members are properly elected; Stevens urged that no senators or representatives from the South be seated.<ref name = \"brodieparts\">Brodie, pp. 225\u2013230, 234\u2013239</ref> He argued that the states should not be readmitted as thereafter Congress would lack the power to force race reform.<ref>Brodie, p. 231</ref>\n\nIn September, Stevens gave a widely reprinted speech in Lancaster in which he set forth what he wanted for the South.  He proposed that the government confiscate the estates of the largest 70,000 landholders there, those who owned more than {{convert|200|acres}}.  Much of this property he wanted [[40 acres and a mule|distributed in plots of {{convert|40|acre}}]] to the freedmen; other lands would go to reward loyalists in both North and South, or to meet government obligations. He warned that under the President's plan, the southern states would send rebels to Congress who would join with northern Democrats and Johnson to govern the nation and perhaps undo emancipation.<ref>Brodie, pp. 231\u2013233</ref>\n\nThrough late 1865, the southern states held white-only balloting and in congressional elections, chose many former rebels, most prominently Confederate Vice President [[Alexander Stephens]], voted as senator by the [[Georgia Legislature]]. Violence against African-Americans was common and unpunished in the South; the new legislatures enacted [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]], depriving the freedmen of most civil rights. These actions, seen as provocative in the North, both privately dismayed Johnson and helped turn northern public opinion against the president.<ref name = \"brodieparts\" /> Stevens proclaimed that \"This is not a 'white man's Government!' ....To say so is political blasphemy, for it violates the fundamental principles of our gospel of liberty.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Trefousse|title=Thaddeus Stevens|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUPqCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA177|page=177|isbn=9780807864999|date=2000-11-09}}</ref>\n\n===Congressional Reconstruction===\n[[File:Thaddeus Stevens2.jpg|thumb|right|Stevens in a thoughtful pose]]\nBy this time, Stevens was in his seventies and in poor health; he was carried everywhere in a special chair. When Congress convened in early December 1865, Stevens made arrangements with the [[Clerk of the House of Representatives|Clerk of the House]] that when the roll was called, the names of the Southern electees be omitted. The Senate also excluded Southern claimants. A new congressman, Ohio's [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], described Stevens: \"He is radical throughout, except, I am told, he don't believe in hanging.  He is leader.\"<ref>Brodie, pp. 240\u2013242</ref><!-- Please view https://books.google.com/books?id=cG8hAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA278&dq=he+don't+believe+in+hanging+he+is+leader+hayes+stevens&hl=en&sa=X&ei=41DpUbWWIqfl4APY64GwCg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=he%20don't%20believe%20in%20hanging%20he%20is%20leader%20hayes%20stevens&f=false .  It is given as Hayes put it -->\n\nAs the responsibilities of the Ways and Means chairman had been divided, Stevens took the post of Chairman of the [[House Committee on Appropriations]], retaining control over the House's agenda.<ref>Trefousse, p. 176</ref>  Stevens focused on legislation that would secure the freedom promised by the newly ratified Thirteenth Amendment.<ref name=Soifer1616>Soifer, p. 1616</ref> He proposed and then co-chaired the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Reconstruction|Joint Committee on Reconstruction]] with Maine Senator [[William Pitt Fessenden]].<ref>Soifer, p. 1613</ref> This body, also called the Committee of Fifteen, investigated conditions in the South. It heard not only of the violence against African-Americans, but against Union loyalists, and against what southerners termed \"[[carpetbagger]]s\", Northerners who had journeyed south after the restoration of peace. Stevens declared: that \"our loyal brethren at the South, whether they be black or white\" required urgent protection \"from the barbarians who are now daily murdering them.\"<ref name=Soifer1616 />\n\nThe Committee of Fifteen began consideration of what would become the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Stevens had begun drafting versions in December 1865, before the Committee had even formed.<ref>Gans, p. 10</ref> In January 1866, a subcommittee including Stevens and [[John Bingham]] proposed two amendments: one giving Congress the unqualified power to secure equal rights, privileges, and protections for all citizens; the other explicitly annulling all racially discriminatory laws.<ref name=Halbrook8>Halbrook, pp. 6\u20138</ref> Stevens believed that the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and [[Organic Act]]s already bound the federal government to these principles, but that an amendment was necessary to allow enforcement against discrimination at the state level.<ref>Halbrook, p. 34</ref> The resolution providing for what would become the Fourteenth Amendment was watered down in Congress; during the closing debate, Stevens said these changes had shattered his lifelong dream in equality for all Americans.<ref>Stewart, p. 55\u201357</ref><ref>Du Bois, pp. 300\u2013307.</ref>  Nevertheless, stating that he lived among men, not angels, he supported the passage of the compromise amendment.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 178\u2013179</ref> Still, Stevens told the House: \"Forty acres of land and a hut would be more valuable to [the African-American] than the immediate right to vote.\"<ref>Bond, p. 300</ref>\n\n[[File:Hang Thaddeus.jpg|thumb|left|Based on ill-considered exchanges between Johnson and hecklers during the [[Swing Around the Circle]] this [[Thomas Nast]] cartoon excerpt shows Johnson delivering a pardon to Davis as Stevens and [[Wendell Phillips]] hang in the background.]]\nWhen Illinois Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] introduced legislation to reauthorize and expand the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], Stevens called the bill a \"robbery\" because it did not include sufficient provisions for land reform or protect the property of refugees given them by [[Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15|the military occupation of the South]].<ref name=Foner139>Foner (1980), pp. 139\u2013140</ref> Johnson vetoed the bill anyway, calling the Freedmen's Bureau unconstitutional, and decrying its cost: Congress had never purchased land, established schools, or provided financial help for \"our own people\".<ref>Foner, pp. 242\u2013247</ref><ref>Trefousse, pp. 180\u2013181</ref> Congress was unable to override Johnson's veto in February, but five months later passed a [[s:Index:Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill|similar bill]]. Stevens criticized the passage of the [[Southern Homestead Act of 1866]], arguing that the low-quality land it made available would not drive real economic growth for black families.<ref name=Foner139 />\n\nCongress overrode a Johnson veto to pass the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] (also introduced by Trumbull), granting African-Americans citizenship and equality before the law, and forbidding any action by a state to the contrary. Johnson made the gap between him and Congress wider when he accused Stevens, Sumner, and [[Wendell Phillips]] of trying to destroy the government.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 181\u2013186</ref>\n\nAfter Congress adjourned in July, the campaigning for the fall elections began.  Johnson embarked on a trip by rail, dubbed the \"[[Swing Around the Circle]]\", that won him few supporters; his arguments with hecklers were deemed undignified.  He attacked Stevens and other radicals during this tour. Stevens campaigned for firm measures against the South, his hand strengthened by violence in [[Memphis Riots of 1866|Memphis]] and [[New Orleans Riot|New Orleans]], where African-Americans and white Unionists had been attacked by mobs, including the police. Stevens was returned to Congress by his constituents; Republicans would have a two-thirds majority in both houses in the next Congress.<ref>Brodie, pp. 277\u2013289</ref>\n\n===Radical Reconstruction===\nIn January 1867, Stevens introduced [[Reconstruction Acts|legislation]] to divide the South into five districts, each commanded by an army general empowered to override civil authorities.  These military officers were to supervise elections with all males, of whatever race, entitled to vote, except for those who could not take an [[ironclad oath|oath of past loyalty]]\u2014most white Southerners could not. The states were to write new constitutions (subject to approval by Congress) and hold elections for state officials. Only if a state ratified the Fourteenth Amendment would its delegation be seated in Congress.<ref>Foner, pp. 273\u2013277</ref> The system gave power to a Republican coalition of freedmen (mobilized by the [[Union League]]), carpetbaggers, and co-operative Southerners (the last dubbed [[scalawag]]s by indignant ex-rebels) in most southern states.<ref>Foner, pp. 282\u2013283, 296\u2013299, 332\u2013333</ref> These states ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, which became part of the Constitution in mid-1868.<ref name=GPO>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/HMAN-112/html/HMAN-112-pg99.htm |title=Amendment XIV |publisher=US Government Printing Office |accessdate=June 23, 2013 |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202115456/http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/HMAN-112/html/HMAN-112-pg99.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nStevens introduced a [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], restricting Johnson from firing officials who had received Senate confirmation without getting that body's consent. The Tenure of Office Act was ambiguous, since it could be read to protect officeholders only during the tenure of the president who appointed them, and most of the officials the radicals sought to protect had been named by Lincoln. Chief among these was [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin Stanton]], a radical himself.<ref>Brodie, pp. 296\u2013303</ref>\n\nStevens steered a bill to enfranchise African-Americans in the District of Columbia through the House; the Senate passed it in 1867, and it was enacted over Johnson's veto. Congress was downsizing the Army for peacetime; Stevens offered an amendment, which became part of the bill as enacted, to have two regiments of African-American cavalry. His solicitude for African-Americans extended to the Native American; Stevens was successful in defeating a bill to place [[Indian reservation|reservations]] under state law, noting that the native people had often been abused by the states.<ref>Trefousse, p. 193</ref> An expansionist, he supported the railroads.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 194</ref> He added a stipulation into the [Transcontinental] Pacific Railroad Act requiring the applicable railroads to buy iron \"of American manufacture\" of the top price qualities.<ref>Ludwell Johnson \"Division and Reunion\" (New York: John Wiley, 1978), 110</ref> Although he sought to protect manufacturers with high tariffs, he also sought unsuccessfully to get a bill passed to protect labor with an eight-hour day in the District of Columbia.  Stevens advocated a bill to give government workers raises; it did not pass.<ref>Trefousse, p. 195</ref>\n\n==Impeaching the President==\n{{main|Impeachment of Andrew Johnson}}\nThe new [[40th Congress|Congress]], which convened on March 4, 1867, was not as aggressive in opposing Johnson as Stevens had hoped.  It soon adjourned until July, though its Judiciary Committee remained to hold hearings on whether the President should be impeached.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 210\u2013212</ref>  Stevens firmly supported impeachment, but others were less enthusiastic once the Senate elected Ohio's [[Benjamin Wade]] as its [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president ''pro tempore'']], next in line to the presidency in the absence of a vice president.  Wade was a radical who supported wealth redistribution; a speech of his in Kansas so impressed [[Karl Marx]] that he mentioned it in the first German edition of ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref>Foner, p. 309</ref> Also a supporter of women's suffrage, Wade was widely mistrusted for his views;<ref>Stewart, p. 39</ref> the prospect of his succession made some advocates of Johnson's removal more hesitant.  Stevens, however, strongly supported the removal of the President, and when the Judiciary Committee failed to report, tried to keep Congress in session until it did.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 217\u2013218</ref> Despite his opposition to its leader, Stevens worked with the administration on matters both supported; he obtained an appropriation for the [[purchase of Alaska]] and urged Secretary of State Seward to seek other territories to expand into.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 213\u2013214</ref>\n\nMost of Johnson's Cabinet supported him but Secretary of War Stanton did not, and with the [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]], war hero [[Ulysses S. Grant]], worked to undermine Johnson's Reconstruction policies.  Johnson obeyed the laws that Congress had passed, sometimes over his veto, though he often interpreted them in ways contrary to their intent.  After Stanton refused Johnson's request that he resign in August 1867, Johnson suspended Stanton, as permitted by the Tenure of Office Act, and made General Grant interim Secretary of War.<ref>Castel, pp. 136\u2013137</ref> Republicans campaigned in that year's election on the issue of African-American suffrage, but were met with a voter surge towards the Democrats, who opposed it.  Although no seats at Congress were directly at stake, voters in Ohio both defeated a referendum on black suffrage and elected the Democrats to the majority in [[Ohio General Assembly|the legislature]], meaning that Wade, whose term was due to expire in 1869, would not be reelected.<ref>Castel, pp. 146\u2013147</ref>\n\n[[File:TStevens-Johnson impeachment.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' woodcut of Stevens making his final argument to the House]]\nWhen Congress met again in December, although the Judiciary Committee voted 5\u20134 for impeachment, the House voted against it.<ref>Stewart, pp. 103\u2013111</ref> On January 13, 1868, the Senate overturned Johnson's suspension of Stanton.  Grant resigned as Secretary of War, and Stanton reclaimed his place.<ref>Castel, pp. 158\u2013159</ref> Nevertheless, on February 21, the President ousted Stanton from his position, appointing General [[Lorenzo Thomas]] in his place\u2014though Stanton barricaded himself in his office.<ref>Brodie, p. 334</ref><ref>Foner, p. 334</ref><!-- Yes, the same number! --> These actions caused great excitement in Washington, and in the House of Representatives, Stevens went from group to group on the floor, repeating, \"Didn't I tell you so?  What good did your moderation do you?  If you don't kill the beast, it will kill you.\"<ref>Trefousse, pp. 224\u2013225</ref> Stevens concluded the debate on a renewed impeachment resolution on February 24, though due to his poor health he was unable to complete his speech and gave it to the Clerk to read aloud.  He accused Johnson of usurping the powers of other branches of government, and of ignoring the will of the people.  He did not deny impeachment was a political matter, but \"this is not to be the temporary triumph of a political party, but is to endure in its consequence until the whole continent shall be filled with a free and untrammeled people or shall be a nest of shrinking, cowardly slaves.\"<ref>Trefousse, p. 225</ref><ref>Meltzer, p. 200</ref> The House voted 126\u201347 to impeach the President.<ref>Meltzer, p. 201</ref>\n\nStevens led the delegation of House members sent the following day to inform the Senate of the impeachment, though he had to be carried to its doors by his bearers. Elected to the committee charged with drafting articles of impeachment, his illness limited his involvement.  Nevertheless, dissatisfied with the committee's proposed articles, Stevens suggested another, that would become Article&nbsp;XI. This grounded the various accusations in statements Johnson had made denying the legitimacy of Congress due to the exclusion of the southern states, and stated that Johnson had tried to disobey the Reconstruction Acts. Stevens was one of the managers, or prosecutors, elected by the House to present its case in the impeachment trial.  Although Stevens was too ill to appear in the Senate on March 3, when the managers requested that Johnson be summoned (the President would appear only by his counsel, or defense managers), he was there ten days later when the summons was returnable. The ''[[New York Herald]]'' described him as  having a \"face of corpselike color, and rigidly twitching lips&nbsp;... a strange and unearthly apparition\u2014a reclused remonstrance from the tomb&nbsp;... the very embodiment of fanaticism, without a solitary leaven of justice or mercy&nbsp;... the avenging Nemesis of his party\u2014the sworn and implacable foe of the Executive of the nation\".<ref>Trefousse, pp. 226\u2013229</ref>\n\n[[File:Bingham-Stevens.jpg|thumb|left|Stevens (right) and [[John A. Bingham]] formally notify the Senate of Johnson's impeachment.  From ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.]]\nIncreasingly ill, Stevens took little part in the impeachment trial, at which the leading House manager was Massachusetts Representative [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]]. Stevens nourished himself on the Senate floor with raw eggs and [[Diamondback terrapin|terrapin]], port and brandy. He spoke only twice before making a closing argument for the House managers on April 27.  As he spoke, his voice weakened, and finally he allowed Butler to read the second half of his speech for him. Stevens focused on Article&nbsp;XI, taking the position that Johnson could be removed for political crimes; he need not have committed an offense against the law. The President, having sworn to faithfully execute the laws, had intentionally disobeyed the Tenure of Office Act after the Senate had refused to uphold his removal of Stanton, \"and now this offspring of assassination turns upon the Senate who have&nbsp;... rebuked him in a constitutional manner and bids them defiance. How can he escape the just vengeance of the law?\"<ref>Trefousse, pp. 231\u2013233</ref><ref>Stewart, pp. 233\u2013234</ref><!-- Again, the similar numbers in the parallel sources is a coincidence -->\n\nMost radicals were confident that Johnson would be convicted and removed from office.  Stevens, however, was never certain of the result as Chief Justice Chase (the former Treasury Secretary) made rulings that favored the defense, and he had no great confidence Republicans would stick together. On May 11, the Senate met in secret session, and senators gave speeches explaining how they intended to vote.  All Democrats were opposed, but an unexpectedly large number of Republicans also favored acquittal on some or all of the articles.  Counting votes, managers realized their best chance of gaining the required two-thirds for conviction was on the Stevens-inspired Article&nbsp;XI, and when the Senate assembled to give its verdict, they scheduled it to be voted upon first. The suspense was broken when Kansas Senator [[Edmund Ross]], whose position was uncertain, voted for acquittal.  This meant that, with the votes of those who remained, the President would not be convicted on that article.  The article failed, 35 in favor to 19 against. In the hope that delay would bring a different result, Republicans adjourned the Senate for ten days.  Stevens was carried from the Senate in his chair\u2014one observer described him as \"black with rage and disappointment\"\u2014and when those outside clamored for the result, Stevens shouted, \"The country is going to the devil!\"<ref>Stewart, pp. 275\u2013279</ref><ref>Trefousse, pp. 233\u2013234</ref>\n\n==Final months and death==\n[[File:Thaddeus Stevens Grave.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Stevens's grave in Lancaster]]\nDuring the recess of the impeachment court, the Republicans [[1868 Republican National Convention|met in convention]] in Chicago and nominated Grant for president.  Stevens did not attend, and was dismayed by the exclusion of African-American suffrage from the [[party platform]] as radical influence began to fade in the Republican Party.  When the Senate returned to session, it voted down Articles&nbsp;II and&nbsp;III by the same 35\u201319 margin as before, and Chase declared the President acquitted. Stevens did not give up on the idea of removing Johnson; in July, he proffered several more impeachment articles (the House refused to adopt them).<ref>Trefousse, pp. 234\u2013235</ref>  He offered a bill to divide Texas into several parts so as to gain additional Republican senators to vote out Johnson. It was defeated; the ''Herald'' stated, \"It is lamentable to see this old man, with one foot in the grave, pursuing the President with such vindictiveness.\"<ref>Brodie, pp. 356\u2013357</ref> Nevertheless, Stevens planned to revisit the question of impeachment when Congress met again in late 1868.<ref>Trefousse, p. 235</ref>\n\nBrodie suggested that Stevens's hatred of Johnson was the only thing keeping him from despair, aware as he was of the continued violence in the South, some of which was committed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].  Several of the southern states had been re-admitted by this time, and the murders and intimidation were aiding the Democrats there in restoring white rule. With the Republicans unwilling to embrace black suffrage in their platform and the Democrats opposed to it, Stevens feared Democratic victory in the 1868 elections might even bring back slavery. He told his fellow Pennsylvania politician, [[Alexander McClure]], \"My life has been a failure.  With all this great struggle of years in Washington, and the fearful sacrifice of life and treasure, I see little hope for the Republic.\", He took pride, he continued, in his role in establishing free public education in Pennsylvania.<ref>Brodie, pp. 361\u2013363</ref> When interviewed by a reporter seeking to gain his life story, Stevens replied, \"I have no history. My life-long regret is that I have lived so long and so uselessly.\"<ref>Brodie, p. 363</ref> Nevertheless, in his last formal speech to the House, Stevens stated that \"man still is vile.  But such large steps have lately been taken in the true direction, that the patriot has a right to take courage.\"<ref>Brodie, p. 364</ref>\n\n{{quote box | align = right | width = 24em | salign = right\n| quote = <poem>\nI repose in this quiet and secluded spot\nNot from any natural preference for solitude\nBut, finding other Cemeteries limited as to Race\n:by Charter Rules\nI have chosen this that I might illustrate\n:in my death\nThe Principles which I advocated\n:through a long life;\nEQUALITY OF MAN BEFORE HIS CREATOR<ref>Brodie, p. 366</ref></poem>\n| source =\u2014The inscription on Stevens's grave}}\n\nWhen Congress adjourned in late July, Stevens remained in Washington, too ill to return to Pennsylvania.  Stevens was in pain from his stomach ailments, from swollen feet, and from [[dropsy]]. By early August, he was unable to leave the house. He still received some visitors though, and correctly predicted to his friend and former student Simon Stevens (no relation) that Grant would win the election. On the afternoon of August 11, his doctor warned that he would probably not last through the night.  His longtime housekeeper and companion, Lydia Hamilton Smith, his nephew Thaddeus, and friends gathered by him.  Two black preachers came to pray by him, telling him that he had the prayers of all their people.  He sucked on ice to try to soothe the pain; his last words were a request for more of it.  Thaddeus Stevens died on the night of August 11, 1868, as the old day departed.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 240\u2013241</ref>\n\nPresident Johnson issued no statement upon the death of his enemy.<ref name = \"M218\">Meltzer, p. 218</ref> Newspaper reaction was generally along partisan lines, though sometimes mixed.

Early biographical works on Stevens were composed by men who knew him, and reflected their viewpoints. Biographies at the turn of the twentieth century, such as those by [[Samuel McCall]] in 1899 and by James Albert Woodburn in 1913, presented Stevens favorably, as a sincere man, motivated by principle.<ref>Berlin, pp. 153\u2013154</ref> Early African-American historian [[W.

These historians, led by [[William Dunning]], taught that Reconstruction had been an opportunity for radical politicians, motivated by ill-will towards the South, to destroy what little of southern life and dignity the war had left.<ref name = \"B154\">Berlin, p. 154</ref><ref>Brodie, p. 370</ref><ref name = \"Castel\">Castel, pp. 220\u2013221</ref> Dunning himself deemed Stevens \"truculent, vindictive, and cynical\".<ref name = \"B154\" /> [[Lloyd Paul Stryker]], who wrote a highly favorable 1929 biography of Johnson, labeled Stevens as a \"horrible old man&nbsp;... craftily preparing to strangle the bleeding, broken body of the South\" and who thought it would be \"a beautiful thing\" to see \"the white men, especially the white women of the South, writhing under negro domination.\"<ref name = \"Castel\" /><ref>Brodie, pp. 369\u2013370</ref> In 1915, [[D.

''The Epic of America''. Boston: Little, Brown, 1931. p. 275.</ref> \n\nHistorians who penned biographies of Stevens in the late 1930s sought to move away from this perspective, seeking to rehabilitate him and his political career. Thomas F. Woodley, writing in 1937, shows admiration of Stevens, but he attributed Stevens's driving force to bitterness over his clubfoot. Alphonse Miller, in his 1939 biography, found that the former congressman was motivated by a desire for justice. Both men were convinced that recent books had not treated him fairly.  Richard Current's 1942 work reflected current [[Beardian]] historiography, which saw all American history, including Reconstruction, as a three-way economic struggle between the industrialists of the Northeast (represented by Stevens), the planters of the South, and the farmers of the Midwest. Current argued that Stevens was motivated in his Reconstruction policies by frustrated ambitions and a desire to use his political position to promote industrial capitalism and advance the Republican Party. He concluded that despite Stevens's egalitarian beliefs, he actually promoted inequality, for \"none had done more than he to bring on the age of Big Business, with its concentration of wealth.\"<ref>Berlin, pp. 155\u2013157</ref>\n\nWith Ralph Korngold's 1955 biography of Stevens, the [[neoabolitionism|neoabolitionist]] school of historians began to consider the former congressman. These professors rejected the earlier view that those who had gone South to aid the African-American after the war were \"rapscallion carpetbaggers\" defeated by \"saintly redeemers\". Instead, they applauded those who had sought to end slavery and forward civil rights, and castigated Johnson for obstructionism. They took the view that the African-American was central to Reconstruction, and the only things wrong with the congressional program were that it did not go far enough and that it stopped too soon.  Brodie's 1959 biography of Stevens was of this school. Controversial in its conclusions for being a [[psychobiography]], it found that Stevens was a \"consummate underdog who identified with the oppressed\" and whose intelligence won him success, while his consciousness of his clubfoot retarded his social development.<ref>Berlin, p. 157</ref><ref>Castel, pp. 222, 225</ref> According to Brodie, this also made him unwilling to marry a woman of his own social standing.<ref>Andreasen, pp. 76\u201377</ref>\n\nScholars who followed Brodie continued to chip away at the idea of Stevens as a vindictive dictator, who dominated Congress to get his way. In 1960, [[Eric McKitrick]] deemed Stevens \"a picturesque and adroit politician, but a very limited one\" whose career was \"a long comic sequence of devilish schemes which, one after another, kept blowing up in his face.\"<ref>Andreasen, p. 79</ref> From the mid-1970s onward, Foner argued that Stevens's role was in staking out radical position, but events, not Stevens, caused the Republicans to support him. [[Michael Les Benedict]] in 1974 suggested that Stevens's reputation as a dictator was based more on his personality than on his influence. In 1989, Allan Bogue found that as chairman of Ways and Means, Stevens was \"less than complete master\" of his committee.<ref>Andreasen, pp. 79\u201380</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Hans Trefousse]] stated in a 1969 study of the Radical Republicans that Stevens's \"one abiding passion was equality\".<ref>Andreasen, p. 75</ref> In 1991, he noted that Stevens \"was one of the most influential representatives ever to serve in Congress. [He dominated] the House with his wit, knowledge of parliamentary law, and sheer willpower, even though he was often unable to prevail.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Hans L.
