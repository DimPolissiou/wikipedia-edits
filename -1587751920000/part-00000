The series narrative follows [[Buffy Summers]] (played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), the latest in a line of young women known as \"Vampire Slayers\", or simply \"[[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]]s\". In the story, Slayers, or the \u201dChosen Ones\u201d, are \"called\" (chosen by [[destiny|fate]]) to battle against [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], [[demon]]s, and other forces of darkness. Buffy wants to live a normal life, but as the series progresses, she learns to embrace her destiny. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who guides, teaches, and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the \"Scooby Gang\".\n\nThe series received critical and popular acclaim, frequently being listed as one of the greatest TV shows of all time,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-tv-shows-of-all-time-2017-6#buffy-the-vampire-slayer-1997-to-2003-12|title=50 TV shows everyone should watch in their lifetime|work=INSIDER|first=Jacob|last=Shamsian|date=March 8, 2018|access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\">{{cite web |author=Wahoske, Matthew J. |url=http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043137/http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |title=Nielsen Ratings For Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, And Firefly |work=Insightbb.com}}</ref> Although such [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] are lower than successful shows on the \"big four\" networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2001/fcc01133.txt |title=The Dual Network Rule |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=May 15, 2001 |quote=[T]he four major broadcast networks are unique among the media in their ability to reach a wide audience}}</ref> they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf#search=%22%20Dawson's%20Creek%2C%20Buffy%20is%20often%20associated%20with%20the%20early%20success%20of%20the%20Warner%20Brothers%20Network.%22 |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=March 9, 2005 |quote=Mr. Levin was a key player in establishing The WB's distinct brand and youth appeal through programming such as ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', ''[[Everwood]]'', and ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' was almost entirely ignored by major award shows during its run, the series was nominated for the [[American Film Institute Awards 2001|American Film Institute Award for Drama Series of the Year]], Gellar was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama]] for her performance in the show, and the series was nominated five times for [[TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Awards]], winning once in 2003 for the [[19th TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Heritage Award]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-20-years-later-emmys/ |title=\u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019: 20 years later, it still remains Emmy\u2019s biggest snub |website=Gold Derby |first=Ralph |last=Galvan |date=March 10, 2017 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2002/09/10/five-reasons-buffy-gets-snubbed-emmys/ |title=Five reasons ''Buffy'' gets snubbed by the Emmys |website=Entertainment Weekly |first=Ken |last=Tucker |date=September 10, 2002 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/biggest-emmys-snubs-all-time/ |title=14 Jaw-Dropping Emmys Snubs We're Still Not Over |website=TV Guide |first=Kaitlin |last=Thomas |date=September 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Buffy'' has led to hundreds of tie-in products, including [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|novels]], [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|comics]], and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|video games]].

Giles, rarely referred to by his first name (it is later revealed that in his rebellious younger days he went by \"Ripper\"), is a member of the [[Watchers' Council]], whose job is to train and guide the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offers insights into their origins and advice on how to defeat them, and helps her train to stay in fighting form.\n\nBuffy is also helped by friends she meets at Sunnydale High: [[Willow Rosenberg]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) and [[Xander Harris]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]). Willow is originally a [[Wallflower (people)|wallflower]] who excels at academics, providing a contrast to Buffy's outgoing personality and less-than-stellar educational record. They share the social isolation that comes with being different, and especially from being exceptional young women. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character and a powerful witch, and [[coming out|comes out]] as a [[lesbian]]. In contrast, Xander, with no supernatural abilities, provides [[comic relief]] and a grounded perspective. It is Xander who often provides the heart to the series, and in season six, becomes the hero in place of Buffy who defeats the \"[[Big Bad]]\". Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes; Xander is missing in [[Conversations with Dead People|only one]].\n\nThe cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, [[Joyce Summers]] (portrayed by [[Kristine Sutherland]]), who functions as an anchor of normality in the Summers' lives even after she learns of Buffy's role in the supernatural world (\"[[Becoming, Part Two]]\"). Buffy's younger sister [[Dawn Summers]] ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) is introduced in season five (\"[[Buffy vs. Dracula]]\"). A vampire tortured with a soul in return for horrific deeds committed in the past to many, including a young gypsy girl and her family, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] (portrayed by [[David Boreanaz]]), is Buffy's love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy after realizing he will never be able to give her a normal life. He goes on to make amends for his sins and to search for redemption in his own spin-off, ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. He makes several guest appearances in the remaining seasons, including the last episode.\n\nAt Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students besides Willow and Xander willing to join her fight for good, an informal group eventually tagged the \"Scooby Gang\" or \"Scoobies\". [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved. [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]] ([[Seth Green]]), a fellow student, rock guitarist and werewolf, joins the group through his relationship with Willow. [[Jenny Calendar]] ([[Robia LaMorte]]), Sunnydale's computer science teacher, joins the group after helping destroy a demon trapped in cyberspace during season 1. She later becomes Giles' love interest. [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] ([[Emma Caulfield]]), a former vengeance demon (Anyanka) who specialized in avenging scorned women, becomes Xander's lover after losing her powers and joins the group in season four.\n\nIn Buffy's senior year at high school, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]), the other current Slayer, who was \"called\" forth when Slayer [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra Young]] ([[Bianca Lawson]]) was killed by vampire [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] ([[Juliet Landau]]), in season two. Although Faith initially fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the group, she comes to stand against them and sides with [[Richard Wilkins (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]] ([[Harry Groener]]) after accidentally killing a human in season three. She reappears briefly in the fourth season, looking for vengeance, and moves to ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' where she voluntarily goes to jail for her murders. Faith reappears in season seven of ''Buffy'', after having helped Angel and his crew, and fights alongside Buffy against The First Evil.\n\nBuffy gathers other allies: [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus (Angel) and one of Buffy's major enemies in early seasons, although they later become allies and lovers. At the end of season six, Spike regains his soul. Spike is known for his [[Billy Idol]]-style [[peroxide blond]] hair and his black leather coat, stolen from a previous Slayer, [[Nikki Wood]]; her son, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]] ([[D. B. Woodside]]), joins the group in the final season. [[Tara Maclay]] ([[Amber Benson]]) is a fellow member of Willow's [[Wicca]] group during season four, and their friendship eventually turns into a romantic relationship. Buffy becomes involved personally and professionally with [[Riley Finn]] ([[Marc Blucas]]), a military operative in \"the Initiative\", which hunts demons using science and technology. The final season sees [[geek]]y wannabe-villain [[Andrew Wells]] ([[Tom Lenk]]) come to side with the Scoobies after initially being their captive/hostage; they regard him more as a nuisance than an ally.\n\n''Buffy'' featured dozens of recurring characters, both major and minor. For example, the \"Big Bad\" (villain) characters were featured for at least one season (for example, [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]] is a character who appeared in 12 episodes, spanning much of season five). Similarly, characters who allied themselves to the group and characters who attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.\n\n===Setting and filming locations===\n{{Main|Sunnydale}}\n[[File:Torrance High School.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Torrance High School]] was used for the fictional Sunnydale High School.]]\nThe show is set in the fictional California town of Sunnydale, whose suburban [[Sunnydale High|Sunnydale High School]] sits on top of a \"Hellmouth\", a gateway to demon realms. The Hellmouth, located beneath the school library, is a source of mystical energies as well as a [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena. In addition to being an open-ended plot device, Joss Whedon has cited the Hellmouth and \"[[High school (North America)|High school]] as [[Hell]]\" as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series.<ref>Yovanovich, Linda, \"Young Blood\", ''Smgfan.com'', originally from ''OnSat'' (July 14, 1997), Whedon said: \"[High school as hell] was always the basis of the show. When they said, 'Do you want to turn it into a show?' The character was not enough alone to sustain it. But you know when I thought of the idea of the horror movies as a metaphor for high school, [I said] okay this is something that will work week to week.\"</ref>\n\nMost of ''Buffy'' was shot on location in [[Los Angeles, California]].

While the show is mainly a [[drama]] with frequent [[comic relief]], most episodes blend different [[genre]]s, including [[horror film|horror]], [[martial arts]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[melodrama]], [[farce]], [[science fiction]], [[Screwball comedy film|comedy]], and even, in [[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|one episode]], [[musical comedy]].\n\nThe series' narrative revolves around Buffy and her friends, collectively dubbed the \"Scooby Gang\", who struggle to balance the fight against [[supernatural]] evils with their complex social lives.<ref name=\"FtF-Intro\" /> The show mixes complex, season-long storylines with a [[Villain of the week|villain-of-the-week]] format; a typical episode contains one or more [[villain]]s, or supernatural phenomena, that are thwarted or defeated by the end of the episode. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[hero]]ine. Gellar described the show as \"the ultimate metaphor: horrors of adolescence manifesting through these actual monsters.

[[Buffy Summers]] has just moved to [[Sunnydale]] after burning down her old school's gym, and hopes to escape her Slayer duties. Her plans are complicated by [[Rupert Giles]], her new [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. Sunnydale High is built atop a Hellmouth, a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area. Buffy befriends two schoolmates, [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]], who help her fight evil throughout the series, but they must first prevent [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]], an ancient and especially threatening vampire, from opening the Hellmouth and taking over Sunnydale.\n\nThe emotional stakes are raised in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 2)|season two]]. Vampires [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] and [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] (weakened from a mob in [[Prague]], which, it is implied, caused her debilitating injury), come to town along with a new slayer, [[Kendra Young]], who was activated as a result of Buffy's brief death in the [[Prophecy Girl|season one finale]]. Xander becomes involved with [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]], while Willow becomes involved with witchcraft and [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]], who is a werewolf. The romantic relationship between Buffy and the vampire [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] develops over the course of the season, but after they have sex, Angel's soul, given to him by a Gypsy curse in the past, is lost, and he once more becomes Angelus, a sadistic killer. Kendra is killed by a restored Drusilla. Angelus torments much of the \"Scooby Gang\" throughout the rest of the season and murders multiple innocents and Giles' new girlfriend [[Jenny Calendar]], a [[Romani people|gypsy]] who was sent to maintain Angel's curse. To avert an apocalypse, Buffy is forced to banish Angel to a demon dimension just moments after Willow has restored his soul. The ordeal leaves Buffy emotionally shattered, and she leaves Sunnydale.\n\nAfter attempting to start a new life in Los Angeles, Buffy returns to town in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 3)|season three]]. Angel has mysteriously been released from the demon dimension, but is close to insanity due to the torment he suffered there, and is nearly driven to [[suicide]] by the [[First Evil]]. He and Buffy realize that a relationship between them can never happen; he eventually leaves Sunnydale at the end of the season. A new watcher named Wesley is put in Giles' place when Giles is fired from the Watcher's Council because he has developed a \"father's love\" for Buffy; and towards the end of the season, Buffy announces that she will no longer be working for the Council. Early in the season, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]], the Slayer activated after Kendra's death. She also encounters the affable [[Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]], who secretly has plans to \"ascend\" (become a \"pure\" demon) on Sunnydale High's Graduation Day. Although Faith initially works well with Buffy, she becomes increasingly unstable after accidentally killing a human and forms a relationship with the paternal yet manipulative Mayor, eventually landing in a coma after a fight with Buffy. At the end of the season, after the Mayor becomes a huge snake-like demon, Buffy and the entire graduating class destroy him by blowing up Sunnydale High.\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4)|Season four]] sees Buffy and Willow enroll at [[University of California|UC]] Sunnydale, while Xander joins the workforce and begins dating [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]], a former vengeance demon. Spike returns as a series regular and is abducted by The Initiative, a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. They implant a [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] in his head that punishes him whenever he tries to harm a human. He makes a truce with the Scooby Gang and begins to fight on their side, purely for the joy of fighting, upon learning that he can still harm other demons. Oz leaves town after realizing that he is too dangerous as a werewolf, and Willow falls in love with [[Tara Maclay]], another witch. Buffy begins dating [[Riley Finn]], a graduate student and member of The Initiative. Although appearing to be a well-meaning anti-demon operation, The Initiative's sinister plans are revealed when [[Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Adam]], a monster secretly built from parts of humans, demons and machinery, escapes and begins to wreak havoc on the town. Adam is destroyed by a magical composite of Buffy and her three friends, and The Initiative is shut down.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5)|season five]], a younger sister, [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], suddenly appears in Buffy's life; although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there. Buffy is confronted by [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]], an exiled Hell God who is searching for a [[The Key (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|\"Key\"]] that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension and in the process blur the lines between dimensions and unleash Hell on Earth. It is later discovered that the Key's protectors have used Buffy's blood to turn the Key into human form \u2013 Dawn \u2013 concurrently implanting everybody with lifelong memories of her. The Watcher's Council aids in Buffy's research on Glory, and she and Giles are both reinstated on their own terms. Riley leaves early in the season after realizing that Buffy does not love him and joins a military demon-hunting operation. Spike, still implanted with the Initiative chip, realizes he is in love with Buffy and increasingly helps the Scoobies in their fight. Buffy's mother [[Joyce Summers|Joyce]] dies of a brain [[aneurysm]], while at the end of the season, Xander proposes to Anya. Glory finally discovers that Dawn is the key and kidnaps her, using Dawn's blood to open a portal to the Hell dimension. To save Dawn, Buffy sacrifices her own life by diving into the portal and thus closes it with her death.\n\nAt the beginning of [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 6)|season six]], Buffy has been dead for 147 days, but Buffy's friends resurrect her through a powerful spell, believing they have rescued her from a Hell dimension. Buffy returns in a deep depression, explaining (several episodes later) that she had been in [[Heaven]] and is devastated to be pulled back to Earth. Giles returns to England because he has concluded that Buffy has become too reliant on him, while Buffy takes up a fast-food job to support herself and Dawn, and develops a secret, mutually abusive sexual relationship with Spike. Dawn suffers from [[kleptomania]] and feelings of alienation, Xander leaves Anya at the altar (after which she once again becomes a vengeance demon), and Willow becomes addicted to magic, causing Tara to temporarily leave her. They also begin to deal with [[Trio (Buffyverse)|The Trio]], a group of [[nerd]]s led by [[Warren Mears]] who use their proficiency in technology and magic to attempt to kill Buffy and take over Sunnydale. Warren is shown to be the only competent villain of the group and, after Buffy thwarts his plans multiple times and the Trio breaks apart, he becomes unhinged and attacks Buffy with a gun, accidentally killing Tara in the process. This causes Willow to descend into nihilistic darkness and unleash all of her dark magical powers, killing Warren and attempting to kill his friends. Giles returns to face her in battle and infuses her with light magic, tapping into her remaining humanity. This overwhelms Willow with guilt and pain, whereupon she attempts to destroy the world to end everyone's suffering, although it eventually allows Xander to reach through her pain and end her rampage. Late in the season, after losing control and trying to rape Buffy, Spike leaves Sunnydale and travels to see a demon and asks him to \"return him to what he used to be\" so that he can \"give Buffy what she deserves\". After Spike passes a series of brutal tests, the demon restores his soul.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7)|season seven]], it is revealed that Buffy's second resurrection caused instability that is allowing the First Evil to begin tipping the balance between good and evil. It begins by hunting down and killing inactive [[Potential Slayers]], and soon raises an army of ancient, powerful [[Turok-Han]] vampires. After the Watchers' Council is destroyed, a number of Potential Slayers (some brought by Giles) take refuge in Buffy's house. Faith returns to help fight The First Evil, and the new Sunnydale High School's principal, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]], also joins the cause. The Turok-Han vampires and a sinister, [[misogyny|misogynistic]] preacher known as [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]] begin causing havoc for the Scoobies. As the Hellmouth becomes more active, nearly all of Sunnydale's population \u2013 humans and demons alike \u2013 flee. In the series finale, Buffy kills Caleb, and Angel returns to Sunnydale with an amulet, which Buffy gives to Spike; the Scoobies then surround the Hellmouth and the Potential Slayers descend into its cavern, while Willow casts a spell that activates their Slayer powers. Anya dies in the fight, as do some of the new Slayers. Spike's amulet channels the power of the sun to destroy the Hellmouth and all the vampires within it, including himself. The collapse of the cavern creates a crater that swallows all of Sunnydale, while the survivors of the battle escape in a [[school bus]]. In the final scene, as the survivors survey the crater, Dawn asks, \"What are we going to do now?\" Buffy slowly begins to enigmatically smile as she contemplates the future ahead of her, ending the series on a hopeful note.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Joss Whedon by Gage Skidmore 8.jpg|200px|thumb|''Buffy'' creator Joss Whedon also served as executive producer, head writer, and director on the series.]]\nWriter [[Joss Whedon]] says that \"Rhonda the Immortal Waitress\" was really the first incarnation of the ''Buffy'' concept, \"the idea of some woman who seems to be completely insignificant who turns out to be extraordinary\".<ref>{{cite AV media |title=''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'': Television with a Bite |people=Jack Walworth (Director), [[Bill Mumy]] (Narrator) |series=[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]] |via=''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 6)#DVD release|Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 6)]]'' DVD set, disc 6 ([[DVD region code|region 1]] release: May 25, 2004) |date=May 14, 2003 |minutes=2:15 |publisher=[[A&E Network]]}}</ref> This early, unproduced idea evolved into ''Buffy'', which Whedon developed to invert the Hollywood formula of \"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every [[horror film|horror movie]]\".<ref name=blondegirl>{{cite book |last=Billson |first=Anne |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |date=December 5, 2005 |pages=24\u201325|title-link=Buffy the Vampire Slayer (BFI TV Classics) }}</ref> Whedon wanted \"to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero\".<ref name=blondegirl /> He explained, \"The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Gottlieb |first=Allie |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.26.02/buffy1-0239.html |title=Buffy's Angels |publisher=Metroactive.com |date=September 26, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe idea was first visited through Whedon's script for the 1992 movie ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', which featured [[Kristy Swanson]] in the title role.

Then the episode's story was \"broken\" into acts and scenes. Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode following the [[television advertisement|commercial break]]. The writers collectively filled in scenes surrounding these act breaks for a more fleshed-out story. A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene. Once \"breaking\" was done, the credited author wrote an outline for the episode, which was checked by Whedon or Noxon. The writer then wrote a full script, which went through a series of drafts, and finally a quick rewrite from the showrunner. The final article was used as the shooting script.\n\n===Broadcast history and syndication===\n[[File:UPN Promo Buffy Season 6.jpg|thumb|upright|UPN took great advantage promoting the network switch by teasing fans of Buffy's resurrection from The WB's series finale.]]\n''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' first aired on March 10, 1997, (as a mid season replacement for the show ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'') on the [[The WB Television Network|WB network]], and played a key role in the growth of the [[Warner Bros.]] television network in its early years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kff.org |date=March 9, 2005 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Schneider, Michael |author2=Adalian, Josef |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |title=WB revisits glory days |work=Variety |date=June 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218025029/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |archivedate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> After five seasons, it transferred to the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]) for its final two seasons.

Hannigan figured Willow would be happy and proud that she got \"most of it\" back.

The series was created by ''Buffy'''s creator [[Joss Whedon]] in collaboration with [[David Greenwalt]]. Like ''Buffy'', it was produced by the production company [[Mutant Enemy Productions|Mutant Enemy]]. At times, it performed better in the [[Nielsen ratings]] than its parent series did.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\"/>\n\nThe series was given a darker tone, focusing on the ongoing trials of Angel in Los Angeles. His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul, punishment for more than a century of murder and torture. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a [[private detective]] in a fictionalized version of [[Los Angeles, California]], where he and his associates work to \"help the helpless\", to restore the faith and \"save the souls\" of those who have lost their way. Typically, this mission involves doing battle with demons or demonically allied humans (primarily the law firm Wolfram & Hart), while Angel must also contend with his own violent nature. In season five, the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel, giving him control of their Los Angeles office. Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside.\n\nIn addition to Boreanaz, ''Angel'' inherited ''Buffy'' series cast regular [[Charisma Carpenter]] ([[Cordelia Chase]]). When [[Glenn Quinn]] ([[Doyle (Angel)|Doyle]]) left the series during its first season, [[Alexis Denisof]] ([[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]]), who played a recurring character in the last nine episodes of season three of ''Buffy'', took his place. Carpenter and Denisof were followed later by [[Mercedes McNab]] ([[Harmony Kendall]]) and [[James Marsters]] ([[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]). Several actors and actresses who played ''Buffy'' characters made guest appearances on ''Angel'', including [[Seth Green]] ([[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]]), [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] ([[Buffy Summers]]), [[Eliza Dushku]] ([[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]]), [[Tom Lenk]] ([[Andrew Wells]]), [[Alyson Hannigan]] ([[Willow Rosenberg]]), [[Julie Benz]] ([[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]]), [[Mark Metcalf]] ([[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]]), [[Julia Lee (actress)|Julia Lee]] ([[Anne Steele (Buffyverse)|Anne Steele]]) and [[Juliet Landau]] ([[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]]). Angel also continued to appear occasionally on ''Buffy''.\n\nOther actors that appeared in both the ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Angel'' series but as different characters include: Bob Fimiani as Mr. Ward, a head of the Department of Defense in ''Buffy'' and Glith-roo, a Codger Demon in ''Angel''; [[Carlos Jacott]] as a demon named Ken in ''Buffy'' and a different demon named Richard Stanley in ''Angel''; [[Jonathan M. Woodward]] as a vampire and former classmate in ''Buffy'' named Holden Webster and Knox, a Wolfram and Heart scientist in ''Angel''; and [[Andy Umberger]] who played a demon name D'Hoffryn in ''Buffy'' and predator named Ronald Meltzer in ''Angel''.\n\nThe storyline has been continued in the comic book series ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'' published by [[IDW Publishing]] and later ''[[Angel and Faith]]'' published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].\n\n===Expanded universe===\n{{Main|Buffyverse canon|Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|List of Buffyverse comics}}\n[[File:Long way home tpb.jpg|thumb|upright|Trade paperback cover of ''Buffy: Season Eight'' [[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|Volume One]], written by Joss Whedon.]]\nOutside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called \"Buffyverse [[Expanded Universe]]\".

Following the publication of ''[[Tales of the Vampires]]'' in 2004, ''Dark Horse Comics'' halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company produced Whedon's ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'' with forty issues from March 2007 to January 2011, picking up where the television show left off\u2014taking the place of an eighth [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] season.<ref name=\"ew-firstlook\"/> The first story arc is also written by Whedon, and is called \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" which has been widely well-received, with circulation rivaling industry leaders [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] top-selling titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comicsbeat.com/dc-comics-month-to-month-sales-april-2007/ |title=DC Comics Month-to-month Sales: April 2007 |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |publisher=The Beat}}</ref> Also after \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" came other story arcs like Faith's return in \"[[No Future for You]]\" and a ''Fray'' cross-over in \"[[Time of Your Life (Buffy comic)|Time of Your Life]]\". Dark Horse later followed ''Season Eight'' with ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]'', starting in 2011, and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten]]'', which began in 2014. Dark Horse continued to publish ''Buffy'' comics continuing the story after the television show until September 2018 when they released the final issue of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve]]'' which intended to bring closure to the series. Following the end of Dark Horse's ''Buffy'' series, [[Boom! Studios]] acquired the license to publish ''Buffy'' comics. Taking a different approach from Dark Horse, Boom! Studios decided to publish a new rebooted ''Buffy'' series in 2019 with many elements updated to be more contemporary. Boom!

[[20th Century Fox Television|20th Century Fox]] showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three-minute pilot was completed in 2004 but was never picked up.

[[UPN]] in 2001, viewing figures had fallen. The series' high came during the third season, with 5.3 million viewers (including repeats). This was probably due to the fact that both Gellar and Hannigan had hit movies out during the season (''[[Cruel Intentions]]'' and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' respectively). The series' low was in season one at 3.7 million. The show's series finale \"[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]\" pulled in a season high of 4.9&nbsp;million viewers on the UPN network.<ref name=\"s7 ratings\">{{cite web |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |title='Buffy' Finale Stakes Strong Ratings for UPN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030524173301/http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |archivedate=May 24, 2003 |date=May 21, 2003 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |publisher=Zap2it}}</ref>\n\n''Buffy'' did not compete with shows on the main four networks ([[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), but The WB was impressed with the young audience that the show was bringing in. Because of this, The WB ordered a full season of 22 episodes for the series' second season. Beginning with the episode \"[[Innocence (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Innocence]]\", which was watched by 8.2&nbsp;million people, ''Buffy'' was moved from Monday at 9:00&nbsp;pm to launch The WB's new night of programming on Tuesday. Due to its large success in that time slot, it remained on Tuesdays at 8:00&nbsp;pm for the remainder of its original run. With its new timeslot on The WB, the show quickly climbed to the top of The WB ratings and became one of their highest-rated shows for the remainder of its time on the network. The show always placed in the top 3, usually only coming in behind ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''. Between seasons three and five, ''Buffy'' flip-flopped with ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Charmed]]'' as the network's second highest-rated show.\n\nIn the 2001\u20132002 season, the show had moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB. While it was still one of the highest rated shows on their network, The WB felt that the show had already peaked and was not worth giving a salary increase to the cast and crew. UPN on the other hand had strong faith in the series and picked it up for a two-season renewal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title='Buffy' picks up stakes, leaves WB for UPN |publisher=CNN |date=April 23, 2001 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211104047/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM%3ASHOWBIZ |archivedate=December 11, 2011}}</ref> UPN dedicated a two-hour premiere to the series to help re-launch it.

The series narrative follows [[Buffy Summers]] (played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), the latest in a line of young women known as \"Vampire Slayers\", or simply \"[[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]]s\". In the story, Slayers, or the \u201dChosen Ones\u201d, are \"called\" (chosen by [[destiny|fate]]) to battle against [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], [[demon]]s, and other forces of darkness. Buffy wants to live a normal life, but as the series progresses, she learns to embrace her destiny. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who guides, teaches, and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the \"Scooby Gang\".\n\nThe series received critical and popular acclaim, frequently being listed as one of the greatest TV shows of all time,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-tv-shows-of-all-time-2017-6#buffy-the-vampire-slayer-1997-to-2003-12|title=50 TV shows everyone should watch in their lifetime|work=INSIDER|first=Jacob|last=Shamsian|date=March 8, 2018|access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\">{{cite web |author=Wahoske, Matthew J. |url=http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043137/http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |title=Nielsen Ratings For Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, And Firefly |work=Insightbb.com}}</ref> Although such [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] are lower than successful shows on the \"big four\" networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2001/fcc01133.txt |title=The Dual Network Rule |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=May 15, 2001 |quote=[T]he four major broadcast networks are unique among the media in their ability to reach a wide audience}}</ref> they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf#search=%22%20Dawson's%20Creek%2C%20Buffy%20is%20often%20associated%20with%20the%20early%20success%20of%20the%20Warner%20Brothers%20Network.%22 |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=March 9, 2005 |quote=Mr. Levin was a key player in establishing The WB's distinct brand and youth appeal through programming such as ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', ''[[Everwood]]'', and ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' was almost entirely ignored by major award shows during its run, the series was nominated for the [[American Film Institute Awards 2001|American Film Institute Award for Drama Series of the Year]], Gellar was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama]] for her performance in the show, and the series was nominated five times for [[TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Awards]], winning once in 2003 for the [[19th TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Heritage Award]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-20-years-later-emmys/ |title=\u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019: 20 years later, it still remains Emmy\u2019s biggest snub |website=Gold Derby |first=Ralph |last=Galvan |date=March 10, 2017 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2002/09/10/five-reasons-buffy-gets-snubbed-emmys/ |title=Five reasons ''Buffy'' gets snubbed by the Emmys |website=Entertainment Weekly |first=Ken |last=Tucker |date=September 10, 2002 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/biggest-emmys-snubs-all-time/ |title=14 Jaw-Dropping Emmys Snubs We're Still Not Over |website=TV Guide |first=Kaitlin |last=Thomas |date=September 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Buffy'' has led to hundreds of tie-in products, including [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|novels]], [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|comics]], and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|video games]].

Giles, rarely referred to by his first name (it is later revealed that in his rebellious younger days he went by \"Ripper\"), is a member of the [[Watchers' Council]], whose job is to train and guide the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offers insights into their origins and advice on how to defeat them, and helps her train to stay in fighting form.\n\nBuffy is also helped by friends she meets at Sunnydale High: [[Willow Rosenberg]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) and [[Xander Harris]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]). Willow is originally a [[Wallflower (people)|wallflower]] who excels at academics, providing a contrast to Buffy's outgoing personality and less-than-stellar educational record. They share the social isolation that comes with being different, and especially from being exceptional young women. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character and a powerful witch, and [[coming out|comes out]] as a [[lesbian]]. In contrast, Xander, with no supernatural abilities, provides [[comic relief]] and a grounded perspective. It is Xander who often provides the heart to the series, and in season six, becomes the hero in place of Buffy who defeats the \"[[Big Bad]]\". Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes; Xander is missing in [[Conversations with Dead People|only one]].\n\nThe cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, [[Joyce Summers]] (portrayed by [[Kristine Sutherland]]), who functions as an anchor of normality in the Summers' lives even after she learns of Buffy's role in the supernatural world (\"[[Becoming, Part Two]]\"). Buffy's younger sister [[Dawn Summers]] ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) is introduced in season five (\"[[Buffy vs. Dracula]]\"). A vampire tortured with a soul in return for horrific deeds committed in the past to many, including a young gypsy girl and her family, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] (portrayed by [[David Boreanaz]]), is Buffy's love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy after realizing he will never be able to give her a normal life. He goes on to make amends for his sins and to search for redemption in his own spin-off, ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. He makes several guest appearances in the remaining seasons, including the last episode.\n\nAt Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students besides Willow and Xander willing to join her fight for good, an informal group eventually tagged the \"Scooby Gang\" or \"Scoobies\". [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved. [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]] ([[Seth Green]]), a fellow student, rock guitarist and werewolf, joins the group through his relationship with Willow. [[Jenny Calendar]] ([[Robia LaMorte]]), Sunnydale's computer science teacher, joins the group after helping destroy a demon trapped in cyberspace during season 1. She later becomes Giles' love interest. [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] ([[Emma Caulfield]]), a former vengeance demon (Anyanka) who specialized in avenging scorned women, becomes Xander's lover after losing her powers and joins the group in season four.\n\nIn Buffy's senior year at high school, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]), the other current Slayer, who was \"called\" forth when Slayer [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra Young]] ([[Bianca Lawson]]) was killed by vampire [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] ([[Juliet Landau]]), in season two. Although Faith initially fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the group, she comes to stand against them and sides with [[Richard Wilkins (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]] ([[Harry Groener]]) after accidentally killing a human in season three. She reappears briefly in the fourth season, looking for vengeance, and moves to ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' where she voluntarily goes to jail for her murders. Faith reappears in season seven of ''Buffy'', after having helped Angel and his crew, and fights alongside Buffy against The First Evil.\n\nBuffy gathers other allies: [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus (Angel) and one of Buffy's major enemies in early seasons, although they later become allies and lovers. At the end of season six, Spike regains his soul. Spike is known for his [[Billy Idol]]-style [[peroxide blond]] hair and his black leather coat, stolen from a previous Slayer, [[Nikki Wood]]; her son, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]] ([[D. B. Woodside]]), joins the group in the final season. [[Tara Maclay]] ([[Amber Benson]]) is a fellow member of Willow's [[Wicca]] group during season four, and their friendship eventually turns into a romantic relationship. Buffy becomes involved personally and professionally with [[Riley Finn]] ([[Marc Blucas]]), a military operative in \"the Initiative\", which hunts demons using science and technology. The final season sees [[geek]]y wannabe-villain [[Andrew Wells]] ([[Tom Lenk]]) come to side with the Scoobies after initially being their captive/hostage; they regard him more as a nuisance than an ally.\n\n''Buffy'' featured dozens of recurring characters, both major and minor. For example, the \"Big Bad\" (villain) characters were featured for at least one season (for example, [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]] is a character who appeared in 12 episodes, spanning much of season five). Similarly, characters who allied themselves to the group and characters who attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.\n\n===Setting and filming locations===\n{{Main|Sunnydale}}\n[[File:Torrance High School.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Torrance High School]] was used for the fictional Sunnydale High School.]]\nThe show is set in the fictional California town of Sunnydale, whose suburban [[Sunnydale High|Sunnydale High School]] sits on top of a \"Hellmouth\", a gateway to demon realms. The Hellmouth, located beneath the school library, is a source of mystical energies as well as a [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena. In addition to being an open-ended plot device, Joss Whedon has cited the Hellmouth and \"[[High school (North America)|High school]] as [[Hell]]\" as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series.<ref>Yovanovich, Linda, \"Young Blood\", ''Smgfan.com'', originally from ''OnSat'' (July 14, 1997), Whedon said: \"[High school as hell] was always the basis of the show. When they said, 'Do you want to turn it into a show?' The character was not enough alone to sustain it. But you know when I thought of the idea of the horror movies as a metaphor for high school, [I said] okay this is something that will work week to week.\"</ref>\n\nMost of ''Buffy'' was shot on location in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The high school used in the first three seasons is actually [[Torrance High School]], in [[Torrance, California]], the same high school used for [[Beverly Hills, 90210]].<ref name=\"torrence\">\"[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/buffy.html Buffy the Vampire Slayer film locations]\", ''Movie-locations.com''</ref> The show was initially very dependent on location shooting, because the production budget allowed for few permanent sets to be built.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\">{{cite video |title=Designing Buffy Featurette |medium=dvd |year=1998 |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Video}}</ref> In Season One this was limited to the interior of Sunnydale High (the library, hallways, and classrooms), Buffy's bedroom, and the Master's underground lair.

While the show is mainly a [[drama]] with frequent [[comic relief]], most episodes blend different [[genre]]s, including [[horror film|horror]], [[martial arts]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[melodrama]], [[farce]], [[science fiction]], [[Screwball comedy film|comedy]], and even, in [[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|one episode]], [[musical comedy]].\n\nThe series' narrative revolves around Buffy and her friends, collectively dubbed the \"Scooby Gang\", who struggle to balance the fight against [[supernatural]] evils with their complex social lives.<ref name=\"FtF-Intro\" /> The show mixes complex, season-long storylines with a [[Villain of the week|villain-of-the-week]] format; a typical episode contains one or more [[villain]]s, or supernatural phenomena, that are thwarted or defeated by the end of the episode. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[hero]]ine. Gellar described the show as \"the ultimate metaphor: horrors of adolescence manifesting through these actual monsters. It's the hardest time of life.\"<ref name = \"Guardian 21 July 2018\">{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/21/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-to-be-remade-21-years-after-first-episode |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer to be remade 21 years after first episode |date=July 21, 2018 |accessdate=July 22, 2018 |first=Vanessa |last=Thorpe}}</ref>\n\nIn the first few seasons, the most prominent monsters in the [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings|''Buffy'' bestiary]] are [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. As the series continues, Buffy and her companions fight an increasing variety of [[Grimslaw demon|demons]], as well as [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Ghosts and spirits|ghosts]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Undead|zombies]], and [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Dangerous Mortals|unscrupulous humans]].

PLEASE DO NOT ENLARGE IT. ALSO, KEEP IN MIND THIS SECTION NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT BTVS. KEEP IT SIMPLE! -->\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 1)|Season one]] exemplifies the \"high school is hell\" concept. [[Buffy Summers]] has just moved to [[Sunnydale]] after burning down her old school's gym, and hopes to escape her Slayer duties. Her plans are complicated by [[Rupert Giles]], her new [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. Sunnydale High is built atop a Hellmouth, a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area. Buffy befriends two schoolmates, [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]], who help her fight evil throughout the series, but they must first prevent [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]], an ancient and especially threatening vampire, from opening the Hellmouth and taking over Sunnydale.\n\nThe emotional stakes are raised in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 2)|season two]]. Vampires [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] and [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] (weakened from a mob in [[Prague]], which, it is implied, caused her debilitating injury), come to town along with a new slayer, [[Kendra Young]], who was activated as a result of Buffy's brief death in the [[Prophecy Girl|season one finale]]. Xander becomes involved with [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]], while Willow becomes involved with witchcraft and [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]], who is a werewolf. The romantic relationship between Buffy and the vampire [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] develops over the course of the season, but after they have sex, Angel's soul, given to him by a Gypsy curse in the past, is lost, and he once more becomes Angelus, a sadistic killer. Kendra is killed by a restored Drusilla. Angelus torments much of the \"Scooby Gang\" throughout the rest of the season and murders multiple innocents and Giles' new girlfriend [[Jenny Calendar]], a [[Romani people|gypsy]] who was sent to maintain Angel's curse. To avert an apocalypse, Buffy is forced to banish Angel to a demon dimension just moments after Willow has restored his soul. The ordeal leaves Buffy emotionally shattered, and she leaves Sunnydale.\n\nAfter attempting to start a new life in Los Angeles, Buffy returns to town in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 3)|season three]]. Angel has mysteriously been released from the demon dimension, but is close to insanity due to the torment he suffered there, and is nearly driven to [[suicide]] by the [[First Evil]]. He and Buffy realize that a relationship between them can never happen; he eventually leaves Sunnydale at the end of the season. A new watcher named Wesley is put in Giles' place when Giles is fired from the Watcher's Council because he has developed a \"father's love\" for Buffy; and towards the end of the season, Buffy announces that she will no longer be working for the Council. Early in the season, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]], the Slayer activated after Kendra's death. She also encounters the affable [[Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]], who secretly has plans to \"ascend\" (become a \"pure\" demon) on Sunnydale High's Graduation Day. Although Faith initially works well with Buffy, she becomes increasingly unstable after accidentally killing a human and forms a relationship with the paternal yet manipulative Mayor, eventually landing in a coma after a fight with Buffy. At the end of the season, after the Mayor becomes a huge snake-like demon, Buffy and the entire graduating class destroy him by blowing up Sunnydale High.\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4)|Season four]] sees Buffy and Willow enroll at [[University of California|UC]] Sunnydale, while Xander joins the workforce and begins dating [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]], a former vengeance demon. Spike returns as a series regular and is abducted by The Initiative, a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. They implant a [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] in his head that punishes him whenever he tries to harm a human. He makes a truce with the Scooby Gang and begins to fight on their side, purely for the joy of fighting, upon learning that he can still harm other demons. Oz leaves town after realizing that he is too dangerous as a werewolf, and Willow falls in love with [[Tara Maclay]], another witch. Buffy begins dating [[Riley Finn]], a graduate student and member of The Initiative. Although appearing to be a well-meaning anti-demon operation, The Initiative's sinister plans are revealed when [[Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Adam]], a monster secretly built from parts of humans, demons and machinery, escapes and begins to wreak havoc on the town. Adam is destroyed by a magical composite of Buffy and her three friends, and The Initiative is shut down.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5)|season five]], a younger sister, [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], suddenly appears in Buffy's life; although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there. Buffy is confronted by [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]], an exiled Hell God who is searching for a [[The Key (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|\"Key\"]] that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension and in the process blur the lines between dimensions and unleash Hell on Earth. It is later discovered that the Key's protectors have used Buffy's blood to turn the Key into human form \u2013 Dawn \u2013 concurrently implanting everybody with lifelong memories of her. The Watcher's Council aids in Buffy's research on Glory, and she and Giles are both reinstated on their own terms. Riley leaves early in the season after realizing that Buffy does not love him and joins a military demon-hunting operation. Spike, still implanted with the Initiative chip, realizes he is in love with Buffy and increasingly helps the Scoobies in their fight. Buffy's mother [[Joyce Summers|Joyce]] dies of a brain [[aneurysm]], while at the end of the season, Xander proposes to Anya. Glory finally discovers that Dawn is the key and kidnaps her, using Dawn's blood to open a portal to the Hell dimension. To save Dawn, Buffy sacrifices her own life by diving into the portal and thus closes it with her death.\n\nAt the beginning of [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 6)|season six]], Buffy has been dead for 147 days, but Buffy's friends resurrect her through a powerful spell, believing they have rescued her from a Hell dimension. Buffy returns in a deep depression, explaining (several episodes later) that she had been in [[Heaven]] and is devastated to be pulled back to Earth. Giles returns to England because he has concluded that Buffy has become too reliant on him, while Buffy takes up a fast-food job to support herself and Dawn, and develops a secret, mutually abusive sexual relationship with Spike. Dawn suffers from [[kleptomania]] and feelings of alienation, Xander leaves Anya at the altar (after which she once again becomes a vengeance demon), and Willow becomes addicted to magic, causing Tara to temporarily leave her. They also begin to deal with [[Trio (Buffyverse)|The Trio]], a group of [[nerd]]s led by [[Warren Mears]] who use their proficiency in technology and magic to attempt to kill Buffy and take over Sunnydale. Warren is shown to be the only competent villain of the group and, after Buffy thwarts his plans multiple times and the Trio breaks apart, he becomes unhinged and attacks Buffy with a gun, accidentally killing Tara in the process. This causes Willow to descend into nihilistic darkness and unleash all of her dark magical powers, killing Warren and attempting to kill his friends. Giles returns to face her in battle and infuses her with light magic, tapping into her remaining humanity. This overwhelms Willow with guilt and pain, whereupon she attempts to destroy the world to end everyone's suffering, although it eventually allows Xander to reach through her pain and end her rampage. Late in the season, after losing control and trying to rape Buffy, Spike leaves Sunnydale and travels to see a demon and asks him to \"return him to what he used to be\" so that he can \"give Buffy what she deserves\". After Spike passes a series of brutal tests, the demon restores his soul.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7)|season seven]], it is revealed that Buffy's second resurrection caused instability that is allowing the First Evil to begin tipping the balance between good and evil. It begins by hunting down and killing inactive [[Potential Slayers]], and soon raises an army of ancient, powerful [[Turok-Han]] vampires. After the Watchers' Council is destroyed, a number of Potential Slayers (some brought by Giles) take refuge in Buffy's house. Faith returns to help fight The First Evil, and the new Sunnydale High School's principal, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]], also joins the cause. The Turok-Han vampires and a sinister, [[misogyny|misogynistic]] preacher known as [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]] begin causing havoc for the Scoobies. As the Hellmouth becomes more active, nearly all of Sunnydale's population \u2013 humans and demons alike \u2013 flee. In the series finale, Buffy kills Caleb, and Angel returns to Sunnydale with an amulet, which Buffy gives to Spike; the Scoobies then surround the Hellmouth and the Potential Slayers descend into its cavern, while Willow casts a spell that activates their Slayer powers.

Then the episode's story was \"broken\" into acts and scenes. Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode following the [[television advertisement|commercial break]]. The writers collectively filled in scenes surrounding these act breaks for a more fleshed-out story. A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene. Once \"breaking\" was done, the credited author wrote an outline for the episode, which was checked by Whedon or Noxon. The writer then wrote a full script, which went through a series of drafts, and finally a quick rewrite from the showrunner. The final article was used as the shooting script.\n\n===Broadcast history and syndication===\n[[File:UPN Promo Buffy Season 6.jpg|thumb|upright|UPN took great advantage promoting the network switch by teasing fans of Buffy's resurrection from The WB's series finale.]]\n''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' first aired on March 10, 1997, (as a mid season replacement for the show ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'') on the [[The WB Television Network|WB network]], and played a key role in the growth of the [[Warner Bros.]] television network in its early years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kff.org |date=March 9, 2005 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Schneider, Michael |author2=Adalian, Josef |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |title=WB revisits glory days |work=Variety |date=June 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218025029/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |archivedate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> After five seasons, it transferred to the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]) for its final two seasons.

Buffy asks her if she ever got it back. Willow's line was to reply \"most of it\". Hannigan decided on an upbeat and happy delivery of the line \"most of it\", as opposed to a sad, depressed delivery. Hannigan figured Willow would be happy and proud that she got \"most of it\" back.

At times, it performed better in the [[Nielsen ratings]] than its parent series did.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\"/>\n\nThe series was given a darker tone, focusing on the ongoing trials of Angel in Los Angeles. His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul, punishment for more than a century of murder and torture. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a [[private detective]] in a fictionalized version of [[Los Angeles, California]], where he and his associates work to \"help the helpless\", to restore the faith and \"save the souls\" of those who have lost their way. Typically, this mission involves doing battle with demons or demonically allied humans (primarily the law firm Wolfram & Hart), while Angel must also contend with his own violent nature. In season five, the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel, giving him control of their Los Angeles office. Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside.\n\nIn addition to Boreanaz, ''Angel'' inherited ''Buffy'' series cast regular [[Charisma Carpenter]] ([[Cordelia Chase]]). When [[Glenn Quinn]] ([[Doyle (Angel)|Doyle]]) left the series during its first season, [[Alexis Denisof]] ([[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]]), who played a recurring character in the last nine episodes of season three of ''Buffy'', took his place. Carpenter and Denisof were followed later by [[Mercedes McNab]] ([[Harmony Kendall]]) and [[James Marsters]] ([[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]). Several actors and actresses who played ''Buffy'' characters made guest appearances on ''Angel'', including [[Seth Green]] ([[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]]), [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] ([[Buffy Summers]]), [[Eliza Dushku]] ([[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]]), [[Tom Lenk]] ([[Andrew Wells]]), [[Alyson Hannigan]] ([[Willow Rosenberg]]), [[Julie Benz]] ([[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]]), [[Mark Metcalf]] ([[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]]), [[Julia Lee (actress)|Julia Lee]] ([[Anne Steele (Buffyverse)|Anne Steele]]) and [[Juliet Landau]] ([[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]]). Angel also continued to appear occasionally on ''Buffy''.\n\nOther actors that appeared in both the ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Angel'' series but as different characters include: Bob Fimiani as Mr. Ward, a head of the Department of Defense in ''Buffy'' and Glith-roo, a Codger Demon in ''Angel''; [[Carlos Jacott]] as a demon named Ken in ''Buffy'' and a different demon named Richard Stanley in ''Angel''; [[Jonathan M. Woodward]] as a vampire and former classmate in ''Buffy'' named Holden Webster and Knox, a Wolfram and Heart scientist in ''Angel''; and [[Andy Umberger]] who played a demon name D'Hoffryn in ''Buffy'' and predator named Ronald Meltzer in ''Angel''.\n\nThe storyline has been continued in the comic book series ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'' published by [[IDW Publishing]] and later ''[[Angel and Faith]]'' published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].\n\n===Expanded universe===\n{{Main|Buffyverse canon|Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|List of Buffyverse comics}}\n[[File:Long way home tpb.jpg|thumb|upright|Trade paperback cover of ''Buffy: Season Eight'' [[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|Volume One]], written by Joss Whedon.]]\nOutside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called \"Buffyverse [[Expanded Universe]]\". The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity. Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the Expanded Universe, and sometimes contradicted such continuity.\n\n[[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] has published the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|''Buffy'' comics]] since 1998.<ref>\"[http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/98-372-a/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-1-photo-cover Buffy the Vampire Slayer#1]\" ''Dark Horse Comics'' (\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer #1\" released September 23, 1998).</ref> In 2003, Whedon wrote an eight-issue miniseries for Dark Horse Comics titled ''[[Fray (comic)|Fray]]'', about a Slayer in the future. Following the publication of ''[[Tales of the Vampires]]'' in 2004, ''Dark Horse Comics'' halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company produced Whedon's ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'' with forty issues from March 2007 to January 2011, picking up where the television show left off\u2014taking the place of an eighth [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] season.<ref name=\"ew-firstlook\"/> The first story arc is also written by Whedon, and is called \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" which has been widely well-received, with circulation rivaling industry leaders [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] top-selling titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comicsbeat.com/dc-comics-month-to-month-sales-april-2007/ |title=DC Comics Month-to-month Sales: April 2007 |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |publisher=The Beat}}</ref> Also after \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" came other story arcs like Faith's return in \"[[No Future for You]]\" and a ''Fray'' cross-over in \"[[Time of Your Life (Buffy comic)|Time of Your Life]]\". Dark Horse later followed ''Season Eight'' with ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]'', starting in 2011, and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten]]'', which began in 2014. Dark Horse continued to publish ''Buffy'' comics continuing the story after the television show until September 2018 when they released the final issue of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve]]'' which intended to bring closure to the series. Following the end of Dark Horse's ''Buffy'' series, [[Boom! Studios]] acquired the license to publish ''Buffy'' comics. Taking a different approach from Dark Horse, Boom! Studios decided to publish a new rebooted ''Buffy'' series in 2019 with many elements updated to be more contemporary. Boom!

These projects remain undeveloped and may never be [[greenlight|greenlit]]. In 2002, two potential spinoffs were in discussion: ''[[Buffy: The Animated Series]]'' and [[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Ripper|''Ripper'']]. ''Buffy: The Animated Series'' was a proposed animated TV show based on ''Buffy''; Whedon and [[Jeph Loeb]] were to be executive producers for the show, and most of the cast from ''Buffy'' were to return to voice their characters. [[20th Century Fox Television|20th Century Fox]] showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three-minute pilot was completed in 2004 but was never picked up. Whedon revealed to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'': \"We just could not find a home for it. We had six or seven hilarious scripts from our own staff \u2013 and nobody wanted it.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1889839 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204043/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1889839 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |title=Dialogue with 'Buffy' creator Joss Whedon |author=Hockensmith, Steve |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=May 16, 2003 |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Neither the pilot nor the scripts have been seen outside of the entertainment industry, though writer [[Jane Espenson]] has teasingly revealed small extracts from some of her scripts for the show.<ref>Espenson, Jane, \"[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000095.php Reading what's been written to sound written as it's spoken]\", ''Janeespenson.com'' (May 9, 2006) & \"[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000097.php Sorry, JVC, but it's simply true]\", ''Janeespenson.com'' (May 11, 2006).</ref>\n\n''Ripper'' was originally a proposed television show based upon the character of [[Rupert Giles]] portrayed by [[Anthony Stewart Head]]. More recent information has suggested that if ''Ripper'' were ever made, it would be a TV movie or a [[Direct-to-video|DVD movie]].<ref>''[[Buffyverse Magazines (UK)|UK Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel Magazine]]''.

[[UPN]] in 2001, viewing figures had fallen. The series' high came during the third season, with 5.3 million viewers (including repeats). This was probably due to the fact that both Gellar and Hannigan had hit movies out during the season (''[[Cruel Intentions]]'' and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' respectively). The series' low was in season one at 3.7 million. The show's series finale \"[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]\" pulled in a season high of 4.9&nbsp;million viewers on the UPN network.<ref name=\"s7 ratings\">{{cite web |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |title='Buffy' Finale Stakes Strong Ratings for UPN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030524173301/http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |archivedate=May 24, 2003 |date=May 21, 2003 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |publisher=Zap2it}}</ref>\n\n''Buffy'' did not compete with shows on the main four networks ([[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), but The WB was impressed with the young audience that the show was bringing in. Because of this, The WB ordered a full season of 22 episodes for the series' second season. Beginning with the episode \"[[Innocence (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Innocence]]\", which was watched by 8.2&nbsp;million people, ''Buffy'' was moved from Monday at 9:00&nbsp;pm to launch The WB's new night of programming on Tuesday. Due to its large success in that time slot, it remained on Tuesdays at 8:00&nbsp;pm for the remainder of its original run. With its new timeslot on The WB, the show quickly climbed to the top of The WB ratings and became one of their highest-rated shows for the remainder of its time on the network. The show always placed in the top 3, usually only coming in behind ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''. Between seasons three and five, ''Buffy'' flip-flopped with ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Charmed]]'' as the network's second highest-rated show.\n\nIn the 2001\u20132002 season, the show had moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB. While it was still one of the highest rated shows on their network, The WB felt that the show had already peaked and was not worth giving a salary increase to the cast and crew. UPN on the other hand had strong faith in the series and picked it up for a two-season renewal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title='Buffy' picks up stakes, leaves WB for UPN |publisher=CNN |date=April 23, 2001 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211104047/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM%3ASHOWBIZ |archivedate=December 11, 2011}}</ref> UPN dedicated a two-hour premiere to the series to help re-launch it.

{"title_page": "As the Stomach Turns", "text_new": "'''\"As the Stomach Turns\"''' is a series of [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] parodying the [[soap opera]] ''[[As the World Turns]]'' (or its title, at any rate) featured on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', with one installment airing on ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]''. The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref> ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967\u201368 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marion Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter was when Marion's niece Raven (played by [[Bernadette Peters]] in a guest spot) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marion assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marion who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|oldest man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marion's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson, Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, \"As My World Still Turns\", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Fulton stated that when she was contacted to be a guest star on the ''Burnett'' show, she suggested a parody of a soap called \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Ultimately Fulton ended up not appearing on the ''Burnett'' show, but the \"Stomach Turns\" sketch did.<ref>{{cite book|title= As My World Still Turns|last= Fulton|first= Eileen|authorlink= |author2= Atholl, Desmond|author3= Cherkinian, Michael|year= 1996|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 1-55972-274-6|oclc= 31606927|pages= |url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/asmyworldstilltu00fult}}</ref>\n* [[Cher]] appeared on an episode of \"As the Stomach Turns\" as Pocahontas Pirelli, \"the town half-breed: half-Indian, and half-dressed,\" which was a play on her hit song of the time, \"[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]].\" She came in wearing a Native American headdress and a bikini top.\n* In an early sketch, Carol Burnett opens the door to find Harvey Korman as Mother Marcus for the character's first appearance on the show. When rehearsing the sketch, Korman never appeared in costume but spoke in the voice. When Burnett opened the door in dress rehearsal it was the first time she had actually seen him dressed up as the character. Burnett's reaction (pausing, struggling to regain her composure before slamming the door in his face, then cracking up when she opened the door again to move the script along) was completely genuine.\n\n==Sketches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest stars\n|-\n| Season 1\n| Ep 21\n| February 12, 1968\n| Marion's friend Victoria's long lost son is found after 15 years.\n| [[Martha Raye]], [[Betty Grable]]\n|-\n| Season 2\n| Ep 6\n| November 4, 1968\n| Marion and her widow friend Laura come back from a funeral.\n| [[Lucille Ball]], [[Eddie Albert]], [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]]\n|-\n| Season 3\n| Ep 5\n| October 20, 1969\n| Marion is planning on sending her grandfather away to Sun City.\n| [[Tim Conway]], [[Ken Berry]]\n|-\n| Season 3\n| Ep 6\n| November 3, 1969\n| Marion's brother Teddy comes for a visit and announces he's engaged to Miss Lily, the \"town naughty lady\".\n| [[Gwen Verdon]], [[Pat Boone]]\n|-\n| Season 4\n| Ep 3\n| September 28, 1970\n| Marion's friend Joyce announces she's a kleptomaniac.\n| [[Nanette Fabray]], Nancy Wilson\n|-\n| Season 4\n| Ep 11\n| November 23, 1970\n| Marion's rich friend Louise and the Canoga Twins come over for a visit.\n| [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Paul Lynde]]\n|-\n| Season 4\n| Ep 21\n| February 15, 1971\n| Marion's friend Estelle announces she's a werewolf.\n| [[Totie Fields]]\n|-\n| Season 4\n| Ep 26\n| March 29, 1971\n| Marion tells her friend Ren\u00e9e that she is broke and Felix Murdock the banker comes to foreclose on her house.\n| Nanette Fabray, Paul Lynde\n|-\n| Season 5\n| Ep 3\n| October 6, 1971\n| Marion's friend Jinx Vandenberg suffers from bad luck.\n| [[Carol Channing]], [[Steve Lawrence]]\n|-\n| Season 5\n| Ep 7\n| November 3, 1971\n| Marion's visitors are town masochist Mel Torment and Mother Marcus.\n| [[Bing Crosby]], Paul Lynde\n|-\n| Season 5\n| Ep 8\n| November 10, 1971\n| Marion's modelling friend Suzie Shrimpton comes back to Canoga Falls.\n| [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Cass Elliot]]\n|-\n| Season 6\n| Ep 8\n| November 1, 1972\n| Marion goes to the circus.\n| [[Jerry Stiller]], [[Anne Meara]]\n|-\n| Season 6\n| Ep 20\n| February 17, 1973\n| Marion's friend David is deathly afraid of women.\n| [[Valerie Harper]], Tim Conway\n|-\n| Season 7\n| Ep 9\n| November 10, 1973\n| While desperately seeking a problem, Marion meets her long-lost twin sister.\n| [[Petula Clark]]\n|-\n| Season 7\n| Ep 20\n| February 16, 1974\n| Marion's niece Raven is possessed by the devil.\n| Bernadette Peters\n|-\n| Season 8\n| Ep 11\n| December 7, 1974\n| Don Provolone comes to blackmail Marion.\n| Steve Lawrence\n|-\n| Season 9\n| Ep 3\n| September 27, 1975\n| Pocahontas Perrelli visits and Canoga Falls has a new hairdresser, Warren Pretty \n| [[Cher]]\n|-\n| Season 10\n| Ep 20\n| February 26, 1977\n| Marion comes back from her daughter Jamie's funeral, only to realize that she's not dead but [[The Bionic Woman|bionic]].\n| N/A\n|-\n| Season 11\n| Ep 21\n| March 5, 1978\n| Marion's daughter comes back to Canoga Falls with an alien.\n| [[Steve Martin]], [[Betty White]]\n|-\n| ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]''\n| Ep 1.4\n| September 8, 1979\n| Marion is surprised by a visit from Pamela, a \"Miss America\" pageant winner on the lam.\n| [[Sally Field]]\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}}\n\n[[Category:Comedy sketches]]\n[[Category:Television soap opera parodies]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "text_old": "'''\"As the Stomach Turns\"''' is a series of [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] parodying the [[soap opera]] ''[[As the World Turns]]'' (or its title, at any rate) featured on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', with one installment airing on ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]''.

This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marion who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|oldest man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marion's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson, Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, \"As My World Still Turns\", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Fulton stated that when she was contacted to be a guest star on the ''Burnett'' show, she suggested a parody of a soap called \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Ultimately Fulton ended up not appearing on the ''Burnett'' show, but the \"Stomach Turns\" sketch did.<ref>{{cite book|title= As My World Still Turns|last= Fulton|first= Eileen|authorlink= |author2= Atholl, Desmond|author3= Cherkinian, Michael|year= 1996|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 1-55972-274-6|oclc= 31606927|pages= |url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/asmyworldstilltu00fult}}</ref>\n* [[Cher]] appeared on an episode of \"As the Stomach Turns\" as Pocahontas Pirelli, \"the town half-breed: half-Indian, and half-dressed,\" which was a play on her hit song of the time, \"[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]].\" She came in wearing a Native American headdress and a bikini top.\n* In an early sketch, Carol Burnett opens the door to find Harvey Korman as Mother Marcus for the character's first appearance on the show. When rehearsing the sketch, Korman never appeared in costume but spoke in the voice. When Burnett opened the door in dress rehearsal it was the first time she had actually seen him dressed up as the character. Burnett's reaction (pausing, struggling to regain her composure before slamming the door in his face, then cracking up when she opened the door again to move the script along) was completely genuine.\n\n==Sketches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest stars\n|-\n| Season 1\n| Ep 21\n| February 12, 1968\n| Marion's friend Victoria's long lost son is found after 15 years.\n| [[Martha Raye]], [[Betty Grable]]\n|-\n| Season 2\n| Ep 6\n| November 4, 1968\n| Marion and her widow friend Laura come back from a funeral.\n| [[Lucille Ball]], [[Eddie Albert]], [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]]\n|-\n| Season 3\n| Ep 5\n| October 20, 1969\n| Marion is planning on sending her grandfather away to Sun City.\n| [[Tim Conway]], [[Ken Berry]]\n|-\n| Season 3\n| Ep 6\n| November 3, 1969\n| Marion's brother Teddy comes for a visit and announces he's engaged to Miss Lily, the \"town naughty lady\".\n| [[Gwen Verdon]], [[Pat Boone]]\n|-\n| Season 4\n| Ep 3\n| September 28, 1970\n| Marion's friend Joyce announces she's a kleptomaniac.\n| [[Nanette Fabray]], Nancy Wilson\n|-\n| Season 4\n| Ep 11\n| November 23, 1970\n| Marion's rich friend Louise and the Canoga Twins come over for a visit.\n| [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Paul Lynde]]\n|-\n| Season 4\n| Ep 21\n| February 15, 1971\n| Marion's friend Estelle announces she's a werewolf.\n| [[Totie Fields]]\n|-\n| Season 4\n| Ep 26\n| March 29, 1971\n| Marion tells her friend Ren\u00e9e that she is broke and Felix Murdock the banker comes to foreclose on her house.\n| Nanette Fabray, Paul Lynde\n|-\n| Season 5\n| Ep 3\n| October 6, 1971\n| Marion's friend Jinx Vandenberg suffers from bad luck.\n| [[Carol Channing]], [[Steve Lawrence]]\n|-\n| Season 5\n| Ep 7\n| November 3, 1971\n| Marion's visitors are town masochist Mel Torment and Mother Marcus.\n| [[Bing Crosby]], Paul Lynde\n|-\n| Season 5\n| Ep 8\n| November 10, 1971\n| Marion's modelling friend Suzie Shrimpton comes back to Canoga Falls.\n| [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Cass Elliot]]\n|-\n| Season 6\n| Ep 8\n| November 1, 1972\n| Marion goes to the circus.\n| [[Jerry Stiller]], [[Anne Meara]]\n|-\n| Season 6\n| Ep 20\n| February 17, 1973\n| Marion's friend David is deathly afraid of women.\n| [[Valerie Harper]], Tim Conway\n|-\n| Season 7\n| Ep 9\n| November 10, 1973\n| While desperately seeking a problem, Marion meets her long-lost twin sister.\n| [[Petula Clark]]\n|-\n| Season 7\n| Ep 20\n| February 16, 1974\n| Marion's niece Raven is possessed by the devil.\n| Bernadette Peters\n|-\n| Season 8\n| Ep 11\n| December 7, 1974\n| Don Provolone comes to blackmail Marion.\n| Steve Lawrence\n|-\n| Season 9\n| Ep 3\n| September 27, 1975\n| Pocahontas Perrelli visits and Canoga Falls has a new hairdresser, Warren Pretty \n| [[Cher]]\n|-\n| Season 10\n| Ep 20\n| February 26, 1977\n| Marion comes back from her daughter Jamie's funeral, only to realize that she's not dead but [[The Bionic Woman|bionic]].\n| N/A\n|-\n| Season 11\n| Ep 21\n| March 5, 1978\n| Marion's daughter comes back to Canoga Falls with an alien.\n| [[Steve Martin]], [[Betty White]]\n|-\n| ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]''\n| Ep 1.4\n| September 8, 1979\n| Marion is surprised by a visit from Pamela, a \"Miss America\" pageant winner on the lam because she wants to hold the title forever.\n| [[Sally Field]]\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}}\n\n[[Category:Comedy sketches]]\n[[Category:Television soap opera parodies]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSketches", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_the_Stomach_Turns"}

In Europe, it was released for Windows on June 20, 2003, and the GameCube and Xbox on March 4, 2005. A [[PlayStation 2]] version was also planned, but it was cancelled for unknown reasons. The game was released for Windows in the United States on September 22, 2003. A mobile port of the game was released worldwide for the iOS and Android on May 25, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nWoody is an average man who has a happy life, until his neighbor Mr. Rottweiler makes his life miserable. Woody decides to take full revenge on Mr. Rottweiler and calls to TV crew, which produces title [[reality show]] that shows the neighbor's relations form worst site.\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn the game, the player plays as Woody, who creeps around the Rottweiler's house performing tricks upon the unsuspecting resident. Woody is the star of a new TV show with the same name, with cameras that track every move as the player sets traps such as sawing the chair, banana peels/soap on the floor, smeared paintings and messing with home equipment. The game's objectives are to create disarray, increase ratings, and win awards. Obstacles in the game include the watchful neighbour himself, also - his guard dog, and a parrot called ''Chilli'', both of whom will try to alert the neighbour of Woody's presence. If Woody is caught by the Rottweiler, he is shown being brutally beaten and it is implied that Woody will be beaten to death. Then the episode is failed and player must restart the level.\n\nEach level's goal is to play some crude tricks on your neighbor by using every item near the player's character. Each stage has 4 or 5 zones (not including the training stages). Woody must move from zone to zone, as well as hide under the bed and in wardrobe to avoid caught. The neighbor moves in the house by his own routine, which can be disrupted in different ways (such as call him to make him go downstairs) or he gets distracted automatically (for example, painting, washing clothes and so on). The game starts with only few rooms (the hall, bathroom, kitchen and the living room), but as the game progresses, more rooms are unlocked (in Season 2 is the balcony and bedroom, and in Season 3 is the basement and study), making the game more difficult.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 69/100<ref name=MCPC>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/neighbors-from-hell|title=Neighbors from Hell for PC Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref><br />(Xbox) 49/100<ref name=MCXB>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/neighborsfromhell|title=Neighbours From Hell (xbx: 2005): Reviews|website=Metacritic|publisher=[[CNET]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913102810/http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/neighborsfromhell|archivedate=September 13, 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref><br />(GC) 41/100<ref name=MCGC>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/gamecube/neighbors-from-hell|title=Neighbors From Hell for GameCube Reviews|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 6.7/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Colayco|first=Bob|date=September 23, 2003|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/neighbors-from-hell-review/1900-6075608/|title=Neighbors From Hell Review (PC)|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| IGN = 7/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Blevins|first=Tal|date=October 1, 2003|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/02/neighbors-from-hell-review|title=Neighbors from Hell Review (PC)|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]''\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Saltzman|first=Marc|date=September 2, 2003|url=http://cincinnati.com/freetime/games/reviews/090203_nfh.html|title=Neighbors from Hell (PC)|newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060330175729/http://cincinnati.com/freetime/games/reviews/090203_nfh.html|archivedate=March 30, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe PC version received \"average\" reviews, while the GameCube and Xbox versions received \"generally unfavorable reviews\", according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggeregation]] website [[Metacritic]].<ref name=MCPC/><ref name=MCXB/><ref name=MCGC/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Sequel==\n{{main|Neighbours from Hell 2: On Vacation}}\nIn 2004 a sequel was released, called ''[[Neighbours from Hell 2: On Vacation]]''.
