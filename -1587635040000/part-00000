She began performing at religious events at the age of four and participated in the second season of the singing reality show, ''[[Indian Idol]],'' in which she was eliminated early in the show. After several struggles in her career, she made her Bollywood debut as a chorus singer in the film ''[[Meerabai Not Out]]'' (2008). She rose to prominence upon the release of the dance track \"Second Hand Jawani\" from ''[[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]]'' (2012) which was followed by several other popular party songs including \"Sunny Sunny\" from ''[[Yaariyan (2014 film)|Yaariyan]]'' (2014) and \"London Thumakda\" from ''[[Queen (soundtrack)|Queen]]'' (2014).\n\nAfterwards, she mostly performed party tracks like \"Aao Raja\" from ''[[Gabbar Is Back]]'' (2015), \"Tu Isaq Mera\" from ''[[Hate Story 3]]'' (2015), \"Humne Pee Rakhi Hai\" from ''[[Sanam Re]]'' (2016) and \"Kar Gayi Chull\" from ''[[Kapoor & Sons]]'' (2016). She proved her versatility in musical range with the release of \"Mile Ho Tum\" from ''[[Fever (2016 film)|Fever]]'' (2016) which topped the [[List of most-viewed Indian videos on YouTube|list of most-viewed Bollywood songs on YouTube]]. She then released several chart-busters which made into the same list, including \"[[Aankh Maarey]]\" from ''[[Simmba]]'' (2018), \"[[Dilbar (song)|Dilbar]]\" from ''[[Satyameva Jayate]]'' (2018), \"Badri Ki Dulhania\" from ''[[Badrinath Ki Dulhania]]'' (2017), \"Cheez Badi\" from ''[[Machine (2017 film)|Machine]]'' (2017), \"Kala Chashma\" for the film ''[[Baar Baar Dekho]]'' (2016)  and the non-film song \"[[Nikle Currant]]\", all of which crossed over six hundred million views. Similarly, \"Dilbar\" marks the first Indian song to reach number three spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' YouTube Music Chart.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, Kakkar, primarily, in collaboration with [[Tanishk Bagchi]], became more associated with the trend of remaking old to very recent songs, which resulted in several backlashes targeted for the singer, though she personally favoured the trend of recreations and opined that they have been well-appreciated. Apart from playback singing, Kakkar has appeared in several music videos and as a judge on several television reality shows including ''Indian Idol'', the same show she participated during her early days. On these shows, she has been trolled in social media several times, for crying on-screen, while she openly admits that she is a \"proud emotional girl.\" She appeared in the ''[[Forbes|India Forbes]]'' Celebrity 100 in 2017 and 2019.\n\n==Early life==\nKakkar was born on 6 June 1988 in [[Rishikesh]], [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite news | url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/neha-kakkar-birthday-special-the-queen-of-blockbuster-hits-turns-28-1237772/ | title=Neha Kakkar birthday special: The Queen of blockbuster hits turns 28 | author=India.com Entertainment Desk|date=6 June 2016 | work=India.com | accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | title=Indian Idol profile - Neha Kakkar | work=[[Sify]] | accessdate=11 February 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608031628/http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | archivedate=8 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She is the younger sister of playback singer [[Sonu Kakkar]] and singer-composer [[Tony Kakkar]].<ref name=Tony>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/Tony-Kakkar-One-gets-a-lot-more-popularity-as-a-singer-than-a-composer/articleshow/53209745.cms |title=Tony Kakkar: One gets a lot more popularity as a singer than a composer |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=17 March 2017 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> During the early days, her father, Rishikesh Kakkar used to sell [[samosa]] outside a college for a living while her mother Niti Kakkar was a homemaker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/indian-idols-neha-kakkar-and-aditya-to-get-married-on-valentines-day-she-calls-his-mother-sasu-maa-watch-hilarious-video/articleshow/73232215.cms |title=Indian Idol's Neha Kakkar and Aditya to get married on Valentine's Day?

She began performing at religious events at the age of four and participated in the second season of the singing reality show, ''[[Indian Idol]],'' in which she was eliminated early in the show. After several struggles in her career, she made her Bollywood debut as a chorus singer in the film ''[[Meerabai Not Out]]'' (2008). She rose to prominence upon the release of the dance track \"Second Hand Jawani\" from ''[[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]]'' (2012) which was followed by several other popular party songs including \"Sunny Sunny\" from ''[[Yaariyan (2014 film)|Yaariyan]]'' (2014) and \"London Thumakda\" from ''[[Queen (soundtrack)|Queen]]'' (2014).\n\nAfterwards, she mostly performed party tracks like \"Aao Raja\" from ''[[Gabbar Is Back]]'' (2015), \"Tu Isaq Mera\" from ''[[Hate Story 3]]'' (2015), \"Humne Pee Rakhi Hai\" from ''[[Sanam Re]]'' (2016) and \"Kar Gayi Chull\" from ''[[Kapoor & Sons]]'' (2016). She proved her versatility in musical range with the release of \"Mile Ho Tum\" from ''[[Fever (2016 film)|Fever]]'' (2016) which topped the [[List of most-viewed Indian videos on YouTube|list of most-viewed Bollywood songs on YouTube]]. She then released several chart-busters which made into the same list, including \"[[Aankh Maarey]]\" from ''[[Simmba]]'' (2018), \"[[Dilbar (song)|Dilbar]]\" from ''[[Satyameva Jayate]]'' (2018), \"Badri Ki Dulhania\" from ''[[Badrinath Ki Dulhania]]'' (2017), \"Cheez Badi\" from ''[[Machine (2017 film)|Machine]]'' (2017), \"Kala Chashma\" for the film ''[[Baar Baar Dekho]]'' (2016)  and the non-film song \"[[Nikle Currant]]\", all of which crossed over six hundred million views. Similarly, \"Dilbar\" marks the first Indian song to reach number three spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' YouTube Music Chart.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, Kakkar, primarily, in collaboration with [[Tanishk Bagchi]], became more associated with the trend of remaking old to very recent songs, which resulted in several backlashes targeted for the singer, though she personally favoured the trend of recreations and opined that they have been well-appreciated. Apart from playback singing, Kakkar has appeared in several music videos and as a judge on several television reality shows including ''Indian Idol'', the same show she participated during her early days. On these shows, she has been trolled in social media several times, for crying on-screen, while she openly admits that she is a \"proud emotional girl.\" She appeared in the ''[[Forbes|India Forbes]]'' Celebrity 100 in 2017 and 2019.\n\n==Early life==\nKakkar was born on 6 June 1988 in [[Rishikesh]], [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite news | url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/neha-kakkar-birthday-special-the-queen-of-blockbuster-hits-turns-28-1237772/ | title=Neha Kakkar birthday special: The Queen of blockbuster hits turns 28 | author=India.com Entertainment Desk|date=6 June 2016 | work=India.com | accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | title=Indian Idol profile - Neha Kakkar | work=[[Sify]] | accessdate=11 February 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608031628/http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | archivedate=8 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She is the younger sister of playback singer [[Sonu Kakkar]] and singer-composer [[Tony Kakkar]].<ref name=Tony>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/Tony-Kakkar-One-gets-a-lot-more-popularity-as-a-singer-than-a-composer/articleshow/53209745.cms |title=Tony Kakkar: One gets a lot more popularity as a singer than a composer |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=17 March 2017 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> During the early days, her father, Rishikesh Kakkar used to sell [[samosa]] outside a college for a living while her mother Niti Kakkar was a homemaker.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/indian-idols-neha-kakkar-and-aditya-to-get-married-on-valentines-day-she-calls-his-mother-sasu-maa-watch-hilarious-video/articleshow/73232215.cms |title=Indian Idol's Neha Kakkar and Aditya to get married on Valentine's Day?

DDR SDRAM, also retroactively called DDR1 SDRAM, has been superseded by [[DDR2 SDRAM]], [[DDR3 SDRAM]] and [[DDR4 SDRAM]]. None of its successors are [[Forward compatibility|forward]] or [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with DDR1 SDRAM, meaning DDR2, DDR3, and DDR4 [[memory module]]s will not work in DDR1-equipped [[motherboard]]s, and vice versa.\n\nCompared to single data rate ([[SDRAM#SDR SDRAM|SDR]]) SDRAM, the DDR SDRAM [[External memory interface|interface]] makes higher transfer rates possible by more strict control of the timing of the electrical data and clock signals. Implementations often have to use schemes such as [[phase-locked loop]]s and self-calibration to reach the required timing accuracy.<ref>[http://www.nwlogic.com/docs/ASIC_DDR_PHY.pdf Northwest Logic DDR Phy datasheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821101233/http://www.nwlogic.com/docs/ASIC_DDR_PHY.pdf |date=2008-08-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp701.pdf|title=Memory Interfaces Data Capture Using Direct Clocking Technique (Xilinx application note)|author=|date=|website=xilinx.com}}</ref> The interface uses [[double data rate|double pumping]] (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the [[clock signal]]) to double data bus bandwidth without a corresponding increase in clock frequency. One advantage of keeping the clock frequency down is that it reduces the [[signal integrity]] requirements on the circuit board connecting the memory to the controller. The name \"double data rate\" refers to the fact that a DDR SDRAM with a certain clock frequency achieves nearly twice the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of a SDR SDRAM running at the same clock frequency, due to this double pumping.\n\nWith data being transferred 64 [[bit]]s at a time, DDR SDRAM gives a transfer rate (in bytes/s) of (memory bus clock rate) \u00d7 2 (for dual rate) \u00d7 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus, with a bus frequency of 100&nbsp;MHz, DDR SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 1600&nbsp;[[MB/s]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Samsung]] demonstrated the first DDR memory prototype in 1997,<ref name=\"techpowerup\">{{cite web |title=Samsung 30 nm Green PC3-12800 Low Profile 1.35 V DDR3 Review |url=https://www.techpowerup.com/review/samsung-mv-3v4g3/ |website=TechPowerUp |accessdate=25 June 2019 |date= March 8, 2012}}</ref> and released the first commercial DDR SDRAM chip (64{{nbsp}}[[Mebibit|Mb]]) in June 1998,<ref name=\"samsung99\">{{cite news |title=Samsung Electronics Develops First 128Mb SDRAM with DDR/SDR Manufacturing Option |url=https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/insights/news-events/samsung-electronics-develops-first-128mb-sdram-with-ddr-sdr-manufacturing-option/ |accessdate=23 June 2019 |work=[[Samsung Electronics]] |publisher=[[Samsung]] |date=10 February 1999}}</ref><ref name=\"samsung98\">{{cite news |title=Samsung Electronics Comes Out with Super-Fast 16M DDR SGRAMs |url=https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/insights/news-events/samsung-electronics-comes-out-with-super-fast-16m-ddr-sgrams/ |accessdate=23 June 2019 |work=[[Samsung Electronics]] |publisher=[[Samsung]] |date=17 September 1998}}</ref><ref name=\"phys\">{{cite news |title=Samsung Demonstrates World's First DDR 3 Memory Prototype |url=https://phys.org/news/2005-02-samsung-world-ddr-memory-prototype.html |accessdate=23 June 2019 |work=[[Phys.org]] |date=17 February 2005 |language=en-us}}</ref> followed soon after by [[Hyundai Electronics]] (now [[SK Hynix]]) the same year.<ref name=\"hynix90s\">{{cite web |title=History: 1990s |url=https://www.skhynix.com/eng/about/history1990.jsp |website=[[SK Hynix]] |accessdate=6 July 2019}}</ref> The development of DDR began in 1996, before its specification was finalized by [[JEDEC]] in June 2000 (JESD79).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.design-reuse.com/articles/13805/the-love-hate-relationship-with-ddr-sdram-controllers.html | title = The Love/Hate Relationship with DDR SDRAM Controllers}}</ref>  JEDEC has set standards for data rates of DDR SDRAM, divided into two parts.

For instance, the 64-bit data bus for DIMM requires eight 8-bit chips, addressed in parallel. Multiple chips with the common address lines are called a [[memory rank]]. The term was introduced to avoid confusion with chip internal '''rows''' and '''banks'''. A memory module may bear more than one rank. The term '''sides''' would also be confusing because it incorrectly suggests the physical placement of chips on the module. All ranks are connected to the same memory bus (address + data). The [[chip select]] signal is used to issue commands to specific rank.\n\nAdding modules to the single memory bus creates additional electrical load on its drivers. To mitigate the resulting bus signaling rate drop and overcome the [[Von Neumann architecture#Von Neumann bottleneck|memory bottleneck]], new [[chipsets]] employ the [[dual-channel|multi-channel]] architecture.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Comparison of DDR SDRAM standards\n\n! colspan=\"3\" scope=\"col\" | Name\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | [[Chip (computing)|Chip]]\n! colspan=\"3\" scope=\"col\" | [[Bus (computing)|Bus]]\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | [[Memory timings|Timings]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | [[Voltage]] {{Small|([[Volt|V]])}}\n\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Standard\n! scope=\"col\" | Type\n! scope=\"col\" | Module\n! scope=\"col\" |[[Clock rate]] {{Small|([[MHz]])}}\n! scope=\"col\" | Cycle time {{Small|([[Nanosecond|ns]])}}<ref>Cycle time is the inverse of the I/O bus clock frequency; e.g., 1/(100&nbsp;MHz) = 10&nbsp;ns per clock cycle.</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | Clock rate {{Small|(MHz)}}\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Transfer (computing)|Transfer rate]] {{Small|(MT/s)}}\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]] <small>([[MB/s]])</small>\n! scope=\"col\" | CL-T{{Sub|RCD}}-T{{Sub|RP}}\n! scope=\"col\" | [[CAS latency]] {{Small|(ns)}}\n\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | DDR-200\n| PC-1600\n| 100\n| 10\n| 100 \n| 200\n| 1600\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2.5\u00b10.2\n\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | DDR-266\n| PC-2100\n| 133\u2153\n| 7.5\n| 133\u2153\n| 266.67\n| 2133\u2153\n| 2.5-3-3\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | DDR-333\n| PC-2700\n| 166\u2154\n| 6\n| 166\u2154\n| 333\u2153\n| 2666\u2154\n|\n| 2.5\n\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" scope=\"row\" | DDR-400\n| A\n| rowspan=\"3\" | PC-3200\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 200\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 5\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 200\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 400\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 3200\n| 2.5-3-3\n| 3\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2.6\u00b10.1\n\n|-\n| B\n| 3-3-3\n| 2.5\n|-\n| C\n| 3-4-4\n| 2\n|}\n\n'''Note:''' All above listed are specified by [[JEDEC]] as JESD79F.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/docs/jesd-79f|title=DOUBLE DATA RATE (DDR) SDRAM STANDARD - JEDEC|author=|date=|website=www.jedec.org}}</ref> All RAM data rates in-between or above these listed specifications are not standardized by JEDEC\u2014often they are simply manufacturer optimizations using tighter-tolerance or overvolted chips. The package sizes in which DDR SDRAM is manufactured are also standardized by JEDEC.\n\nThere is no architectural difference between DDR SDRAM modules. Modules are instead designed to run at different clock frequencies: for example, a PC-1600 module is designed to run at {{nowrap|100 MHz}}, and a PC-2100 is designed to run at {{nowrap|133 MHz}}. A module's clock speed designates the data rate at which it is guaranteed to perform, hence it is guaranteed to run at lower (''[[underclocking]]'') and can possibly run at higher (''[[overclocking]]'') clock rates than those for which it was made.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crucial.com/support/memory_speeds.aspx|title=What is the difference between PC-2100 (DDR-266), PC-2700 (DDR-333), and PC-3200 (DDR-400)?|publisher=Micron Technology, Inc.|access-date=2009-06-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004412/http://www.crucial.com/support/memory_speeds.aspx|archive-date=2013-12-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDDR SDRAM modules for desktop computers, [[DIMM|dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs)]], have 184 pins (as opposed to 168 pins on SDRAM, or 240 pins on DDR2 SDRAM), and can be differentiated from SDRAM DIMMs by the number of notches (DDR SDRAM has one, SDRAM has two). DDR SDRAM for notebook computers, [[SO-DIMM]]s, have 200 pins, which is the same number of pins as DDR2 SO-DIMMs. These two specifications are notched very similarly and care must be taken during insertion if unsure of a correct match. Most DDR SDRAM operates at a voltage of 2.5&nbsp;V, compared to 3.3&nbsp;V for SDRAM. This can significantly reduce power consumption. Chips and modules with DDR-400/PC-3200 standard have a nominal voltage of 2.6&nbsp;V.\n\nJEDEC Standard No. 21\u2013C defines three possible operating voltages for 184 pin DDR, as identified by the key notch position relative to its centreline. Page 4.5.10-7 defines 2.5V (left), 1.8V (centre), TBD (right), while page 4.20.5\u201340 nominates 3.3V for the right notch position. The orientation of the module for determining the key notch position is with 52 contact positions to the left and 40 contact positions to the right.\n\nIncreasing operating voltage slightly can increase maximum speed, at the cost of higher power dissipation and heating, and at the risk of malfunctioning or damage.\n\n;Capacity\n;Number of DRAM devices: The number of chips is a multiple of 8 for non-[[Error-correcting code|ECC]] modules and a multiple of 9 for ECC modules. Chips can occupy one side (''single sided'') or both sides (''dual sided'') of the module. The maximal number of chips per DDR module is 36 (9\u00d74) for ECC and 32 (8x4) for non-ECC.\n;ECC vs non-ECC: Modules that have [[Error detection and correction#Error-correcting memory|error-correcting code]] are labeled as [[dynamic random-access memory#Error detection and correction|ECC]].  Modules without error correcting code are labeled '''non-ECC'''.\n;Timings: [[CAS latency]] (CL), clock cycle time (t<sub>CK</sub>), row cycle time (t<sub>RC</sub>), refresh row cycle time (t<sub>RFC</sub>), row active time (t<sub>RAS</sub>).\n;Buffering: [[Registered memory|registered]] (or buffered) vs [[Unbuffered memory|unbuffered]].\n;Packaging: Typically [[DIMM]] or [[SO-DIMM]].\n;Power consumption: A test with DDR and DDR2 RAM in 2005 found that average power consumption appeared to be of the [[Order of magnitude|order]] of 1\u20133&nbsp;W per 512&nbsp;MB module; this increases with clock rate and when in use rather than idling.<ref>[http://www.silentpcreview.com/article265-page4.html Mike Chin: Power Distribution within Six PCs].</ref><!--Out of order and from 2003, but very useful <ref>[http://www.overclockers.com/articles696/]</ref>--> A manufacturer has produced calculators to estimate the power used by various types of RAM.<ref>[https://www.micron.com/support/power-calc Micron: System Power Calculators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126211816/https://www.micron.com/support/power-calc |date=2016-01-26 }}</ref>\n\nModule and chip characteristics are inherently linked.\n\nTotal module capacity is a product of one chip's capacity and the number of chips. ECC modules multiply it by 8/9 because they use 1&nbsp;bit per byte (8&nbsp;bits) for error correction. A module of any particular size can therefore be assembled either from 32 small chips (36 for ECC memory), or 16(18) or 8(9) bigger ones.\n\nDDR memory bus width per channel is 64 bits (72 for ECC memory). Total module bit width is a product of bits per chip and number of chips. It also equals number of ranks (rows) multiplied by DDR memory bus width. Consequently, a module with a greater number of chips or using \u00d78 chips instead of \u00d74 will have more ranks.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example: Variations of 1&nbsp;GB PC2100 registered DDR SDRAM module with ECC\n!

One should definitely be careful buying 1&nbsp;GB memory modules, because all these variations can be sold under one price position without stating whether they are \u00d74 or \u00d78, single- or dual-ranked.\n\nThere is a common belief that number of module ranks equals number of sides. As above data shows, this is not true.  One can also find 2-side/1-rank modules. One can even think of a 1-side/2-rank memory module having 16(18) chips on single side \u00d78 each, but it's unlikely such a module was ever produced.\n\n=== Chip characteristics ===\n;DRAM density: Size of the chip is measured in [[megabits]]. Most motherboards recognize only 1&nbsp;GB modules if they contain ''64M\u00d78'' chips ''(low density).'' If ''128M\u00d74 (high density)'' 1&nbsp;GB modules are used, they most likely will not work. The [[JEDEC]] standard allows ''128M\u00d74'' only for slower buffered/registered modules designed specifically for some servers, but some generic manufacturers do not comply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.ebay.com/Myth-Low-Density-vs-High-Density-memory-modules_W0QQugidZ10000000001236178|title=Low Density vs High Density memory modules|author=|date=|website=ebay.com}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=November 2010}}\n;Organization: The notation like ''64M\u00d74'' means that the memory matrix has 64 million (the product of ''banks'' x ''rows'' x ''columns'') 4-bit storage locations. There are ''\u00d74, \u00d78,'' and ''\u00d716'' DDR chips. The ''\u00d74'' chips allow the use of advanced error correction features like [[Chipkill]], [[memory scrubbing]] and Intel SDDC in server environments, while the ''\u00d78'' and ''\u00d716'' chips are somewhat less expensive. ''x8'' chips are mainly used in desktops/notebooks but are making entry into the server market. There are normally 4 banks and only one row can be active in each bank.\n\n==== Double data rate (DDR) SDRAM specification ====\nFrom Ballot JCB-99-70, and modified by numerous other Board Ballots, formulated under the cognizance of Committee JC-42.3 on DRAM Parametrics.\n\nStandard No. 79 Revision Log:\n*Release 1, June 2000\n*Release 2, May 2002\n*Release C, March 2003 \u2013 JEDEC Standard No. 79C.<ref>http://www.jedec.org/download/search/JESD79F.pdf DOUBLE DATA RATE (DDR) SDRAM SPECIFICATION (Release F)</ref>\n\n\"This comprehensive standard defines all required aspects of 64Mb through 1Gb DDR SDRAMs with X4/X8/X16 data interfaces, including features, functionality, ac and dc parametrics, packages and pin assignments. This scope will subsequently be expanded to formally apply to x32 devices, and higher density devices as well.\"\n\n=== Organization ===\nPC3200 is DDR SDRAM designed to operate at 200&nbsp;MHz using DDR-400 chips with a bandwidth of 3,200&nbsp;MB/s.  Because PC3200 memory transfers data on both the rising and falling clock edges, its effective clock rate is 400&nbsp;MHz.\n\n1&nbsp;GB PC3200 non-ECC modules are usually made with 16 512&nbsp;Mbit chips, 8 on each side (512&nbsp;Mbits \u00d7 16&nbsp;chips) / (8 bits (per byte)) = 1,024&nbsp;MB.  The individual chips making up a 1&nbsp;GB memory module are usually organized as 2<sup>26</sup> 8-bit words, commonly expressed as 64M\u00d78.  Memory manufactured in this way is low-density RAM and is usually compatible with any motherboard specifying PC3200 DDR-400 memory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superuser.com/questions/138800/per-bytes-ram-memory-acess|title=Per bytes RAM memory access|website=Super User|access-date=2018-10-21}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n=== High-density RAM ===\nIn the context of the 1&nbsp;GB non-ECC PC3200 SDRAM module, there is very little visually to differentiate low-density from high-density RAM.  High-density DDR RAM modules will, like their low-density counterparts, usually be [[double-sided RAM|double-sided]] with eight 512&nbsp;Mbit chips per side.  The difference is that each chip, instead of being organized as 64M\u00d78, is organized as 2<sup>27</sup> 4-bit words, or 128M\u00d74.\n\nHigh-density memory modules are assembled using chips from multiple manufacturers.  These chips come in both the familiar 22 \u00d7 10&nbsp;mm (approx.) TSOP2 and smaller squarer 12 \u00d7 9&nbsp;mm (approx.) FBGA package sizes.  High-density chips can be identified by the numbers on each chip.\n\nHigh-density RAM devices were designed to be used in registered memory modules for servers.  JEDEC standards do not apply to high-density DDR RAM in desktop implementations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} JEDEC's technical documentation, however, supports 128M\u00d74 semiconductors {{clarify span|as such that contradicts 128\u00d74 being classified as high-density|date=December 2017}}. As such, ''high density'' is a relative term, which can be used to describe memory that is not supported by a particular motherboard's memory controller.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n== Generations ==\nDDR (DDR1) was superseded by [[DDR2 SDRAM]], which had modifications for higher clock frequency and again doubled throughput, but operates on the same principle as DDR. Competing with DDR2 was [[Rambus]] [[XDR DRAM]]. DDR2 dominated due to cost and support factors.  DDR2 was in turn superseded by [[DDR3 SDRAM]], which offered higher performance for increased bus speeds and new features.  DDR3 has been superseded by [[DDR4 SDRAM]], which was first produced in 2011 and whose standards were still in flux (2012) with significant architectural changes.\n\nDDR's prefetch buffer depth is 2 (bits), while DDR2 uses 4.  Although the effective clock rates of DDR2 are higher than DDR, the overall performance was not greater in the early implementations, primarily due to the high latencies of the first DDR2 modules.  DDR2 started to be effective by the end of 2004, as modules with lower latencies became available.<ref>[http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/memory/display/ddr2-ddr.html DDR2 vs. DDR: Revenge Gained] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121045622/http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/memory/display/ddr2-ddr.html |date=2006-11-21 }}</ref>\n\nMemory manufacturers stated that it was impractical to mass-produce DDR1 memory with effective transfer rates in excess of 400&nbsp;MHz (i.e. 400&nbsp;MT/s and 200&nbsp;MHz external clock) due to internal speed limitations. DDR2 picks up where DDR1 leaves off, utilizing internal clock rates similar to DDR1, but is available at effective transfer rates of 400&nbsp;MHz and higher. DDR3 advances extended the ability to preserve internal clock rates while providing higher effective transfer rates by again doubling the prefetch depth.\n\nThe DDR4 SDRAM is a high-speed dynamic random-access memory internally configured as 16 banks, 4 bank groups with 4\nbanks for each bank group for x4/x8 and 8 banks, 2 bank groups with 4 banks for each bank group for x16 DRAM.\nThe DDR4 SDRAM uses an 8n prefetch architecture to achieve high-speed operation. The 8n prefetch architecture is combined with\nan interface designed to transfer two data words per clock cycle at the I/O pins. A single read or write operation for the DDR4 SDRAM\nconsists of a single 8''n''-bit-wide 4-clock data transfer at the internal DRAM core and 8 corresponding ''n''-bit-wide half-clock-cycle data transfers at the I/O pins.<ref>{{cite web|title=DDR4 SDRAM Standard JESD79-4B|url=https://www.jedec.org}}</ref>\n\n[[RDRAM]] was a particularly expensive alternative to DDR SDRAM, and most manufacturers dropped its support from their chipsets.  DDR1 memory's prices substantially increased since Q2 2008, while DDR2 prices declined. In January 2009, 1&nbsp;GB DDR1 was 2\u20133 times more expensive than 1&nbsp;GB DDR2.  High-density DDR RAM suit about 10% of PC motherboards on the market, while low-density suit almost all motherboards on the PC Desktop market.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Comparison of DDR SDRAM generations\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Release<br>year\n! colspan=\"3\" scope=\"col\" | [[Chip (computing)|Chip]]\n! colspan=\"3\" scope=\"col\" | [[Bus (computing)|Bus]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | [[Voltage]]<br>(V)\n! colspan=\"3\" scope=\"col\" | Pins\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Gen\n! scope=\"col\" | Standard\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Clock rate]]<br>(MHz)\n! scope=\"col\" | Cycle time<br>(ns)\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Prefetch buffer|Pre-<br>fetch]]\n! scope=\"col\" | Clock rate<br>(MHz)\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Transfer (computing)|Transfer rate]]<br>([[MT/s]])\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]]<br>(MB/s)\n! scope=\"col\" | [[DIMM]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[SO-DIMM|SO-<br>DIMM]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[MicroDIMM|Micro-<br>DIMM]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" scope=\"row\" | DDR\n!DDR-200\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 2000\n| 100\n|10\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 2n\n| 100\n| 200\n|1600\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2.5\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 184\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 200\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 172\n|-\n!DDR-266\n|133\n|7.5\n|133\n|266\n|2133\n|-\n!DDR-333\n|166\u2154\n|6\n|166\u2154\n|333\n|2666\u2154\n|-\n!DDR-400\n|200\n|5\n|200\n|400\n|3200\n|2.6\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" scope=\"row\" |[[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2]]\n!DDR2-400\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 2003\n| 100\n|10\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 4n\n| 200\n| 400\n|3200\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 1.8\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 240\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 200\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 214\n|-\n!DDR2-533\n|133\u2153\n|7.5\n|266\u2154\n|533\u2153\n|4266\u2154\n|-\n!DDR2-667\n|166\u2154\n|6\n|333\u2153\n|666\u2154\n|5333\u2153\n|-\n!DDR2-800\n|200\n|5\n|400\n|800\n|6400\n|-\n!DDR2-1066\n|266\u2154\n|3.75\n|533\u2153\n|1066\u2154\n|8533\u2153\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" scope=\"row\" |[[DDR3 SDRAM|DDR3]]\n!DDR3-800\n| rowspan=\"6\" | 2007\n| 100\n|10\n| rowspan=\"6\" | 8n\n| 400\n| 800\n|6400\n| 1.5/1.35\n| rowspan=\"6\" | 240\n| rowspan=\"6\" | 204\n| rowspan=\"6\" | 214\n|-\n!DDR3-1066\n|133\u2153\n|7.5\n|533\u2153\n|1066\u2154\n|8533\u2153\n|\n|-\n!DDR3-1333\n|166\u2154\n|6\n|666\u2154\n|1333\u2153\n|10666\u2154\n|\n|-\n!DDR3-1600\n|200\n|5\n|800\n|1600\n|12800\n|\n|-\n!DDR3-1866\n|233\u2153\n|4.29\n|933\u2153\n|1866\u2154\n|14933\u2153\n|\n|-\n!DDR3-2133\n|266\u2154\n|3.75\n|1066\u2154\n|2133\u2153\n|17066\u2154\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"7\" scope=\"row\" |[[DDR4 SDRAM|DDR4]]\n!DDR4-1600\n| rowspan=\"7\" | 2014\n| 200\n|5\n| rowspan=\"7\" | 8n\n| 800\n| 1600\n|12800\n| 1.2/1.05\n| rowspan=\"7\" | 288\n| rowspan=\"7\" | 260\n|\n|-\n!DDR4-1866\n|233\u2153\n|4.29\n|933\u2153\n|1866\u2154\n|14933\u2153\n|\n|\n|-\n!DDR4-2133\n|266\u2154\n|3.75\n|1066\u2154\n|2133\u2153\n|17066\u2154\n|\n|\n|-\n!DDR4-2400\n|300\n|3\u2153\n|1200\n|2400\n|19200\n|\n|\n|-\n!DDR4-2666\n|333\u2153\n|3\n|1333\u2153\n|2666\u2154\n|21333\u2153\n|\n|\n|-\n!DDR4-2933\n|366\u2154\n|2.73\n|1466\u2154\n|2933\u2153\n|23466\u2154\n|\n|\n|-\n!DDR4-3200\n|400\n|2.5\n|1600\n|3200\n|25600\n|\n|\n|}\n\n=== Mobile DDR ===\n{{Main|LPDDR}}\n\nMDDR is an acronym that some enterprises use for [[Mobile DDR]] SDRAM, a type of memory used in some portable electronic devices, like [[mobile phone]]s, [[handheld]]s, and [[digital audio player]]s.

Implementations often have to use schemes such as [[phase-locked loop]]s and self-calibration to reach the required timing accuracy.<ref>[http://www.nwlogic.com/docs/ASIC_DDR_PHY.pdf Northwest Logic DDR Phy datasheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821101233/http://www.nwlogic.com/docs/ASIC_DDR_PHY.pdf |date=2008-08-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp701.pdf|title=Memory Interfaces Data Capture Using Direct Clocking Technique (Xilinx application note)|author=|date=|website=xilinx.com}}</ref> The interface uses [[double data rate|double pumping]] (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the [[clock signal]]) to double data bus bandwidth without a corresponding increase in clock frequency. One advantage of keeping the clock frequency down is that it reduces the [[signal integrity]] requirements on the circuit board connecting the memory to the controller. The name \"double data rate\" refers to the fact that a DDR SDRAM with a certain clock frequency achieves nearly twice the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of a SDR SDRAM running at the same clock frequency, due to this double pumping.\n\nWith data being transferred 64 [[bit]]s at a time, DDR SDRAM gives a transfer rate (in bytes/s) of (memory bus clock rate) \u00d7 2 (for dual rate) \u00d7 64 (number of bits transferred) / 8 (number of bits/byte). Thus, with a bus frequency of 100&nbsp;MHz, DDR SDRAM gives a maximum transfer rate of 1600&nbsp;[[MB/s]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Samsung]] demonstrated the first DDR memory prototype in 1997,<ref name=\"techpowerup\">{{cite web |title=Samsung 30 nm Green PC3-12800 Low Profile 1.35 V DDR3 Review |url=https://www.techpowerup.com/review/samsung-mv-3v4g3/ |website=TechPowerUp |accessdate=25 June 2019 |date= March 8, 2012}}</ref> and released the first commercial DDR SDRAM chip (64{{nbsp}}[[Mebibit|Mb]]) in June 1998,<ref name=\"samsung99\">{{cite news |title=Samsung Electronics Develops First 128Mb SDRAM with DDR/SDR Manufacturing Option |url=https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/insights/news-events/samsung-electronics-develops-first-128mb-sdram-with-ddr-sdr-manufacturing-option/ |accessdate=23 June 2019 |work=[[Samsung Electronics]] |publisher=[[Samsung]] |date=10 February 1999}}</ref><ref name=\"samsung98\">{{cite news |title=Samsung Electronics Comes Out with Super-Fast 16M DDR SGRAMs |url=https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/insights/news-events/samsung-electronics-comes-out-with-super-fast-16m-ddr-sgrams/ |accessdate=23 June 2019 |work=[[Samsung Electronics]] |publisher=[[Samsung]] |date=17 September 1998}}</ref><ref name=\"phys\">{{cite news |title=Samsung Demonstrates World's First DDR 3 Memory Prototype |url=https://phys.org/news/2005-02-samsung-world-ddr-memory-prototype.html |accessdate=23 June 2019 |work=[[Phys.org]] |date=17 February 2005 |language=en-us}}</ref> followed soon after by [[Hyundai Electronics]] (now [[SK Hynix]]) the same year.<ref name=\"hynix90s\">{{cite web |title=History: 1990s |url=https://www.skhynix.com/eng/about/history1990.jsp |website=[[SK Hynix]] |accessdate=6 July 2019}}</ref> The development of DDR began in 1996, before its specification was finalized by [[JEDEC]] in June 2000 (JESD79).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.design-reuse.com/articles/13805/the-love-hate-relationship-with-ddr-sdram-controllers.html | title = The Love/Hate Relationship with DDR SDRAM Controllers}}</ref>  JEDEC has set standards for data rates of DDR SDRAM, divided into two parts.

For instance, the 64-bit data bus for DIMM requires eight 8-bit chips, addressed in parallel. Multiple chips with the common address lines are called a [[memory rank]]. The term was introduced to avoid confusion with chip internal '''rows''' and '''banks'''. A memory module may bear more than one rank. The term '''sides''' would also be confusing because it incorrectly suggests the physical placement of chips on the module. All ranks are connected to the same memory bus (address + data). The [[chip select]] signal is used to issue commands to specific rank.\n\nAdding modules to the single memory bus creates additional electrical load on its drivers. To mitigate the resulting bus signaling rate drop and overcome the [[Von Neumann architecture#Von Neumann bottleneck|memory bottleneck]], new [[chipsets]] employ the [[dual-channel|multi-channel]] architecture.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Comparison of DDR SDRAM standards\n\n! colspan=\"3\" scope=\"col\" | Name\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | [[Chip (computing)|Chip]]\n! colspan=\"3\" scope=\"col\" | [[Bus (computing)|Bus]]\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | [[Memory timings|Timings]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | [[Voltage]] {{Small|([[Volt|V]])}}\n\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Standard\n! scope=\"col\" | Type\n! scope=\"col\" | Module\n! scope=\"col\" |[[Clock rate]] {{Small|([[MHz]])}}\n! scope=\"col\" | Cycle time {{Small|([[Nanosecond|ns]])}}<ref>Cycle time is the inverse of the I/O bus clock frequency; e.g., 1/(100&nbsp;MHz) = 10&nbsp;ns per clock cycle.</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | Clock rate {{Small|(MHz)}}\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Transfer (computing)|Transfer rate]] {{Small|(MT/s)}}\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]] <small>([[MB/s]])</small>\n! scope=\"col\" | CL-T{{Sub|RCD}}-T{{Sub|RP}}\n! scope=\"col\" | [[CAS latency]] {{Small|(ns)}}\n\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | DDR-200\n| PC-1600\n| 100\n| 10\n| 100 \n| 200\n| 1600\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2.5\u00b10.2\n\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | DDR-266\n| PC-2100\n| 133\u2153\n| 7.5\n| 133\u2153\n| 266.67\n| 2133\u2153\n| 2.5-3-3\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | DDR-333\n| PC-2700\n| 166\u2154\n| 6\n| 166\u2154\n| 333\u2153\n| 2666\u2154\n|\n| 2.5\n\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" scope=\"row\" | DDR-400\n| A\n| rowspan=\"3\" | PC-3200\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 200\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 5\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 200\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 400\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 3200\n| 2.5-3-3\n| 3\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2.6\u00b10.1\n\n|-\n| B\n| 3-3-3\n| 2.5\n|-\n| C\n| 3-4-4\n| 2\n|}\n\n'''Note:''' All above listed are specified by [[JEDEC]] as JESD79F.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/docs/jesd-79f|title=DOUBLE DATA RATE (DDR) SDRAM STANDARD - JEDEC|author=|date=|website=www.jedec.org}}</ref> All RAM data rates in-between or above these listed specifications are not standardized by JEDEC\u2014often they are simply manufacturer optimizations using tighter-tolerance or overvolted chips. The package sizes in which DDR SDRAM is manufactured are also standardized by JEDEC.\n\nThere is no architectural difference between DDR SDRAM modules. Modules are instead designed to run at different clock frequencies: for example, a PC-1600 module is designed to run at {{nowrap|100 MHz}}, and a PC-2100 is designed to run at {{nowrap|133 MHz}}. A module's clock speed designates the data rate at which it is guaranteed to perform, hence it is guaranteed to run at lower (''[[underclocking]]'') and can possibly run at higher (''[[overclocking]]'') clock rates than those for which it was made.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crucial.com/support/memory_speeds.aspx|title=What is the difference between PC-2100 (DDR-266), PC-2700 (DDR-333), and PC-3200 (DDR-400)?|publisher=Micron Technology, Inc.|access-date=2009-06-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004412/http://www.crucial.com/support/memory_speeds.aspx|archive-date=2013-12-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDDR SDRAM modules for desktop computers, [[DIMM|dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs)]], have 184 pins (as opposed to 168 pins on SDRAM, or 240 pins on DDR2 SDRAM), and can be differentiated from SDRAM DIMMs by the number of notches (DDR SDRAM has one, SDRAM has two). DDR SDRAM for notebook computers, [[SO-DIMM]]s, have 200 pins, which is the same number of pins as DDR2 SO-DIMMs. These two specifications are notched very similarly and care must be taken during insertion if unsure of a correct match. Most DDR SDRAM operates at a voltage of 2.5&nbsp;V, compared to 3.3&nbsp;V for SDRAM. This can significantly reduce power consumption. Chips and modules with DDR-400/PC-3200 standard have a nominal voltage of 2.6&nbsp;V.\n\nJEDEC Standard No. 21\u2013C defines three possible operating voltages for 184 pin DDR, as identified by the key notch position relative to its centreline. Page 4.5.10-7 defines 2.5V (left), 1.8V (centre), TBD (right), while page 4.20.5\u201340 nominates 3.3V for the right notch position. The orientation of the module for determining the key notch position is with 52 contact positions to the left and 40 contact positions to the right.\n\nIncreasing operating voltage slightly can increase maximum speed, at the cost of higher power dissipation and heating, and at the risk of malfunctioning or damage.\n\n;Capacity\n;Number of DRAM devices: The number of chips is a multiple of 8 for non-[[Error-correcting code|ECC]] modules and a multiple of 9 for ECC modules. Chips can occupy one side (''single sided'') or both sides (''dual sided'') of the module. The maximal number of chips per DDR module is 36 (9\u00d74) for ECC and 32 (8x4) for non-ECC.\n;ECC vs non-ECC: Modules that have [[Error detection and correction#Error-correcting memory|error-correcting code]] are labeled as [[dynamic random-access memory#Error detection and correction|ECC]].  Modules without error correcting code are labeled '''non-ECC'''.\n;Timings: [[CAS latency]] (CL), clock cycle time (t<sub>CK</sub>), row cycle time (t<sub>RC</sub>), refresh row cycle time (t<sub>RFC</sub>), row active time (t<sub>RAS</sub>).\n;Buffering: [[Registered memory|registered]] (or buffered) vs [[Unbuffered memory|unbuffered]].\n;Packaging: Typically [[DIMM]] or [[SO-DIMM]].\n;Power consumption: A test with DDR and DDR2 RAM in 2005 found that average power consumption appeared to be of the [[Order of magnitude|order]] of 1\u20133&nbsp;W per 512&nbsp;MB module; this increases with clock rate and when in use rather than idling.<ref>[http://www.silentpcreview.com/article265-page4.html Mike Chin: Power Distribution within Six PCs].</ref><!--Out of order and from 2003, but very useful <ref>[http://www.overclockers.com/articles696/]</ref>--> A manufacturer has produced calculators to estimate the power used by various types of RAM.<ref>[https://www.micron.com/support/power-calc Micron: System Power Calculators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126211816/https://www.micron.com/support/power-calc |date=2016-01-26 }}</ref>\n\nModule and chip characteristics are inherently linked.\n\nTotal module capacity is a product of one chip's capacity and the number of chips. ECC modules multiply it by 8/9 because they use 1&nbsp;bit per byte (8&nbsp;bits) for error correction. A module of any particular size can therefore be assembled either from 32 small chips (36 for ECC memory), or 16(18) or 8(9) bigger ones.\n\nDDR memory bus width per channel is 64 bits (72 for ECC memory). Total module bit width is a product of bits per chip and number of chips. It also equals number of ranks (rows) multiplied by DDR memory bus width. Consequently, a module with a greater number of chips or using \u00d78 chips instead of \u00d74 will have more ranks.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example: Variations of 1&nbsp;GB PC2100 registered DDR SDRAM module with ECC\n!

One should definitely be careful buying 1&nbsp;GB memory modules, because all these variations can be sold under one price position without stating whether they are \u00d74 or \u00d78, single- or dual-ranked.\n\nThere is a common belief that number of module ranks equals number of sides. As above data shows, this is not true.  One can also find 2-side/1-rank modules. One can even think of a 1-side/2-rank memory module having 16(18) chips on single side \u00d78 each, but it's unlikely such a module was ever produced.\n\n=== Chip characteristics ===\n;DRAM density: Size of the chip is measured in [[megabits]]. Most motherboards recognize only 1&nbsp;GB modules if they contain ''64M\u00d78'' chips ''(low density).'' If ''128M\u00d74 (high density)'' 1&nbsp;GB modules are used, they most likely will not work. The [[JEDEC]] standard allows ''128M\u00d74'' only for slower buffered/registered modules designed specifically for some servers, but some generic manufacturers do not comply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.ebay.com/Myth-Low-Density-vs-High-Density-memory-modules_W0QQugidZ10000000001236178|title=Low Density vs High Density memory modules|author=|date=|website=ebay.com}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=November 2010}}\n;Organization: The notation like ''64M\u00d74'' means that the memory matrix has 64 million (the product of ''banks'' x ''rows'' x ''columns'') 4-bit storage locations. There are ''\u00d74, \u00d78,'' and ''\u00d716'' DDR chips. The ''\u00d74'' chips allow the use of advanced error correction features like [[Chipkill]], [[memory scrubbing]] and Intel SDDC in server environments, while the ''\u00d78'' and ''\u00d716'' chips are somewhat less expensive. ''x8'' chips are mainly used in desktops/notebooks but are making entry into the server market. There are normally 4 banks and only one row can be active in each bank.\n\n==== Double data rate (DDR) SDRAM specification ====\nFrom Ballot JCB-99-70, and modified by numerous other Board Ballots, formulated under the cognizance of Committee JC-42.3 on DRAM Parametrics.\n\nStandard No. 79 Revision Log:\n*Release 1, June 2000\n*Release 2, May 2002\n*Release C, March 2003 \u2013 JEDEC Standard No. 79C.<ref>http://www.jedec.org/download/search/JESD79F.pdf DOUBLE DATA RATE (DDR) SDRAM SPECIFICATION (Release F)</ref>\n\n\"This comprehensive standard defines all required aspects of 64Mb through 1Gb DDR SDRAMs with X4/X8/X16 data interfaces, including features, functionality, ac and dc parametrics, packages and pin assignments. This scope will subsequently be expanded to formally apply to x32 devices, and higher density devices as well.\"\n\n=== Organization ===\nPC3200 is DDR SDRAM designed to operate at 200&nbsp;MHz using DDR-400 chips with a bandwidth of 3,200&nbsp;MB/s.  Because PC3200 memory transfers data on both the rising and falling clock edges, its effective clock rate is 400&nbsp;MHz.\n\n1&nbsp;GB PC3200 non-ECC modules are usually made with 16 512&nbsp;Mbit chips, 8 on each side (512&nbsp;Mbits \u00d7 16&nbsp;chips) / (8 bits (per byte)) = 1,024&nbsp;MB.  The individual chips making up a 1&nbsp;GB memory module are usually organized as 2<sup>26</sup> 8-bit words, commonly expressed as 64M\u00d78.  Memory manufactured in this way is low-density RAM and is usually compatible with any motherboard specifying PC3200 DDR-400 memory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superuser.com/questions/138800/per-bytes-ram-memory-acess|title=Per bytes RAM memory access|website=Super User|access-date=2018-10-21}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n=== High-density RAM ===\nIn the context of the 1&nbsp;GB non-ECC PC3200 SDRAM module, there is very little visually to differentiate low-density from high-density RAM.  High-density DDR RAM modules will, like their low-density counterparts, usually be [[double-sided RAM|double-sided]] with eight 512&nbsp;Mbit chips per side.  The difference is that each chip, instead of being organized as 64M\u00d78, is organized as 2<sup>27</sup> 4-bit words, or 128M\u00d74.\n\nHigh-density memory modules are assembled using chips from multiple manufacturers.  These chips come in both the familiar 22 \u00d7 10&nbsp;mm (approx.) TSOP2 and smaller squarer 12 \u00d7 9&nbsp;mm (approx.) FBGA package sizes.  High-density chips can be identified by the numbers on each chip.\n\nHigh-density RAM devices were designed to be used in registered memory modules for servers.  JEDEC standards do not apply to high-density DDR RAM in desktop implementations.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} JEDEC's technical documentation, however, supports 128M\u00d74 semiconductors {{clarify span|as such that contradicts 128\u00d74 being classified as high-density|date=December 2017}}. As such, ''high density'' is a relative term, which can be used to describe memory that is not supported by a particular motherboard's memory controller.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n== Generations ==\nDDR (DDR1) was superseded by [[DDR2 SDRAM]], which had modifications for higher clock frequency and again doubled throughput, but operates on the same principle as DDR. Competing with DDR2 was [[Rambus]] [[XDR DRAM]]. DDR2 dominated due to cost and support factors.  DDR2 was in turn superseded by [[DDR3 SDRAM]], which offered higher performance for increased bus speeds and new features.  DDR3 has been superseded by [[DDR4 SDRAM]], which was first produced in 2011 and whose standards were still in flux (2012) with significant architectural changes.\n\nDDR's prefetch buffer depth is 2 (bits), while DDR2 uses 4.  Although the effective clock rates of DDR2 are higher than DDR, the overall performance was not greater in the early implementations, primarily due to the high latencies of the first DDR2 modules.  DDR2 started to be effective by the end of 2004, as modules with lower latencies became available.<ref>[http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/memory/display/ddr2-ddr.html DDR2 vs. DDR: Revenge Gained] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121045622/http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/memory/display/ddr2-ddr.html |date=2006-11-21 }}</ref>\n\nMemory manufacturers stated that it was impractical to mass-produce DDR1 memory with effective transfer rates in excess of 400&nbsp;MHz (i.e. 400&nbsp;MT/s and 200&nbsp;MHz external clock) due to internal speed limitations. DDR2 picks up where DDR1 leaves off, utilizing internal clock rates similar to DDR1, but is available at effective transfer rates of 400&nbsp;MHz and higher. DDR3 advances extended the ability to preserve internal clock rates while providing higher effective transfer rates by again doubling the prefetch depth.\n\nThe DDR4 SDRAM is a high-speed dynamic random-access memory internally configured as 16 banks, 4 bank groups with 4\nbanks for each bank group for x4/x8 and 8 banks, 2 bank groups with 4 banks for each bank group for x16 DRAM.\nThe DDR4 SDRAM uses an 8n prefetch architecture to achieve high-speed operation. The 8n prefetch architecture is combined with\nan interface designed to transfer two data words per clock cycle at the I/O pins.

He was active mainly during the 1970s and 1980s, in the New York City and Hollywood area [[rock music|rock]] and metal scenes. \n\n==Early life==\nFox was born in [[Amityville, New York]], on [[Long Island]], and raised in the [[Poland|Polish]] neighborhood of [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]]. While in high school, Fox was interested in [[rock music]] and [[photography]], choosing as his subjects, the flashy personalities of the [[New York City]] [[glam rock|glam]] scene of the early 1970s. Among many other famous New York City bands performing on the city's club scene at such famous locales as [[Max's Kansas City]] and [[CBGB]] (clubs he would also later perform in with a group he joined during the height of the New York City club scene marking his professional debut on Halloween in 1975 at Max's, [[The Martian Rock Band (band)|the Martian Rock Band]]), he also photographed early [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. During this period, he dated a younger sister of original Kiss drummer [[Peter Criss]]. Fox and Criss became friends and Fox witnessed the formation of legendary rock band KISS from the very beginning, including the addition of lead guitarist [[Ace Frehley]]. During his formative club band years, after establishing himself on the 'scene', with [[The Martian Rock Band (band)|the Martian Rock Band]] and performing at the famed NYC club [[Max's Kansas City]] and [[CBGB]], in 1976, Fox found himself joining a well-established New Jersey glam-heavy club band making the rounds named Virgin. Virgin eventually became known as [[Sin (band)|Sin]] upon Fox's suggested band name change. From the band's biography: \"SIN was originally formed in New York/New Jersey in 1976 -77, coming out of the ashes of New Jersey club circuit bands VIRGIN and LUST, with the name SIN first being coined by bassist Rik Fox, bringing with him, drummer Basil Stanley (Stan Bassel from Long Island), joining Ian Criss and Keith (Vinny Matthews) Starz. In this line-up the band performed until 1978-79, when Criss left to join another band called Angelface. Fox retained the rights to the name SIN and, after moving to L.A. in 1982 to join Sister and name the heavy metal band [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]. After departing W.A.S.P., Fox networked around L.A. and eventually rehearsed for a short time with both [[Warlord (band)|Warlord]] and [[Hellion (band)|Hellion]] (although never recording or performing live with either band), eventually joining [[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]]<ref name=\"wikipedia1\">[[Steeler (American album)]] {{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref> for one album and after leaving [[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]],<ref name=\"wikipedia1\"/>  with now-proven club-drawing power, reformed two Los Angeles versions of SIN once again.\"\n\n==Career==\n===W.A.S.P.===\nAfter moving to [[Los Angeles, California]], at the invitation of Blackie Lawless, and arriving on February 4, 1982, Fox played bass-guitar in several bands, including [[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]], Sin, and W.A.S.P.. Although the band was called Sister upon his arrival, relatively speaking, he was only associated with W.A.S.P. for four months, February 1982-the end of May, 1982), and recorded a 'live' three-track cassette demo. He came up with the name \"W.A.S.P.\", (there were no periods in the band name at this time\u2014which was validated in an interview by former W.A.S.P. guitarist [[Randy Piper]]). The idea is said to have occurred to him after he stepped on a [[wasp]] in the courtyard of the house where he lived with band leader [[Blackie Lawless]]. The story of W.A.S.P. is retold in the books ''Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal'' by [[David Konow]], and \"W.A.S.P.; A Sting in the Tale\" by [[Darren P. Upton]], As stated, this is confirmed by W.A.S.P. guitarist [[Randy Piper]] at a time of Piper's height of drug and alcohol abuse, as well as in several online interviews with him.<ref>[http://www.fullinbloommusic.com/randy_piper.html Randy Piper Interview]</ref> On the other hand, some who witnessed the formation of W.A.S.P. explain that Rik Fox participated in the band after drummer [[Tony Richards]] showed up in the scene; according to Richards, the name was not [[Circus Circus (band)|Circus Circus]] when he joined the band.<ref>[http://www.fullinbloommusic.com/Tony_Richards_WASP.html Tony Richards Interview]</ref> Fox contends that to his recollection, the band was named [[Sister (band)|Sister]] when he joined.  Lawless has since begrudgingly confirmed that Rik Fox had indeed, been a band member but, 'only for a couple of rehearsals', which may not be entirely accurate, since Fox spent some 4 months rehearsing and writing with the band. Fox is also shown in early band photographs taken by Don Adkins Jr. during the band's first photo session. Causing a firestorm of controversy thirty years later after the fact, despite the grumblings by some die-hard W.A.S.P. fans desperately attempting to re-write a revisionist history of the band, it should be submitted for consideration that, since Fox created the bands' name while he was, in fact, an early co-founding band member, at that moment of the creation of it becoming the band now-known as W.A.S.P., technically speaking, no matter what happened to the band after Fox left, that historic point still qualifies him as an original founding member along with Lawless, Piper and Richards. \n\nAll this, has been verified and validated by former W.A.S.P. guitarist Chris Holmes who has stated he agrees to all of the information as being true.\n \t\nMany unverified allegations usually follow band membership changes, and Fox was no stranger to that. Both Lawless and Richards' narrative, allege that \"Rik Fox couldn't do it in the band, his playing was just not right\", so they \"let him go in a very short period of time.\" Which comes off as plausible, only because of Lawless's career being much stronger. However, Fox's bass tracks, found on the now rare, collectible live, 'original' W.A.S.P. 3-track demo recorded at Pipers' studio tell a very different story; showing a very solid and melodic bass style by Fox and how much Lawless' narrative was apparently incorrectly misinforming the public. Further, it should also be considered that since it is widely recognized that 'power associates itself with power', it is abundantly clear that if Fox had moved on to a larger successful career, that, thirty years later, nobody would bother attempting to dismiss or dispute his membership in W.A.S.P.; it would have obviously been openly acknowledged by Lawless. Case in point; New York City guitarist Ivan Kral co-founded the band Blondie and left before the band's first album, similar to Fox's relation to W.A.S.P. Nobody contends or disputes that point, but for Fox's situation, such is the case of being denied membership or credit in the band's history. Furthermore, the question has been put forth in many interviews: \"What would W.A.S.P. have been called, if not for Fox's membership in that first original line-up and suggestion in the first place?\" <ref>http://www.fullinbloommusic.com/Tony_Richards_WASP.html 'Full in Bloom Music' interview with Tony Richards</ref>\n\n===Steeler===\nAfter leaving W.A.S.P., Fox spent a short time rehearsing briefly with both [[Warlord (band)|Warlord]]  and [[Hellion (band)|Hellion]], and then joined the [[Ron Keel]] fronted band [[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]]<ref name=\"wikipedia1\"/> in 1983. He'd put an ad in a Los Angeles music magazine looking for a gig and got a call from Keel himself. Fox auditioned for Steeler and was offered the job, but before he'd accepted it, he was offered the bassist duties in the band Angel by keyboardist [[Greg Giuffria]]. Fox had a bit of a dilemma, being tempted by Giuffria's offer since [[Angel (band)|Angel]] was his 'dream band'. After considering both offers, Fox decided to join the hot, up and coming Steeler. Fox spent five months in Steeler, long enough to record the self-titled album and play some amazing gigs before being unceremoniously let go from the band. This apparently happened to many musicians in L.A. at the time, known for its 'revolving door' with many players constantly switching membership in bands. The decision to release Fox was apparently made by Keel and drummer Mark Edwards (who was responsible for informing Fox) for 'unspecified reasons', and caught Fox completely by surprise. Considering that the band was gaining huge momentum and doing well, this move confused both Fox and the fans, with Steeler changing line-ups twice more again within several months before finally becoming the band [[Keel (band)|Keel]]. According to Fox, Edwards has since spoken with him in 2009 and stated that he \"regretted the way the dissolution of the album line-up occurred\", further stating that \"had that line-up been able to stay together, that a major label signing would definitely have been forthcoming, and the band would have moved to the next plateau of national and international success.\" Fox actually received more mileage from his time with Steeler after his tenure with W.A.S.P., and contends that Steeler \"was one of the seminal cornerstones of the Hollywood rock scene in the early 1980s.\" This laid the groundwork that was integral for many of the bands yet to follow, such as [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] and [[Guns N' Roses]], just as the [[MTV]] era was being introduced to rock music fans. At the time of the original membership change, after Fox's membership was confirmed, Steeler acquired the services of a young, up-an-coming Swedish guitar-whiz virtuoso named [[Yngwie J. Malmsteen]], which gave the band some much-garnered attention, selling out venues and opening for the likes of [[Hughes/Thrall]], [[Vandenberg (band)|Vandenberg]], and [[Quiet Riot]] at a high point in their respective careers. Unfortunately, Steeler changed their line-up several more times before calling it quits, with [[Ron Keel]] eventually forming KEEL under his surname [[Keel (band)|Keel]].\n \nIn addition to the 'classic' Steeler debut album, two more Steeler releases have surfaced over the years in the Steeler legacy: ''[[Steeler; Excited '83]]'' (Perkins Palace, Pasadena, CA, USA, supporting [[Quiet Riot]]- a rare, excellent quality, live, collectors bootleg), and the Ron Keel released ''[[Metal Generation: The Steeler Anthology]]''. Rik Fox appears on all three albums. There are also several YouTube live bootleg Steeler performances recorded off the 'board mix' showing how talented as musicians this band really was. With show host [[Eddie Trunk]] admittedly being a big fan of Steelers' (small by comparison but equally integral) contribution to heavy metal music history, the question on the minds of the fans of [[That Metal Show]], is the oversight, 'while Yngwie Malmsteen has been a guest of the show several times, why then, has Steeler (as a band-together) been denied consideration as guests?' *Updated note: May 10th, 2019 saw a long-awaited Steeler reunion during the [[KEELFEST]] concert event held at the Alrosa Villa club in Columbus, Ohio, featuring legendary guitarist [[Mitch Perry]]. \n\n===Going solo with SIN===\nMeanwhile, after leaving Steeler, Fox was now 'on the map' and had a bankable reputation and sizable following, enough to now attempt to sell out clubs on his name alone. And so, Fox re-founded the band [[SIN (band)|SIN]]. (This happened when he formed a band and referred back to the band name he used back in his New Jersey club days going back to 1977-SIN). Fox's first L.A. line-up began to sell out clubs rapidly drawing attention, following on the heels of his popular notoriety from Steeler. However, within six months, despite recording and releasing a 'heavy' Angel-meets Judas Priest sounding, now-rare, snake-shaped collectors' picture disc single of the Fox/Drossin penned \"On the Run\" backed with \"Captured in Time\", disagreements erupted over a potential new band management direction that Fox questioned, which resulted in the previously unknown band members beginning to publicly entertain ideas of stealing the SIN band name and kicking Fox out of his own band and replace him. Things came to a head during recording what would have been their first album when, after apologizing to the producer of these sessions, [[Bill Metoyer]], Fox stormed out of the session. Wasting no time, Fox quickly re-formed another line up using three newly relocated members of the New York band, Mongol Horde recording artists [[Alien (band)|Alien]],<ref>{{cite web|author=US |url=https://www.myspace.com/alienrockband/ |title=Alien &#124; Free Music, Tour Dates, Photos, Videos |publisher=Myspace.com |date=2008-09-21 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleazegrinder.net/2012/01/flash-metal-suicide-alien.html/ |accessdate=December 22, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> who had recently disbanded in New York, contacted Fox and came to Los Angeles to join him in reforming a new line-up of SIN. This line-up enjoyed some well-noticed success, and outstandingly outdid his previous band's accomplishments, finding themselves being voted in a Los Angeles music magazine's fans poll for 'The top drawing rock/metal band cumulative for 1984 over Keel, Stryper and Odin.' \nThey headlined in dozens of packed-house concerts and shows, including the annual '[[Los Angeles Street Scene]]' before some 5,000 people. This line-up of Sin also co-headlined a show with Christian metal band [[Stryper]] and directly supported a show with his former Steeler bandmate band Ron Keel's band [[Keel (band)|Keel]].\n\nDoors were now opening for Fox and SIN. After being approached and picked up by Jerry Weintraub's 'Management 3' in Beverly Hills, Fox was 'advised' (coerced) to replace vocalist Frank C. Starr (see [[The Four Horsemen (band)|The Four Horsemen]]) and drummer Mark Anthony Benquechea who were replaced by musicians of producer Dana Strum's choosing and, with singer [[Mark Slaughter]] singing the tracking vocals they entered Encore Studios in 1985 to record album master demos, being produced by [[Vinnie Vincent]] bassist [[Dana Strum]] (who also produced among other L.A. bands, the band [[Burn (American band)|Burn]]). Showing promise, SIN now began receiving attention from the major record labels. However, despite Fox trying desperately to keep it together, misfortune struck again and the band's internal chemistry and Management issues caused Fox to disband Sin which then fell apart. To add insult to injury, producer Strum then openly violated copyright laws by handing over Fox' song \"On the Run\" to Vincent Vincent who changed the lyrics and re-recorded it as \"Let Freedom Rock\" for his own album ''[[All Systems Go (Vinnie Vincent Invasion album)]]''. When Fox attempted to sue, Strum threatened with a counter-suit to 'bleed Fox dry' and then following, Vincent claimed bankruptcy.

Shortly after, the band eventually dismissed their singer, Richard Parico. Fox then approached a fellow New Yorker, former [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] lead singer [[Neil Turbin]] to offer him the gig, which Turbin turned down in favor of his own project. During a break in rehearsals, Fox flew to Arizona to scout potential gigs for Burn. At a Loudness concert there, he was approached to join Arizona heavy metal band [[Surgical Steel (band)|Surgical Steel]], (a band formerly fronted by [[Jeff Martin (American musician)|Jeff Martin]] later in [[Badlands (American band)|Badlands]] and [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]], and featuring [[Judas Priest]] frontman [[Rob Halford]] on one of their demos). This meeting led to spending several months performing and recording an album with them and supporting the [[Lita Ford]] band for a 1987 New Year's Eve concert. Unfortunately, misfortune struck again when Surgical Steel's financial backing fell through to finish the album, and the recording deal fell through leaving the album unfinished. Fox eventually left the band, returning to Hollywood, (with apparently no 'playing issues' at fault claimed there, either). Fox had successfully recorded with [[Dokken]] drummer [[Mick Brown (musician)]] for the Surgical Steel sessions. Fox stated in his interviews that \"this pattern of bad luck began to take on the appearance of his developing a penchant for joining popular name bands that, despite looking very promising going in, were, in effect, already sinking ships... it began to look like I couldn't stay with a band for very long, which, despite outward appearances, as anyone can easily see, was not the case, since they fell part on their own soon after I left them and I had moved on to other ventures.\"\n\nHowever, in the waning years of the 1980s, Rik Fox has had the good fortune to have shared the stage and performed with some of Rock's Legends, including the late [[Ronnie James Dio]] and rock comedian [[Sam Kinison]], [[Little Steven]], Ozzy Osbourne drummer [[Randy Castillo]], as well as Kiss guitarist [[Mark St. John]], and Bruce Springsteen's drummer, \u2018Mighty\u2019 [[Max Weinberg]], (in the late 1970s),  Roseanne's [[John Goodman]], producer [[Jean Beauvoir]], as well as the band [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]] and [[Guns N' Roses]], among others at various all-star jams, or, jamming with the likes of Steppenwolf's legendary guitarist [[Michael Monarch]].\n\n===1990s===\nNot one to stand still, despite some mistaken rumors being circulated that Fox has 'not done anything significant since he left Steeler', nothing could be further from the truth; Fox's music career may have taken a slight turn, but never entirely ended. After he abandoned his last popular band, [[Thunderball (band)|Thunderball]], and then Flyboyz, in the early 1990s. He abandoned his 'pretty-boy look' and played in a local, low-key Hollywood band [[Wiseguys]], (not 'The Wiseguys'), radically camouflaging himself into a rather incognito image that better fit the band [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], than the more Glam-looking bands he created or performed with. Seeing the writing on the wall, with the arena styled rock music of the 1980s being phased out in the 1990s, many musicians began to look elsewhere for employment to survive, and so, Fox began to broaden his horizons and take a personal break from music for a while, and try some new ventures.\n\n===New interests===\nAfter having served five years in the [[California State Military Reserve]]<ref>[[California State Military Reserve]]</ref> (which is a lower civilian branch of the U.S. Army), as a radio operator/communications NCO with the rank of E4 (Corporal), his interest moved on in all things military, which brought him to working in the film industry as an assistant [[property master]], and weapons handler, working on some direct-to-video lower budget films and on the Network syndicated television series ''[[Air America (TV series)|Air America]]'', featuring [[Lorenzo Lamas]], and the late [[Scott Plank]], with whom Fox became close friends. Fox also dabbled in acting and took several film roles. He worked on the film 'Surface to Air' with [[Chad McQueen]], [[Melanie Shatner]], and [[Michael Madsen]]. Fox acted briefly on the television soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]'', acting directly with series anchor 'Luke'-[[Anthony Geary]]. Rik was also one of the featured interview subjects for the VH-1 Cable series 'Driven' for the episode \"The Rise of [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]\" being a close friend of [[Nikki Sixx]] and the band, and recommended to VH-1 producers by former Hollywood booking agent [[Vicky Hamilton (music executive)]]. Rik is also remembered as one of the featured interview subjects for the legendary Rock film parody, [[The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years]] by friend and director [[Penelope Spheeris]].\n\n====Renaissance and living history/re-enactment pioneer====\nThrough acting, he eventually became involved with the [[Renaissance Faire]] scene, and military timeline events such as the Old Fort MacArthur Days<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortmacarthur.tripod.com/ |title=Old Fort MacArthur Days |publisher=Fortmacarthur.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref> where he actively sought and succeeded to bring the noticeably absent Polish 17th century military history into the forefront. Fox has been referred to by many Polish media correspondents and others as a 'recognized pioneer' in this venture, of creating the first representation in the U.S., of the Polish winged hussar cavalry of central Europe which, apparently, is a part of his ancestry. Polish 17th century military author Bartosz Musialowicz had interviewed him and written an article about Rik, dubbing him with the honorary title of 'The First Saber of the U.S.' for founding and creating the first officially recognized representation of the Polish winged hussar cavalry in American History.  Apart from being an internationally recognized rock musician, it is of interest to note that Rik is the first Polish-American of Polish noble (not 'royal') ancestry, to 'formally', represent the [[Polish Hussars|Polish Winged Hussar]] cavalry in U.S. history.

He then stepped aside a second-term for family-related reasons.\n\n===Back to music and the Winged Hussars===\nFox is also involved in co-promotion of the European and Japanese market release of ''The Steeler Anthology'' with former bandmate [[Ron Keel]]. A discussion of a possible Steeler reunion performance has been left open-ended so far.<ref>{{cite web|last=Parks |first=John |url=http://www.legendaryrockinterviews.com/2011/12/18/legendary-rock-interview-with-rik-fox-ex-w-a-s-p-steeler-and-sin/ |title=Legendary Rock Interview with Rik Fox (ex- W.A.S.P., STEELER and SIN) |publisher=Legendary Rock Interviews |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref>\nAlthough he has not left the music field entirely, broadening his horizons, in recent years, Fox has taken a new interest in learning the field of [[natural horsemanship]] through his wife Tamara, (married on October 1, 2009 in a small private ceremony), and they train their (rescued) horses, while he continues to work on his pursuit of raising Polish historical awareness and culture and military history with their winged hussar group. Fox, today, is also making a comeback in music. Through Shrapnel Records producer [[Mike Varney]], Fox has recently re-connected with fellow Steeler bandmate and drummer Mark Edwards.\n\nRenewed interest is being shown to Steeler, by [[DJ Shadow]], who expressed interest in using some of Steeler's music for a new project, which will possibly revive an interest in Steeler once again for the next 'Metal Generation' to come as well as previous fans who still listen to their classic album. Rik Fox was interviewed in the 2011 book release ''W.A.S.P.; A Sting in the Tale'' by author [[Darren P. Upton]], and asked to share his input on the early days of the band's creation of which he is now known to have been an original founding member of.\n\nFox was also featured in three more book releases. The first book which will feature Fox, is by NPR personality Charlie Schroeder, titled ''Man of War'', regarding Schroeder's Walter Mitty-like embedded experiences of participating with various re-enactments of warriors of military history to see and experience what it was like to be those historical warriors. Among the many historical impressions in the book, Schroeder spent a day with Fox's Polish Winged Hussar living history group fully suited up in the famous winged armor. In the meantime, The second book, by KISS author Ken Sharp for the ''New York Times'' bestseller ''Nothing to Lose'' regarding the band [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] in their formative years, of which Fox was an active part. The book features various first-hand historical anecdotes and exclusive early live photos contributed by Fox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lovelylaurahardrockradiolive.podomatic.com/entry/2012-02-13T16_56_30-08_00 |title=PodOmatic &#124; Best Free Podcasts |publisher=Lovelylaurahardrockradiolive.podomatic.com |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://themetalreview.com/?p=3189 |accessdate=March 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714112953/http://themetalreview.com/?p=3189 |archivedate=July 14, 2015 }}</ref>\nRik Fox is also slated to be among the featured popular performers in the upcoming coffee table book 'Lost Rockers' scheduled for a 2015 publication release. The third book, by historian Miltiades Varvounis, titled ''Made in Poland: The Women and Men Who Changed the World'', in which Rik Fox was included among author's list of the 100 most influential Polish people that changed the world.\n\nIn promoting his ancestral noble Polish heritage, Rik was featured as a 17th-century Polish winged hussar cavalry-knight figure in the Documentary film \"[[Path to Glory; The Rise and Rise of the Polish Arabian Horse]]\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pathtogloryfilm.com/About.html |title=Path to Glory The Rise and Rise of the Polish Arabian Horse |publisher=Pathtogloryfilm.com |accessdate=2013-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020234720/http://pathtogloryfilm.com/About.html |archive-date=2013-10-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as well as having been the featured subject in 2013, for the (Canadian) History Channel cable television series [[Museum Secrets]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsecrets.tv/ |title=Museum Secrets |publisher=Museumsecrets.tv |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref> (Kensington Productions), which selects various curious topics of history and expounds upon them. In Rik's case, for the episode dealing with the Moscow State Museum in Russia, and a suit of Polish winged armor on display there, the director and producer sought him out because, in the words of the segment producer: 'of all his active research on the subject and what he has brought to the table with regard to his being the most highly visible contributions of promoting the winged hussars and Polish history in the United States.' The episode dedicated to the winged hussars for Season Three is considered ground-breaking for finally producing valuable information being made available to the mainstream public in the English-language on the winged hussars, which was a major accomplishment and a dream come true for Fox.\n\nIn addition to returning to music or reform another band line-up, Rik Fox has also recorded bass tracks for the re-make Rascal's song 'I Ain't Gonna Eat Out my Heart Anymore' (originally covered by the band Angel) for the [[Spiders & Snakes (band)|Spiders & Snakes]] 2014 album release 'The Year of the Snake', and stepped in temporarily replacing bassist Phil St. Vincent for several live shows until Vincent returned.\n\nFox also left his his endorsement deal as an artist endorsing the [[GHS (strings)|GHS]] company, and currently has switched to promoting the [[DR (strings)|DR]] brand of bass strings, and, has although finally become the owner of a white neck-thru-body [[Epiphone]] Thunderbird-IV\u2122 bass, Fox has signed a deal to endorse the [[Esola]] Custom Guitar Company which will be making his own signature Rik Fox \"Thunder Eagle\u2122\"(c) model bass. This will join his promotion and usage of the [[EMG]] bass pickups and [[Babicz]] custom bass bridge. Already being a published writer, (based on the entertainment value seen in his many online interviews and adventures), public demand has motivated Fox to pen his own biography, currently in the works, which promises to be a real catharsis of sorts. Fox is also writing a book on his creation and introduction of the winged hussars' representation in America. Rik Fox is re-entering the music scene making a comeback and, continues to give interviews and currently, is enjoying a resurgence in popularity and in contact with his friends and international fans in Facebook where many facets of his background can be seen there.\n\nFox is also a graduate and active member of [[Community Emergency Response Team]] (CERT), which is an Emergency Management Services augmentation support organization under the Los Angeles City and County Fire Department and [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA). He also holds a FEMA certificate and four completion certificates from the St. Petersburg College - Southeastern Public Safety Institute - Multijurisdictional Counterdrug Task Force. Additionally, Fox is a licensed Security Officer, and a licensed Ham Radio operator, call-sign KM6CDJ. \n\n==Discography==\nRik Fox Discography / Credits\n\nWith the Martian Rock Band \n* 1975: New York City, N.Y.

He was active mainly during the 1970s and 1980s, in the New York City and Hollywood area [[rock music|rock]] and metal scenes. \n\n==Early life==\nFox was born in [[Amityville, New York]], on [[Long Island]], and raised in the [[Poland|Polish]] neighborhood of [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]]. While in high school, Fox was interested in [[rock music]] and [[photography]], choosing as his subjects, the flashy personalities of the [[New York City]] [[glam rock|glam]] scene of the early 1970s. Among many other famous New York City bands performing on the city's club scene at such famous locales as [[Max's Kansas City]] and [[CBGB]] (clubs he would also later perform in with a group he joined during the height of the New York City club scene marking his professional debut on Halloween in 1975 at Max's, [[The Martian Rock Band (band)|the Martian Rock Band]]), he also photographed early [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. During this period, he dated a younger sister of original Kiss drummer [[Peter Criss]]. Fox and Criss became friends and Fox witnessed the formation of legendary rock band KISS from the very beginning, including the addition of lead guitarist [[Ace Frehley]]. During his formative club band years, after establishing himself on the 'scene', with [[The Martian Rock Band (band)|the Martian Rock Band]] and performing at the famed NYC club [[Max's Kansas City]] and [[CBGB]], in 1976, Fox found himself joining a well-established New Jersey glam-heavy club band making the rounds named Virgin. Virgin eventually became known as [[Sin (band)|Sin]] upon Fox's suggested band name change. From the band's biography: \"SIN was originally formed in New York/New Jersey in 1976 -77, coming out of the ashes of New Jersey club circuit bands VIRGIN and LUST, with the name SIN first being coined by bassist Rik Fox, bringing with him, drummer Basil Stanley (Stan Bassel from Long Island), joining Ian Criss and Keith (Vinny Matthews) Starz. In this line-up the band performed until 1978-79, when Criss left to join another band called Angelface. Fox retained the rights to the name SIN and, after moving to L.A. in 1982 to join Sister and name the heavy metal band [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]. After departing W.A.S.P., Fox networked around L.A. and eventually rehearsed for a short time with both [[Warlord (band)|Warlord]] and [[Hellion (band)|Hellion]] (although never recording or performing live with either band), eventually joining [[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]]<ref name=\"wikipedia1\">[[Steeler (American album)]] {{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref> for one album and after leaving [[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]],<ref name=\"wikipedia1\"/>  with now-proven club-drawing power, reformed two Los Angeles versions of SIN once again.\"\n\n==Career==\n===W.A.S.P.===\nAfter moving to [[Los Angeles, California]], at the invitation of Blackie Lawless, and arriving on February 4, 1982, Fox played bass-guitar in several bands, including [[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]], Sin, and W.A.S.P.. Although the band was called Sister upon his arrival, relatively speaking, he was only associated with W.A.S.P. for four months, February 1982-the end of May, 1982), and recorded a 'live' three-track cassette demo. He came up with the name \"W.A.S.P.\", (there were no periods in the band name at this time\u2014which was validated in an interview by former W.A.S.P. guitarist [[Randy Piper]]). The idea is said to have occurred to him after he stepped on a [[wasp]] in the courtyard of the house where he lived with band leader [[Blackie Lawless]]. The story of W.A.S.P. is retold in the books ''Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal'' by [[David Konow]], and \"W.A.S.P.; A Sting in the Tale\" by [[Darren P. Upton]], As stated, this is confirmed by W.A.S.P. guitarist [[Randy Piper]] at a time of Piper's height of drug and alcohol abuse, as well as in several online interviews with him.<ref>[http://www.fullinbloommusic.com/randy_piper.html Randy Piper Interview]</ref> On the other hand, some who witnessed the formation of W.A.S.P. explain that Rik Fox participated in the band after drummer [[Tony Richards]] showed up in the scene; according to Richards, the name was not [[Circus Circus (band)|Circus Circus]] when he joined the band.<ref>[http://www.fullinbloommusic.com/Tony_Richards_WASP.html Tony Richards Interview]</ref> Fox contends that to his recollection, the band was named [[Sister (band)|Sister]] when he joined.  Lawless has since begrudgingly confirmed that Rik Fox had indeed, been a band member but, 'only for a couple of rehearsals', which may not be entirely accurate, since Fox spent some 4 months rehearsing and writing with the band. Fox is also shown in early band photographs taken by Don Adkins Jr. during the band's first photo session. Causing a firestorm of controversy thirty years later after the fact, despite the grumblings by some die-hard W.A.S.P. fans desperately attempting to re-write a revisionist history of the band, it should be submitted for consideration that, since Fox created the bands' name while he was, in fact, an early co-founding band member, at that moment of the creation of it becoming the band now-known as W.A.S.P., technically speaking, no matter what happened to the band after Fox left, that historic point still qualifies him as an original founding member along with Lawless, Piper and Richards. \n\nAll this, has been verified and validated by former W.A.S.P. guitarist Chris Holmes who has stated he agrees to all of the information as being true.\n \t\nMany unverified allegations usually follow band membership changes, and Fox was no stranger to that. Both Lawless and Richards' narrative, allege that \"Rik Fox couldn't do it in the band, his playing was just not right\", so they \"let him go in a very short period of time.\" Which comes off as plausible, only because of Lawless's career being much stronger. However, Fox's bass tracks, found on the now rare, collectible live, 'original' W.A.S.P. 3-track demo recorded at Pipers' studio tell a very different story; showing a very solid and melodic bass style by Fox and how much Lawless' narrative was apparently incorrectly misinforming the public. Further, it should also be considered that since it is widely recognized that 'power associates itself with power', it is abundantly clear that if Fox had moved on to a larger successful career, that, thirty years later, nobody would bother attempting to dismiss or dispute his membership in W.A.S.P.; it would have obviously been openly acknowledged by Lawless. Case in point; New York City guitarist Ivan Kral co-founded the band Blondie and left before the band's first album, similar to Fox's relation to W.A.S.P. Nobody contends or disputes that point, but for Fox's situation, such is the case of being denied membership or credit in the band's history. Furthermore, the question has been put forth in many interviews: \"What would W.A.S.P. have been called, if not for Fox's membership in that first original line-up and suggestion in the first place?\" <ref>http://www.fullinbloommusic.com/Tony_Richards_WASP.html 'Full in Bloom Music' interview with Tony Richards</ref>\n\n===Steeler===\nAfter leaving W.A.S.P., Fox spent a short time rehearsing briefly with both [[Warlord (band)|Warlord]]  and [[Hellion (band)|Hellion]], and then joined the [[Ron Keel]] fronted band [[Steeler (American band)|Steeler]]<ref name=\"wikipedia1\"/> in 1983. He'd put an ad in a Los Angeles music magazine looking for a gig and got a call from Keel himself. Fox auditioned for Steeler and was offered the job, but before he'd accepted it, he was offered the bassist duties in the band Angel by keyboardist [[Greg Giuffria]]. Fox had a bit of a dilemma, being tempted by Giuffria's offer since [[Angel (band)|Angel]] was his 'dream band'. After considering both offers, Fox decided to join the hot, up and coming Steeler. Fox spent five months in Steeler, long enough to record the self-titled album and play some amazing gigs before being unceremoniously let go from the band. This apparently happened to many musicians in L.A. at the time, known for its 'revolving door' with many players constantly switching membership in bands. The decision to release Fox was apparently made by Keel and drummer Mark Edwards (who was responsible for informing Fox) for 'unspecified reasons', and caught Fox completely by surprise. Considering that the band was gaining huge momentum and doing well, this move confused both Fox and the fans, with Steeler changing line-ups twice more again within several months before finally becoming the band [[Keel (band)|Keel]]. According to Fox, Edwards has since spoken with him in 2009 and stated that he \"regretted the way the dissolution of the album line-up occurred\", further stating that \"had that line-up been able to stay together, that a major label signing would definitely have been forthcoming, and the band would have moved to the next plateau of national and international success.\" Fox actually received more mileage from his time with Steeler after his tenure with W.A.S.P., and contends that Steeler \"was one of the seminal cornerstones of the Hollywood rock scene in the early 1980s.\" This laid the groundwork that was integral for many of the bands yet to follow, such as [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] and [[Guns N' Roses]], just as the [[MTV]] era was being introduced to rock music fans. At the time of the original membership change, after Fox's membership was confirmed, Steeler acquired the services of a young, up-an-coming Swedish guitar-whiz virtuoso named [[Yngwie J. Malmsteen]], which gave the band some much-garnered attention, selling out venues and opening for the likes of [[Hughes/Thrall]], [[Vandenberg (band)|Vandenberg]], and [[Quiet Riot]] at a high point in their respective careers. Unfortunately, Steeler changed their line-up several more times before calling it quits, with [[Ron Keel]] eventually forming KEEL under his surname [[Keel (band)|Keel]].\n \nIn addition to the 'classic' Steeler debut album, two more Steeler releases have surfaced over the years in the Steeler legacy: ''[[Steeler; Excited '83]]'' (Perkins Palace, Pasadena, CA, USA, supporting [[Quiet Riot]]- a rare, excellent quality, live, collectors bootleg), and the Ron Keel released ''[[Metal Generation: The Steeler Anthology]]''. Rik Fox appears on all three albums. There are also several YouTube live bootleg Steeler performances recorded off the 'board mix' showing how talented as musicians this band really was. With show host [[Eddie Trunk]] admittedly being a big fan of Steelers' (small by comparison but equally integral) contribution to heavy metal music history, the question on the minds of the fans of [[That Metal Show]], is the oversight, 'while Yngwie Malmsteen has been a guest of the show several times, why then, has Steeler (as a band-together) been denied consideration as guests?' *Updated note: May 10th, 2019 saw a long-awaited Steeler reunion during the [[KEELFEST]] concert event held at the Alrosa Villa club in Columbus, Ohio, featuring legendary guitarist [[Mitch Perry]]. \n\n===Going solo with SIN===\nMeanwhile, after leaving Steeler, Fox was now 'on the map' and had a bankable reputation and sizable following, enough to now attempt to sell out clubs on his name alone. And so, Fox re-founded the band [[SIN (band)|SIN]]. (This happened when he formed a band and referred back to the band name he used back in his New Jersey club days going back to 1977-SIN). Fox's first L.A. line-up began to sell out clubs rapidly drawing attention, following on the heels of his popular notoriety from Steeler. However, within six months, despite recording and releasing a 'heavy' Angel-meets Judas Priest sounding, now-rare, snake-shaped collectors' picture disc single of the Fox/Drossin penned \"On the Run\" backed with \"Captured in Time\", disagreements erupted over a potential new band management direction that Fox questioned, which resulted in the previously unknown band members beginning to publicly entertain ideas of stealing the SIN band name and kicking Fox out of his own band and replace him. Things came to a head during recording what would have been their first album when, after apologizing to the producer of these sessions, [[Bill Metoyer]], Fox stormed out of the session. Wasting no time, Fox quickly re-formed another line up using three newly relocated members of the New York band, Mongol Horde recording artists [[Alien (band)|Alien]],<ref>{{cite web|author=US |url=https://www.myspace.com/alienrockband/ |title=Alien &#124; Free Music, Tour Dates, Photos, Videos |publisher=Myspace.com |date=2008-09-21 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleazegrinder.net/2012/01/flash-metal-suicide-alien.html/ |accessdate=December 22, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> who had recently disbanded in New York, contacted Fox and came to Los Angeles to join him in reforming a new line-up of SIN. This line-up enjoyed some well-noticed success, and outstandingly outdid his previous band's accomplishments, finding themselves being voted in a Los Angeles music magazine's fans poll for 'The top drawing rock/metal band cumulative for 1984 over Keel, Stryper and Odin.' \nThey headlined in dozens of packed-house concerts and shows, including the annual '[[Los Angeles Street Scene]]' before some 5,000 people. This line-up of Sin also co-headlined a show with Christian metal band [[Stryper]] and directly supported a show with his former Steeler bandmate band Ron Keel's band [[Keel (band)|Keel]].\n\nDoors were now opening for Fox and SIN. After being approached and picked up by Jerry Weintraub's 'Management 3' in Beverly Hills, Fox was 'advised' (coerced) to replace vocalist Frank C. Starr (see [[The Four Horsemen (band)|The Four Horsemen]]) and drummer Mark Anthony Benquechea who were replaced by musicians of producer Dana Strum's choosing and, with singer [[Mark Slaughter]] singing the tracking vocals they entered Encore Studios in 1985 to record album master demos, being produced by [[Vinnie Vincent]] bassist [[Dana Strum]] (who also produced among other L.A. bands, the band [[Burn (American band)|Burn]]). Showing promise, SIN now began receiving attention from the major record labels. However, despite Fox trying desperately to keep it together, misfortune struck again and the band's internal chemistry and Management issues caused Fox to disband Sin which then fell apart. To add insult to injury, producer Strum then openly violated copyright laws by handing over Fox' song \"On the Run\" to Vincent Vincent who changed the lyrics and re-recorded it as \"Let Freedom Rock\" for his own album ''[[All Systems Go (Vinnie Vincent Invasion album)]]''. When Fox attempted to sue, Strum threatened with a counter-suit to 'bleed Fox dry' and then following, Vincent claimed bankruptcy. (See also, the Number 1 fan -voted Decibel Geek Podcast episode: http://dbgeekshow.blogspot.com/2011/07/vinnie-vincent-special-part-1.html ).\n\n===New band life - Burn and Surgical Steel===\nUpon the break-up of Sin, Fox was quickly approached by [[Niji Management|Niji]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/nijientertainmentgroup |title=Niji Entertainment Group |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref> Management (associated with Wendy Dio, wife of [[Ronnie James Dio|Ronnie James]])'s band [[Burn (American band)|Burn]] (formerly Hellion), who shared the same producer ([[Dana Strum]]), and was accepted into the band, spending several months rehearsing with them in 1986. Shortly after, the band eventually dismissed their singer, Richard Parico. Fox then approached a fellow New Yorker, former [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] lead singer [[Neil Turbin]] to offer him the gig, which Turbin turned down in favor of his own project. During a break in rehearsals, Fox flew to Arizona to scout potential gigs for Burn. At a Loudness concert there, he was approached to join Arizona heavy metal band [[Surgical Steel (band)|Surgical Steel]], (a band formerly fronted by [[Jeff Martin (American musician)|Jeff Martin]] later in [[Badlands (American band)|Badlands]] and [[Racer X (band)|Racer X]], and featuring [[Judas Priest]] frontman [[Rob Halford]] on one of their demos). This meeting led to spending several months performing and recording an album with them and supporting the [[Lita Ford]] band for a 1987 New Year's Eve concert. Unfortunately, misfortune struck again when Surgical Steel's financial backing fell through to finish the album, and the recording deal fell through leaving the album unfinished. Fox eventually left the band, returning to Hollywood, (with apparently no 'playing issues' at fault claimed there, either). Fox had successfully recorded with [[Dokken]] drummer [[Mick Brown (musician)]] for the Surgical Steel sessions. Fox stated in his interviews that \"this pattern of bad luck began to take on the appearance of his developing a penchant for joining popular name bands that, despite looking very promising going in, were, in effect, already sinking ships... it began to look like I couldn't stay with a band for very long, which, despite outward appearances, as anyone can easily see, was not the case, since they fell part on their own soon after I left them and I had moved on to other ventures.\"\n\nHowever, in the waning years of the 1980s, Rik Fox has had the good fortune to have shared the stage and performed with some of Rock's Legends, including the late [[Ronnie James Dio]] and rock comedian [[Sam Kinison]], [[Little Steven]], Ozzy Osbourne drummer [[Randy Castillo]], as well as Kiss guitarist [[Mark St. John]], and Bruce Springsteen's drummer, \u2018Mighty\u2019 [[Max Weinberg]], (in the late 1970s),  Roseanne's [[John Goodman]], producer [[Jean Beauvoir]], as well as the band [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]] and [[Guns N' Roses]], among others at various all-star jams, or, jamming with the likes of Steppenwolf's legendary guitarist [[Michael Monarch]].\n\n===1990s===\nNot one to stand still, despite some mistaken rumors being circulated that Fox has 'not done anything significant since he left Steeler', nothing could be further from the truth; Fox's music career may have taken a slight turn, but never entirely ended. After he abandoned his last popular band, [[Thunderball (band)|Thunderball]], and then Flyboyz, in the early 1990s. He abandoned his 'pretty-boy look' and played in a local, low-key Hollywood band [[Wiseguys]], (not 'The Wiseguys'), radically camouflaging himself into a rather incognito image that better fit the band [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], than the more Glam-looking bands he created or performed with. Seeing the writing on the wall, with the arena styled rock music of the 1980s being phased out in the 1990s, many musicians began to look elsewhere for employment to survive, and so, Fox began to broaden his horizons and take a personal break from music for a while, and try some new ventures.\n\n===New interests===\nAfter having served five years in the [[California State Military Reserve]]<ref>[[California State Military Reserve]]</ref> (which is a lower civilian branch of the U.S. Army), as a radio operator/communications NCO with the rank of E4 (Corporal), his interest moved on in all things military, which brought him to working in the film industry as an assistant [[property master]], and weapons handler, working on some direct-to-video lower budget films and on the Network syndicated television series ''[[Air America (TV series)|Air America]]'', featuring [[Lorenzo Lamas]], and the late [[Scott Plank]], with whom Fox became close friends. Fox also dabbled in acting and took several film roles. He worked on the film 'Surface to Air' with [[Chad McQueen]], [[Melanie Shatner]], and [[Michael Madsen]]. Fox acted briefly on the television soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]'', acting directly with series anchor 'Luke'-[[Anthony Geary]]. Rik was also one of the featured interview subjects for the VH-1 Cable series 'Driven' for the episode \"The Rise of [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]]\" being a close friend of [[Nikki Sixx]] and the band, and recommended to VH-1 producers by former Hollywood booking agent [[Vicky Hamilton (music executive)]]. Rik is also remembered as one of the featured interview subjects for the legendary Rock film parody, [[The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years]] by friend and director [[Penelope Spheeris]].\n\n====Renaissance and living history/re-enactment pioneer====\nThrough acting, he eventually became involved with the [[Renaissance Faire]] scene, and military timeline events such as the Old Fort MacArthur Days<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortmacarthur.tripod.com/ |title=Old Fort MacArthur Days |publisher=Fortmacarthur.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref> where he actively sought and succeeded to bring the noticeably absent Polish 17th century military history into the forefront. Fox has been referred to by many Polish media correspondents and others as a 'recognized pioneer' in this venture, of creating the first representation in the U.S., of the Polish winged hussar cavalry of central Europe which, apparently, is a part of his ancestry. Polish 17th century military author Bartosz Musialowicz had interviewed him and written an article about Rik, dubbing him with the honorary title of 'The First Saber of the U.S.' for founding and creating the first officially recognized representation of the Polish winged hussar cavalry in American History.  Apart from being an internationally recognized rock musician, it is of interest to note that Rik is the first Polish-American of Polish noble (not 'royal') ancestry, to 'formally', represent the [[Polish Hussars|Polish Winged Hussar]] cavalry in U.S. history.

He then stepped aside a second-term for family-related reasons.\n\n===Back to music and the Winged Hussars===\nFox is also involved in co-promotion of the European and Japanese market release of ''The Steeler Anthology'' with former bandmate [[Ron Keel]]. A discussion of a possible Steeler reunion performance has been left open-ended so far.<ref>{{cite web|last=Parks |first=John |url=http://www.legendaryrockinterviews.com/2011/12/18/legendary-rock-interview-with-rik-fox-ex-w-a-s-p-steeler-and-sin/ |title=Legendary Rock Interview with Rik Fox (ex- W.A.S.P., STEELER and SIN) |publisher=Legendary Rock Interviews |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref>\nAlthough he has not left the music field entirely, broadening his horizons, in recent years, Fox has taken a new interest in learning the field of [[natural horsemanship]] through his wife Tamara, (married on October 1, 2009 in a small private ceremony), and they train their (rescued) horses, while he continues to work on his pursuit of raising Polish historical awareness and culture and military history with their winged hussar group. Fox, today, is also making a comeback in music. Through Shrapnel Records producer [[Mike Varney]], Fox has recently re-connected with fellow Steeler bandmate and drummer Mark Edwards.\n\nRenewed interest is being shown to Steeler, by [[DJ Shadow]], who expressed interest in using some of Steeler's music for a new project, which will possibly revive an interest in Steeler once again for the next 'Metal Generation' to come as well as previous fans who still listen to their classic album. Rik Fox was interviewed in the 2011 book release ''W.A.S.P.; A Sting in the Tale'' by author [[Darren P. Upton]], and asked to share his input on the early days of the band's creation of which he is now known to have been an original founding member of.\n\nFox was also featured in three more book releases. The first book which will feature Fox, is by NPR personality Charlie Schroeder, titled ''Man of War'', regarding Schroeder's Walter Mitty-like embedded experiences of participating with various re-enactments of warriors of military history to see and experience what it was like to be those historical warriors. Among the many historical impressions in the book, Schroeder spent a day with Fox's Polish Winged Hussar living history group fully suited up in the famous winged armor. In the meantime, The second book, by KISS author Ken Sharp for the ''New York Times'' bestseller ''Nothing to Lose'' regarding the band [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] in their formative years, of which Fox was an active part. The book features various first-hand historical anecdotes and exclusive early live photos contributed by Fox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lovelylaurahardrockradiolive.podomatic.com/entry/2012-02-13T16_56_30-08_00 |title=PodOmatic &#124; Best Free Podcasts |publisher=Lovelylaurahardrockradiolive.podomatic.com |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://themetalreview.com/?p=3189 |accessdate=March 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714112953/http://themetalreview.com/?p=3189 |archivedate=July 14, 2015 }}</ref>\nRik Fox is also slated to be among the featured popular performers in the upcoming coffee table book 'Lost Rockers' scheduled for a 2015 publication release. The third book, by historian Miltiades Varvounis, titled ''Made in Poland: The Women and Men Who Changed the World'', in which Rik Fox was included among author's list of the 100 most influential Polish people that changed the world.\n\nIn promoting his ancestral noble Polish heritage, Rik was featured as a 17th-century Polish winged hussar cavalry-knight figure in the Documentary film \"[[Path to Glory; The Rise and Rise of the Polish Arabian Horse]]\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pathtogloryfilm.com/About.html |title=Path to Glory The Rise and Rise of the Polish Arabian Horse |publisher=Pathtogloryfilm.com |accessdate=2013-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020234720/http://pathtogloryfilm.com/About.html |archive-date=2013-10-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as well as having been the featured subject in 2013, for the (Canadian) History Channel cable television series [[Museum Secrets]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsecrets.tv/ |title=Museum Secrets |publisher=Museumsecrets.tv |date= |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref> (Kensington Productions), which selects various curious topics of history and expounds upon them. In Rik's case, for the episode dealing with the Moscow State Museum in Russia, and a suit of Polish winged armor on display there, the director and producer sought him out because, in the words of the segment producer: 'of all his active research on the subject and what he has brought to the table with regard to his being the most highly visible contributions of promoting the winged hussars and Polish history in the United States.' The episode dedicated to the winged hussars for Season Three is considered ground-breaking for finally producing valuable information being made available to the mainstream public in the English-language on the winged hussars, which was a major accomplishment and a dream come true for Fox.\n\nIn addition to returning to music or reform another band line-up, Rik Fox has also recorded bass tracks for the re-make Rascal's song 'I Ain't Gonna Eat Out my Heart Anymore' (originally covered by the band Angel) for the [[Spiders & Snakes (band)|Spiders & Snakes]] 2014 album release 'The Year of the Snake', and stepped in temporarily replacing bassist Phil St. Vincent for several live shows until Vincent returned.\n\nFox also left his his endorsement deal as an artist endorsing the [[GHS (strings)|GHS]] company, and currently has switched to promoting the [[DR (strings)|DR]] brand of bass strings, and, has although finally become the owner of a white neck-thru-body [[Epiphone]] Thunderbird-IV\u2122 bass, Fox has signed a deal to endorse the [[Esola]] Custom Guitar Company which will be making his own signature Rik Fox \"Thunder Eagle\u2122\"(c) model bass. This will join his promotion and usage of the [[EMG]] bass pickups and [[Babicz]] custom bass bridge. Already being a published writer, (based on the entertainment value seen in his many online interviews and adventures), public demand has motivated Fox to pen his own biography, currently in the works, which promises to be a real catharsis of sorts. Fox is also writing a book on his creation and introduction of the winged hussars' representation in America. Rik Fox is re-entering the music scene making a comeback and, continues to give interviews and currently, is enjoying a resurgence in popularity and in contact with his friends and international fans in Facebook where many facets of his background can be seen there.\n\nFox is also a graduate and active member of [[Community Emergency Response Team]] (CERT), which is an Emergency Management Services augmentation support organization under the Los Angeles City and County Fire Department and [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA). He also holds a FEMA certificate and four completion certificates from the St. Petersburg College - Southeastern Public Safety Institute - Multijurisdictional Counterdrug Task Force. Additionally, Fox is a licensed Security Officer, and a licensed Ham Radio operator, call-sign KM6CDJ. \n\n==Discography==\nRik Fox Discography / Credits\n\nWith the Martian Rock Band \n* 1975: New York City, N.Y.

Aircraft used included the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] bomber and\u2014from 1956\u2014the [[Lockheed U-2]] spy plane specifically designed for high-altitude reconnaissance flight. The overflight program was ended following the [[1960 U-2 incident]].\n\n==Background==\nReconnaissance flights began in 1946 along the borders of the Soviet Union and other [[Eastern Bloc]] states. The necessity of peacetime overflights was reinforced after the escalation of the [[Cold War]] in the late 1940s, and in particular after the [[Korean War]] began in 1950. U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] authorized selected overflights of the Soviet Union in order to determine the status of its air forces. It was feared that the Soviets might launch a surprise aerial attack on the United States with long-range bombers.<ref name=Natola/>{{rp|91\u201392}}\n[[File:Boeing RB-47E Stratojet 050421-F-1234P-009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|RB-47E]] reconnaissance bomber, mid-1950s]]\n\n==Cross-border droppings==\nOn several occasions in 1951-1952, CIA planes flew over the Soviet territory, penetrating the airspace near the borders of its westernmost republics ([[Moldovan SSR]], [[Ukrainian SSR]], and [[Belarussian SSR]],) dropping parachutist agents recruited in the West from the [[Soviet defectors]] (the AEDEPOT project.) Most of the landed agents were captured by the Soviet troops and government agencies. The agents were disguised as ordinary Soviet citizens, and equipped with fake [[Soviet passport]]s, guns, greandes, explosives, [[pen gun|disguised firing devices]], and other spy equipment. They were detailed to contact local anti-Soviet rebels, and engage in a [[guerrilla warfare]] against the local Soviet authorities.<ref>''Dozornye zapadnyh rubezhey: dokumental'nye ocherki po istorii voysk Krasnoznamyonnogo Zapadnogo pogranichnogo okruga'' (in Russian).

Eisenhower]] approved a secret program under the direction of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] to build and fly a special-purpose high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft with the code name  AQUATONE. [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] was chosen to build the reconnaissance plane and in August 1955 the first [[Lockheed U-2]] was [[Maiden flight|test-flown]].\n\nOther strategic reconnaissance missions continued as the U-2 tests were ongoing. In early 1956 [[Project Genetrix]] involved hundreds of high-altitude photographic reconnaissance [[balloon]]s that were intended to collect intelligence as they drifted across the Soviet Union; only 51 balloons were recovered, however and just 31 of those provided any usable photos.\n\nDuring [[Project HOMERUN]] (between March and May 1956) RB-47E reconnaissance aircraft flew almost daily flights over the [[North Pole]] to photograph and gather electronic intelligence over the entire northern section of the Soviet Union.\n\nOn 6 May 1956 six reconnaissance bombers, [[Formation flying|flying abreast]], crossed the North Pole and penetrated Soviet airspace in broad daylight as if on a nuclear bombing run. Any Soviet radar operator seeing the bombers would have no way of knowing that the mission was an act of espionage and not of war.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120101112547/http://www.allbusiness.com/buying_exiting_businesses/3580596-1.html</ref>\n\nOn 4 July 1956 the first U-2 flight over the Soviet Union took place. Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] angrily protested this overflight and feared that \"when they understand that we are defenseless against an aerial attack, it will push the Americans to begin the war earlier.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Burrows|first=William E.|title=This new ocean : a history of the first space age.|year=1999|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0-375-75485-7|edition=1st paperback}}</ref> This prompted the Soviet Union to develop new air defense systems.\n\nStrategic overflight reconnaissance in peacetime became routine U.S. policy. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s Project [[Lockheed A-12|OXCART]], an aircraft which flew even higher and four times faster than the U-2, advanced aerial overflight reconnaissance capabilities with eventual development of the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird]].\n\n==Discontinuance==\nFollowing the [[1960 U-2 incident]], Eisenhower ordered an end to American reconnaissance flights into the [[Soviet Union]].  This policy was upheld by [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]. On 25 January 1961 he told a press conference, \"I have ordered that the flights not be resumed, which is a continuation of the order given by President Eisenhower in May of last year.\"<ref name=\"cia-or\">Pedlow, Gregory W. and Welzenbach, Donald E., [http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/DOC_0000190094.pdf 'The Central Intelligence Agency and Overhead Reconnaissance; The U-2 And Oxcart Programs, 1954-1974'], Central Intelligence Agency History Staff, 1992.

Aircraft used included the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] bomber and\u2014from 1956\u2014the [[Lockheed U-2]] spy plane specifically designed for high-altitude reconnaissance flight. The overflight program was ended following the [[1960 U-2 incident]].\n\n==Background==\nReconnaissance flights began in 1946 along the borders of the Soviet Union and other [[Eastern Bloc]] states. The necessity of peacetime overflights was reinforced after the escalation of the [[Cold War]] in the late 1940s, and in particular after the [[Korean War]] began in 1950. U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] authorized selected overflights of the Soviet Union in order to determine the status of its air forces. It was feared that the Soviets might launch a surprise aerial attack on the United States with long-range bombers.<ref name=Natola/>{{rp|91\u201392}}\n[[File:Boeing RB-47E Stratojet 050421-F-1234P-009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|RB-47E]] reconnaissance bomber, mid-1950s]]\n\n==Cross-border droppings==\nOn several occasions in 1951-1952, CIA planes flew over the Soviet territory, penetrating the airspace near the borders of its westernmost republics ([[Moldovan SSR]], [[Ukrainian SSR]], and [[Belarussian SSR]],) dropping parachutist agents recruited in the West from the [[Soviet defectors]] (the AEDEPOT project.) Most of the landed agents were captured by the Soviet troops and government agencies. The agents were disguised as ordinary Soviet citizens, and equipped with fake [[Soviet passport]]s, guns, greandes, explosives, [[pen gun|disguised firing devices]], and other spy equipment.
