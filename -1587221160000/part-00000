This first look at St Mary Mead led a reviewer in 1990 to ask why these are called cosy mysteries: \"Our first glimpse of St Mary Mead, a hotbed of burglary, impersonation, adultery and ultimately murder. What is it precisely that people find so cosy about such stories?\"<ref name=Barnard1990 />\n\nThe character had previously appeared in [[short stories]] published in magazines starting in December 1927. These earlier stories were collected in book form in ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' in 1932.\n\n==Plot summary==\nColonel Lucius Protheroe is wealthy, active in the church and a magistrate. Yet almost no one in his village, St Mary Mead, likes him; the vicar, Rev. Leonard Clement, endures his public insults while setting up an evening meeting to discuss irregularities in the accounts, and Protheroe's 16 year old daughter Lettice cannot bear him. Both express a wish for him to die, out of frustration with him. Clement sees Mrs Anne Protheroe in tight embrace with Lawrence Redding, clearly tired of her husband. That evening, the Colonel is found murdered in the Vicar's study.\n\nVicar Clement is called away to a home two miles distant. He walks there and back, learning that they had not called him. He is late for the meeting with Protheroe, set for 6:15 pm. He meets Redding, who is leaving the vicarage. Upon entering the study, he finds Protheroe bent over at the desk, shot in the head, dead. He calls Dr Haydock, who arrives at 6:55 and estimates time of death as 30 minutes earlier. Dr Haydock calls the police. A note is found beneath the corpse, along with the Vicar's clock. The note is marked with a time of 6:20 pm and the clock is set to 6:22. The note is odd, saying I can no longer wait for you, though it was made clear to Protheroe upon his arrival that the vicar would not arrive before 6:30 and Protheroe seemed perfectly willing to wait at the time.\n \nNews spreads quickly in St Mary Mead. No one, including Miss Jane Marple outdoors in her garden, hears a shot from the study. Several in the village did hear an odd sort of shot from the woods, but later than 6:25. Inspector Slack and Chief Constable Melchett arrive to inspect the scene and search for clues. The inspector is thorough, but not quite as thorough as Miss Marple in gathering information and making sense of it. The Inspector scorns the older women in the village, single or widowed, despite their observant ways. Rather soon, two people confess to the murder. Lawrence Redding, the artist who uses a building on the vicarage property as his studio, confesses to the crime. The police do not believe him. Next, Mrs Anne Protheroe confesses to committing the murder. Nor is she believed, because others saw her outdoors. Other possible suspects include Archer, a man treated harshly by Protheroe for poaching; Mrs Lestrange, who appeared recently in the village and sees only Dr Haydock. The other outsider is Dr Stone, an archaeologist and his assistant, Gladys Cram, who are working at a site on the Protheroe estate. Miss Marple has a list of seven in her mind.\n\nMiss Marple sees Miss Cram carrying a suitcase into the woods at midnight, and Clement later finds the suitcase. Miss Marple's nephew Raymond West has met Stone and does not recognize the man claiming to be him. In the suitcase is valuable silver belonging to the Protheroes. Slack learns that Stone is not an archeologist but a thief with a long record.\n \nMiss Marple compares people in new situations with people she has observed in village life, and then thinks out what is really happening, never relying of what people say, but on what she can verify. The Vicar respects her intelligence. Clement is interested to find the murderer, as is Miss Marple, as are the police. The police send the note to a specialist, who says that it was not written by Protheroe.\n\nMelchett shares this news with Clement. Clement and Melchett proceed to Curate Hawes\u2019 rooms because of a phone call of confession. Hawes is barely alive, and has received the actual note written by Protheroe from Redding on the previous evening, which accuses Hawes of stealing funds from the church. Dr Haydock saves Hawes' life; Redding had substituted a dangerous drug in place of the usual medication, hoping Hawes, dead, would appear as the murderer, and that is what Melchett and Clement believe. Miss Marple arrives at Hawes' rooms, because the local phone operator first mistakenly connects Melchett's call to Haydock to her phone before making the connection correctly. She is glad that Hawes will survive and then explains who the murderer is. Melchett is unwilling to believe her; at the end, he knows she is right. No one heard a shot because a silencer was used on the pistol owned by Redding. Redding places the pistol with silencer in a potted plant when he visits Clement earlier in the afternoon. Anne Protheroe then shoots her husband at 6:25 after walking past Miss Marple and showing how she carried no purse, no gun. Then Anne meets up with Redding, and both are seen in public by 6:30 pm. Redding returns to the vicarage just before Clement returns, removing the pistol and actual note, and placing the misleading note. Miss Marple sees Redding as a handsome man with many talents, and ruthless, wanting marriage only with a wife who brought wealth. A hint is dropped that someone saw Redding switch the medication for poor Hawes. Redding met with Anne at night outside her home, where the police overheard their conversation and used the facts to bring the pair to trial.\n \nLettice explains that Mrs Lestrange is her mother, the first wife of Protheroe, who deserted him. She is mortally ill and wants to be near her daughter.\n\n==Characters==\n\n* [[Miss Marple]]: Spinster living in [[St. Mary Mead|St Mary Mead]], next to the vicar.

A later review finds the story more to the taste of 1990, and likes the village and its people. The author, looking back on her own work in her autobiography in the 1970s, thought her main plot \"sound\", but perhaps there were too many characters and subplots.\n\nThe ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' of 6 November 1930 posed the various questions as to who could have killed Protheroe and why, and concluded, \"As a detective story, the only fault of this one is that it is hard to believe the culprit could kill Prothero [''[[sic]]''] so quickly and quietly. The three plans of the room, garden, and village show that almost within sight and hearing was Miss Marple, who 'always knew every single thing that happened and drew the worst inferences.' And three other 'Parish cats' (admirably portrayed) were in the next three houses. It is Miss Marple who does detect the murderer in the end, but one suspects she would have done it sooner in reality\".<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Times Literary Supplement |date=6 November 1930 |page=921 |title=Review }}</ref>\n\nThe review of the novel in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' of 30 November 1930 begins, \"The talented Miss Christie is far from being at her best in her latest mystery story. It will add little to her eminence in the field of detective fiction.\" The review went on to say that, \"the local sisterhood of spinsters is introduced with much gossip and click-clack. A bit of this goes a long way and the average reader is apt to grow weary of it all, particularly of the amiable Miss Marple, who is sleuth-in-chief of the affair.\" The reviewer summarised the set-up of the plot and concluded, \"The solution is a distinct anti-climax.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times Book Review |date=30 November 1930 |page=32 |title=Review  }}</ref>\n\nH C O'Neill in ''[[The Observer]]'' of 12 December 1930 said that, \"here is a straightforward story which very pleasantly draws a number of red herrings across the docile reader's path. There is a distinct originality in her new expedient for keeping the secret. She discloses it at the outset, turns it inside out, apparently proves that the solution cannot be true, and so produces an atmosphere of bewilderment.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Observer |date=12 December 1930 |page=6 |title=Review |last=O'Neill |first=H C }}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Daily Express]]'' of 16 October 1930 [[Harold Nicolson]] said, \"I have read better works by Agatha Christie, but that does not mean that this last book is not more cheerful, more amusing, and more seductive than the generality of detective novels.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Daily Express |date=16 October 1930 |page=6 |title=Review |first=Harold |last=Nicholson  }}</ref> In a short review dated 15 October 1930, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' review declared, \"Bafflement is well sustained.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Daily Mirror |date=15 October 1930 |page=20 |title=Review }}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Barnard]] wrote sixty years later that this is \"Our first glimpse of St Mary Mead, a hotbed of burglary, impersonation, adultery and ultimately murder. What is it precisely that people find so cosy about such stories?\" He found the resolution a bit hard to believe, yet the story is more appealing to readers of 1990 than to those in 1930. \"The solution boggles the mind somewhat, but there are too many incidental pleasures to complain, and the strong dose of vinegar in this first sketch of Miss Marple is more to modern taste than the touch of syrup in later presentations.\"<ref name=Barnard1990>{{cite book |last=Barnard |first=Robert |title=A Talent to Deceive \u2013 an appreciation of Agatha Christie |edition=Revised |page=198 |publisher=Fontana Books |year=1990 |isbn=0-00-637474-3}}</ref>\n\nChristie herself later wrote: \"Reading ''Murder at the Vicarage'' now, I am not so pleased with it as I was at the time. It has, I think, far too many characters, and too many sub-plots. But at any rate the ''main'' plot is sound.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Christie |first1=Agatha |title=Agatha Christie: An Autobiography |date=1991 |publisher=Berkley |isbn=9780425127391 |pages=422 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JuwctOkJYJQC |orig-year=1977 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn a discussion with [[J. K. Rowling|J K Rowling]] in 2014, author [[Val McDermid]] remarked that ''The Murder at the Vicarage'' is the book that got her interested in detective stories; she described the humour in that novel and said that Christie did not get enough credit for the humour in her detective mysteries. McDermid quoted from the descriptions of the four women in the village, particularly \u201cMiss Hartnell who was feared by the poor\u201d, for its humour and the terse description that conveyed so much.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TbvJbbgFhrQ |title=Val McDermid interviews JK Rowling (Robert Galbraith) at Harrogate International Festival 2014 |access-date=11 January 2020 |date=September 2014 |format=video |minutes=14-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hogwartsprofessor.com/christies-murder-at-the-vicarage-bellatrix-lestranges-debut-in-fiction/ |title=Christie\u2019s \u2018Murder at the Vicarage\u2019 Bellatrix Lestrange\u2019s Debut in Fiction? |date=21 August 2019 |access-date=11 January 2020 |work=Hogwarts Professor Thoughts and Ideas |author=John }}</ref>\n\n==Allusions in other novels==\nThe Vicar and his wife, Leonard and Griselda Clement, who made their first appearance in this novel, continue to show up in Miss Marple stories. Notably, they feature in ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (1942) along with Slack and Melchett, and ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957).\n\nThe character of Miss Marple had previously appeared in [[short stories]] published in magazines starting in December 1927. These earlier stories were collected in book form in ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' in 1932.\n\n==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==\n\n===The Murder at the Vicarage (1949 play)===\nThe story was adapted into a play by Moie Charles and [[Barbara Toy]] in 1949 and opened at the [[Playhouse Theatre]] on 16 December 1949. Miss Marple was played by [[Barbara Mullen]].\n\n{{Main|Murder at the Vicarage (play)}}\n\n===Television adaptations===\nThe [[BBC]] adapted the book into a film on 25 December 1986, with [[Joan Hickson]] as Miss Marple, [[Paul Eddington]] as the vicar, and [[Polly Adams]] as Anne Protheroe. The adaptation was generally very close to the original novel with four major exceptions: the trap which exposes the killer is changed to involve another murder attempt, the characters of Dennis, Dr. Stone, and Gladys Cram were deleted, Bill Archer is present in the kitchen while the murder takes place, and Anne commits suicide out of remorse instead of being tried.\n\nIt was presented again on the ITV series ''[[Agatha Christie's Marple]]'' by [[Granada Television]] in 2004 with [[Geraldine McEwan]] as Miss Marple, [[Tim McInnerny]] as the vicar, [[Derek Jacobi]] as Colonel Protheroe, and [[Janet McTeer]] as Anne. This version eliminates the characters of Dr. Stone and Gladys Cram, replacing them with the elderly French Professor Dufosse and his granddaughter H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\n\nOther changes include the elimination of Miss Weatherby, the changing of Mrs. Price-Ridley's first name from Martha to Marjorie, the renaming of Bill Archer to Frank Tarrent, and the addition of a plotline in which the Colonel stole 10,000 [[francs]] from the [[French Resistance]], which led to the death of an agent.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}}\n\nTwo major departures from the book are the portrayal of Miss Marple as Anne's close friend and the addition of a series of flashbacks to December 1915, when a younger Miss Marple was engaged in a forbidden love affair with a married soldier.\n\nIn both versions, the vicar's role is reduced and he does not participate in the investigation since his presence as the narrator was unnecessary in a filmed version.\n\n===Graphic novel adaptation===\n''The Murder at the Vicarage'' was released by [[HarperCollins]] as a [[graphic novel]] adaptation on 20 May 2008, adapted and illustrated by \"Norma\" (Norbert Morandi\u00e8re) ({{ISBN|0-00-727460-2}}). This was translated from the edition first published in France by [[:fr:Emmanuel Proust \u00e9ditions|Emmanuel Proust \u00e9ditions]] in 2005 under the title of ''L'Affaire Proth\u00e9roe''.\n\n==Publication history==\n* 1930, Collins Crime Club (London), October 1930, Hardcover, 256 pp\n* 1930, Dodd Mead and Company (New York), 1930, Hardcover, 319 pp\n* 1948, [[Penguin Books]], Paperback, (Penguin number 686), 255 pp\n* 1948, [[Dell Books]] (New York), Paperback, 223 pp\n* 1961, Fontana Books (Imprint of [[HarperCollins]]), Paperback, 191 pp\n* 1976, Greenway edition of collected works (William Collins), Hardcover, 251 pp, {{ISBN|0-00-231543-2}}\n* 1978, Greenway edition of collected works (Dodd Mead and Company), Hardcover, 251 pp\n* 1980, Ulverscroft Large Print Edition, Hardcover, 391 pp, {{ISBN|0-7089-0476-9}}\n* 2005, Marple Facsimile edition (Facsimile of 1930 UK first edition), 12 September 2005, Hardcover, {{ISBN|0-00-720842-1}}\n\nThe novel was first serialised in the US in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in fifty-five instalments from Monday, 18 August to Monday, 20 October 1930.\n\n===Book dedication===\nThe dedication of the book reads:<br/>\n\"To Rosalind\"\n\nThe subject of this dedication is Christie's daughter, [[Rosalind Hicks]] (1919\u20132004) who was the daughter of her first marriage to [[Archibald Christie]] (1890\u20131962) and Agatha Christie's only child.

A later review finds the story more to the taste of 1990, and likes the village and its people. The author, looking back on her own work in her autobiography in the 1970s, thought her main plot \"sound\", but perhaps there were too many characters and subplots.\n\nThe ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' of 6 November 1930 posed the various questions as to who could have killed Protheroe and why, and concluded, \"As a detective story, the only fault of this one is that it is hard to believe the culprit could kill Prothero [''[[sic]]''] so quickly and quietly. The three plans of the room, garden, and village show that almost within sight and hearing was Miss Marple, who 'always knew every single thing that happened and drew the worst inferences.' And three other 'Parish cats' (admirably portrayed) were in the next three houses. It is Miss Marple who does detect the murderer in the end, but one suspects she would have done it sooner in reality\".<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Times Literary Supplement |date=6 November 1930 |page=921 |title=Review }}</ref>\n\nThe review of the novel in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' of 30 November 1930 begins, \"The talented Miss Christie is far from being at her best in her latest mystery story. It will add little to her eminence in the field of detective fiction.\" The review went on to say that, \"the local sisterhood of spinsters is introduced with much gossip and click-clack. A bit of this goes a long way and the average reader is apt to grow weary of it all, particularly of the amiable Miss Marple, who is sleuth-in-chief of the affair.\" The reviewer summarised the set-up of the plot and concluded, \"The solution is a distinct anti-climax.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times Book Review |date=30 November 1930 |page=32 |title=Review  }}</ref>\n\nH C O'Neill in ''[[The Observer]]'' of 12 December 1930 said that, \"here is a straightforward story which very pleasantly draws a number of red herrings across the docile reader's path. There is a distinct originality in her new expedient for keeping the secret. She discloses it at the outset, turns it inside out, apparently proves that the solution cannot be true, and so produces an atmosphere of bewilderment.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Observer |date=12 December 1930 |page=6 |title=Review |last=O'Neill |first=H C }}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Daily Express]]'' of 16 October 1930 [[Harold Nicolson]] said, \"I have read better works by Agatha Christie, but that does not mean that this last book is not more cheerful, more amusing, and more seductive than the generality of detective novels.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Daily Express |date=16 October 1930 |page=6 |title=Review |first=Harold |last=Nicholson  }}</ref> In a short review dated 15 October 1930, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' review declared, \"Bafflement is well sustained.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Daily Mirror |date=15 October 1930 |page=20 |title=Review }}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Barnard]] wrote sixty years later that this is \"Our first glimpse of St Mary Mead, a hotbed of burglary, impersonation, adultery and ultimately murder. What is it precisely that people find so cosy about such stories?\" He found the resolution a bit hard to believe, yet the story is more appealing to readers of 1990 than to those in 1930. \"The solution boggles the mind somewhat, but there are too many incidental pleasures to complain, and the strong dose of vinegar in this first sketch of Miss Marple is more to modern taste than the touch of syrup in later presentations.\"<ref name=Barnard1990>{{cite book |last=Barnard |first=Robert |title=A Talent to Deceive \u2013 an appreciation of Agatha Christie |edition=Revised |page=198 |publisher=Fontana Books |year=1990 |isbn=0-00-637474-3}}</ref>\n\nChristie herself later wrote: \"Reading ''Murder at the Vicarage'' now, I am not so pleased with it as I was at the time. It has, I think, far too many characters, and too many sub-plots. But at any rate the ''main'' plot is sound.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Christie |first1=Agatha |title=Agatha Christie: An Autobiography |date=1991 |publisher=Berkley |isbn=9780425127391 |pages=422 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JuwctOkJYJQC |orig-year=1977 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn a discussion with [[J. K. Rowling|J K Rowling]] in 2014, author [[Val McDermid]] remarked that ''The Murder at the Vicarage'' is the book that got her interested in detective stories; she described the humour in that novel and said that Christie did not get enough credit for the humour in her detective mysteries. McDermid quoted from the descriptions of the four women in the village, particularly \u201cMiss Hartnell who was feared by the poor\u201d, for its humour and the terse description that conveyed so much.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TbvJbbgFhrQ |title=Val McDermid interviews JK Rowling (Robert Galbraith) at Harrogate International Festival 2014 |access-date=11 January 2020 |date=September 2014 |format=video |minutes=14-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hogwartsprofessor.com/christies-murder-at-the-vicarage-bellatrix-lestranges-debut-in-fiction/ |title=Christie\u2019s \u2018Murder at the Vicarage\u2019 Bellatrix Lestrange\u2019s Debut in Fiction? |date=21 August 2019 |access-date=11 January 2020 |work=Hogwarts Professor Thoughts and Ideas |author=John }}</ref>\n\n==Allusions in other novels==\nThe Vicar and his wife, Leonard and Griselda Clement, who made their first appearance in this novel, continue to show up in Miss Marple stories. Notably, they feature in ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (1942) along with Slack and Melchett, and ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957).\n\nThe character of Miss Marple had previously appeared in [[short stories]] published in magazines starting in December 1927. These earlier stories were collected in book form in ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' in 1932.\n\n==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==\n\n===The Murder at the Vicarage (1949 play)===\nThe story was adapted into a play by Moie Charles and [[Barbara Toy]] in 1949 and opened at the [[Playhouse Theatre]] on 16 December 1949. Miss Marple was played by [[Barbara Mullen]].\n\n{{Main|Murder at the Vicarage (play)}}\n\n===Television adaptations===\nThe [[BBC]] adapted the book into a film on 25 December 1986, with [[Joan Hickson]] as Miss Marple, [[Paul Eddington]] as the vicar, and [[Polly Adams]] as Anne Protheroe. The adaptation was generally very close to the original novel with four major exceptions: the trap which exposes the killer is changed to involve another murder attempt, the characters of Dennis, Dr. Stone, and Gladys Cram were deleted, Bill Archer is present in the kitchen while the murder takes place, and Anne commits suicide out of remorse instead of being tried.\n\nIt was presented again on the ITV series ''[[Agatha Christie's Marple]]'' by [[Granada Television]] in 2004 with [[Geraldine McEwan]] as Miss Marple, [[Tim McInnerny]] as the vicar, [[Derek Jacobi]] as Colonel Protheroe, and [[Janet McTeer]] as Anne. This version eliminates the characters of Dr. Stone and Gladys Cram, replacing them with the elderly French Professor Dufosse and his granddaughter H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\n\nOther changes include the elimination of Miss Weatherby, the changing of Mrs. Price-Ridley's first name from Martha to Marjorie, the renaming of Bill Archer to Frank Tarrent, and the addition of a plotline in which the Colonel stole 10,000 [[francs]] from the [[French Resistance]], which led to the death of an agent.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}}\n\nTwo major departures from the book are the portrayal of Miss Marple as Anne's close friend and the addition of a series of flashbacks to December 1915, when a younger Miss Marple was engaged in a forbidden love affair with a married soldier.\n\nIn both versions, the vicar's role is reduced and he does not participate in the investigation since his presence as the narrator was unnecessary in a filmed version.\n\n===Graphic novel adaptation===\n''The Murder at the Vicarage'' was released by [[HarperCollins]] as a [[graphic novel]] adaptation on 20 May 2008, adapted and illustrated by \"Norma\" (Norbert Morandi\u00e8re) ({{ISBN|0-00-727460-2}}).
