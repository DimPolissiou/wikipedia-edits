A time meter will appear on the top of the screen, and if the player lives through the end of the level, they will be awarded bonus points for badges that represent feats accomplished. Eri and Tarma were replaced with Nadia and Trevor.\n\n==Plot==\nOne year after the events of [[Metal Slug 3]] (timeline wise, also after [[Metal Slug 6]], which takes place after 3) the world is trembling under the new threat of a mysterious but deadly cyber virus that threatens to attack and destroy any nation's military computer system. With Tarma and Eri unable to help due to their own assignments in the matter, Marco Rossi and Fiolina Germi are called in to investigate the situation and are joined by two newcomers, Nadia Cassel and Trevor Spacey. In their investigation, the group discovers that a rich terrorist organization known as the Amadeus Syndicate is behind the nefarious plot and has allied with General Morden's Rebel Army. They head into battle against Amadeus' forces, hoping to destroy the cyber virus before it gets the chance to wipe out the entire world's military computer system.\n\nHalfway through the game's story mode, the player is confronted by who they presume to be General Morden, however in the final stage they find an underground facility where android doubles of Morden are being manufactured. Allen O' Neil (who has appeared numerous times throughout the series) fights the player in this stage for the very last time, and is also revealed to be a machine replica. Finally, the player confronts the leader of the syndicate, Dr. Amadeus himself, who attacks with a series of powerful robots, but he is defeated and is trapped in his own devices as the base self-destructs, presumably killing him. If the player safely escapes the base's bonus explosion stage, the credits will show the main cast eating a feast of food, but if the player gets caught in the explosion, the player character(s) will appear in the hospital, bandaged and bed-ridden, being brought get-well gifts of food from Eri Kasamoto and Tarma Roving. After the credits, a single computer monitor is seen transmitting data to an unknown location before shutting down.\n\n==New features==\n*Double Heavy Machine Guns [2H]: The stronger version of the Heavy Machine Gun [H] in the previous series. Allow players to carry two submachine guns which causes 1 damage per shot and fires more rapidly than the Heavy Machine Gun. However, the 2Hs are very rare in the game and have only 200 shots like the Heavy Machine Gun and can only fire in four directions.\n*Monkey Transformation: In the underground path of stage 1 and the final stage, there are scientists with rifles. These aren't loaded with bullets but a special chemical shot, that transforms characters into gibbons which are like the monkey Utan in Metal Slug 3. Although this transformation is new, the sprites used for it are not, they are recycled from Metal Slug 3. Players gain a much stronger jumping ability and the ability to hang on the bars over their heads, which saves them from most of the attacks from the enemy, although they are unable to shoot upward while on the bars (they can still shoot in horizontal directions and directly downwards). But they can only fire a small gun which is similar to the Heavy Machine Gun, walk very slowly, and takes longer to throw grenades. Players can be transformed back into human form by picking up an antidote dropped by scientists. This transformation is the only one in the series with an animation for returning to human form, in which the player falls asleep as a monkey then promptly wakes up as a human. Players who are hit by the chemical shot while in the monkey form will die.\n\n===New Slugs===\n*Bradley: First appeared in Metal Slug 2 as an enemy rocket shooting vehicle, it is equipped with powerful rocket shots and a vulcan cannon like the slugs, players can use it after killing the enemy soldier inside it. However, this vehicle has a very short jumping range and crouches much slower than the other vehicles, and will not become temporarily invincible after receiving an attack from the enemy.\n*Metal Claw: First appeared in Metal Slug as the \"Melty Honey\" under the control of the Rebel soldiers. It will appear with Bradley in stage 2 on a two-player game. It is equipped with a blade-covered shield that shreds enemies, and also enables it to take five shots before it is destroyed. Also in stage 5.\n*Crawler: A mechanical version of the sub-human mutants from Metal Slug 2/X which appears in stage 4. Much like the Camel Slug in the previous two games, it provides no protection to the player, but has a slightly better jumping ability and also does not harm the player if it touches a rolling bomb.\n*Forklift Truck: Appears in stage 5 along with the Metal Claw. Like the Drill Slug from Metal Slug 3, it can \"jack up\" if the player presses the jump button while on board the Forklift Truck. It will stab the enemy with the fork at the front if the player presses the bomb button. Its fork can shred enemies too. The Forklift Truck does not have a vulcan cannon; rather, the player uses whatever weapon they have. The player is always exposed to enemy attacks.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Empty section|date=December 2014}}\n''Metal Slug 4'' was mixed to positive received by players with users scores of 7.8 for PS2, 7.3 for Xbox, 8.1 for Neo Geo and 8.3 for the arcade versions.

Perceptual systems can also be studied [[computation]]ally, in terms of the information they process. [[Philosophy of perception|Perceptual issues in philosophy]] include the extent to which sensory qualities such as sound, smell or color exist in objective reality rather than in the mind of the perceiver.<ref name=\"mind_perception2\" />\n\nAlthough the senses were traditionally viewed as passive receptors, the study of [[illusion]]s and [[ambiguous image]]s has demonstrated that the brain's perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously attempt to make sense of their input.<ref name=\"mind_perception2\" /> There is still active debate about the extent to which perception is an active process of [[hypothesis]] testing, analogous to [[science]], or whether realistic sensory information is rich enough to make this process unnecessary.<ref name=\"mind_perception2\" />\n\nThe [[perceptual system]]s of the [[brain]] enable individuals to see the world around them as stable, even though the sensory information is typically incomplete and rapidly varying. Human and animal brains are structured in a [[Cognitive module|modular way]], with different areas processing different kinds of sensory information. Some of these modules take the form of [[Sensory Maps|sensory maps]], mapping some aspect of the world across part of the brain's surface.

(2011). Perception, Attribution, and Judgment of Others. Organizational Behaviour: Understanding and Managing Life at Work,  Vol. 7.</ref> This model is composed of three states:\n\n# When we encounter an unfamiliar target, we are very open to the informational [[sensory cue|cue]]s contained in the target and the situation surrounding it.\n# The first stage doesn't give us enough information on which to base perceptions of the target, so we will actively seek out cues to resolve this ambiguity. Gradually, we collect some familiar cues that enable us to make a rough categorization of the target. (see also [[Social identity theory|Social Identity Theory]])\n# The cues become less open and selective. We try to search for more cues that confirm the categorization of the target. We also actively ignore and even distort cues that violate our initial perceptions. Our perception becomes more selective and we finally paint a consistent picture of the target.\n\n=== Saks & John's Three Components to Perception ===\nAccording to [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan_Saks Alan Saks] and [https://www.concordia.ca/jmsb/faculty/gary-johns.html Gary Johns], there are three components to perception:<ref>Sincero, Sarah Mae. 2013. \"Perception.\" ''Explorable.'' Retrieved March 08, 2020 (https://explorable.com/perception).</ref>\n\n#'''The Perceiver''': a person whose awareness is focused on the stimulus, and thus begins to perceive it. There are many factors that may influence the perceptions of the perceiver, while the three major ones include (1) [[Motivation|motivational state]], (2) [[emotional state]], and (3) [[experience]]. All of these factors, especially the first two, greatly contribute to how the person perceives a situation. Oftentimes, the perceiver may employ what is called a \"perceptual defense,\" where the person will only \"see what they want to see\"\u2014i.e., they will only perceives what they want to perceive even though the stimulus acts on his or her senses.\n#'''The Target''': the ''object'' of perception; something or someone who is being perceived. The amount of information gathered by the sensory organs of the perceiver affects the interpretation and understanding about the target.\n#'''The Situation''': the ''environmental'' factors, timing, and degree of stimulation that affect the process of perception. These factors may render a single stimulus to be left as merely a stimulus, not a percept that is subject for brain interpretation.  \n\n==== Multistable Perception ====\nStimuli are not necessarily translated into a percept and rarely does a single stimulus translate into a percept. An ambiguous stimulus may sometimes be transduced into one or more percepts, experienced randomly, one at a time, in a process termed \"''[[multistable perception]]''.\" The same stimuli, or absence of them, may result in different percepts depending on subject's culture and previous experiences. \n\nAmbiguous figures demonstrate that a single stimulus can result in more than one percept. For example, the [[Rubin vase]] can be interpreted either as a vase or as two faces. The percept can bind sensations from multiple senses into a whole. A picture of a talking person on a television screen, for example, is bound to the sound of speech from speakers to form a percept of a talking person. \n\n== Types of Perception ==\n\n=== Vision ===\n{{main|Visual perception}}In many ways, vision is the primary human sense. Light is taken in through each eye and focused in a way which sorts it on the retina according to direction of origin. A dense surface of photosensitive cells, including rods, cones, and [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells]] captures information about the intensity, color, and position of incoming light. Some processing of texture and movement occurs within the neurons on the retina before the information is sent to the brain. In total, about 15 differing types of information are then forwarded to the brain proper via the optic nerve.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gollisch|first1=Tim|last2=Meister|first2=Markus|date=28 January 2010|title=Eye Smarter than Scientists Believed: Neural Computations in Circuits of the Retina|journal=Neuron|volume=65|issue=2|pages=150\u2013164|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.12.009|pmc=3717333|pmid=20152123}}</ref>[[File:Anatomy_of_the_Human_Ear_en.svg|right|thumb|Anatomy of the human ear. (The length of the auditory canal is exaggerated in this image).{{Anatomy of the human ear - color legend}}]]\n=== Sound ===\n{{main|Hearing (sense)}}Hearing (or ''audition'') is the ability to perceive [[sound]] by detecting [[vibration]]s (i.e., ''sonic'' detection). Frequencies capable of being heard by humans are called [[Audio frequency|''audio'' or ''audible'' ''frequencies'']], the range of which is typically considered to be between 20&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&nbsp;Hz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml|title=Frequency Range of Human Hearing|work=The Physics Factbook|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921163910/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml|archivedate=21 September 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Frequencies higher than audio are referred to as [[Ultrasound|''ultrasonic'']], while frequencies below audio are referred to as [[Infrasound|''infrasonic'']]. \n\nThe [[auditory system]] includes the [[Ear|outer ears]], which collect and filter sound waves; the [[Ear|middle ear]], which transforms the sound pressure ([[impedance matching]]); and the [[Ear|inner ear]], which produces neural signals in response to the sound. By the ascending [[auditory pathway]] these are led to the [[primary auditory cortex]] within the [[temporal lobe]] of the human brain, from where the auditory information then goes to the [[cerebral cortex]] for further processing.\n\nSound does not usually come from a single source: in real situations, sounds from multiple sources and directions are [[mwod:superimpose|superimposed]] as they arrive at the ears. Hearing involves the computationally complex task of separating out sources of interest, identifying them and often estimating their distance and direction.<ref name=\"eop_constancy\" />\n\n=== Touch ===\n{{main|Haptic perception}}The process of recognizing objects through touch is known as ''haptic perception''. It involves a combination of [[somatosensory]] perception of patterns on the skin surface (e.g., edges, curvature, and texture) and [[proprioception]] of hand position and conformation. People can rapidly and accurately identify three-dimensional objects by touch.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Klatzky|first1=R. L.|last2=Lederman|first2=S. J.|last3=Metzger|first3=V.

Research in this field seeks to understand how human listeners recognize the sound of speech (or ''[[phonetics]]'') and use such information to understand spoken language. \n\nListeners manage to perceive words across a wide range of conditions, as the sound of a word can vary widely according to words that surround it and the [[tempo]] of the speech, as well as the physical characteristics, [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], and mood of the speaker. [[Reverberation]], signifying the persistence of sound after the sound is produced, can also have a considerable impact on perception.

In 1999, psychologists [[Daniel Wegner|Wegner]] and Wheatley gave subjects instructions to move a mouse around a scene and point to an image about once every thirty seconds. However, a second person\u2014acting as a test subject but actually a confederate\u2014had their hand on the mouse at the same time, and controlled some of the movement.

Research attention is currently focused not only on external perception processes, but also to \"[[interoception]]\", considered as the process of receiving, accessing and appraising internal bodily signals. Maintaining desired physiological states is critical for an organism's well being and survival. [[Interoception]] is an iterative process, requiring the interplay between perception of body states and awareness of these states to generate proper self-regulation.

These principles are [[Principles of grouping|organized into six categories]]:\n\n# '''Proximity''': the principle of ''[[Proximity principle|proximity]]'' states that, [[Ceteris paribus|all else being equal]], perception tends to group stimuli that are close together as part of the same object, and [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] that are far apart as two separate objects. \n# '''Similarity''': the principle of ''[[Similarity (psychology)|similarity]]'' states that, all else being equal, perception lends itself to seeing stimuli that physically resemble each other as part of the same object and that are different as part of a separate object. This allows for people to distinguish between adjacent and overlapping objects based on their [[Texture (visual arts)#Visual texture|visual texture]] and [[Nominalism|resemblance]]. \n# '''Closure''': the principle of ''[[Closure (psychology)|closure]]'' refers to the mind's tendency to see complete figures or forms even if a picture is incomplete, partially hidden by other objects, or if part of the information needed to make a complete picture in our minds is missing. For example, if part of a shape's border is missing people still tend to see the shape as completely enclosed by the border and ignore the gaps. \n# '''Good Continuation:''' the principle of ''[[Principles of grouping#Good continuation|good continuation]]'' makes sense of stimuli that overlap: when there is an intersection between two or more objects, people tend to perceive each as a single uninterrupted object. \n# '''Common Fate''': the principle of ''[[Principles of grouping#Common fate|common fate]]'' groups stimuli together on the basis of their movement. When visual elements are seen moving in the same direction at the same rate, perception associates the movement as part of the same stimulus. This allows people to make out moving objects even when other details, such as color or outline, are obscured. \n# The principle of ''[[Principles of grouping#Good form|good form]]'' refers to the tendency to group together forms of similar shape, pattern, [[color]], etc.<ref>Gray, Peter O.

Instead, Gibson investigated what information is actually presented to the perceptual systems.

And it supposes that the visual system can explore and detect this information. The theory is information-based, not sensation-based.\"<ref>Gibson, James J.

It posits that, without perception, action would be unguided, and without action, perception would serve no purpose. Animate actions require both perception and motion, which can be described as \"two sides of the same coin, the coin is action.\" Gibson works from the assumption that singular entities, which he calls ''invariants,'' already exist in the real world and that all that the perception process does is home in upon them. \n\nThe [[Constructive perception|constructivist view]], held by such philosophers as [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]], regards the continual adjustment of perception and action to the external input as precisely what constitutes the \"entity,\" which is therefore far from being invariant.<ref>Consciousness in Action, S. L. Hurley, illustrated, Harvard University Press, 2002, 0674007964, pp. 430\u2013432.</ref> Glasersfeld considers an ''invariant'' as a target to be homed in upon, and a pragmatic necessity to allow an initial measure of understanding to be established prior to the updating that a statement aims to achieve. The invariant does not, and need not, represent an actuality. Glasersfeld describes it as extremely unlikely that what is desired or [[Fear processing in the brain|feared]] by an organism will never suffer change as time goes on. This [[social constructionist]] theory thus allows for a needful evolutionary adjustment.<ref>Glasersfeld, Ernst von (1995), ''Radical Constructivism: A Way of Knowing and Learning,'' London: RoutledgeFalmer; Poerksen, Bernhard (ed.) (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8-_EsHHxHYcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false The Certainty of Uncertainty: Dialogues Introducing Constructivism],'' Exeter: Imprint Academic; Wright. Edmond (2005). ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Macmillan]].</ref>\n\nA mathematical theory of perception-in-action has been devised and investigated in many forms of controlled movement, and has been described in many different species of organism using the [[General Tau Theory]]. According to this theory, [[Tau (mathematical constant)|tau information,]] or time-to-goal information is the fundamental ''percept'' in perception.\n\n=== Evolutionary Psychology (EP) ===\nMany philosophers, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], write that the purpose of perception is knowledge. However, [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] hold that the primary purpose of perception is to guide action.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\">Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney.

Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 4, pp. 81\u2013101.</ref> They give the example of [[depth perception]], which seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> \n\nEvolutionary psychologists argue that animals ranging from [[Fiddler crab|fiddler crabs]] to humans use eyesight for [[Collision avoidance in transportation|collision avoidance]], suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> [[Neuropsychology|Neuropsychologists]] showed that perception systems evolved along the specifics of animals' activities. This explains why bats and worms can perceive different frequency of auditory and visual systems than, for example, humans.\n\nBuilding and maintaining sense organs is [[metabolically]] expensive. More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources. Thus, such organs evolve only when they provide exceptional benefits to an organism's fitness.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> \n\nScientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> Sound waves provide useful information about the sources of and distances to objects, with larger animals making and hearing lower-frequency sounds and smaller animals making and hearing higher-frequency sounds.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that were significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> Sensory abilities of different organisms often co-evolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" />\n\nEvolutionary psychologists claim that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain suffer from the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces ([[Prosopagnosia|''prosopagnosia'']]).<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> EP suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" />\n\n=== Closed-loop perception ===\nThe theory of [[closed-loop transfer function|closed-loop perception]] proposes dynamic motor-sensory closed-loop process in which information flows through the environment and the brain in continuous loops.<ref name=\"Dewey1\">Dewey, J.

Specifically, these practices enable perception skills to switch from the external (exteroceptive field) towards a higher ability to focus on internal signals ([[proprioception|''proprioception'']]). Also, when asked to provide verticality judgments, highly self-transcendent [[yoga]] practitioners were significantly less influenced by a misleading visual context. Increasing self-transcendence may enable yoga practitioners to optimize verticality judgment tasks by relying more on internal (vestibular and proprioceptive) signals coming from their own body, rather than on exteroceptive, visual cues.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fiori|first1=Francesca|last2=David|first2=Nicole|last3=Aglioti|first3=Salvatore Maria|date=2014|title=Processing of proprioceptive and vestibular body signals and self-transcendence in Ashtanga yoga practitioners|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=8|pages=734|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00734|pmid=25278866|pmc=4166896}}</ref>\n\nPast actions and events that transpire right before an encounter or any form of stimulation have a strong degree of influence on how sensory stimuli are processed and perceived. On a basic level, the information our senses receive is often ambiguous and incomplete. However, they are grouped together in order for us to be able to understand the physical world around us. But it is these various forms of stimulation, combined with our previous knowledge and experience that allows us to create our overall perception. For example, when  engaging in conversation, we attempt to understand their message and words by not only paying attention to what we hear through our ears but also from the previous shapes we have seen our mouths make. Another example would be if we had a similar topic come up in another conversation, we would use our previous knowledge to guess the direction the conversation is headed in.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=Joel |date=31 October 2015 |pmc=4628108 |title=How previous experience shapes perception in different sensory modalities |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |volume=9 |pages=594 |pmid=26582982 |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2015.00594 }}</ref>\n\n=== Effect of motivation and expectation ===\n{{main|Set (psychology)}}A ''perceptual set'', also called ''perceptual expectancy'' or just ''set'' is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way.<ref name=\"Weiten2008\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&pg=PT193|title=Psychology: Themes and Variations|last=Weiten|first=Wayne|date=17 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-60197-5|page=193|accessdate=24 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163032/http://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&pg=PT193|archivedate=9 November 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is an example of how perception can be shaped by \"top-down\" processes such as drives and expectations.<ref name=\"CoonMitterer2008\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&pg=PA171|title=Introduction to Psychology: Gateways to Mind and Behavior|last1=Coon|first1=Dennis|last2=Mitterer|first2=John O.|date=29 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59911-1|pages=171\u2013172|accessdate=24 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162432/http://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&pg=PA171|archivedate=9 November 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses.<ref name=\"Sonderegger1998\" /> They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one's own name in a crowded room, or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food.<ref name=\"HardyHeyes1999\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&pg=PA24|title=Beginning Psychology|last1=Hardy|first1=Malcolm|last2=Heyes|first2=Steve|date=2 December 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-832821-6|pages=24\u201327|accessdate=24 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163023/http://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&pg=PA24|archivedate=9 November 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non-words such as \"sael\".

Clark says this research has various implications; not only can there be no completely \"unbiased, unfiltered\" perception, but this means that there is a great deal of feedback between perception and expectation (perceptual experiences often shape our beliefs, but those perceptions were based on existing beliefs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html|title=Predictive Coding|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205173145/http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html|archivedate=5 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Indeed, predictive coding provides an account where this type of feedback assists in stabilizing our inference-making process about the physical world, such as with perceptual constancy examples.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology}}{{columns-list|* [[Action-specific perception]]\n* [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome]] {{nb10}}\n* [[Apophenia]]\n* [[Change blindness]]\n* [[Generic views]]\n* [[Ideasthesia]]\n* [[Introspection]]\n* [[Model-dependent realism]]\n* [[Multisensory integration]]\n* [[Near sets]]\n* [[Neural correlates of consciousness]]\n* [[Pareidolia]] {{nb10}}\n* [[Perceptual paradox]]\n* [[Philosophy of perception]]\n* [[Proprioception]]\n* [[Qualia]]\n* [[Recept]]\n* [[Samj\u00f1\u0101]], the Buddhist concept of perception\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n* [[Simulation]]\n* [[Visual routine]]\n* [[Transsaccadic memory]]\n* [[Binding problem|Binding Problem]]|colwidth=22em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* Arnheim, R.

(2011). Perception, Attribution, and Judgment of Others. Organizational Behaviour: Understanding and Managing Life at Work,  Vol. 7.</ref> This model is composed of three states:\n\n# When we encounter an unfamiliar target, we are very open to the informational [[sensory cue|cue]]s contained in the target and the situation surrounding it.\n# The first stage doesn't give us enough information on which to base perceptions of the target, so we will actively seek out cues to resolve this ambiguity. Gradually, we collect some familiar cues that enable us to make a rough categorization of the target. (see also [[Social identity theory|Social Identity Theory]])\n# The cues become less open and selective. We try to search for more cues that confirm the categorization of the target. We also actively ignore and even distort cues that violate our initial perceptions. Our perception becomes more selective and we finally paint a consistent picture of the target.\n\n=== Saks & John's Three Components to Perception ===\nAccording to [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan_Saks Alan Saks] and [https://www.concordia.ca/jmsb/faculty/gary-johns.html Gary Johns], there are three components to perception:<ref>Sincero, Sarah Mae. 2013. \"Perception.\" ''Explorable.'' Retrieved March 08, 2020 (https://explorable.com/perception).</ref>\n\n#'''The Perceiver''': a person whose awareness is focused on the stimulus, and thus begins to perceive it. There are many factors that may influence the perceptions of the perceiver, while the three major ones include (1) [[Motivation|motivational state]], (2) [[emotional state]], and (3) [[experience]]. All of these factors, especially the first two, greatly contribute to how the person perceives a situation. Oftentimes, the perceiver may employ what is called a \"perceptual defense,\" where the person will only \"see what they want to see\"\u2014i.e., they will only perceives what they want to perceive even though the stimulus acts on his or her senses.\n#'''The Target''': the ''object'' of perception; something or someone who is being perceived. The amount of information gathered by the sensory organs of the perceiver affects the interpretation and understanding about the target.\n#'''The Situation''': the ''environmental'' factors, timing, and degree of stimulation that affect the process of perception. These factors may render a single stimulus to be left as merely a stimulus, not a percept that is subject for brain interpretation.  \n\n==== Multistable Perception ====\nStimuli are not necessarily translated into a percept and rarely does a single stimulus translate into a percept. An ambiguous stimulus may sometimes be transduced into one or more percepts, experienced randomly, one at a time, in a process termed \"''[[multistable perception]]''.\" The same stimuli, or absence of them, may result in different percepts depending on subject's culture and previous experiences. \n\nAmbiguous figures demonstrate that a single stimulus can result in more than one percept. For example, the [[Rubin vase]] can be interpreted either as a vase or as two faces. The percept can bind sensations from multiple senses into a whole. A picture of a talking person on a television screen, for example, is bound to the sound of speech from speakers to form a percept of a talking person. \n\n== Types of Perception ==\n\n=== Vision ===\n{{main|Visual perception}}In many ways, vision is the primary human sense. Light is taken in through each eye and focused in a way which sorts it on the retina according to direction of origin. A dense surface of photosensitive cells, including rods, cones, and [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells]] captures information about the intensity, color, and position of incoming light. Some processing of texture and movement occurs within the neurons on the retina before the information is sent to the brain. In total, about 15 differing types of information are then forwarded to the brain proper via the optic nerve.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gollisch|first1=Tim|last2=Meister|first2=Markus|date=28 January 2010|title=Eye Smarter than Scientists Believed: Neural Computations in Circuits of the Retina|journal=Neuron|volume=65|issue=2|pages=150\u2013164|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.12.009|pmc=3717333|pmid=20152123}}</ref>[[File:Anatomy_of_the_Human_Ear_en.svg|right|thumb|Anatomy of the human ear.

Frequencies capable of being heard by humans are called [[Audio frequency|''audio'' or ''audible'' ''frequencies'']], the range of which is typically considered to be between 20&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&nbsp;Hz.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml|title=Frequency Range of Human Hearing|work=The Physics Factbook|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921163910/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml|archivedate=21 September 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Frequencies higher than audio are referred to as [[Ultrasound|''ultrasonic'']], while frequencies below audio are referred to as [[Infrasound|''infrasonic'']]. \n\nThe [[auditory system]] includes the [[Ear|outer ears]], which collect and filter sound waves; the [[Ear|middle ear]], which transforms the sound pressure ([[impedance matching]]); and the [[Ear|inner ear]], which produces neural signals in response to the sound. By the ascending [[auditory pathway]] these are led to the [[primary auditory cortex]] within the [[temporal lobe]] of the human brain, from where the auditory information then goes to the [[cerebral cortex]] for further processing.\n\nSound does not usually come from a single source: in real situations, sounds from multiple sources and directions are [[mwod:superimpose|superimposed]] as they arrive at the ears. Hearing involves the computationally complex task of separating out sources of interest, identifying them and often estimating their distance and direction.<ref name=\"eop_constancy\" />\n\n=== Touch ===\n{{main|Haptic perception}}The process of recognizing objects through touch is known as ''haptic perception''. It involves a combination of [[somatosensory]] perception of patterns on the skin surface (e.g., edges, curvature, and texture) and [[proprioception]] of hand position and conformation. People can rapidly and accurately identify three-dimensional objects by touch.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Klatzky|first1=R. L.|last2=Lederman|first2=S. J.|last3=Metzger|first3=V.

Research in this field seeks to understand how human listeners recognize the sound of speech (or ''[[phonetics]]'') and use such information to understand spoken language. \n\nListeners manage to perceive words across a wide range of conditions, as the sound of a word can vary widely according to words that surround it and the [[tempo]] of the speech, as well as the physical characteristics, [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], and mood of the speaker. [[Reverberation]], signifying the persistence of sound after the sound is produced, can also have a considerable impact on perception. Experiments have shown that people automatically compensate for this effect when hearing speech.<ref name=\"eop_constancy\" /><ref name=\"Watkins2010\">{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACkNL-G7gUUC&pg=PA440|title=The Neurophysiological Bases of Auditory Perception|last1=Watkins|first1=Anthony J.|last2=Raimond|first2=Andrew|last3=Makin|first3=Simon J.|date=23 March 2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-5685-9|editor-last=Lopez-Poveda|editor-first=Enrique A.|page=440|chapter=Room reflection and constancy in speech-like sounds: Within-band effects|accessdate=26 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163241/http://books.google.com/books?id=ACkNL-G7gUUC&pg=PA440|archivedate=9 November 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all|bibcode=2010nbap.book.....L}}</ref>\n\nThe process of perceiving speech begins at the level of the sound within the auditory signal and the process of [[Hearing (sense)|audition]].

Some conditions, such as [[schizophrenia]], can cause a loss of this sense, which may lead a person into delusions, such as feeling like a machine or like an outside source is controlling them. An opposite extreme can also occur, where people experience everything in their environment as though they had decided that it would happen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Metzinger|first=Thomas|title=The Ego Tunnel|publisher=Basic Books|year=2009|isbn=978-0-465-04567-9|pages=117\u2013118}}</ref>\n\nEven in non-[[Pathology|pathological]] cases, there is a measurable difference between the making of a decision and the feeling of agency. Through methods such as [[Neuroscience of free will#Libet experiment|the Libet experiment]], a gap of half a second or more can be detected from the time when there are detectable neurological signs of a decision having been made to the time when the subject actually becomes conscious of the decision.\n\nThere are also experiments in which an illusion of agency is induced in psychologically normal subjects. In 1999, psychologists [[Daniel Wegner|Wegner]] and Wheatley gave subjects instructions to move a mouse around a scene and point to an image about once every thirty seconds. However, a second person\u2014acting as a test subject but actually a confederate\u2014had their hand on the mouse at the same time, and controlled some of the movement.

Research attention is currently focused not only on external perception processes, but also to \"[[interoception]]\", considered as the process of receiving, accessing and appraising internal bodily signals. Maintaining desired physiological states is critical for an organism's well being and survival. [[Interoception]] is an iterative process, requiring the interplay between perception of body states and awareness of these states to generate proper self-regulation.

Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to [[perceive]] patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are [[Principles of grouping|organized into six categories]]:\n\n# '''Proximity''': the principle of ''[[Proximity principle|proximity]]'' states that, [[Ceteris paribus|all else being equal]], perception tends to group stimuli that are close together as part of the same object, and [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] that are far apart as two separate objects. \n# '''Similarity''': the principle of ''[[Similarity (psychology)|similarity]]'' states that, all else being equal, perception lends itself to seeing stimuli that physically resemble each other as part of the same object and that are different as part of a separate object. This allows for people to distinguish between adjacent and overlapping objects based on their [[Texture (visual arts)#Visual texture|visual texture]] and [[Nominalism|resemblance]]. \n# '''Closure''': the principle of ''[[Closure (psychology)|closure]]'' refers to the mind's tendency to see complete figures or forms even if a picture is incomplete, partially hidden by other objects, or if part of the information needed to make a complete picture in our minds is missing. For example, if part of a shape's border is missing people still tend to see the shape as completely enclosed by the border and ignore the gaps. \n# '''Good Continuation:''' the principle of ''[[Principles of grouping#Good continuation|good continuation]]'' makes sense of stimuli that overlap: when there is an intersection between two or more objects, people tend to perceive each as a single uninterrupted object. \n# '''Common Fate''': the principle of ''[[Principles of grouping#Common fate|common fate]]'' groups stimuli together on the basis of their movement. When visual elements are seen moving in the same direction at the same rate, perception associates the movement as part of the same stimulus. This allows people to make out moving objects even when other details, such as color or outline, are obscured. \n# The principle of ''[[Principles of grouping#Good form|good form]]'' refers to the tendency to group together forms of similar shape, pattern, [[color]], etc.<ref>Gray, Peter O.

It posits that, without perception, action would be unguided, and without action, perception would serve no purpose. Animate actions require both perception and motion, which can be described as \"two sides of the same coin, the coin is action.\" Gibson works from the assumption that singular entities, which he calls ''invariants,'' already exist in the real world and that all that the perception process does is home in upon them. \n\nThe [[Constructive perception|constructivist view]], held by such philosophers as [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]], regards the continual adjustment of perception and action to the external input as precisely what constitutes the \"entity,\" which is therefore far from being invariant.<ref>Consciousness in Action, S. L. Hurley, illustrated, Harvard University Press, 2002, 0674007964, pp. 430\u2013432.</ref> Glasersfeld considers an ''invariant'' as a target to be homed in upon, and a pragmatic necessity to allow an initial measure of understanding to be established prior to the updating that a statement aims to achieve. The invariant does not, and need not, represent an actuality. Glasersfeld describes it as extremely unlikely that what is desired or [[Fear processing in the brain|feared]] by an organism will never suffer change as time goes on. This [[social constructionist]] theory thus allows for a needful evolutionary adjustment.<ref>Glasersfeld, Ernst von (1995), ''Radical Constructivism: A Way of Knowing and Learning,'' London: RoutledgeFalmer; Poerksen, Bernhard (ed.)

According to this theory, [[Tau (mathematical constant)|tau information,]] or time-to-goal information is the fundamental ''percept'' in perception.\n\n=== Evolutionary Psychology (EP) ===\nMany philosophers, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], write that the purpose of perception is knowledge. However, [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] hold that the primary purpose of perception is to guide action.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\">Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney.

Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 4, pp. 81\u2013101.</ref> They give the example of [[depth perception]], which seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> \n\nEvolutionary psychologists argue that animals ranging from [[Fiddler crab|fiddler crabs]] to humans use eyesight for [[Collision avoidance in transportation|collision avoidance]], suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> [[Neuropsychology|Neuropsychologists]] showed that perception systems evolved along the specifics of animals' activities. This explains why bats and worms can perceive different frequency of auditory and visual systems than, for example, humans.\n\nBuilding and maintaining sense organs is [[metabolically]] expensive. More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources. Thus, such organs evolve only when they provide exceptional benefits to an organism's fitness.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> \n\nScientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> Sound waves provide useful information about the sources of and distances to objects, with larger animals making and hearing lower-frequency sounds and smaller animals making and hearing higher-frequency sounds.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that were significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> Sensory abilities of different organisms often co-evolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" />\n\nEvolutionary psychologists claim that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain suffer from the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces ([[Prosopagnosia|''prosopagnosia'']]).<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" /> EP suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.<ref name=\"Gaulin 4\" />\n\n=== Closed-loop perception ===\nThe theory of [[closed-loop transfer function|closed-loop perception]] proposes dynamic motor-sensory closed-loop process in which information flows through the environment and the brain in continuous loops.<ref name=\"Dewey1\">Dewey, J.

Specifically, these practices enable perception skills to switch from the external (exteroceptive field) towards a higher ability to focus on internal signals ([[proprioception|''proprioception'']]). Also, when asked to provide verticality judgments, highly self-transcendent [[yoga]] practitioners were significantly less influenced by a misleading visual context. Increasing self-transcendence may enable yoga practitioners to optimize verticality judgment tasks by relying more on internal (vestibular and proprioceptive) signals coming from their own body, rather than on exteroceptive, visual cues.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fiori|first1=Francesca|last2=David|first2=Nicole|last3=Aglioti|first3=Salvatore Maria|date=2014|title=Processing of proprioceptive and vestibular body signals and self-transcendence in Ashtanga yoga practitioners|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=8|pages=734|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00734|pmid=25278866|pmc=4166896}}</ref>\n\nPast actions and events that transpire right before an encounter or any form of stimulation have a strong degree of influence on how sensory stimuli are processed and perceived. On a basic level, the information our senses receive is often ambiguous and incomplete. However, they are grouped together in order for us to be able to understand the physical world around us. But it is these various forms of stimulation, combined with our previous knowledge and experience that allows us to create our overall perception. For example, when  engaging in conversation, we attempt to understand their message and words by not only paying attention to what we hear through our ears but also from the previous shapes we have seen our mouths make. Another example would be if we had a similar topic come up in another conversation, we would use our previous knowledge to guess the direction the conversation is headed in.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=Joel |date=31 October 2015 |pmc=4628108 |title=How previous experience shapes perception in different sensory modalities |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |volume=9 |pages=594 |pmid=26582982 |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2015.00594 }}</ref>\n\n=== Effect of motivation and expectation ===\n{{main|Set (psychology)}}A ''perceptual set'', also called ''perceptual expectancy'' or just ''set'' is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way.<ref name=\"Weiten2008\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&pg=PT193|title=Psychology: Themes and Variations|last=Weiten|first=Wayne|date=17 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-60197-5|page=193|accessdate=24 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163032/http://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&pg=PT193|archivedate=9 November 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is an example of how perception can be shaped by \"top-down\" processes such as drives and expectations.<ref name=\"CoonMitterer2008\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&pg=PA171|title=Introduction to Psychology: Gateways to Mind and Behavior|last1=Coon|first1=Dennis|last2=Mitterer|first2=John O.|date=29 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59911-1|pages=171\u2013172|accessdate=24 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109162432/http://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&pg=PA171|archivedate=9 November 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses.<ref name=\"Sonderegger1998\" /> They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one's own name in a crowded room, or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food.<ref name=\"HardyHeyes1999\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&pg=PA24|title=Beginning Psychology|last1=Hardy|first1=Malcolm|last2=Heyes|first2=Steve|date=2 December 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-832821-6|pages=24\u201327|accessdate=24 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109163023/http://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&pg=PA24|archivedate=9 November 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non-words such as \"sael\".

Clark says this research has various implications; not only can there be no completely \"unbiased, unfiltered\" perception, but this means that there is a great deal of feedback between perception and expectation (perceptual experiences often shape our beliefs, but those perceptions were based on existing beliefs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html|title=Predictive Coding|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205173145/http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_6.html|archivedate=5 December 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Indeed, predictive coding provides an account where this type of feedback assists in stabilizing our inference-making process about the physical world, such as with perceptual constancy examples.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology}}{{columns-list|* [[Action-specific perception]]\n* [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome]] {{nb10}}\n* [[Apophenia]]\n* [[Change blindness]]\n* [[Generic views]]\n* [[Ideasthesia]]\n* [[Introspection]]\n* [[Model-dependent realism]]\n* [[Multisensory integration]]\n* [[Near sets]]\n* [[Neural correlates of consciousness]]\n* [[Pareidolia]] {{nb10}}\n* [[Perceptual paradox]]\n* [[Philosophy of perception]]\n* [[Proprioception]]\n* [[Qualia]]\n* [[Recept]]\n* [[Samj\u00f1\u0101]], the Buddhist concept of perception\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n* [[Simulation]]\n* [[Visual routine]]\n* [[Transsaccadic memory]]\n* [[Binding problem|Binding Problem]]|colwidth=22em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* Arnheim, R.

Ford\", ''[[Newport News Daily Press]]'', 15 November 2009.</ref>\n\nThe ship's crest was developed jointly by the ship sponsor and the first commanding officer Captain John F. Meier. The background is a map of the world representing the global presence of USS Gerald R. Ford and the future Ford Class aircraft carriers. The map directly links the Ford's global mission of strength and freedom to the Chief of Naval Operations\u2019 guiding principle of operating forward.  The thirty eight surrounding stars honor the 38th President of the United States. Twenty six of the stars are gold, representing the aircraft carrier USS Monterey (CVL 26), aboard which Lieutenant Commander Gerald R. Ford served in combat during World War II. The core color scheme is maize and blue representing President Ford's undergraduate university, the University of Michigan. The inner rings are Yale University's blue and white colors, in tribute to the law school from which he received his law degree. The ship's motto \"Integrity At The Helm\" highlights President Ford's extraordinary legacy of integrity and honesty and his legacy's connection with the Navy's core values.  President Ford's signature symbolizes his personal connection to CVN 78 and, in particular, the immense pride he felt upon learning that CVN 78 would bear his name.  A nautical compass with a fleur-de-lis pointing true north is included on the Ship's Crest to symbolize the Boy Scouts of America in honor of President Ford's distinction as the only President who achieved the rank of Eagle Scout.  The compass itself recalls the resolute moral compass President Ford utilized in leading America through its greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://geraldrfordfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/RFS-Final-Commissioning-Special-Edition.pdf |title=Gerald R.

In a speech to the assembled shipworkers and DoD officials, Bales said: \"Dad met the staggering challenges of restoring trust in the presidency and healing the nation's wounds after Watergate in the only way he knew how\u2014with complete honesty and integrity. And that is the legacy we remember this morning.\"<ref>Frost, Peter, \"Shipyard Lays Keel Of Carrier In Solemn Tribute To Gerald R. Ford\", ''[[Newport News Daily Press]]'', 15 November 2009.</ref>\n\nThe ship's crest was developed jointly by the ship sponsor and the first commanding officer Captain John F. Meier. The background is a map of the world representing the global presence of USS Gerald R. Ford and the future Ford Class aircraft carriers. The map directly links the Ford's global mission of strength and freedom to the Chief of Naval Operations\u2019 guiding principle of operating forward.  The thirty eight surrounding stars honor the 38th President of the United States. Twenty six of the stars are gold, representing the aircraft carrier USS Monterey (CVL 26), aboard which Lieutenant Commander Gerald R. Ford served in combat during World War II. The core color scheme is maize and blue representing President Ford's undergraduate university, the University of Michigan. The inner rings are Yale University's blue and white colors, in tribute to the law school from which he received his law degree. The ship's motto \"Integrity At The Helm\" highlights President Ford's extraordinary legacy of integrity and honesty and his legacy's connection with the Navy's core values.  President Ford's signature symbolizes his personal connection to CVN 78 and, in particular, the immense pride he felt upon learning that CVN 78 would bear his name.  A nautical compass with a fleur-de-lis pointing true north is included on the Ship's Crest to symbolize the Boy Scouts of America in honor of President Ford's distinction as the only President who achieved the rank of Eagle Scout.  The compass itself recalls the resolute moral compass President Ford utilized in leading America through its greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://geraldrfordfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/RFS-Final-Commissioning-Special-Edition.pdf |title=Gerald R.

The Navy estimates it will save $4 billion in operating costs over a 50-year lifespan.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Ford-class aircraft carrier: 25 percent more flights per day|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/1109/USS-Gerald-R.-Ford-New-aircraft-carrier-with-25-percent-more-flights-per-day|work=CS monitor|date=9 November 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109201309/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/1109/USS-Gerald-R.-Ford-New-aircraft-carrier-with-25-percent-more-flights-per-day|archivedate=9 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to an Associated Press story:\n{{Cquote | \u2018She is truly a technological marvel,' [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Adm.
