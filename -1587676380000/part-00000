Wirt developed the '''Gary Plan''' for the more efficient use of school facilities, a reform of the [[Progressive Movement]] that was widely adopted in other cities.\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Wirt was born on a farm near [[Markle, Indiana]], in 1874. After attending school in [[Markle, Indiana|Markle]] and [[Bluffton, Indiana]], Mr. Wirt entered [[DePauw University]] and graduated with an M.A. in Political Science. He began teaching in [[Redkey, Indiana]] and assumed the post of superintendent of schools in Bluffton in 1899.\n\n==Philosophy of education==\n\nWhile in Bluffton, Wirt developed a philosophy of education partially based upon a set of values derived from his rural background. He viewed the self-sufficient family farm as containing all of the characteristics necessary for a student's development, particularly vocational training, physical activity, and character growth. Work and productivity characterized rural life, and Wirt believed that the rapid urbanization occurring in the early twentieth century threatened the rural values necessary for total development of children. Wirt maintained that the public schools should provide an oasis to instill the values of family, work, and productivity among urban students and produce an efficient, orderly society of solid, productive citizens. In short, Wirt believed that, \"Public schools, endowed with the mission of 'the ennobling of daily and common work by making it beautiful'\" could solve \"the great economic and social problems of our time'\u201c\n\n==As superintendent of education==\nIn 1907, Wirt became superintendent of schools in Gary and began implementing his educational values in the local schools. He initiated teacher hiring standards, designed school buildings, lengthened the school day, and organized the schools according to his ideals. The core of the schools' organization in Gary centered upon the [[platoon]] or work-study-play system and Americanizing the 63.4 percent of children with parents who were immigrants.<ref name=weiner35>Weiner, 2010, p. 35.</ref> Above the primary grades, students were divided into two platoons\u2014one platoon used the academic classrooms (which were deemphasized), while the second platoon was divided between the shops, nature studies, auditorium, gymnasium, and outdoor facilities split between girls and boys. \"Girls learned cooking, sewing, and bookkeeping while the boys learning metalwork, cabinetry, woodworking, painting, printing, shoemaking, and plumbing.\"<ref name=weiner35 /> In the Gary plan, all of the school equipment remained in use during the entire school day; Rather than opening up new schools for the overwhelming population of students, it was hoped that the \"Gary Plan would save the city money by utilizing all rooms in existing schools by rotating children through classrooms, auditoriums, playgrounds, and gymnasiums.\"<ref name=weiner35 />\n\nThe platoon system gained acceptance in Gary and received national attention during the early decades of the twentieth century. In 1914, the [[New York City]] hired Wirt as a part-time consultant to introduce the work-study-play system in the public schools. In the following three years, however, the Gary system encountered resistance from students, parents, and labor leaders concerned that the plan simply trained children to work in factories and the fact that Gary's Plan was in predominantly Jewish areas.<ref name=weiner35 /> \"In January 1916, the Board of Education released a report finding students attending Gary Plan schools performed worse than those in 'non-Garyuzed schools' .\"<ref>Weiner, 2010, p. 42.</ref> By 1917, the Gary system in New York became a political issue that after the election of an antiplatoon plan candidate [John F. Hylan] for mayor in 1918, the New York schools abandoned the work-study-play project.\n\nDespite the failure in New York, Wirt's system continued to achieve popularity during the 1920s. In Gary, the schools grew rapidly to serve the growing population and enrollment. Buildings, staff, and funding increased with the higher demand for education in the city. Outside of Gary, over 200 cities in forty-one states experimented with the platoon system, and in 1925, the National Association for the Study of the [[Platoon]] or Work-Study-Play School Organization formed to publicize the advantages of the platoon system. Wirt not only received national recognition but also gained worldwide fame from England to Japan.\n\n==Released time==\nWirt was also responsible in the implementation of the [[Released time]] program. In the first years of Wirt's implementation, over 600 students participated in off-campus religious education.\n\n==Business ventures==\nIn addition to his duties as school superintendent, Wirt became involved in several business ventures including real estate development in [[Dune Acres]], president of Gary's National Bank of America, a partnership in a city planning firm, and owner in a Nash automobile dealership. Unfortunately, all of these projects yielded little financial gain and eventually failed with the onset of the Great Depression.\n\n==Marriage==\nIn 1927, Wirt married Mildred Harter, the general supervisor of speech in the Gary schools. From 1919 to 1926, she taught at Froebel School and became the director of speech and drama in the Gary school system in 1929. During her career, Mildred Harter Wirt developed a philosophy of the role of auditorium training in the school curriculum and wrote several articles on auditorium theory. In addition, she taught summer courses in auditorium subjects at [[Northwestern University]] and the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1948, Mrs. Wirt earned a Ph.D. in education from Jefferson College in Jefferson, [[Texas]], with a thesis entitled, \"Educational Philosophy of the Gary Public Schools.\"\n\n==The Depression==\nWhile the 1920s saw the growth and expansion of Wirt's influence and organization plan in Gary, the 1930s brought controversy and dissent among Wirt's proponents and supporters of the Gary schools. The Depression resulted in smaller budgets, program cuts, reductions in teachers' salaries, a shortened school year, and cancellation of night school and summer courses. Although these programs were restored by 1937, teacher discontent over salaries continued to appear in the late 1930s. In addition, arguments arose over the proper role of vocational training in the schools, and Gary's black community became increasingly impatient with [[Racial segregation|segregation]] policy in the schools.\n\n==Attack against the New Deal programs==\nIn addition to these concerns, William Wirt launched an attack upon [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] programs, charging that the New Deal threatened [[United States|American]] individualism by attempting government planning of the economy. He wrote pamphlets, articles, and addresses on the economy, particularly regarding the manipulation of the dollar to solve the economic crisis. Finally, Wirt accused the New Deal of being infiltrated by communists designing the collapse of the American system.  His ideas appeared in his pamphlet ''America Must Lose by a \u201cPlanned Economy,\u201d the Stepping-Stone to a Regimented State'' (1934).<ref name=dab>{{Cite DAB|title=Wirt, William Albert|volume=Supplement Two|author=Carter V. Good|year=1958}}</ref>\n\nThe pamphlet made him the target of a libel suit,<ref name=dab /> and Wirt's charges received national attention when the school [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]] appeared before the Bulwinkle investigative committee in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1934. After his testimony against the [[Roosevelt Brain Trust]], he was denounced as a reactionary by Democrats and those on the left, and defended by those on the right. Although the committee rejected Wirt's charges, the superintendent continued to write and speak on the dangers of the New Deal economic programs.\n\n==Death==\nWirt suffered a heart attack and died on March 12, 1938.\n\nWithin two years, much of the work-study-play plan fell from favor among school officials, and William Wirt's platoon system of educating the \"whole child\" disappeared from the Gary schools' organization. Historian Ronald D. Cohen summarized William Wirt's contributions to the Gary schools by stating, \" at their worst, the Gary schools were places where bored, frightened students were endlessly herded from room to playground to auditorium; at their best they were free, exciting, creative environments, assisting and enriching the lives of rich and poor, black and white, native and immigrant children. For many, they surely promoted opportunity.\"\n\n==See also==\n*[[Wirt High School]], established in Gary, Indiana in 1939, named after Wirt\n*[[Alice Barrows]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Cohen, Ronald D. and Mohl, Raymond A.

He was the [[Anglican Diocese of Johannesburg|Bishop of Johannesburg]] from 1985 to 1986 and then the [[Archbishop of Cape Town]] from 1986 to 1996, in both cases being the first black African to hold the position. Theologically, he sought to fuse ideas from [[black theology]] with [[African theology]]; politically, he identifies as a [[socialist]]. He was known to really like zoology.\n\nTutu was born of mixed [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Tswana people|Motswana]] heritage to a poor family in [[Klerksdorp]], [[Union of South Africa]]. Entering adulthood, he trained as a teacher and married [[Nomalizo Leah Tutu]], with whom he had several children. In 1960, he was ordained as an Anglican priest and in 1962 moved to the United Kingdom to study theology at [[King's College London]]. In 1966 he returned to southern Africa, teaching at the [[Federal Theological Seminary of Southern Africa|Federal Theological Seminary]] and then the [[University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland]]. In 1972, he became the Theological Education Fund's director for Africa, a position based in [[London]] but necessitating regular tours of the African continent. Back in southern Africa in 1975, he served first as [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg|St Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Johannesburg]] and then as [[Bishop of Lesotho]], taking an active role in opposition to South Africa's [[apartheid]] system of [[racial segregation]] and [[White South African|white-minority]] rule. From 1978 to 1985 he was general-secretary of the [[South African Council of Churches]], emerging as one of South Africa's most prominent anti-apartheid activists. Although warning the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government that anger at apartheid would lead to racial violence, as an activist he stressed [[non-violent protest]] and foreign economic pressure to bring about [[universal suffrage]].\n\nIn 1985, Tutu became Bishop of Johannesburg and in 1986 the Archbishop of Cape Town, the most senior position in southern Africa's Anglican hierarchy. In this position he emphasised a consensus-building model of leadership and oversaw the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|introduction of women priests]]. Also in 1986, he became president of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]], resulting in further tours of the continent. After President [[F. W. de Klerk]] released the anti-apartheid activist [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison in 1990 and the pair led negotiations to end apartheid and introduce multi-racial democracy, Tutu assisted as a mediator between rival black factions. After the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general election]] resulted in a [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|coalition government]] headed by Mandela, the latter selected Tutu to chair the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to investigate past human rights abuses committed by both pro and anti-apartheid groups. Since apartheid's fall, Tutu has campaigned for [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay rights]] and spoken out on a wide range of subjects, among them the [[Israel-Palestine conflict]], his opposition to the [[Iraq War]], and his criticism of South African Presidents [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Jacob Zuma]]. In 2010, he retired from public life.\n\nTutu polarised opinion as he rose to notability in the 1970s.

The two did not get on well, and argued.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=127|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=1\u20135}} Botha accused Tutu of supporting the ANC's armed campaign; Tutu said that while he did not support their use of violence, he supported the ANC's objective of a non-racial, democratic South Africa.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=5\u20136}} The death sentences were ultimately commuted.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=6}}\n\nIn May 1988, the government launched a covert campaign against Tutu, organised in part by [[State Security Council#Stratkom|Stratkom]] wing of the [[State Security Council]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=293, 294}} The security police printed leaflets and stickers with anti-Tutu slogans while unemployed blacks were paid to protest at the airport when he arrived there.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=293, 294}} Traffic police arrested Leah and locked her in a cell when she was late to renew her motor vehicle license.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=294}} Although the security police organised assassination attempts on various anti-apartheid Christian leaders, they later claimed to have never done so for Tutu, regarding him as too high-profile.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=295}}\n\nTutu remained actively involved in acts of [[civil disobedience]] against the government; he was encouraged by the fact that many whites also took part in these protests.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=307}} In August 1989 he helped to organise an \"Ecumenical Defiance Service\" at St George's Cathedral,{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=301\u2013302}} and shortly after joined protests at segregated beaches outside Cape Town.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=131|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=303}} To mark the sixth anniversary of the UDF's foundation he held a \"service of witness\" at the cathedral,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=304}} and in September organised a church memorial for those protesters who had been killed in clashes with the security forces.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=131|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=308}} He organised a protest march through Cape Town for later that month, which the new President [[F.

The ANC asked Tutu if Mandela and his wife Winnie could stay at Bishopscourt on the first night of his freedom, to which Tutu agreed.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=135\u2013136|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=313|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=409}} They met for the first time in 35 years at Cape Town City Hall, where Mandela gave a speech to assembled crowds from the balcony.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=314}} Tutu invited Mandela to attend an Anglican synod of bishops in February 1990, at which the latter described Tutu as the \"people's archbishop\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=315\u2013316}} At that synod, Tutu and the bishops decide to call for an end to foreign sanctions once the transition to universal suffrage was \"irreversible\", urged anti-apartheid groups to end their use of armed struggle, and ban Anglican clergy from belonging to political parties.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=316}} Many clergy protested about the latter point, particularly as it has been imposed without consultation.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=320}} Tutu publicly defended the decision, stating that if priests openly affiliated with political parties then it would prove divisive, particularly amid the growing violence between the supporters of rival parties throughout South Africa.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=320\u2013321}}\n\nIn March, violence broke out between supporters of the ANC and of [[Inkatha Freedom Party|Inkatha]] in [[kwaZulu]]; Tutu cancelled a visit to the US to join the SACC delegation in talks within Mandela, de Klerk, and Inkatha leader [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] in [[Ulundi]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=317}} Church leaders urged Mandela and Buthelezi to hold a joint rally to quell the violent rivalry between their respective parties.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=319}} Although Tutu's relationship with Buthelezi had always been strained\u2014particularly due to Tutu's opposition to Buthelezi's collaboration in the apartheid government's [[Bantustan]] system\u2014the clergyman visited Buthelezi on a number of occasions to encourage his involvement in the democratic process.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=318\u2013319}} As the ANC-Inkatha violence spread from kwaZulu into the Transvaal, Tutu toured affected townships in Witwatersrand, visiting those made homeless and calling for peace.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=137|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=321\u2013322}} He visited the victims of the massacre at [[Sebokeng]],{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=137\u2013138|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=323}} and later those of the [[Boipatong massacre]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=139|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=329}}\n\nLike many other activists, Tutu believed that there was a \"[[Third Force (South Africa)|third force]]\" stoking the tensions between the ANC and Inkatha; it later emerged that sectors of the intelligence agencies were supplying Inkatha with weapons to weaken the ANC's negotiating position.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=138|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=325}} Unlike some ANC figures, Tutu never accused de Klerk of personal complicity in these operations.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=325\u2013326}} In November 1990, Tutu organised a \"summit\" at Bishopscourt attended by both church leaders and leaders of political groups like the ANC, PAC, and AZAPO, in which he encouraged them to call on their supporters to avoid violence and allow free political campaigning.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=138|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=328}} After the [[South African Communist Party]] leader [[Chris Hani]] was assassinated by a white man, Tutu served as preacher at Hani's funeral outside Soweto; despite his objections to Hani's Marxist beliefs, Tutu had admired him as an activist.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=140|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=333\u2013334}} Amid these events, Tutu had experienced physical exhaustion and ill-health,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=327}} and he undertook a four-month sabbatical at [[Emory University]]'s Candler School of Theology in Atlanta, Georgia.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=138|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=329}}\n\nTutu had been exhilarated by the prospect that South Africa was transforming towards universal suffrage via a negotiated transition rather than a racial civil war.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=315}} He allowed his face to be used on posters encouraging South Africans to vote.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=142}} When the [[South African general election, 1994|April 1994 multi-racial general election]] took place, Tutu was visibly exuberant, telling reporters that \"we are on cloud nine\".{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=142|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=338}} He voted in Cape Town's [[Gugulethu]] township.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=142|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=338}} The ANC won the election and Mandela was declared president, overseeing the formation of a government of national unity.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=143|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=339}} Tutu attended Mandela's inauguration ceremony and had been responsible for planning its religious component; Tutu had insisted that it be a multi-religious ceremony, with Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and Hindu leaders taking part in prayers and readings.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\n====International affairs====\n\nAlongside his domestic work, he also turned his attention to events elsewhere in Africa, and in 1987 gave the keynote speech at the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]] (AACC) in [[Lom\u00e9]], Togo. There, he called on churches to champion the oppressed throughout the continent, stating that \"it pains us to have to admit that there is less freedom and personal liberty in most of Africa now then there was during the much-maligned colonial days.\"{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=347\u2013348}} At the conference, he was elected president of the AACC, while [[Jos\u00e9 Belo]] was elected its general-secretary. Calling for an \"African renaissance\" across the continent, the pair formed a partnership that would last a decade.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=130|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=375}} In 1989 they visited Zaire to encourage the country's churches to distance themselves from Seko's autocratic government.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=130|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=375}} In 1994, he and Belo visited war-torn Liberia in a mission co-organised by the AACC and the [[Carter Center]]. There, they met [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], but Tutu did not trust his promise of a ceasefire.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=376\u2013377}} In 1995, Mandela sent Tutu to Nigeria to meet with Nigerian military leader [[Sani Abacha]] to request the release of imprisoned politicians [[Moshood Abiola]] and [[Olusegun Obasanjo]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=377}} In July 1995, he visited Rwanda a year after the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]], where he preached to 10,000 people in [[Kigali]]. Drawing on his experiences in South Africa, he called for justice to be tempered with mercy towards the Hutu who had orchestrated the genocide.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=377\u2013378}} Tutu also travelled to other parts of world, for instance spending March 1989 in Panama and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=130}}\n\nTutu also spoke out on the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]]. While in New York in 1989, he had praised God for the creation of the state of Israel and asserted its right to \"territorial integrity and fundamental security against attacks from those who deny her right to exist\".{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=129|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=383}} He visited [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] leader [[Yasser Arafat]] in Cairo, urging him to accept Israel's existence.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=385}} At the same time he expressed anger that Israel had supplied military hardware to South Africa during the apartheid era, expressing bemusement as to how the Jewish state could co-operate with a government that had contained many Nazi sympathisers.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=382\u2013383, 384}} Referring to the [[Israeli-occupied territories]] in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, he stated that there were \"deeply, deeply distressing\" parallels with the situation in apartheid South Africa.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=384}} He called for the formation of a distinct Palestinian state,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=382}} and emphasised that his criticisms were of the Israeli government rather than Jews as a broader group.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=388}} At the invite of Palestinian bishop [[Samir Kafity]], he undertook a [[Christmas]] pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where he gave a sermon at [[Shepherd's Field]] near [[Bethlehem]], in which he called for a [[two-state solution]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=384, 386}} On that trip, he also visited the [[Yad Vashem]] Holocaust memorial, where he laid a wreath and spoke to journalists on the importance of forgiveness.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=386\u2013387}} His calls to forgive those who perpetrated the Holocaust, coupled with his support for a Palestinian state, brought criticism from many Jewish groups across the world.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=387}} This was exacerbated by the fact that he sought to evade suspicions of [[anti-Semitism]] through comments such as \"my dentist is a Dr. Cohen\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=385}}\n\nTutu also spoke out regarding [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. At the Lambeth conference of 1988, he backed a resolution on the issue which condemned the use of violence by all sides; Tutu believed that, given Irish republicans had the right to vote, they had not exhausted peaceful means of bringing about change and thus should not resort to armed struggle.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} Three years later, he gave a televised service from [[Dublin]]'s [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] where he called for negotiations to take place between all factions, including the Irish republican [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], groups which Thatcher's UK government had refused to engage with.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} He visited [[Belfast]] in 1998 and again in 2001.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=382}}\n\n==Later life==\nIn October 1994, Tutu announced his intention to retire as archbishop in 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=144}} Although retired archbishops normally return to the position of bishop, the other bishops bestowed on him a new title: \"archbishop emeritus\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} A farewell ceremony was held at St George's Cathedral in June 1996, attended by senior politicians like Mandela and de Klerk.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} There, Mandela awarded Tutu the [[Order for Meritorious Service]], South Africa's highest honour.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} Tutu was succeeded as archbishop by Ndungane.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}}\n\nIn January 1997, Tutu was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and travelled abroad for treatment.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=153|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=370}} He publicly revealed his diagnosis, hoping to encourage other men to go for prostate exams.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=153}} He faced recurrences of the disease in 1999 and 2006.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=370}} Back in South Africa, he divided his time between homes in Soweto's Orlando West and Cape Town's [[Milnerton]] area.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In 2000, he opened an office in Cape Town.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In June 2000, the Cape Town-based Desmond Tutu Peace Centre was launched, which in 2003 launched an Emerging Leadership Program.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}}\n\nConscious that his presence in South Africa might overshadow Ndungane, Tutu agreed to a two-year [[visiting professor]]ship at Emory University.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} This took place between 1998 and 2000, and during the period he wrote a book about the TRC, ''No Future Without Forgiveness''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=162}} In early 2002 he taught at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} From January to May 2003 he taught at the [[University of North Carolina]].{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} In January 2004, he was visiting professor of postconflict societies at KCL, his ''alma mater''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} While in the United States, he signed up with a speakers' agency and travelled widely on speaking engagements; this gave him financial independence in a way that his clerical pension would not.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In his speeches, he focused on South Africa's transition from apartheid to universal suffrage, presenting it as a model for other troubled nations to adopt.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=161}} In the US, he thanked anti-apartheid activists for campaigning for sanctions, also calling for US companies to now invest in South Africa.{{sfn|Gish|2004|pp=161\u2013162}}\n\n===Truth and Reconciliation Commission: 1996\u20131998===\n\n[[File:Desmond Tutu 1997.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[Embassy of South Africa, Washington, D.C.]], in 1997]]\nTutu popularised the term \"[[Rainbow Nation]]\" as a metaphor for [[post-apartheid South Africa]] after 1994 under ANC rule.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=520}} He had first used the metaphor in 1989 when he described a multi-racial protest crowd as the \"rainbow people of God\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=391}} Tutu advocated what liberation theologians call \"critical solidarity\", offering support for pro-democracy forces while reserving the right to criticise his allies.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=315}} He criticised Mandela on several points, such as his tendency to wear brightly coloured [[Madiba shirt]]s, which he regarded as inappropriate; Mandela offered the tongue-in-cheek response that it was ironic coming from a man who wore dresses.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=345}} More serious was Tutu's criticism of Mandela's retention of South Africa's apartheid-era armaments industry and the significant pay packet that newly elected Members of Parliament adopted.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=143\u2013144|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=517}} Mandela hit back, calling Tutu a \"populist\" and stating that he should have raised these issues privately rather than publicly.{{sfnm|1a1=Allen|1y=2006|1p=345|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=517}}\n\nA key question facing the post-apartheid government was how they would respond to the various human rights abuses that had been committed over the previous decades by both the state and by anti-apartheid activists. The National Party had wanted a comprehensive amnesty package whereas the ANC wanted trials of former state figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=343\u2013344}} [[Alex Boraine]] helped Mandela's government to draw up legislation for the establishment of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), which was passed by parliament in July 1995.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=344\u2013345}} Nuttall suggested that Tutu become one of the TRC's seventeen commissioners, while in September a synod of bishops formally nominated him.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=147|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345}} Tutu proposed that the TRC adopt a threefold approach: the first being confession, with those responsible for human rights abuses fully disclosing their activities, the second being forgiveness in the form of a legal amnesty from prosecution, and the third being restitution, with the perpetrators making amends to their victims.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=344}}\n\nMandela named Tutu as the chair of the TRC, with Boraine as his deputy.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=147, 148|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=345\u2013346|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=529}} The commission was a significant undertaking, employing over 300 staff, dividing into three committees, and holding as many as four hearings simultaneously.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=346}} In the TRC, Tutu advocated \"restorative justice\", something which he considered characteristic of traditional African jurisprudence \"in the spirit of ''ubuntu''\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=347}} As head of the commission, Tutu had to deal with its various inter-personal problems, with much suspicion between those on its board who had been anti-apartheid activists and those who had supported the apartheid system.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=349}} He acknowledged that \"we really were like a bunch of prima donnas, frequently hypersensitive, often taking umbrage easily at real or imagined slights\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} Tutu opened meetings with prayers and often referred to Christian teachings when discussing the TRC's work, frustrating some who saw him as incorporating too many religious elements into an expressly secular body.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}}\n\nThe first hearing took place in April 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} The hearings were publicly televised and had a considerable impact on South African society.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=350}} He had very little control over the committee responsible for granting amnesty, instead chairing the committee which heard accounts of human rights abuses perpetrated by both anti-apartheid and apartheid figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=348}} While listening to the testimony of victims, Tutu was sometimes overwhelmed by emotion and cried during the hearings.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=352}} He singled out those victims who expressed forgiveness towards those who had harmed them and used these individuals as his leitmotif.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=351}} The ANC's image was tarnished by the revelations that some of its activists had engaged in torture, attacks on civilians, and other human rights abuses. It sought to suppress part of the final TRC report, infuriating Tutu.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=157|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=366\u2013367|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3pp=531\u2013532}} He warned of the ANC's \"abuse of power\", stating that \"yesterday's oppressed can quite easily become today's oppressors...

She has nurtured the deepest things in us blacks.\"{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=115}}\n\nHe became, according to Du Boulay, \"one of the most eloquent and persuasive communicators\" of black theology.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}} He expressed his views on theology largely through sermons and addresses rather than in extended academic treatises.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}}\nTutu expressed the view that Western theology sought answers to questions that Africans were not asking.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=135\u2013136}} For Tutu, two major questions were being posed by African Christianity: how to replace imported Christian expressions of faith with something authentically African, and how to liberate people from bondage.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=136}} He believed that there were many comparisons to be made between contemporary African understandings of God and those featured in the Old Testament.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=137}} He nevertheless criticised African theology for failing to sufficiently address contemporary societal problems, and suggested that to correct this it should learn from the black theology tradition.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=116}}\n\nWhen chairing the TRC, Tutu advocated an explicitly Christian model of reconciliation, as part of which he believed that South Africans had to face up to the damages that they had caused and accept the consequences of their actions.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} As part of this, he believed that the perpetrators and beneficiaries of apartheid must admit to their actions but that the system's victims should respond generously, stating that it was a \"gospel imperative\" to forgive.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} At the same time, he argued that those responsible had to display true repentance in the form of restitution.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\n[[File:Desmond tutu 20070607 2.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]], 2007]]\n\nGish noted that by the time of apartheid's fall, Tutu had attained \"worldwide respect\" for his \"uncompromising stand for justice and reconciliation and his unmatched integrity\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=148}} According to Allen, Tutu \"made a powerful and unique contribution to publicizing the antiapartheid struggle abroad\", particularly in the United States.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=233}} In the latter country, he was able to rise to prominence as a South African anti-apartheid activist because\u2014unlike Mandela and other members of the ANC\u2014he had no links to the South African Communist Party and thus was more acceptable to Americans amid the Cold War anti-communist sentiment of the period.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=253}} In the U.S., he was often compared to Martin Luther King, with the African-American civil rights activist [[Jesse Jackson]] referring to him as \"the Martin Luther King of South Africa\"; this was a comparison that Tutu was embarrassed by.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=198}}\nAfter the end of apartheid, Tutu became \"perhaps the world's most prominent religious leader advocating gay and lesbian rights\", according to Allen.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=372}} Ultimately, Allen thought that perhaps Tutu's \"greatest legacy\" was the fact that he gave \"to the world as it entered the twenty-first century an African model for expressing the nature of human community\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=396}}\n\nDuring Tutu's rise to notability during the 1970s and 1980s, responses to him were \"sharply polarized\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} Noting that he was \"simultaneously loved and hated, honoured and vilified\",{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=170}} Du Boulay attributed his divisive reception to the fact that \"strong people evoke strong emotions\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}} Tutu gained much adulation from black journalists, inspired imprisoned anti-apartheid activists, and led to many black parents naming their children after him.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} For many black South Africans, he was a respected religious leader and a symbol of black achievement.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=247}} By 1984 he was\u2014according to Gish\u2014\"the personification of the South African freedom struggle\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=103}} In 1988, Du Boulay described him as \"a spokesman for his people, a voice for the voiceless\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}}\n\nThe response he received from South Africa's white minority was more mixed. Most of those who criticised him were conservative whites who did not want a shift away from apartheid and white-minority rule.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=138|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=78}} Many of these whites were angered that he was calling for economic sanctions against South Africa and that he was warning that racial violence was impending.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=98}} Said whites often accused him of being a tool of the communists.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=236}} This hostility was exacerbated by the government's campaign to discredit Tutu and distort his image,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=97}} which included repeatedly misquoting him to present his statements out of context.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=263}} According to Du Boulay, the SABC and much of the white press went to \"extraordinary attempts to discredit him\", something that \"made it hard to know the man himself\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}} Allen noted that in 1984, Tutu was \"the black leader white South Africans most loved to hate\" and that this antipathy extended beyond supporters of the far-right government to liberals too.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=202}} The fact that he was \"an object of hate\" for many was something that deeply pained him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Hated by many white South Africans for being too radical, he was also scorned by many black militants for being too moderate.\n| source=\u2014 On Tutu in the mid-1980s, by Steven D.

1931) is a South African [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cleric and [[theologian]] known for his work as an [[anti-apartheid movement|anti-apartheid]] and [[human rights]] activist. He was the [[Anglican Diocese of Johannesburg|Bishop of Johannesburg]] from 1985 to 1986 and then the [[Archbishop of Cape Town]] from 1986 to 1996, in both cases being the first black African to hold the position. Theologically, he sought to fuse ideas from [[black theology]] with [[African theology]]; politically, he identifies as a [[socialist]].\n\nTutu was born of mixed [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Tswana people|Motswana]] heritage to a poor family in [[Klerksdorp]], [[Union of South Africa]]. Entering adulthood, he trained as a teacher and married [[Nomalizo Leah Tutu]], with whom he had several children. In 1960, he was ordained as an Anglican priest and in 1962 moved to the United Kingdom to study theology at [[King's College London]]. In 1966 he returned to southern Africa, teaching at the [[Federal Theological Seminary of Southern Africa|Federal Theological Seminary]] and then the [[University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland]]. In 1972, he became the Theological Education Fund's director for Africa, a position based in [[London]] but necessitating regular tours of the African continent. Back in southern Africa in 1975, he served first as [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg|St Mary's Cathedral]] in [[Johannesburg]] and then as [[Bishop of Lesotho]], taking an active role in opposition to South Africa's [[apartheid]] system of [[racial segregation]] and [[White South African|white-minority]] rule. From 1978 to 1985 he was general-secretary of the [[South African Council of Churches]], emerging as one of South Africa's most prominent anti-apartheid activists. Although warning the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government that anger at apartheid would lead to racial violence, as an activist he stressed [[non-violent protest]] and foreign economic pressure to bring about [[universal suffrage]].\n\nIn 1985, Tutu became Bishop of Johannesburg and in 1986 the Archbishop of Cape Town, the most senior position in southern Africa's Anglican hierarchy. In this position he emphasised a consensus-building model of leadership and oversaw the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|introduction of women priests]]. Also in 1986, he became president of the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]], resulting in further tours of the continent. After President [[F. W. de Klerk]] released the anti-apartheid activist [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison in 1990 and the pair led negotiations to end apartheid and introduce multi-racial democracy, Tutu assisted as a mediator between rival black factions. After the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general election]] resulted in a [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|coalition government]] headed by Mandela, the latter selected Tutu to chair the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] to investigate past human rights abuses committed by both pro and anti-apartheid groups. Since apartheid's fall, Tutu has campaigned for [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay rights]] and spoken out on a wide range of subjects, among them the [[Israel-Palestine conflict]], his opposition to the [[Iraq War]], and his criticism of South African Presidents [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Jacob Zuma]]. In 2010, he retired from public life.\n\nTutu polarised opinion as he rose to notability in the 1970s. White conservatives who supported apartheid despised him, while many white [[liberalism|liberals]] regarded him as too radical; many black radicals accused him of being too moderate and focused on cultivating white goodwill, while [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninists]] criticised his [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] stance. He was widely popular among South Africa's black majority, and was internationally praised for his anti-apartheid activism, receiving a range of awards, including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. He has also compiled several books of his speeches and sermons.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: 1931\u20131950===\n\nDesmond Mpilo Tutu was born on 7 October 1931 in [[Klerksdorp]], a city in [[North West (South African province)|northwest South Africa]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=2|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=9\u201310}} His mother, Allen Dorothea Mavoertsek Mathlare, was born to a [[Tswana people|Motswana]] family in [[Boksburg]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=10}} His father, Zachariah Zelilo Tutu, was from the [[Fengu people|amaFengu]] branch of [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and had grown up in [[Gcuwa]], [[Eastern Cape]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=10\u201311}} At home, the couple both spoke the [[Xhosa language]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=11}} Zachariah trained as a primary school teacher at [[Lovedale (South Africa)|Lovedale]] college before taking a post in Boksburg, where he married his wife.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=14}} In the late 1920s, he took a job in Klerksdorp; in the [[Afrikaaner]]-founded city, he and his wife resided in the black residential area. Established in 1907, it was then known as the \"native location\" although was later renamed Makoetend.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=14\u201315}} The native location housed a diverse community; although most residents were [[Tswana people|Tswana]], it also housed Xhosa, [[Sotho people|Sotho]], and a few Indian traders.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=16}} Zachariah worked as the principal of a [[Methodism|Methodist]] primary school and the family lived in the schoolmaster's house, a small mud-brick building in the yard of the Methodist mission.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=16}}\n\n[[File:ChurchofChristtheKing.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Church of Christ the King|The Church of Christ the King in Sophiatown, where Tutu was a server under priest Trevor Huddlestone]]\n\nThe Tutus were poor;{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=28|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=3}} describing his family, Tutu later related that \"although we weren't affluent, we were not destitute either\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} Tutu had an older sister, Sylvia Funeka, who called him \"Mpilo\" (\"life\"), a name given to him by his paternal grandmother.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=22, 29|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=3|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=19}} The rest of the family called him \"Boy\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=19}} He was his parent's second son; their firstborn boy, Sipho, had died in infancy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=19}} Another daughter, Gloria Lindiwe, would be born after him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=22}} Tutu was sickly from birth;{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=2|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=19}} [[polio]] resulted in the atrophy of his right hand,{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=32|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=19}} and on one occasion he was hospitalised with serious burns.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=20}} Tutu had a close relationship with his father, although was angered at the latter's heavy drinking, during which he would sometimes beat his wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=22|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=3|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=22}} The family were initially Methodists and Tutu was [[baptism|baptised]] into the [[Methodist Church of Southern Africa|Methodist Church]] in June 1932.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=30|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=33}} They subsequently changed denominations, first to the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] and then to the [[Anglican Church]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=30\u201331|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=33}}\n\nIn 1936, the family moved to [[Tshing]], where Zachariah was employed as the principal of a Methodist school; they lived in a hut in the school yard.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=20}} There, Tutu started his primary education and played football with the other children,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} also becoming the server at St Francis Anglican Church.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=33}} He developed a love of reading, particularly enjoying comic books and European [[fairy tales]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=30|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=21}} Here, he also learned [[Afrikaans]], the main language of the area.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=23|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=4|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=21}} It was in Tshing that his parents had a third son, Tamsanqa, who also died in infancy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=21}} Around 1941, Tutu's mother moved to [[Witwatersrand]] to work as a cook at Ezenzeleni, an institute for the blind in western Johannesburg. Tutu joined her in the city, first living with an aunt in [[Roodepoort|Roodepoort West]] before they secured their own house in the township.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=5|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=24}} In Johannesburg, he attended a Methodist primary school before transferring to the [[Swedish Boarding School]] (SBS) in the [[St. Martin's School (Rosettenville)|St Agnes Mission]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=24}} Several months later, he moved with his father to [[Ermelo]], eastern Transvaal.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=25}} After six months, the duo returned to live with the rest of the family in Roodepoort West, where Tutu resuming his studies at SBS.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=25}} He had pursued his interest in [[Christianity]] and at the age of 12 underwent [[confirmation]] at St Mary's Church, Roodepoort.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=34}}\n\nTutu failed the arithmetic component of his primary school exam, but despite this, his father secured him entry to the Johannesburg Bantu High School in 1945, where he excelled academically.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=25, 34\u201335}} There, he joined a school [[rugby union|rugby]] team, developing a lifelong love of the sport.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=36}} Outside of school, he earned money selling oranges and as a [[caddie]] for white [[golf]]ers.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=27|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=7|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=37}} To avoid the expense of a daily train commute to school, he briefly lived with family nearer to Johannesburg, before moving back in with his parents when they relocated to [[Munsieville]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=36, 37\u201338}} He then returned to Johannesburg by moving into a hostel that was part of the Anglican complex surrounding the Church of Christ the King in [[Sophiatown]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=29|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=8|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=42}} He became a server at the church and came under the influence of its priest, [[Trevor Huddleston]];{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=10|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=43\u201345}} later biographer [[Shirley du Boulay]] suggested that Huddleston was \"the greatest single influence\" in Tutu's life.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=31}} In 1947, Tutu contracted [[tuberculosis]] and was hospitalised in [[Rietfontein]] for 18 months, during which he spent much of his time reading and was regularly visited by Huddleston.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=29\u201330|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=9|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=45\u201346}} In the hospital, he underwent a [[circumcision]] to mark his transition to manhood.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=47}} He returned to school in 1949 and took his national exams in late 1950, gaining a second-class pass.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n===College and teaching career: 1951\u20131955===\n\nWanting to become a doctor, Desmond Tutu secured admission to study medicine at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]; however, his parents could not afford the tuition fees.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=47\u201348}} Instead, he turned toward teaching, gaining a government scholarship to start a course at Pretoria Bantu Normal College, a teacher training institution, in 1951.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=12|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=48}} There, he served as treasurer of the Student Representative Council, helped to organise the Literacy and Dramatic Society, and chaired the Cultural and Debating Society for two years.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=48}} It was during one local debating event that he first met the lawyer\u2014and future president of South Africa\u2014[[Nelson Mandela]]; the latter did not remember the meeting and they would not encounter each other again until 1990.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=17|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=48\u201349}} At the college, Tutu attained his Transvaal Bantu Teachers Diploma, having gained advice about taking exams from the activist [[Robert Sobukwe]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=37|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=18|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3p=50}} He had also taken five correspondence courses provided by the [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA), graduating in the same class as future Zimbabwean leader [[Robert Mugabe]].{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=37|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=18|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=49\u201350}}\n\nIn 1954, he began teaching English at Madibane High School; the following year, he transferred to the [[Krugersdorp High School]], where he taught English and history.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=37|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=17, 18|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=50\u201351}} He began courting Nomalizo Leah Shenxane, a friend of his sister Gloria who was studying to become a primary school teacher.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=18|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=51}} They were legally married at Krugersdorp Native Commissioner's Court in June 1955, before undergoing a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] wedding ceremony at the Church of Mary Queen of Apostles; although he was an Anglican, Tutu had agreed to the ceremony due to Leah's Roman Catholic faith.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=38|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=51\u201352}} The newly married couple initially lived in a room at Tutu's parental home before renting their own home six months later.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=52}} Their first child, Trevor, was born in April 1956;{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=22|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=53}} their first daughter, Thandeka, appeared 16 months later.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=53}} The couple worshipped at St Paul's Church, where Tutu volunteered as a [[Sunday school]] teacher, assistant choirmaster, church councillor, lay preacher, and sub-deacon,{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=53}} while outside of the church he also volunteered as a football administrator for a local team.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=52}}\n\n===Joining the clergy: 1956\u20131966===\n\n[[File:St Albans, Golders Green-2.jpg|thumb|right|Tutu first ministered to a white congregation at the Church of St Alban the Martyr in Golders Green, living with his family in the curate's flat]]\n\nIn 1953, the white-minority [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government had introduced the [[Bantu Education Act, 1953|Bantu Education Act]] as a means of furthering their [[apartheid]] system of racial segregation and white domination; both Tutu and his wife disliked these changes and decided to leave the teaching profession.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1pp=41\u201345|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2pp=20\u201321|3a1=Allen|3y=2006|3pp=60\u201361}} With Huddleston's support, Tutu left the teaching profession to become an Anglican priest.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=23|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=61}} In January 1956, his request to join the [[Ordinands Guild]] was turned down due to the debts he had accrued;

At the Lambeth conference of 1988, he backed a resolution on the issue which condemned the use of violence by all sides; Tutu believed that, given Irish republicans had the right to vote, they had not exhausted peaceful means of bringing about change and thus should not resort to armed struggle.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} Three years later, he gave a televised service from [[Dublin]]'s [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] where he called for negotiations to take place between all factions, including the Irish republican [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], groups which Thatcher's UK government had refused to engage with.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=381}} He visited [[Belfast]] in 1998 and again in 2001.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=382}}\n\n==Later life==\nIn October 1994, Tutu announced his intention to retire as archbishop in 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=144}} Although retired archbishops normally return to the position of bishop, the other bishops bestowed on him a new title: \"archbishop emeritus\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} A farewell ceremony was held at St George's Cathedral in June 1996, attended by senior politicians like Mandela and de Klerk.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} There, Mandela awarded Tutu the [[Order for Meritorious Service]], South Africa's highest honour.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=145}} Tutu was succeeded as archbishop by Ndungane.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}}\n\nIn January 1997, Tutu was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] and travelled abroad for treatment.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=153|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=370}} He publicly revealed his diagnosis, hoping to encourage other men to go for prostate exams.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=153}} He faced recurrences of the disease in 1999 and 2006.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=370}} Back in South Africa, he divided his time between homes in Soweto's Orlando West and Cape Town's [[Milnerton]] area.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In 2000, he opened an office in Cape Town.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In June 2000, the Cape Town-based Desmond Tutu Peace Centre was launched, which in 2003 launched an Emerging Leadership Program.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}}\n\nConscious that his presence in South Africa might overshadow Ndungane, Tutu agreed to a two-year [[visiting professor]]ship at Emory University.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} This took place between 1998 and 2000, and during the period he wrote a book about the TRC, ''No Future Without Forgiveness''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=162}} In early 2002 he taught at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} From January to May 2003 he taught at the [[University of North Carolina]].{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} In January 2004, he was visiting professor of postconflict societies at KCL, his ''alma mater''.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=163}} While in the United States, he signed up with a speakers' agency and travelled widely on speaking engagements; this gave him financial independence in a way that his clerical pension would not.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=371}} In his speeches, he focused on South Africa's transition from apartheid to universal suffrage, presenting it as a model for other troubled nations to adopt.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=161}} In the US, he thanked anti-apartheid activists for campaigning for sanctions, also calling for US companies to now invest in South Africa.{{sfn|Gish|2004|pp=161\u2013162}}\n\n===Truth and Reconciliation Commission: 1996\u20131998===\n\n[[File:Desmond Tutu 1997.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[Embassy of South Africa, Washington, D.C.]], in 1997]]\nTutu popularised the term \"[[Rainbow Nation]]\" as a metaphor for [[post-apartheid South Africa]] after 1994 under ANC rule.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=520}} He had first used the metaphor in 1989 when he described a multi-racial protest crowd as the \"rainbow people of God\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=391}} Tutu advocated what liberation theologians call \"critical solidarity\", offering support for pro-democracy forces while reserving the right to criticise his allies.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=315}} He criticised Mandela on several points, such as his tendency to wear brightly coloured [[Madiba shirt]]s, which he regarded as inappropriate; Mandela offered the tongue-in-cheek response that it was ironic coming from a man who wore dresses.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=345}} More serious was Tutu's criticism of Mandela's retention of South Africa's apartheid-era armaments industry and the significant pay packet that newly elected Members of Parliament adopted.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=143\u2013144|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=517}} Mandela hit back, calling Tutu a \"populist\" and stating that he should have raised these issues privately rather than publicly.{{sfnm|1a1=Allen|1y=2006|1p=345|2a1=Sampson|2y=2011|2p=517}}\n\nA key question facing the post-apartheid government was how they would respond to the various human rights abuses that had been committed over the previous decades by both the state and by anti-apartheid activists. The National Party had wanted a comprehensive amnesty package whereas the ANC wanted trials of former state figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=343\u2013344}} [[Alex Boraine]] helped Mandela's government to draw up legislation for the establishment of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC), which was passed by parliament in July 1995.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=344\u2013345}} Nuttall suggested that Tutu become one of the TRC's seventeen commissioners, while in September a synod of bishops formally nominated him.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=147|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=345}} Tutu proposed that the TRC adopt a threefold approach: the first being confession, with those responsible for human rights abuses fully disclosing their activities, the second being forgiveness in the form of a legal amnesty from prosecution, and the third being restitution, with the perpetrators making amends to their victims.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=344}}\n\nMandela named Tutu as the chair of the TRC, with Boraine as his deputy.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1pp=147, 148|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=345\u2013346|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3p=529}} The commission was a significant undertaking, employing over 300 staff, dividing into three committees, and holding as many as four hearings simultaneously.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=346}} In the TRC, Tutu advocated \"restorative justice\", something which he considered characteristic of traditional African jurisprudence \"in the spirit of ''ubuntu''\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=347}} As head of the commission, Tutu had to deal with its various inter-personal problems, with much suspicion between those on its board who had been anti-apartheid activists and those who had supported the apartheid system.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=349}} He acknowledged that \"we really were like a bunch of prima donnas, frequently hypersensitive, often taking umbrage easily at real or imagined slights\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} Tutu opened meetings with prayers and often referred to Christian teachings when discussing the TRC's work, frustrating some who saw him as incorporating too many religious elements into an expressly secular body.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}}\n\nThe first hearing took place in April 1996.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=150}} The hearings were publicly televised and had a considerable impact on South African society.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=350}} He had very little control over the committee responsible for granting amnesty, instead chairing the committee which heard accounts of human rights abuses perpetrated by both anti-apartheid and apartheid figures.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=348}} While listening to the testimony of victims, Tutu was sometimes overwhelmed by emotion and cried during the hearings.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=352}} He singled out those victims who expressed forgiveness towards those who had harmed them and used these individuals as his leitmotif.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=351}} The ANC's image was tarnished by the revelations that some of its activists had engaged in torture, attacks on civilians, and other human rights abuses. It sought to suppress part of the final TRC report, infuriating Tutu.{{sfnm|1a1=Gish|1y=2004|1p=157|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2pp=366\u2013367|3a1=Sampson|3y=2011|3pp=531\u2013532}} He warned of the ANC's \"abuse of power\", stating that \"yesterday's oppressed can quite easily become today's oppressors...

He noted that whereas the latter was a quicker and more efficient way of exterminating whole populations, the National Party's policy of forcibly relocating black South Africans to areas where they lacked access to food and sanitation had much the same result.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=212}} In his words, \"Apartheid is as evil and as vicious as Nazism and Communism\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=84}}\n\nTutu never became anti-white, in part due to his many positive experiences with white people.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=129}} In his speeches, he stressed that it was apartheid\u2014rather than white people\u2014that was the enemy.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=68}} He promoted racial reconciliation between South Africa's communities, believing that most blacks fundamentally wanted to live in harmony with whites,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=80}} although he stressed that reconciliation would only be possible among equals, after blacks had been given full civil rights.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=100}} He tried to cultivate goodwill from the country's white community, making a point of showing white individuals gratitude when they made concessions to black demands.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=80}} He also spoke to many white audiences, urging them to support his cause, referring to it as the \"winning side\",{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=161|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=81}} and reminding them that when apartheid had been overthrown, black South Africans would remember who their friends had been.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=186}} When he held public prayers, he always included mention of those who upheld apartheid, such as politicians and police, alongside the system's victims, emphasising his view that all humans were the children of God.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=74}} He stated that \"the people who are perpetrators of injury in our land are not sporting horns or tails.

She has nurtured the deepest things in us blacks.\"{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=115}}\n\nHe became, according to Du Boulay, \"one of the most eloquent and persuasive communicators\" of black theology.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}} He expressed his views on theology largely through sermons and addresses rather than in extended academic treatises.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=87}}\nTutu expressed the view that Western theology sought answers to questions that Africans were not asking.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=135\u2013136}} For Tutu, two major questions were being posed by African Christianity: how to replace imported Christian expressions of faith with something authentically African, and how to liberate people from bondage.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=136}} He believed that there were many comparisons to be made between contemporary African understandings of God and those featured in the Old Testament.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=137}} He nevertheless criticised African theology for failing to sufficiently address contemporary societal problems, and suggested that to correct this it should learn from the black theology tradition.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=116}}\n\nWhen chairing the TRC, Tutu advocated an explicitly Christian model of reconciliation, as part of which he believed that South Africans had to face up to the damages that they had caused and accept the consequences of their actions.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} As part of this, he believed that the perpetrators and beneficiaries of apartheid must admit to their actions but that the system's victims should respond generously, stating that it was a \"gospel imperative\" to forgive.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}} At the same time, he argued that those responsible had to display true repentance in the form of restitution.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=342}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\n[[File:Desmond tutu 20070607 2.jpg|thumb|Tutu at the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]], 2007]]\n\nGish noted that by the time of apartheid's fall, Tutu had attained \"worldwide respect\" for his \"uncompromising stand for justice and reconciliation and his unmatched integrity\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=148}} According to Allen, Tutu \"made a powerful and unique contribution to publicizing the antiapartheid struggle abroad\", particularly in the United States.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=233}} In the latter country, he was able to rise to prominence as a South African anti-apartheid activist because\u2014unlike Mandela and other members of the ANC\u2014he had no links to the South African Communist Party and thus was more acceptable to Americans amid the Cold War anti-communist sentiment of the period.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=253}} In the U.S., he was often compared to Martin Luther King, with the African-American civil rights activist [[Jesse Jackson]] referring to him as \"the Martin Luther King of South Africa\"; this was a comparison that Tutu was embarrassed by.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=198}}\nAfter the end of apartheid, Tutu became \"perhaps the world's most prominent religious leader advocating gay and lesbian rights\", according to Allen.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=372}} Ultimately, Allen thought that perhaps Tutu's \"greatest legacy\" was the fact that he gave \"to the world as it entered the twenty-first century an African model for expressing the nature of human community\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=396}}\n\nDuring Tutu's rise to notability during the 1970s and 1980s, responses to him were \"sharply polarized\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} Noting that he was \"simultaneously loved and hated, honoured and vilified\",{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=170}} Du Boulay attributed his divisive reception to the fact that \"strong people evoke strong emotions\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}} Tutu gained much adulation from black journalists, inspired imprisoned anti-apartheid activists, and led to many black parents naming their children after him.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=201}} For many black South Africans, he was a respected religious leader and a symbol of black achievement.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=247}} By 1984 he was\u2014according to Gish\u2014\"the personification of the South African freedom struggle\".{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=103}} In 1988, Du Boulay described him as \"a spokesman for his people, a voice for the voiceless\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}}\n\nThe response he received from South Africa's white minority was more mixed. Most of those who criticised him were conservative whites who did not want a shift away from apartheid and white-minority rule.{{sfnm|1a1=Du Boulay|1y=1988|1p=138|2a1=Gish|2y=2004|2p=78}} Many of these whites were angered that he was calling for economic sanctions against South Africa and that he was warning that racial violence was impending.{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=98}} Said whites often accused him of being a tool of the communists.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=236}} This hostility was exacerbated by the government's campaign to discredit Tutu and distort his image,{{sfn|Gish|2004|p=97}} which included repeatedly misquoting him to present his statements out of context.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=263}} According to Du Boulay, the SABC and much of the white press went to \"extraordinary attempts to discredit him\", something that \"made it hard to know the man himself\".{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=18}} Allen noted that in 1984, Tutu was \"the black leader white South Africans most loved to hate\" and that this antipathy extended beyond supporters of the far-right government to liberals too.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=202}} The fact that he was \"an object of hate\" for many was something that deeply pained him.{{sfn|Du Boulay|1988|p=138}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Hated by many white South Africans for being too radical, he was also scorned by many black militants for being too moderate.\n| source=\u2014 On Tutu in the mid-1980s, by Steven D.

It was developed by [[English Electric]] during the mid-to-late 1940s in response to a 1944 [[Air Ministry]] requirement for a successor to the wartime [[de Havilland Mosquito]] fast bomber. Among the performance requirements for the type was the demand for an outstanding high-altitude bombing capability and high speed. These were partly accomplished by making use of newly developed jet propulsion technology. When the Canberra was introduced to service with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the type's first operator, in May 1951, it became the service's first jet-powered bomber.\n\nThroughout most of the 1950s, the Canberra could fly at a higher altitude than any other aircraft in the world. In 1957, a Canberra established a [[Flight altitude record|world altitude record]] of {{convert|70310|ft|m}}. In February 1951, another Canberra set another world record when it became the first jet aircraft to make a non-stop [[transatlantic flight]]. Due to its ability to evade the early [[Jet aircraft|jet]] [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] aircraft and its significant performance advancement over contemporary [[Reciprocating engine|piston]]-engined bombers, the Canberra became a popular aircraft on the export market, being procured for service in the air forces of many nations both inside and outside of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The type was also [[Licensed production|licence produced]] in Australia by the [[Government Aircraft Factories]] and in the US by [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]] as the [[Martin B-57 Canberra|B-57 Canberra]]. The latter produced both slightly modified B-57A Canberra, and the significantly updated B-57B.\n\nIn addition to being a tactical [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear strike]] aircraft, the Canberra proved to be highly adaptable, serving in varied roles such as [[tactical bombing]] and [[Imagery intelligence|photographic]] and [[Electronic intelligence|electronic]] [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]]. Canberras served in the [[Suez Crisis]], [[Vietnam War]], [[Falklands War]], [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|Indo-Pakistani wars]], and numerous African conflicts. In several wars, each of the opposing sides had Canberras in their air forces. The Canberra had a lengthy service life, serving for more than 50 years with some operators. In June 2006, the RAF retired the last of its Canberras, 57 years after its first flight. Three of the [[Martin B-57 Canberra|Martin B-57]] variant remain in service, performing [[Meteorology|meteorological]] work for [[NASA]], as well as providing electronic communication ([[Battlefield Airborne Communications Node]] or BACN) testing for deployment to [[Afghanistan]].<ref>Cenciotti, David.

The [[English Electric]] company mass-produced thousands of [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engined]] bombers, such as the [[Handley Page Hampden]] and [[Handley Page Halifax]], in this manner and the firm thus became a well-established British aircraft manufacturer despite having little internal design experience.<ref name = 'law 66'>Law 2002, p. v66.</ref> [[George Nelson, 1st Baron Nelson of Stafford|Sir George Nelson]], the chairman of English Electric, decided that the company would seek to remain in the business and produce its own designs. In November 1943, the company was invited to participate in discussions over a prospective bomber which would take advantage of the newly developed [[jet propulsion]] technology.<ref name = \"bomber 53\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 53.</ref>\n\nIn 1944, [[Westland Aircraft]]'s technical director and chief designer [[W. E. W. Petter]] had prepared a design study for a twin-engined fighter bomber, the P.1056, based on two fuselage-mounted [[Metropolitan-Vickers F.2|Metrovick F.2/4 \"Beryl\"]] engines. The aircraft used a relatively conventional aerodynamic design, Petter having determined that the necessary performance could be attained without adopting [[swept wing]]s or a swept tail.<ref name = \"bomber 54\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 54.</ref> The authorities doubted its suitability for operations from unprepared fields and at low altitude but could see its potential as a bomber design; numerous manufacturers refused to take on the design.<ref>Buttler 2004, p.&nbsp;213.</ref><ref name = 'petter 52-3'/> Petter left Westland to join the English Electric company in December 1944, where he was appointed by Nelson to form a design team and encouraged to develop his design.<ref name = 'petter 52-3'>Petter-Bowyer 2005, pp.&nbsp;52\u201353.</ref> In 1945, English Electric formalised its own in-house aircraft design team to pursue this design.<ref name = 'law 66'/><ref name = \"bomber 53\"/>\n\nThe Canberra had its formal origins in a 1944 requirement issued by the [[Air Ministry]] for a successor to the [[de Havilland Mosquito]]. This requirement, the initial revision being [[List of Air Ministry specifications|E.3/45]], sought a [[high altitude]], [[high-speed flight|high-speed]] [[bomber]] which was to be equipped with no defensive armament. According to aviation historians [[Bill Gunston]] and Peter Gilchrist, Air Ministry officials are alleged to have had difficulty defining what they sought for the proposed type, which led to several revisions of the requirement.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 53\u201354.</ref> Further specification refinements, including B.3/45 and B.5/47, issued further details such as a three-man crew and other features such as a visual bombing capability. Several British aircraft manufacturers submitted proposals to meet the requirement, including English Electric. The firm was among those companies to be [[short-listed]] to proceed with development studies.<ref name = 'law 66'/>\n\nBy June 1945, the aircraft that was to become the Canberra bore many similarities to the eventual design, despite the placement of a single, centrally mounted turbojet engine; Petter had held discussions with [[Rolls-Royce Ltd]] on the topic of the development of a scaled-up derivative of the [[Rolls-Royce Nene|Nene]] engine.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/> In late 1945, the design was modified further with a pair of engines being adopted instead, initially to be set in the wing roots and later to be mounted in a mid-wing position; this change was made principally due to [[centre of gravity]] issues imposed by the position and weight of a heavy bombload and centrally-mounted single engine.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/><ref name = \"walker 758\">Walker 8 May 1969, p. 758.</ref> The new engine position decreased the aircraft's weight by 13 per cent and improved the aircraft's centre of gravity, as well as improved accessibility to the engines and related accessories, downsides were slightly elevated losses in the longer jet pipes and greater [[yaw (rotation)|yaw]] during engine-out instances.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/>\n\nDuring the early stages of design, the aircraft had grown from being roughly the same size as the Mosquito to being around double its weight.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/> Although jet-powered, the Canberra design philosophy was very much in the Mosquito mould, providing room for a substantial bomb load, fitting two of the most powerful engines available, and wrapping it in the most compact and aerodynamic package possible, an example being a leading edge formed of a single sheet of light alloy wrapped around to 40% of chord, sitting on [[Redux (adhesive)|Redux]]-bonded stiffeners through which the ribs were passed, the panels secured with adjustable eye-bolts, enabling a highly-accurate wing profile to be maintained from the leading edge to main spar without any external joints or fastenings.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Lysander to Lightning Teddy Petter Aircraft Designer|last=Davies|first=Glyn|publisher=The History Press|year=2014|isbn=9780752492117|page=79}}</ref> Also in line with the Mosquito philosophy the Canberra by design dispensed with defensive armament \u2013 which had historically proven unequal to [[fighter aircraft]] \u2013 the resulting performance gain permitting the Canberra to avoid air-to-air combat entirely.<ref name = 'polmar 11'>Polmar 2001, p.&nbsp;11.</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 1946, the [[Ministry of Supply]] placed a contract for the development and production of four English Electric A.1 aircraft.<ref name = \"walker 759\">Walker 8 May 1969, p. 759.</ref> It continued to be known as the English Electric A.1 until it was given the name ''[[Canberra]]'' after the capital of Australia in January 1950 by Sir George Nelson, chairman of English Electric, as Australia had become the aircraft's first export customer.<ref name=\"Ransom176\"/>\n\n===Prototypes and first flights===\n[[File:CanberraVX165.JPG|thumb|alt=The first Canberra B.2 prototype, VX165.|The first Canberra B.2 prototype, VX165]]\n\nThe Air Ministry specification B.3/45 had requested the production of four prototypes. On 9 January 1946, English Electric received a contract to produce four prototypes, which received the [[Society of British Aerospace Companies]] (SBAC) designation ''A.1''; work commenced on the construction of these prototype aircraft in that same year, which were all built on production jigs.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/><ref>''Flight'' 15 December 1949 p. 766.</ref> However, progress was slow due to several factors, such as the protracted development of the Avon engine that powered the type; in October 1947, in response to Rolls-Royce's difficulties, English Electric elected to have the second prototype modified to use the existing Nene engine in place of the Avon.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/> The implementation of post-war military cutbacks also served to slow development.<ref name = \"Wings\"/>\n\nAnother external issue that affected development was the failure of the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] to produce the [[radar]] bombing system for the aircraft in a timely fashion. This required a redesign in 1947, changing the aircraft's nose to accommodate a glazed tip for visual bombing by a bomb aimer, which in turn required the cockpit to be restructured to facilitate the ejection system of the additional crewmember.<ref name = \"bomber 56-57\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 56\u201357.</ref> In 1948, the design team relocated to [[Warton Aerodrome]], Lancashire, establishing a flight test organisation and assembly facilities there.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/>\n\nUltimately, the first of these prototypes, ''VN799'' conducted its [[maiden flight]] in 13 May 1949.<ref name = \"Wings\">Halvorson 2009, pp.&nbsp;10\u201319.</ref> Piloted by [[Roland Beamont]], the aircraft is claimed to have handled well, with the exception of [[rudder]] overbalance. This initial flight was flown with Avon engines, the decision to perform the type's first flight with the Avon-equipped first prototype or the Nene-equipped second prototype, ''VN828'', was not made until weeks beforehand.<ref name = \"bomber 55\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 55.</ref> On 9 November 1949, the second prototype, VN828, the first to be equipped with the Nene engine, performed its first flight. The third and fourth followed within the following eight weeks.<ref name = \"bomber 57\"/>\n\nFlight testing of the prototypes proved to be vice-free and required only a few modifications. The changes included the installation of a glazed nose to accommodate a bomb-aimer, due to the advanced [[H2S radar|H2S]] Mk9 bombing radar being unavailable for production, the turbojet engines were replaced by more powerful [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] R.A.3s, and distinctive teardrop-shaped fuel tanks were fitted under the wingtips.<ref name = \"Wings\"/> Refinements were also made following early flight testing to the rudder and [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]] to reduce instances of [[Buffeting|buffeting]], after which it is claimed that the Canberra handled much like a fighter, proving to be atypically manoeuvrable for a bomber.<ref name = \"bomber 56\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 56.</ref>\n\nThe project had found considerable support from the government in the late 1940s. In March 1949, in advance of the maiden flight of the first prototype, English Electric received an instruction to proceed for production.<ref name = \"bomber 57\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 57.</ref> By the time the first prototype had flown, the Air Ministry had placed orders for 132 production aircraft in bomber, reconnaissance, and training variants. On 21 April 1950, the first production-standard aircraft, [[British military aircraft designation systems|designated]] as the Canberra B.2, conducted its maiden flight, piloted by Beamont. Proving to be free of problems, this first flight was almost immediately followed by the mainstream manufacturing of production Canberras. In May 1951, the Canberra entered RAF squadron service, [[No. 101 Squadron RAF|No. 101 Squadron]] being the first to receive the type.<ref name = \"walker 759\"/> In a testament to the aircraft's benign handling characteristics, the transition programme for the Canberra consisted of only 20 hours in the [[Gloster Meteor]] and three hours in a dual-control Canberra trainer.<ref name=\"walker 758 761\"/>\n\n===Production and licensed manufacturing===\nIn July 1949, as English Electric was in the process of setting up production at [[Samlesbury Aerodrome]], a firm order was placed for 132 Canberras. The order consisted of 90 B.5/47 bomber-type aircraft, 34 PR.31/46 photo reconnaissance aircraft, and 8 T.2/49 trainer aircraft.<ref name = \"bomber 57\"/> On 25 June 1950, what would become known as the [[Korean War]] broke out; this led to a surge of demand for the Canberra and the British government stepping in to establish a far greater level of wartime production. This led to a succession of orders for Canberra B.2s, the initial bomber variant, being placed with [[Avro]], [[Handley Page]], and [[Short Brothers]]; for British needs alone, English Electric produced 196 B.2s, Avro and Handley Page manufactured 75 each, and Short completed 60 aircraft \u2013 the B.2 variant of the Canberra exceeded the numbers built of any other version.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p.&nbsp;508.</ref> Other nations, notably Australia and the United States of America, also ordered large numbers of Canberras.<ref name = \"bomber 57\"/>\n\n[[File:EB-57B 01.jpg|thumb|left|Martin EB-57B]]\nIn the United States, the [[US Air Force]] had identified the need to replace the obsolete [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26 Invader]] and had determined that, at the time, no home-produced aircraft designs could get close to what the Canberra could already offer. Following a competition against rivals such as the [[Martin XB-51]], it was decided to order a total of 403 Canberras. These aircraft were [[licence-built]] by [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]] as the [[Martin B-57 Canberra|B-57 Canberra]]. Martin would develop several versions of the aircraft themselves.<ref name='Don'>Donald 1986, p.&nbsp;18.</ref> The first examples were identical to the original English Electric aircraft, following which tandem crew seating was introduced, but later B-57 models were considerably modified.\n\nAustralia had been interested in the Canberra early on, which had led to the aircraft being named after the Australian capital city. Particular interest had at one time been expressed in a potential [[Rolls-Royce RB.44 Tay|Rolls-Royce Tay]] powered version of the aircraft.<ref name = \"bomber 57\"/> The [[Government Aircraft Factories]] (GAF) locally assembled 48 for the [[Royal Australian Air Force]].<ref name = \"Wings\"/><ref name='Don' /> These aircraft were broadly similar to the British B.2. Changes included the adoption of a modified leading edge, increased fuel capacity and room for three [[Coffman engine starter|starter cartridges]], although in practice all three cartridges would sometimes fire, leading to the triple starter units being loaded singly.<ref>Wilson, Stewart.

It was built in 27 versions that equipped a total of 35 RAF squadrons, and was exported to more than 15 countries, including Australia, Argentina, [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Ethiopia]], France, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, [[Peru]], [[Rhodesia]], South Africa, Sweden, [[Venezuela]] and West Germany.<ref name=\"walker 758 761\">Walker 8 May 1969, pp. 758, 760\u2013761.</ref>\n\n===Photo-reconnaissance and specialised roles===\nDuring the latter part of the Second World War, strategic reconnaissance missions performed by the RAF had been carried out by the de Havilland Mosquito.

The PR.7 featured greater fuel capacity via wing storage, the more powerful RA.7 model of the Avon engine, and [[Maxaret]] [[anti-lock braking system]].<ref name = \"bomber 59\"/> The Canberra PR.9 was the final photo reconnaissance version; this aircraft was furnished with a new crew compartment, a redesigned inner wing section, and much more powerful RA.24 Avon engine.<ref name = \"bomber 59\"/> In later service, bomber models of the Canberra were often converted with cameras and other equipment suited for reconnaissance purposes.<ref name = \"bomber 60\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 60.</ref>\n\nTo enable crews to convert to flying the Canberra, a trainer version was developed to meet Air Ministry Specification T.2/49.<ref name=\"Ransom161\">Ransom and Fairclough 1987, p.&nbsp;161.</ref> On 12 June 1951, the prototype, designated T.4, conducted its first flight.<ref name=\"Ransom173\">Ransom and Fairclough 1987, p.&nbsp;173.</ref> It was the same basic design as the B.2 apart from the introduction of side by side seating for the pilot and the instructor and the replacement of the glazed nose with a solid nose.<ref name=\"Ransom173\" /> The first production T.4 flew on 20 September 1953 and the variant entered service with [[No. 231 Operational Conversion Unit RAF]] in early 1954.<ref name=\"Ransom176\">Ransom and Fairclough 1987, p.&nbsp;176.</ref><ref name=\"Ransom179\">Ransom and Fairclough 1987, p.&nbsp;179</ref> In addition to those assigned to the operational conversion unit, all of the B.2 equipped bomber squadrons received at least one T.4 for training purposes.<ref name=\"Ransom179\" />\n\nIn addition to the RAF, other users adopted the Canberra in the trainer role.

An early prototype operated by Rolls-Royce would regularly fly to 63,000 feet, where the usable speed range ([[Coffin corner (aviation)|coffin corner]]) was only 25 knots, during Avon engine test flights.<ref>Men of Power The Lives of Rolls-Royce Chief Test Pilots Harvey & Jim Heyworth, Robert Jackson 2006, Pen & Sword Books Limited, {{ISBN|1 84415 427 0}}, p.130</ref> The overall design has been described as being of a simple nature, somewhat resembling a scaled-up Gloster Meteor fighter, except for its use of a [[mid wing]].<ref name = 'flight 15 766'/> The Canberra principally differed from its preceding piston-powered wartime bombers by its use of twin Rolls-Royce Avon [[turbojet]] engines.<ref name = \"bomber 55\"/> The fuselage was circular in cross section, tapered at both ends and, cockpit aside, entirely without protrusions; the line of the large, low-[[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] wings was broken only by the tubular engine [[nacelle]]s.<ref name = 'flight 15 766'>''Flight,'' 15 December 1949, p.&nbsp;766.</ref> The Canberra had a two-man crew in a fighter-style cabin with a large blown canopy, but delays in the development of the intended automatic radar [[bombsight]] resulted in the addition of a bomb aimer's position housed within the nose.<ref name = \"bomber 56\"/> The pilot and navigator were positioned in a [[tandem]] arrangement on [[Martin-Baker]] ejection seats.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 55-56.</ref>\n\nThe wing is of single-spar construction that passes through the aircraft's fuselage. The wingspan and total length of the Canberra are almost identical at just under {{convert|20|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on|round=5}}. Outboard of the engine [[nacelles]], the wing has a [[leading edge]] sweep of 4\u00b0 and trailing edge sweep of \u221214\u00b0. All [[flight control]]s are manual, using push-rods rather than cables, but are otherwise conventional. These actuate the aircraft's [[flight control surface]]s, including shrouded-nosed [[aileron]]s, four-section conventional split-type [[flap (aeronautics)|flaps]], and atypical [[Air brake (aircraft)|airbrakes]] which comprise 40 [[hydraulics|hydraulically-raised]] fingers located on the top and bottom surfaces of the wings.<ref name = \"bomber 55\"/><ref name = 'flight 15 full'>''Flight'' 15 December 1949, pp.&nbsp;766\u2013772.</ref> Swept-wings were considered, but not adopted, since the expected operational speeds did not warrant them and because they could have introduced new aerodynamic problems into what was otherwise anticipated to be a straightforward replacement for RAF [[Hawker Typhoon]] and [[Westland Whirlwind (fighter)|Westland Whirlwind]] fighter-bombers.<ref name = \"walker 758\"/>\n\n[[File:EE Canberra instument panel, Midland Air Museum.

The whole lower section of the fuselage is taken up by the sizeable bomb bay with a pair of hydraulically-driven doors.<ref name = \"bomber 56\"/> The Canberra's undercarriage used a simple arrangement, the main [[landing gear]] being equipped with a single outboard-mounted wheel and the nose gear being a twin-wheel arrangement.<ref name = \"bomber 56\"/> Due to the use of a new alloy, DTD683, the undercarriage suffered from stress corrosion cracking. Cracks would appear within only a few years.<ref>Jefford 2001, p.&nbsp;124.</ref> The hazard posed by an undercarriage collapse during landing led the RAF to institute regular inspections, at first using [[radiography]] before moving to more effective and reliable [[ultrasound]] technology.<ref>Jefford 2001, p.&nbsp;125.</ref> The Canberra structure is mainly metal, with only the forward portion of the tail-fin made from wood.<ref>Halpenny 2005, p.&nbsp;59.</ref>\n\nThrust was provided by a pair of {{cvt|30|kN|lbf|order=flip}} axial flow Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines. They were mounted in the midsection of the wings using tubular trusses and links between the main mounts and the adjacent leading edge of the wing.<ref name = \"bomber 55\"/> Each engine drove a 6&nbsp;kW generator for the aircraft 28&nbsp;V [[direct current|DC]] electrical system, a hydraulic pump for the aircraft hydraulics and a [[bleed air]] system for [[cabin pressurisation]]. Fuel was carried in two internally-supported [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s and a lace-supported bag in the upper fuselage.<ref name = \"bomber 55\"/> The manufacturer specified that Coffman engine starters should be used for engine starting. An improvised method using compressed air was discouraged by Rolls-Royce, but some operators used air-starting successfully, the benefit being significant cost savings over the use of cartridges.<ref>Petter-Bowyer 2005, pp.&nbsp;95\u201396.</ref>\n\nVarious avionics were installed on the Canberra, many with their origins during the Second World War. They included [[Gee-H (navigation)|Gee-H navigation]], [[Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar|Rebecca beacon-interrogation distance-measuring equipment]], [[very high frequency]] (VHF) radio, [[radio compass]], [[radar altimeter]], [[identification friend or foe]] (IFF), and [[List of Rainbow Codes#Orange Putter|Orange Putter]] [[radar warning receiver]].<ref name = \"bomber 56\"/> Perhaps the most crucial of the mission systems was the [[H2S (radar)|H2S]] automatic radar bombsight, which was mounted in the nose; delays in the development of the H2S intended for the Canberra led to early aircraft being fitted with a T.2 [[optical sight]] for visual bombing.

It was developed by [[English Electric]] during the mid-to-late 1940s in response to a 1944 [[Air Ministry]] requirement for a successor to the wartime [[de Havilland Mosquito]] fast bomber. Among the performance requirements for the type was the demand for an outstanding high-altitude bombing capability and high speed. These were partly accomplished by making use of newly developed jet propulsion technology. When the Canberra was introduced to service with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the type's first operator, in May 1951, it became the service's first jet-powered bomber.\n\nThroughout most of the 1950s, the Canberra could fly at a higher altitude than any other aircraft in the world. In 1957, a Canberra established a [[Flight altitude record|world altitude record]] of {{convert|70310|ft|m}}. In February 1951, another Canberra set another world record when it became the first jet aircraft to make a non-stop [[transatlantic flight]]. Due to its ability to evade the early [[Jet aircraft|jet]] [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] aircraft and its significant performance advancement over contemporary [[Reciprocating engine|piston]]-engined bombers, the Canberra became a popular aircraft on the export market, being procured for service in the air forces of many nations both inside and outside of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The type was also [[Licensed production|licence produced]] in Australia by the [[Government Aircraft Factories]] and in the US by [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]] as the [[Martin B-57 Canberra|B-57 Canberra]. The latter produced both slightly modified B-57A Canberra, and the significantly updated B-57B.\n\nIn addition to being a tactical [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear strike]] aircraft, the Canberra proved to be highly adaptable, serving in varied roles such as [[tactical bombing]] and [[Imagery intelligence|photographic]] and [[Electronic intelligence|electronic]] [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]]. Canberras served in the [[Suez Crisis]], [[Vietnam War]], [[Falklands War]], [[Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts|Indo-Pakistani wars]], and numerous African conflicts. In several wars, each of the opposing sides had Canberras in their air forces. The Canberra had a lengthy service life, serving for more than 50 years with some operators. In June 2006, the RAF retired the last of its Canberras, 57 years after its first flight. Three of the [[Martin B-57 Canberra|Martin B-57]] variant remain in service, performing [[Meteorology|meteorological]] work for [[NASA]], as well as providing electronic communication ([[Battlefield Airborne Communications Node]] or BACN) testing for deployment to [[Afghanistan]].<ref>Cenciotti, David.

The [[English Electric]] company mass-produced thousands of [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engined]] bombers, such as the [[Handley Page Hampden]] and [[Handley Page Halifax]], in this manner and the firm thus became a well-established British aircraft manufacturer despite having little internal design experience.<ref name = 'law 66'>Law 2002, p. v66.</ref> [[George Nelson, 1st Baron Nelson of Stafford|Sir George Nelson]], the chairman of English Electric, decided that the company would seek to remain in the business and produce its own designs. In November 1943, the company was invited to participate in discussions over a prospective bomber which would take advantage of the newly developed [[jet propulsion]] technology.<ref name = \"bomber 53\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 53.</ref>\n\nIn 1944, [[Westland Aircraft]]'s technical director and chief designer [[W. E. W. Petter]] had prepared a design study for a twin-engined fighter bomber, the P.1056, based on two fuselage-mounted [[Metropolitan-Vickers F.2|Metrovick F.2/4 \"Beryl\"]] engines. The aircraft used a relatively conventional aerodynamic design, Petter having determined that the necessary performance could be attained without adopting [[swept wing]]s or a swept tail.<ref name = \"bomber 54\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 54.</ref> The authorities doubted its suitability for operations from unprepared fields and at low altitude but could see its potential as a bomber design; numerous manufacturers refused to take on the design.<ref>Buttler 2004, p.&nbsp;213.</ref><ref name = 'petter 52-3'/> Petter left Westland to join the English Electric company in December 1944, where he was appointed by Nelson to form a design team and encouraged to develop his design.<ref name = 'petter 52-3'>Petter-Bowyer 2005, pp.&nbsp;52\u201353.</ref> In 1945, English Electric formalised its own in-house aircraft design team to pursue this design.<ref name = 'law 66'/><ref name = \"bomber 53\"/>\n\nThe Canberra had its formal origins in a 1944 requirement issued by the [[Air Ministry]] for a successor to the [[de Havilland Mosquito]]. This requirement, the initial revision being [[List of Air Ministry specifications|E.3/45]], sought a [[high altitude]], [[high-speed flight|high-speed]] [[bomber]] which was to be equipped with no defensive armament. According to aviation historians [[Bill Gunston]] and Peter Gilchrist, Air Ministry officials are alleged to have had difficulty defining what they sought for the proposed type, which led to several revisions of the requirement.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 53\u201354.</ref> Further specification refinements, including B.3/45 and B.5/47, issued further details such as a three-man crew and other features such as a visual bombing capability. Several British aircraft manufacturers submitted proposals to meet the requirement, including English Electric. The firm was among those companies to be [[short-listed]] to proceed with development studies.<ref name = 'law 66'/>\n\nBy June 1945, the aircraft that was to become the Canberra bore many similarities to the eventual design, despite the placement of a single, centrally mounted turbojet engine; Petter had held discussions with [[Rolls-Royce Ltd]] on the topic of the development of a scaled-up derivative of the [[Rolls-Royce Nene|Nene]] engine.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/> In late 1945, the design was modified further with a pair of engines being adopted instead, initially to be set in the wing roots and later to be mounted in a mid-wing position; this change was made principally due to [[centre of gravity]] issues imposed by the position and weight of a heavy bombload and centrally-mounted single engine.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/><ref name = \"walker 758\">Walker 8 May 1969, p. 758.</ref> The new engine position decreased the aircraft's weight by 13 per cent and improved the aircraft's centre of gravity, as well as improved accessibility to the engines and related accessories, downsides were slightly elevated losses in the longer jet pipes and greater [[yaw (rotation)|yaw]] during engine-out instances.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/>\n\nDuring the early stages of design, the aircraft had grown from being roughly the same size as the Mosquito to being around double its weight.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/> Although jet-powered, the Canberra design philosophy was very much in the Mosquito mould, providing room for a substantial bomb load, fitting two of the most powerful engines available, and wrapping it in the most compact and aerodynamic package possible, an example being a leading edge formed of a single sheet of light alloy wrapped around to 40% of chord, sitting on [[Redux (adhesive)|Redux]]-bonded stiffeners through which the ribs were passed, the panels secured with adjustable eye-bolts, enabling a highly-accurate wing profile to be maintained from the leading edge to main spar without any external joints or fastenings.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Lysander to Lightning Teddy Petter Aircraft Designer|last=Davies|first=Glyn|publisher=The History Press|year=2014|isbn=9780752492117|page=79}}</ref> Also in line with the Mosquito philosophy the Canberra by design dispensed with defensive armament \u2013 which had historically proven unequal to [[fighter aircraft]] \u2013 the resulting performance gain permitting the Canberra to avoid air-to-air combat entirely.<ref name = 'polmar 11'>Polmar 2001, p.&nbsp;11.</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 1946, the [[Ministry of Supply]] placed a contract for the development and production of four English Electric A.1 aircraft.<ref name = \"walker 759\">Walker 8 May 1969, p. 759.</ref> It continued to be known as the English Electric A.1 until it was given the name ''[[Canberra]]'' after the capital of Australia in January 1950 by Sir George Nelson, chairman of English Electric, as Australia had become the aircraft's first export customer.<ref name=\"Ransom176\"/>\n\n===Prototypes and first flights===\n[[File:CanberraVX165.JPG|thumb|alt=The first Canberra B.2 prototype, VX165.|The first Canberra B.2 prototype, VX165]]\n\nThe Air Ministry specification B.3/45 had requested the production of four prototypes. On 9 January 1946, English Electric received a contract to produce four prototypes, which received the [[Society of British Aerospace Companies]] (SBAC) designation ''A.1''; work commenced on the construction of these prototype aircraft in that same year, which were all built on production jigs.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/><ref>''Flight'' 15 December 1949 p. 766.</ref> However, progress was slow due to several factors, such as the protracted development of the Avon engine that powered the type; in October 1947, in response to Rolls-Royce's difficulties, English Electric elected to have the second prototype modified to use the existing Nene engine in place of the Avon.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/> The implementation of post-war military cutbacks also served to slow development.<ref name = \"Wings\"/>\n\nAnother external issue that affected development was the failure of the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] to produce the [[radar]] bombing system for the aircraft in a timely fashion. This required a redesign in 1947, changing the aircraft's nose to accommodate a glazed tip for visual bombing by a bomb aimer, which in turn required the cockpit to be restructured to facilitate the ejection system of the additional crewmember.<ref name = \"bomber 56-57\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 56\u201357.</ref> In 1948, the design team relocated to [[Warton Aerodrome]], Lancashire, establishing a flight test organisation and assembly facilities there.<ref name = \"bomber 54\"/>\n\nUltimately, the first of these prototypes, ''VN799'' conducted its [[maiden flight]] in 13 May 1949.<ref name = \"Wings\">Halvorson 2009, pp.&nbsp;10\u201319.</ref> Piloted by [[Roland Beamont]], the aircraft is claimed to have handled well, with the exception of [[rudder]] overbalance. This initial flight was flown with Avon engines, the decision to perform the type's first flight with the Avon-equipped first prototype or the Nene-equipped second prototype, ''VN828'', was not made until weeks beforehand.<ref name = \"bomber 55\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 55.</ref> On 9 November 1949, the second prototype, VN828, the first to be equipped with the Nene engine, performed its first flight. The third and fourth followed within the following eight weeks.<ref name = \"bomber 57\"/>\n\nFlight testing of the prototypes proved to be vice-free and required only a few modifications. The changes included the installation of a glazed nose to accommodate a bomb-aimer, due to the advanced [[H2S radar|H2S]] Mk9 bombing radar being unavailable for production, the turbojet engines were replaced by more powerful [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] R.A.3s, and distinctive teardrop-shaped fuel tanks were fitted under the wingtips.<ref name = \"Wings\"/> Refinements were also made following early flight testing to the rudder and [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]] to reduce instances of [[Buffeting|buffeting]], after which it is claimed that the Canberra handled much like a fighter, proving to be atypically manoeuvrable for a bomber.<ref name = \"bomber 56\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 56.</ref>\n\nThe project had found considerable support from the government in the late 1940s. In March 1949, in advance of the maiden flight of the first prototype, English Electric received an instruction to proceed for production.<ref name = \"bomber 57\">Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 57.</ref> By the time the first prototype had flown, the Air Ministry had placed orders for 132 production aircraft in bomber, reconnaissance, and training variants. On 21 April 1950, the first production-standard aircraft, [[British military aircraft designation systems|designated]] as the Canberra B.2, conducted its maiden flight, piloted by Beamont. Proving to be free of problems, this first flight was almost immediately followed by the mainstream manufacturing of production Canberras. In May 1951, the Canberra entered RAF squadron service, [[No. 101 Squadron RAF|No. 101 Squadron]] being the first to receive the type.<ref name = \"walker 759\"/> In a testament to the aircraft's benign handling characteristics, the transition programme for the Canberra consisted of only 20 hours in the [[Gloster Meteor]] and three hours in a dual-control Canberra trainer.<ref name=\"walker 758 761\"/>\n\n===Production and licensed manufacturing===\nIn July 1949, as English Electric was in the process of setting up production at [[Samlesbury Aerodrome]], a firm order was placed for 132 Canberras. The order consisted of 90 B.5/47 bomber-type aircraft, 34 PR.31/46 photo reconnaissance aircraft, and 8 T.2/49 trainer aircraft.<ref name = \"bomber 57\"/> On 25 June 1950, what would become known as the [[Korean War]] broke out; this led to a surge of demand for the Canberra and the British government stepping in to establish a far greater level of wartime production. This led to a succession of orders for Canberra B.2s, the initial bomber variant, being placed with [[Avro]], [[Handley Page]], and [[Short Brothers]]; for British needs alone, English Electric produced 196 B.2s, Avro and Handley Page manufactured 75 each, and Short completed 60 aircraft \u2013 the B.2 variant of the Canberra exceeded the numbers built of any other version.<ref>Barnes and James 1989, p.&nbsp;508.</ref> Other nations, notably Australia and the United States of America, also ordered large numbers of Canberras.<ref name = \"bomber 57\"/>\n\n[[File:EB-57B 01.jpg|thumb|left|Martin EB-57B]]\nIn the United States, the [[US Air Force]] had identified the need to replace the obsolete [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26 Invader]] and had determined that, at the time, no home-produced aircraft designs could get close to what the Canberra could already offer. Following a competition against rivals such as the [[Martin XB-51]], it was decided to order a total of 403 Canberras. These aircraft were [[licence-built]] by [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]] as the [[Martin B-57 Canberra|B-57 Canberra]]. Martin would develop several versions of the aircraft themselves.<ref name='Don'>Donald 1986, p.&nbsp;18.</ref> The first examples were identical to the original English Electric aircraft, following which tandem crew seating was introduced, but later B-57 models were considerably modified.\n\nAustralia had been interested in the Canberra early on, which had led to the aircraft being named after the Australian capital city. Particular interest had at one time been expressed in a potential [[Rolls-Royce RB.44 Tay|Rolls-Royce Tay]] powered version of the aircraft.<ref name = \"bomber 57\"/> The [[Government Aircraft Factories]] (GAF) locally assembled 48 for the [[Royal Australian Air Force]].<ref name = \"Wings\"/><ref name='Don' /> These aircraft were broadly similar to the British B.2. Changes included the adoption of a modified leading edge, increased fuel capacity and room for three [[Coffman engine starter|starter cartridges]], although in practice all three cartridges would sometimes fire, leading to the triple starter units being loaded singly.<ref>Wilson, Stewart. ''Lincoln, Canberra and F-111 in Australian Service.''

An early prototype operated by Rolls-Royce would regularly fly to 63,000 feet, where the usable speed range ([[Coffin corner (aviation)|coffin corner]]) was only 25 knots, during Avon engine test flights.<ref>Men of Power The Lives of Rolls-Royce Chief Test Pilots Harvey & Jim Heyworth, Robert Jackson 2006, Pen & Sword Books Limited, {{ISBN|1 84415 427 0}}, p.130</ref> The overall design has been described as being of a simple nature, somewhat resembling a scaled-up Gloster Meteor fighter, except for its use of a [[mid wing]].<ref name = 'flight 15 766'/> The Canberra principally differed from its preceding piston-powered wartime bombers by its use of twin Rolls-Royce Avon [[turbojet]] engines.<ref name = \"bomber 55\"/> The fuselage was circular in cross section, tapered at both ends and, cockpit aside, entirely without protrusions; the line of the large, low-[[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] wings was broken only by the tubular engine [[nacelle]]s.<ref name = 'flight 15 766'>''Flight,'' 15 December 1949, p.&nbsp;766.</ref> The Canberra had a two-man crew in a fighter-style cabin with a large blown canopy, but delays in the development of the intended automatic radar [[bombsight]] resulted in the addition of a bomb aimer's position housed within the nose.<ref name = \"bomber 56\"/> The pilot and navigator were positioned in a [[tandem]] arrangement on [[Martin-Baker]] ejection seats.<ref>Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 55-56.</ref>\n\nThe wing is of single-spar construction that passes through the aircraft's fuselage. The wingspan and total length of the Canberra are almost identical at just under {{convert|20|m|ft|order=flip|abbr=on|round=5}}. Outboard of the engine [[nacelles]], the wing has a [[leading edge]] sweep of 4\u00b0 and trailing edge sweep of \u221214\u00b0. All [[flight control]]s are manual, using push-rods rather than cables, but are otherwise conventional. These actuate the aircraft's [[flight control surface]]s, including shrouded-nosed [[aileron]]s, four-section conventional split-type [[flap (aeronautics)|flaps]], and atypical [[Air brake (aircraft)|airbrakes]] which comprise 40 [[hydraulics|hydraulically-raised]] fingers located on the top and bottom surfaces of the wings.<ref name = \"bomber 55\"/><ref name = 'flight 15 full'>''Flight'' 15 December 1949, pp.&nbsp;766\u2013772.</ref> Swept-wings were considered, but not adopted, since the expected operational speeds did not warrant them and because they could have introduced new aerodynamic problems into what was otherwise anticipated to be a straightforward replacement for RAF [[Hawker Typhoon]] and [[Westland Whirlwind (fighter)|Westland Whirlwind]] fighter-bombers.<ref name = \"walker 758\"/>\n\n[[File:EE Canberra instument panel, Midland Air Museum. (12780760883).jpg|thumb|left|Instrument panel of a Canberra cockpit, 2006]]\nThe fuselage of the Canberra is of semi-[[monocoque]] construction with a pressurised nose compartment. The whole lower section of the fuselage is taken up by the sizeable bomb bay with a pair of hydraulically-driven doors.<ref name = \"bomber 56\"/> The Canberra's undercarriage used a simple arrangement, the main [[landing gear]] being equipped with a single outboard-mounted wheel and the nose gear being a twin-wheel arrangement.<ref name = \"bomber 56\"/> Due to the use of a new alloy, DTD683, the undercarriage suffered from stress corrosion cracking. Cracks would appear within only a few years.<ref>Jefford 2001, p.&nbsp;124.</ref> The hazard posed by an undercarriage collapse during landing led the RAF to institute regular inspections, at first using [[radiography]] before moving to more effective and reliable [[ultrasound]] technology.<ref>Jefford 2001, p.&nbsp;125.</ref> The Canberra structure is mainly metal, with only the forward portion of the tail-fin made from wood.<ref>Halpenny 2005, p.&nbsp;59.</ref>\n\nThrust was provided by a pair of {{cvt|30|kN|lbf|order=flip}} axial flow Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines. They were mounted in the midsection of the wings using tubular trusses and links between the main mounts and the adjacent leading edge of the wing.<ref name = \"bomber 55\"/> Each engine drove a 6&nbsp;kW generator for the aircraft 28&nbsp;V [[direct current|DC]] electrical system, a hydraulic pump for the aircraft hydraulics and a [[bleed air]] system for [[cabin pressurisation]]. Fuel was carried in two internally-supported [[self-sealing fuel tank]]s and a lace-supported bag in the upper fuselage.<ref name = \"bomber 55\"/> The manufacturer specified that Coffman engine starters should be used for engine starting. An improvised method using compressed air was discouraged by Rolls-Royce, but some operators used air-starting successfully, the benefit being significant cost savings over the use of cartridges.<ref>Petter-Bowyer 2005, pp.&nbsp;95\u201396.</ref>\n\nVarious avionics were installed on the Canberra, many with their origins during the Second World War. They included [[Gee-H (navigation)|Gee-H navigation]], [[Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar|Rebecca beacon-interrogation distance-measuring equipment]], [[very high frequency]] (VHF) radio, [[radio compass]], [[radar altimeter]], [[identification friend or foe]] (IFF), and [[List of Rainbow Codes#Orange Putter|Orange Putter]] [[radar warning receiver]].<ref name = \"bomber 56\"/> Perhaps the most crucial of the mission systems was the [[H2S (radar)|H2S]] automatic radar bombsight, which was mounted in the nose; delays in the development of the H2S intended for the Canberra led to early aircraft being fitted with a T.2 [[optical sight]] for visual bombing.

In 1922, he formed a company, Birdseye Seafood, Inc., to freeze fish fillets with chilled air at -45 \u00b0F (-43 \u00b0C). In 1924, he developed an entirely new process for commercially viable quick-freezing: packing fish in cartons, then freezing the contents between two refrigerated surfaces under pressure. Birdseye created a new company, General Seafood Corporation, to promote this method. In 1929, Birdseye sold his company and patents for $22 million to Goldman Sachs and the Postum Company, which eventually became General Foods Corporation, and which founded the Birds Eye Frozen Food Company.
