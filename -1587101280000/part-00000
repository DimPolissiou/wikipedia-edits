Well known for its members' face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid-to-late 1970s with their [[shock rock|elaborate]] live performances, which featured [[fire breathing]], blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits, and [[pyrotechnics]]. The band has gone through several lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons being the only members to feature in every lineup. The original and best-known lineup consisted of Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Simmons (vocals and bass), Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Criss (drums and vocals).\n\nWith their make-up and costumes, they took on the personae of comic book-style characters: the Starchild (Stanley), the Demon (Simmons), the Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and the Catman (Criss). Due to creative differences, both Criss and Frehley had departed the group by 1982.\n\nIn 1983, Kiss began performing without makeup and costumes, thus marking the beginning of the band's \"unmasked\" era that would last for over a decade. They accordingly experienced a commercial resurgence, with the [[RIAA certification#List of certifications|platinum certified]] album ''[[Lick It Up]]'' successfully introducing them to a new generation of fans, and their music videos received regular airplay on [[MTV]]. [[Eric Carr]], who had replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of [[heart cancer]] and was replaced by [[Eric Singer]]. In response to a wave of Kiss [[nostalgia]] in the mid-1990s, the original lineup re-united in 1996, which also saw the return of their makeup and stage costumes. The resulting [[Alive/Worldwide Tour]] was highly successful, grossing $143.7&nbsp;million, making it their most successful tour to date. Criss and Frehley have both since left the band again and have been replaced by Singer and [[Tommy Thayer]]. The band has continued with their original stage makeup, with Singer and Thayer using the original Catman and Spaceman makeup, respectively. In September 2018, Kiss announced that, after 45 years of recording and performing, they would be embarking on their final tour, [[End of the Road World Tour|The End of the Road World Tour]], in 2019, with the final show confirmed for July 17, 2021 in New York City where the band formed back in 1973, with additional shows added.<ref name=\"farewell tour 2019\">{{cite news|title=It's Official: KISS To Launch Farewell Tour, 'End Of The Road', In 2019|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/its-official-kiss-to-launch-farewell-tour-end-of-the-road-in-january/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=September 20, 2018|date=September 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/gene-simmons-says-kisss-end-of-the-road-tour-could-last-more-than-three-years/|title=GENE SIMMONS Says KISS's 'End Of The Road' Tour Could Last More Than Three Years|publisher=Blabbermouth|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kiss-to-launch-three-year-world-tour-in-january-2019-says-gene-simmons/|title=KISS To Launch Three Year Tour In January 2019, Says GENE SIMMONS|publisher=Blabbermouth|date=June 4, 2018|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-final-concert/|title=Kiss Reveal Date and Location of Final 'End of the Road' Concert|publisher=Ultimate Classic Rock|date=November 2, 2019|accessdate=November 2, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-2020-tour-dates/|title=Kiss Reveal 75 New 2020 \u2018End of the Road\u2019 Tour Dates|last=Kielty|first=Martin|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\nKiss is [[List of best-selling music artists|one of the best-selling bands of all time]], having sold more than 75&nbsp;million records worldwide, including 21<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|title=Gold & Platinum|website=RIAA|accessdate=October 8, 2019}}</ref> million [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified albums.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/sep/22/rooted-in-enjoyment-20170922/|title=Rooted In Enjoyment|first=Becca|last=Martin-Brown|work=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]|date=September 22, 2017|accessdate=May 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=RIAA Top Selling Artists |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=top_tallies&ttt=TAA#search_section |accessdate=June 13, 2017}}</ref> Kiss also holds the title as America's #1 Gold record award-winning group of all time, having earned 30 Gold albums.

They recorded one album, which was shelved by [[Epic Records]], and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 14.</ref><ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 68\u201371.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nAfter abandoning the name Wicked Lester late in 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] version of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed by [[Peter Criss]], a veteran drummer from the New York City scene who had previously played in the bands Lips and [[Chelsea (American band)|Chelsea]]. Simmons and Stanley met Criss in a nightclub where he was playing drums. After hearing Criss sing, they thought Criss should be in the new band they were forming. Criss then auditioned for, and later joined their new band. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than what Wicked Lester played. They also began experimenting with their image, by wearing makeup and various outfits.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 33, 57\u201358.</ref> In November 1972, the trio played a showcase for Epic Records [[A&R]] director Don Ellis, in an effort to secure a record deal. Although the performance went well, Ellis disliked the group's image and music.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist [[Ace Frehley]]. Frehley impressed the group with his first audition, although he showed up wearing two different colored sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the classic lineup was solidified as the band to be named Kiss.<ref name=\"acebio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kayosproductions.com/artists.php?id=57|title=Artist bio: Ace Frehley|publisher=Kayos Productions|accessdate=January 6, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080049/http://www.kayosproductions.com/artists.php?id=57|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}</ref>\n[[File:Kiss Logo.svg|thumb|upright|The Kiss logo]]\nStanley came up with the name while he, Simmons and Criss were driving around New York City.

However, Simmons and Stanley, both Jewish, have denied any intentional likeness to Nazi symbolism in the logo. Since 1979, most of the band's album covers and merchandise in Germany have used an alternate logo, in which the letters \"SS\" look like the letters \"ZZ\" backwards. This logo is also used in [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Hungary]] and [[Israel]] to avoid controversy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe band's name has repeatedly been the subject of rumors pertaining to alleged hidden meanings. Among these rumors are claims that the name is an acronym for \"Knights in Satan's Service\", \"Kinder SS\", or \"Kids in Satan's Service\".

For the first three gigs, January 30 to February 1, they wore little to no makeup; the iconic makeup designs associated with Kiss made their debut during the March 9\u201310 shows at The Daisy in [[Amityville, New York]]. On March 13 of that year, the band recorded a five-song demo tape with producer [[Eddie Kramer]]. Former TV director [[Bill Aucoin]], who had seen the group at a handful of showcase concerts in the summer of 1973, offered to become the band's manager in mid-October. Kiss agreed, with the condition that Aucoin sign the band to a record label within two weeks. On November 1, 1973, Kiss became the first act signed to former teen pop singer and [[Buddah Records]] executive [[Neil Bogart]]'s new label, [[Casablanca Records]].<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 145\u2013146.</ref>\n\nThe band entered Bell Sound Studios in New York City on October 10, 1973, to begin recording their first album. On December 31, the band had their official industry premiere at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music|Academy of Music]] in New York City, opening for [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]. It was at this concert that Simmons accidentally set his hair (which was coated in hairspray) ablaze for the first of many times while performing his fire-breathing routine.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 27.</ref>\n\nKiss' first tour started on February 5, 1974, in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], at the [[Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium]], as an opening act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kissonline.com/history|title=Kiss Chronology|work=kissonline.com|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}</ref> The band's [[Kiss (Kiss album)|self-titled debut album]] was released on February 8. Casablanca and Kiss promoted the album heavily throughout the spring and summer of 1974. On February 19, the band performed \"[[Nothin' to Lose (Kiss song)|Nothin' to Lose]]\", \"[[Firehouse (Kiss song)|Firehouse]]\" and \"[[Black Diamond (Kiss song)|Black Diamond]]\" on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[In Concert (TV series)|In Concert]]'' (aired March 29), their first television appearance. On April 29, the band performed \"Firehouse\" on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. This broadcast included Simmons's first televised interview, a conversation with [[Mike Douglas]] in which Simmons declared himself \"evil incarnate\", eliciting uncomfortable reactions from a confused studio audience. Fellow Jewish-American guest [[Totie Fields]] said it would be humorous if beneath all the make-up Simmons was \"just a [[nice Jewish boy]]\". Simmons responded, \"You should only know\", to which Fields replied, \"I do. You can't hide the [[hook nose|hook]]\", a reference to the [[Jewish nose|stereotypical \"Jewish\" nose]].<ref>{{cite video |date=October 31, 2006 |title=Kissology Volume One: 1974\u20131977 |type=DVD |publisher=[[VH1 Classic]]}}</ref>\n\nDespite the publicity and constant touring, ''Kiss'' initially sold just 75,000 copies. Meanwhile, the group and Casablanca Records were losing money quickly. The band (while touring) stopped in Los Angeles in August 1974 to begin recording their second album, ''[[Hotter than Hell (album)|Hotter Than Hell]],'' which was released on October 22, 1974. The only single, \"[[Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll]]\", failed to chart, and the album stalled at No. 100.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nWith ''Hotter Than Hell'' quickly dropping off the charts, Kiss was pulled from their tour to quickly record a new album. Casablanca head Bogart stepped in to produce the next album, trading in the murky, distorted sound of ''Hotter Than Hell'' for a cleaner and slightly poppier sound. ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]'', released on March 19, 1975, fared slightly better commercially than ''Hotter Than Hell''. It also contained what later became the band's signature song, \"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11054/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Review ''Dressed to Kill''|last=Prato|first=Greg|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=January 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Kiss albums had not proved to be big sellers, the band was quickly gaining a reputation for their live performances. Kiss concerts featured such spectacles as Simmons spitting \"blood\" (an effect made primarily from raw egg whites, strawberry syrup and red food coloring) and \"breathing fire\" (spitting flammable liquid at a torch), Frehley soloing as his guitar burst into flames (light and smoke bombs placed inside the guitar), Criss's elevating drum riser that emitted sparks, Stanley's [[Pete Townshend|Townshend]]-style guitar smashing, and pyrotechnics throughout the show.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 62\u201364.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1975, Casablanca was almost bankrupt, and Kiss was in danger of losing their record contract.

Compiled from May\u2013July concerts in [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Wildwood, NJ]] and released on September 10, 1975, ''[[Alive! (Kiss album)|Alive!]]'' achieved [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] status and spawned Kiss' first top 40 single: a live version of \"Rock and Roll All Nite\". It was the first version of the song with a guitar solo, and this recording has become the best-known version. It is also the basis of most covers, such as the cover by [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] in 1987. In recent years the band admitted that additional audience noise had been added to the album, as well as overdubs on select guitar and vocal spots, not to deceive fans, but to add more \"excitement and realism\" to the record.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 169\u2013172.</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Alive!'' not only brought Kiss the breakthrough they had been seeking, but arguably saved Casablanca, which was close to bankruptcy. Following this success, Kiss partnered with producer [[Bob Ezrin]], who had previously worked with [[Alice Cooper]]. The result was ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' (released March 15, 1976), Kiss's most musically ambitious studio album to date. ''Destroyer'', with its rather intricate production (using an orchestra, choir, and numerous tape effects), was a departure from the raw sound of the first three studio albums. Album art was designed by [[Ken Kelly (artist)|Ken Kelly]], who had drawn [[Tarzan]] and [[Conan the Barbarian]] and also produced album covers for acts such as [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] and [[Manowar]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Mark Voger |title=Criss eager to meet television idol Zacherley |work=[[Asbury Park Press]] |page=6E |date=October 22, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Manowar truck to make its debut in Austria this weekend |work=Austria Today |date=September 8, 2006}}</ref> While the album sold well initially and became the group's second gold album, it quickly dropped down the charts. Only when the ballad \"[[Beth (song)|Beth]]\", the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to the single \"[[Detroit Rock City]]\", began to gain more airplay on FM radio did the album's sales rebound. The single was subsequently reissued with the A and B-sides reversed. \"Beth\" peaked at No. 7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], and its success led to an increase in sales for both the album (which achieved [[RIAA certification|platinum]] status by the end of 1976) and concert tickets.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[File:Kiss in New Haven 1978.jpg|thumb|upright|Simmons and Frehley share a microphone in 1978.]]\nIn October 1976, Kiss appeared on ''[[The Paul Lynde Halloween Special]]'', [[lip-sync]]hing \"[[Detroit Rock City]]\", \"[[Beth (song)|Beth]]\" and \"[[King of the Night Time World]]\". The show, co-produced by Bill Aucoin, helped introduce Kiss to an even wider audience. In addition to the three songs, Kiss was the subject of a brief comedic \"interview\" conducted by [[Paul Lynde]]. This included Lynde noting, when hearing the member's first names, \"Oh, I love a good religious group.\" The group was introduced to Lynde by [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]], reprising her character of the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard Of Oz]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nTwo more highly successful studio albums were released in less than a year: ''[[Rock and Roll Over]]'' (November 11, 1976) and ''[[Love Gun]]'' (June 30, 1977). A second live album, ''[[Alive II]]'', was released on October 14, 1977. All three albums were certified platinum soon after their release.

Some of the products released included a pair of comic books issued by Marvel (the first contained ink mixed with actual blood donated by the group), a [[pinball]] machine, dolls, \"Kiss Your Face Makeup\" kits, [[Halloween]] masks, [[board game]]s, lunchboxes, trading cards and many other pieces of memorabilia. Membership in the [[Kiss Army]], the band's fan club, was in the six figures.

In addition, Kiss' gross income for 1977 was $10.2&nbsp;million.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} The group, along with manager Aucoin, sought to take the band to the next level of popularity. To that end, an ambitious, two-pronged strategy was devised for 1978.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\n\nThe first part involved the simultaneous release of four solo albums from the members of Kiss. Although Kiss has claimed that the solo albums were intended to ease rising tensions within the band, their 1976 record contract did in fact call for four solo records, with each of them counting as half an album toward the group's five-record commitment.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', p. 271.</ref> Each album was a solo effort (none of the group appeared on another's album), and were all released and marketed as Kiss albums (with similar cover art and poster inserts). It was the first time that all current members of a rock band had released solo albums on the same day.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 92.</ref>\n\nFor the band members, it was a chance to showcase their individual musical styles and tastes outside of Kiss, and in some cases to collaborate with contemporary artists. Stanley's and Frehley's albums were most similar to Kiss' hard rock style, while Criss' album featured an [[R&B]] style with multiple ballads. Simmons' was the most diverse of the four, featuring hard rock, ballads, [[The Beatles|Beatles]]-influenced pop and a [[cover version|cover]] of \"[[When You Wish upon a Star]]\" from the Disney film ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''. Simmons' many collaborators included [[Aerosmith]]'s [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]], [[Cheap Trick]]'s [[Rick Nielsen]], [[the Doobie Brothers]]' [[Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Janis Ian]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Katey Sagal]] and his then-girlfriend [[Cher]].\n\nThe solo albums were released on September 18, 1978. Casablanca spent $2.5&nbsp;million on the marketing campaign for the albums, and announced they were shipping five million copies, guaranteeing platinum status.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 94.</ref> Despite the large shipments, none of the albums sold particularly well and were later sold as [[Cut-out (recording industry)|cut-outs]]. Of the four, Frehley's album was the most successful, and spawned the only hit single, a cover of \"[[New York Groove]]\", written by [[Russ Ballard]] and originally performed by [[Hello (band)|Hello]].<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 95.</ref>\n\nThe second part of Kiss' and Aucoin's plan called for the band to appear in a film that would cement their image as larger-than-life rock and roll superheroes. Filming commenced in the spring of 1978. Although the project was proposed to the band as a cross between ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', the final result fell far short of those expectations. The script underwent numerous rewrites, and the band (particularly Criss and Frehley) grew increasingly frustrated with the filmmaking process.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe final product, ''[[Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park]]'', debuted on [[NBC]] on October 28, 1978. It was released theatrically, after many changes, outside the U.S. in 1979 under the title ''Attack of the Phantoms''. The band members were unhappy with the finished film, and would speak about their filmmaking experience in later interviews with a mix of humorous embarrassment and regret. They felt that the film portrayed them more as clowns than superheroes. The artistic failure of the film led to a rift between the band and Aucoin.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 91\u201392.</ref> It has been only sporadically available on home video; currently, a version of the film is available on the compilation DVD ''[[Kissology Volume Two: 1978\u20131991]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===1979\u20131983: Final make-up years===\nKiss' first album of new material in two years, ''[[Dynasty (Kiss album)|Dynasty]]'' (May 22, 1979), continued its platinum streak. The disco-flavored \"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\" became one of the band's biggest hit singles to date, peaking at No. 11. Session drummer [[Anton Fig]] did almost all the percussion on the album while Criss recovered from an automobile accident. The only song to feature Criss' drumming was \"Dirty Livin{{'\"}}, on which he also sang lead.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 346\u2013347.</ref>\n\nBilled as \"The Return of Kiss\", the [[Dynasty Tour]] was expected by Kiss and their management to build on the success of previous tours. Plans were drawn up for a Kiss-themed traveling [[amusement park]] called \"Kiss World\", but were abandoned because of the immense costs involved;<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 102\u2013105.</ref> however, \"The Return of Kiss\" saw a marked decline in attendance.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 98.</ref>\n\nThe crowds on this tour were much younger than previous audiences had been, with many preadolescent children in Kiss make-up with their mothers and fathers (who were sometimes wearing the make-up themselves) in tow at most concerts. Kiss themselves did little to dissuade this new fan base, donning colorful costumes that reinforced a cartoonish image for these younger fans.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 100.</ref>\n\nThe fans were unaware of the dissension within the band. One very public indication of the heightened friction within the group was an infamous October 31, 1979, interview on [[Tom Snyder]]'s late-night ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]''. During the episode, a visibly irritated Simmons and Stanley attempted, unsuccessfully, to contain the [[Alcohol intoxication|inebriated]] Frehley, whose frequent laughter and joking overshadowed the conversation between Snyder and the rest of the band. Criss made references to his large gun collection, to the chagrin of Simmons.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 170\u2013171.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the ''Dynasty'' tour in December 1979, tensions between Criss and the rest of the band were at an all-time high. His drumming skills had noticeably eroded, and he even intentionally slowed down\u2014or stopped playing altogether\u2014during some concerts. The final show of the tour (December 16, 1979) was the last time Criss performed with the group for almost 17 years, although he remained an official member for nearly six more months.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 97\u201398.</ref><ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 150\u2013151.</ref>\n\nSession drummer Anton Fig played all the drums on the next album, ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'', although he was not credited, while Peter Criss appeared on the cover. Showcasing a slick, contemporary pop sound, ''Unmasked'' (released May 20, 1980) had the dubious distinction of being the first Kiss album since ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]'' to not achieve platinum sales. Soon after the album's release, Criss' departure was officially announced.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 109.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 101\u2013102.</ref> Anton Fig, considered a member of Kiss for one day following the departure of Criss, was then fired by Stanley and Simmons, who felt he was not a good fit for the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bnMF7j2nP4|title=KISS Legend Ace Frehley - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction? (Part 2)|website=Youtube.com}}</ref>\n\nThe band auditioned dozens of replacements for Criss in June 1980. One of the many who auditioned was [[Tico Torres]] (who would later be with [[Bon Jovi]]). They finally settled on a little-known drummer-guitarist-pianist-keyboardist-singer from Brooklyn named Paul Charles Caravello (born July 12, 1950) who adopted the stage name [[Eric Carr]]. His first make-up design was modeled on a hawk, though it was rejected as Stanley felt it looked more like a chicken. Carr ultimately settled on a \"Fox\" persona. In his Fox make-up, he was introduced on ABC's ''[[Kids Are People Too!]]'', and debuted with the group on July 25, 1980, at the [[Palladium (club)|Palladium]] concert hall in New York City. This was Kiss's only U.S. show in support of ''Unmasked''. The band's [[Unmasked Tour|1980 tour]] of Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, was one of the biggest in their history, as they played to sold-out crowds and received overwhelmingly positive press coverage.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 113.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 102.</ref>\n\nFor their next album, the band worked again with producer Ezrin, with whom Kiss had found success on ''Destroyer''. Early press reports indicated that the new album would be a return to the hard rock style that had originally brought the band success. However, 1981's ''[[Music from \"The Elder\"]]'' was a [[concept album]] featuring medieval horns, strings, [[harp]]s, and synthesizers.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', p. 460.</ref>\n\nThe album was presented as a soundtrack to a film that was never made, making it difficult to follow the storyline. To make matters worse, having received negative feedback following their record company's preview of the album, Kiss altered the record's track sequence in most countries to emphasize potential singles \"The Oath\" and \"A World Without Heroes\", which all but guaranteed the inability of listeners to understand the already muddled storyline. Once released, fan reaction to ''The Elder'' was harsh; it failed to achieve gold status and peaked at No. 75 on the ''Billboard'' album chart.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 462\u2013463.</ref>\n\nThe band made only two appearances in support of the new album, both in January 1982. One was a performance on the ABC late-night variety program ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'', while the second was a lip-synced performance that was broadcast via satellite during Italy's [[Sanremo Music Festival]].<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 117.</ref> Kiss also performed \"[[I (Kiss song)|I]]\" and \"[[A World Without Heroes]]\" on ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAbsent from the satellite performance was Frehley, who had become increasingly frustrated with Kiss' new musical direction. Upset with the band's decision to record ''Music from \"The Elder\"'', he did not actively participate in the album's creation, providing lead vocals for only one track, \"Dark Light\". He did not appear at a special concert at Studio 54 in New York City, leaving Kiss to perform as a trio. He recorded his guitar parts at his home studio in [[Wilton, Connecticut]], and mailed them to Ezrin. Another source of frustration for Frehley was that with the departure of Criss, and with Carr not being an equal partner in the band, he was often outvoted 2-to-1 on group decisions. In June 1982, Frehley's departure from the band was negotiated, although he did not officially leave until December, and remained a business partner with Simmons and Stanley until 1985.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nSimmons stated in his autobiography ''[[Kiss and Make-Up]]'' that [[Eddie Van Halen]] wanted to fill Frehley's spot. Simmons and Eddie's brother [[Alex Van Halen|Alex]] convinced Eddie to remain with [[Van Halen]].<ref>Simmons, ''Kiss and Make-up'', p. 186.</ref> Eddie was anxious to break up Van Halen because of tensions with lead singer [[David Lee Roth]], who left the band soon thereafter.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', p. 514.</ref><ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 243\u2013244.</ref> Other notable musicians who auditioned for the band include [[Punky Meadows]] of [[Angel (band)|Angel]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Prato|first1=Greg|url=http://www.alternativenation.net/guitarist-turned-kiss-aerosmith-new-york-dolls/|title=The Guitarist Who Turned Down KISS, Aerosmith & New York Dolls|work=alternativenation.net|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref> [[Doug Aldrich]] of [[Whitesnake]] and [[Dio (band)|Dio]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nikas |first1=Sakis |last2=Dolas |first2=Yannis |url=http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=7391&type=1&lang=EN |title=Interviews - Doug Aldrich |work=rockpages.gr |accessdate=April 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426105402/http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=7391&type=1&lang=EN |archivedate=April 26, 2012 |df= }}</ref> [[Richie Sambora]] of [[Bon Jovi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitar.com/articles/richie-sambora-kiss-reject-pop-rock-hero|title=Richie Sambora - Kiss Reject, Pop Rock Hero|work=guitar.com|accessdate=April 25, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521101015/http://www.guitar.com/articles/richie-sambora-kiss-reject-pop-rock-hero|archivedate=May 21, 2011|df=}}</ref> and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ochoa |first=Hugh |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2010/06/24/malmsteen/ |title=Yngwie Malmsteen Interview: Strats, Shreds and Sweeps |work=guitarinternational.com |accessdate=April 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402002803/http://guitarinternational.com/2010/06/24/malmsteen/ |archivedate=April 2, 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSoon after, Kiss made major changes to their business dealings&nbsp;\u2013 chief among them was severing ties with their manager of nine years, Bill Aucoin, and cutting back on their unwieldy organizational tree. Although Frehley had already decided to leave the band, he was pictured on the covers of 1982's ''[[Killers (Kiss album)|Killers]]'' and ''[[Creatures of the Night]]'', although he did not participate in the recording of either album.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 255\u2013256.</ref>\n\n''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' (October 13, 1982) was Kiss' heaviest album to date, and although it fared better than ''[[Music from \"The Elder\"]]'', it peaked at only No. 45 on the charts and was not certified gold until 1994. In Frehley's absence, Kiss utilized a number of guitarists for the recording of the album, including [[Vinnie Vincent]] (born Vincent John Cusano on August 6, 1952).{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nFrehley's last appearance with the band (until the 1996 reunion) was in the music video for the single \"[[I Love It Loud]]\", which was co-written by Vincent. Frehley also appeared on the cover of the original ''Creatures of the Night'' album artwork. When the album was remixed and re-released in 1985 with a non-make-up cover and a slightly different song order, to reflect the band's roster change and abandonment of their make-up and costumes, Vincent was again absent from the album cover, as then-current lead guitarist, [[Bruce Kulick]], appeared instead.<ref name=\"Music Legends\">{{cite web |publisher=Music Legends| url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/bruce-kulick-interview/|title=Bruce Kulick Interview| accessdate=May 8, 2013|date=March 14, 2011|last=Saulnier|first=Jason}}</ref> The liner notes accompanying the remixed LP, however, credited both Frehley and Vincent with lead guitar performances on the ''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' album. Vincent officially replaced Frehley as lead guitarist in December 1982, as the band embarked on its 10th Anniversary Tour.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 493\u2013495.</ref><ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 118\u2013120.</ref>\n\nVincent originally wanted to use his birth name in the band, but this was vetoed by Simmons on the grounds that it sounded \"too ethnic\". Specifically, according to Simmons, \"it sounded like a fruit vendor.\" Simmons went on to note that \"fairly or unfairly, rock and roll is about image\".<ref name=\"Simmons, p. 187\">Simmons, ''Kiss and Make-up'', p. 187.</ref> Vincent then suggested the name \"Mick Fury\", but this was also disallowed.

This incarnation of Kiss was to be the last incarnation of the original make-up era.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nVincent's personality did not mesh well with either Stanley or Simmons, and he was dismissed from Kiss at the end of the ''Creatures'' tour. He was reinstated before recording started for ''[[Lick It Up]]'' because Simmons and Stanley could not find a new lead guitarist on such short notice. Vincent appeared on the cover of ''Lick It Up'' and was credited as the lead guitarist. He received a writing credit for eight of the ten songs on the album; \"Fits Like a Glove\" and \"Dance All Over Your Face\" were written solely by Simmons.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nPersonality issues arose once again, and Vincent was fired following the ''Lick It Up'' tour, due in part to excessive guitar soloing at a 1984 concert in Quebec. He was replaced by [[Mark St. John]] (birth name Mark Norton). Vincent's work on ''Creatures of the Night'' was not officially recognized until the album was remastered in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nVincent was later utilized by Kiss as a songwriter on the 1992 album ''[[Revenge (Kiss album)|Revenge]]'', contributing to the songs \"[[Unholy (song)|Unholy]]\", \"Tough Love\", \"Heart of Chrome\" and \"[[I Just Wanna (Kiss song)|I Just Wanna]]\". Before long, Vincent fell out with Simmons and Stanley for a third time, and they again severed their musical ties.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nPersistent rumors circulated for years among Kiss fans regarding the true reason for Vincent's dismissals from Kiss, with at least one band member refusing to comment except to say that legally it was not up for discussion. Simmons stated in an interview several years later that Vincent's firing was for \"unethical behavior\", but he did not elaborate:\n\n{{quote|I named Vincent Cusano, 'Vinnie Vincent'. That's the only gift he's allowed. It's interesting that Vinnie hasn't changed his name back to Vinnie Cusano. Vinnie, for the record, was fired for unethical behavior, not because of lack of talent.

The band officially appeared in public without make-up for the first time on a September 18, 1983, appearance on MTV, which coincided with the release of ''Lick It Up''.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 289.</ref> The tour to promote the new album and the unmasked band members began in Lisbon, Portugal, on October 11, 1983, at Pavilh\u00e3o Dram\u00e1tico de Cascais, their first concert without make-up since early 1973. ''Lick It Up'' became Kiss' first gold record in three years, but the tour was even more sparsely attended than the previous one. Vincent did not get along with Simmons and Stanley, and he left the band at the conclusion of the tour in March 1984. Vincent's replacement was Mark St. John, a session player and guitar tutor.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 294.</ref>\n\nWith St. John, Kiss released the album ''[[Animalize]]'' on September 13, 1984. ''Animalize'' followed the success of ''Lick It Up'', and due in part to consistent MTV play for the \"[[Heaven's on Fire]]\" video, ''Animalize'' was the band's best-selling record in America during the decade, with over two million albums sold. With the success of the album and subsequent tour, Kiss had recaptured some of their earlier glory (though not to the level of their 1970s heyday). St. John, however, came down with [[reactive arthritis]] during tour rehearsals, and only performed at a handful of shows. St. John was relieved of his duties from Kiss in December 1984 and was replaced by Kulick (born December 12, 1953, in Brooklyn). Kulick was Kiss' fourth lead guitarist in less than three years, but he stayed with the band for 12 years.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 139\u2013140.</ref> Kulick was one of the band's longest-serving members, with the longest continuous tenure of anyone other than Simmons and Stanley, but he never wore the band's iconic makeup.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[File:BruceKulickGFR2002.jpg|175px|thumb|[[Bruce Kulick]] (pictured here in 2002) was the lead guitarist for Kiss from 1984 to 1996.]]\nOne of the first concerts Kulick played was at Detroit, Michigan's [[Cobo Hall]]. It was filmed for the MTV special ''[[Animalize Live]]''. This was later released as the band's first home video, (''[[Animalize Live Uncensored]]'').{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe lineup of Stanley, Simmons, Carr and Kulick turned out to be the most stable since the original, and for the rest of the 1980s, Kiss released a series of platinum albums: 1985's ''[[Asylum (Kiss album)|Asylum]]'', 1987's ''[[Crazy Nights]]'' and the 1988 greatest hits compilation ''[[Smashes, Thrashes & Hits]]''. ''Crazy Nights'', in particular, was one of Kiss' most successful albums overseas. The single \"[[Crazy Crazy Nights]]\" reached No. 4 on the singles chart in the United Kingdom, their highest-charting single in that country.<ref name=\"charts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kissfaq.com/charts/scharts.html|title=Singles Chart Action|work=The Kiss FAQ|accessdate=July 30, 2006}}</ref>\n\nKiss ended the decade with the October 1989 release ''[[Hot in the Shade]]''. Although the album failed to achieve platinum status, it spawned the hit ballad \"[[Forever (Kiss song)|Forever]]\", co-written by [[Michael Bolton]]. Peaking at No. 8 in the US, it was the group's highest-charting single since \"Beth\" and was the band's second Top 10 single.<ref name=\"charts\"/>\n\nDuring this time, Kiss struggled with their identity and fan base. Simmons, arguably the driving force in Kiss during the 1970s, became less involved with the group in the 1980s as he pursued outside interests, most notably a film career. Stanley took a more prominent role as a result.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 311\u2013312.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 360\u2013363.</ref>\n\nIn February 1991, the band decided to once again enlist Ezrin to produce their next album. Before recording could begin in earnest, however, tragedy struck. In March 1991, it was discovered that Carr had a [[tumor]] on his heart. It was successfully removed the following month, but more tumors were soon discovered in his lungs. Carr received [[chemotherapy]] and was pronounced cancer-free in July. However, in September he suffered the first of two [[cerebral hemorrhage]]s. He died on November 24, 1991, at the age of 41.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 107.</ref><ref name=\"carrobit\">{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1DE123DF935A15752C1A967958260|title=Eric Carr, 41, Is Dead; Rock Band's Drummer|date=November 26, 1991|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 16, 2006}}</ref> Coincidentally, [[Queen (band)|Queen]] frontman [[Freddie Mercury]] died the same day.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDespite the tragic loss of a longtime member, Kiss continued, introducing veteran drummer [[Eric Singer]] (born Eric Doyle Mensinger on May 12, 1958, in Cleveland, Ohio). Singer had played with Paul Stanley previously, as part of Stanley's backing band during a 1989 solo tour. Singer also played with artists such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Gary Moore]], [[Lita Ford]], [[Badlands (American band)|Badlands]] and Alice Cooper.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nKiss released ''[[Revenge (Kiss album)|Revenge]]'' on May 19, 1992. It featured a leaner, harder-edged sound, as indicated by the first single, \"[[Unholy (song)|Unholy]]\". In a surprise move, Kiss enlisted Vincent to help with songwriting duties. The album debuted in the Top 10 and went gold. Kiss embarked on a brief club tour of the U.S. in the spring of 1992, before beginning an American tour in September 1992. The tour was documented on the album ''[[Alive III]]'', released on May 14, 1993. Four days later, Kiss were inducted into [[Guitar Center#Hollywood.27s RockWalk|Hollywood's RockWalk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockwalk.com/inductees |title=Guitar Center's Hollywood Rockwalk |publisher=Rockwalk.com |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, Kiss nostalgia started to pick up steam. June 1994 saw the release of ''[[Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved]]'', a compilation album featuring popular artists of the era putting their own spin on Kiss songs. The result was an eclectic mix, featuring [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s funky version of \"Deuce\" (with [[Stevie Wonder]] on harmonica), a [[ska punk]] version of \"Detroit Rock City\" by the [[Mighty Mighty Bosstones]] and [[Garth Brooks]]' straightforward take on \"Hard Luck Woman\", with Kiss themselves as his backing band.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn 1995, the group released the book ''[[Bibliography of Kiss#Kisstory|Kisstory]]'', a 440-page, {{convert|9|lb|kg}}, detailed chronicle of the group's history to that point. That same year, the band embarked on a unique and well-received Worldwide Kiss Convention Tour. The conventions were all-day events, featuring displays of vintage Kiss stage outfits, instruments and memorabilia; performances by Kiss cover bands; and dealers selling Kiss merchandise from every stage of the band's career. Kiss appeared live at the conventions, conducted question and answer sessions, signed autographs, and performed a two-hour acoustic set composed mostly of spontaneous fan requests. On the first U.S. date (June 17, 1995), Criss appeared onstage with Kiss to sing \"Hard Luck Woman\" and \"Nothin' to Lose\". It was the first time Criss had performed publicly with the band in nearly 16 years.<ref name=\"Sharp, pp. 108\">Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 108\u2013110.</ref><ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 217.</ref>\n\n===1995\u20132001: Reunion===\nOn August 9, 1995, Kiss joined the long line of musicians to perform on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. The band contacted Criss and Frehley and invited them to participate in the event. Both joined Kiss on stage for several songs at the end of the set: \"Beth\", \"2000 Man\", \"Nothin' to Lose\" and \"Rock and Roll All Nite\".<ref name=\"Sharp, pp. 108\"/> The ''Unplugged'' appearance set off months of speculation that a possible reunion of the original Kiss lineup was in the works. In the weeks following the ''Unplugged'' concert, however, the band (with Kulick and Singer), returned to the studio for the first time in three years to record a follow-up to ''Revenge''. ''[[Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions]]'' was completed in February 1996, but its release was delayed for almost two years.

Tours got larger, carrying more personnel and equipment, including sets, costumes, sound and lighting gear, and pyrotechnics, all requiring more trucking and the total cost increasing by millions of dollars. Kiss also innovated with a significant expansion of concert merchandising, selling non-musical [[Kiss merchandising|Kiss-branded goods]] to concertgoers. The sales of merchandise helped pay for the concert expenses and bring a profit to the band as well as give them more of a presence without relying solely on radio. Other bands copied Kiss by selling their own branded goods at concerts, a practice which became more of a necessity in the 1980s with increasing costs of touring.<ref name=Konow2009/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/02/music-wont-pay-the-band/ |title=Music Won't Feed The Band \u2013 But Merch Might |last=Van Buskirk |first=Eliot |date=February 23, 2010 |work=Wired |accessdate=May 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\n{{details|List of Kiss members}}\n\n'''Current'''\n*[[Paul Stanley]] \u2013 lead and backing vocals, rhythm guitar (1973\u2013present)\n*[[Gene Simmons]] \u2013 lead and backing vocals, bass (1973\u2013present)\n*[[Eric Singer]] \u2013 drums, backing and lead vocals (1991\u20131996, 2001\u22122002, 2004\u2013present)\n*[[Tommy Thayer]] \u2013 lead guitar, backing and lead vocals (2002\u2013present)\n\n'''Former'''\n*[[Ace Frehley]] \u2013 lead guitar, backing and lead vocals (1973\u20131982, 1996\u20132002)\n*[[Peter Criss]] \u2013 drums, backing and lead vocals (1973\u20131980, 1996\u20132001, 2002\u20132004)\n*[[Eric Carr]] \u2013 drums, backing and lead vocals (1980\u20131991; his death)\n*[[Vinnie Vincent]] \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals (1982\u20131984)\n*[[Mark St. John]] \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals (1984; died 2007)\n*[[Bruce Kulick]] \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals (1984\u20131996)\n\n==Makeup designs==\nThe band are famous for their iconic makeup designs, each of which represents a different character or persona. The current lineup consists of the original 4 designs: the \"Starchild\", the \"Demon\", the \"Spaceman\" and the \"Catman\". The band formerly included a practice of giving any new members a new persona, such as \"The Fox\" for Carr and \"The Ankh Warrior\" for Vincent; this practice was ended after Singer and Thayer took up Frehley's \"Spaceman\" and Criss's \"Catman\" personas. When asked on the matter, Simmons stated \"Why wouldn\u2019t we use the classic makeup? We own it\". Criss relinquished his rights to his makeup when he left the band in 2004, which he later regretted, saying \"I\u2019m pissed at myself that my makeup slipped through my hands\"; while Frehley claims he licensed his design to the band and would get it back, a notion which Stanley has called \"a fantasy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/gene-simmons-on-kiss-makeup-controversy-why-wouldnt-we-use-it-164306/|title=Gene Simmons Talks Kiss Makeup Controversy|first1=Kory|last1=Grow|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1973\u201374, Stanley occasionally used an alternative makeup design called the \"Bandit\" for select photo-shoots and live shows after [[Neil Bogart]], head of Casablanca Records, suggested to him that he use a design that was symmetrical with the rest of the band's faces. During this time, he was also still using the Starchild makeup\u2014 sometimes even using both designs at the same photo-shoots. In 1974, he stopped using the Bandit design permanently. Criss used a drastically different variation of his Catman makeup on the cover of their debut album, dubbed the \"Pantomime Cat\", after Criss allowed the makeup artist at the shoot to use their own ideas instead of following the usual design. Carr was originally going to be the \"Hawk\", a design which Simmons recalled in his autobiography looked like [[Big Bird]] from [[Sesame Street]]. One photo of Carr wearing this proposed design exists today and one of a mannequin Stanley set up wearing the proposed makeup and outfit. Unlike the Bandit and Pantomime Cat, this alternative design was never used in any official capacity. The Hawk design was also considered for Vincent and Singer.<ref>\"[http://metaltalk.net/columns_eighteen/chris_dale_undiscovered_kisstory_alternative_makeup.php/metaltalk.net/columns_eighteen/chris_dale_undiscovered_kisstory_alternative_makeup.php Undiscovered Kisstory: Alternative Makeup Designs] at Metaltalk.net</ref>\n\nSt. John and Kulick were members of Kiss only during the period where the band members did not perform wearing makeup. Kulick stated had he ever worn makeup in the band, he would have liked to have been the \"Dog\": \"I figure that since there's already a cat in the band, I should probably be the dog. I'd have a big circle around one eye and I'd look like Petey from the [[Little Rascals]]. I've actually seen one or two fan renditions of what that might look like, so yeah, I'd be the dog.\" The four original makeup designs have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, with ownership and licensing rights held by Simmons and Stanley.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:KISS starchild face.svg|The Starchild<br/>[[Paul Stanley]]\nImage:KISS devil face.svg|The Demon<br/>[[Gene Simmons]]\nImage:KISS space ace face.svg|The Spaceman<br/>[[Ace Frehley]] <small>(\"Space Ace\")</small><br/>[[Tommy Thayer]]\nImage:KISS cat face.svg|The Catman<br/>[[Peter Criss]]<br/>[[Eric Singer]]\nImage:KISS fox face.svg|The Fox<br/>[[Eric Carr]]\nImage:KISS ankh warrior face.svg|The Ankh Warrior<br/>[[Vinnie Vincent]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Kiss}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Kiss discography}}\n;Studio albums\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*''[[Kiss (Kiss album)|Kiss]]'' (1974)\n*''[[Hotter than Hell (album)|Hotter than Hell]]'' (1974)\n*''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]'' (1975)\n*''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' (1976)\n*''[[Rock and Roll Over]]'' (1976)\n*''[[Love Gun]]'' (1977)\n*''[[Paul Stanley (album)|Paul Stanley]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Gene Simmons (album)|Gene Simmons]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Ace Frehley (album)|Ace Frehley]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Peter Criss (album)|Peter Criss]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Dynasty (Kiss album)|Dynasty]]'' (1979)\n*''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Music from \"The Elder\"]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Lick It Up]]'' (1983)\n*''[[Animalize]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Asylum (Kiss album)|Asylum]]'' (1985)\n*''[[Crazy Nights]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Hot in the Shade]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Revenge (Kiss album)|Revenge]]'' (1992)\n*''[[Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions]]'' (1997)\n*''[[Psycho Circus]]'' (1998)\n*''[[Sonic Boom (Kiss album)|Sonic Boom]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Monster (Kiss album)|Monster]]'' (2012)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Tours==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[The Early Days of Kiss|Club Tour]] (1973)\n* [[Kiss Tour]] (1974)\n* [[Hotter than Hell Tour]] (1974\u20131975)\n* [[Dressed to Kill Tour (Kiss)|Dressed to Kill Tour]] (1975)\n* [[Alive!

Well known for its members' face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid-to-late 1970s with their [[shock rock|elaborate]] live performances, which featured [[fire breathing]], blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits, and [[pyrotechnics]]. The band has gone through several lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons being the only members to feature in every lineup. The original and best-known lineup consisted of Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Simmons (vocals and bass), Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Criss (drums and vocals).\n\nWith their make-up and costumes, they took on the personae of comic book-style characters: the Starchild (Stanley), the Demon (Simmons), the Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and the Catman (Criss). Due to creative differences, both Criss and Frehley had departed the group by 1982.\n\nIn 1983, Kiss began performing without makeup and costumes, thus marking the beginning of the band's \"unmasked\" era that would last for over a decade. They accordingly experienced a commercial resurgence, with the [[RIAA certification#List of certifications|platinum certified]] album ''[[Lick It Up]]'' successfully introducing them to a new generation of fans, and their music videos received regular airplay on [[MTV]]. [[Eric Carr]], who had replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of [[heart cancer]] and was replaced by [[Eric Singer]]. In response to a wave of Kiss [[nostalgia]] in the mid-1990s, the original lineup re-united in 1996, which also saw the return of their makeup and stage costumes. The resulting [[Alive/Worldwide Tour]] was highly successful, grossing $143.7&nbsp;million, making it their most successful tour to date. Criss and Frehley have both since left the band again and have been replaced by Singer and [[Tommy Thayer]]. The band has continued with their original stage makeup, with Singer and Thayer using the original Catman and Spaceman makeup, respectively. In September 2018, Kiss announced that, after 45 years of recording and performing, they would be embarking on their final tour, [[End of the Road World Tour|The End of the Road World Tour]], in 2019, with the final show confirmed for July 17, 2021 in New York City where the band formed back in 1973, with additional shows added.<ref name=\"farewell tour 2019\">{{cite news|title=It's Official: KISS To Launch Farewell Tour, 'End Of The Road', In 2019|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/its-official-kiss-to-launch-farewell-tour-end-of-the-road-in-january/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=September 20, 2018|date=September 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/gene-simmons-says-kisss-end-of-the-road-tour-could-last-more-than-three-years/|title=GENE SIMMONS Says KISS's 'End Of The Road' Tour Could Last More Than Three Years|publisher=Blabbermouth|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=July 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kiss-to-launch-three-year-world-tour-in-january-2019-says-gene-simmons/|title=KISS To Launch Three Year Tour In January 2019, Says GENE SIMMONS|publisher=Blabbermouth|date=June 4, 2018|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-final-concert/|title=Kiss Reveal Date and Location of Final 'End of the Road' Concert|publisher=Ultimate Classic Rock|date=November 2, 2019|accessdate=November 2, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-2020-tour-dates/|title=Kiss Reveal 75 New 2020 \u2018End of the Road\u2019 Tour Dates|last=Kielty|first=Martin|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\nKiss is [[List of best-selling music artists|one of the best-selling bands of all time]], having sold more than 75&nbsp;million records worldwide, including 21<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|title=Gold & Platinum|website=RIAA|accessdate=October 8, 2019}}</ref> million [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified albums.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/sep/22/rooted-in-enjoyment-20170922/|title=Rooted In Enjoyment|first=Becca|last=Martin-Brown|work=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]|date=September 22, 2017|accessdate=May 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=RIAA Top Selling Artists |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=top_tallies&ttt=TAA#search_section |accessdate=June 13, 2017}}</ref> Kiss also holds the title as America's #1 Gold record award-winning group of all time, having earned 30 Gold albums.

They recorded one album, which was shelved by [[Epic Records]], and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 14.</ref><ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 68\u201371.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nAfter abandoning the name Wicked Lester late in 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] version of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed by [[Peter Criss]], a veteran drummer from the New York City scene who had previously played in the bands Lips and [[Chelsea (American band)|Chelsea]]. Simmons and Stanley met Criss in a nightclub where he was playing drums. After hearing Criss sing, they thought Criss should be in the new band they were forming. Criss then auditioned for, and later joined their new band. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than what Wicked Lester played. They also began experimenting with their image, by wearing makeup and various outfits.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 33, 57\u201358.</ref> In November 1972, the trio played a showcase for Epic Records [[A&R]] director Don Ellis, in an effort to secure a record deal. Although the performance went well, Ellis disliked the group's image and music.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist [[Ace Frehley]]. Frehley impressed the group with his first audition, although he showed up wearing two different colored sneakers, one red and one orange. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the classic lineup was solidified as the band to be named Kiss.<ref name=\"acebio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kayosproductions.com/artists.php?id=57|title=Artist bio: Ace Frehley|publisher=Kayos Productions|accessdate=January 6, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080049/http://www.kayosproductions.com/artists.php?id=57|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}</ref>\n[[File:Kiss Logo.svg|thumb|upright|The Kiss logo]]\nStanley came up with the name while he, Simmons and Criss were driving around New York City.

However, Simmons and Stanley, both Jewish, have denied any intentional likeness to Nazi symbolism in the logo. Since 1979, most of the band's album covers and merchandise in Germany have used an alternate logo, in which the letters \"SS\" look like the letters \"ZZ\" backwards. This logo is also used in [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Hungary]] and [[Israel]] to avoid controversy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe band's name has repeatedly been the subject of rumors pertaining to alleged hidden meanings. Among these rumors are claims that the name is an acronym for \"Knights in Satan's Service\", \"Kinder SS\", or \"Kids in Satan's Service\". Simmons has denied all of these claims.<ref name=\"simmons\">Simmons, Gene (2001). ''Kiss and Make-up''.

For the first three gigs, January 30 to February 1, they wore little to no makeup; the iconic makeup designs associated with Kiss made their debut during the March 9\u201310 shows at The Daisy in [[Amityville, New York]]. On March 13 of that year, the band recorded a five-song demo tape with producer [[Eddie Kramer]]. Former TV director [[Bill Aucoin]], who had seen the group at a handful of showcase concerts in the summer of 1973, offered to become the band's manager in mid-October. Kiss agreed, with the condition that Aucoin sign the band to a record label within two weeks. On November 1, 1973, Kiss became the first act signed to former teen pop singer and [[Buddah Records]] executive [[Neil Bogart]]'s new label, [[Casablanca Records]].<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 145\u2013146.</ref>\n\nThe band entered Bell Sound Studios in New York City on October 10, 1973, to begin recording their first album. On December 31, the band had their official industry premiere at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music|Academy of Music]] in New York City, opening for [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]. It was at this concert that Simmons accidentally set his hair (which was coated in hairspray) ablaze for the first of many times while performing his fire-breathing routine.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 27.</ref>\n\nKiss' first tour started on February 5, 1974, in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], at the [[Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium]], as an opening act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kissonline.com/history|title=Kiss Chronology|work=kissonline.com|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}</ref> The band's [[Kiss (Kiss album)|self-titled debut album]] was released on February 8. Casablanca and Kiss promoted the album heavily throughout the spring and summer of 1974. On February 19, the band performed \"[[Nothin' to Lose (Kiss song)|Nothin' to Lose]]\", \"[[Firehouse (Kiss song)|Firehouse]]\" and \"[[Black Diamond (Kiss song)|Black Diamond]]\" on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[In Concert (TV series)|In Concert]]'' (aired March 29), their first television appearance. On April 29, the band performed \"Firehouse\" on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. This broadcast included Simmons's first televised interview, a conversation with [[Mike Douglas]] in which Simmons declared himself \"evil incarnate\", eliciting uncomfortable reactions from a confused studio audience. Fellow Jewish-American guest [[Totie Fields]] said it would be humorous if beneath all the make-up Simmons was \"just a [[nice Jewish boy]]\". Simmons responded, \"You should only know\", to which Fields replied, \"I do. You can't hide the [[hook nose|hook]]\", a reference to the [[Jewish nose|stereotypical \"Jewish\" nose]].<ref>{{cite video |date=October 31, 2006 |title=Kissology Volume One: 1974\u20131977 |type=DVD |publisher=[[VH1 Classic]]}}</ref>\n\nDespite the publicity and constant touring, ''Kiss'' initially sold just 75,000 copies. Meanwhile, the group and Casablanca Records were losing money quickly. The band (while touring) stopped in Los Angeles in August 1974 to begin recording their second album, ''[[Hotter than Hell (album)|Hotter Than Hell]],'' which was released on October 22, 1974. The only single, \"[[Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll]]\", failed to chart, and the album stalled at No. 100.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nWith ''Hotter Than Hell'' quickly dropping off the charts, Kiss was pulled from their tour to quickly record a new album. Casablanca head Bogart stepped in to produce the next album, trading in the murky, distorted sound of ''Hotter Than Hell'' for a cleaner and slightly poppier sound. ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]'', released on March 19, 1975, fared slightly better commercially than ''Hotter Than Hell''. It also contained what later became the band's signature song, \"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11054/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Review ''Dressed to Kill''|last=Prato|first=Greg|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=January 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Kiss albums had not proved to be big sellers, the band was quickly gaining a reputation for their live performances. Kiss concerts featured such spectacles as Simmons spitting \"blood\" (an effect made primarily from raw egg whites, strawberry syrup and red food coloring) and \"breathing fire\" (spitting flammable liquid at a torch), Frehley soloing as his guitar burst into flames (light and smoke bombs placed inside the guitar), Criss's elevating drum riser that emitted sparks, Stanley's [[Pete Townshend|Townshend]]-style guitar smashing, and pyrotechnics throughout the show.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 62\u201364.</ref>\n\nBy mid-1975, Casablanca was almost bankrupt, and Kiss was in danger of losing their record contract. Both parties desperately needed a commercial breakthrough if they were to survive.<ref>{{cite web|last=Young |first=Charles |title=Kiss: The Pagan Beasties of Teenage Rock |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kiss-the-pagan-beasties-of-teenage-rock-20120427?print=true |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ADLdpiPk?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kiss-the-pagan-beasties-of-teenage-rock-20120427?print=true |archivedate=August 26, 2012 |date=April 7, 1977 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> That breakthrough came in an unlikely form: a \"double live\" album.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11053|pure_url=yes}}|title=Review ''Alive!''|last=Prato|first=Greg|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=January 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===1975\u20131978: Rise to prominence===\n[[Image:Kiss - Paul Stanley - Destroyer Tour.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Kiss in [[Winnipeg]] on the [[Alive!

Compiled from May\u2013July concerts in [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Wildwood, NJ]] and released on September 10, 1975, ''[[Alive! (Kiss album)|Alive!]]'' achieved [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] status and spawned Kiss' first top 40 single: a live version of \"Rock and Roll All Nite\". It was the first version of the song with a guitar solo, and this recording has become the best-known version. It is also the basis of most covers, such as the cover by [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] in 1987. In recent years the band admitted that additional audience noise had been added to the album, as well as overdubs on select guitar and vocal spots, not to deceive fans, but to add more \"excitement and realism\" to the record.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 169\u2013172.</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Alive!'' not only brought Kiss the breakthrough they had been seeking, but arguably saved Casablanca, which was close to bankruptcy. Following this success, Kiss partnered with producer [[Bob Ezrin]], who had previously worked with [[Alice Cooper]]. The result was ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' (released March 15, 1976), Kiss's most musically ambitious studio album to date. ''Destroyer'', with its rather intricate production (using an orchestra, choir, and numerous tape effects), was a departure from the raw sound of the first three studio albums. Album art was designed by [[Ken Kelly (artist)|Ken Kelly]], who had drawn [[Tarzan]] and [[Conan the Barbarian]] and also produced album covers for acts such as [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] and [[Manowar]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Mark Voger |title=Criss eager to meet television idol Zacherley |work=[[Asbury Park Press]] |page=6E |date=October 22, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Manowar truck to make its debut in Austria this weekend |work=Austria Today |date=September 8, 2006}}</ref> While the album sold well initially and became the group's second gold album, it quickly dropped down the charts. Only when the ballad \"[[Beth (song)|Beth]]\", the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to the single \"[[Detroit Rock City]]\", began to gain more airplay on FM radio did the album's sales rebound. The single was subsequently reissued with the A and B-sides reversed. \"Beth\" peaked at No. 7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], and its success led to an increase in sales for both the album (which achieved [[RIAA certification|platinum]] status by the end of 1976) and concert tickets.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[File:Kiss in New Haven 1978.jpg|thumb|upright|Simmons and Frehley share a microphone in 1978.]]\nIn October 1976, Kiss appeared on ''[[The Paul Lynde Halloween Special]]'', [[lip-sync]]hing \"[[Detroit Rock City]]\", \"[[Beth (song)|Beth]]\" and \"[[King of the Night Time World]]\". The show, co-produced by Bill Aucoin, helped introduce Kiss to an even wider audience. In addition to the three songs, Kiss was the subject of a brief comedic \"interview\" conducted by [[Paul Lynde]].

A second live album, ''[[Alive II]]'', was released on October 14, 1977. All three albums were certified platinum soon after their release.

At Bogart's request, this version of the song featured a [[disco]] influence.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 272\u2013273.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, [[Kiss merchandising|Kiss merchandise]] became a substantial source of income for the group. Some of the products released included a pair of comic books issued by Marvel (the first contained ink mixed with actual blood donated by the group), a [[pinball]] machine, dolls, \"Kiss Your Face Makeup\" kits, [[Halloween]] masks, [[board game]]s, lunchboxes, trading cards and many other pieces of memorabilia. Membership in the [[Kiss Army]], the band's fan club, was in the six figures. Between 1977 and 1979, worldwide merchandise sales (in-store and on tour) reached an estimated $100&nbsp;million.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 162.</ref>\n\n===1978: Solo and film projects===\n[[File:Kiss - Ace Frehley (1977).jpg|thumb|upright|Frehley demonstrates the pyrotechnics that helped make Kiss a live sensation.]]\n[[File:Kiss - Peter Criss (1977).jpg|thumb|upright|Criss performing in 1977]]\nKiss were at their commercial peak by 1978.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} ''Alive II'' was the band's fourth platinum album in just under two years, and the ensuing tour had the highest average attendance (13,550){{citation needed|date=April 2014}} in the group's history. In addition, Kiss' gross income for 1977 was $10.2&nbsp;million.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} The group, along with manager Aucoin, sought to take the band to the next level of popularity. To that end, an ambitious, two-pronged strategy was devised for 1978.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\n\nThe first part involved the simultaneous release of four solo albums from the members of Kiss. Although Kiss has claimed that the solo albums were intended to ease rising tensions within the band, their 1976 record contract did in fact call for four solo records, with each of them counting as half an album toward the group's five-record commitment.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', p. 271.</ref> Each album was a solo effort (none of the group appeared on another's album), and were all released and marketed as Kiss albums (with similar cover art and poster inserts). It was the first time that all current members of a rock band had released solo albums on the same day.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 92.</ref>\n\nFor the band members, it was a chance to showcase their individual musical styles and tastes outside of Kiss, and in some cases to collaborate with contemporary artists. Stanley's and Frehley's albums were most similar to Kiss' hard rock style, while Criss' album featured an [[R&B]] style with multiple ballads. Simmons' was the most diverse of the four, featuring hard rock, ballads, [[The Beatles|Beatles]]-influenced pop and a [[cover version|cover]] of \"[[When You Wish upon a Star]]\" from the Disney film ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''. Simmons' many collaborators included [[Aerosmith]]'s [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]], [[Cheap Trick]]'s [[Rick Nielsen]], [[the Doobie Brothers]]' [[Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Janis Ian]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Katey Sagal]] and his then-girlfriend [[Cher]].\n\nThe solo albums were released on September 18, 1978. Casablanca spent $2.5&nbsp;million on the marketing campaign for the albums, and announced they were shipping five million copies, guaranteeing platinum status.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 94.</ref> Despite the large shipments, none of the albums sold particularly well and were later sold as [[Cut-out (recording industry)|cut-outs]]. Of the four, Frehley's album was the most successful, and spawned the only hit single, a cover of \"[[New York Groove]]\", written by [[Russ Ballard]] and originally performed by [[Hello (band)|Hello]].<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 95.</ref>\n\nThe second part of Kiss' and Aucoin's plan called for the band to appear in a film that would cement their image as larger-than-life rock and roll superheroes. Filming commenced in the spring of 1978. Although the project was proposed to the band as a cross between ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', the final result fell far short of those expectations. The script underwent numerous rewrites, and the band (particularly Criss and Frehley) grew increasingly frustrated with the filmmaking process.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe final product, ''[[Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park]]'', debuted on [[NBC]] on October 28, 1978. It was released theatrically, after many changes, outside the U.S. in 1979 under the title ''Attack of the Phantoms''. The band members were unhappy with the finished film, and would speak about their filmmaking experience in later interviews with a mix of humorous embarrassment and regret. They felt that the film portrayed them more as clowns than superheroes. The artistic failure of the film led to a rift between the band and Aucoin.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 91\u201392.</ref> It has been only sporadically available on home video; currently, a version of the film is available on the compilation DVD ''[[Kissology Volume Two: 1978\u20131991]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===1979\u20131983: Final make-up years===\nKiss' first album of new material in two years, ''[[Dynasty (Kiss album)|Dynasty]]'' (May 22, 1979), continued its platinum streak. The disco-flavored \"[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]\" became one of the band's biggest hit singles to date, peaking at No. 11. Session drummer [[Anton Fig]] did almost all the percussion on the album while Criss recovered from an automobile accident. The only song to feature Criss' drumming was \"Dirty Livin{{'\"}}, on which he also sang lead.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 346\u2013347.</ref>\n\nBilled as \"The Return of Kiss\", the [[Dynasty Tour]] was expected by Kiss and their management to build on the success of previous tours. Plans were drawn up for a Kiss-themed traveling [[amusement park]] called \"Kiss World\", but were abandoned because of the immense costs involved;<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 102\u2013105.</ref> however, \"The Return of Kiss\" saw a marked decline in attendance.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 98.</ref>\n\nThe crowds on this tour were much younger than previous audiences had been, with many preadolescent children in Kiss make-up with their mothers and fathers (who were sometimes wearing the make-up themselves) in tow at most concerts. Kiss themselves did little to dissuade this new fan base, donning colorful costumes that reinforced a cartoonish image for these younger fans.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 100.</ref>\n\nThe fans were unaware of the dissension within the band. One very public indication of the heightened friction within the group was an infamous October 31, 1979, interview on [[Tom Snyder]]'s late-night ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]''. During the episode, a visibly irritated Simmons and Stanley attempted, unsuccessfully, to contain the [[Alcohol intoxication|inebriated]] Frehley, whose frequent laughter and joking overshadowed the conversation between Snyder and the rest of the band. Criss made references to his large gun collection, to the chagrin of Simmons.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 170\u2013171.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the ''Dynasty'' tour in December 1979, tensions between Criss and the rest of the band were at an all-time high. His drumming skills had noticeably eroded, and he even intentionally slowed down\u2014or stopped playing altogether\u2014during some concerts. The final show of the tour (December 16, 1979) was the last time Criss performed with the group for almost 17 years, although he remained an official member for nearly six more months.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 97\u201398.</ref><ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 150\u2013151.</ref>\n\nSession drummer Anton Fig played all the drums on the next album, ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'', although he was not credited, while Peter Criss appeared on the cover. Showcasing a slick, contemporary pop sound, ''Unmasked'' (released May 20, 1980) had the dubious distinction of being the first Kiss album since ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]'' to not achieve platinum sales. Soon after the album's release, Criss' departure was officially announced.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 109.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 101\u2013102.</ref> Anton Fig, considered a member of Kiss for one day following the departure of Criss, was then fired by Stanley and Simmons, who felt he was not a good fit for the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bnMF7j2nP4|title=KISS Legend Ace Frehley - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction? (Part 2)|website=Youtube.com}}</ref>\n\nThe band auditioned dozens of replacements for Criss in June 1980. One of the many who auditioned was [[Tico Torres]] (who would later be with [[Bon Jovi]]). They finally settled on a little-known drummer-guitarist-pianist-keyboardist-singer from Brooklyn named Paul Charles Caravello (born July 12, 1950) who adopted the stage name [[Eric Carr]]. His first make-up design was modeled on a hawk, though it was rejected as Stanley felt it looked more like a chicken. Carr ultimately settled on a \"Fox\" persona. In his Fox make-up, he was introduced on ABC's ''[[Kids Are People Too!]]'', and debuted with the group on July 25, 1980, at the [[Palladium (club)|Palladium]] concert hall in New York City. This was Kiss's only U.S. show in support of ''Unmasked''. The band's [[Unmasked Tour|1980 tour]] of Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, was one of the biggest in their history, as they played to sold-out crowds and received overwhelmingly positive press coverage.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 113.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 102.</ref>\n\nFor their next album, the band worked again with producer Ezrin, with whom Kiss had found success on ''Destroyer''. Early press reports indicated that the new album would be a return to the hard rock style that had originally brought the band success. However, 1981's ''[[Music from \"The Elder\"]]'' was a [[concept album]] featuring medieval horns, strings, [[harp]]s, and synthesizers.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', p. 460.</ref>\n\nThe album was presented as a soundtrack to a film that was never made, making it difficult to follow the storyline. To make matters worse, having received negative feedback following their record company's preview of the album, Kiss altered the record's track sequence in most countries to emphasize potential singles \"The Oath\" and \"A World Without Heroes\", which all but guaranteed the inability of listeners to understand the already muddled storyline. Once released, fan reaction to ''The Elder'' was harsh; it failed to achieve gold status and peaked at No. 75 on the ''Billboard'' album chart.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 462\u2013463.</ref>\n\nThe band made only two appearances in support of the new album, both in January 1982. One was a performance on the ABC late-night variety program ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'', while the second was a lip-synced performance that was broadcast via satellite during Italy's [[Sanremo Music Festival]].<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 117.</ref> Kiss also performed \"[[I (Kiss song)|I]]\" and \"[[A World Without Heroes]]\" on ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAbsent from the satellite performance was Frehley, who had become increasingly frustrated with Kiss' new musical direction. Upset with the band's decision to record ''Music from \"The Elder\"'', he did not actively participate in the album's creation, providing lead vocals for only one track, \"Dark Light\". He did not appear at a special concert at Studio 54 in New York City, leaving Kiss to perform as a trio. He recorded his guitar parts at his home studio in [[Wilton, Connecticut]], and mailed them to Ezrin. Another source of frustration for Frehley was that with the departure of Criss, and with Carr not being an equal partner in the band, he was often outvoted 2-to-1 on group decisions. In June 1982, Frehley's departure from the band was negotiated, although he did not officially leave until December, and remained a business partner with Simmons and Stanley until 1985.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nSimmons stated in his autobiography ''[[Kiss and Make-Up]]'' that [[Eddie Van Halen]] wanted to fill Frehley's spot.

Although Frehley had already decided to leave the band, he was pictured on the covers of 1982's ''[[Killers (Kiss album)|Killers]]'' and ''[[Creatures of the Night]]'', although he did not participate in the recording of either album.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 255\u2013256.</ref>\n\n''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' (October 13, 1982) was Kiss' heaviest album to date, and although it fared better than ''[[Music from \"The Elder\"]]'', it peaked at only No. 45 on the charts and was not certified gold until 1994. In Frehley's absence, Kiss utilized a number of guitarists for the recording of the album, including [[Vinnie Vincent]] (born Vincent John Cusano on August 6, 1952).{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nFrehley's last appearance with the band (until the 1996 reunion) was in the music video for the single \"[[I Love It Loud]]\", which was co-written by Vincent. Frehley also appeared on the cover of the original ''Creatures of the Night'' album artwork. When the album was remixed and re-released in 1985 with a non-make-up cover and a slightly different song order, to reflect the band's roster change and abandonment of their make-up and costumes, Vincent was again absent from the album cover, as then-current lead guitarist, [[Bruce Kulick]], appeared instead.<ref name=\"Music Legends\">{{cite web |publisher=Music Legends| url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/bruce-kulick-interview/|title=Bruce Kulick Interview| accessdate=May 8, 2013|date=March 14, 2011|last=Saulnier|first=Jason}}</ref> The liner notes accompanying the remixed LP, however, credited both Frehley and Vincent with lead guitar performances on the ''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' album.

He was reinstated before recording started for ''[[Lick It Up]]'' because Simmons and Stanley could not find a new lead guitarist on such short notice. Vincent appeared on the cover of ''Lick It Up'' and was credited as the lead guitarist. He received a writing credit for eight of the ten songs on the album; \"Fits Like a Glove\" and \"Dance All Over Your Face\" were written solely by Simmons.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nPersonality issues arose once again, and Vincent was fired following the ''Lick It Up'' tour, due in part to excessive guitar soloing at a 1984 concert in Quebec. He was replaced by [[Mark St. John]] (birth name Mark Norton). Vincent's work on ''Creatures of the Night'' was not officially recognized until the album was remastered in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nVincent was later utilized by Kiss as a songwriter on the 1992 album ''[[Revenge (Kiss album)|Revenge]]'', contributing to the songs \"[[Unholy (song)|Unholy]]\", \"Tough Love\", \"Heart of Chrome\" and \"[[I Just Wanna (Kiss song)|I Just Wanna]]\". Before long, Vincent fell out with Simmons and Stanley for a third time, and they again severed their musical ties.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nPersistent rumors circulated for years among Kiss fans regarding the true reason for Vincent's dismissals from Kiss, with at least one band member refusing to comment except to say that legally it was not up for discussion. Simmons stated in an interview several years later that Vincent's firing was for \"unethical behavior\", but he did not elaborate:\n\n{{quote|I named Vincent Cusano, 'Vinnie Vincent'.

The band officially appeared in public without make-up for the first time on a September 18, 1983, appearance on MTV, which coincided with the release of ''Lick It Up''.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 289.</ref> The tour to promote the new album and the unmasked band members began in Lisbon, Portugal, on October 11, 1983, at Pavilh\u00e3o Dram\u00e1tico de Cascais, their first concert without make-up since early 1973. ''Lick It Up'' became Kiss' first gold record in three years, but the tour was even more sparsely attended than the previous one. Vincent did not get along with Simmons and Stanley, and he left the band at the conclusion of the tour in March 1984. Vincent's replacement was Mark St. John, a session player and guitar tutor.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 294.</ref>\n\nWith St. John, Kiss released the album ''[[Animalize]]'' on September 13, 1984. ''Animalize'' followed the success of ''Lick It Up'', and due in part to consistent MTV play for the \"[[Heaven's on Fire]]\" video, ''Animalize'' was the band's best-selling record in America during the decade, with over two million albums sold. With the success of the album and subsequent tour, Kiss had recaptured some of their earlier glory (though not to the level of their 1970s heyday). St. John, however, came down with [[reactive arthritis]] during tour rehearsals, and only performed at a handful of shows. St. John was relieved of his duties from Kiss in December 1984 and was replaced by Kulick (born December 12, 1953, in Brooklyn). Kulick was Kiss' fourth lead guitarist in less than three years, but he stayed with the band for 12 years.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 139\u2013140.</ref> Kulick was one of the band's longest-serving members, with the longest continuous tenure of anyone other than Simmons and Stanley, but he never wore the band's iconic makeup.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[File:BruceKulickGFR2002.jpg|175px|thumb|[[Bruce Kulick]] (pictured here in 2002) was the lead guitarist for Kiss from 1984 to 1996.]]\nOne of the first concerts Kulick played was at Detroit, Michigan's [[Cobo Hall]]. It was filmed for the MTV special ''[[Animalize Live]]''. This was later released as the band's first home video, (''[[Animalize Live Uncensored]]'').{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe lineup of Stanley, Simmons, Carr and Kulick turned out to be the most stable since the original, and for the rest of the 1980s, Kiss released a series of platinum albums: 1985's ''[[Asylum (Kiss album)|Asylum]]'', 1987's ''[[Crazy Nights]]'' and the 1988 greatest hits compilation ''[[Smashes, Thrashes & Hits]]''. ''Crazy Nights'', in particular, was one of Kiss' most successful albums overseas. The single \"[[Crazy Crazy Nights]]\" reached No. 4 on the singles chart in the United Kingdom, their highest-charting single in that country.<ref name=\"charts\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kissfaq.com/charts/scharts.html|title=Singles Chart Action|work=The Kiss FAQ|accessdate=July 30, 2006}}</ref>\n\nKiss ended the decade with the October 1989 release ''[[Hot in the Shade]]''. Although the album failed to achieve platinum status, it spawned the hit ballad \"[[Forever (Kiss song)|Forever]]\", co-written by [[Michael Bolton]]. Peaking at No. 8 in the US, it was the group's highest-charting single since \"Beth\" and was the band's second Top 10 single.<ref name=\"charts\"/>\n\nDuring this time, Kiss struggled with their identity and fan base. Simmons, arguably the driving force in Kiss during the 1970s, became less involved with the group in the 1980s as he pursued outside interests, most notably a film career. Stanley took a more prominent role as a result.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 311\u2013312.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 360\u2013363.</ref>\n\nIn February 1991, the band decided to once again enlist Ezrin to produce their next album. Before recording could begin in earnest, however, tragedy struck. In March 1991, it was discovered that Carr had a [[tumor]] on his heart.

The album debuted in the Top 10 and went gold. Kiss embarked on a brief club tour of the U.S. in the spring of 1992, before beginning an American tour in September 1992. The tour was documented on the album ''[[Alive III]]'', released on May 14, 1993.

June 1994 saw the release of ''[[Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved]]'', a compilation album featuring popular artists of the era putting their own spin on Kiss songs. The result was an eclectic mix, featuring [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s funky version of \"Deuce\" (with [[Stevie Wonder]] on harmonica), a [[ska punk]] version of \"Detroit Rock City\" by the [[Mighty Mighty Bosstones]] and [[Garth Brooks]]' straightforward take on \"Hard Luck Woman\", with Kiss themselves as his backing band.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn 1995, the group released the book ''[[Bibliography of Kiss#Kisstory|Kisstory]]'', a 440-page, {{convert|9|lb|kg}}, detailed chronicle of the group's history to that point. That same year, the band embarked on a unique and well-received Worldwide Kiss Convention Tour. The conventions were all-day events, featuring displays of vintage Kiss stage outfits, instruments and memorabilia; performances by Kiss cover bands; and dealers selling Kiss merchandise from every stage of the band's career. Kiss appeared live at the conventions, conducted question and answer sessions, signed autographs, and performed a two-hour acoustic set composed mostly of spontaneous fan requests. On the first U.S. date (June 17, 1995), Criss appeared onstage with Kiss to sing \"Hard Luck Woman\" and \"Nothin' to Lose\". It was the first time Criss had performed publicly with the band in nearly 16 years.<ref name=\"Sharp, pp. 108\">Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 108\u2013110.</ref><ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 217.</ref>\n\n===1995\u20132001: Reunion===\nOn August 9, 1995, Kiss joined the long line of musicians to perform on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''.

Both joined Kiss on stage for several songs at the end of the set: \"Beth\", \"2000 Man\", \"Nothin' to Lose\" and \"Rock and Roll All Nite\".<ref name=\"Sharp, pp. 108\"/> The ''Unplugged'' appearance set off months of speculation that a possible reunion of the original Kiss lineup was in the works. In the weeks following the ''Unplugged'' concert, however, the band (with Kulick and Singer), returned to the studio for the first time in three years to record a follow-up to ''Revenge''. ''[[Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions]]'' was completed in February 1996, but its release was delayed for almost two years.

Tours got larger, carrying more personnel and equipment, including sets, costumes, sound and lighting gear, and pyrotechnics, all requiring more trucking and the total cost increasing by millions of dollars. Kiss also innovated with a significant expansion of concert merchandising, selling non-musical [[Kiss merchandising|Kiss-branded goods]] to concertgoers. The sales of merchandise helped pay for the concert expenses and bring a profit to the band as well as give them more of a presence without relying solely on radio. Other bands copied Kiss by selling their own branded goods at concerts, a practice which became more of a necessity in the 1980s with increasing costs of touring.<ref name=Konow2009/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/02/music-wont-pay-the-band/ |title=Music Won't Feed The Band \u2013 But Merch Might |last=Van Buskirk |first=Eliot |date=February 23, 2010 |work=Wired |accessdate=May 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\n{{details|List of Kiss members}}\n\n'''Current'''\n*[[Paul Stanley]] \u2013 lead and backing vocals, rhythm guitar (1973\u2013present)\n*[[Gene Simmons]] \u2013 lead and backing vocals, bass (1973\u2013present)\n*[[Eric Singer]] \u2013 drums, backing and lead vocals (1991\u20131996, 2001\u22122002, 2004\u2013present)\n*[[Tommy Thayer]] \u2013 lead guitar, backing and lead vocals (2002\u2013present)\n\n'''Former'''\n*[[Ace Frehley]] \u2013 lead guitar, backing and lead vocals (1973\u20131982, 1996\u20132002)\n*[[Peter Criss]] \u2013 drums, backing and lead vocals (1973\u20131980, 1996\u20132001, 2002\u20132004)\n*[[Eric Carr]] \u2013 drums, backing and lead vocals (1980\u20131991; his death)\n*[[Vinnie Vincent]] \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals (1982\u20131984)\n*[[Mark St. John]] \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals (1984; died 2007)\n*[[Bruce Kulick]] \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals (1984\u20131996)\n\n==Makeup designs==\nThe band are famous for their iconic makeup designs, each of which represents a different character or persona. The current lineup consists of the original 4 designs: the \"Starchild\", the \"Demon\", the \"Spaceman\" and the \"Catman\". The band formerly included a practice of giving any new members a new persona, such as \"The Fox\" for Carr and \"The Ankh Warrior\" for Vincent; this practice was ended after Singer and Thayer took up Frehley's \"Spaceman\" and Criss's \"Catman\" personas. When asked on the matter, Simmons stated \"Why wouldn\u2019t we use the classic makeup? We own it\". Criss relinquished his rights to his makeup when he left the band in 2004, which he later regretted, saying \"I\u2019m pissed at myself that my makeup slipped through my hands\"; while Frehley claims he licensed his design to the band and would get it back, a notion which Stanley has called \"a fantasy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/gene-simmons-on-kiss-makeup-controversy-why-wouldnt-we-use-it-164306/|title=Gene Simmons Talks Kiss Makeup Controversy|first1=Kory|last1=Grow|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1973\u201374, Stanley occasionally used an alternative makeup design called the \"Bandit\" for select photo-shoots and live shows after [[Neil Bogart]], head of Casablanca Records, suggested to him that he use a design that was symmetrical with the rest of the band's faces. During this time, he was also still using the Starchild makeup\u2014 sometimes even using both designs at the same photo-shoots. In 1974, he stopped using the Bandit design permanently. Criss used a drastically different variation of his Catman makeup on the cover of their debut album, dubbed the \"Pantomime Cat\", after Criss allowed the makeup artist at the shoot to use their own ideas instead of following the usual design. Carr was originally going to be the \"Hawk\", a design which Simmons recalled in his autobiography looked like [[Big Bird]] from [[Sesame Street]]. One photo of Carr wearing this proposed design exists today and one of a mannequin Stanley set up wearing the proposed makeup and outfit. Unlike the Bandit and Pantomime Cat, this alternative design was never used in any official capacity. The Hawk design was also considered for Vincent and Singer.<ref>\"[http://metaltalk.net/columns_eighteen/chris_dale_undiscovered_kisstory_alternative_makeup.php/metaltalk.net/columns_eighteen/chris_dale_undiscovered_kisstory_alternative_makeup.php Undiscovered Kisstory: Alternative Makeup Designs] at Metaltalk.net</ref>\n\nSt. John and Kulick were members of Kiss only during the period where the band members did not perform wearing makeup. Kulick stated had he ever worn makeup in the band, he would have liked to have been the \"Dog\": \"I figure that since there's already a cat in the band, I should probably be the dog. I'd have a big circle around one eye and I'd look like Petey from the [[Little Rascals]]. I've actually seen one or two fan renditions of what that might look like, so yeah, I'd be the dog.\" The four original makeup designs have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, with ownership and licensing rights held by Simmons and Stanley.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:KISS starchild face.svg|The Starchild<br/>[[Paul Stanley]]\nImage:KISS devil face.svg|The Demon<br/>[[Gene Simmons]]\nImage:KISS space ace face.svg|The Spaceman<br/>[[Ace Frehley]] <small>(\"Space Ace\")</small><br/>[[Tommy Thayer]]\nImage:KISS cat face.svg|The Catman<br/>[[Peter Criss]]<br/>[[Eric Singer]]\nImage:KISS fox face.svg|The Fox<br/>[[Eric Carr]]\nImage:KISS ankh warrior face.svg|The Ankh Warrior<br/>[[Vinnie Vincent]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Kiss}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Kiss discography}}\n;Studio albums\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*''[[Kiss (Kiss album)|Kiss]]'' (1974)\n*''[[Hotter than Hell (album)|Hotter than Hell]]'' (1974)\n*''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]'' (1975)\n*''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' (1976)\n*''[[Rock and Roll Over]]'' (1976)\n*''[[Love Gun]]'' (1977)\n*''[[Paul Stanley (album)|Paul Stanley]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Gene Simmons (album)|Gene Simmons]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Ace Frehley (album)|Ace Frehley]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Peter Criss (album)|Peter Criss]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Dynasty (Kiss album)|Dynasty]]'' (1979)\n*''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Music from \"The Elder\"]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Lick It Up]]'' (1983)\n*''[[Animalize]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Asylum (Kiss album)|Asylum]]'' (1985)\n*''[[Crazy Nights]]'' (1987)\n*''[[Hot in the Shade]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Revenge (Kiss album)|Revenge]]'' (1992)\n*''[[Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions]]'' (1997)\n*''[[Psycho Circus]]'' (1998)\n*''[[Sonic Boom (Kiss album)|Sonic Boom]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Monster (Kiss album)|Monster]]'' (2012)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Tours==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[The Early Days of Kiss|Club Tour]] (1973)\n* [[Kiss Tour]] (1974)\n* [[Hotter than Hell Tour]] (1974\u20131975)\n* [[Dressed to Kill Tour (Kiss)|Dressed to Kill Tour]] (1975)\n* [[Alive!

Its electorate is the graduates of the university, which has a number of constituent universities. It previously elected members to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] (1918\u201321), to the [[Parliament of Southern Ireland|House of Commons of Southern Ireland]] (1921) and to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (1918\u20131936).\n\n==Representation==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In 1918 the electorate included all registered male graduates over 21 (or over 19 if in armed services) and female graduates over 30. There were 3,819 voters registered for the 1918 general election. Most, if not all, of those electors would have been [[plural voting|plural voters]] also entitled to vote in a territorial constituency. The [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]] took place on 14 December and the results were declared on 28 December, except for the university constituencies. NUI voted between 18\u201322 December and the result was declared on 23 December. [[Eoin MacNeill]] was elected (and also for [[Londonderry City (UK Parliament constituency)|Londonderry City]]) standing for [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and therefore did not take his seat in Westminster, instead serving as a member of the first D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\n\n===House of Commons of Southern Ireland===\nThe [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] established a devolved home rule legislature, within the United Kingdom, for twenty-six Irish counties which were designated [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]. NUI was given four seats in the [[Parliament of Southern Ireland|House of Commons of Southern Ireland]]. At the [[1921 Irish elections|1921 Southern Ireland House of Commons election]], all 128 seats were elected unopposed. Of these, 124 were [[History of Sinn F\u00e9in|Sinn F\u00e9in]] members, who formed the TDs of the [[Second D\u00e1il]]. This included the four representatives of the NUI.\n\nThe Parliament was dissolved as part of the arrangements under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1922.\n\n===D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann===\n{{Infobox constituency\n| name                = National University of Ireland\n| type                = [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]<br>[[D\u00e1il constituencies|Parliamentary]]\n| year                = [[1922 Irish general election|1922]]\n| abolished           = [[1937 Irish general election|1937]]\n| map4                =\n| map_entity          = Ireland\n| map_size            = 200px\n| seats               = 4 (1922\u20131923)<br>3 (1923\u20131937)\n}}\nIn the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]], [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] contested the election on the basis that they would not take seats in the United Kingdom Parliament but would establish a revolutionary assembly in Dublin.\n\nThe University was, in Irish republican theory, entitled to return one [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (known in English as a Deputy) in 1918 to serve in the [[Irish Republic]]'s [[First D\u00e1il]]. This revolutionary body assembled on 21 January 1919. In republican theory every MP elected in Ireland was a member of the [[First D\u00e1il]]. In practice only Sinn F\u00e9in members participated, including the Deputy for the University.\n\nIn May 1921, [[1921 Irish elections|elections were held]] to the parliaments established under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. Sinn F\u00e9in had decided to use the polls for the House of Commons of Northern Ireland and the House of Commons of Southern Ireland together as an election for the Irish Republic's [[Second D\u00e1il]]. At the last meeting of the First D\u00e1il on 10 May 1921, it passed a motion, the first three parts of which expressed this constitutional position.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1921-05-10/26/|title=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann debate - Tuesday, 10 May 1921 - PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT. - ELECTIONS.|website=Houses of the Oireachtas|access-date=22 June 2019}}</ref>\n# That the parliamentary elections which are to take place during the present month be regarded as elections to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\n# That all deputies duly returned at these elections be regarded as members of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and allowed to take their seats on subscribing to the proposed [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]].\n# That the present D\u00e1il dissolve automatically as soon as the new body has been summoned by the President and called to order.\n\nNo voting occurred in [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]] as all the seats were filled by unopposed returns. Except for [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] all constituencies outside [[Northern Ireland]] elected Sinn F\u00e9in TDs. The [[Second D\u00e1il]] first met on 16 August 1921, thereby dissolving the First D\u00e1il. The [[Third D\u00e1il]] was also elected under the constituencies established by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. On 6 December 1922, this became the house of representatives of the new [[Irish Free State]]. \n\nFrom the [[Electoral Act 1923]] the [[Irish Free State]] defined its own D\u00e1il constituencies. National University of Ireland was reduced to three seats. This Act abolished plural voting for University constituencies and enfranchised women on the same terms as men. Qualified voters could register for a University or a territorial constituency but not for both. The qualifications for an elector to be registered as a University voter were set out in Section 1(2)(c) of the 1923 Act. They were to be registered at \"the University constituency comprising a university in which he or she has received a degree other than an honorary degree\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1923/act/12/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1|title=Electoral Act 1923, Section 1 - D\u00e1il Franchise|date=17 April 1923|access-date=22 June 2019|website=Irish Statute Book}}</ref>\n\nThe Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Act 1936 repealed provisions of the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] providing for University representation in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, with effect from the next dissolution of the Oireachtas which took place on 14 June 1937.

In 1918 the electorate included all registered male graduates over 21 (or over 19 if in armed services) and female graduates over 30. There were 3,819 voters registered for the 1918 general election. Most, if not all, of those electors would have been [[plural voting|plural voters]] also entitled to vote in a territorial constituency. The [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]] took place on 14 December and the results were declared on 28 December, except for the university constituencies. NUI voted between 18\u201322 December and the result was declared on 23 December. [[Eoin MacNeill]] was elected (and also for [[Londonderry City (UK Parliament constituency)|Londonderry City]]) standing for [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and therefore did not take his seat in Westminster, instead serving as a member of the first D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\n\n===House of Commons of Southern Ireland===\nThe [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] established a devolved home rule legislature, within the United Kingdom, for twenty-six Irish counties which were designated [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]. NUI was given four seats in the [[Parliament of Southern Ireland|House of Commons of Southern Ireland]]. At the [[1921 Irish elections|1921 Southern Ireland House of Commons election]], all 128 seats were elected unopposed. Of these, 124 were [[History of Sinn F\u00e9in|Sinn F\u00e9in]] members, who formed the TDs of the [[Second D\u00e1il]]. This included the four representatives of the NUI.\n\nThe Parliament was dissolved as part of the arrangements under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1922.\n\n===D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann===\n{{Infobox constituency\n| name                = National University of Ireland\n| type                = [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]<br>[[D\u00e1il constituencies|Parliamentary]]\n| year                = [[1922 Irish general election|1922]]\n| abolished           = [[1937 Irish general election|1937]]\n| map4                =\n| map_entity          = Ireland\n| map_size            = 200px\n| seats               = 4 (1922\u20131923)<br>3 (1923\u20131937)\n}}\nIn the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]], [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] contested the election on the basis that they would not take seats in the United Kingdom Parliament but would establish a revolutionary assembly in Dublin.\n\nThe University was, in Irish republican theory, entitled to return one [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (known in English as a Deputy) in 1918 to serve in the [[Irish Republic]]'s [[First D\u00e1il]]. This revolutionary body assembled on 21 January 1919. In republican theory every MP elected in Ireland was a member of the [[First D\u00e1il]]. In practice only Sinn F\u00e9in members participated, including the Deputy for the University.\n\nIn May 1921, [[1921 Irish elections|elections were held]] to the parliaments established under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. Sinn F\u00e9in had decided to use the polls for the House of Commons of Northern Ireland and the House of Commons of Southern Ireland together as an election for the Irish Republic's [[Second D\u00e1il]]. At the last meeting of the First D\u00e1il on 10 May 1921, it passed a motion, the first three parts of which expressed this constitutional position.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1921-05-10/26/|title=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann debate - Tuesday, 10 May 1921 - PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT. - ELECTIONS.|website=Houses of the Oireachtas|access-date=22 June 2019}}</ref>\n# That the parliamentary elections which are to take place during the present month be regarded as elections to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\n# That all deputies duly returned at these elections be regarded as members of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and allowed to take their seats on subscribing to the proposed [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]].\n# That the present D\u00e1il dissolve automatically as soon as the new body has been summoned by the President and called to order.\n\nNo voting occurred in [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]] as all the seats were filled by unopposed returns. Except for [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] all constituencies outside [[Northern Ireland]] elected Sinn F\u00e9in TDs. The [[Second D\u00e1il]] first met on 16 August 1921, thereby dissolving the First D\u00e1il. The [[Third D\u00e1il]] was also elected under the constituencies established by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. On 6 December 1922, this became the house of representatives of the new [[Irish Free State]]. \n\nFrom the [[Electoral Act 1923]] the [[Irish Free State]] defined its own D\u00e1il constituencies. National University of Ireland was reduced to three seats. This Act abolished plural voting for University constituencies and enfranchised women on the same terms as men. Qualified voters could register for a University or a territorial constituency but not for both. The qualifications for an elector to be registered as a University voter were set out in Section 1(2)(c) of the 1923 Act. They were to be registered at \"the University constituency comprising a university in which he or she has received a degree other than an honorary degree\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1923/act/12/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1|title=Electoral Act 1923, Section 1 - D\u00e1il Franchise|date=17 April 1923|access-date=22 June 2019|website=Irish Statute Book}}</ref>\n\nThe Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Act 1936 repealed provisions of the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] providing for University representation in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, with effect from the next dissolution of the Oireachtas which took place on 14 June 1937.

No legislation followed since to make any such change.\n\nPolitical party labels do not appear on Seanad election ballot papers.\n\n{{Irish Sen table begin\n |constituency = National University of Ireland\n |maxSens      = 3\n |start        = 1938\n |end          = present\n <!-- the following unnamed parameters are used to make a collapsible key to parties -->\n |Fianna F\u00e1il\n |Fine Gael\n |Labour Party (Ireland)\n |Independent politician\n}}\n{{Irish Sen table Seanad\n |seannum   = 2\n}}\n{{Irish Sen table Sen with party link\n |name      = [[Henry Barniville]]\n |elections = 9\n |party     = Independent politician\n}}\n{{Irish Sen table Sen with party link\n |name      = [[Helena Concannon]]\n |elections = 6\n |party     = Fianna F\u00e1il\n}}\n{{Irish Sen table Sen with party link\n |name      = [[Michael Tierney (politician)|Michael Tierney]]\n |elections = 3\n |party     = Independent politician\n}}\n{{Irish Sen table Seanad\n |seannum   = 3\n}}\n{{Irish Sen table Seanad\n |seannum   = 4\n}}\n{{Irish Sen table Seanad\n |seannum   = 5\n}}\n{{Irish Sen table Sen with party link\n |name      = [[Michael J.

The lower 53 miles (86&nbsp;km) from [[Grand Central Terminal]] to [[Southeast (Metro-North station)|Southeast]], in [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]], is [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] with a [[third rail]] and has at least two tracks. The section north of Southeast, sometimes called the '''Wassaic Branch''', is a non-electrified single-track line served by [[diesel locomotive]]s. The diesel trains run as a shuttle on the northern end of the line, except rush-hour express trains to and from Grand Central.  [[Starting Saturday, March 28, 2020, until further notice, there is no weekend service on The Wassaic Branch]] http://www.mta.com\n\nWith 38 stations, the Harlem Line has the most of any Metro-North main line. Its northern [[Terminal station|terminal]], [[Wassaic (Metro-North station)|Wassaic]], is the northernmost station in the system. It is the only Metro-North line used exclusively by that carrier (no use by [[Amtrak]], though [[CSX]] services freight customers as far north as [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]]) and the only one that uses the entirety of existing track. Metro-North has assigned it the [[color code]] blue, used as trim on station signs and [[spot color]] on printed [[Public transport timetable|timetables]]. The blue color-coding appears to have started with timetables issued by predecessor [[New York Central]] for the then-Harlem Division as far back as 1965.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iridetheharlemline.com/2012/09/21/the-harlem-line-and-the-color-blue/|title=The Harlem Line, and the color blue|last=Moser|first=Emily|date=September 21, 2012|website=I Ride The Harlem Line...|access-date=June 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile the line has traditionally served to bring commuters from [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] to jobs in the city, since the 2000s it has begun to see more \"[[reverse commute|reverse commuting]]\" from the Bronx into Westchester and points north. The northern reaches of the line are also close enough to [[Western Massachusetts]] that residents in parts of that region are also able to commute to jobs in New York City.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|1}}<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n==Line description==\n[[File:Railway map around New York City.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Railway diagram of intercity services around New York City, showing Penn Station and [[Grand Central Terminal]]]]\nThe Harlem Line hews closely to roads along [[river]]-based transportation corridors dating back to even pre-rail times. It follows three major [[parkway]]s closely from the Bronx northwards through Westchester: the [[Bronx River Parkway]] (and a short portion that becomes the [[Taconic State Parkway]]), the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] and [[Interstate 684]]. In the last section it also begins to run close to [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]], the long north-south two-lane state highway that parallels the eastern border of the state. In Westchester, it serves some of that county's most affluent communities as it slowly trends eastward.\n\n===Manhattan and the Bronx===\nThe Harlem Line begins underground at [[Grand Central Terminal]], on the [[Park Avenue main line]]. The train tracks leave underground north of 97th Street and run on an elevated [[viaduct]] starting at 102nd Street in Manhattan. After stopping at [[Harlem\u2013125th Street (Metro-North station)|Harlem\u2013125th Street]], the Harlem Line crosses the Harlem River at 135th Street in [[Manhattan]], entering [[the Bronx]] via the [[Park Avenue Bridge (New York City)|Park Avenue Bridge]]. The train tracks go into [[Cut (earthmoving)|open-cut]] north of 144th Street.\n\nIn the Bronx, the Harlem Line cuts through the neighborhoods of the southwest Bronx, with two stations: [[Melrose (Metro-North station)|Melrose]], at 162nd Street (it then runs under the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]) and [[Tremont (Metro-North station)|Tremont]], at 177th Street. [[Fordham (Metro-North station)|Fordham]] station is next, at Fordham Road (190th Street). The tracks rise to ground level after the Fordham station. The Harlem Line then parallels the western edge of [[Fordham University]] until the [[Botanical Garden (Metro-North station)|Botanical Garden]] station at Bedford Park Boulevard (200th Street).\n\nThe Harlem Line then cuts northeast to join the Bronx River Parkway, which lies to the east of the tracks. The [[Williams Bridge (Metro-North station)|Williams Bridge]] station is next, at Gun Hill Road (210th Street). After the Williams Bridge station, [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] begins to the west of the tracks, with [[Webster Avenue]] in between the cemetery and tracks. The [[Woodlawn (Metro-North station)|Woodlawn]] station is at 233rd Street, and it is north of here that the [[New Haven Line]] diverges to head east towards the [[Northeast Corridor]].\n\nThe Harlem Line then goes under a bridge for the parkway, and it remains to the west of the tracks until [[Scarsdale (Metro-North station)|Scarsdale]] station. The [[Wakefield (Metro-North station)|Wakefield]] station at 241st Street concludes the Bronx portion of the Harlem Line.\n\n===Westchester County===\nThe [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] portion of the Harlem Line begins at Bronx River Road in southeastern [[Yonkers]]. After the [[Mount Vernon West (Metro-North station)|Mount Vernon West]] station, the Harlem Line runs along the on-ramp to the [[Cross County Parkway]] eastbound, right before Fleetwood station. After the [[Bronxville (Metro-North station)|Bronxville]] station, the Harlem Line parallels the [[Bronx River Parkway]] all the way up to [[White Plains (Metro-North station)|White Plains]].\n\nFrom White Plains, the railroad winds its way through the city and passing through the yards at [[North White Plains (Metro-North station)|North White Plains]], which was the northern boundary of third-rail electrification until 1984. The stretch north of North White Plains is unique because it is the only third-rail electrified stretch of Metro-North's network that has [[grade crossing]]s, a byproduct of its existence pre-electrification. [[Katonah (Metro-North station)|Katonah]] and [[Brewster (Metro-North station)|Brewster]] stations are located right next to [[grade crossings]].\n\nAfter North White Plains, the next station is [[Valhalla (Metro-North station)|Valhalla]] adjacent to the Taconic State Parkway. The double-track railroad then curves to follow the [[Saw Mill River]] Valley and the eponymous parkway. Rail and road briefly separate at [[Mount Kisco (Metro-North station)|Mount Kisco]], but then remain close by at the last stop along the Saw Mill, [[Bedford Hills (Metro-North station)|Bedford Hills]] (although the parkway cannot be seen from the station).\n\nPast Katonah, the railroad runs between the [[Croton River]] and I-684. [[Golden's Bridge (Metro-North station)|Golden's Bridge]] and [[Purdy's (Metro-North station)|Purdy's]] are both located very close to the interstate, although only the former can be seen from it. North of the latter, the tracks follow the river to [[Croton Falls (Metro-North station)|Croton Falls]], and pick up Route 22 for the first time.\n\n===Putnam County===\nAfter Croton Falls station, the Harlem Line runs along [[East Branch Reservoir]] and crosses into Putnam County and its rural landscape. Above Brewster station, the railroad passes through the yards at Putnam Junction to [[Southeast (Metro-North station)|Southeast]] station, which was formerly known as Brewster North. This is the northern boundary of [[third rail]] electrification.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|I-2}} \n\nNorth of Southeast, the line operates with a single track and uses diesel locomotives. This section is also known as the Wassaic Branch. Prior to the 2010s, the branch was not signalized, and manual block system rules were used to direct train movements;<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|I-2}} however, [[positive train control]] was installed in the late 2010s.<ref>{{cite web | last=Kazmi | first=Aleeza | title=Positive Train Control Testing Begins On LIRR, Metro-North | website=WSHU | date=October 16, 2018 | url=https://www.wshu.org/post/positive-train-control-testing-begins-lirr-metro-north | access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref> The track finally follows its own course, away from any road or river, past the former Dykemans and abandoned [[Towners (NYCRR station)|Towners]] stations up to [[Patterson (Metro-North station)|Patterson]] and into Dutchess County.\n\n===Dutchess County===\nShortly before reaching [[Pawling (Metro-North station)|Pawling]], the line enters the Harlem Valley (which takes its name from the railroad) and begins to parallel Route 22, although not as closely as it did the roads further south. A few miles north of Pawling, the [[Appalachian Trail]] crossing has [[Appalachian Trail (Metro-North station)|its own stop]] to allow [[Thru-hiking|thru-hikers]] to take a break in the city and day hikers to visit the nearby [[Pawling Nature Preserve]].\n\nThe next two stops, [[Harlem Valley\u2013Wingdale (Metro-North station)|Harlem Valley\u2013Wingdale]] and [[Dover Plains (Metro-North station)|Dover Plains]], are roughly eight miles (13&nbsp;km) apart, the longest distance between any two stops on the Harlem Line. From 1972 to 2000, Dover Plains was the last stop on the line, but then tracks remaining from the NYCRR era that had not yet been torn up were renovated and the line was extended to [[Tenmile River (Metro-North station)|Tenmile River]] and its new northern terminus, [[Wassaic (Metro-North station)|Wassaic]]. The total travel time between Grand Central and Wassaic is 2 hours on a peak through train.\n\nA small [[rail yard|yard]] where diesel trains await their routes just past the station marks the end of the line.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|New York and Harlem Railroad}}\n\n=== Origin as a streetcar line ===\n[[File:1847_Lower_Manhattan_map.jpg|thumb|An 1847 map of [[Lower Manhattan]]; the only railroad in Manhattan at that time was the New York and Harlem Railroad]]\nThe Harlem Line in its current form originated from the New York and Harlem Railroad (NY&H), which was the first streetcar company in the [[United States]].

In 1836 amendment to its charter granted it the right to enter Manhattan along a route that they \"may deem most eligible\"\u2013direct competition to the NY&H. The NY&A had periods of inactivity, in part due to the [[Panic of 1837|financial panic of 1837]]. Surveys were completed in some places, and ground was proken in various areas. [[Gouverneur Morris Jr.|Gouverneur Morris]], a Vice President and Director of the NY&A, reached an agreement with the Harlem.

Initially, the work was to be completed by the end of 1983, but due to a strike, its completion was delayed to 1984. Initially, service was provided with a mixture of new and old electric cars, but these were replaced by the new [[M1/M3 (railcar)|M3A]]s. Work on the project was completed during off-peak hours to allow for service on the line to be maintained. Thirteen of the stations received new high-level center island platforms.

The lower 53 miles (86&nbsp;km) from [[Grand Central Terminal]] to [[Southeast (Metro-North station)|Southeast]], in [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]], is [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] with a [[third rail]] and has at least two tracks. The section north of Southeast, sometimes called the '''Wassaic Branch''', is a non-electrified single-track line served by [[diesel locomotive]]s. The diesel trains run as a shuttle on the northern end of the line, except rush-hour express trains to and from Grand Central.  [[Starting Saturday, March 28, 2020, until further notice, there is no weekend service on The Wassaic Branch]]|<ref>{{Cite web|url=http: //www.mta.com\n\nWith 38 stations, the Harlem Line has the most of any Metro-North main line. Its northern [[Terminal station|terminal]], [[Wassaic (Metro-North station)|Wassaic]], is the northernmost station in the system. It is the only Metro-North line used exclusively by that carrier (no use by [[Amtrak]], though [[CSX]] services freight customers as far north as [[Mount Vernon, New York|Mount Vernon]]) and the only one that uses the entirety of existing track. Metro-North has assigned it the [[color code]] blue, used as trim on station signs and [[spot color]] on printed [[Public transport timetable|timetables]]. The blue color-coding appears to have started with timetables issued by predecessor [[New York Central]] for the then-Harlem Division as far back as 1965.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iridetheharlemline.com/2012/09/21/the-harlem-line-and-the-color-blue/|title=The Harlem Line, and the color blue|last=Moser|first=Emily|date=September 21, 2012|website=I Ride The Harlem Line...|access-date=June 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile the line has traditionally served to bring commuters from [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] to jobs in the city, since the 2000s it has begun to see more \"[[reverse commute|reverse commuting]]\" from the Bronx into Westchester and points north. The northern reaches of the line are also close enough to [[Western Massachusetts]] that residents in parts of that region are also able to commute to jobs in New York City.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|1}}<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n==Line description==\n[[File:Railway map around New York City.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Railway diagram of intercity services around New York City, showing Penn Station and [[Grand Central Terminal]]]]\nThe Harlem Line hews closely to roads along [[river]]-based transportation corridors dating back to even pre-rail times. It follows three major [[parkway]]s closely from the Bronx northwards through Westchester: the [[Bronx River Parkway]] (and a short portion that becomes the [[Taconic State Parkway]]), the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] and [[Interstate 684]]. In the last section it also begins to run close to [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]], the long north-south two-lane state highway that parallels the eastern border of the state. In Westchester, it serves some of that county's most affluent communities as it slowly trends eastward.\n\n===Manhattan and the Bronx===\nThe Harlem Line begins underground at [[Grand Central Terminal]], on the [[Park Avenue main line]]. The train tracks leave underground north of 97th Street and run on an elevated [[viaduct]] starting at 102nd Street in Manhattan. After stopping at [[Harlem\u2013125th Street (Metro-North station)|Harlem\u2013125th Street]], the Harlem Line crosses the Harlem River at 135th Street in [[Manhattan]], entering [[the Bronx]] via the [[Park Avenue Bridge (New York City)|Park Avenue Bridge]]. The train tracks go into [[Cut (earthmoving)|open-cut]] north of 144th Street.\n\nIn the Bronx, the Harlem Line cuts through the neighborhoods of the southwest Bronx, with two stations: [[Melrose (Metro-North station)|Melrose]], at 162nd Street (it then runs under the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]) and [[Tremont (Metro-North station)|Tremont]], at 177th Street. [[Fordham (Metro-North station)|Fordham]] station is next, at Fordham Road (190th Street). The tracks rise to ground level after the Fordham station. The Harlem Line then parallels the western edge of [[Fordham University]] until the [[Botanical Garden (Metro-North station)|Botanical Garden]] station at Bedford Park Boulevard (200th Street).\n\nThe Harlem Line then cuts northeast to join the Bronx River Parkway, which lies to the east of the tracks. The [[Williams Bridge (Metro-North station)|Williams Bridge]] station is next, at Gun Hill Road (210th Street). After the Williams Bridge station, [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] begins to the west of the tracks, with [[Webster Avenue]] in between the cemetery and tracks. The [[Woodlawn (Metro-North station)|Woodlawn]] station is at 233rd Street, and it is north of here that the [[New Haven Line]] diverges to head east towards the [[Northeast Corridor]].\n\nThe Harlem Line then goes under a bridge for the parkway, and it remains to the west of the tracks until [[Scarsdale (Metro-North station)|Scarsdale]] station. The [[Wakefield (Metro-North station)|Wakefield]] station at 241st Street concludes the Bronx portion of the Harlem Line.\n\n===Westchester County===\nThe [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] portion of the Harlem Line begins at Bronx River Road in southeastern [[Yonkers]]. After the [[Mount Vernon West (Metro-North station)|Mount Vernon West]] station, the Harlem Line runs along the on-ramp to the [[Cross County Parkway]] eastbound, right before Fleetwood station. After the [[Bronxville (Metro-North station)|Bronxville]] station, the Harlem Line parallels the [[Bronx River Parkway]] all the way up to [[White Plains (Metro-North station)|White Plains]].\n\nFrom White Plains, the railroad winds its way through the city and passing through the yards at [[North White Plains (Metro-North station)|North White Plains]], which was the northern boundary of third-rail electrification until 1984. The stretch north of North White Plains is unique because it is the only third-rail electrified stretch of Metro-North's network that has [[grade crossing]]s, a byproduct of its existence pre-electrification. [[Katonah (Metro-North station)|Katonah]] and [[Brewster (Metro-North station)|Brewster]] stations are located right next to [[grade crossings]].\n\nAfter North White Plains, the next station is [[Valhalla (Metro-North station)|Valhalla]] adjacent to the Taconic State Parkway. The double-track railroad then curves to follow the [[Saw Mill River]] Valley and the eponymous parkway. Rail and road briefly separate at [[Mount Kisco (Metro-North station)|Mount Kisco]], but then remain close by at the last stop along the Saw Mill, [[Bedford Hills (Metro-North station)|Bedford Hills]] (although the parkway cannot be seen from the station).\n\nPast Katonah, the railroad runs between the [[Croton River]] and I-684. [[Golden's Bridge (Metro-North station)|Golden's Bridge]] and [[Purdy's (Metro-North station)|Purdy's]] are both located very close to the interstate, although only the former can be seen from it. North of the latter, the tracks follow the river to [[Croton Falls (Metro-North station)|Croton Falls]], and pick up Route 22 for the first time.\n\n===Putnam County===\nAfter Croton Falls station, the Harlem Line runs along [[East Branch Reservoir]] and crosses into Putnam County and its rural landscape. Above Brewster station, the railroad passes through the yards at Putnam Junction to [[Southeast (Metro-North station)|Southeast]] station, which was formerly known as Brewster North. This is the northern boundary of [[third rail]] electrification.<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|I-2}} \n\nNorth of Southeast, the line operates with a single track and uses diesel locomotives. This section is also known as the Wassaic Branch. Prior to the 2010s, the branch was not signalized, and manual block system rules were used to direct train movements;<ref name=\":3\" />{{Rp|I-2}} however, [[positive train control]] was installed in the late 2010s.<ref>{{cite web | last=Kazmi | first=Aleeza | title=Positive Train Control Testing Begins On LIRR, Metro-North | website=WSHU | date=October 16, 2018 | url=https://www.wshu.org/post/positive-train-control-testing-begins-lirr-metro-north | access-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref> The track finally follows its own course, away from any road or river, past the former Dykemans and abandoned [[Towners (NYCRR station)|Towners]] stations up to [[Patterson (Metro-North station)|Patterson]] and into Dutchess County.\n\n===Dutchess County===\nShortly before reaching [[Pawling (Metro-North station)|Pawling]], the line enters the Harlem Valley (which takes its name from the railroad) and begins to parallel Route 22, although not as closely as it did the roads further south. A few miles north of Pawling, the [[Appalachian Trail]] crossing has [[Appalachian Trail (Metro-North station)|its own stop]] to allow [[Thru-hiking|thru-hikers]] to take a break in the city and day hikers to visit the nearby [[Pawling Nature Preserve]].\n\nThe next two stops, [[Harlem Valley\u2013Wingdale (Metro-North station)|Harlem Valley\u2013Wingdale]] and [[Dover Plains (Metro-North station)|Dover Plains]], are roughly eight miles (13&nbsp;km) apart, the longest distance between any two stops on the Harlem Line. From 1972 to 2000, Dover Plains was the last stop on the line, but then tracks remaining from the NYCRR era that had not yet been torn up were renovated and the line was extended to [[Tenmile River (Metro-North station)|Tenmile River]] and its new northern terminus, [[Wassaic (Metro-North station)|Wassaic]]. The total travel time between Grand Central and Wassaic is 2 hours on a peak through train.\n\nA small [[rail yard|yard]] where diesel trains await their routes just past the station marks the end of the line.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|New York and Harlem Railroad}}\n\n=== Origin as a streetcar line ===\n[[File:1847_Lower_Manhattan_map.jpg|thumb|An 1847 map of [[Lower Manhattan]]; the only railroad in Manhattan at that time was the New York and Harlem Railroad]]\nThe Harlem Line in its current form originated from the New York and Harlem Railroad (NY&H), which was the first streetcar company in the [[United States]].

In 1836 amendment to its charter granted it the right to enter Manhattan along a route that they \"may deem most eligible\"\u2013direct competition to the NY&H.

Initially, the work was to be completed by the end of 1983, but due to a strike, its completion was delayed to 1984. Initially, service was provided with a mixture of new and old electric cars, but these were replaced by the new [[M1/M3 (railcar)|M3A]]s.

Reverse-peak trains were able to run every 30 minutes instead of every 90 minutes, helping fuel a 30 percent increase in ridership along the line through Southern Westchester and the Bronx. Most of the new reverse-peak users came from the Bronx. The increased service helped revitalize White Plains' downtown, helping anchor the economy of central Westchester.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rauchfoundation.org/files/9913/5818/7008/How_the_LIRR_Could_Shape_the_Next_Economy.pdf|title=How the Long Island Rail Road Could Shape the Next Economy|date=2013|website=rauchfoundation.org|publisher=Regional Plan Association|pages=11\u201312|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref> Express trains could skip stops via the express track while additional local trains could make stops in Westchester and the Bronx.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/rail-line-upgrade-boosting-ridership-article-1.559742|title=RAIL LINE UPGRADE BOOSTING RIDERSHIP|last=Egbert|first=Bill|date=July 21, 2005|work=NY Daily News|access-date=June 21, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Purchase by the MTA===\nOn November 13, 2018, the MTA announced its intent to purchase the Hudson and Harlem Lines as well as the Grand Central Terminal for up to $35.065 million, plus a [[Interest rate#Related terms|discount rate]] of 6.25%.<ref name=purchase/> The purchase would include all inventory, operations, improvements, and maintenance associated with each asset, except for the air rights over Grand Central.

It has received attention due to speculation that it is actually several centuries older and would thus represent evidence of [[pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]]. Carbon dating shows this belief to be incorrect.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Newport Tower is located in Touro Park at the top of Mill Street, surrounded by a historical residential neighborhood on the hill above the waterfront tourist district.  Eighteenth-century paintings show that the hill itself once furnished a view of the harbor and would have been visible to passing mariners in [[Narragansett Bay]],<ref>[http://www.chronognostic.org/pdf/Tower_painting_1777x.pdf Painting attributed to Gilbert Stuart] (c1770s): Redwood Library and Athenaeum, via chronognostic.org</ref> but recent tree growth now obscures the view.\n\nThe Newport Tower is not exactly circular. From southeast to northwest, the diameter reportedly measures {{convert|22|ft|2|in|m}} but, when measured from east to west, the diameter lengthens to {{convert|23|ft|3|in|m}}.<ref>Holand, Hjalmar R. \"America 1355\u20131364\" Duell, Sloan and Pearce (1946)</ref> However, the 19th-century measurements of the interior gave an east\u2013west dimension of {{convert|18|ft|4|in|m}}, which was slightly shorter than the north\u2013south measurement of {{convert|19|ft|9|in|m}},<ref>Rafn, C.C.

The tower has a height of {{convert|28|ft|m}} and an exterior width of {{convert|24|ft|m}}.  At one time, the interior of the tower was coated with smooth white plaster, the remnants of which may be seen on the interior faces of several pillars.  It is supported by eight cylindrical columns that form stone [[arch]]es, two of which are slightly broader than the other six.  Above the arches and inside the tower is evidence of a floor that once supported an interior chamber.  The walls are approximately {{convert|3|ft|m}} thick, and the diameter of the inner chamber is approximately {{convert|18|ft|m}}.  The chamber has four windows on what used to be the main floor, and three very small ones at the upper level. Almost directly opposite the west window is a fireplace backed with grey stone and flanked by nooks.<ref name=\"habs\"/><ref>[http://www.chronognostic.org/pdf/means_elevation.pdf \"Unrolled\" interior elevation of the Tower] ''about 1% missing at right end'', chronognostic.org- accessed 2007-12-11</ref>\n\nA representation of the tower is featured prominently on the [[Seal (device)|seal]] and unit patch of the former [[US Navy]] vessel [[USS Newport (LST-1179)|USS ''Newport'']].\n[[Image:Chesterton-1836.png|thumb|Nothing in early [[Norse architecture]] is similar to the Newport Tower in size or appearance.

As part of the investigation, a one-meter-wide trench was dug from the tower's exterior through the interior.  The results were published in Godfrey's 1951 Ph.D. dissertation and concluded that all the artifacts discovered were from the 17th century. Godfrey's dissertation identifies Benedict Arnold as the builder of the tower, stating that Arnold \"purchased some of his Newport property, specifically the section on which he later built his house and the stone mill, the year before he moved.... At some period before 1677 Arnold built the Old Stone Mill.\"<ref>Godfrey, ''Digging a Tower and Laying a Ghost'', p.5</ref>\n\nThere is no evidence for Godfrey's assertion that Arnold \"built his house\" in Newport.

This hypothesis is predicated on the uncertainty of the southward extent of the early [[Norsemen|Norse]] explorations of North America, particularly in regard to the actual location of [[Vinland]].\nRafn's popularization of the theory led to a flurry of interest and \"proofs\" of Norse settlement in the area.<ref>[http://www.neara.org/CARLSON/newporttower.htm N.E.A.R.A. essay by S.

His assertion is incorrect that a windmill would not have fireplaces because of the fire risk.<ref>Derek Ogden, \"Fireplaces Are Common in Tower Windmills,\" 'Newport Daily News', 23\u201324 March 1996.</ref> Several have fireplaces aligned with windows, and it is not unusual to find a double flue exiting the wall, generally with the exits aligned parallel to the prevailing wind to improve the updraft on a relatively short flue. A conventional chimney could not be used, as it would foul the turning cap and sails of the windmill.\n\nExamples include the later-built (ca. 1750s) [[Upholland]] Windmill, [[Lancashire]], where the fireplace is at [[Storey#North American scheme|second floor]] level ([[Storey#European scheme|first floor]] in [[British English]]), as well as [[List of windmills in Shropshire|Much Wenlock windmill]], [[Shropshire]], which has double flues of uncertain purpose rising from the middle floor level, which was constructed in the 18th century.<ref>[http://www.muchwenlockguide.info/windmill-trust/wt-details.shtml Much Wenlock Windmill Trust]</ref> Both of the above cited examples post-date the earliest surviving mention of the Stone Mill in a 28 February 1677 deed.\n\n[[Image:Newport Tower Rhode Island.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Newport Tower, 2008]]\n\n===Observatory hypothesis===\nFour of the eight supporting pillars of the tower face the main points of the compass. In the 1990s, William Penhallow, a Professor of Physics and astronomer at the [[University of Rhode Island]], studied the windows in the tower and said that he found a number of astronomical alignments. At the summer solstice the setting sun should shine through the \"west\" window (actually just south of true west) onto a niche in the inner wall, next to the \"south\" window. (This no longer happens due to urban development and park trees.) Similarly, the angle from the \"east\" window through the \"west\" window is about 18 degrees south of west, which is the southern extreme of moonsets during what is known as the \"[[lunar standstill|lunar minor standstill]]\". The smaller windows also form alignments, on significant stars. These alignments could be accidental, but if they were deliberate it would explain why the pattern of windows seems, according to Penhallow, \"so odd\".<ref>{{Cite journal| bibcode=1997BaltA...6...71P | title=Archaeoastronomy: the Newport Tower | journal=Baltic Astronomy | volume=6 | publisher=Baltic Astronomy, vol. 6, 71 | date=1997 | author=Penhallow, William| doi=10.1515/astro-1997-0113 | doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n===Chinese===\nAuthor [[Gavin Menzies]] argues in ''1421: The Year China Discovered America'' that the tower was built by a colony of Chinese sailors and concubines from the junks of [[Zheng He]]'s voyages either as a lighthouse or as an observatory to determine the longitude of the colony, based on Penhallow's findings.<ref name=\"penhallow1\">Penhallow, William S.

The investigation was directed by Hugh Henken of [[Harvard University]], with the field work headed by William S. Godfrey.  As part of the investigation, a one-meter-wide trench was dug from the tower's exterior through the interior.  The results were published in Godfrey's 1951 Ph.D. dissertation and concluded that all the artifacts discovered were from the 17th century. Godfrey's dissertation identifies Benedict Arnold as the builder of the tower, stating that Arnold \"purchased some of his Newport property, specifically the section on which he later built his house and the stone mill, the year before he moved.... At some period before 1677 Arnold built the Old Stone Mill.\"<ref>Godfrey, ''Digging a Tower and Laying a Ghost'', p.5</ref>\n\nThere is no evidence for Godfrey's assertion that Arnold \"built his house\" in Newport. From Godfrey's thesis: \"It is strongly suggested by the records that he purchased some of his Newport property, specifically the section on which he later built his house and the Stone Mill, the year before he moved. (Thompkins, 1919, quoting Roger Williams, 1650) The original owner had been Jeremy Clarke, but there is no indication that Clarke ever built on the property.\"\n\nThompkins wrote: \u201cIt will be noticed as an evidence of Benedict Arnold's prominence that his name is mentioned first in the order, rather than his father, and as an indication of his increasing wealth at the assessment of taxes in Providence in 1650, Benedict Arnold's amount was put at \u00a35, the largest sum assessed against any one individual.

This hypothesis is predicated on the uncertainty of the southward extent of the early [[Norsemen|Norse]] explorations of North America, particularly in regard to the actual location of [[Vinland]].\nRafn's popularization of the theory led to a flurry of interest and \"proofs\" of Norse settlement in the area.<ref>[http://www.neara.org/CARLSON/newporttower.htm N.E.A.R.A. essay by S.

His assertion is incorrect that a windmill would not have fireplaces because of the fire risk.<ref>Derek Ogden, \"Fireplaces Are Common in Tower Windmills,\" 'Newport Daily News', 23\u201324 March 1996.</ref> Several have fireplaces aligned with windows, and it is not unusual to find a double flue exiting the wall, generally with the exits aligned parallel to the prevailing wind to improve the updraft on a relatively short flue. A conventional chimney could not be used, as it would foul the turning cap and sails of the windmill.\n\nExamples include the later-built (ca. 1750s) [[Upholland]] Windmill, [[Lancashire]], where the fireplace is at [[Storey#North American scheme|second floor]] level ([[Storey#European scheme|first floor]] in [[British English]]), as well as [[List of windmills in Shropshire|Much Wenlock windmill]], [[Shropshire]], which has double flues of uncertain purpose rising from the middle floor level, which was constructed in the 18th century.<ref>[http://www.muchwenlockguide.info/windmill-trust/wt-details.shtml Much Wenlock Windmill Trust]</ref> Both of the above cited examples post-date the earliest surviving mention of the Stone Mill in a 28 February 1677 deed.\n\n[[Image:Newport Tower Rhode Island.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Newport Tower, 2008]]\n\n===Observatory hypothesis===\nFour of the eight supporting pillars of the tower face the main points of the compass. In the 1990s, William Penhallow, a Professor of Physics and astronomer at the [[University of Rhode Island]], studied the windows in the tower and said that he found a number of astronomical alignments. At the summer solstice the setting sun should shine through the \"west\" window (actually just south of true west) onto a niche in the inner wall, next to the \"south\" window. (This no longer happens due to urban development and park trees.) Similarly, the angle from the \"east\" window through the \"west\" window is about 18 degrees south of west, which is the southern extreme of moonsets during what is known as the \"[[lunar standstill|lunar minor standstill]]\". The smaller windows also form alignments, on significant stars. These alignments could be accidental, but if they were deliberate it would explain why the pattern of windows seems, according to Penhallow, \"so odd\".<ref>{{Cite journal| bibcode=1997BaltA...6...71P | title=Archaeoastronomy: the Newport Tower | journal=Baltic Astronomy | volume=6 | publisher=Baltic Astronomy, vol. 6, 71 | date=1997 | author=Penhallow, William| doi=10.1515/astro-1997-0113 | doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n===Chinese===\nAuthor [[Gavin Menzies]] argues in ''1421: The Year China Discovered America'' that the tower was built by a colony of Chinese sailors and concubines from the junks of [[Zheng He]]'s voyages either as a lighthouse or as an observatory to determine the longitude of the colony, based on Penhallow's findings.<ref name=\"penhallow1\">Penhallow, William S.

Lightning causes [[thunder]], a sound from the [[shock wave]] which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during [[thunderstorm]]s and other types of energetic [[weather]] systems, but [[volcanic lightning]] can also occur during volcanic eruptions.\n\nThe three main kinds of lightning are distinguished by where they occur: either inside a single [[thundercloud]], between two different clouds, or between a cloud and the ground. Many other observational variants are recognized, including \"[[heat lightning]]\", which can be seen from a great distance but not heard; [[dry lightning]], which can cause [[forest fires]]; and [[ball lightning]], which is rarely observed scientifically.\n\nHumans have [[Lightning in religion|deified lightning]] for millennia, and lightning-inspired expressions like \"bolt from the blue\", \"to be struck by lightning\" (as to having an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] or [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]), \"lightning never strikes twice (in the same place)\" and \"[[blitzkrieg]]\" are in common usage.

The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from {{convert|-15|to|-25|C|F}}; see Figure 1. At that place, the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets (small water droplets below freezing), small ice crystals, and [[graupel]] (soft hail). The updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward. At the same time, the graupel, which is considerably larger and denser, tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air.<ref name=\"NOAA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/science/science_electrication.htm |title=NWS Lightning Safety: Understanding Lightning: Thunderstorm Electrification |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=25 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130080723/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/science/science_electrication.htm |archivedate=November 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Graupel animation 3a.gif|thumb|left|(Figure 2) When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel, the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged.]]\n\nThe differences in the movement of the precipitation cause collisions to occur. When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel, the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged; see Figure 2. The updraft carries the positively charged ice crystals upward toward the top of the storm cloud.

This part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil. While this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud, some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm (updrafts and downdrafts). In addition, there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures.<ref name=\"NOAA\"/>\n\n==General considerations==\n[[File:LightningCNP.ogg|thumb|left|Four-second video of a lightning strike, Island in the Sky, [[Canyonlands National Park]], [[Utah]], United States.]]\n\nA typical cloud-to-ground lightning flash culminates in the formation of an electrically conducting [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] channel through the air in excess of {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} tall, from within the cloud to the ground's surface.

These factors include ground elevation, [[latitude]], [[prevailing wind]] currents, [[relative humidity]], proximity to warm and cold bodies of water, etc. To a certain degree, the ratio between IC (in-cloud or intracloud), CC (cloud-to-cloud) and CG (cloud-to-ground) lightning may also vary by [[season]] in [[middle latitudes]].\n\nBecause human beings are terrestrial and most of their possessions are on the Earth where lightning can damage or destroy them, CG lightning is the most studied and best understood of the three types, even though IC and CC are more common types of lightning. Lightning's relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs, even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation.\nAbout 70% of lightning occurs over land in the [[tropics]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5oZUAAAAMAAJ&q=70%25+of+lightning+occurs+in+tropics+on+land&dq=70%25+of+lightning+occurs+in+tropics+on+land|title=Encyclopedia of atmospheric sciences|last=Holton|first=James R.|last2=Curry|first2=Judith A.|last3=Pyle|first3=J.

The flow of warm ocean currents past drier land masses, such as the [[Gulf stream|Gulf Stream]], partially explains the elevated frequency of lightning in the [[Southeast United States]]. Because large bodies of water lack the topographic variation that would result in atmospheric mixing, lightning is notably less frequent over the world's oceans than over land. The [[north pole|North]] and [[south pole|South Poles]] are limited in their coverage of thunderstorms and therefore result in areas with the least amount of lightning.{{Clarify|reason=absence of thunderstorms is similar to absence of lightning; an explanation of why are there less thunderstorms (lightning) above the poles would be more helpful|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn general, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flashes account for only 25% of all total lightning flashes worldwide. Since the base of a thunderstorm is usually negatively charged, this is where most CG lightning originates. This region is typically at the elevation where [[freezing level|freezing]] occurs within the cloud. Freezing, combined with collisions between ice and water, appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process. During wind-driven collisions, ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge, while a heavier, slushy mixture of ice and water (called [[graupel]]) develops a negative charge. Updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel, causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive [[space charge]] while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge.\n\n[[File:2013-08-07 04-23-26-foudre-belfort.jpg|thumb|Lightning in [[Belfort]], France]]\n\nBecause the concentrated charge within the cloud must exceed the insulating properties of air, and this increases proportionally to the distance between the cloud and the ground, the proportion of CG strikes (versus cloud-to-cloud (CC) or in-cloud (IC) discharges) becomes greater when the cloud is closer to the ground. In the tropics, where the freezing level is generally higher in the atmosphere, only 10% of lightning flashes are CG. At the latitude of Norway (around 60\u00b0 North latitude), where the freezing elevation is lower, 50% of lightning is CG.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast05dec_1/|date=December 5, 2001|title=Where LightningStrikes|publisher=NASA Science.

The atmosphere provides the electrical insulation, or barrier, that prevents free equalization between charged regions of opposite polarity.\n\nIt is well understood that during a thunderstorm there is charge separation and aggregation in certain regions of the cloud; however the exact processes by which this occurs are not fully understood.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1993)032<0642:AROTEP>2.0.CO;2|volume=32|title=A Review of Thunderstorm Electrification Processes |last1=Saunders|first1=C. P. R.|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology |issue=4 |pages=642\u201355|bibcode=1993JApMe..32..642S |year=1993}}</ref>\n\n===Electrical field generation===\n[[File:LightningAboveCloudsView.JPG|thumb|View of lightning from an airplane flying above a system.]]\n\nAs a [[Cumulonimbus cloud|thundercloud]] moves over the surface of the Earth, an equal [[electric charge]], but of opposite polarity, is [[Electrostatic induction|induced]] on the Earth's surface underneath the cloud. The induced positive surface charge, when measured against a fixed point, will be small as the thundercloud approaches, increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes. The referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve.\n\nThe oppositely charged regions create an [[electric field]] within the air between them. This electric field varies in relation to the strength of the surface charge on the base of the thundercloud \u2013 the greater the accumulated charge, the higher the electrical field.\n\n== Flashes and strikes ==\nThe best studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground (CG). Although more common, intracloud (IC) and cloud to cloud (CC) flashes are very difficult to study given there are no \"physical\" points to monitor inside the clouds. Also, given the very low probability lightning will strike the same point repeatedly and consistently, scientific inquiry is difficult at best even in the areas of high CG frequency. As such, knowing flash propagation is similar amongst all forms of lightning, the best means to describe the process is through an examination of the most studied form, cloud to ground.[[File:Desert Electric.jpg|thumb|A lightning strike from cloud to ground in the [[Mojave Desert]], California]] \n[[File:Florescent cloud blanket.jpg|thumb|An intracloud flash. A lightning flash within the cloud, illuminates the entire blanket.]]\n\n=== Lightning leaders ===\n[[File:Lightning formation.gif|thumb|Lightning formation|thumb|A downward leader travels towards earth, branching as it goes.]]\n[[File:Leaderlightnig.gif|thumbnail|Lightning strike caused by the connection of two leaders, positive shown in blue and negative in red]]\n\nIn a process not well understood, a bidirectional channel of [[ionized]] air, called a \"[[leader (spark)|leader]]\", is initiated between oppositely-charged regions in a thundercloud. Leaders are electrically conductive channels of ionized gas that propagate through, or are otherwise attracted to, regions with a charge opposite of that of the leader tip. The negative end of the bidirectional leader fills a positive charge region, also called a well, inside the cloud while the positive end fills a negative charge well. Leaders often split, forming branches in a tree-like pattern.<ref>Ultraslow-motion video of stepped leader propagation: [http://www.ztresearch.com/ ztresearch.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413125231/http://www.ztresearch.com/ |date=April 13, 2010 }}</ref> In addition, negative and some positive leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion, in a process called \"stepping\". The resulting jerky movement of the leaders can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of lightning flashes.\n\nIt is possible for one end of the leader to fill the oppositely-charged well entirely while the other end is still active. When this happens, the leader end which filled the well may propagate outside of the thundercloud and result in either a cloud-to-air flash or a cloud-to-ground flash. In a typical cloud-to-ground flash, a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a thundercloud. The weaker positive charge region is filled quickly by the negative leader which then propagates toward the inductively-charged ground.\n\nThe positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions, positive upwards within the cloud and [[Electric charge|negative]] towards the earth. Both ionic channels proceed, in their respective directions, in a number of successive spurts. Each leader \"pools\" ions at the leading tips, shooting out one or more new leaders, momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions, then shooting out another leader. The negative leader continues to propagate and split as it heads downward, often speeding up as it gets closer to the Earth's surface.\n\nAbout 90% of ionic channel lengths between \"pools\" are approximately {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.<ref>Goulde, R.H. (1977) \"The lightning conductor\", pp. 545\u2013576 in ''Lightning Protection'', R.H. Golde, Ed., ''Lightning, Vol. 2'', Academic Press.</ref> The establishment of the ionic channel takes a comparatively long amount of time (hundreds of [[millisecond]]s) in comparison to the resulting discharge, which occurs within a few dozen microseconds. The [[electric current]] needed to establish the channel, measured in the tens or hundreds of [[ampere]]s, is dwarfed by subsequent currents during the actual discharge.\n\nInitiation of the lightning leaders is not well understood. The electric field strength within the thundercloud is not typically large enough to initiate this process by itself.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11214-008-9338-z|title=Charge Structure and Dynamics in Thunderstorms|date=2008|last1=Stolzenburg|first1=Maribeth|last2=Marshall|first2=Thomas C.|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=137|issue=1\u20134|page=355|bibcode = 2008SSRv..137..355S }}</ref> Many hypotheses have been proposed. One theory postulates that showers of relativistic electrons are created by [[cosmic rays]] and are then accelerated to higher velocities via a process called [[runaway breakdown]]. As these relativistic electrons collide and ionize neutral air molecules, they initiate leader formation.

The electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest to the base of the thundercloud, such as trees and tall buildings. If the electric field is strong enough, a positively charged ionic channel, called a positive or upward [[Streamer discharge|streamer]], can develop from these points. This was first theorized by Heinz Kasemir.<ref>Kasemir, H. W.

Photographs have been taken in which unattached streamers are clearly visible. The unattached downward leaders are also visible in branched lightning, none of which are connected to the earth, although it may appear they are. High-speed videos can show the attachment process in progress.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1002/2017GL072796|title = Lightning attachment process to common buildings|journal = Geophysical Research Letters|volume = 44|issue = 9|pages = 4368\u20134375|year = 2017|last1 = Saba|first1 = M.

Electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the point of attachment, which expands across the entire leader network at a fraction of the speed of light. This is the 'return stroke' and it is the most [[Luminous intensity|luminous]] and noticeable part of the lightning discharge.\n\nA large electric current flows along the plasma channel from the cloud to the ground, neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow away from the strike point to the surrounding area. This huge surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along the surface of the ground. Called step potentials, they are responsible for more injuries and deaths than the strike itself.<ref>See, for example, [https://www.livescience.com/55916-why-reindeer-killed-by-lightning.html here]</ref> Electricity takes every path available to it.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Path of Least Resistance|url=http://ecmweb.com/content/path-least-resistance|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104215214/http://ecmweb.com/content/path-least-resistance|archivedate=January 4, 2016|df=mdy-all|date=July 2001}}</ref>\nA portion of the return stroke current will often preferentially flow through one leg and out another, electrocuting an unlucky human or animal standing near the point where the lightning strikes.\n\nThe electric current of the return stroke averages 30 kiloamperes for a typical negative CG flash, often referred to as \"negative CG\" lightning. In some cases, a ground to cloud (GC) lightning flash may originate from a positively charged region on the ground below a storm. These discharges normally originate from the tops of very tall structures, such as communications antennas. The rate at which the return stroke current travels has been found to be around 100,000&nbsp;km/s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Idone | first1 = V. P. | last2 = Orville | first2 = R.

The core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed 50,000 K, causing it to brilliantly radiate with a blue-white color. Once the electric current stops flowing, the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds, often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas. The nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to expand explosively, producing a powerful [[shock wave]] which is heard as [[#Thunder|thunder]].\n\n====Re-strike====\nHigh-speed videos (examined frame-by-frame) show that most negative CG lightning flashes are made up of 3 or 4 individual strokes, though there may be as many as 30.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 5, p. 41.</ref>\n\nEach re-strike is separated by a relatively large amount of time, typically 40 to 50 milliseconds, as other charged regions in the cloud are discharged in subsequent strokes. Re-strikes often cause a noticeable \"[[strobe light]]\" effect.<ref name=\"uman\">[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] pp. 103\u2013110.</ref>\n\nTo understand why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel, one needs to understand the behavior of positive leaders, which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader's connection with the ground. Positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do. For reasons not well understood, bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on the tips of the decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network. These leaders, also called ''recoil leaders'', usually decay shortly after their formation. When they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network, a return stroke-like process occurs and a ''dart leader'' travels across all or a portion of the length of the original leader. The dart leaders making connections with the ground are what cause a majority of subsequent return strokes.<ref name=\"Warner\">{{cite web |url=https://ztresearch.blog/education/ground-flashes/ |title=Ground Flashes |last=Warner |first=Tom |website=ZT Research |access-date=2017-11-09|date=2017-05-06 }}</ref>\n\nEach successive stroke is preceded by intermediate dart leader strokes that have a faster rise time but lower amplitude than the initial return stroke. Each subsequent stroke usually re-uses the discharge channel taken by the previous one, but the channel may be offset from its previous position as wind displaces the hot channel.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 9, p. 78.</ref>\n\nSince recoil and dart leader processes do not occur on negative leaders, subsequent return strokes very seldom utilize the same channel on positive ground flashes which are explained later in the article.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\n====Transient currents during flash====\nThe electric current within a typical negative CG lightning discharge rises very quickly to its peak value in 1\u201310 microseconds, then decays more slowly over 50\u2013200 microseconds. The transient nature of the current within a lightning flash results in several phenomena that need to be addressed in the effective protection of ground-based structures. Rapidly changing currents tend to travel on the surface of a conductor, in what is called the [[skin effect]], unlike direct currents, which \"flow-through\" the entire conductor like water through a hose. Hence, conductors used in the protection of facilities tend to be multi-stranded, with small wires woven together. This increases the total bundle [[surface area]] in inverse proportion to the individual strand radius, for a fixed total [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]].\n\nThe rapidly changing currents also create [[Electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulses (EMPs)]] that radiate outward from the ionic channel. This is a characteristic of all electrical discharges. The radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases.

Different [[common name]]s used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or different events.\n\n=== Cloud to ground (CG) ===\n[[File:Lightning strikes mountain top.jpg|thumb|right|''Cloud to ground'' lightning]]\nCloud-to-ground (CG) lightning is a lightning discharge between a thundercloud and the ground. It is initiated by a stepped leader moving down from the cloud, which is met by a streamer moving up from the ground.\n\nCG is the least common, but best understood of all types of lightning.  It is easier to study scientifically, because it terminates on a physical object, namely the Earth, and lends itself to being measured by instruments on the ground. Of the three primary types of lightning, it poses the greatest threat to life and property since it terminates or \"strikes\" the Earth. \nThe overall discharge, termed a flash, is composed of a number of processes such as preliminary breakdown, stepped leaders, connecting leaders, return strokes, dart leaders and subsequent return strokes.<ref>V.

Most CG lightning is negative, meaning that a negative charge is transferred to ground and electrons travel downward along the lightning channel. The reverse happens in a positive CG flash, where electrons travel upward along the lightning channel and a positive charge is transferred to the ground. Positive lightning is less common than negative lightning, and on average makes up less than 5% of all lightning strikes.<ref>{{cite web | title = NWS JetStream \u2013 The Positive and Negative Side of Lightning | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/lightning/positive.htm | accessdate = September 25, 2007 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070705205815/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/lightning/positive.htm | archivedate = July 5, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anvil-to-ground lightning.jpg|thumb|A ''bolt from the blue'' lightning strike which appears to initiate from the clear, but turbulent sky above the [[anvil cloud]] and drive a bolt of plasma through the cloud directly to the ground.

When it occurs between two separate clouds it is known as ''inter-cloud lightning'', and when it occurs between areas of differing [[electric potential]] within a single cloud it is known as ''intra-cloud lightning''. Intra-cloud lightning is the most frequently occurring type.<ref name=\"GHCC primer2\" />\n\nIntra-cloud lightning most commonly occurs between the upper [[cumulonimbus incus|anvil]] portion and lower reaches of a given thunderstorm. This lightning can sometimes be observed at great distances at night as so-called \"[[sheet lightning]]\". In such instances, the observer may see only a flash of light without hearing any thunder.\n\n [[File:Anvil Crawler over Lake Wright Patman south of Redwater, Texas..JPG|thumb|Anvil Crawler over Lake Wright Patman south of Redwater, Texas on the backside of a large area of rain associated with a cold-front]]\nAnother term used for cloud\u2013cloud or cloud\u2013cloud\u2013ground lightning is \"Anvil Crawler\", due to the habit of charge, typically originating beneath or within the anvil and scrambling through the upper cloud layers of a thunderstorm, often generating dramatic multiple branch strokes. These are usually seen as a thunderstorm passes over the observer or begins to decay. The most vivid crawler behavior occurs in well developed thunderstorms that feature extensive rear anvil shearing.\n\n=== Observational variations ===\n* '''Anvil crawler lightning''', sometimes called '''Spider lightning''' is created when leaders propagate through horizontally-extensive charge regions in mature thunderstorms, usually the stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems. These discharges usually begin as intracloud discharges originating within the convective region; the negative leader end then propagates well into the aforementioned charge regions in the stratiform area. If the leader becomes too long, it may separate into multiple bidirectional leaders. When this happens, the positive end of the separated leader may strike the ground as a positive CG flash or crawl on the underside of the cloud, creating a spectacular display of lightning crawling across the sky. Ground flashes produced in this manner tend to transfer high amounts of charge, and this can trigger upward lightning flashes and upper-atmospheric lightning.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n*'''[[Ball lightning]]''' may be an [[atmospheric electricity|atmospheric electrical]] phenomenon, the physical nature of which is still [[controversial]].

Buildings or tall structures hit by lightning may be damaged as the lightning seeks unintended paths to ground. By safely conducting a lightning strike to ground, a lightning protection system can greatly reduce the probability of severe property damage. Lightning also serves an important role in the [[nitrogen cycle]] by oxidizing diatomic nitrogen in the air into [[nitrates]] which are deposited by rain and can fertilize the growth of plants and other organisms.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = D.W. | last2 = Steiger | first2 = S. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = R. | last4 = Tie | first4 = X. | last5 = Orville | first5 = R.E. | year = 2002 | title = The importance of NOx production by lightning in the tropics | url = | journal = Atmospheric Environment | volume = 36 | issue = 9| pages = 1509\u20131519 | doi=10.1016/s1352-2310(01)00553-2| bibcode = 2002AtmEn..36.1509B }}</ref><ref>Pickering, K.E., Bucsela, E., Allen, D, Cummings, K., Li, Y., MacGorman, D., Bruning, E. 2014.

Due to the conductive properties of [[Aluminium alloy]], the fuselage acts as a [[Faraday cage]].\n\n=== Thunder ===\n{{main|Thunder}}\n\nBecause the electrostatic discharge of terrestrial lightning superheats the air to plasma temperatures along the length of the discharge channel in a short duration, [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a [[shock wave]] audible as thunder. Since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length of the lightning's path, the sound origin's varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect. Perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel, by [[echo (phenomenon)|acoustic echoing]] from terrain, and by the usually multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike.\n\n[[Speed of light|Light travels]] at about {{cvt|300,000,000|m/s}}, and [[speed of sound|sound]] travels through air at about {{cvt|343|m/s}}. An observer can approximate the distance to the strike by timing the interval between the visible lightning and the audible thunder it generates. A lightning flash preceding its thunder by one second would be approximately {{convert|343|m|abbr=on}} in distance; a delay of three seconds would indicate a distance of about {{cvt|1|km|disp=or}} (3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;343&nbsp;m). A flash preceding thunder by five seconds would indicate a distance of approximately {{cvt|1.5|km|disp=or}} (5&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;343&nbsp;m). Consequently, a lightning strike observed at a very close distance will be accompanied by a sudden clap of thunder, with almost no perceptible time lapse, possibly accompanied by the smell of [[ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>).\n\nLightning at a sufficient distance may be seen and not heard; there is data that a lightning storm can be seen at over {{cvt|100|mi|order=flip}} whereas the thunder travels about {{cvt|20|mi|order=flip}}. Anecdotally, there are many examples of people saying 'the storm was directly overhead or all-around and yet there was no thunder'.

Scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region. The laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as \"'''filaments'''\". Before the lightning strikes earth, the filaments lead electricity through the clouds, playing the role of lightning rods. Researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike. Nevertheless, a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered. According to the French and German scientists who ran the experiment, the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://infoniac.com/science/terawatt-laser-beam-shot-clouds-provokes-lightning-strike.html |title=Terawatt Laser Beam Shot in the Clouds Provokes Lightning Strike |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420130439/http://infoniac.com/science/terawatt-laser-beam-shot-clouds-provokes-lightning-strike.html |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} News report based on: {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1364/OE.16.005757 | pmid = 18542684 | title = Electric events synchronized with laser filaments in thunderclouds | journal = Optics Express | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 5757\u201363 | year = 2008 | last1 = Kasparian | first1 = J. | last2 = Ackermann | first2 = R. | last3 = Andr\u00e9 | first3 = Y.

Lightning causes [[thunder]], a sound from the [[shock wave]] which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during [[thunderstorm]]s and other types of energetic [[weather]] systems, but [[volcanic lightning]] can also occur during volcanic eruptions.\n\nThe three main kinds of lightning are distinguished by where they occur: either inside a single [[thundercloud]], between two different clouds, or between a cloud and the ground. Many other observational variants are recognized, including \"[[heat lightning]]\", which can be seen from a great distance but not heard; [[dry lightning]], which can cause [[forest fires]]; and [[ball lightning]], which is rarely observed scientifically.\n\nHumans have [[Lightning in religion|deified lightning]] for millennia, and lightning-inspired expressions like \"bolt from the blue\", \"to be struck by lightning\" (as to having an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] or [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]), \"lightning never strikes twice (in the same place)\" and \"[[blitzkrieg]]\" are in common usage. In some languages, the notion of \"love at first sight\" literally translates as \"lightning strike\".\n\n==Electrification==\n[[File:Understanding Lightning - Figure 1 - Cloud Charging Area.gif|thumb|(Figure 1) The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from {{convert|-15|to|-25|C|F}}.]]\n\nThe details of the charging process are still being studied by scientists, but there is general agreement on some of the basic concepts of thunderstorm electrification. The main charging area in a thunderstorm occurs in the central part of the storm where air is moving upward rapidly (updraft) and temperatures range from {{convert|-15|to|-25|C|F}}; see Figure 1. At that place, the combination of temperature and rapid upward air movement produces a mixture of super-cooled cloud droplets (small water droplets below freezing), small ice crystals, and [[graupel]] (soft hail). The updraft carries the super-cooled cloud droplets and very small ice crystals upward. At the same time, the graupel, which is considerably larger and denser, tends to fall or be suspended in the rising air.<ref name=\"NOAA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/science/science_electrication.htm |title=NWS Lightning Safety: Understanding Lightning: Thunderstorm Electrification |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=25 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130080723/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/science/science_electrication.htm |archivedate=November 30, 2016|df=mdy-all}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Graupel animation 3a.gif|thumb|left|(Figure 2) When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel, the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged.]]\n\nThe differences in the movement of the precipitation cause collisions to occur. When the rising ice crystals collide with graupel, the ice crystals become positively charged and the graupel becomes negatively charged; see Figure 2. The updraft carries the positively charged ice crystals upward toward the top of the storm cloud. The larger and denser graupel is either suspended in the middle of the thunderstorm cloud or falls toward the lower part of the storm.<ref name=\"NOAA\"/>\n\n[[File:Charged cloud animation 4a.gif|thumb|The upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged.]]\n\nThe result is that the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes positively charged while the middle to lower part of the thunderstorm cloud becomes negatively charged.<ref name=\"NOAA\"/>\n\nThe upward motions within the storm and winds at higher levels in the atmosphere tend to cause the small ice crystals (and positive charge) in the upper part of the thunderstorm cloud to spread out horizontally some distance from thunderstorm cloud base. This part of the thunderstorm cloud is called the anvil. While this is the main charging process for the thunderstorm cloud, some of these charges can be redistributed by air movements within the storm (updrafts and downdrafts). In addition, there is a small but important positive charge buildup near the bottom of the thunderstorm cloud due to the precipitation and warmer temperatures.<ref name=\"NOAA\"/>\n\n==General considerations==\n[[File:LightningCNP.ogg|thumb|left|Four-second video of a lightning strike, Island in the Sky, [[Canyonlands National Park]], [[Utah]], United States.]]\n\nA typical cloud-to-ground lightning flash culminates in the formation of an electrically conducting [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] channel through the air in excess of {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} tall, from within the cloud to the ground's surface.

These factors include ground elevation, [[latitude]], [[prevailing wind]] currents, [[relative humidity]], proximity to warm and cold bodies of water, etc. To a certain degree, the ratio between IC (in-cloud or intracloud), CC (cloud-to-cloud) and CG (cloud-to-ground) lightning may also vary by [[season]] in [[middle latitudes]].\n\nBecause human beings are terrestrial and most of their possessions are on the Earth where lightning can damage or destroy them, CG lightning is the most studied and best understood of the three types, even though IC and CC are more common types of lightning. Lightning's relative unpredictability limits a complete explanation of how or why it occurs, even after hundreds of years of scientific investigation.\nAbout 70% of lightning occurs over land in the [[tropics]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5oZUAAAAMAAJ&q=70%25+of+lightning+occurs+in+tropics+on+land&dq=70%25+of+lightning+occurs+in+tropics+on+land|title=Encyclopedia of atmospheric sciences|last=Holton|first=James R.|last2=Curry|first2=Judith A.|last3=Pyle|first3=J.

The flow of warm ocean currents past drier land masses, such as the [[Gulf stream|Gulf Stream]], partially explains the elevated frequency of lightning in the [[Southeast United States]]. Because large bodies of water lack the topographic variation that would result in atmospheric mixing, lightning is notably less frequent over the world's oceans than over land. The [[north pole|North]] and [[south pole|South Poles]] are limited in their coverage of thunderstorms and therefore result in areas with the least amount of lightning.{{Clarify|reason=absence of thunderstorms is similar to absence of lightning; an explanation of why are there less thunderstorms (lightning) above the poles would be more helpful|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn general, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flashes account for only 25% of all total lightning flashes worldwide. Since the base of a thunderstorm is usually negatively charged, this is where most CG lightning originates. This region is typically at the elevation where [[freezing level|freezing]] occurs within the cloud. Freezing, combined with collisions between ice and water, appears to be a critical part of the initial charge development and separation process. During wind-driven collisions, ice crystals tend to develop a positive charge, while a heavier, slushy mixture of ice and water (called [[graupel]]) develops a negative charge. Updrafts within a storm cloud separate the lighter ice crystals from the heavier graupel, causing the top region of the cloud to accumulate a positive [[space charge]] while the lower level accumulates a negative space charge.\n\n[[File:2013-08-07 04-23-26-foudre-belfort.jpg|thumb|Lightning in [[Belfort]], France]]\n\nBecause the concentrated charge within the cloud must exceed the insulating properties of air, and this increases proportionally to the distance between the cloud and the ground, the proportion of CG strikes (versus cloud-to-cloud (CC) or in-cloud (IC) discharges) becomes greater when the cloud is closer to the ground. In the tropics, where the freezing level is generally higher in the atmosphere, only 10% of lightning flashes are CG. At the latitude of Norway (around 60\u00b0 North latitude), where the freezing elevation is lower, 50% of lightning is CG.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast05dec_1/|date=December 5, 2001|title=Where LightningStrikes|publisher=NASA Science.

The atmosphere provides the electrical insulation, or barrier, that prevents free equalization between charged regions of opposite polarity.\n\nIt is well understood that during a thunderstorm there is charge separation and aggregation in certain regions of the cloud; however the exact processes by which this occurs are not fully understood.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1993)032<0642:AROTEP>2.0.CO;2|volume=32|title=A Review of Thunderstorm Electrification Processes |last1=Saunders|first1=C.

The induced positive surface charge, when measured against a fixed point, will be small as the thundercloud approaches, increasing as the center of the storm arrives and dropping as the thundercloud passes. The referential value of the induced surface charge could be roughly represented as a bell curve.\n\nThe oppositely charged regions create an [[electric field]] within the air between them. This electric field varies in relation to the strength of the surface charge on the base of the thundercloud \u2013 the greater the accumulated charge, the higher the electrical field.\n\n== Flashes and strikes ==\nThe best studied and understood form of lightning is cloud to ground (CG). Although more common, intracloud (IC) and cloud to cloud (CC) flashes are very difficult to study given there are no \"physical\" points to monitor inside the clouds. Also, given the very low probability lightning will strike the same point repeatedly and consistently, scientific inquiry is difficult at best even in the areas of high CG frequency. As such, knowing flash propagation is similar amongst all forms of lightning, the best means to describe the process is through an examination of the most studied form, cloud to ground.[[File:Desert Electric.jpg|thumb|A lightning strike from cloud to ground in the [[Mojave Desert]], California]] \n[[File:Florescent cloud blanket.jpg|thumb|An intracloud flash. A lightning flash within the cloud, illuminates the entire blanket.]]\n\n=== Lightning leaders ===\n[[File:Lightning formation.gif|thumb|Lightning formation|thumb|A downward leader travels towards earth, branching as it goes.]]\n[[File:Leaderlightnig.gif|thumbnail|Lightning strike caused by the connection of two leaders, positive shown in blue and negative in red]]\n\nIn a process not well understood, a bidirectional channel of [[ionized]] air, called a \"[[leader (spark)|leader]]\", is initiated between oppositely-charged regions in a thundercloud. Leaders are electrically conductive channels of ionized gas that propagate through, or are otherwise attracted to, regions with a charge opposite of that of the leader tip. The negative end of the bidirectional leader fills a positive charge region, also called a well, inside the cloud while the positive end fills a negative charge well. Leaders often split, forming branches in a tree-like pattern.<ref>Ultraslow-motion video of stepped leader propagation: [http://www.ztresearch.com/ ztresearch.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413125231/http://www.ztresearch.com/ |date=April 13, 2010 }}</ref> In addition, negative and some positive leaders travel in a discontinuous fashion, in a process called \"stepping\". The resulting jerky movement of the leaders can be readily observed in slow-motion videos of lightning flashes.\n\nIt is possible for one end of the leader to fill the oppositely-charged well entirely while the other end is still active. When this happens, the leader end which filled the well may propagate outside of the thundercloud and result in either a cloud-to-air flash or a cloud-to-ground flash. In a typical cloud-to-ground flash, a bidirectional leader initiates between the main negative and lower positive charge regions in a thundercloud. The weaker positive charge region is filled quickly by the negative leader which then propagates toward the inductively-charged ground.\n\nThe positively and negatively charged leaders proceed in opposite directions, positive upwards within the cloud and [[Electric charge|negative]] towards the earth. Both ionic channels proceed, in their respective directions, in a number of successive spurts. Each leader \"pools\" ions at the leading tips, shooting out one or more new leaders, momentarily pooling again to concentrate charged ions, then shooting out another leader. The negative leader continues to propagate and split as it heads downward, often speeding up as it gets closer to the Earth's surface.\n\nAbout 90% of ionic channel lengths between \"pools\" are approximately {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.<ref>Goulde, R.H. (1977) \"The lightning conductor\", pp. 545\u2013576 in ''Lightning Protection'', R.H. Golde, Ed., ''Lightning, Vol. 2'', Academic Press.</ref> The establishment of the ionic channel takes a comparatively long amount of time (hundreds of [[millisecond]]s) in comparison to the resulting discharge, which occurs within a few dozen microseconds. The [[electric current]] needed to establish the channel, measured in the tens or hundreds of [[ampere]]s, is dwarfed by subsequent currents during the actual discharge.\n\nInitiation of the lightning leaders is not well understood. The electric field strength within the thundercloud is not typically large enough to initiate this process by itself.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11214-008-9338-z|title=Charge Structure and Dynamics in Thunderstorms|date=2008|last1=Stolzenburg|first1=Maribeth|last2=Marshall|first2=Thomas C.|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=137|issue=1\u20134|page=355|bibcode = 2008SSRv..137..355S }}</ref> Many hypotheses have been proposed. One theory postulates that showers of relativistic electrons are created by [[cosmic rays]] and are then accelerated to higher velocities via a process called [[runaway breakdown]].

The electric field is strongest on grounded objects whose tops are closest to the base of the thundercloud, such as trees and tall buildings. If the electric field is strong enough, a positively charged ionic channel, called a positive or upward [[Streamer discharge|streamer]], can develop from these points. This was first theorized by Heinz Kasemir.<ref>Kasemir, H. W.

Photographs have been taken in which unattached streamers are clearly visible. The unattached downward leaders are also visible in branched lightning, none of which are connected to the earth, although it may appear they are. High-speed videos can show the attachment process in progress.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1002/2017GL072796|title = Lightning attachment process to common buildings|journal = Geophysical Research Letters|volume = 44|issue = 9|pages = 4368\u20134375|year = 2017|last1 = Saba|first1 = M.

Electrons accelerate rapidly as a result in a zone beginning at the point of attachment, which expands across the entire leader network at a fraction of the speed of light. This is the 'return stroke' and it is the most [[Luminous intensity|luminous]] and noticeable part of the lightning discharge.\n\nA large electric current flows along the plasma channel from the cloud to the ground, neutralising the positive ground charge as electrons flow away from the strike point to the surrounding area. This huge surge of current creates large radial voltage differences along the surface of the ground. Called step potentials, they are responsible for more injuries and deaths than the strike itself.<ref>See, for example, [https://www.livescience.com/55916-why-reindeer-killed-by-lightning.html here]</ref> Electricity takes every path available to it.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Path of Least Resistance|url=http://ecmweb.com/content/path-least-resistance|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104215214/http://ecmweb.com/content/path-least-resistance|archivedate=January 4, 2016|df=mdy-all|date=July 2001}}</ref>\nA portion of the return stroke current will often preferentially flow through one leg and out another, electrocuting an unlucky human or animal standing near the point where the lightning strikes.\n\nThe electric current of the return stroke averages 30 kiloamperes for a typical negative CG flash, often referred to as \"negative CG\" lightning. In some cases, a ground to cloud (GC) lightning flash may originate from a positively charged region on the ground below a storm. These discharges normally originate from the tops of very tall structures, such as communications antennas. The rate at which the return stroke current travels has been found to be around 100,000&nbsp;km/s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Idone | first1 = V. P. | last2 = Orville | first2 = R.

The core temperature of the plasma during the return stroke may exceed 50,000 K, causing it to brilliantly radiate with a blue-white color. Once the electric current stops flowing, the channel cools and dissipates over tens or hundreds of milliseconds, often disappearing as fragmented patches of glowing gas. The nearly instantaneous heating during the return stroke causes the air to expand explosively, producing a powerful [[shock wave]] which is heard as [[#Thunder|thunder]].\n\n====Re-strike====\nHigh-speed videos (examined frame-by-frame) show that most negative CG lightning flashes are made up of 3 or 4 individual strokes, though there may be as many as 30.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 5, p. 41.</ref>\n\nEach re-strike is separated by a relatively large amount of time, typically 40 to 50 milliseconds, as other charged regions in the cloud are discharged in subsequent strokes. Re-strikes often cause a noticeable \"[[strobe light]]\" effect.<ref name=\"uman\">[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] pp. 103\u2013110.</ref>\n\nTo understand why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel, one needs to understand the behavior of positive leaders, which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader's connection with the ground. Positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do. For reasons not well understood, bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on the tips of the decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network. These leaders, also called ''recoil leaders'', usually decay shortly after their formation. When they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network, a return stroke-like process occurs and a ''dart leader'' travels across all or a portion of the length of the original leader. The dart leaders making connections with the ground are what cause a majority of subsequent return strokes.<ref name=\"Warner\">{{cite web |url=https://ztresearch.blog/education/ground-flashes/ |title=Ground Flashes |last=Warner |first=Tom |website=ZT Research |access-date=2017-11-09|date=2017-05-06 }}</ref>\n\nEach successive stroke is preceded by intermediate dart leader strokes that have a faster rise time but lower amplitude than the initial return stroke. Each subsequent stroke usually re-uses the discharge channel taken by the previous one, but the channel may be offset from its previous position as wind displaces the hot channel.<ref>[[#Uman|Uman (1986)]] Ch. 9, p. 78.</ref>\n\nSince recoil and dart leader processes do not occur on negative leaders, subsequent return strokes very seldom utilize the same channel on positive ground flashes which are explained later in the article.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\n====Transient currents during flash====\nThe electric current within a typical negative CG lightning discharge rises very quickly to its peak value in 1\u201310 microseconds, then decays more slowly over 50\u2013200 microseconds. The transient nature of the current within a lightning flash results in several phenomena that need to be addressed in the effective protection of ground-based structures. Rapidly changing currents tend to travel on the surface of a conductor, in what is called the [[skin effect]], unlike direct currents, which \"flow-through\" the entire conductor like water through a hose. Hence, conductors used in the protection of facilities tend to be multi-stranded, with small wires woven together. This increases the total bundle [[surface area]] in inverse proportion to the individual strand radius, for a fixed total [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]].\n\nThe rapidly changing currents also create [[Electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulses (EMPs)]] that radiate outward from the ionic channel. This is a characteristic of all electrical discharges. The radiated pulses rapidly weaken as their distance from the origin increases. However, if they pass over conductive elements such as power lines, communication lines, or metallic pipes, they may induce a current which travels outward to its termination. The surge current is inversely related to the Surge impedance ... so the higher in impedance, then the lower the current.<ref>[http://sites.ieee.org/sas-pesias/files/2016/03/Lightning-Protection-and-Transient-Overvoltage_Rogerio-Verdolin.pdf Lightning Protection and Transient Overvoltage | VERDOLIN SOLUTIONS INC. | HIGH VOLTAGE POWER ENGINEERING SERVICES]</ref> This is the \"[[Voltage spike|surge]]\" that, more often than not, results in the destruction of delicate [[electronics]], [[electrical appliance]]s, or [[electric motor]]s. Devices known as [[Surge protector|surge protectors (SPD) or transient voltage surge suppressors (TVSS)]] attached in parallel with these lines can detect the lightning flash's transient irregular current, and, through alteration of its physical properties, route the spike to an attached [[Electrical ground|earthing ground]], thereby protecting the equipment from damage.\n\n== Types ==\nThere are three primary types of lightning, defined by what is at the \"ends\" of a flash channel.\n*Intracloud (IC), which occurs within a single thundercloud unit\n*Cloud to cloud (CC) or intercloud, which starts and ends between two different \"functional\" thundercloud units\n*Cloud to ground (CG), that primarily originates in the thundercloud and terminates on an Earth surface, but may also occur in the reverse direction, that is ground to cloud \nThere are variations of each type, such as \"positive\" versus \"negative\" CG flashes, that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured. Different [[common name]]s used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or different events.\n\n=== Cloud to ground (CG) ===\n[[File:Lightning strikes mountain top.jpg|thumb|right|''Cloud to ground'' lightning]]\nCloud-to-ground (CG) lightning is a lightning discharge between a thundercloud and the ground. It is initiated by a stepped leader moving down from the cloud, which is met by a streamer moving up from the ground.\n\nCG is the least common, but best understood of all types of lightning.  It is easier to study scientifically, because it terminates on a physical object, namely the Earth, and lends itself to being measured by instruments on the ground. Of the three primary types of lightning, it poses the greatest threat to life and property since it terminates or \"strikes\" the Earth. \nThe overall discharge, termed a flash, is composed of a number of processes such as preliminary breakdown, stepped leaders, connecting leaders, return strokes, dart leaders and subsequent return strokes.<ref>V.

Most CG lightning is negative, meaning that a negative charge is transferred to ground and electrons travel downward along the lightning channel. The reverse happens in a positive CG flash, where electrons travel upward along the lightning channel and a positive charge is transferred to the ground. Positive lightning is less common than negative lightning, and on average makes up less than 5% of all lightning strikes.<ref>{{cite web | title = NWS JetStream \u2013 The Positive and Negative Side of Lightning | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/lightning/positive.htm | accessdate = September 25, 2007 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070705205815/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/lightning/positive.htm | archivedate = July 5, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anvil-to-ground lightning.jpg|thumb|A ''bolt from the blue'' lightning strike which appears to initiate from the clear, but turbulent sky above the [[anvil cloud]] and drive a bolt of plasma through the cloud directly to the ground.

Despite the popular misconception that these are positive lightning strikes due to them seemingly originating from the positive charge region, observations have shown that these are in fact negative flashes. They begin as intracloud flashes within the cloud, the negative leader then exits the cloud from the positive charge region before propagating through clear air and striking the ground some distance away.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2011JD016890|title=Lightning morphology and impulse charge moment change of high peak current negative strokes|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|volume=117|issue=D4|pages=n/a|year=2012|last1=Lu|first1=Gaopeng|last2=Cummer|first2=Steven A|last3=Blakeslee|first3=Richard J|last4=Weiss|first4=Stephanie|last5=Beasley|first5=William H|bibcode=2012JGRD..117.4212L|citeseerx=10.1.1.308.9842}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ngeo162|title=Upward electrical discharges from&nbsp;thunderstorms|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=1|issue=4|page=233|year=2008|last1=Krehbiel|first1=Paul R|last2=Riousset|first2=Jeremy A|last3=Pasko|first3=Victor P|last4=Thomas|first4=Ronald J|last5=Rison|first5=William|last6=Stanley|first6=Mark A|last7=Edens|first7=Harald E|bibcode=2008NatGe...1..233K|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1b58b38d0dc7adcd22afefcf6eca9173ad46f3fe}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Cloud to cloud}} Cloud to cloud (CC) and intra-cloud (IC) ===\n[[File:Ligtning new delhi view 1.GIF|thumb|Branching of cloud to cloud lightning, [[New Delhi]], India]]\n[[File:Cloud to cloud lightning strike.jpg|thumb|Multiple paths of cloud-to-cloud lightning, [[Swifts Creek, Victoria|Swifts Creek]], Australia.]]\n[[File:Cloud to cloud lightning strike nov08.jpg|thumb|Cloud-to-cloud lightning, [[Victoria, Australia]].]]\n[[File:Lightningcloudtocloud.png|thumb|Cloud-to-cloud lightning seen in [[Gresham, Oregon]].]]\n\nLightning discharges may occur between areas of cloud without contacting the ground. When it occurs between two separate clouds it is known as ''inter-cloud lightning'', and when it occurs between areas of differing [[electric potential]] within a single cloud it is known as ''intra-cloud lightning''. Intra-cloud lightning is the most frequently occurring type.<ref name=\"GHCC primer2\" />\n\nIntra-cloud lightning most commonly occurs between the upper [[cumulonimbus incus|anvil]] portion and lower reaches of a given thunderstorm. This lightning can sometimes be observed at great distances at night as so-called \"[[sheet lightning]]\". In such instances, the observer may see only a flash of light without hearing any thunder.\n\n [[File:Anvil Crawler over Lake Wright Patman south of Redwater, Texas..JPG|thumb|Anvil Crawler over Lake Wright Patman south of Redwater, Texas on the backside of a large area of rain associated with a cold-front]]\nAnother term used for cloud\u2013cloud or cloud\u2013cloud\u2013ground lightning is \"Anvil Crawler\", due to the habit of charge, typically originating beneath or within the anvil and scrambling through the upper cloud layers of a thunderstorm, often generating dramatic multiple branch strokes. These are usually seen as a thunderstorm passes over the observer or begins to decay. The most vivid crawler behavior occurs in well developed thunderstorms that feature extensive rear anvil shearing.\n\n=== Observational variations ===\n* '''Anvil crawler lightning''', sometimes called '''Spider lightning''' is created when leaders propagate through horizontally-extensive charge regions in mature thunderstorms, usually the stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems. These discharges usually begin as intracloud discharges originating within the convective region; the negative leader end then propagates well into the aforementioned charge regions in the stratiform area. If the leader becomes too long, it may separate into multiple bidirectional leaders. When this happens, the positive end of the separated leader may strike the ground as a positive CG flash or crawl on the underside of the cloud, creating a spectacular display of lightning crawling across the sky. Ground flashes produced in this manner tend to transfer high amounts of charge, and this can trigger upward lightning flashes and upper-atmospheric lightning.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n*'''[[Ball lightning]]''' may be an [[atmospheric electricity|atmospheric electrical]] phenomenon, the physical nature of which is still [[controversial]].

Since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but along the length of the lightning's path, the sound origin's varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect. Perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel, by [[echo (phenomenon)|acoustic echoing]] from terrain, and by the usually multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike.\n\n[[Speed of light|Light travels]] at about {{cvt|300,000,000|m/s}}, and [[speed of sound|sound]] travels through air at about {{cvt|343|m/s}}. An observer can approximate the distance to the strike by timing the interval between the visible lightning and the audible thunder it generates. A lightning flash preceding its thunder by one second would be approximately {{convert|343|m|abbr=on}} in distance; a delay of three seconds would indicate a distance of about {{cvt|1|km|disp=or}} (3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;343&nbsp;m).

Scientists fired ultra-fast pulses from an extremely powerful laser thus sending several terawatts into the clouds to call down electrical discharges in storm clouds over the region. The laser beams sent from the laser make channels of ionized molecules known as \"'''filaments'''\". Before the lightning strikes earth, the filaments lead electricity through the clouds, playing the role of lightning rods. Researchers generated filaments that lived a period too short to trigger a real lightning strike. Nevertheless, a boost in electrical activity within the clouds was registered. According to the French and German scientists who ran the experiment, the fast pulses sent from the laser will be able to provoke lightning strikes on demand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://infoniac.com/science/terawatt-laser-beam-shot-clouds-provokes-lightning-strike.html |title=Terawatt Laser Beam Shot in the Clouds Provokes Lightning Strike |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420130439/http://infoniac.com/science/terawatt-laser-beam-shot-clouds-provokes-lightning-strike.html |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} News report based on: {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1364/OE.16.005757 | pmid = 18542684 | title = Electric events synchronized with laser filaments in thunderclouds | journal = Optics Express | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 5757\u201363 | year = 2008 | last1 = Kasparian | first1 = J. | last2 = Ackermann | first2 = R. | last3 = Andr\u00e9 | first3 = Y.

The intense currents of a lightning discharge create a fleeting but very strong magnetic field. Where the lightning current path passes through rock, soil, or metal these materials can become permanently magnetized. This effect is known as lightning-induced [[Remanence|remanent]] magnetism, or LIRM. These currents follow the least resistive path, often horizontally near the surface<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Re-magnetization of a Surface Outcrop by Lightning Currents|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.1961.tb02963.x|date=1961|last1=Graham|first1=K.W.T.|journal=[[Geophysical Journal International]]|volume=6|issue=1|page=85|bibcode = 1961GeoJ....6...85G }}</ref><ref>Cox A.

The film stars husband and wife actors [[Patrick J. Adams]] and [[Troian Bellisario]], playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, respectively, searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in [[Toronto]]. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescope. This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses.\n\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \u201csee it\u201d.\n\nA fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \u201csee it\u201d - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara.\n\nA few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message&mdash;\u201cIsaac Bruno\u201d. He is present when the next message arrives &ndash; an audio file of a [[Bob Dylan]] song that he and Clara often listened to together. The film ends with Isaac smiling through his tears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick J.

Produced by Ted Koplar through his production company [[World Events Productions]], Voltron was an adaptation of several Japanese [[anime]] television series from [[Toei Animation]]. The original television series aired in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] from September 10, 1984 to November 18, 1985. The first season of ''Voltron'', featuring the \"Lion Force Voltron\", was adapted from the series ''[[Beast King GoLion]]''. The second season, featuring the \"Vehicle Team Voltron\", was adapted from the unrelated series ''[[Armored Fleet Dairugger XV]]''.\n\n''[[Voltron (1984 TV series)|Voltron: Defender of the Universe]]'' was the top-rated syndicated children's show for two years during its original run,<ref name=\"keefe-obit\">{{cite news|last=Koppel|first=Niko|title=Peter Keefe, Creator of Cartoon \u2018Voltron,\u2019 Dies at 57|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/arts/design/11keefe.html?ref=obituaries|accessdate=11 June 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=10 June 2010}}</ref> and it spawned three follow-up series, several comic books, and a line of toys.  \n\n==Variations==\n\n==<sub>VOLTRON FORCE LEGENDARY DEFENDER OF THE UNIVERSE</sub> ==\nThe paladans of Voltron are swimming in the castles pool while Keith was testing his fighting skills as he usually do. Hunk asked why does Keith never hang out with us then Lance says maybe he thinks his better than all of us because his the leader of Voltron then Glafis was Keith's  father's advisor telling them why he always hates getting close to people because when Keith was 7 years old his father died and Keith still thinking it's Keith's fault for his own father's death and telling them how he died by Keith not listening to his father Keith ran into the forest while his father told him not to go but Keith never listened his father noticed Keith was not playing in front of their house so his father went looking for him. Keith was hanging on a branch trying to get out of the river the Keith's father trying to save him but by trying to save Keith his father fell into the river and fell down the waterfall. So everyone now knows why Keith doesn't get close to anyone and always pushing them away before they leave him. There was a emergency report from a space ship out of no where the paladans inform Keith and they fly there lions infront of the ship with them getting inside ghosts appear and seem to know Keith telling him his birth name is Yurak Keith not wanting to believe it until he sees his father and remembering his father's name ColtKeith telling him on the 11 of November a boy was born and his name was Yurak by telling him Keith was that boy the boy talked by the prophecy with Allura being surprised realises that it could be Keith the prince of destruction now knowing Keith is Yurak and is the prince of destruction Voltron knows someday Keith would be King and Hunk bows down before him Keith not wanting to be the prince of destruction saying no I wont be King and im not prince Yurak now knowing and hearing Keith say the space ship vanishes while they in it and flying back to the Castle of lions and telling Caran and Glafis being surprised but still Keith says no he'll not be King and is not Yurak.\n\nOne year past and Keith still not wanting to be King. King Alfor came to Keith telling him he should be King but Keith still refuses. The next day some stranger looking for Yurak came to Voltron and they said they know who Yurak is and wanting to know why the stranger tell them his name is Namek and he needs Yuraks help. The paladans picking who will tell Keith plays rock paper scissors and allura loses by paper so Allura had to tell Keith. She went to tell him and him telling her no but she asked him again with Keith being soft towards her agreed but he said only this one time so Keith went and Namek asked where is Yurak but Keith said im here and Namek seeing he is only 19 years old his still a teenager wondering if he is thoroughly the Yurak from the prophecy Keith saying no but the others saying yes he is Prince Yurak Namek told Keith he is his advisor and staying by them to learn Keith his rules. Allura asking Keith why he agreed to her and he says he would have agreed to anyone Allura knowing that's not true proposed to him and he agreed but on one condition she would be Queen and chief in commander of Voltron she agreed and with them telling Voltron with the other planets they are going to become King and Queen. A few months Keith and Allura got two kids the one was a boy named Kion and the other a girl named Kiara someday being part of Voltron and King or Queen.\n==''Vehicle Team Voltron'' (Voltron of the Near Universe; Voltron I)==\n\n{{Main|Vehicle Voltron}}\n\nThe second series was primarily edited from ''[[Armored Fleet Dairugger XV]]'' ({{lang|ja-Latn|Kik\u014d Kantai Dairugger XV}}), with the storyline considerably changed.

Produced by Ted Koplar through his production company [[World Events Productions]], Voltron was an adaptation of several Japanese [[anime]] television series from [[Toei Animation]]. The original television series aired in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] from September 10, 1984 to November 18, 1985. The first season of ''Voltron'', featuring the \"Lion Force Voltron\", was adapted from the series ''[[Beast King GoLion]]''. The second season, featuring the \"Vehicle Team Voltron\", was adapted from the unrelated series ''[[Armored Fleet Dairugger XV]]''.\n\n''[[Voltron (1984 TV series)|Voltron: Defender of the Universe]]'' was the top-rated syndicated children's show for two years during its original run,<ref name=\"keefe-obit\">{{cite news|last=Koppel|first=Niko|title=Peter Keefe, Creator of Cartoon \u2018Voltron,\u2019 Dies at 57|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/arts/design/11keefe.html?ref=obituaries|accessdate=11 June 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=10 June 2010}}</ref> and it spawned three follow-up series, several comic books, and a line of toys.  \n\n==Variations==\n\n==<sub>VOLTRON FORCE LEGENDARY DEFENDER OF THE UNIVERSE</sub> ==\nThe paladans of Voltron are swimming in the castles pool while Keith was testing his fighting skills as he usually do. Hunk asked why does Keith never hang out with us then Lance says maybe he thinks his better than all of us because his the leader of Voltron then Glafis was Keith's  father's advisor telling them why he always hates getting close to people because when Keith was 7 years old his father died and Keith still thinking it's Keith's fault for his own father's death and telling them how he died by Keith not listening to his father Keith ran into the forest while his father told him not to go but Keith never listened his father noticed Keith was not playing in front of their house so his father went looking for him. Keith was hanging on a branch trying to get out of the river the Keith's father trying to save him but by trying to save Keith his father fell into the river and fell down the waterfall. So everyone now knows why Keith doesn't get close to anyone and always pushing them away before they leave him. There was a emergency report from a space ship out of no where the paladans inform Keith and they fly there lions infront of the ship with them getting inside ghosts appear and seem to know Keith telling him his birth name is Yurak Keith not wanting to believe it until he sees his father and remembering his father's name ColtKeith telling him on the 11 of November a boy was born and his name was Yurak by telling him Keith was that boy the boy talked by the prophecy with Allura being surprised realises that it could be Keith the prince of destruction now knowing Keith is Yurak and is the prince of destruction Voltron knows someday Keith would be King and Hunk bows down before him Keith not wanting to be the prince of destruction saying no I wont be King and im not prince Yurak now knowing and hearing Keith say the space ship vanishes while they in it and flying back to the Castle of lions and telling Caran and Glafis being surprised but still Keith says no he'll not be King and is not Yurak.\n\nOne year past and Keith still not wanting to be King. King Alfor came to Keith telling him he should be King but Keith still refuses. The next day some stranger looking for Yurak came to Voltron and they said they know who Yurak is and wanting to know why the stranger tell them his name is Namek and he needs Yuraks help. The paladans picking who will tell Keith plays rock paper scissors and allura loses by paper so Allura had to tell Keith. She went to tell him and him telling her no but she asked him again with Keith being soft towards her agreed but he said only this one time so Keith went and Namek asked where is Yurak but Keith said im here and Namek seeing he is only 19 years old his still a teenager wondering if he is thoroughly the Yurak from the prophecy Keith saying no but the others saying yes he is Prince Yurak Namek told Keith he is his advisor and staying by them to learn Keith his rules. Allura asking Keith why he agreed to her and he says he would have agreed to anyone Allura knowing that's not true proposed to him and he agreed but on one condition she would be Queen and chief in commander of Voltron she agreed and with them telling Voltron with the other planets they are going to become King and Queen. A few months Keith and Allura got two kids the one was a boy named Kion and the other a girl named Kiara someday being part of Voltron and King or Queen.\n==''Vehicle Team Voltron'' (Voltron of the Near Universe; Voltron I)==\n\n{{Main|Vehicle Voltron}}\n\nThe second series was primarily edited from ''[[Armored Fleet Dairugger XV]]'' ({{lang|ja-Latn|Kik\u014d Kantai Dairugger XV}}), with the storyline considerably changed.
