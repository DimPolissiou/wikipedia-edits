{"title_page": "Deaths in 2020", "text_new": "{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Short description|List of notable individuals who died in 2020}}\nThe following deaths of notable individuals occurred in 2020. Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===10===\n\n===9===\n\n===8===\n*{{ill|Andrzej Adamiak|pl}}, 60, Polish bass guitarist, singer and songwriter.<ref>[https://kultura.onet.pl/muzyka/wiadomosci/andrzej-adamiak-nie-zyje-lider-zespolu-rezerwat-mial-60-lat/c7v72xk Nie \u017cyje Andrzej Adamiak.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===10===\n\n===9===\n\n===8===\n*{{ill|Andrzej Adamiak|pl}}, 60, Polish bass guitarist, singer and songwriter.<ref>[https://kultura.onet.pl/muzyka/wiadomosci/andrzej-adamiak-nie-zyje-lider-zespolu-rezerwat-mial-60-lat/c7v72xk Nie \u017cyje Andrzej Adamiak.

When 19th-century travelers referred to [[Constantinople]] (today, [[Istanbul]]) as the ''Paris of the East'', they were mentioning the Grande Rue de P\u00e9ra (\u0130stiklal Caddesi) and its half-European, half-Asian culture.

Kottayam is located in the basin of the [[Meenachil River]] at an average elevation of {{convert|3|m}} above sea level, and has a moderate climate. It is located 150 kilometres (93 mi) north of state capital [[Thiruvananthapuram]].\n\nThe city is known for its trade in natural rubber, and the national [[Rubber Board]] is headquartered in the city, as is the Plantation Corporation of Kerala. [[Kottayam Port]] is India's first multi-modal inland container depot. The headquarters of the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], called the Catholicate Aramana (Catholicate palace), is situated at nearby Devalokam.{{citation needed lead|date=January 2020}}\n\nKottayam is home to one of the first English schools in India, and is a leader in literacy, known as '''Akshara Nagari''' (English: land of letters). Many of the first [[Malayalam]] daily newspapers, like ''[[Deepika (newspaper)|Deepika]]'', ''[[Malayala Manorama]]'', and ''[[Mangalam Publications|Mangalam]]'', were started and are headquartered in Kottayam, as a number of publishing houses.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe royal house of the [[Thekkumkur]] ruler was protected by a fort called Thaliyilkotta. It is believed that the name ''Kottayam'' is derived from a combination of the [[Malayalam]] words ''kotta'' which means \"fort\" (Thalitilkotta) and ''akam'' which means \"inside\". The combined form, Kottaykkakam (\u0d15\u0d4b\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d2f\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d15\u0d02), can be translated as \"inside the fort\".<ref name=\"Kurien\">{{cite journal| author=Kurien L |url=http://ietd.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/354/2/11_chapter4.pdf |title=Structure and functioning of Gramsabhas |year=2010 |accessdate= }}</ref><ref name=\"Kottayam is a compound word- kotta+akam which means the interior of a fort.

Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the [[Venad|Kulashekara Empire]] (800\u20131102&nbsp;AD). By about 1100, the Kingdom of Vempolinad had split into the Kingdoms of Thekkumkur and [[Vadakkumkur]], and the latter became a vassal of [[Kochi|Cochin]].\n\nThe royal house had originally beeb situated in Vennimala in Kottayam. It was protected by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and, as a result, the locality came to be known by the same name as the fort. Afterwards, Thekkumkur kings shifted their capital to Nattassery near Kumaranallore at the outskirts of Kottayam town. It is believed that the Thekkumkur dynasty ruled Kottayam from Thazhathangadi.\n\nThe [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] and the [[Dutch India|Dutch]] established trade relations with both of these kingdoms, dealing in black pepper and other spices. After the subjugation of the Dutch East India Company by the Kingdom of [[Travancore]] in 1742, military operations of [[Marthanda Varma]] progressed against the northern neighbouring kingdoms, including Thekkumkur.\n\nThough Thekkumkur allied with Chempakassery and Vadakkumkoor to protect the kingdom, all of them were finally annexed to Travancore.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

After the fall of Ambalapuzha, and as the ruler of Thekkumkur refused to come to terms with Travancore, his capital city was taken on 11 September 1750 by [[Ramayyan Dalawa]], the general and prime minister of Marthanda Varma, and the state was annexed to Travancore in 1753.\n\nKottayam then became a part of the Princely State of Travancore.\n\n===Travancore Rule===\nThere existed no institution in the princely state of [[Travancore]] before the 1800s. In 1817, the [[Church Missionary Society]] of England established [[CMS College Kottayam|CMS College]] as the first college in India.

The Malayali Memorial agitation of 1891 may be said to have had its origin in Kottayam. This document, presented to the Maharaja Sri Moolam Thirunal, sought to secure better representation for educated Travancoreans in the civil service, and was drafted at a public meeting in the Kottayam public library.

It is located 150 kilometres (93 mi) north of state capital [[Thiruvananthapuram]].\n\nThe city is known for its trade in natural rubber, and the national [[Rubber Board]] is headquartered in the city, as is the Plantation Corporation of Kerala. [[Kottayam Port]] is India's first multi-modal inland container depot. The headquarters of the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], called the Catholicate Aramana (Catholicate palace), is situated at nearby Devalokam.{{citation needed lead|date=January 2020}}\n\nKottayam is home to one of the first English schools in India, and is a leader in literacy, known as '''Akshara Nagari''' (English: land of letters). Many of the first [[Malayalam]] daily newspapers, like ''[[Deepika (newspaper)|Deepika]]'', ''[[Malayala Manorama]]'', and ''[[Mangalam Publications|Mangalam]]'', were started and are headquartered in Kottayam, as a number of publishing houses.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe royal house of the [[Thekkumkur]] ruler was protected by a fort called Thaliyilkotta.

Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the [[Venad|Kulashekara Empire]] (800\u20131102&nbsp;AD). By about 1100, the Kingdom of Vempolinad had split into the Kingdoms of Thekkumkur and [[Vadakkumkur]], and the latter became a vassal of [[Kochi|Cochin]].\n\nThe royal house had originally beeb situated in Vennimala in Kottayam. It was protected by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and, as a result, the locality came to be known by the same name as the fort. Afterwards, Thekkumkur kings shifted their capital to Nattassery near Kumaranallore at the outskirts of Kottayam town. It is believed that the Thekkumkur dynasty ruled Kottayam from Thazhathangadi.\n\nThe [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] and the [[Dutch India|Dutch]] established trade relations with both of these kingdoms, dealing in black pepper and other spices. After the subjugation of the Dutch East India Company by the Kingdom of [[Travancore]] in 1742, military operations of [[Marthanda Varma]] progressed against the northern neighbouring kingdoms, including Thekkumkur.\n\nThough Thekkumkur allied with Chempakassery and Vadakkumkoor to protect the kingdom, all of them were finally annexed to Travancore.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

After the fall of Ambalapuzha, and as the ruler of Thekkumkur refused to come to terms with Travancore, his capital city was taken on 11 September 1750 by [[Ramayyan Dalawa]], the general and prime minister of Marthanda Varma, and the state was annexed to Travancore in 1753.\n\nKottayam then became a part of the Princely State of Travancore.\n\n===Travancore Rule===\nThere existed no institution in the princely state of [[Travancore]] before the 1800s. In 1817, the [[Church Missionary Society]] of England established [[CMS College Kottayam|CMS College]] as the first college in India. It was welcomed by the government to provide administrators for the public bureaucracy<ref name=\"cms\"/>\n[[File:Gandhi at vaikom satyagraha-2.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] at [[Vaikom Satyagraha]]|115px|left]]\n\nKottayam had a role in all the modern political agitations. The Malayali Memorial agitation of 1891 may be said to have had its origin in Kottayam. This document, presented to the Maharaja Sri Moolam Thirunal, sought to secure better representation for educated Travancoreans in the civil service, and was drafted at a public meeting in the Kottayam public library. The event marked the beginning of the modern political movement in the state.<ref name=\"Kurien\"/><ref name=\"Malayali Memorial\">[http://kottayam.nic.in/# Malayali Memorial is the movement that is said to be originated in Kottayam]</ref> The people of Kottayam also played a major role during the Abstention Movement in the 1930s, which advocated for the representation of Hindus of the [[Caste system in India|lower castes]] in the Travancore Legislature.<ref name=\"Kurien\"/> The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924 against [[untouchability]], led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], took place in [[Vaikom]] near Kottayam.<ref name=\"Kurien\"/>\n\n===Post-independence===\nKottayam became a revenue division of Travancore.<ref name=\"Kurien\" /> A fifth division, [[Devikulam]], existed for a short period but was later added to Kottayam.

The vegetation is mainly tropical evergreen and moist deciduous.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate in this district is moderate and pleasant. Kottayam's proximity to the [[equator]] results in little seasonal temperature variation, with moderate to high levels of [[humidity]].

{"title_page": "MoviePlus", "text_new": "{{Infobox Software\n| name = Serif MoviePlus\n| logo=\n| screenshot = MoviePlusX5.jpg\n| screenshot size = 350px\n| caption = MoviePlus X5\n| developer = [[Serif Europe|Serif]]\n| latest_release_version = X6\n| latest_release_date = {{Start date and age|2012|03|05}}\n| operating_system = [[Microsoft Windows]]\n| genre = [[Video editing software]]\n| license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]]\n| website = {{URL|www.serif.com/movieplus}}\n|released={{Start date and age|2003}}|discontinued=yes<ref>{{cite web|title=MoviePlus has been discontinued|url=http://www.serif.com/movieplus/|website=Serif|publisher=Serif Europe Ltd.|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref>}}\n'''Serif MoviePlus''' was a [[non-linear video editor]] created by [[Serif Europe]] that allowed both professional and home users to edit digital video and digital images.\n\nThis software is no longer supported, as Serif are concentrating on their Affinity range.\n\nMoviePlus was affordable and popular with home and semi-professional filmmakers. It can be used to edit material from [[FireWire]]-attached MiniDV video from a consumer digital video camera, professional DV camera or HDV camera. The software captures video onto the computer's hard drive, where it can be edited and processed. The result can be recorded on MiniDV tape, converted into a format suitable for replaying on a PC, converted into a format suitable for [[uploading]] to a [[web site]], or burning onto a DVD. The current version of MoviePlus X6 requires a minimum of an [[Intel]] [[Pentium 4]] [[Hyper-Threading]] processor or [[AMD]] [[Athlon XP]] processor and 1 GB of RAM.\n\n== History ==\nFrom the early 2000s (decade), MoviePlus has developed an enthusiastic user base. Originally, it was designed largely for editing video from [[MiniDV]] [[camcorders]], largely to produce [[DVDs]].\n\n* MoviePlus 1 (2003)\n* MoviePlus 4 (March 2004)\n* MoviePlus 5 (March 2006)\n* MoviePlus X3 (August 2008)\n* MoviePlus X5 (February 2011)\n* MoviePlus X6 (March 2012, current version)(no longer supported)\n\n== Features ==\nMoviePlus provides non-linear, [[non-destructive editing]] of any compatible video format. It supports unlimited simultaneously composited video tracks; unlimited audio tracks; as well as standard [[ripple edit|ripple]], [[roll edit|roll]], [[slip edit|slip]], [[slide edit|slide]], scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions. It comes with a range of dissolve, iris, distortion and basic 3D transitions and a range of [[filter (video)|video filters]].\n\nMoviePlus, like all current NLE systems also has the ability to up-convert standard definition material to high definition as well as the ability to cross-convert video of differing frame rates. Like many similar products, all rendering is performed in software rather than in hardware: Rendering is a slow process, even on a fast computer.\n\n== Interface ==\nMoviePlus X6 is based around the [[Timeline]], which can accommodate multiple Overlay, Music, video and audio tracks, either singly or organized into groups. Video and audio sources and images can be organized in a Media Panel and then [[dragged]] onto the appropriate part of the [[Timeline]]. Using an in-built [[file browser]], they can also be [[dragged]] direct from any [[Disk storage|disk]] location.\n\nOnce on the [[timeline]], the tools in MoviePlus can be used to [[non-destructively]] edit, manipulate and re-arrange these source. All actions can be previewed using the Video Preview screen. The Properties panel displays detailed information about any selected source and permits detailed adjustments. There are two audio level indicators for the left and right audio channels. The positions and sizes of these panel can be changed and while using multiple computer monitors, the different panels can be moved onto different monitors.\n\nMoviePlus has a shuttle interface (for variable-speed scanning through a clip, forwards or backwards) and a jogging interface (for frame-by-frame advancing).\n\nMoviePlus X3 added a storyboard mode which simplifies editing for linear projects and cleaner and simpler interface.\n\n== Project Files ==\nLike similar digital non-linear editing applications, MoviePlus does not actually alter the media sources; it builds a small \"project file\" which contains links to all media sources used, together with details of virtual edits, transitions, special effects and titling.\n\nNote: The project file contains only links to the locations of the sources; it does not contain the actual sources.\n\nWhen the completed movie is [[exported]], MoviePlus uses this project file to build, [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]] and [[Code|encode]] the movie. If a media source has been moved to a different location on the hard disk, MoviePlus issues a warning and allows the operator to find the new location or to remove the source from that movie. If several media sources have been moved to similar new locations, MoviePlus can quickly re-connect with the whole group.\n\n== Key Frames ==\nEffects and envelopes are introduced by placing special \"Key Frames\" on a track of the [[timeline]]. Each of these key frames holds information about the \"effect\" to be applied at that instant to a particular media source. For example: The opacity, colour or zoom of a video source; the volume or pan of an audio source; the pan, zoom, rotation of an image.<ref>[http://www.itreviews.co.uk/software/s376.htm MoviePlus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924053626/http://www.itreviews.co.uk/software/s376.htm |date=2006-09-24 }}, ITReviews.co.uk, retrieved July 2010</ref> Key-framed changes can be applied at the source, track, or group level.\n\n== Computer Generated Sources ==\nMoviePlus provides computer generated sources for coloured backgrounds, shapes and masks, and text in a variety of styles. These can be adjusted and dragged to the timeline.\n\n== Advanced editing and Blending modes ==\nMoviePlus supports an unlimited number of Overlay, Music, video and audio tracks, as well as Video tracks groups for linking elements together. Blending modes like the ones in [[Adobe Photoshop]] are also possible, enabling advanced blending with Overlay or Multiply effects that are generally not common on entry-level packages.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of video editing software]]\n*[[Comparison of video editing software]]\n\n=== References ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20161116033321/http://www.serif.com/MoviePlus/ Serif MoviePlusX6 (page from Internet Archive as original deleted)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120205114809/http://www.serif.com/community/pdfs/MoviePlus5.pdf Serif: MoviePlus 5 User Manual]([[PDF]]).\n*[http://forums.serif.com/ Serif: User Support Forums].\n\n=== Further reading ===\n* {{cite web| title =Serif&nbsp;\u2013 MoviePlus 5 review| publisher =[[ITreviews]]| date =2006-06-20| url =http://www.itreviews.co.uk/software/s376.htm| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060924053626/http://www.itreviews.co.uk/software/s376.htm| archivedate =2006-09-24}}\n* {{cite web\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Serif&nbsp;\u2013 MoviePlus 5 review\n  | work = \n  | publisher = Computeract!ve\n  | date = 2006-12-05\n  | url = http://www.vnunet.com/computeractive/software/2156004/serif-movieplus-video-editing\n  | format = \n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930200144/http://www.vnunet.com/computeractive/software/2156004/serif-movieplus-video-editing|archivedate=2007-09-30}}\n* {{cite web\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Serif&nbsp;\u2013 MoviePlus 4 review\n  | work = \n  | publisher = Computeract!ve\n  | date = 2005-07-28\n  | url = http://www.pcw.co.uk/computeractive/software/2140468/serif-movie-plus\n  | format = \n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Movieplus}}\n[[Category:Video editing software]]\n[[Category:Windows multimedia software]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Software\n| name = Serif MoviePlus\n| logo=\n| screenshot = MoviePlusX5.jpg\n| screenshot size = 350px\n| caption = MoviePlus X5\n| developer = [[Serif Europe|Serif]]\n| latest_release_version = X6\n| latest_release_date = {{Start date and age|2012|03|05}}\n| operating_system = [[Microsoft Windows]]\n| genre = [[Video editing software]]\n| license = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]]\n| website = {{URL|www.serif.com/movieplus}}\n|released={{Start date and age|2003}}|discontinued=yes<ref>{{cite web|title=MoviePlus has been discontinued|url=http://www.serif.com/movieplus/|website=Serif|publisher=Serif Europe Ltd.|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref>}}\n'''Serif MoviePlus''' was a [[video editing software]] created by [[Serif Europe]] that allowed both professional and home users to edit digital video and digital images.\n\nThis software is no longer supported, as Serif are concentrating on their Affinity range.\n\nMoviePlus was affordable and popular with home and semi-professional filmmakers.
