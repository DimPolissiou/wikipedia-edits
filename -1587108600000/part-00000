She taught in Ottawa, Ontario, at [[Carleton University]]'s School of Social Work, from 1972 to 1988, where she introduced radical feminism into the school\u2019s structural approach to [[social work]]. Levine was recognized for her achievement in advancing the status of women: she was awarded Canada\u2019s [[Governor General\u2019s Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case]], in 1989.<ref>Robbins et al., ed., ''Inventing Feminist Scholarship and Women\u2019s Studies'', 351.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\nLevine was born to Rebecca (n\u00e9e Yaffe) Zivian and Isaac Zivian, in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]. She attended [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen\u2019s University]] before graduating from the [[University of Toronto]] School of Social Work. In Toronto she met [[union organizer]], Gilbert Levine (1924\u20132009), and the two were married in 1947, before conceiving two children: Ruthie Tamara Levine and Karen Levine.<ref>Stinson, \u201cA Tribute to Gilbert Levine,\u201d 176\u2013177.</ref>\n\nLevine initially worked as a [[homemaking|homemaker]], and also worked part-time for the Ottawa branch of the [[Children\u2019s Aid Society(Ontario)|Children's Aid Society]].<ref name=Crawford>Crawford B., \u201cFeminist, activist, ukulele player: Ottawa\u2019s Helen Levine lived and died 'on her own terms.'\"</ref> She was featured in the [[Studio D]] documentary, ''Motherland: Tales of Wonder'', where she expressed her frustration at social pressures placed on traditional stay-at-home mothers: \u201cI couldn\u2019t be the hand maiden. I couldn\u2019t be the assistant \u2026 I couldn\u2019t go back to pretending that my own existence didn\u2019t matter.\u201d<ref>Helen Levine, interview by Helen Klodawsky, ''Motherland: Tales of Wonder'', National Film Board of Canada, 1994.</ref> Her resulting [[depression (mood)|depression]] led to her hospitalization, in 1970: an experience which informed her subsequent writings, teachings, and feminist counselling practice.<ref name=Lundy208>Lundy, ''Social Work, Social Justice & Human Rights'', 208.</ref>\n\nLevine became a faculty member at [[Carleton University|Carleton University's]] School of Social Work, in 1972, during the [[second-wave feminism]] period. She practiced [[feminist therapy|feminist counselling]] and volunteered for [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit organizations]] that advocated for women\u2019s rights. After her retirement, Levine continued practising feminist counselling and advocating for women\u2019s rights.\n<ref name=Crawford/> She founded a group for older women, \u2018The Crones,\u2019 and volunteered for the [[Older Women\u2019s League]] (OWL).<ref name=Crawford/> Levine helped establish a [[women\u2019s shelter]], Ottawa's Internal House: the city's first shelter for women who had suffered domestic violence. In 1998, she was awarded the [[YWCA]] Ottawa Woman of Distinction Lifetime Achievement Award. \n\nLevine died in Ottawa, Ontario, at age 95, by [[assisted suicide|medically assisted death]]. In 2019 her personal records were donated to the University of Ottawa Archives and Special Collections.<ref>Helen Levine fonds, 10-006, University of Ottawa Archives and Special Collections, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.</ref>\n\n==Career at the School of Social Work==\nIn the early 1970s, the School of Social Work at Carleton University had adopted the radical structural approach to teaching social work: one that examined the exploitative nature of establishments and social institutions.<ref name=Lundy>Lundy,''Social Work, Social Justice & Human Rights'', 66-67.</ref> Levine integrated her radical feminism within the school, examining how institutions, such as [[patriarchy]], contributed to social problems.\n\nLevine taught feminist courses and [[women\u2019s studies]] courses, such as: \u201cStatus of Women,\u201d \u201cWomen and Welfare,\u201d and also \u201cFeminist Counselling.\u201d<ref name=Lundy/> Her feminist theory and published articles focussed on how women\u2019s experiences and treatment within the mental health system were determined by [[gender role]] and social expectations.<ref name=Lundy208/> She critiqued the conventional helping professions, proposing the adoption of feminist perspectives as an alternative approach to social intervention with women. \n\nAccording to Maritime School of Social Work Professor Joan Gilroy, \"what Helen did was to change the focus so that social workers began to look at the phenomena\u2013wife battering, incest, rape, sexual abuse\u2013and began to analyze the social fabric from this broader perspective, from a perspective of social inequality\".<ref name= Crawford/>\n\nShe was awarded the Bessie Touzel Award in 1993, by the Ontario Association of Professional Social Workers.\n\n==Bibliography==\n \n===List of works===\n* ''Between Friends: A Year in Letters'' by Berry Oonagh and Helen Levine (2005)\n* \"Fanning Fires: Women\u2019s Studies in a School of Social Work\" in ''Minds of Our Own: Inventing Feminist Scholarship and Women\u2019s Studies in Canada and Qu\u00e9bec, 1966-76'' (2008)\n* \"Feminist Counselling: A look at New Possibilities\" in the Special Issue of ''Social Worker'' (1976)\n* \"Feminist Counseling: A Woman-Centered Approach\" in ''Women, Work and Wellness'' (1989)\n* \"On Women and On One Woman\" in ''Women: Their Use of Alcohol and Other Legal Drugs'' (1976)\n* \"The Personal Is Political: Feminism and the Helping Professions\" in ''Feminism in Canada: From Pressure to Politics'' (1982)\n* ''The Power Politics of Motherhood: A Feminist Critique of Theory and Practice'' by Alma Estable and Helen Levine (1981)\n\n==Awards==\n* In October 1989, Levine was one of six women across Canada to receive the Governor General\u2019s Person\u2019s Award, in recognition of her contribution to improving the status of Canadian women.\n* Levine was awarded the Bessie Touzel Award, in 1993, for lifelong achievement in the field of social work as recognized by the Ontario Association of Social Workers (OASW).\n* In 1998, Helen Levine was awarded the Ottawa YWCA Ottawa Woman of Distinction Lifetime Achievement Award, celebrating trailblazing women who have excelled in their fields and supported the advancement of women.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Berry, Oonagh, and Helen Levine.

She taught in Ottawa, Ontario, at [[Carleton University]]'s School of Social Work, from 1972 to 1988, where she introduced radical feminism into the school\u2019s structural approach to [[social work]]. Levine was recognized for her achievement in advancing the status of women: she was awarded Canada\u2019s [[Governor General\u2019s Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case]], in 1989.<ref>Robbins et al., ed., ''Inventing Feminist Scholarship and Women\u2019s Studies'', 351.</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\nLevine was born to Rebecca (n\u00e9e Yaffe) Zivian and Isaac Zivian, in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]. She attended [[Queen\u2019s University]] before graduating from the [[University of Toronto]] School of Social Work. In Toronto she met [[union organizer]], Gilbert Levine (1924\u20132009), and the two were married in 1947, before conceiving two children: Ruthie Tamara Levine and Karen Levine.<ref>Stinson, \u201cA Tribute to Gilbert Levine,\u201d 176\u2013177.</ref>\n\nLevine initially worked as a [[homemaking|homemaker]], and also worked part-time for the Ottawa branch of the [[Children\u2019s Aid Society(Ontario)|Children's Aid Society]].<ref name=Crawford>Crawford B., \u201cFeminist, activist, ukulele player: Ottawa\u2019s Helen Levine lived and died 'on her own terms.'\"</ref> She was featured in the [[Studio D]] documentary, ''Motherland: Tales of Wonder'', where she expressed her frustration at social pressures placed on traditional stay-at-home mothers: \u201cI couldn\u2019t be the hand maiden. I couldn\u2019t be the assistant \u2026 I couldn\u2019t go back to pretending that my own existence didn\u2019t matter.\u201d<ref>Helen Levine, interview by Helen Klodawsky, ''Motherland: Tales of Wonder'', National Film Board of Canada, 1994.</ref> Her resulting [[depression]] led to her hospitalization, in 1970: an experience which informed her subsequent writings, teachings, and feminist counselling practice.<ref name=Lundy208>Lundy, ''Social Work, Social Justice & Human Rights'', 208.</ref>\n\nLevine became a faculty member at [[Carleton University|Carleton University's]] School of Social Work, in 1972, during the [[second-wave feminism]] period. She practiced [[feminist therapy|feminist counselling]] and volunteered for [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit organizations]] that advocated for women\u2019s rights. After her retirement, Levine continued practising feminist counselling and advocating for women\u2019s rights.\n<ref name=Crawford/> She founded a group for older women, \u2018The Crones,\u2019 and volunteered for the [[Older Women\u2019s League]] (OWL).<ref name=Crawford/> Levine helped establish a [[women\u2019s shelter]], Ottawa's Internal House: the city's first shelter for women who had suffered domestic violence. In 1998, she was awarded the [[YWCA]] Ottawa Woman of Distinction Lifetime Achievement Award. \n\nLevine died in Ottawa, Ontario, at age 95, by [[assisted suicide|medically assisted death]]. In 2019 her personal records were donated to the University of Ottawa Archives and Special Collections.<ref>Helen Levine fonds, 10-006, University of Ottawa Archives and Special Collections, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.</ref>\n\n==Career at the School of Social Work==\nIn the early 1970s, the School of Social Work at Carleton University had adopted the radical structural approach to teaching social work: one that examined the exploitative nature of establishments and social institutions.<ref name=Lundy>Lundy,''Social Work, Social Justice & Human Rights'', 66-67.</ref> Levine integrated her radical feminism within the school, examining how institutions, such as [[patriarchy]], contributed to social problems.\n\nLevine taught feminist courses and [[women\u2019s studies]] courses, such as: \u201cStatus of Women,\u201d \u201cWomen and Welfare,\u201d and also \u201cFeminist Counselling.\u201d<ref name=Lundy/> Her feminist theory and published articles focussed on how women\u2019s experiences and treatment within the mental health system were determined by [[gender role]] and social expectations.<ref name=Lundy208/> She critiqued the conventional helping professions, proposing the adoption of feminist perspectives as an alternative approach to social intervention with women. \n\nAccording to Maritime School of Social Work Professor Joan Gilroy, \"what Helen did was to change the focus so that social workers began to look at the phenomena\u2013wife battering, incest, rape, sexual abuse\u2013and began to analyze the social fabric from this broader perspective, from a perspective of social inequality\".<ref name= Crawford/>\n\nShe was awarded the Bessie Touzel Award in 1993, by the Ontario Association of Professional Social Workers.\n\n==Bibliography==\n \n===List of works===\n* ''Between Friends: A Year in Letters'' by Berry Oonagh and Helen Levine (2005)\n* \"Fanning Fires: Women\u2019s Studies in a School of Social Work\" in ''Minds of Our Own: Inventing Feminist Scholarship and Women\u2019s Studies in Canada and Qu\u00e9bec, 1966-76'' (2008)\n* \"Feminist Counselling: A look at New Possibilities\" in the Special Issue of ''Social Worker'' (1976)\n* \"Feminist Counseling: A Woman-Centered Approach\" in ''Women, Work and Wellness'' (1989)\n* \"On Women and On One Woman\" in ''Women: Their Use of Alcohol and Other Legal Drugs'' (1976)\n* \"The Personal Is Political: Feminism and the Helping Professions\" in ''Feminism in Canada: From Pressure to Politics'' (1982)\n* ''The Power Politics of Motherhood: A Feminist Critique of Theory and Practice'' by Alma Estable and Helen Levine (1981)\n\n==Awards==\n* In October 1989, Levine was one of six women across Canada to receive the Governor General\u2019s Person\u2019s Award, in recognition of her contribution to improving the status of Canadian women.\n* Levine was awarded the Bessie Touzel Award, in 1993, for lifelong achievement in the field of social work as recognized by the Ontario Association of Social Workers (OASW).\n* In 1998, Helen Levine was awarded the Ottawa YWCA Ottawa Woman of Distinction Lifetime Achievement Award, celebrating trailblazing women who have excelled in their fields and supported the advancement of women.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Berry, Oonagh, and Helen Levine.

He first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #226 (Nov 1970) and was created by [[Frank Robbins]], [[Irv Novick]], and [[Dick Giordano]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=346-347}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Pre-''Crisis''===\n'''Philip Reardon''' served as a [[soldier]] in the [[U.S. Special Forces]] during the [[Vietnam War]] until he was honorably discharged after a grenade fragment hit him between the eyes. He returned to civilian life as a warehouse [[security guard]]. One night, he was knocked out by thieves who planted a bomb to blow up the warehouse. When [[Batman]] arrived at the scene, Reardon recovered but his vision was blurred. Mistaking Batman for one of the thieves, Reardon battled him. When he recognized Batman, the warehouse exploded and Reardon's retinas were burned, which impacted his war injury and blinded him permanently in both eyes. A brilliant ophthalmologist named Dr. Engstrom tended to Reardon after being brought to him by the crooks where he reconnected Reardon's optic nerves to the sensory cells in his fingertips. In addition to this, Dr. Engstrom granted Reardon's fingers the gift of sight enabling him to see through them. He blamed Batman for what had happened and took his revenge on him under the identity of the Ten-Eyed Man. As Batman was also affected by the blast, he used black contact lenses to help him out. As Ten-Eyed Man attacked Batman, [[Alfred Pennyworth]] helps Batman by coordinating instructions to him through the microphone in Batman's mask. Upon finding out that Ten-Eyed Man can see through his hands, Batman used this to his advantage by using his cape to wrap up Ten-Eyed Man's hands and then knocked him unconscious. After Batman contacted Dr. Engstrom, Ten-Eyed Man got away.<ref>''Batman'' #226</ref>\n\nWaking up one night in his apartment following a nightmare involving Batman attacking him with a flamethrower, Ten-Eyed Man finds himself unable to see thinking that Batman blinded him again only to remember that he had placed gloves on his hands since his \"eyes\" don't have eyelids. He then goes to apply for a job as an [[air marshal]] which he passes with his talents and starts making plans to have his revenge on Batman. After hijacking an airplane as a way to lure Batman to Vietnam as part of his revenge, Ten-Eyed Man led Batman on a cat and mouse chase in the jungle using traps that were left after the Vietnam War. He tried to blind Batman with a chemical grenade, but Batman placed Ten-Eyed Man's hands in a mud pool so that Batman can subdue him and bring him to justice.<ref>''Batman'' #231</ref>\n\nWhen incarcerated at [[Gotham State Penitentiary]], Ten-Eyed Man was kept in a jail cell where the correction officers had his hands locked in a special box that kept him blind all day and night because with eyes on his fingers, \"escape would be child's play for him,\" although precisely ''how'' this would be the case was not elaborated upon. Because of his indisputably unique abilities, he was employed by persons unknown as the only villain worthy to attack [[Man-Bat]]. He was even provided a supervillain costume to go with his talents. During this fight, Man-Bat threw a shrub at him where Ten-Eyed Man hurt his \"eyes\" when he caught it. After getting some distance from Ten-Eyed Man, Man-Bat caught his breath and figured out who Ten-Eyed Man is. What he doesn't know is that the Civil Liberties Association had hired Ten-Eyed Man to attack him. Upon fighting Ten-Eyed Man who was preparing to fire a magnesium flare bomb, Man-Bat forces Ten-Eyed Man into dropping the bomb enough to emit a blind light that causes Ten-Eyed Man to be temporarily blinded and fall off the building.<ref>''Man-Bat'' #2</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' storyline, Ten-Eyed Man was accidentally killed by [[Anti-Monitor]]'s shadow demons.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12</ref> It was reportedly at the specific request of [[Marv Wolfman]] to put him among a list of characters he wanted to kill first.\n\nHis only appearance after that was along with other characters who were wiped out by the Crisis that were recreated by [[Psycho-Pirate]].<ref>''Animal Man'' #23</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Ten-Eyed Man first appears among the inmates at [[Arkham Asylum]] that attack Batman and [[Jim Corrigan]].<ref>''Batman Eternal'' #15</ref>\n\nTen-Eyed Man is one of the many villains taken down by Batman and Catwoman after he takes her along with him on an average night of his job.<ref>''Batman'' vol. 3 #14</ref>\n\nTen-Eyed Man later kidnapped a girl named Jade who was under [[Killer Croc]]'s protection where he plans to sacrifice her in order to find out the doom that is coming for him. One of his fingers sees Batman, Killer Croc, and [[Jason Bard]] above as they leap down towards him upon being discovered.<ref>''Batman Eternal'' #19</ref> Batman, Jason Bard, and Killer Croc work to stop Ten-Eyed Man before he can sacrifice Jade so that he can open an inter-dimensional portal. His plot is thwarted by Batman and Jason Bard.<ref>''Batman Eternal'' #20</ref>\n\nFollowing Arkham Asylum's destruction, the [[Gotham City Police Department]]'s headquarters is filled with its inmates. [[Maggie Sawyer]] tries to get the answers on what happened there from the inmates starting with Ten-Eyed Man. He tells Maggie that he can help her with the answers she needs if she would remove the hand masks from his hands. After being unable to get answers from Ten-Eyed Man, Maggie Sawyer then attempts to get answers from [[Maxie Zeus]], [[Magpie (character)|Magpie]], and the other Arkham Asylum inmates.<ref>''Batman Eternal'' #44</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nTen-Eyed Man can see through optic nerves in his fingertips, giving him a complete 360 view and limited periscopic vision. His enhanced vision augments his Special Forces training, making him a superb fighter and marksman.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn issue 30 of DC's year-long ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' limited series, an entirely new take on the Ten-Eyed Man was introduced. The '''Ten-Eyed Men of the Empty Quarter''' are a nomadic tribe that inhabit the \"Empty Quarter\" of an unspecified Middle Eastern desert (though \"the [[Empty Quarter]]\" is the name of a region in [[Saudi Arabia]]) and are dedicated to hunting demons. They wear blindfolds and loose-fitting robes with turbans, and have eyes similar to the original Ten-Eyed Man's tattooed on their fingertips. During the issue, Bruce Wayne wanders the desert in search of them, defeats one of their number in hand-to-hand combat, and asks for them to exorcise his personal demons. When [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] catches up to him, Bruce tells him that they have \"cut out all the dark, fearful, paranoid urges that I've allowed to corrupt my life\" and that \"Batman is gone.\" Whether there is any connection between this tribe and the villainous Ten-Eyed Man is unknown, but it is unlikely since the original villain was removed from continuity. An exiled member of this tribe, lacking a finger, is introduced as a terrorist in ''Batman'' #675. He kidnaps [[Jezebel Jet]], and is defeated by Bruce Wayne, who was so unstable at that point that he didn't even change to his Batman uniform. [[Grant Morrison]] referred to this character as the Nine-Eyed Man.<ref>''Batman'' #675 (April 2008)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Ten-Eyed Man appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]. This version is drawn to have \"eyes\" on his fingertips. In the episode \"A Bat Divided\", he is seen in a bar where the villains hang out when [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and the three Batmen show up. Ten-Eyed Man is among the villains that fight Firestorm and the three Batmen and is defeated. He later appears at the beginning of the episode \"Emperor Joker\" where he tries to rob a jewelry store only to fight Batman. [[Bat-Mite]] appeared during the fight while reviewing Ten-Eyed Man's history.

He first appeared in ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #226 (Nov 1970) and was created by [[Frank Robbins]], [[Irv Novick]], and [[Dick Giordano]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=346-347}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Pre-''Crisis''===\n'''Philip Reardon''' served as a [[soldier]] in the [[U.S. Special Forces]] during the [[Vietnam War]] until he was honorably discharged after a grenade fragment hit him between the eyes. He returned to civilian life as a warehouse [[security guard]]. One night, he was knocked out by thieves who planted a bomb to blow up the warehouse. When [[Batman]] arrived at the scene, Reardon recovered but his vision was blurred. Mistaking Batman for one of the thieves, Reardon battled him. When he recognized Batman, the warehouse exploded and Reardon's retinas were burned, which impacted his war injury and blinded him permanently in both eyes. A brilliant ophthalmologist named Dr. Engstrom tended to Reardon after being brought to him by the crooks where he reconnected Reardon's optic nerves to the sensory cells in his fingertips. In addition to this, Dr. Engstrom granted Reardon's fingers the gift of sight enabling him to see through them. He blamed Batman for what had happened and took his revenge on him under the identity of the Ten-Eyed Man. As Batman was also affected by the blast, he used black contact lenses to help him out. As Ten-Eyed Man attacked Batman, [[Alfred Pennyworth]] helps Batman by coordinating instructions to him through the microphone in Batman's mask. Upon finding out that Ten-Eyed Man can see through his hands, Batman used this to his advantage by using his cape to wrap up Ten-Eyed Man's hands and then knocked him unconscious. After Batman contacted Dr. Engstrom, Ten-Eyed Man got away.<ref>''Batman'' #226</ref>\n\nWaking up one night in his apartment following a nightmare involving Batman attacking him with a flamethrower, Ten-Eyed Man finds himself unable to see thinking that Batman blinded him again only to remember that he had placed gloves on his hands since his \"eyes\" don't have eyelids. He then goes to apply for a job as an [[air marshal]] which he passes with his talents and starts making plans to have his revenge on Batman. After hijacking an airplane as a way to lure Batman to Vietnam as part of his revenge, Ten-Eyed Man led Batman on a cat and mouse chase in the jungle using traps that were left after the Vietnam War. He tried to blind Batman with a chemical grenade, but Batman placed Ten-Eyed Man's hands in a mud pool so that Batman can subdue him and bring him to justice.<ref>''Batman'' #231</ref>\n\nWhen incarcerated at [[Gotham State Penitentiary]], Ten-Eyed Man was kept in a jail cell where the correction officers had his hands locked in a special box that kept him blind all day and night because with eyes on his fingers, \"escape would be child's play for him,\" although precisely ''how'' this would be the case was not elaborated upon. Because of his indisputably unique abilities, he was employed by persons unknown as the only villain worthy to attack [[Man-Bat]]. He was even provided a supervillain costume to go with his talents. During this fight, Man-Bat threw a shrub at him where Ten-Eyed Man hurt his \"eyes\" when he caught it. After getting some distance from Ten-Eyed Man, Man-Bat caught his breath and figured out who Ten-Eyed Man is. What he doesn't know is that the Civil Liberties Association had hired Ten-Eyed Man to attack him. Upon fighting Ten-Eyed Man who was preparing to fire a magnesium flare bomb, Man-Bat forces Ten-Eyed Man into dropping the bomb enough to emit a blind light that causes Ten-Eyed Man to be temporarily blinded and fall off the building.<ref>''Man-Bat'' #2</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' storyline, Ten-Eyed Man was accidentally killed by [[Anti-Monitor]]'s shadow demons.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12</ref> It was reportedly at the specific request of [[Marv Wolfman]] to put him among a list of characters he wanted to kill first.\n\nHis only appearance after that was along with other characters who were wiped out by the Crisis that were recreated by [[Psycho-Pirate]].<ref>''Animal Man'' #23</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Ten-Eyed Man first appears among the inmates at [[Arkham Asylum]] that attack Batman and [[Jim Corrigan]].<ref>''Batman Eternal'' #15</ref>\n\nTen-Eyed Man is one of the many villains taken down by Batman and Catwoman after he takes her along with him on an average night of his job.<ref>''Batman'' vol. 3 #14</ref>\n\nTen-Eyed Man later kidnapped a girl named Jade who was under [[Killer Croc]]'s protection where he plans to sacrifice her in order to find out the doom that is coming for him. One of his fingers sees Batman, Killer Croc, and [[Jason Bard]] above as they leap down towards him upon being discovered.<ref>''Batman Eternal'' #19</ref> Batman, Jason Bard, and Killer Croc work to stop Ten-Eyed Man before he can sacrifice Jade so that he can open an inter-dimensional portal. His plot is thwarted by Batman and Jason Bard.<ref>''Batman Eternal'' #20</ref>\n\nFollowing Arkham Asylum's destruction, the [[Gotham City Police Department]]'s headquarters is filled with its inmates. [[Maggie Sawyer]] tries to get the answers on what happened there from the inmates starting with Ten-Eyed Man. He tells Maggie that he can help her with the answers she needs if she would remove the hand masks from his hands. After being unable to get answers from Ten-Eyed Man, Maggie Sawyer then attempts to get answers from [[Maxie Zeus]], [[Magpie (character)|Magpie]], and the other Arkham Asylum inmates.<ref>''Batman Eternal'' #44</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nTen-Eyed Man can see through optic nerves in his fingertips, giving him a complete 360 view and limited periscopic vision. His enhanced vision augments his Special Forces training, making him a superb fighter and marksman.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn issue 30 of DC's year-long ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' limited series, an entirely new take on the Ten-Eyed Man was introduced. The '''Ten-Eyed Men of the Empty Quarter''' are a nomadic tribe that inhabit the \"Empty Quarter\" of an unspecified Middle Eastern desert (though \"the [[Empty Quarter]]\" is the name of a region in [[Saudi Arabia]]) and are dedicated to hunting demons. They wear blindfolds and loose-fitting robes with turbans, and have eyes similar to the original Ten-Eyed Man's tattooed on their fingertips. During the issue, Bruce Wayne wanders the desert in search of them, defeats one of their number in hand-to-hand combat, and asks for them to exorcise his personal demons. When [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] catches up to him, Bruce tells him that they have \"cut out all the dark, fearful, paranoid urges that I've allowed to corrupt my life\" and that \"Batman is gone.\" Whether there is any connection between this tribe and the villainous Ten-Eyed Man is unknown, but it is unlikely since the original villain was removed from continuity. An exiled member of this tribe, lacking a finger, is introduced as a terrorist in ''Batman'' #675. He kidnaps [[Jezebel Jet]], and is defeated by Bruce Wayne, who was so unstable at that point that he didn't even change to his Batman uniform. [[Grant Morrison]] referred to this character as the Nine-Eyed Man.<ref>''Batman'' #675 (April 2008)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Ten-Eyed Man appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]. This version is drawn to have \"eyes\" on his fingertips. In the episode \"A Bat Divided\", he is seen in a bar where the villains hang out when [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and the three Batmen show up. Ten-Eyed Man is among the villains that fight Firestorm and the three Batmen and is defeated. He later appears at the beginning of the episode \"Emperor Joker\" where he tries to rob a jewelry store only to fight Batman. [[Bat-Mite]] appeared during the fight while reviewing Ten-Eyed Man's history. After Batman cuts himself free from Ten-Eyed Man's eye-themed Belt Net, Bat-Mite then turns one of Batman's Batarangs into a cactus as Batman tricks Ten-Eyed Man into catching it. Ten-Eyed Man catches the cactus which hurts his \"eyes\" as Batman ties him up.\n* In the \"Tales of Metropolis\" segment of ''[[DC Nation Shorts]]'', the episode where [[Lois Lane]] tries to ask Batman questions has one of them being who the scariest villain that Batman has faced.

Before the discovery of ''Methanocaldococcus sp.'' FS406-22, ''Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus was'' the most thermophilic [[microorganism]], fixing nitrogen at 64&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\":1\" /> This particular discovery has potential to reveal a much wider range of conditions for life not only, in the seafloor biosphere but also, other [[ecosystem]]s that are [[Nitrogen deficiency|nitrogen deficient]]''.''

FS406-22, is 99% similar to that of ''[[Methanocaldococcus jannaschii]]'' DSM 2661.<ref name=\":1\" /> This odd 1% [[divergence]] between FS406-22 and ''M. jannaschii'' is due to a previous separation of ancestral genes. The revelation of a hyperthermophilic, diazotrophic, archaea (strain FS406-22) may be due to the [[evolutionary]] history of [[nitrogenous]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The [[phylogenetic analysis]] of nitrogenous and chlorophyll iron [[protein]]s suggests that an ancestral iron protein [[Gene duplication|duplicated]] and [[Genetic divergence|diverged]] into ''[[Nif gene|nifH]]'' and ''anfH'' genes.<ref name=\":1\" /> This divergence of genes is estimated to have happened before the separation of the [[Domain (biology)|Domains]] bacteria and methanogenic archaea.<ref name=\":1\" /> Strain FS406-22 contains a functional ''nifH'' gene which is able to encode [[Dinitrogenase|dinitrogenase reductase]] whereas ''M. jannaschii'' does not possess this gene, explaining the 1% divergence between the two species.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2015.03.025 | volume=117 | title=The CRISPR-Cas immune system: Biology, mechanisms and applications | year=2015 | journal=Biochimie | pages=119\u2013128 | last1 = Rath | first1 = Devashish}}.\n* {{cite journal | pmid = 22554235 | doi=10.1186/1471-2164-13-162 | volume=13 | title=Distribution of nitrogen fixation and nitrogenase-like sequences amongst microbial genomes | pmc=3464626 | year=2012 | journal=BMC Genomics | page=162 | last1 = Dos Santos | first1 = PC | last2 = Fang | first2 = Z | last3 = Mason | first3 = SW | last4 = Setubal | first4 = JC | last5 = Dixon | first5 = R}}. \n* {{cite journal | pmid = 21410492 | doi=10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01090.x | volume=77 | title=Using CRISPRs as a metagenomic tool to identify microbial hosts of a diffuse flow hydrothermal vent viral assemblage | year=2011 | journal=FEMS Microbiol Ecol | pages=120\u201333 | last1 = Anderson | first1 = RE | last2 = Brazelton | first2 = WJ | last3 = Baross | first3 = JA}}\n\n===External links ===\n* [http://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_organism?org=mfs KEGG entry for ''Methanocaldococcus sp.''

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Don Salvador Dal\u00ed y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals. The final straw was when Don Salvador read in a Barcelona newspaper that his son had recently exhibited in Paris a drawing of the ''Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ'', with a provocative inscription: \"Sometimes, I spit for fun on my mother's portrait\".<ref name=\"Meisler\" /><ref name=\"isbn0-571-19380-3\" /> Outraged, Don Salvador demanded that his son recant publicly. Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]]. He soon bought the cabin, and over the years enlarged it by buying neighboring ones, gradually building his beloved [[villa]] by the sea.

The earlier exhibition included sixteen paintings of which ''The Persistence of Memory'' attracted the most attention.

Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her.

He executed designs for a number of ballets including ''Labyrinth'' (1942), ''Sentimental Colloquy'', ''Mad Tristan'', and ''The Cafe of Chinitas'' (all 1944).<ref name=\":1\">Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 431-43</ref> In 1945 he created the dream sequence for Alfred Hitchcock's film ''Spellbound''.<ref name=\":2\">Gibson, Ian (1997) p 434-45</ref> He also produced art work and designs for products such as perfumes, cosmetics, hosiery and ties.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 430-31</ref>\n\n====== Post War in United States (1946-48) ======\nIn 1946 Dal\u00ed worked with Walt Disney and animator John Hench on an unfinished animated film ''[[Destino]]''.<ref name=\":3\">Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 436-38</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed exhibited new work at the Bignou Gallery from November 1947 to January 1948. The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''. The proportions of the latter work were worked out in collaboration with a mathematician.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 440-42</ref>\n\nIn early 1948 Dal\u00ed's ''50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship'' was published.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was accused of assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting. In 1949 he painted a study for ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and showed it to Pope Pius XII during an audience arranged to discuss Dali's marriage to Gala.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 450-53</ref> This work was a precursor to the phase Dal\u00ed dubbed \"Nuclear Mysticism,\" a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism and Catholic mysticism.  In paintings such as ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]],'' ''[[Christ of Saint John of the Cross|The Christ of Saint John on the Cross]]'' and ''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]],'' Dal\u00ed sought to synthesize Christian [[iconography]] with images of material disintegration inspired by [[nuclear physics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed Bio, Art on 5th|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504050531/http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|archive-date=4 May 2006|access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 461-63</ref> His later Nuclear Mysticism works included ''[[La Gare de Perpignan]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Hallucinogenic Toreador]]'' (1968\u201370).\n\nDal\u00ed's keen interest in natural science and [[mathematics and art|mathematics]] was further manifested by the proliferation of images of DNA and [[rhinoceros horn]] shapes in works from the mid-1950s.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behavior throughout his career.

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again.

The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was accused of assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting. In 1949 he painted a study for ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and showed it to Pope Pius XII during an audience arranged to discuss Dali's marriage to Gala.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 450-53</ref> This work was a precursor to the phase Dal\u00ed dubbed \"Nuclear Mysticism,\" a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism and Catholic mysticism.  In paintings such as ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]],'' ''[[Christ of Saint John of the Cross|The Christ of Saint John on the Cross]]'' and ''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]],'' Dal\u00ed sought to synthesize Christian [[iconography]] with images of material disintegration inspired by [[nuclear physics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed Bio, Art on 5th|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504050531/http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|archive-date=4 May 2006|access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 461-63</ref> His later Nuclear Mysticism works included ''[[La Gare de Perpignan]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Hallucinogenic Toreador]]'' (1968\u201370).\n\nDal\u00ed's keen interest in natural science and [[mathematics and art|mathematics]] was further manifested by the proliferation of images of DNA and [[rhinoceros horn]] shapes in works from the mid-1950s.

Other designs Dal\u00ed made for her include a shoe-shaped hat, and a pink belt with lips for a buckle. He was also involved in creating textile designs and perfume bottles. In 1950, Dal\u00ed created a special \"costume for the year 2045\" with [[Christian Dior]].<ref name=\"designws\">[http://www.designws.com/pagina/1dalieng.htm Dal\u00ed Rotterdam Museum Boijmans].

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dal\u00ed also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nDal\u00ed worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Workers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behavior throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!

It was played on October 26, 1997, between defending champion and hosts [[D.C. United]] and the [[Colorado Rapids]] to determine the champion of the [[1997 Major League Soccer season|1997 season]]. The match was played in front of 57,431 spectators at [[Robert F.

Substitute [[Adri\u00e1n Paz]] scored a consolation goal for Colorado in the 75th minute, but the team were unable to draw level. The 1997 final was the first MLS Cup to be decided in regular time and the first to be won by the host team. To date, this is the first and only championship game held in D.C. to be won by a [[Sports in Washington, D.C.|D.C.-based professional team]].

After several weeks of deliberation, [[Victoria Beckham|Victoria Adams]], [[Mel B|Melanie Brown]], [[Melanie Chisholm]], and [[Michelle Stephenson]] were among 12 women chosen to a second round of auditions in April; [[Geri Halliwell]] also attended the second audition, despite missing the first.<ref name=\"official timeline\">Spice Girls Official. \"[http://www.thespicegirls.com/facts/timeline Timeline] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Aul2e81q?url=http://www.thespicegirls.com/facts/timeline |date=24 September 2012 }}\".

During the session, Adams, Brown, Chisholm, Halliwell and Stephenson were selected for a band initially named \"Touch\".<ref name=\"official timeline\" /> The group moved to a house in [[Maidenhead]], [[Berkshire]], and spent most of 1994 practising songs which had been written for them by Bob Herbert's long-time associates [[John Thirkell]] and Erwin Keiles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rob |first1=McGibbon |title=Spice Power: The Inside Story |date=1997 |page=52}}</ref> During the first two months, they worked on [[Demo (music)|demos]] at South Hill Park Recording Studios in [[Bracknell, Berkshire|Bracknell]] with producer/studio owner Michael Sparkes and songwriter/arranger [[Tim Hawes]]. According to Stephenson, the material the group was given was \"very, very young pop\";<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004 book\">Sinclair (2004), p. 29</ref> one of the songs they recorded, \"Sugar and Spice\", would be the source of their final band name. They also worked on various dance routines at the Trinity Studios in [[Knaphill]], near [[Woking]], [[Surrey]]. A few months into the training period, Stephenson was fired from the group and replaced with [[Emma Bunton]].<ref>Sinclair (2004). According to Bob Herbert, she was fired because \"she just wasn't fitting in... she would never have gelled with it and I had to tell her to go\". (Sinclair, p. 30). Stephenson later challenged Herbert's claim, stating that it was her decision to leave due to her mother being diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. Adams later dismissed this claim, saying she \"just couldn't be arsed\" to put in the work the rest of the group was doing. (Sinclair, p. 31)</ref> It was also during this time that Halliwell came up with the band name Spice.<ref name=\"official timeline\" />\n\nThe group felt insecure about the lack of a contract and was frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In October 1994, armed with a catalogue of demos and dance routines, they began touring management agencies. They persuaded Bob Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers, and [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios, where they received an \"overwhelmingly positive\" reaction.<ref>Sinclair (2004), p. 33</ref> Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on legal advice from, among others, Adams's father.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\">Sinclair (2004)</ref>\n\nIn March 1995, the group parted from Heart Management due to their frustration with the company's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas. To ensure they kept control of their own work, they allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\"/><ref name=\"shampoo\" /> That same day, the group tracked down [[Sheffield]]-based producer [[Eliot Kennedy]], who had been present at the showcase, and persuaded him to work with them. They were introduced to record producers [[Absolute (production team)|Absolute]], who in turn brought them to the attention of [[Simon Fuller]] of [[19 Entertainment]], who signed them to his company in March 1995. During the summer of that year, the group toured record labels in London and Los Angeles with Fuller, signing a deal with [[Virgin Records]] in September 1995. Their name was changed to Spice Girls, as [[Spice 1|a rapper]] was already using the name \"Spice\".<ref name=\"official timeline\" /> From this point on until the summer of 1996, the group continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while extensively touring the west coast of the US, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\"/>\n\n===1996\u20131997: ''Spice'' and breakthrough===\n{{Main|Spice (album)}}\n[[File:Spice Girls live West MacLaren 1997.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The Spice Girls performing \"[[Say You'll Be There]]\" at the [[McLaren]] party in 1997]]\nOn 7 July 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single \"[[Wannabe]]\" in the United Kingdom.

In July 1996, the group conducted their first interview with [[Paul Gorman]], the contributing editor of music paper ''Music Week'', at Virgin Records' Paris headquarters.

During the session, Adams, Brown, Chisholm, Halliwell and Stephenson were selected for a band initially named \"Touch\".<ref name=\"official timeline\" /> The group moved to a house in [[Maidenhead]], [[Berkshire]], and spent most of 1994 practising songs which had been written for them by Bob Herbert's long-time associates [[John Thirkell]] and Erwin Keiles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rob |first1=McGibbon |title=Spice Power: The Inside Story |date=1997 |page=52}}</ref> During the first two months, they worked on [[Demo (music)|demos]] at South Hill Park Recording Studios in [[Bracknell, Berkshire|Bracknell]] with producer/studio owner Michael Sparkes and songwriter/arranger [[Tim Hawes]]. According to Stephenson, the material the group was given was \"very, very young pop\";<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004 book\">Sinclair (2004), p. 29</ref> one of the songs they recorded, \"Sugar and Spice\", would be the source of their final band name. They also worked on various dance routines at the Trinity Studios in [[Knaphill]], near [[Woking]], [[Surrey]]. A few months into the training period, Stephenson was fired from the group and replaced with [[Emma Bunton]].<ref>Sinclair (2004). According to Bob Herbert, she was fired because \"she just wasn't fitting in... she would never have gelled with it and I had to tell her to go\". (Sinclair, p. 30). Stephenson later challenged Herbert's claim, stating that it was her decision to leave due to her mother being diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. Adams later dismissed this claim, saying she \"just couldn't be arsed\" to put in the work the rest of the group was doing. (Sinclair, p. 31)</ref> It was also during this time that Halliwell came up with the band name Spice.<ref name=\"official timeline\" />\n\nThe group felt insecure about the lack of a contract and was frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In October 1994, armed with a catalogue of demos and dance routines, they began touring management agencies. They persuaded Bob Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers, and [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios, where they received an \"overwhelmingly positive\" reaction.<ref>Sinclair (2004), p. 33</ref> Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on legal advice from, among others, Adams's father.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\">Sinclair (2004)</ref>\n\nIn March 1995, the group parted from Heart Management due to their frustration with the company's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas. To ensure they kept control of their own work, they allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\"/><ref name=\"shampoo\" /> That same day, the group tracked down [[Sheffield]]-based producer [[Eliot Kennedy]], who had been present at the showcase, and persuaded him to work with them. They were introduced to record producers [[Absolute (production team)|Absolute]], who in turn brought them to the attention of [[Simon Fuller]] of [[19 Entertainment]], who signed them to his company in March 1995. During the summer of that year, the group toured record labels in London and Los Angeles with Fuller, signing a deal with [[Virgin Records]] in September 1995. Their name was changed to Spice Girls, as [[Spice 1|a rapper]] was already using the name \"Spice\".<ref name=\"official timeline\" /> From this point on until the summer of 1996, the group continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while extensively touring the west coast of the US, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\"/>\n\n===1996\u20131997: ''Spice'' and breakthrough===\n{{Main|Spice (album)}}\n[[File:Spice Girls live West MacLaren 1997.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The Spice Girls performing \"[[Say You'll Be There]]\" at the [[McLaren]] party in 1997]]\nOn 7 July 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single \"[[Wannabe]]\" in the United Kingdom.

The fair, the theme of which was \"Transportation and Communication: World in Motion - World in Touch\", coincided with Vancouver's centennial and was held on the north shore of False Creek. It was the second time that Canada held a World's Fair, the first being [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]] (during the [[Canadian Centennial]]).  It was also the third World's Fair to be held in the Pacific Northwest in the previous 24 years as of 1986 and as of 2020 it still stands as the last World's Fair to be held in North America.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Expo 86 - monorail.jpg|thumb|The monorail at Expo 86. After the site closed, it was shipped to [[England]] where it was installed at the [[Alton Towers]] [[theme park]] in 1987.]]\nThe logo of three interlocking rings to make the 86 in the logo stood for the three main modes of transportation; land, air, and water.\n\n===Background===\nUp until the late 1970s, the 173 acre (0.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) site on [[False Creek]], where Expo was staged, was a former [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] rail yard and an industrial wasteland.  In 1978, [[Sam Bawlf]] (then BC Minister of Recreation and Conservation) proposed an exposition to celebrate Vancouver's centennial year (1986). The proposal was submitted in June 1979, for a fair that was to be called \"Transpo 86.\" In 1980, the British Columbia Legislature passed the Transpo 86 Corporation Act, paving the way for the fair.  The transportation theme reflected the city's role in connecting Canada by rail, its status as a major port and transportation hub, and the role of transportation in communications.\n\nThe vagina like initial idea was to have \"...a modest $80 million transportation exposition that would mark Vancouver's 100th anniversary.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Peter Stoler|first=Rudolph, Barbara |author= |authorlink= |date=28 April 1986 |title= Westward Ho to Expo 86|trans-title=|magazine=Time Magazine|volume= |series= |issue= |page= |pages= |at= |chapter= |location= |publisher= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |language= |id= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |doi= |accessdate=1 November 2011 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961308-2,00.html }}</ref> It soon blossomed into a full exposition thanks to the help of the Vancouver Exposition Commissioner-General at that time, Patrick Reid. The theme of Transportation and Communication led to the conglomeration of many different exhibits of transportation networks. This included a 3.5 mile [[monorail]] line that glided over the crowds that included a trip to every zone.<ref>Vancouver orders Swiss monorail ''[[Railway Age]]'' January 1985 page 49</ref> Other ground transports included the [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|SkyTrain]], a High Speed Surface Transport from Japan, and a French \"People Mover.\" The transport of the sky was the Gondola, a boxcar hovering high in the air. The water taxis moved along four different ports on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bobbea.com/expo-86/transportation.html|title=Transportation -- EXPO 86|accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe fair was awarded to Vancouver by the [[Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE) in November 1980.  However, once it became clear that the event would be a [[world exposition]], the name was officially changed to \"Expo 86\" by Ambassador and Commissioner General Patrick Reid in October 1981, and, by the end of the year, Expo 86 Corporation was established as a nonprofit agency responsible in the planning and operation of the fair. Local business tycoon [[Jim Pattison]] was appointed as CEO, and would eventually also become the president of the corporation. The chief architect selected was [[Bruno Freschi]], the Creative Director was Ron Woodall, and Bob Smith was responsible for the production and design.\n\nConstruction started in October 1983, when [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], [[Monarchy in Canada|Queen of Canada]], started a concrete mixer on the future site of the Canada Pavilion, and offered the \"invitation to the world.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bcarchives.gov.bc.ca/exhibits/jubilee/transpo.htm#pamphlet |title=Archives of British Columbia: Trains, Planes and Automobiles |access-date=2007-10-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813113128/http://www.bcarchives.gov.bc.ca/exhibits/jubilee/transpo.htm#pamphlet |archive-date=2007-08-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  However, work was disrupted by labour disputes for five months. Still, Expo Centre opened May 2, 1985, as a preview centre for the fair.\n\nThe fair was originally budgeted for a modest CAN$78 million. However, final expenditures for the expanded event totalled $802 million, with a deficit of CAN$311 million.<ref>[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0002692 Expo 86 by Kim Patrick O'Leary]</ref>\n\n====Evictions====\nAs the city prepared to welcome an influx of visitors, more than a thousand low-income residents of Vancouver's [[Downtown Eastside]] were evicted from their long-term homes in [[single room occupancy]] (SRO) hotels, sometimes with as little as a single day's notice.<ref name=\"Baker\">{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/expo-86-evictions-remembered-1.3566844|title=Expo 86 evictions: remembering the fair's dark side|last=Baker|first=Rafferty|date=5 May 2016|work=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=14 May 2016}}</ref> Because tenants were subject to British Columbia's Innkeeper's Act rather than the laws governing typical landlords and renters, the SRO owners were not required to give significant notice, or even written notice, of an eviction. [[Mike Harcourt]], the city's mayor at the time, hoped provincial laws might be changed to protect these residents, but the provincial government refused.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> The [https://www.patriciahotel.ca Patricia Hotel] was among those establishments that evicted most or all of its residents, including a Norwegian man named Olaf Solheim. Solheim, who had lived at the Patricia Hotel for decades, was well known in the community but was evicted with just a week's notice. Although he was found a new home, he became despondent, stopped eating, and died within a month. Vancouver's chief medical health officer at the time, John Batherwick, publicly asserted that the sudden eviction could be the cause of Solheim's death: \"He'd been moved from where he was to a place he didn't want to be, and he simply lost his will to live and he died.\"<ref name=\"Baker\" />\n\n===The Fair===\nExpo 86 was opened by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]] on Friday, May 2, 1986. It featured pavilions from 54 nations and numerous corporations. Expo's participants were given the opportunity to design their own pavilion or opt for the less expensive Expo module. Each module was approximately two-and-a-half stories high and had the floor space equal to a third of a city block. The design was such that any number of the square modules could be placed together in a variety of shapes. The roof design allowed the interior exhibit space to be uninterrupted by pillars.\n\nThis World's Fair was categorized as a \"Class II,\" or \"specialized exhibition,\" reflecting its specific emphases on transportation and communications.\n\n==Pavilions==\n\n===Canadian provinces and territories===\n<gallery>\nFile:ALBERTA PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Alberta}}\nFile:BRITISH COLUMBIA PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|British Columbia}}\nFile:QUEBEC PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Quebec}}\nFile:YUKON PAVILION AT 86 EXPO, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Yukon}}\nFile:NORTHWEST TERRITORIES PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Northwest Territories}}\n</gallery>\n:'''Not pictured:''' \u2022{{flag|Nova Scotia}} \u2022{{flag|Ontario}} \u2022{{flag|Prince Edward Island}} \u2022{{flag|Saskatchewan}}\n\n===Countries and international organizations===\n<gallery>\nFile:AUSTRALIAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Australia}}\nFile:BELGIAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Belgium|state}}\nFile:BRUNEI PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Brunei Darussalam}}\nFile:Canada Place Landing.jpg|{{flag|Canada}}\nFile:CHINESE PAVILION AT 86 EXOI, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|China}}\nFile:COSTA RICA PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Costa Rica|state}}\nFile:CUBAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Cuba}}\nFile:CZECHOSLOVAKIAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Czechoslovakia}}\nFile:EASTERN CARIBBEAN NATIONS PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|[[Eastern Caribbean]] Nations\nFile:EEU PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Europe|name=European Community}}\nFile:FRENCH PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|France}}\nFile:WEST GERMAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|West Germany}}\nFile:HONG KONG PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Hong Kong|1959}}\nFile:INDONESIAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Indonesia}}\nFile:ITALIAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Italy}}\nFile:JAPANESE PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Japan|1870}}\nFile:MEXICAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Mexico}}\nFile:NORWEGIAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Norway}}\nFile:PAKISTAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Pakistan}}\nFile:PERU PAVILION AT EXPO 86.

The eastern portion was used for the annual [[Molson Indy Vancouver|Molson Indy]] race, until it was cancelled in late 2004.  Future plans call for the eastern third of the site to be developed into parkland and condominiums. The western third of the site is presently owned by the real estate investment firm [[Concord Pacific Developments|Concord Pacific]], which has its primary shareholder the Hong Kong billionaire [[Li Ka-Shing]].

The first line was built intending partially to serve Expo, with construction beginning in the autumn of 1982 and revenue service opening in December 1985. SkyTrain has since become the backbone of the city's metropolitan transit system (metro) and the system has been extended six times, including three minor expansions to the original revenue line Expo Line in 1989, 1990, and 1994. Two additional metro lines, the Millennium Line and the Canada Line, were built in 2001 and 2009, respectively, with the Millennium Line being extended to Coquitlam by the [[Evergreen Extension]] in 2016. Construction of guideway, station, and train retrofitting of the entire Expo Line are underway as of 2012. Today, SkyTrain transports over 350,000 passengers daily. SkyTrain uses its original 1985-86 Expo fleet of trains (Bombardier/UTDC Mark I) as part of daily revenue service, and newer trains that have additional capacity and more advanced technology (Mark II, Mark III). \n* '''Expo Centre - [[Science World at Telus World of Science|Science World]]''' - An interactive educational centre with an [[OMNIMAX]] cinema. It opened May 2, 1986, as the Expo Centre. Between 1989 and 1990, after much public support, the building was expanded, and in late 1990, it opened to the general public as a science museum, \"Science World\". In 2005 the name was changed to ''Science World at Telus World of Science''.\n* '''[[BC Place Stadium]]''' - All-purpose domed sports stadium (primarily for the [[BC Lions]] & [[Vancouver Whitecaps]]), home of the opening of Expo 86. The stadium was also home of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, Opening and Closing Ceremonies. BC Place opened June 19, 1983. SkyTrain's [[Stadium-Chinatown Station]] (then, \"Stadium Station\") was built for this landmark in 1985, and has since served all major sporting and concert events since 1986. In May 2010, the landmark teflon roof was deflated, and it was replaced with a new retractable roof, as well as overall structural upgrades and a complete interior design makeover. BC Place reopened on September 30, 2011 as the world's largest cable-supported retractable-roof stadium.\n* '''[[Canada Place]]''' The Canada Government pavilion is now a major downtown convention centre and cruise ship docks. It has seen major use over the years and was expanded to allow for bigger cruise ships to dock in 1999. In 2009, a companion building immediately to the northwest was completed. SkyTrain's terminus [[Waterfront Station (Vancouver)|Waterfront Station]] served Canada Place in 1986. A special shuttle train between Waterfront and Stadium Station was used throughout the duration of the fair to get patrons between the Canada Pavilion and main Expo site along False Creek.\n* '''[[Plaza of Nations]]''' - This space has been used as an outdoor concert venue and public plaza with the surrounding buildings used as office space and nightclubs. Since Expo ended, the glass canopy that was connected to the adjacent office buildings was found unsafe and torn down, while in 2007 it was decided that the office buildings will be demolished. The B.C. Pavilion structure remains, and is now the site of the [[Edgewater Casino (Vancouver)|Edgewater Casino]]. Once the offices are demolished it will leave Canada Place, the B.C. Pavilion and the Telus World of Science as the only remaining structures from Expo directly left on the Expo site.\n\nAfter the fair closed, many of the attractions were auctioned off to buyers. The dispersed Expo 86 buildings include:\n\n[[File:McBarge front.jpg|thumb|right|The [[McBarge]] is currently anchored derelict in [[Burrard Inlet]] next to an oil refinery]]\n[[File:Lighthouse Pub Formerly the China Gate.jpg|thumb|right| The pub on the left was the China Gate Restaurant.

It can be seen when riding the [[West Coast Express]]. Moved to Maple Ridge, British Columbia in 2015 for refurbishment.\n* '''Space Ship McDonald's''' The spaceship motif from the restaurant was dismantled and the wings were removed. The remodelled pieces were then shipped to [[Sechelt]] and reconstructed as a lighthouse to go atop the [[Lighthouse Pub]].\n* '''China Gate''' - donated by the Chinese Government to the City of Vancouver. The landmark was relocated in 1987 to Pender Street in Vancouver's [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Chinatown]].\n* '''[[Lighthouse Pub|China Gate Cafe]]''' was dismantled and moved to [[Sechelt, BC|Sechelt BC]] and is now the home to the [[Lighthouse Pub]].\n* '''World's largest [[ice hockey]] stick''' - now in [[Duncan, British Columbia]] at the local [[Island Savings Centre|hockey rink]]\n* '''Scream Machine''' [[roller coaster]] - now [[The Ninja (roller coaster)|Ninja]] at [[Six Flags St. Louis]]\n* '''[[Spirit Catcher]]''' sculpture - now installed along the waterfront of [[Barrie, Ontario]]\n* '''[[Inukshuk]]''' - once used at the [[Northwest Territories]] Pavilion, was relocated to English Bay beach in 1988. It was an inspiration for the logo for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].\n* '''Site Furniture''' - all sorts of brightly painted remnants were relocated to the [[Pacific National Exhibition]] on East Hastings Street, and to other parks and public areas in Greater [[Vancouver]].\n* '''Folklife Pavilion''' - most of the Folklife Pavilion buildings were dismantled into pieces, shipped by barge and reconstructed as the Folklife Village, the main shopping centre on [[Gabriola Island]], BC\n* '''UFO H2O''' - the water park is now at Mount Layton Hot Springs Resort in [[Terrace, British Columbia]].\n* '''Dragon boats''' - the six teak wooden boats used to celebrate Hong Kong (pavilion) Day by holding a Dragon Boat racing festival were raced annually for a number of years before being put into dry dock.   In 2015 the original 6, plus 3 more teak and 6 Taiwanese dragon boats, were transferred to [[Salmon Arm]], BC and completely restored.\n* '''Expo building modules''' - Numerous former pavilion structures were disassembled and reconstructed, largely for industrial use throughout the Lower Mainland, and few have survived to 2013. They can be identified by their distinctive peaked corners with exposed tubular girders.

She recovered quickly in the washroom, and left half an hour later. Prince Charles later said that her fainting spell was a result of heat and exhaustion. However, the Princess confessed several years later that it was actually caused by not having kept down any food for several days, the result of her eating disorder. She was chastised by her husband for not \"fainting gracefully behind a door.\"\n\nOn May 9, 1986, 9-year-old Karen Ford of Nanaimo, BC died at the Canadian Pavilion.

The fair, the theme of which was \"Transportation and Communication: World in Motion - World in Touch\", coincided with Vancouver's centennial and was held on the north shore of False Creek. It was the second time that Canada held a World's Fair, the first being [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]] (during the [[Canadian Centennial]]).  It was also the third World's Fair to be held in the Pacific Northwest in the previous 24 years as of 1986 and as of 2020 it still stands as the last World's Fair to be held in North America.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Expo 86 - monorail.jpg|thumb|The monorail at Expo 86. After the site closed, it was shipped to [[England]] where it was installed at the [[Alton Towers]] [[theme park]] in 1987.]]\nThe logo of three interlocking rings to make the 86 in the logo stood for the three main modes of transportation; land, air, and water.\n\n===Background===\nUp until the late 1970s, the 173 acre (0.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) site on [[False Creek]], where Expo was staged, was a former [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] rail yard and an industrial wasteland.  In 1978, [[Sam Bawlf]] (then BC Minister of Recreation and Conservation) proposed an exposition to celebrate Vancouver's centennial year (1986). The proposal was submitted in June 1979, for a fair that was to be called \"Transpo 86.\" In 1980, the British Columbia Legislature passed the Transpo 86 Corporation Act, paving the way for the fair.  The transportation theme reflected the city's role in connecting Canada by rail, its status as a major port and transportation hub, and the role of transportation in communications.\n\nThe initial idea was to have \"...a modest $80 million transportation exposition that would mark Vancouver's 100th anniversary.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Peter Stoler|first=Rudolph, Barbara |author= |authorlink= |date=28 April 1986 |title= Westward Ho to Expo 86|trans-title=|magazine=Time Magazine|volume= |series= |issue= |page= |pages= |at= |chapter= |location= |publisher= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |language= |id= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |doi= |accessdate=1 November 2011 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961308-2,00.html }}</ref> It soon blossomed into a full exposition thanks to the help of the Vancouver Exposition Commissioner-General at that time, Patrick Reid. The theme of Transportation and Communication led to the conglomeration of many different exhibits of transportation networks. This included a 3.5 mile [[monorail]] line that glided over the crowds that included a trip to every zone.<ref>Vancouver orders Swiss monorail ''[[Railway Age]]'' January 1985 page 49</ref> Other ground transports included the [[Expo Line (SkyTrain)|SkyTrain]], a High Speed Surface Transport from Japan, and a French \"People Mover.\" The transport of the sky was the Gondola, a boxcar hovering high in the air. The water taxis moved along four different ports on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bobbea.com/expo-86/transportation.html|title=Transportation -- EXPO 86|accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe fair was awarded to Vancouver by the [[Bureau International des Expositions]] (BIE) in November 1980.  However, once it became clear that the event would be a [[world exposition]], the name was officially changed to \"Expo 86\" by Ambassador and Commissioner General Patrick Reid in October 1981, and, by the end of the year, Expo 86 Corporation was established as a nonprofit agency responsible in the planning and operation of the fair. Local business tycoon [[Jim Pattison]] was appointed as CEO, and would eventually also become the president of the corporation. The chief architect selected was [[Bruno Freschi]], the Creative Director was Ron Woodall, and Bob Smith was responsible for the production and design.\n\nConstruction started in October 1983, when [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], [[Monarchy in Canada|Queen of Canada]], started a concrete mixer on the future site of the Canada Pavilion, and offered the \"invitation to the world.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bcarchives.gov.bc.ca/exhibits/jubilee/transpo.htm#pamphlet |title=Archives of British Columbia: Trains, Planes and Automobiles |access-date=2007-10-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813113128/http://www.bcarchives.gov.bc.ca/exhibits/jubilee/transpo.htm#pamphlet |archive-date=2007-08-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  However, work was disrupted by labour disputes for five months. Still, Expo Centre opened May 2, 1985, as a preview centre for the fair.\n\nThe fair was originally budgeted for a modest CAN$78 million.

[[Mike Harcourt]], the city's mayor at the time, hoped provincial laws might be changed to protect these residents, but the provincial government refused.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> The [https://www.patriciahotel.ca Patricia Hotel] was among those establishments that evicted most or all of its residents, including a Norwegian man named Olaf Solheim. Solheim, who had lived at the Patricia Hotel for decades, was well known in the community but was evicted with just a week's notice. Although he was found a new home, he became despondent, stopped eating, and died within a month. Vancouver's chief medical health officer at the time, John Batherwick, publicly asserted that the sudden eviction could be the cause of Solheim's death: \"He'd been moved from where he was to a place he didn't want to be, and he simply lost his will to live and he died.\"<ref name=\"Baker\" />\n\n===The Fair===\nExpo 86 was opened by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]] on Friday, May 2, 1986. It featured pavilions from 54 nations and numerous corporations. Expo's participants were given the opportunity to design their own pavilion or opt for the less expensive Expo module. Each module was approximately two-and-a-half stories high and had the floor space equal to a third of a city block. The design was such that any number of the square modules could be placed together in a variety of shapes. The roof design allowed the interior exhibit space to be uninterrupted by pillars.\n\nThis World's Fair was categorized as a \"Class II,\" or \"specialized exhibition,\" reflecting its specific emphases on transportation and communications.\n\n==Pavilions==\n\n===Canadian provinces and territories===\n<gallery>\nFile:ALBERTA PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Alberta}}\nFile:BRITISH COLUMBIA PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|British Columbia}}\nFile:QUEBEC PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Quebec}}\nFile:YUKON PAVILION AT 86 EXPO, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Yukon}}\nFile:NORTHWEST TERRITORIES PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Northwest Territories}}\n</gallery>\n:'''Not pictured:''' \u2022{{flag|Nova Scotia}} \u2022{{flag|Ontario}} \u2022{{flag|Prince Edward Island}} \u2022{{flag|Saskatchewan}}\n\n===Countries and international organizations===\n<gallery>\nFile:AUSTRALIAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Australia}}\nFile:BELGIAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Belgium|state}}\nFile:BRUNEI PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Brunei Darussalam}}\nFile:Canada Place Landing.jpg|{{flag|Canada}}\nFile:CHINESE PAVILION AT 86 EXOI, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|China}}\nFile:COSTA RICA PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Costa Rica|state}}\nFile:CUBAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Cuba}}\nFile:CZECHOSLOVAKIAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Czechoslovakia}}\nFile:EASTERN CARIBBEAN NATIONS PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|[[Eastern Caribbean]] Nations\nFile:EEU PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Europe|name=European Community}}\nFile:FRENCH PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|France}}\nFile:WEST GERMAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|West Germany}}\nFile:HONG KONG PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Hong Kong|1959}}\nFile:INDONESIAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Indonesia}}\nFile:ITALIAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Italy}}\nFile:JAPANESE PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Japan|1870}}\nFile:MEXICAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Mexico}}\nFile:NORWEGIAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Norway}}\nFile:PAKISTAN PAVILION AT EXPO 86, VANCOUVER, B.C..jpg|{{flag|Pakistan}}\nFile:PERU PAVILION AT EXPO 86.

It remains to date the second biggest event in [[British Columbia]] history and is viewed by many as the transition of [[Vancouver]] from a sleepy provincial backwater to a city with global clout.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} It marked a strong boost to tourism for the province.\n\nMany{{who|date=November 2011}} have also seen the fair as being at least partially responsible for the re-election of the [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit]] party for its final term as a provincial government.\n\nToday, the western half of the site has and is continuing to be developed into parks and high rise [[condominium]]s. The eastern portion was used for the annual [[Molson Indy Vancouver|Molson Indy]] race, until it was cancelled in late 2004.  Future plans call for the eastern third of the site to be developed into parkland and condominiums. The western third of the site is presently owned by the real estate investment firm [[Concord Pacific Developments|Concord Pacific]], which has its primary shareholder the Hong Kong billionaire [[Li Ka-Shing]].

The first line was built intending partially to serve Expo, with construction beginning in the autumn of 1982 and revenue service opening in December 1985. SkyTrain has since become the backbone of the city's metropolitan transit system (metro) and the system has been extended six times, including three minor expansions to the original revenue line Expo Line in 1989, 1990, and 1994. Two additional metro lines, the Millennium Line and the Canada Line, were built in 2001 and 2009, respectively, with the Millennium Line being extended to Coquitlam by the [[Evergreen Extension]] in 2016. Construction of guideway, station, and train retrofitting of the entire Expo Line are underway as of 2012. Today, SkyTrain transports over 350,000 passengers daily. SkyTrain uses its original 1985-86 Expo fleet of trains (Bombardier/UTDC Mark I) as part of daily revenue service, and newer trains that have additional capacity and more advanced technology (Mark II, Mark III). \n* '''Expo Centre - [[Science World at Telus World of Science|Science World]]''' - An interactive educational centre with an [[OMNIMAX]] cinema. It opened May 2, 1986, as the Expo Centre. Between 1989 and 1990, after much public support, the building was expanded, and in late 1990, it opened to the general public as a science museum, \"Science World\". In 2005 the name was changed to ''Science World at Telus World of Science''.\n* '''[[BC Place Stadium]]''' - All-purpose domed sports stadium (primarily for the [[BC Lions]] & [[Vancouver Whitecaps]]), home of the opening of Expo 86. The stadium was also home of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games, Opening and Closing Ceremonies. BC Place opened June 19, 1983. SkyTrain's [[Stadium-Chinatown Station]] (then, \"Stadium Station\") was built for this landmark in 1985, and has since served all major sporting and concert events since 1986. In May 2010, the landmark teflon roof was deflated, and it was replaced with a new retractable roof, as well as overall structural upgrades and a complete interior design makeover. BC Place reopened on September 30, 2011 as the world's largest cable-supported retractable-roof stadium.\n* '''[[Canada Place]]''' The Canada Government pavilion is now a major downtown convention centre and cruise ship docks. It has seen major use over the years and was expanded to allow for bigger cruise ships to dock in 1999. In 2009, a companion building immediately to the northwest was completed. SkyTrain's terminus [[Waterfront Station (Vancouver)|Waterfront Station]] served Canada Place in 1986. A special shuttle train between Waterfront and Stadium Station was used throughout the duration of the fair to get patrons between the Canada Pavilion and main Expo site along False Creek.\n* '''[[Plaza of Nations]]''' - This space has been used as an outdoor concert venue and public plaza with the surrounding buildings used as office space and nightclubs. Since Expo ended, the glass canopy that was connected to the adjacent office buildings was found unsafe and torn down, while in 2007 it was decided that the office buildings will be demolished. The B.C. Pavilion structure remains, and is now the site of the [[Edgewater Casino (Vancouver)|Edgewater Casino]]. Once the offices are demolished it will leave Canada Place, the B.C. Pavilion and the Telus World of Science as the only remaining structures from Expo directly left on the Expo site.\n\nAfter the fair closed, many of the attractions were auctioned off to buyers. The dispersed Expo 86 buildings include:\n\n[[File:McBarge front.jpg|thumb|right|The [[McBarge]] is currently anchored derelict in [[Burrard Inlet]] next to an oil refinery]]\n[[File:Lighthouse Pub Formerly the China Gate.jpg|thumb|right| The pub on the left was the China Gate Restaurant. The lighthouse on the right was a spaceship atop a McDonald's. It is now the [[Lighthouse Pub]] in [[Sechelt|Sechelt BC]]]]\n\n* '''[[Monorail]]''' - now located at [[Alton Towers]] Theme Park in England\n* '''[[McBarge]]''' (officially ''Friendship 500'') - a floating [[McDonald's]] has been abandoned in the waters of [[Burrard Inlet]], Burnaby (locally known as \"McDerelict\"). It can be seen when riding the [[West Coast Express]]. Moved to Maple Ridge, British Columbia in 2015 for refurbishment.\n* '''Space Ship McDonald's''' The spaceship motif from the restaurant was dismantled and the wings were removed. The remodelled pieces were then shipped to [[Sechelt]] and reconstructed as a lighthouse to go atop the [[Lighthouse Pub]].\n* '''China Gate''' - donated by the Chinese Government to the City of Vancouver. The landmark was relocated in 1987 to Pender Street in Vancouver's [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Chinatown]].\n* '''[[Lighthouse Pub|China Gate Cafe]]''' was dismantled and moved to [[Sechelt, BC|Sechelt BC]] and is now the home to the [[Lighthouse Pub]].\n* '''World's largest [[ice hockey]] stick''' - now in [[Duncan, British Columbia]] at the local [[Island Savings Centre|hockey rink]]\n* '''Scream Machine''' [[roller coaster]] - now [[The Ninja (roller coaster)|Ninja]] at [[Six Flags St. Louis]]\n* '''[[Spirit Catcher]]''' sculpture - now installed along the waterfront of [[Barrie, Ontario]]\n* '''[[Inukshuk]]''' - once used at the [[Northwest Territories]] Pavilion, was relocated to English Bay beach in 1988. It was an inspiration for the logo for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].\n* '''Site Furniture''' - all sorts of brightly painted remnants were relocated to the [[Pacific National Exhibition]] on East Hastings Street, and to other parks and public areas in Greater [[Vancouver]].\n* '''Folklife Pavilion''' - most of the Folklife Pavilion buildings were dismantled into pieces, shipped by barge and reconstructed as the Folklife Village, the main shopping centre on [[Gabriola Island]], BC\n* '''UFO H2O''' - the water park is now at Mount Layton Hot Springs Resort in [[Terrace, British Columbia]].\n* '''Dragon boats''' - the six teak wooden boats used to celebrate Hong Kong (pavilion) Day by holding a Dragon Boat racing festival were raced annually for a number of years before being put into dry dock.   In 2015 the original 6, plus 3 more teak and 6 Taiwanese dragon boats, were transferred to [[Salmon Arm]], BC and completely restored.\n* '''Expo building modules''' - Numerous former pavilion structures were disassembled and reconstructed, largely for industrial use throughout the Lower Mainland, and few have survived to 2013. They can be identified by their distinctive peaked corners with exposed tubular girders. They can be found at Tillbury Industrial Park in [[Delta, British Columbia]].\n* '''Russian Pavilion''' - The Russian Pavilion had a special roof designed with triangles which allowed for maximum floor space coverage without any beams coming down to support it save for the outside of the building.  It was dismantled and relocated now housing machinery at the Kruger Products paper plant in [[New Westminster|New Westminster British Columbia]].\n* '''Bench Seating''' - iconic painted wire grid bench seating, coloured as the different zone colours of the fair, with formed concrete bases and the \"86\" logo branded into the sides, can be seen at various locales around the Greater Vancouver area, notably along the [[White Rock, British Columbia|White Rock]] beach promenade.\n* '''Log Flume Ride''' - shipped across Canada on 16 large trucks and installed at [[Upper Clements Parks]] in the [[Annapolis Valley]], [[Nova Scotia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Upper Clements Park|url=http://www.annapolis-valley-vacation.com/upper-clements-park.html|website=Annapolis Valley Vacation|accessdate=6 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106074600/http://www.annapolis-valley-vacation.com/upper-clements-park.html|archive-date=6 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* '''Pier''' A large steel pier constructed for use during Expo is now in use on the north side of [[Keats Island (British Columbia)|Keats Island]] as the main dock for Barnabas Landing.

Premier [[William Vander Zalm]] and [[Peter Toigo]] were accused of [[influence peddling]] in the sale.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n==Accidents==\nWhile opening the World's Fair, Diana, Princess of Wales briefly fainted onto her husband in a crowded hall in the California Pavilion. She recovered quickly in the washroom, and left half an hour later. Prince Charles later said that her fainting spell was a result of heat and exhaustion. However, the Princess confessed several years later that it was actually caused by not having kept down any food for several days, the result of her eating disorder. She was chastised by her husband for not \"fainting gracefully behind a door.\"\n\nOn May 9, 1986, 9-year-old Karen Ford of Nanaimo, BC died at the Canadian Pavilion.  She was crushed while on a revolving turntable that connected two semi-circular theatres in the pavilion.  The revolving table was shut down for some time after the accident, but was put back in service with a number of new safety measures.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2rASAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4918%2C969997 Victim's father wants $100,000 from Expo, Associated Press, Spokane Chronicle - Jun 19, 1986, pg A2]</ref>\n\n==In popular media==\n*The Vancouver-based indie band [[Said the Whale]] recorded a song called \"False Creek Change\" about the changes that Expo 86 brought to the area.
