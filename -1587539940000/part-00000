It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a [[infection|communicable disease]], but do not have a confirmed [[medical diagnosis]]. It is distinct from [[Isolation (health care)|medical isolation]], in which those confirmed to be infected with a communicable disease are isolated from the healthy population. Quarantine considerations are often one aspect of [[border control]]. \n\nThis is a catastrophic thing that makes fat cats very sad. The concept of quarantine has been known since biblical times, and is known to have been practised through history in various places. Notable quarantines in modern history include that of the village of [[Eyam]] in 1665 during the [[bubonic plague]] outbreak in England; [[American Samoa|East Samoa]] during the [[Spanish flu|1918 flu pandemic]]; the [[1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak]], and extensive quarantines applied throughout the world during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nEthical and practical considerations need to be considered when applying quarantine to people. Practice differs from country to country. In some countries, quarantine is just one of many measures governed by legislation relating to the broader concept of [[biosecurity]]; for example [[biosecurity in Australia|Australian biosecurity]] is governed by the single overarching ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]''.\n\n==Etymology and terminology ==\nThe word ''quarantine'' comes from ''quarantena'', meaning \"forty days\", used in the 14th-15th-century [[Venetian language]] and designating the period that all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the [[Black Death]] plague [[epidemic]]; it followed the ''trentino'', or thirty-day isolation period, first imposed in 1377 in the [[Republic of Ragusa]], [[Dalmatia]] (modern [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia).<ref name=\"JSM17\"/><ref name=\"Eccles\">{{cite book|editor1=Ronald Eccles|editor2=Olaf Weber|title=Common cold|year=2009|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|location=Basel|isbn=978-3-7643-9894-1|pages=210|edition=Online-Ausg.}}</ref><ref name=\"Mayer\">{{cite web |first= Johanna |last= Mayer |title= The Origin Of The Word 'Quarantine' |date=4 September 2018 |url= https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/the-origin-of-the-word-quarantine/ |access-date=17 March 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"EID2013\">{{cite journal|doi=10.3201/eid1902.ET1902|title=Etymologia: Quarantine|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=263|doi-access=free}}</ref> \n\n[[Merriam-Webster]] gives various meanings to the noun form, including \"a period of 40 days\", several relating to ships, \"a state of enforced isolation\", and as \"a restriction on the [[Freedom of movement|movement of people]] and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of [[disease]] or [[Pest (organism)|pests]]\".

Those afflicted with [[leprosy]] were historically isolated long-term from society, and attempts were made to check the spread of [[syphilis]] in northern Europe after 1492, the advent of [[yellow fever]] in Spain at the beginning of the 19th century, and the arrival of Asiatic [[cholera]] in 1831.\n\n[[Republic of Venice|Venice]] took the lead in measures to check the spread of plague, having appointed three guardians of public health in the first years of the Black Death (1348).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.21061/vtuhr.v2i0.16|title=A Brief History of Quarantine|year=2013|last1=Drews|first1=Kelly|journal=The Virginia Tech Undergraduate Historical Review|volume=2|doi-access=free}}</ref> The next record of preventive measures comes from [[Reggio Emilia| Reggio]]/[[Modena]] in 1374.

The great lazaret of Marseille, perhaps the most complete of its kind, was founded in 1526 on the island of [[Frioul archipelago |Pom\u00e8gues]]. The practice at all the Mediterranean lazarets did not differ from the English procedure in the Levantine and North African trade.

All but that of 1897 were concerned with [[cholera]]. No result came of those at Paris (1852), Constantinople (1866), Vienna (1874), and Rome (1885), but each of the subsequent ones doctrine of constructive infection of a ship as coming from a scheduled port, and an approximation to the principles advocated by Great Britain for many years. The principal countries which retained the old system at the time were Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece and Russia (the British possessions at the time, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus, being under the same influence). The aim of each international sanitary convention had been to bind the governments to a uniform minimum of preventive action, with further restrictions permissible to individual countries. The minimum specified by international conventions was very nearly the same as the British practice, which had been in turn adapted to continental opinion in the matter of the importation of rags.\n\nThe Venice convention of 30 January 1892 dealt with cholera by the [[Suez Canal]] route; that of Dresden of 15 April 1893, with cholera within European countries; that of Paris of 3 April 1894, with cholera by the pilgrim traffic; and that of Venice, on 19 March 1897, was in connection with the outbreak of plague in the East, and the conference met to settle on an international basis the steps to be taken to prevent, if possible, its spread into Europe. An additional convention was signed in Paris on 3 December 1903.<ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 Text of the 1903 convention] British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, ''www.fco.gov.uk'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926134555/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 |date=26 September 2012}}, accessed 5 February 2020</ref>\n\nA multilateral international sanitary convention was concluded at Paris on 17 January 1912.<ref>Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 4, pp. 282\u2013413.</ref> This convention was most comprehensive and was designated to replace all previous conventions on that matter.

It was admitted that the incubation period was, as a rule, a comparatively short one, namely, of some three or four days. After much discussion ten days was accepted by a very large majority. The principle of [[disease notification]] was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify to other governments on the existence of plague within their several jurisdictions, and at the same time state the measures of prevention which are being carried out to prevent its diffusion. The area deemed to be infected was limited to the actual district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected merely because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no diffusion of the malady. As regards the precautions to be taken on land frontiers, it was decided that during the prevalence of plague every country had the inherent right to close its land frontiers against traffic. As regards the [[Red Sea]], it was decided after discussion that a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal, and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the period of incubation of the disease the prevention of which is in question. It was also agreed that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal in quarantine at Port Said by night as well as by day, and that passengers might embark in quarantine at that port. Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and are provided with a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal, in quarantine, subject only to the landing of those who were suffering from plague.\n\n====21st century====\nIn the 21st century, people suspected of carrying infectious diseases have been quarantined, as in the cases of [[Andrew Speaker]] (multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, 2007) and [[Kaci Hickox]] (Ebola, 2014). Moving infected patients to [[isolation ward]]s and home-based self-quarantine of people potentially exposed was the main way the [[Western African Ebola virus epidemic]] was ended in 2016; members of the 8th [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Emergency Committee criticised international travel restrictions imposed during the epidemic as ineffective due to difficulty of enforcement, and counterproductive as they slowed down aid efforts.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2015/ihr-ebola-8th-meeting/en/|title=Statement on the 8th meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee regarding the Ebola outbreak in West Africa|author=|date=|publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> The [[People's Republic of China]] has employed mass quarantines - firstly of the city of [[Wuhan]] and subsequently of all of [[Hubei]] province (population 55.5 million) - in the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].

It is sometimes called the \"yellow jack\" but this was also a name for [[yellow fever]], which probably derives its common name from the flag, not the colour of the victims (cholera ships also used a yellow flag).<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Sehdev PS|title=The origin of quarantine|journal=[[Clinical Infectious Diseases]]|date=1 November 2002|volume=35|issue=9|pages=1071\u20132|doi=10.1086/344062|pmid=12398064|doi-access=free}}</ref> The plain [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] (\"Quebec\" or '''Q''' in [[international maritime signal flags]]) probably derives its letter symbol for its initial use in ''quarantine'', but this flag in modern times indicates the opposite\u2014a ship that 'requests free [[pratique]]', i.e. that declares itself free of quarantinable disease, and requests boarding and routine port inspection.<ref>[http://flagspot.net/flags/xf~q.html Quarantine Flag history] ''flagspot.net'', accessed 2 February 2020</ref>\n\n==Ethical and practical considerations==\nThe quarantining of people often raises questions of [[civil rights]], especially in cases of long confinement or segregation from society, such as that of [[Mary Mallon]] (also known as Typhoid Mary), a [[typhoid fever]] [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]] who was arrested and quarantined in 1907 and later spent the last 23 years and 7 months of her life in medical isolation at Riverside Hospital on [[North and South Brother Islands, New York City#North Brother Island|North Brother Island]].<ref>[http://broadstreetonline.org/2015/02/typhoid-mary-and-the-publics-right-to-health/ \"Typhoid Mary and the Public's Right to Health,\"] ''Broad Street Magazine,'' 16 February 2015, 12:37 pm</ref><ref>[http://time.com/3474945/politics-quarantines-typhoid-mary-ebola/ Mary Beth Keane, \"The History of Quarantine Is the History of Discrimination,\"] 6 October 2014 ''Time Magazine,'', accessed 5 February 2020</ref>\n\n===The United Nations and the Siracusa Principles===\nGuidance on when and how human rights can be restricted to prevent the spread of infectious disease is found in The Siracusa Principles, a non-binding document developed by the [[Siracusa International Institute for Criminal Justice and Human Rights]] and adopted by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] in 1984.<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4672bc122.html United Nations Economic and Social Council UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, \"The Siracusa Principles on the limitation and derogation provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\" Section I.A.12 UN Doc.

Limitations on rights (such as quarantine) must be 'strictly necessary,' meaning that they must: \n* respond to a pressing public or social need (health)\n* [[Proportionality (law)|proportionately]] pursue a legitimate aim (prevent the spread of infectious disease)\n* be the [[least restrictive means]] required for achieving the purpose of the limitation\n* be provided for and carried out in accordance with the law\n* be neither arbitrary nor discriminatory\n* only limit rights that are within the jurisdiction of the state seeking to impose the limitation.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 4463097|year = 2013|last1 = Todrys|first1 = K.

These include [[post-traumatic stress]], confusion and anger.  According to a \"Rapid Review\" published in [[The Lancet]] in response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], \"Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.\"<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8|title=The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: Rapid review of the evidence|year=2020|last1=Brooks|first1=Samantha K.|last2=Webster|first2=Rebecca K.|last3=Smith|first3=Louise E.|last4=Woodland|first4=Lisa|last5=Wessely|first5=Simon|last6=Greenberg|first6=Neil|last7=Rubin|first7=Gideon James|journal=The Lancet|volume=395|issue=10227|pages=912\u2013920|pmid=32112714|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Short-term quarantines, e.g. for decontamination===\nQuarantine periods can be very short, such as in the case of a suspected [[anthrax]] attack, in which people are allowed to leave as soon as they shed their potentially contaminated garments and undergo a [[decontamination]] shower. For example, an article entitled \"Daily News workers quarantined\" describes a brief quarantine that lasted until people could be showered in a decontamination tent.<ref>[https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Anthrax-scare-temporarily-closes-Midland-Daily-7020034.php Kelly Nankervis: Anthrax scare temporarily closes Midland Daily News] ''Daily News/ www.ourmidland.com''</ref>\n\nThe February/March 2003 issue of ''HazMat Magazine'' suggests that people be \"locked in a room until proper decon could be performed\", in the event of \"suspect anthrax\".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n''[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|Standard-Times]]'' senior correspondent Steve Urbon (14 February 2003) describes such temporary quarantine powers:\n<blockquote>\nCivil rights activists in some cases have objected to people being rounded up, stripped and showered against their will. But Capt. Chmiel said local health authorities have \"certain powers to quarantine people\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tognotti|first1=E.|title=Lessons from the history of quarantine, from plague to influenza A.|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=19|issue=2|pages=254\u2013259|doi=10.3201/eid1902.120312|pmid=23343512|pmc=3559034|year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Qureshi|first1=Adnan|title=Ebola Virus Disease: From Origin to Outbreak|date=2016|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=978-0128042304|page=62}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe purpose of such quarantine-for-decontamination is to prevent the spread of contamination and to contain the contamination such that others are not put at risk from a person fleeing a scene where contamination is suspect. It can also be used to limit exposure, as well as eliminate a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]].\n\nNew developments for quarantine include new concepts in quarantine vehicles such as the [[ambulance bus]], mobile hospitals, and lockdown/invacuation (inverse evacuation) procedures, as well as docking stations for an ambulance bus to dock to a facility under lockdown.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Standard quarantine practices in different countries==\n{{Globalize|section|the English-speaking world|date=February 2020}}\n===Australia===\n{{further|Biosecurity in Australia}}\nBiosecurity in Australia is governed by the ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]''. The [[Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service]] (AQIS) is responsible for border inspection of products brought into Australia, and assesses the risks the products might harm Australian environment. No person, goods and vessels are permitted into Australia without clearance from AQIS. Visitors are required to fill in the information card on arriving in Australia. Besides other risk factors, visitors are required to declare what food and products made of wood and other natural materials they have. Visitors who fail to do so may be subject to a fine of A$220, or may face criminal prosecution and be fined up to A$100,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nAustralia has very strict quarantine standards. Quarantine in northern Australia is especially important because of its proximity to South-East Asia and the Pacific, which have many pests and diseases not present in Australia. For this reason, the region from Cairns to Broome\u2014including the [[Torres Strait]]\u2014is the focus for quarantine activities that protect all Australians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/about/public-awareness |title=Public Awareness and Education |accessdate=27 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405091101/http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/about/public-awareness |archivedate=5 April 2013  }}</ref> As Australia has been geographically isolated from other major continents for millions of years, there is an endemically unique ecosystem free of several severe pests and diseases that are present in many parts of the world.<ref name=\"daff\">{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/biosecurity/quarantine|title=Quarantine in Australia - Department of Agriculture|publisher=daff.gov.au|accessdate=14 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713013953/http://daff.gov.au/biosecurity/quarantine|archive-date=13 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> If other products are brought inside along with pests and diseases, it would damage the ecosystem seriously and add millions of costs in the local agricultural businesses.<ref name=\"australia\">{{cite web|title=Australian Quarantine a shared responsibility: The Government response|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity/australia/reports-pubs/nairn/govt-response|website=Australian Government|publisher=Department of Primary Industries and Energy|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThere are three quarantine [[Acts of Parliament]] in Canada: ''Quarantine Act'' (humans) and ''Health of Animals Act'' (animals) and ''Plant Protection Act'' (vegetations). The first legislation is enforced by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] after a complete rewrite in 2005. The second and third legislations are enforced by the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]. If a health emergency exists, the Governor in Council can prohibit importation of anything that it deems necessary under the ''Quarantine Act''.\n\nUnder the ''Quarantine Act'', all travellers must submit to screening and if they believe they might have come into contact with [[communicable disease]]s or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], they must disclose their whereabouts to a [[Border Services Officer]]. If the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller is or might have been infected with a communicable disease or refused to provide answers, a quarantine officer (QO) must be called and the person is to be isolated. If a person refuses to be isolated, any [[peace officer]] may arrest without warrant.\n\nA QO who has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller has or might have a communicable disease or is infested with vectors, after the medical examination of a traveller, can order him/her into treatment or measures to prevent the person from spreading the disease. QO can detain any traveller who refuses to comply with his/her orders or undergo health assessments as required by law.\n\nUnder the ''Health of Animals Act'' and ''Plant Protection Act'', inspectors can prohibit access to an infected area, dispose or treat any infected or suspected to be infected animals or plants. The Minister can order for compensation to be given if animals/plants were destroyed pursuant to these acts.\n\nEach province also enacts its own quarantine/environmental health legislation.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nUnder the ''Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance'' (HK Laws. Chap 599), a health officer may seize articles they believe to be infectious or containing infectious agents. All travellers, if requested, must submit themselves to a health officer. Failure to do so is against the law and is subject to arrest and prosecution.\n\nThe law allows for a health officer who have reasonable grounds to detain, isolate, quarantine anyone or anything believed to be infected and to restrict any articles from leaving a designated quarantine area. He/she may also order the Civil Aviation Department to prohibit the landing or leaving, embarking or disembarking of an aircraft. This power also extends to land, sea or air crossings.\n\nUnder the same ordinance, any police officer, health officer, member of the [[Civil Aid Service]], or member of the [[Auxiliary Medical Service]] can arrest a person who obstructs or escapes from detention.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nTo reduce the risk of introducing [[rabies]] from continental Europe, the United Kingdom used to require that dogs, and most other animals introduced to the country, spend six months in quarantine at an [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|HM Customs and Excise]] pound; this policy was abolished in 2000 in favour of a scheme generally known as [[Pet Passports]], where animals can avoid quarantine if they have documentation showing they are up to date on their appropriate [[vaccine|vaccinations]].<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad#countries-and-territories Bringing your pet dog, cat or ferret to the UK] ''www.gov.uk'', accessed 27 January 2020</ref>\n\n====British maritime quarantine rules 1711\u20131896====\nThe plague had disappeared from England for more than thirty years before the practice of quarantine against it was definitely established by the Quarantine Act 1710 (''[[9 Ann.]]'') The first act was called for due to fears that the plague might be imported from Poland and the [[Baltic states]]. The second act of 1721 was due to the prevalence of plague at [[Marseille]] and other places in [[Provence, France]]. It was renewed in 1733 after a new outbreak in [[continental Europe]], and again in 1743, due to an epidemic in [[Messina]]. In 1752 a rigorous quarantine clause was introduced into an act regulating trade with [[the Levant]], and various arbitrary orders were issued during the next twenty years to meet the supposed danger of infection from the Baltic states. Although no plague cases ever came to England during that period, the restrictions on traffic became more stringent, and in 1788 a very strict Quarantine Act was passed, with provisions affecting cargoes in particular. The act was revised in 1801 and 1805, and in 1823\u201324 an elaborate inquiry was followed by an act making quarantine only at discretion of the [[privy council]], which recognised yellow fever or other highly infectious diseases as calling for quarantine, along with plague. The threat of cholera in 1831 was the last occasion in England of the use of quarantine restrictions. Cholera affected every country in Europe despite all efforts to keep it out. When cholera returned to England in 1849, 1853 and 1865\u201366, no attempt was made to seal the ports. In 1847 the privy council ordered all arrivals with a clean [[bill of health]] from the [[Black Sea]] and the Levant to be admitted, provided there had been no case of plague during the voyage, and afterwards the practice of quarantine was discontinued.<ref name=Booker>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7OoDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT5&lpg=PT5&dq= John Booker, ''Maritime Quarantine: The British Experience, c.1650\u20131900,'' in ''The History of Medicine in Context,'' Routledge, 2016.]{{ISBN|1351919849}} ''books.google.com'', accessed 6 February 2020</ref>\n\nAfter the passing of the first Quarantine Act (1710) the protective practices in England were haphazard and arbitrary. In 1721 two vessels carrying cotton goods from Cyprus, then affected by the plague, were ordered to be burned with their cargoes, the owners receiving an [[indemnity]]. By the clause in the Levant Trade Act of 1752, ships arriving in the United Kingdom with a \"foul bill\" (i.e. coming from a country where plague existed) had to return to the [[lazaret]]s of Malta, Venice, Messina, Livorno, Genoa or Marseille, to complete a quarantine or to have their cargoes opened and aired. Since 1741 [[Stangate]] Creek (on the [[Medway]]) had been the quarantine station but it was available only for vessels with clean bills of health. In 1755 lazarets in the form of [[Hulk (ship type)|floating hulks]] were established in England for the first time, the cleansing of cargo (particularly by exposure to [[dew]]s) having been done previously on the ship's deck. No medical inspections were conducted, but control was the responsibility of the Officers of [[Customs|Royal Customs]] and quarantine. In 1780, when plague was in Poland, even vessels with grain from the Baltic had to spend forty days in quarantine, and unpack and air their cargoes, but due to complaints mainly from Edinburgh and Leith, an exception was made for grain after that date. About 1788 an order of the council required every ship liable to quarantine to hoist a [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] in the daytime and show a light at the main topmast head at night, in case of meeting any vessel at sea, or upon arriving within four [[league (unit)|leagues]] of the coast of Great Britain or Ireland.<ref name=Booker/>\n\nAfter 1800, ships from plague-affected countries (or with foul bills) were permitted to complete their quarantine in the Medway instead of at a Mediterranean port on the way, and an extensive lazaret was built on Chetney Hill near [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] (although it was later demolished). The use of floating hulks as lazarets continued as before. In 1800 two ships with [[hide (skin)|hides]] from [[Mogador]] in Morocco were ordered to be sunk with their cargoes at the [[Nore]], the owners receiving an indemnity. Animal hides were suspected of harbouring infections, along with a long list of other items, and these had to be exposed on the ship's deck for twenty-one days or less (six days for each instalment of the cargo), and then transported to the lazaret, where they were opened and aired for another forty days. The whole detention of the vessel was from sixty to sixty-five days, including the time for reshipment of her cargo. Pilots had to pass fifteen days on board a convalescent ship. From 1846 onwards the quarantine establishments in the United Kingdom were gradually reduced, while the last vestige of the British quarantine law was removed by the [[Public Health Act]] of 1896, which repealed the Quarantine Act of 1825 (with dependent clauses of other acts), and transferred from the privy council to the [[Local Government Board]] the powers to deal with ships arriving infected with yellow fever or plague. The powers to deal with cholera ships had been already transferred by the [[Public Health Act 1875]].<ref name=Booker/>\n\nBritish regulations of 9 November 1896 applied to [[yellow fever]], [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and [[cholera]]. Officers of the Customs, as well as of [[Coast Guard|Royal Coast Guard]] and the [[Board of Trade]] (for signalling), were empowered to take the initial steps. They certified in writing the master of a supposedly infected ship, and detained the vessel provisionally for not more than twelve hours, giving notice meanwhile to the [[Port authority|port sanitary authority]]. The medical officer of the port boarded the ship and examined every person in it. Every person found infected was taken to a hospital and quarantined under the orders of the medical officer, and the vessel remained under his orders. Every person suspected could be detained on board for 48 hours or removed to the hospital for a similar period. All others were free to land upon giving the addresses of their destinations to be sent to the respective local authorities, so that the dispersed passengers and crew could be kept individually under observation for a few days. The ship was then disinfected, dead bodies buried at sea, infected clothing, bedding, etc., destroyed or disinfected, and [[bilge-water]] and [[Sailing ballast|water-ballast]] pumped out at a suitable distance before the ship entered a dock or basin. Mail was subject to no detention. A stricken ship within 3 miles of the shore had to fly a yellow and black flag at the main mast from sunrise to sunset.<ref name=Booker/>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, authority to quarantine people with infectious diseases is split between the state and federal governments.

It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a [[infection|communicable disease]], but do not have a confirmed [[medical diagnosis]]. It is distinct from [[Isolation (health care)|medical isolation]], in which those confirmed to be infected with a communicable disease are isolated from the healthy population. Quarantine considerations are often one aspect of [[border control]]. \n\nThe concept of quarantine has been known since biblical times, and is known to have been practised through history in various places. Notable quarantines in modern history include that of the village of [[Eyam]] in 1665 during the [[bubonic plague]] outbreak in England; [[American Samoa|East Samoa]] during the [[Spanish flu|1918 flu pandemic]]; the [[1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak]], and extensive quarantines applied throughout the world during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nEthical and practical considerations need to be considered when applying quarantine to people. Practice differs from country to country. In some countries, quarantine is just one of many measures governed by legislation relating to the broader concept of [[biosecurity]]; for example [[biosecurity in Australia|Australian biosecurity]] is governed by the single overarching ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]''.\n\n==Etymology and terminology ==\nThe word ''quarantine'' comes from ''quarantena'', meaning \"forty days\", used in the 14th-15th-century [[Venetian language]] and designating the period that all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the [[Black Death]] plague [[epidemic]]; it followed the ''trentino'', or thirty-day isolation period, first imposed in 1377 in the [[Republic of Ragusa]], [[Dalmatia]] (modern [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia).<ref name=\"JSM17\"/><ref name=\"Eccles\">{{cite book|editor1=Ronald Eccles|editor2=Olaf Weber|title=Common cold|year=2009|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|location=Basel|isbn=978-3-7643-9894-1|pages=210|edition=Online-Ausg.}}</ref><ref name=\"Mayer\">{{cite web |first= Johanna |last= Mayer |title= The Origin Of The Word 'Quarantine' |date=4 September 2018 |url= https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/the-origin-of-the-word-quarantine/ |access-date=17 March 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"EID2013\">{{cite journal|doi=10.3201/eid1902.ET1902|title=Etymologia: Quarantine|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=263|doi-access=free}}</ref> \n\n[[Merriam-Webster]] gives various meanings to the noun form, including \"a period of 40 days\", several relating to ships, \"a state of enforced isolation\", and as \"a restriction on the [[Freedom of movement|movement of people]] and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of [[disease]] or [[Pest (organism)|pests]]\".

All but that of 1897 were concerned with [[cholera]]. No result came of those at Paris (1852), Constantinople (1866), Vienna (1874), and Rome (1885), but each of the subsequent ones doctrine of constructive infection of a ship as coming from a scheduled port, and an approximation to the principles advocated by Great Britain for many years. The principal countries which retained the old system at the time were Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece and Russia (the British possessions at the time, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus, being under the same influence). The aim of each international sanitary convention had been to bind the governments to a uniform minimum of preventive action, with further restrictions permissible to individual countries. The minimum specified by international conventions was very nearly the same as the British practice, which had been in turn adapted to continental opinion in the matter of the importation of rags.\n\nThe Venice convention of 30 January 1892 dealt with cholera by the [[Suez Canal]] route; that of Dresden of 15 April 1893, with cholera within European countries; that of Paris of 3 April 1894, with cholera by the pilgrim traffic; and that of Venice, on 19 March 1897, was in connection with the outbreak of plague in the East, and the conference met to settle on an international basis the steps to be taken to prevent, if possible, its spread into Europe. An additional convention was signed in Paris on 3 December 1903.<ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 Text of the 1903 convention] British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, ''www.fco.gov.uk'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926134555/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 |date=26 September 2012}}, accessed 5 February 2020</ref>\n\nA multilateral international sanitary convention was concluded at Paris on 17 January 1912.<ref>Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 4, pp. 282\u2013413.</ref> This convention was most comprehensive and was designated to replace all previous conventions on that matter.

It was admitted that the incubation period was, as a rule, a comparatively short one, namely, of some three or four days. After much discussion ten days was accepted by a very large majority. The principle of [[disease notification]] was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify to other governments on the existence of plague within their several jurisdictions, and at the same time state the measures of prevention which are being carried out to prevent its diffusion. The area deemed to be infected was limited to the actual district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected merely because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no diffusion of the malady. As regards the precautions to be taken on land frontiers, it was decided that during the prevalence of plague every country had the inherent right to close its land frontiers against traffic. As regards the [[Red Sea]], it was decided after discussion that a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal, and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the period of incubation of the disease the prevention of which is in question. It was also agreed that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal in quarantine at Port Said by night as well as by day, and that passengers might embark in quarantine at that port. Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and are provided with a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal, in quarantine, subject only to the landing of those who were suffering from plague.\n\n====21st century====\nIn the 21st century, people suspected of carrying infectious diseases have been quarantined, as in the cases of [[Andrew Speaker]] (multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, 2007) and [[Kaci Hickox]] (Ebola, 2014). Moving infected patients to [[isolation ward]]s and home-based self-quarantine of people potentially exposed was the main way the [[Western African Ebola virus epidemic]] was ended in 2016; members of the 8th [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Emergency Committee criticised international travel restrictions imposed during the epidemic as ineffective due to difficulty of enforcement, and counterproductive as they slowed down aid efforts.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2015/ihr-ebola-8th-meeting/en/|title=Statement on the 8th meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee regarding the Ebola outbreak in West Africa|author=|date=|publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> The [[People's Republic of China]] has employed mass quarantines - firstly of the city of [[Wuhan]] and subsequently of all of [[Hubei]] province (population 55.5 million) - in the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].

It is sometimes called the \"yellow jack\" but this was also a name for [[yellow fever]], which probably derives its common name from the flag, not the colour of the victims (cholera ships also used a yellow flag).<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Sehdev PS|title=The origin of quarantine|journal=[[Clinical Infectious Diseases]]|date=1 November 2002|volume=35|issue=9|pages=1071\u20132|doi=10.1086/344062|pmid=12398064|doi-access=free}}</ref> The plain [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] (\"Quebec\" or '''Q''' in [[international maritime signal flags]]) probably derives its letter symbol for its initial use in ''quarantine'', but this flag in modern times indicates the opposite\u2014a ship that 'requests free [[pratique]]', i.e. that declares itself free of quarantinable disease, and requests boarding and routine port inspection.<ref>[http://flagspot.net/flags/xf~q.html Quarantine Flag history] ''flagspot.net'', accessed 2 February 2020</ref>\n\n==Ethical and practical considerations==\nThe quarantining of people often raises questions of [[civil rights]], especially in cases of long confinement or segregation from society, such as that of [[Mary Mallon]] (also known as Typhoid Mary), a [[typhoid fever]] [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]] who was arrested and quarantined in 1907 and later spent the last 23 years and 7 months of her life in medical isolation at Riverside Hospital on [[North and South Brother Islands, New York City#North Brother Island|North Brother Island]].<ref>[http://broadstreetonline.org/2015/02/typhoid-mary-and-the-publics-right-to-health/ \"Typhoid Mary and the Public's Right to Health,\"] ''Broad Street Magazine,'' 16 February 2015, 12:37 pm</ref><ref>[http://time.com/3474945/politics-quarantines-typhoid-mary-ebola/ Mary Beth Keane, \"The History of Quarantine Is the History of Discrimination,\"] 6 October 2014 ''Time Magazine,'', accessed 5 February 2020</ref>\n\n===The United Nations and the Siracusa Principles===\nGuidance on when and how human rights can be restricted to prevent the spread of infectious disease is found in The Siracusa Principles, a non-binding document developed by the [[Siracusa International Institute for Criminal Justice and Human Rights]] and adopted by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] in 1984.<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4672bc122.html United Nations Economic and Social Council UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, \"The Siracusa Principles on the limitation and derogation provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\" Section I.A.12 UN Doc.

Limitations on rights (such as quarantine) must be 'strictly necessary,' meaning that they must: \n* respond to a pressing public or social need (health)\n* [[Proportionality (law)|proportionately]] pursue a legitimate aim (prevent the spread of infectious disease)\n* be the [[least restrictive means]] required for achieving the purpose of the limitation\n* be provided for and carried out in accordance with the law\n* be neither arbitrary nor discriminatory\n* only limit rights that are within the jurisdiction of the state seeking to impose the limitation.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 4463097|year = 2013|last1 = Todrys|first1 = K.

These include [[post-traumatic stress]], confusion and anger.  According to a \"Rapid Review\" published in [[The Lancet]] in response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], \"Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.\"<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8|title=The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: Rapid review of the evidence|year=2020|last1=Brooks|first1=Samantha K.|last2=Webster|first2=Rebecca K.|last3=Smith|first3=Louise E.|last4=Woodland|first4=Lisa|last5=Wessely|first5=Simon|last6=Greenberg|first6=Neil|last7=Rubin|first7=Gideon James|journal=The Lancet|volume=395|issue=10227|pages=912\u2013920|pmid=32112714|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Short-term quarantines, e.g. for decontamination===\nQuarantine periods can be very short, such as in the case of a suspected [[anthrax]] attack, in which people are allowed to leave as soon as they shed their potentially contaminated garments and undergo a [[decontamination]] shower. For example, an article entitled \"Daily News workers quarantined\" describes a brief quarantine that lasted until people could be showered in a decontamination tent.<ref>[https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Anthrax-scare-temporarily-closes-Midland-Daily-7020034.php Kelly Nankervis: Anthrax scare temporarily closes Midland Daily News] ''Daily News/ www.ourmidland.com''</ref>\n\nThe February/March 2003 issue of ''HazMat Magazine'' suggests that people be \"locked in a room until proper decon could be performed\", in the event of \"suspect anthrax\".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n''[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|Standard-Times]]'' senior correspondent Steve Urbon (14 February 2003) describes such temporary quarantine powers:\n<blockquote>\nCivil rights activists in some cases have objected to people being rounded up, stripped and showered against their will. But Capt. Chmiel said local health authorities have \"certain powers to quarantine people\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tognotti|first1=E.|title=Lessons from the history of quarantine, from plague to influenza A.|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=19|issue=2|pages=254\u2013259|doi=10.3201/eid1902.120312|pmid=23343512|pmc=3559034|year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Qureshi|first1=Adnan|title=Ebola Virus Disease: From Origin to Outbreak|date=2016|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=978-0128042304|page=62}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe purpose of such quarantine-for-decontamination is to prevent the spread of contamination and to contain the contamination such that others are not put at risk from a person fleeing a scene where contamination is suspect. It can also be used to limit exposure, as well as eliminate a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]].\n\nNew developments for quarantine include new concepts in quarantine vehicles such as the [[ambulance bus]], mobile hospitals, and lockdown/invacuation (inverse evacuation) procedures, as well as docking stations for an ambulance bus to dock to a facility under lockdown.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Standard quarantine practices in different countries==\n{{Globalize|section|the English-speaking world|date=February 2020}}\n===Australia===\n{{further|Biosecurity in Australia}}\nBiosecurity in Australia is governed by the ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]''. The [[Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service]] (AQIS) is responsible for border inspection of products brought into Australia, and assesses the risks the products might harm Australian environment. No person, goods and vessels are permitted into Australia without clearance from AQIS. Visitors are required to fill in the information card on arriving in Australia. Besides other risk factors, visitors are required to declare what food and products made of wood and other natural materials they have. Visitors who fail to do so may be subject to a fine of A$220, or may face criminal prosecution and be fined up to A$100,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nAustralia has very strict quarantine standards. Quarantine in northern Australia is especially important because of its proximity to South-East Asia and the Pacific, which have many pests and diseases not present in Australia. For this reason, the region from Cairns to Broome\u2014including the [[Torres Strait]]\u2014is the focus for quarantine activities that protect all Australians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/about/public-awareness |title=Public Awareness and Education |accessdate=27 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405091101/http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/about/public-awareness |archivedate=5 April 2013  }}</ref> As Australia has been geographically isolated from other major continents for millions of years, there is an endemically unique ecosystem free of several severe pests and diseases that are present in many parts of the world.<ref name=\"daff\">{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/biosecurity/quarantine|title=Quarantine in Australia - Department of Agriculture|publisher=daff.gov.au|accessdate=14 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713013953/http://daff.gov.au/biosecurity/quarantine|archive-date=13 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> If other products are brought inside along with pests and diseases, it would damage the ecosystem seriously and add millions of costs in the local agricultural businesses.<ref name=\"australia\">{{cite web|title=Australian Quarantine a shared responsibility: The Government response|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity/australia/reports-pubs/nairn/govt-response|website=Australian Government|publisher=Department of Primary Industries and Energy|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThere are three quarantine [[Acts of Parliament]] in Canada: ''Quarantine Act'' (humans) and ''Health of Animals Act'' (animals) and ''Plant Protection Act'' (vegetations). The first legislation is enforced by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] after a complete rewrite in 2005. The second and third legislations are enforced by the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]. If a health emergency exists, the Governor in Council can prohibit importation of anything that it deems necessary under the ''Quarantine Act''.\n\nUnder the ''Quarantine Act'', all travellers must submit to screening and if they believe they might have come into contact with [[communicable disease]]s or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], they must disclose their whereabouts to a [[Border Services Officer]]. If the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller is or might have been infected with a communicable disease or refused to provide answers, a quarantine officer (QO) must be called and the person is to be isolated. If a person refuses to be isolated, any [[peace officer]] may arrest without warrant.\n\nA QO who has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller has or might have a communicable disease or is infested with vectors, after the medical examination of a traveller, can order him/her into treatment or measures to prevent the person from spreading the disease. QO can detain any traveller who refuses to comply with his/her orders or undergo health assessments as required by law.\n\nUnder the ''Health of Animals Act'' and ''Plant Protection Act'', inspectors can prohibit access to an infected area, dispose or treat any infected or suspected to be infected animals or plants. The Minister can order for compensation to be given if animals/plants were destroyed pursuant to these acts.\n\nEach province also enacts its own quarantine/environmental health legislation.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nUnder the ''Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance'' (HK Laws. Chap 599), a health officer may seize articles they believe to be infectious or containing infectious agents. All travellers, if requested, must submit themselves to a health officer. Failure to do so is against the law and is subject to arrest and prosecution.\n\nThe law allows for a health officer who have reasonable grounds to detain, isolate, quarantine anyone or anything believed to be infected and to restrict any articles from leaving a designated quarantine area. He/she may also order the Civil Aviation Department to prohibit the landing or leaving, embarking or disembarking of an aircraft. This power also extends to land, sea or air crossings.\n\nUnder the same ordinance, any police officer, health officer, member of the [[Civil Aid Service]], or member of the [[Auxiliary Medical Service]] can arrest a person who obstructs or escapes from detention.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nTo reduce the risk of introducing [[rabies]] from continental Europe, the United Kingdom used to require that dogs, and most other animals introduced to the country, spend six months in quarantine at an [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|HM Customs and Excise]] pound; this policy was abolished in 2000 in favour of a scheme generally known as [[Pet Passports]], where animals can avoid quarantine if they have documentation showing they are up to date on their appropriate [[vaccine|vaccinations]].<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad#countries-and-territories Bringing your pet dog, cat or ferret to the UK] ''www.gov.uk'', accessed 27 January 2020</ref>\n\n====British maritime quarantine rules 1711\u20131896====\nThe plague had disappeared from England for more than thirty years before the practice of quarantine against it was definitely established by the Quarantine Act 1710 (''[[9 Ann.]]'') The first act was called for due to fears that the plague might be imported from Poland and the [[Baltic states]]. The second act of 1721 was due to the prevalence of plague at [[Marseille]] and other places in [[Provence, France]]. It was renewed in 1733 after a new outbreak in [[continental Europe]], and again in 1743, due to an epidemic in [[Messina]]. In 1752 a rigorous quarantine clause was introduced into an act regulating trade with [[the Levant]], and various arbitrary orders were issued during the next twenty years to meet the supposed danger of infection from the Baltic states. Although no plague cases ever came to England during that period, the restrictions on traffic became more stringent, and in 1788 a very strict Quarantine Act was passed, with provisions affecting cargoes in particular. The act was revised in 1801 and 1805, and in 1823\u201324 an elaborate inquiry was followed by an act making quarantine only at discretion of the [[privy council]], which recognised yellow fever or other highly infectious diseases as calling for quarantine, along with plague. The threat of cholera in 1831 was the last occasion in England of the use of quarantine restrictions. Cholera affected every country in Europe despite all efforts to keep it out. When cholera returned to England in 1849, 1853 and 1865\u201366, no attempt was made to seal the ports. In 1847 the privy council ordered all arrivals with a clean [[bill of health]] from the [[Black Sea]] and the Levant to be admitted, provided there had been no case of plague during the voyage, and afterwards the practice of quarantine was discontinued.<ref name=Booker>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7OoDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT5&lpg=PT5&dq= John Booker, ''Maritime Quarantine: The British Experience, c.1650\u20131900,'' in ''The History of Medicine in Context,'' Routledge, 2016.]{{ISBN|1351919849}} ''books.google.com'', accessed 6 February 2020</ref>\n\nAfter the passing of the first Quarantine Act (1710) the protective practices in England were haphazard and arbitrary. In 1721 two vessels carrying cotton goods from Cyprus, then affected by the plague, were ordered to be burned with their cargoes, the owners receiving an [[indemnity]]. By the clause in the Levant Trade Act of 1752, ships arriving in the United Kingdom with a \"foul bill\" (i.e. coming from a country where plague existed) had to return to the [[lazaret]]s of Malta, Venice, Messina, Livorno, Genoa or Marseille, to complete a quarantine or to have their cargoes opened and aired. Since 1741 [[Stangate]] Creek (on the [[Medway]]) had been the quarantine station but it was available only for vessels with clean bills of health. In 1755 lazarets in the form of [[Hulk (ship type)|floating hulks]] were established in England for the first time, the cleansing of cargo (particularly by exposure to [[dew]]s) having been done previously on the ship's deck. No medical inspections were conducted, but control was the responsibility of the Officers of [[Customs|Royal Customs]] and quarantine. In 1780, when plague was in Poland, even vessels with grain from the Baltic had to spend forty days in quarantine, and unpack and air their cargoes, but due to complaints mainly from Edinburgh and Leith, an exception was made for grain after that date. About 1788 an order of the council required every ship liable to quarantine to hoist a [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] in the daytime and show a light at the main topmast head at night, in case of meeting any vessel at sea, or upon arriving within four [[league (unit)|leagues]] of the coast of Great Britain or Ireland.<ref name=Booker/>\n\nAfter 1800, ships from plague-affected countries (or with foul bills) were permitted to complete their quarantine in the Medway instead of at a Mediterranean port on the way, and an extensive lazaret was built on Chetney Hill near [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] (although it was later demolished). The use of floating hulks as lazarets continued as before. In 1800 two ships with [[hide (skin)|hides]] from [[Mogador]] in Morocco were ordered to be sunk with their cargoes at the [[Nore]], the owners receiving an indemnity. Animal hides were suspected of harbouring infections, along with a long list of other items, and these had to be exposed on the ship's deck for twenty-one days or less (six days for each instalment of the cargo), and then transported to the lazaret, where they were opened and aired for another forty days. The whole detention of the vessel was from sixty to sixty-five days, including the time for reshipment of her cargo. Pilots had to pass fifteen days on board a convalescent ship. From 1846 onwards the quarantine establishments in the United Kingdom were gradually reduced, while the last vestige of the British quarantine law was removed by the [[Public Health Act]] of 1896, which repealed the Quarantine Act of 1825 (with dependent clauses of other acts), and transferred from the privy council to the [[Local Government Board]] the powers to deal with ships arriving infected with yellow fever or plague. The powers to deal with cholera ships had been already transferred by the [[Public Health Act 1875]].<ref name=Booker/>\n\nBritish regulations of 9 November 1896 applied to [[yellow fever]], [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and [[cholera]]. Officers of the Customs, as well as of [[Coast Guard|Royal Coast Guard]] and the [[Board of Trade]] (for signalling), were empowered to take the initial steps. They certified in writing the master of a supposedly infected ship, and detained the vessel provisionally for not more than twelve hours, giving notice meanwhile to the [[Port authority|port sanitary authority]]. The medical officer of the port boarded the ship and examined every person in it. Every person found infected was taken to a hospital and quarantined under the orders of the medical officer, and the vessel remained under his orders. Every person suspected could be detained on board for 48 hours or removed to the hospital for a similar period. All others were free to land upon giving the addresses of their destinations to be sent to the respective local authorities, so that the dispersed passengers and crew could be kept individually under observation for a few days. The ship was then disinfected, dead bodies buried at sea, infected clothing, bedding, etc., destroyed or disinfected, and [[bilge-water]] and [[Sailing ballast|water-ballast]] pumped out at a suitable distance before the ship entered a dock or basin. Mail was subject to no detention. A stricken ship within 3 miles of the shore had to fly a yellow and black flag at the main mast from sunrise to sunset.<ref name=Booker/>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, authority to quarantine people with infectious diseases is split between the state and federal governments.

One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

Householders were required to pay a charge of two [[shilling]]s per annum for each hearth, with half the payment due at [[Michaelmas]] and half at [[Lady Day]]. Exemptions to the tax were granted, to those in receipt of [[Poor Relief Act 1662|poor relief]], those whose houses were worth less than 20 shillings a year and those who paid neither church nor poor [[rates (tax)#United Kingdom|rates]]. Also exempt were charitable institutions such as schools and [[almshouses]], and industrial hearths with the exception of smiths' forges and bakers' ovens.

The numbers of hearths are generally proportional to the size of the house. The assessments can be used to indicate the numbers and local distribution of larger and smaller houses. Not every room had a hearth, and not all houses of the same size had exactly the same number of hearths, so they are not an exact measure of house size.

Commenting on the social impact of such mobs, one character (articulating the police view) says, \"We call them flash crowds, and we watch for them.\" In related short stories, they are named as a prime location for illegal activities (such as pickpocketing and looting) to take place.\n\nFlash mobs began as a form of [[performance art]].<ref name=\"time\" /> While they started as an apolitical act, flash mobs may share superficial similarities to political [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]].

Commenting on the social impact of such mobs, one character (articulating the police view) says, \"We call them flash crowds, and we watch for them.\" In related short stories, they are named as a prime location for illegal activities (such as pickpocketing and looting) to take place.\n\nFlash mobs began as a form of [[performance art]].<ref name=\"time\" /> While they started as an apolitical act, flash mobs may share superficial similarities to political [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]].
