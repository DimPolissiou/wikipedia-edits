With the advent of modern footwear, running [[barefoot]] has become less common in most parts of the world but is still practiced in parts of Africa and Latin America. In some Western countries, barefoot running has grown in popularity due to perceived health benefits.<ref>Reader, Andrew. \"2 Rules For Beginning Barefoot Running (And Avoiding Injury).\" Breaking Muscle. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 Nov. 2014. <http://breakingmuscle.com/running/2-rules-for-beginning-barefoot-running-and-avoiding-injury>.</ref>\n\nScientific research into the practice of running barefoot has not reached a clear consensus regarding its risks or its benefits. While footwear might provide protection from cuts, bruises, impact and weather, proponents argue that running barefoot reduces the risk of chronic injuries (notably [[repetitive stress injuries]]) caused by [[heel strike (gait)|heel striking]] in padded running shoes.\n\nThe barefoot movement has prompted some manufacturers to introduce thin-soled and flexible shoes such as traditional [[moccasin]]s and [[Huarache (running shoe)|huarache]]s for '''minimalist running'''.\n\n== History ==\nThroughout most of human history, running was performed while barefoot or in thin-soled shoes such as [[moccasin]]s. This practice continues today in [[Kenya]] and among the [[Tarahumara]] people of northern Mexico.<ref name=\"McDougall_Boston_Globe\">{{cite news|last=McDougall|first=Christopher|title=What Ruins Running|url=https://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/magazine/articles/2009/04/19/what_ruins_running/|accessdate=14 November 2010|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=19 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101014045313/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/magazine/articles/2009/04/19/what_ruins_running/| archivedate= 14 October 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Historians believe that the runners of [[Ancient Greece]] ran barefoot.

Scientists studying runners' foot motions have observed striking differences between habitually shod runners (wearing shoes) and barefoot runners. The foot of habitually shod runners typically lands with an initial heel strike, while the foot of a barefoot runner lands with a more springy step on the middle, or on the ball of the foot.<ref name=\"Reuters_0127\">{{cite news|title=The best running shoe may be nature's own: study|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/27/us-running-idUSTRE60Q6FA20100127|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=27 January 2010}}</ref> In addition, the strike is shorter in duration and the step rate is higher.

Forefoot strike, shorter step duration, higher rate and higher muscle pre-activation are techniques to reduce stress of repetitive high shocks.<ref name=\"Divert\"/> This avoids a very painful and heavy impact, equivalent to two to three times the body weight.<ref name=\"LiebermanDE\"/> \"People who don't wear shoes when they run have an astonishingly different strike\", said Daniel E. Lieberman, professor of human evolutionary biology at [[Harvard University]] and co-author of a paper appearing in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. \"By landing on the middle or front of the foot, barefoot runners have almost no impact collision, much less than most shod runners generate when they heel-strike.\"<ref name=\"Hersher_Rebecca\">{{cite news|last=Hersher|first=Rebecca|title=Study finds barefoot runners have less foot stress than shod ones (w/ Video)|url=http://phys.org/news183817654.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=[[PhysOrg]]|date=27 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nHowever, when comparing different populations of habitually barefoot runners, not all of them favor the forefoot strike.

Better running economy observed when running barefoot compared to running with shoes can be explained by a better use of the muscle elasticity. In fact, reduction of contact time and higher pre-stretch level can enhance the stretch shortening cycle behavior of the plantar flexor muscles and thus possibly allow a better storage and restitution of elastic energy compared to shod running.<ref name=\"Divert\" /><ref name=Hanson_et_al>{{cite journal|last1=Hanson|first1=N.J.|last2=Berg|first2=K.|last3=Deka|first3=P.|last4=Meendering|first4=J.R.|last5=Ryan|first5=C.|title=Oxygen cost of running barefoot vs. running shod|journal=International Journal of Sports Medicine.|date=2011|volume=32|issue=6|pages=401\u20136|url=http://www.therunningclinic.ca/medias/mailinglist/2010-hanson-o2-barefoot-vs-sho.pdf|doi=10.1055/s-0030-1265203|pmid=21472628}}</ref>\n\nRunning in shoes also appears to increase the risk of [[ankle]] sprains, [[plantar fasciitis]], as well as other chronic injuries of the lower limb.

Scientists studying runners' foot motions have observed striking differences between habitually shod runners (wearing shoes) and barefoot runners. The foot of habitually shod runners typically lands with an initial heel strike, while the foot of a barefoot runner lands with a more springy step on the middle, or on the ball of the foot.<ref name=\"Reuters_0127\">{{cite news|title=The best running shoe may be nature's own: study|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/27/us-running-idUSTRE60Q6FA20100127|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=27 January 2010}}</ref> In addition, the strike is shorter in duration and the step rate is higher. When looking at the muscle activity (electromyography), studies have shown a higher pre-activation of the plantar flexor muscles when running barefoot.<ref name=\"Divert\">Divert C., Mornieux G., Freychat P., Baur H., Mayer F., Belli A., \"Mechanical comparison of Barefoot and Shod Running.\" International Journal of Sports Medicine 26.7. 2005; 593\u2013598</ref> Indeed, since muscles' role is to prepare the locomotor system for the contact with the ground, muscle activity before the strike depends on the expected impact. Forefoot strike, shorter step duration, higher rate and higher muscle pre-activation are techniques to reduce stress of repetitive high shocks.<ref name=\"Divert\"/> This avoids a very painful and heavy impact, equivalent to two to three times the body weight.<ref name=\"LiebermanDE\"/> \"People who don't wear shoes when they run have an astonishingly different strike\", said Daniel E. Lieberman, professor of human evolutionary biology at [[Harvard University]] and co-author of a paper appearing in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. \"By landing on the middle or front of the foot, barefoot runners have almost no impact collision, much less than most shod runners generate when they heel-strike.\"<ref name=\"Hersher_Rebecca\">{{cite news|last=Hersher|first=Rebecca|title=Study finds barefoot runners have less foot stress than shod ones (w/ Video)|url=http://phys.org/news183817654.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|newspaper=[[PhysOrg]]|date=27 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nHowever, when comparing different populations of habitually barefoot runners, not all of them favor the forefoot strike. A 2012 study by Hatala et al. focusing on 38 runners of the [[Daasanach people|Daasanach]] tribe in [[Kenya]] found that a majority of runners favored a heel strike instead of a forefoot strike.<ref name=\"Hatala_KG\">{{cite journal|author1=Hatala, K.G. |author2=Dingwall, H.L. |author3=Wunderlich, R.E. |author4=Richmond, B.G. |title=Variation in Foot Strike Patterns during Running among Habitually Barefoot Populations.|journal=[[PLOS One]]|date=9 January 2013|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0052548|pmid=23326341 |pmc=3541372 |bibcode = 2013PLoSO...852548H|volume=8|issue=1 |pages=e52548}}</ref> Presently, Hatala and Lieberman are comparing their data, but Lieberman did note that his study, which focused on the [[Kalenjin people]], also found some barefoot runners favoring a heel strike as well.

The longitudinal arch has been observed to decrease in length by an average of 4.7&nbsp;mm, suggesting activation of foot musculature when barefoot that is usually inactive when shod.

Better running economy observed when running barefoot compared to running with shoes can be explained by a better use of the muscle elasticity. In fact, reduction of contact time and higher pre-stretch level can enhance the stretch shortening cycle behavior of the plantar flexor muscles and thus possibly allow a better storage and restitution of elastic energy compared to shod running.<ref name=\"Divert\" /><ref name=Hanson_et_al>{{cite journal|last1=Hanson|first1=N.J.|last2=Berg|first2=K.|last3=Deka|first3=P.|last4=Meendering|first4=J.R.|last5=Ryan|first5=C.|title=Oxygen cost of running barefoot vs. running shod|journal=International Journal of Sports Medicine.|date=2011|volume=32|issue=6|pages=401\u20136|url=http://www.therunningclinic.ca/medias/mailinglist/2010-hanson-o2-barefoot-vs-sho.pdf|doi=10.1055/s-0030-1265203|pmid=21472628}}</ref>\n\nRunning in shoes also appears to increase the risk of [[ankle]] sprains, [[plantar fasciitis]], as well as other chronic injuries of the lower limb.
