Established in 1952 as a school for the children of international personnel working at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) in nearby [[Rocquencourt]], the Lyc\u00e9e International caters to students with international and multilingual backgrounds.<ref name=\"British Section\">\"History of the School,\" The British Section: The Lyc\u00e9e International Saint-Germain-en-Laye & Partner Schools, accessed October 26, 2013, [http://www.lycee-international.net/History.html].</ref> With a typical success rate of 99.9 to 100 percent on the French ''[[baccalaur\u00e9at]]'', the Lyc\u00e9e International consistently ranks among France's top public schools and is considered to be the country's best public international school.<ref name=\"L'Express\">\"Lyc\u00e9e International - SAINT-GERMAIN-EN-LAYE,\" ''L'Express'', accessed October 26, 2013, [http://www.lexpress.fr/palmares/lycees/0/lycee-international-st-germain-en-laye_0783549J.html].</ref><ref>\"Classement Lyc\u00e9e International Saint-Germain-en-Laye Acad\u00e9mie Versailles,\" ''Le Figaro \u00c9tudiant'', accessed October 26, 2013, [http://classement-lycees.etudiant.lefigaro.fr/academie-versailles/yvelines/st-germain-en-laye/lycee-international/].</ref><ref>\"Private & International Schools in France,\" Learn4Good, accessed November 7, 2013, [http://www.learn4good.com/great_schools/children_schools_france.htm].</ref>\n\nStudents at the Lyc\u00e9e International must be fluent in one of the languages taught in one of the school's fourteen national sections: American, British, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. However, they are not required to be fluent in [[French language|French]] to be admitted, as there is a special one-year ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial'' language program. The academic curriculum of the international sections supplements the standard French curriculum with additional courses in literature/language and history/geography, taught in the language of the students' respective national sections, allowing them to pursue the [[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Option Internationale du Baccalaur.C3.A9at|''option internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at'']] (OIB), the international variant of the French ''baccalaur\u00e9at''.\n \nThe school's main campus at 2 bis rue du Fer \u00e0 Cheval ({{coord|48|53|44|N|2|3|40|E}}) in Saint-Germain-en-Laye contains a preschool (''maternelle''), a primary school (''\u00e9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire''), a middle school (''coll\u00e8ge''), and a high school (''lyc\u00e9e''). Due to the size of the student body, some larger national sections have satellite campuses for primary and middle school grades at other local schools in the area of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. All students return to the main campus for their final three (''lyc\u00e9e''-level) years.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of the school to date can be described by three distinct phases:\n\n===1951\u20131965===\n\nIn 1951, the then-recently established [[NATO]] (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation), a grouping of 15 countries, created [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) with the aim of ensuring peace and security in the North Atlantic region, and promising European members the support of the United States in the event of any future aggression.\n\nSHAPE was installed at [[Rocquencourt]], and [[Saint Germain-en-Laye]] was chosen as the place of residence for the serving officers and their families. The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau d'Hennemont|fr}} to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]]. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 [[French language|French]] children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the [[Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales]] and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]], retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected M Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in [[Belgium]], and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, [[Edgar Scherer]]. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, [[Jean Pierre Maillard|Jean-Pierre Maillard]], had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to [[Patrick Charpeil]], who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\n[[Yves Lemaire]] took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts. France Bessis became proviseur of the school in 2019. \n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French staff teach subjects to French national standards and foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s thirteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):<ref>[http://www.lycee-international.com/structur/specificites.htm] Specificites du Lycee International</ref>\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Six hours in the middles school, including four hours of literature/language and two hours of history\n*Eight hours in the upper school, usually divided into four hours of literature/language and four hours of history/geography**\n\n(**American Section students have five hours of literature/language and three hours of history/geography, as do Polish Section students. Japanese Section students have six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography. Chinese section students take math courses during section time instead of history.\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nLyc\u00e9e International students must take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills. \n\n\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye have traditionally fluctuated between 99% and 100%.<ref name=\"L'Express\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! style=\"width:22%\" colspan=\"2\" | Total\n! style=\"width:22%\" colspan=\"2\" |Serie L\n! style=\"width:22%\" colspan=\"2\" |Serie ES\n! style=\"width:22%\" colspan=\"2\" |Serie S\n|-\n! # Students !!

Students are taught the relevant national curriculum alongside the standard French curriculum. Foreign teachers in each of the national sections give the students lessons in literature, geography and history (generally from six to eight hours a week according to the grade) in their native tongue. However, all other disciplines of the official program are taught in French.\n\n* American Section [http://www.americansection.org/] Est. 1952, approx. 700 students\n:The American Section Program starts in Pre-K and goes through 12th grade, enrolling approximately 690 students. About 60 percent of its students are U.S. citizens; of these many hold both French and American citizenship. Most of the remaining 40 percent are French citizens who have spent considerable time in the United States or have had American schooling. The American Section provides an international education within the context of the Lycee International. Students from preschool to college preparatory level experience a hybrid of American and French curricula with an emphasis on language, math, and science skills. The American Section provides an American educational and cultural experience, allowing students to maintain strong links with their American culture while developing a consciousness as global citizens.\n:The American Section pursues its mission through an American curriculum which culminates in the French Baccalaureate with International Option, as well as through a broad and enriching co-curricular program including such activities as drama, music, community service, sports and student publications.\n:The Ecole Schnapper and the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby, also located in St. Germain en Laye, are American Section partner schools. Approximately 65 students in grades K-5 (CP-CM2) attend the Ecole Schnapper, and 160 students in grades 6-9 (6\u00e8me-3\u00e8me) the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby.

However, they are not required to be fluent in [[French language|French]] to be admitted, as there is a special one-year ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial'' language program. The academic curriculum of the international sections supplements the standard French curriculum with additional courses in literature/language and history/geography, taught in the language of the students' respective national sections, allowing them to pursue the [[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Option Internationale du Baccalaur.C3.A9at|''option internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at'']] (OIB), the international variant of the French ''baccalaur\u00e9at''.\n \nThe school's main campus at 2 bis rue du Fer \u00e0 Cheval ({{coord|48|53|44|N|2|3|40|E}}) in Saint-Germain-en-Laye contains a preschool (''maternelle''), a primary school (''\u00e9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire''), a middle school (''coll\u00e8ge''), and a high school (''lyc\u00e9e''). Due to the size of the student body, some larger national sections have satellite campuses for primary and middle school grades at other local schools in the area of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. All students return to the main campus for their final three (''lyc\u00e9e''-level) years.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of the school to date can be described by three distinct phases:\n\n===1951\u20131965===\n\nIn 1951, the then-recently established [[NATO]] (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation), a grouping of 15 countries, created [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) with the aim of ensuring peace and security in the North Atlantic region, and promising European members the support of the United States in the event of any future aggression.\n\nSHAPE was installed at [[Rocquencourt]], and [[Saint Germain-en-Laye]] was chosen as the place of residence for the serving officers and their families. The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau d'Hennemont|fr}} to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]]. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 [[French language|French]] children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the [[Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales]] and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]], retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected M Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in [[Belgium]], and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, [[Edgar Scherer]]. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, [[Jean Pierre Maillard|Jean-Pierre Maillard]], had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to [[Patrick Charpeil]], who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\n[[Yves Lemaire]] took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nIn September 2012, Mr. Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur (headmaster).\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French staff teach subjects to French national standards and foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s thirteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):<ref>[http://www.lycee-international.com/structur/specificites.htm] Specificites du Lycee International</ref>\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Four hours of literature/language and two hours of history in the middle school\n*Four hours of literature/language and four hours of history in the high school**\n(**the 'American Section' is an exception to this rule, receiving five hours of literature/language and three hours of history; the 'Polish Section' is an exception to this rule as well, having five hours of literature/language, two hours of History and one hour of Geography; as for the 'Japanese Section', it has six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography))\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nMost students opt to take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills. Students who sit for the [[baccalaur\u00e9at]] choose one of three streams (termed ''s\u00e9ries'') in their last two ''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'' years. Each stream results in a specialization and carries different weights (''coefficients'') associated with each subject.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:33%\" | S <br /> ''scientifique''<br /> (sciences) \n! style=\"width:33%\" | ES<br />''sciences \u00e9conomiques et sociales''<br /> (economics and social sciences) \n! style=\"width:33%\" | L <br />''litt\u00e9raire''<br /> (literature)\n|- \n| The natural sciences stream requires a high level in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] & [[chemistry]], and [[biology]] or, if available, engineering sciences. \n| The ''bac ES'' is balanced between literary and economic and social courses of studies, and students must take an [[economics]] and [[social sciences]] exam. \n| The ''bac L'' weighs [[French literature]], [[philosophy]], [[history]] & [[geography]], and [[language|foreign languages]] heavily.\n|}\n\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye have traditionally fluctuated between 99% and 100%.<ref name=\"L'Express\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12%\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! style=\"width:22%\" colspan=\"2\" | Total\n! style=\"width:22%\" colspan=\"2\" |Serie L\n! style=\"width:22%\" colspan=\"2\" |Serie ES\n! style=\"width:22%\" colspan=\"2\" |Serie S\n|-\n! # Students !!

Students are taught the relevant national curriculum alongside the standard French curriculum. Foreign teachers in each of the national sections give the students lessons in literature, geography and history (generally from six to eight hours a week according to the grade) in their native tongue. However, all other disciplines of the official program are taught in French.\n\n* American Section [http://www.americansection.org/] Est. 1952, approx. 700 students\n:The American Section Program starts in Pre-[[Kindergarten]] and goes through 12th grade, enrolling approximately 690 students. About 60 percent of its students are U.S. citizens; of these many hold both French and American citizenship. Most of the remaining 40 percent are French citizens who have spent considerable time in the United States or have had American schooling. The American Section provides an international education within the context of the Lycee International. Students from preschool to college preparatory level experience a hybrid of American and French curricula with an emphasis on language, math, and science skills. The American Section provides an American educational and cultural experience, allowing students to maintain strong links with their American culture while developing a consciousness as global citizens.\n\n:The American Section pursues its mission through an American curriculum which culminates in the French Baccalaureate with International Option, as well as through a broad and enriching co-curricular program including such activities as drama, music, community service, sports and student publications.\n\n:The Ecole Schnapper and the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby, also located in St. Germain en Laye, are American Section partner schools. Approximately 65 students in grades K-5 (CP-CM2) attend the Ecole Schnapper, and 160 students in grades 6-9 (6\u00e8me-3\u00e8me) the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby.

{"title_page": "Traditionalist Catholicism", "text_new": "{{about|the modern movement|the 19th-century movement|Traditionalism in the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:Unchurch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Altar in [[Newman University Church]], [[Dublin]] arranged as before the Second Vatican Council]]\n\n'''Traditionalist Catholicism''' is a set of religious beliefs and practices comprising customs, traditions, [[liturgy|liturgical]] forms, public and private, individual and collective devotions, and presentations of [[Catholic Church]] teachings that were in vogue in the decades that immediately preceded the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u201365). It is associated in particular with attachment to the 1570{{ndash}}1970 form of the [[Roman Rite]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (the [[Tridentine Mass]]), which traditionalist Catholics call the Traditional Latin Mass or TLM or the Extraordinary Form of the Mass. \n\nTraditionalist Catholics were disturbed by the liturgical changes that followed the Second Vatican Council, which they feel stripped the liturgy of its outward sacredness and made it too Protestant, eroding faith in the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]]. Many also oppose the social teachings given by the Church during and after the Council, and see the teaching on [[ecumenism]] as blurring the distinction between Catholicism and other religions.\n\n==History==\nThe modern traditionalist movement traces its roots to at least the early 1970s, when conservative Catholics opposed to or uncomfortable with the social and liturgical changes brought about by the Second Vatican Council began to coalesce. In 1970, French Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] founded the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] (SSPX), made up of priests who would say only the Traditional Latin Mass and who stood opposed to what he saw as excessive liberal influences in the Church. Over time, Lefebvre's movement grew despite split-offs by various offshoot groups. Some Catholics, many never affiliated with Lefebvre, took the position of [[sedevacantism]], which teaches John XXIII and his successors are heretics and cannot therefore be considered popes, and that the new Church and new expressions of the sacraments are not valid. Other, marginal groups known as [[conclavism|conclavists]] have elected their own popes in opposition to the men generally considered by the world to be the true popes. The [[Society of Saint Pius V]] (SSPV) broke off from Lefebvre over its objections to the SSPX's use of the missal of [[Pope John XXIII]], preferring instead the missal in use prior to the post-1955 [[liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII]], and publicly questioning the legitimacy of the post-Vatican II popes. Lefebvre officially renounced these positions, but his movement still drew the suspicion of Roman authorities. In 1988, he and another bishop [[\u00c9c\u00f4ne consecrations|consecrated]] four men as bishops without papal permission, resulting in an ''[[Latae sententiae]]'' [[excommunication]] for all six men directly involved, not of the Society. Some members of the SSPX, unwilling to participate in what they considered [[schism]], left and founded the [[Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter]] (FSSP), which celebrates the Traditional Latin Mass but in full communion with the Holy See. During the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI, numerous attempts were made to bring the SSPX back from its separation from the authority of the Church, including the lifting of the excommunications on the four surviving bishops by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2009.<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/letters/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20090310_remissione-scomunica.html Letter of Pope Benedict XVI, 10 March 2009]</ref> These efforts failed, but the efforts of the SSPX to negotiate with Rome led to the establishment of the minority [[SSPX Resistance]].\n\n==Different types of traditionalists==\n[[File:Palm-sunday-latin-mass.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Tridentine Mass]] in a [[chapel]] of the [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Boston|Cathedral of the Holy Cross]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Palm Sunday 2009]]\nTraditionalist Catholics may be divided into four broad groups.\n\n===Traditionalists in good standing with the Holy See===\nSince the Second Vatican Council, several traditionalist organizations have been started with or have subsequently obtained approval from the Catholic Church. These organizations accept in principle the documents of the Second Vatican Council, and regard the changes associated with the Council (such as the revision of the Mass) as legitimate, if often prudentially unwise, but celebrate the older forms with the approval of the Holy See.<ref>See, for instance, the decrees of erection of the [http://www.fssp.org/en/decerec.htm Priestly Fraternity of St Peter] and of the [http://la.revue.item.free.fr/commission_pontifical.htm Institute of the Good Shepherd]</ref>\n* [[Priestly Fraternity of St Peter]] (FSSP)\n* [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]] (ICKSP)\n* [[Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer]] (FSSR)\n* [[Institute of the Good Shepherd]] (IBP)\n* Servants of Jesus and Mary ([[Servi Jesu et Mariae]], SJM)\n* [[Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem]] (CRNJ)\n* [[Canons Regular of Saint John Cantius]] (SJC)\n* [http://www.cruzios.org/ Canons Regular of the Holy Cross]\n* [[Fraternity of Saint Vincent Ferrer]]\n* [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney]] (PAASJV)\n* Miles Christi (MC)\n\nThere are also multiple monastic communities, including\n* [[Monastery of Our Lady of the Annunciation of Clear Creek]]\n* [[Monastery of St. Benedict (Norcia)|Monastery of St. Benedict in Norcia]]\n* [[Monks of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel]]\n* [[Monastery of Our Lady of the Cenacle]]\n* [[Le Barroux Abbey]]\n\nSee [[Communities using the Tridentine Mass]] for a more detailed list.\n\nIn addition, many traditionalist Catholics in good standing with Rome are served by local diocesan or religious priests who are willing and able to offer the traditional rites. Many other Catholics who sympathize with or who identify themselves as traditionalist are not able to attend the traditional liturgy regularly because it is not offered in their area (at least not with regular canonical standing) and attend the [[Mass of Paul VI]], the current ordinary or normal<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html Letter of Pope Benedict XVI accompanying his motu proprio] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''</ref> Roman Rite of Mass following the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Others may attend the liturgies of [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], if they are available. There are also numerous local and international lay organizations of traditionalist Catholics, such as the youth-groups of [[Juventutem]].\n\nTraditionalist Catholics are considered by some to differ from neo-conservatives in that the neo-conservative bases his entire belief system on the teaching of the present magisterium, while the traditionalist interprets the present with the perspective of the past.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianorder.com/features/features_2001/features_mar01.html |title=Operative Points of View |last=Ripperger |first=Chad |publisher=Christianorder.com |date=March 2001 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}</ref>\n\n===Traditionalists viewed by the Holy See as of irregular status===\nSome traditionalists receive the Sacraments from priests considered suspended ''a divinis'' by Church authorities, though these priests and the Catholics that flock to them affirm their loyalty to the Church, while at the same time affirming that teachings of the Second Vatican Council on ecumenism, religious liberty, and collegiality are inconsistent with Catholic teaching and doctrine. They form what Julie Byrne terms the right wing of [[independent Catholicism]]: \"Independents vary widely, ranging from right to left in the political spectrum. On the right traditionalist churches practice versions of Catholicism more conservative than Rome. These include the [[Society of St. Pius X]], founded by [[Marcel Lefebvre]], as well as the [[Mount St. Michael]]'s community in [[Spokane, Washington]], and actor [[Mel Gibson]]'s church in [[Malibu, California]], which made headlines when he directed the movie, ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', in 2004. \n\nThe largest priestly society to fit this description is the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] (SSPX), which was founded in 1970, with the authorisation of the bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg|Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg]], by Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]]. Members of this category view many of the post-Conciliar changes as doctrinally and pastorally unacceptable. They recognise the official Church hierarchy, while generally functioning independently of them and rejecting some decisions which they perceive as inconsistent with the Catholic faith, or ineffective in terms of catechesis and how the Catholic faith is passed down. This way of acting draws accusations of disloyalty and disobedience from many, including from members of the preceding groups that are recognised by the Holy See; on the other hand, the SSPX and groups like them consider their accusers guilty of blind obedience, which is not imposed by\u2014and can be contrary to\u2014the requirements of Catholic faith and morals. Discussions between the SSPX and the Holy See have been in progress for some years. In January 2009 the Prefect of the [[Congregation for Bishops]] remitted the excommunications which the Congregation had declared to have been incurred by the Society's bishops in 1988. Bishop [[Bernard Fellay]] of the Society expressed his gratitude for this act, though the Society has always held that the excommunications never took effect in the first place (citing canon 1323, \u00a74, canon 1323, 7 and canon 1324, \u00a73; \u00a71, 8 of the 1983 [[Code of Canon Law]]). The Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops further expressed the hope that the Society would speedily return to \"full communion\" with the Church by showing \"true fidelity and true acknowledgment of the Magisterium and the authority of the pope\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0900355.htm |title=Pope lifts excommunications of Lefebvrite bishops |publisher=Catholicnews.com |date=January 27, 2009|accessdate=2011-06-30}}</ref> The SSPX rejects the notion of \"full\" and \"partial\" communion with the Church, insisting that they belong to the Church according to the criteria given by Pope Pius XII, because they have the same faith, celebrate the same Sacraments, and recognise the same hierarchy of the Church. More recently, the Vatican has granted priests of the SSPX the authority to hear confessions and has authorised local ordinaries, in certain circumstances, to grant delegation to SSPX priests to act as the qualified witness required for valid celebration of marriage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/04/04/new_pastoral_provisions_for_sacrament_of_marriage_for_sspx/1303274|title=New pastoral provisions for Sacrament of Marriage for SSPX|access-date=2017-11-02}}</ref> In each of these documents the hope was expressed that thereby \"the process towards full institutional regularisation may be facilitated\".\n\n===Sedevacantists===\n{{Main|Sedevacantism}}\nSedevacantists hold that the post-Vatican II popes have forfeited their position through their acceptance of [[heresy|heretical teachings]] connected with the Second Vatican Council and consequently there is at present no known true pope.<ref name=HDC>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8C3TKNdn5oC&pg=PA399 |title=Historical Dictionary of Catholicism|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> They conclude, on the basis of their rejection of the revised Mass rite and their rejection of certain aspects of postconciliar Church teaching as false, that the popes involved are also false.<ref name=IUP>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUqp1_31B-MC&pg=PA257 |title=Being Right|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> This is a minority position among traditionalist Catholics<ref name=HDC/><ref name=UCP>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qd5yzP5hdiEC&pg=PA88 |title=Fundamentalisms Observed|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> and a highly divisive one,<ref name=IUP/><ref name=UCP/> so that many who hold it prefer to say nothing of their view,<ref name=IUP/> while other sedevacantists have accepted episcopal [[holy orders|ordination]] from sources such as Archbishop [[Pierre Martin Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Th\u1ee5c]].<ref name=UCP/>\n\nThe terms ''sedevacantist'' and ''[[sedevacantism]]'' derive from the Latin phrase ''[[sede vacante]]'' (\"while the chair/[[episcopal see|see]] [of [[Saint Peter]]] is vacant\"),<ref name=HDC/> a term normally applied to the period between the death or resignation of one pope and the election of his successor.\n\nThe best-known, and likely best-organized Sedevacantist organization is the [[Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen]] (CMRI). Many often refer to the [[Society of Saint Pius V]] (SSPV) as being a Sedevacantist organization as well; however, it has never formally adopted this position and considers the question of the validity of recent Papacies to be unresolved.\n\n===Conclavists===\n{{Main|Conclavism}}\nConclavism is the belief and practice of some who, claiming that all recent occupants of the [[Holy See|papal see]] are not true popes, elect someone else [[antipope|and propose him as the true pope]] to whom the allegiance of Catholics is due. They are often classified as sedevacantists because they reject the official papal succession for the same reasons. Conclavist groups include the\n\n* \"[[True Catholic Church]]\", founded by [[Lucian Pulvermacher]] (\"[[Antipope|Pope]] Pius XIII\")\n* [[Palmarian Catholic Church]], founded by [[Clemente Dom\u00ednguez y G\u00f3mez]] (\"Pope Gregory XVII\")\n* [[David Bawden|Pope Michael]]\n\nThe Palmarian Church has drastically altered its worship and doctrines and as such is no longer considered as 'truly' Catholic by other traditionalists.\n\n==Traditionalist positions==\n[[File:Bras\u00e3o de Dom Ant\u00f4nio de Castro Mayer.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Coat carved in a wooden door, of [[Antonio de Castro Mayer]], Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Campos|Campos]], [[Brazil]], one of the most important members of Catholic traditionalism in the world, the Lion symbolizes the fight of faith, that must be fought by Catholics.]]\n\nTraditionalist Catholics believe that they are preserving Catholic orthodoxy by not accepting all changes introduced since the [[Second Vatican Council]], changes that some of them have described as amounting to a \"veritable revolution\". They claim that the positions now taken by mainstream Catholics\u2014even conservative Catholics\u2014would have been considered \"modernist\" or \"liberal\" at the time of the Council, and that they themselves hold positions that were then considered \"conservative\" or \"traditional\".\n\nMany traditionalists further believe that errors have crept into the presentation and understanding of Catholic teachings since the time of the Council. They attribute the blame for this to liberal interpretations of the documents produced by the Second Vatican Council, to harmful post-conciliar pastoral decisions, to the text of the conciliar documents themselves, or to some combination of these.\n\nMost traditionalists view the Council as a valid, albeit problematic, [[Ecumenical Council]] of the Catholic Church, though most [[sedevacantism|sedevacantists]] regard it as wholly invalid. It is common for traditionalists in dispute with Rome to affirm that the Council was \"pastoral\", and hence that its decrees were not absolutely binding on Catholics in the same way as the dogmatic decrees of other Ecumenical Councils. Support for this view is sought in Pope John XXIII's ''Opening Address to the Council'', [[Pope Paul VI]]'s [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/speeches/1965/documents/hf_p-vi_spe_19651207_epilogo-concilio_en.html closing address], statements from Pope Benedict XVI, and the lack of formal dogmatic definitions in the Conciliar documents.\n\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] contrasted the \"hermeneutic of discontinuity and rupture\" that some apply to the Council (an interpretation adopted both by certain traditionalists and by certain \"progressives\")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2012/11/30/prefect-of-the-cdf-says-seeing-vatican-ii-as-a-rupture-is-heresy/|title=CatholicHerald.co.uk \u00bb Prefect of the CDF says seeing Vatican II as a \u2018rupture\u2019 is heresy|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opc.org/os.html?article_id=217|title=Orthodox Presbyterian Church|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> with the \"hermeneutic of reform, as it was presented first by Pope John XXIII in his Speech inaugurating the Council on 11 October 1962 and later by Pope Paul VI in his Discourse for the Council's conclusion on 7 December 1965.\"<ref name=Christmas/></blockquote> He made a similar point in a speech to the bishops of Chile in 1988, when he was still Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger:\n<blockquote>[Archbishop Lefebvre] declared that he has finally understood that the agreement he signed aimed only at integrating his foundation into the 'Conciliar Church'. The Catholic Church in union with the Pope is, according to him, the 'Conciliar Church' which has broken with its own past. It seems indeed that he is no longer able to see that we are dealing with the Catholic Church in the totality of its Tradition, and that Vatican II belongs to that.<ref name=Ratzinger:Chile>{{cite web|url=http://www.unavoce.org/cardinal_ratzinger_chile.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715080331/http://www.unavoce.org/cardinal_ratzinger_chile.htm|title=Cardinal Ratzinger's Address to Bishops of Chile|archivedate=15 July 2007|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere is some tension between different traditionalist groups at the official level: the SSPX, for example, condemns the FSSP and attendance at its Masses<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111016131146/http://sspx.org/SSPX_FAQs/q13_fraternity_of_st_peter.htm What are we to think of the Fraternity of Saint Peter?] sspx.org</ref> and is also often in conflict with other traditionalists. In fact, the common denominator that is held by all the groups identifying as traditionalist is love of the traditional form of the Mass and the other sacraments, traditional devotions, a handful of teachings that they claim have become obscured since the Second Vatican Council, and, usually, suspicion of modern \"neoconservative\" Catholicism, which is viewed as shallow, ahistorical, and intellectually dishonest. On other questions, there are a variety of opinions.\n\nMany traditionalist Catholics associate themselves with a particular priestly society. Other small groups of traditionalists sometimes form around an individual \"independent\" priest who has no ties with any particular organisation.\n\nSome leaders of [[Independent Catholic Churches]] also claim to be traditionalist Catholics and to be preserving the [[Tridentine Mass]] and ancient traditions. Examples are the [[Apostolic Catholic Church]], the [[Canonical Old Roman Catholic Church]], and the [[Fraternite Notre Dame|Fraternit\u00e9 Notre-Dame]].\n\n===Traditionalists' claims of discontinuity and rupture===\n{{More footnotes|section|date=July 2013}}\n<section begin=Modern criticism of the Catholic Church transclusion/>{{for|traditionalist criticism of the [[Second Vatican Council]]|Second Vatican Council#Objections to the council}}\nTraditionalists' claims that substantive changes have taken place in Catholic teaching and practice since the Council often crystallise around the following specific alleged examples, in which others see not what Pope Benedict XVI called \"discontinuity and rupture\", but what he called \"renewal in the continuity of the one subject-Church which the Lord has given to us\":<ref name=Christmas>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/december/documents/hf_ben_xvi_spe_20051222_roman-curia_en.html |title=Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Roman Curia offering them his Christmas greetings |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}</ref>\n* '''A new [[ecclesiology]]''' which they claim fails to recognise the Catholic Church as the one true church established by Jesus Christ, and instead holds that the Roman Catholic Church is some sub-set of the Church founded by Christ.

The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a notification on 10 August 1969, stating that, as de Nantes continued to maintain his views on the Council, the ''[[aggiornamento]]'' of the Church, the French episcopate, and the \"heresies\" of Pope Paul VI, he thereby \"disqualified the entirety of his writings and his activities\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19690810_notification-abbe-nantes_fr.html |title=Notification concerning Abb\u00e9 de Nantes |authorlink=[[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] |work=L\u2019Osservatore Romano |date=August 10, 1969 |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref> It issued another notification in 1983, published on ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' of 16\u201317 May of that year, stating that de Nantes had come to Rome to present a \"Book of Accusation against Pope John Paul II for Heresy, Schism and Scandal\", and that the Secretary of the Congregation had received him, as instructed by the Pope, but had refused to accept from him a book that contained unjustified gravely offensive accusations of the same character as those that de Nantes had directed against Pope Paul VI in a book published in 1973. It added that the refusal of de Nantes to retract his previous attacks on Pope Paul VI and the Second Vatican Council, to which he was now adding attacks on Pope John Paul II, made it impossible to believe in the sincerity of his declaration in 1978 and 1981 of a desire for the reconciliation for which the Pope remained always disposed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19830513_nantes-notification_fr.html |title=Notification concerning Abb\u00e9 Georges de Nantes |authorlink=[[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] |work=L\u2019Osservatore Romano |date=May 16\u201317, 1983 |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Responses to traditionalists' claims===\nThose who in response to these criticisms by certain traditionalists defend the decisions of the Second Vatican Council and the subsequent changes made by the Holy See make the following counterclaims:\n* They say that the criticisms are false, exaggerated, or lacking appreciation of the organic character of Tradition, and give as examples traditionalist criticisms that [[Dignitatis Humanae]] contradicts the Church's earlier teaching on religious liberty,<ref>Fr.

While liberals believe that, on sexual matters, \"the Pope can teach whatever he wants... but whether or not he should be listened to is very much an open question\", the stance of certain traditionalists on the reform of the Mass liturgy and contemporary teachings on ecumenism and religious liberty amounts to the view that, on these issues, \"faithful Catholics are always free to resist [the Pope's] folly....

They criticise non-sedevacantist traditionalists for recognising the recent Popes, on grounds such as the following:<ref>Cf. a talk available as audio files at this sedevacantist [http://www.sedevacantist.com/conference.html website]</ref>\n* They say that those non-sedevacantist traditionalists who declare that the [[Mass of Paul VI|revised]] liturgy of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] promulgated and defended by these popes undermines the faith thereby teach that the Church can decree evil and has decreed evil.\n* They say that those non-sedevacantist traditionalists who declare that the teachings of the Second Vatican Council contradict the Church's Tradition, thereby either repudiate the teaching of the [[First Vatican Council]] on the infallibility of even the ordinary and universal magisterium of the Pope and the bishops, or they implicitly deny that the Pope and bishops at the Second Vatican Council were truly the Pope and truly Catholic bishops.\n* They say that those non-sedevacantist traditionalists who consider a pope legitimate but refuse subjection to him contravene the famous Bull ''[[Unam sanctam]]'' in which [[Pope Boniface VIII]] stated: \"... we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff.\"\n* Compounding the problem, according to the sedevacantists, is the revising of the rite of Holy Orders in 1968; many believe that priests and bishops consecrated according to the new rite are invalid and could not administer traditional sacraments even if they wanted to. They say this problem applies to the FSSP and even to many SSPX priests, since the SSPX accepts priests ordained in the new rite, although it ordains its own new priests in the old. According to this line of reasoning, Benedict XVI and Francis are only priests, and never received valid episcopal consecration, and therefore have been given no true authority to be Pope, i.e., the Bishop of Rome.\n\n===Radical traditional Catholicism-critique===\n[[Integrism]] is traditionalist Catholicism that integrates social and political contexts. Kay Chadwick writes: \"It would be naive to suppose that [Catholic integrism] does not harbour a political agenda. It is both [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Masonic]] and [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]].

It faces both east and ''versus populum'' (towards the people).]]\nThe best-known and most visible sign of Catholic traditionalism is an attachment to the form that the [[Roman Rite]] liturgy of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] had before the [[Mass of Paul VI|liturgical reform]] of 1969\u20131970, in the various editions of the [[Roman Missal]] published between 1570 and 1962. This form is generally known as the [[Tridentine Mass]], though traditionalists usually prefer to call it the ''Traditional Mass''. Many refer to it as the ''[[Latin Mass]]'', though [[Latin]] is the language also of the official text of the [[post-Vatican II Mass]], to which vernacular translations are obliged to conform, and canon law states that \"the eucharistic celebration is to be carried out ''in the Latin language'' or in another language provided that the liturgical texts have been legitimately approved.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/cod-iuris-canonici/eng/documents/cic_lib4-cann879-958_en.html#Art._3 Code of Canon Law, canon 928] (emphasis added)</ref> In his 2007 [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' [[Pope Benedict XVI]] relaxed the regulations on use of the 1962 Missal, designating it \"an extraordinary form of the [[Roman Rite]], as opposed to the ordinary or normal form, as revised successively by [[Pope Paul VI]] and [[Pope John Paul II]].\"''<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070707_summorum-pontificum_en.html ''Summorum Pontificum'', art. 1]</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html Letter of Pope Benedict XVI accompanying the motu proprio ''Summorum Pontificum'']</ref>''\n\nDifferent traditionalist priests use different editions of the [[Roman Missal]] to celebrate the Tridentine Mass. Most, not only those in good standing with the Holy See but also such as those in the SSPX, use the 1962 edition, the only one that the Holy See authorises. A series of modifications to the 1962 liturgy introduced in 1965 are used by some traditionalists in good standing with Rome. This version of the liturgy is sometimes referred to as that of the \"1965 Missal\", though no new edition of the Roman Missal was in fact published in that year.\n\nA growing tendency among traditionalist groups that use the 1962 edition, such as the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]] and the [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest|Institute of Christ the King]], is to celebrate the rites of Holy Week according to how they existed prior to [[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]]'s [[Liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII|reforms of 1955]]. Special permission must be granted from the [[Holy See]], because only the 1962 typical edition is authorized by [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]] in ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''. In addition, for the [[Mass of the Presanctified]] on [[Good Friday]] priests are still forbidden to use the traditional form of the [[Good Friday prayer for the Jews]], using instead a modified version introduced by [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]] which, like [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]]'s edition of the [[Roman Missal|missal]], does not make use of the Latin word \"''perfidis''\" (\"faithless\") to describe the Jews when praying for them and also removes explicit references to their \"blindness\" and state of \"darkness\" as well as the request that God \"remove the veil from their hearts,\" instead making only oblique reference to these things.\n\nSince sedevacantists consider John XXIII not to have been a Pope, they reject the 1962 typical edition of the Roman Missal, which he promulgated. They generally use the 1920 typical edition, updated to some date previous to 1962. The [[Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen]] follows the Missal as in 1955, accepting the changes introduced by Pius XII, but others reject [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|his alteration]] of the calendar of saints and [[Liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII|his revision]] of the rites of [[Holy Week]].<ref>[http://www.strobertbellarmine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=112 ''Maxima Redemptionis''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204094636/http://www.strobertbellarmine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=112 |date=2009-02-04 }} of 16 November 1955 (AAS 47 (1955) 838\u2013847)</ref> Thus these others reject John XXIII's 1962 edition, which most notably featured the addition of [[St. Joseph]] to the enumeration of saints in the [[Canon of the Mass|Roman Canon]], and Pius XII's changes, seeing these changes as steps that led to the [[post-Vatican II Mass]]. There are no reports of priests regularly using any typical edition of the Missal earlier than that of 1920, which incorporated the rubrical and calendar changes made by Pope Pius X in 1910.<ref>Printings based on the earlier typical editions of 1884 or 1634, which immediately preceded that of 1920, would now be very difficult to find. However, the ''Libreria Editrice Vaticana'' made the ''editio princeps'' of 1570, the original Tridentine Mass as promulgated by Pope Pius V, available in reproduction in 1998 ({{ISBN|88-209-2547-8}}).</ref>\n\nLinked with the celebration of the Tridentine Mass is the observance of the liturgical calendar of saints' days as it existed before the revision of 1969 (see [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]]). Some also ignore the revisions of 1960 by Pope John XXIII, and of [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|1955 by Pope Pius XII]], and use instead the [[General Roman Calendar of 1954]].\n\n===Individual and private devotions===\nMany traditionalist Catholics lay stress on following customs prevailing immediately before the Second Vatican Council, such as the following:\n* '''Abstaining from meat on Fridays'''. Present discipline maintains Fridays and Lent as days and times of penance, declares that abstinence from meat or some other food as determined by the local [[episcopal conference]] is to be observed on all Fridays (excluding solemnities) and on Ash Wednesday, and allows episcopal conferences to permit other practices of personal penance to take the place of abstinence from meat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4O.HTM |title=Canons 1249\u20131253 of the Code of Canon Law |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}</ref>\n* '''Fasting for at least 3 hours before receiving [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]]'''.

Likewise, they are not all followed by all traditionalist Catholics at all times.\n\n===Traditionalism and the Eastern Catholic Churches===\nOpposition to the Post-Conciliar doctrine and attempts to remove [[Roman Rite]] borrowings have caused a very small Traditionalist backlash in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] as well. The dispute has been most highly publicized within the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. In some other Eastern Catholic Churches, however, there are small numbers who try to hold to practices as they were before the 1958 death of Pope Pius XII.\n\n====Background====\nThe [[Holy See]] has argued since before the Second Vatican Council that [[Liturgical Latinisation|Latinization]] was never an organic development. Frequently cited examples of this are [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s 1894 [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientalium dignitas]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13orient.htm|title=ORIENTALIUM DIGNITAS|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> and [[Saint Pius X]]'s instructions that the priests of the [[Russian Byzantine Catholic Church]] should offer the Liturgy, \"No More, No Less, and No Different,\" than the Orthodox and [[Old Ritualist]] clergy.\n\nLiturgical De-Latinization began with the 1930s corrections of the liturgical books by Metropolitan [[Andrey Sheptytsky]]. According to his biographer [[Cyril Korolevsky]], however, Metropolitan Andrey opposed the use of coercive force against those who remained attached to Latin Rite practices. He expressed fear that any attempt to do so would lead to a Greek Catholic equivalent of the [[Raskol|1666 Schism]] within the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].<ref>Cyril Korolevsky, ''Metropolitan Andrew (1868-1944)'', Translated and Edited by Fr. Serge Keleher. Stauropegion Brotherhood, Lviv, 1993.</ref>\n\nThe De-Latinisation of the UGCC gained further momentum with the 1964 decree ''[[Orientalium Ecclesiarum]]'' of the [[Second Vatican Council]]) and several subsequent documents. This resulted in the Latinisations being discarded within the [[Ukrainian diaspora]]. The Soviet annexation of Western Ukraine had meanwhile forced Byzantine Catholics into a clandestine existence and the Latinizations continued to be widely used in underground parishes, seminaries, and religious communities. After the prescription against the UGCC was lifted in 1989, numerous UGCC priests and Hierarchs arrive from the diaspora and attempted to enforce liturgical conformity. This has provoked widespread opposition.\n\n====SSPX and the Eastern churches====\nThe [[Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat]], which operates a seminary, Basilian convent, and numerous parishes, alleges ties to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, while simultaneously receiving priestly orders from the bishops of the SSPX. The PSSJ's superior, Father [[Basil Kovpak]], has accused the UGCC hierarchy of using intense psychological pressure against priests who are reluctant or unwilling to de-Latinise. He alleges that numerous laity, who have been attached to the Latinisations since the Soviet persecution of the UGCC, would prefer to stay home on Sunday rather than attend a de-Latinised liturgy.\n\nThe SSJK opposes the removal of the [[stations of the cross]], the [[rosary]] and the [[monstrance]] from the liturgy and parishes of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. They also reject the replacement of the UGCC's [[liturgical language]], [[Old Church Slavonic]], with the [[vernacular]] [[Ukrainian language]]. In his memoir ''Persecuted Tradition'', Fr. Kovpak also cites numerous examples of the UGCC turning away Orthodox clergy and laity who wish to convert to Eastern Catholicism. In many cases, he alleges, this is because the converts are not ethnically Ukrainian.\n\nIn 2003, [[Lubomyr Husar|Cardinal Lubomyr]] excommunicated SSJK superior Kovpak from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Kovpak appealed this punishment at the papal [[Sacra Rota Romana]] in [[Vatican City]] and the excommunication was declared null and void by reason of a lack of canonical form.\n\nIn 2006, the SSJK got [[Latin Church|Latin]] [[Bishop]] [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]], at that time a member of the SSPX, to ordain two priests and seven deacons in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], an action that violated canons 1015 \u00a72, 1021 and 1331 \u00a72 of the Code of Canon Law and the corresponding canons of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. Archbishop [[Ihor Vozniak]] of Lviv, the archdiocese in which the PSSJ is most active, denounced the ordinations as a \"criminal act\", and condemned Kovpak's participation in the ceremony. He stressed that the two priests whom Bishop Williamson had ordained would not receive faculties within the archeparchy.<ref>The Holy See has likewise declared SSPX priests to be \"suspended from exercising their priestly functions\" ([http://www.unavoce.org/articles/2003/perl-011803.htm Letter of Monsignor Camille Perl, Secretary of the [[Ecclesia Dei]] Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030202034019/http://www.unavoce.org/articles/2003/perl-011803.htm |date=2003-02-02 }}). A minority of them - ordained before 1976 by archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] for the SSPX - were and remained until now incardinated in several European dioceses.

It is associated in particular with attachment to the 1570{{ndash}}1970 form of the [[Roman Rite]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (the [[Tridentine Mass]]), which traditionalist Catholics call the Traditional Latin Mass or TLM or the Extraordinary Form of the Mass. \n\nTraditionalist Catholics were disturbed by the liturgical changes that followed the Second Vatican Council, which they feel stripped the liturgy of its outward sacredness and made it too Protestant, eroding faith in the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]]. Many also oppose the social teachings given by the Church during and after the Council, and see the teaching on [[ecumenism]] as blurring the distinction between Catholicism and other religions.\n\n==History==\nThe modern traditionalist movement traces its roots to at least the early 1970s, when conservative Catholics opposed to or uncomfortable with the social and liturgical changes brought about by the Second Vatican Council began to coalesce. In 1970, French Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] founded the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] (SSPX), made up of priests who would say only the Traditional Latin Mass and who stood opposed to what he saw as excessive liberal influences in the Church. Over time, Lefebvre's movement grew despite split-offs by various offshoot groups. Some Catholics, many never affiliated with Lefebvre, took the position of [[sedevacantism]], which teaches John XXIII and his successors are heretics and cannot therefore be considered popes, and that the new Church and new expressions of the sacraments are not valid. Other, marginal groups known as [[conclavism|conclavists]] have elected their own popes in opposition to the men generally considered by the world to be the true popes. The [[Society of Saint Pius V]] (SSPV) broke off from Lefebvre over its objections to the SSPX's use of the missal of [[Pope John XXIII]], preferring instead the missal in use prior to the post-1955 [[liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII]], and publicly questioning the legitimacy of the post-Vatican II popes. Lefebvre officially renounced these positions, but his movement still drew the suspicion of Roman authorities. In 1988, he and another bishop [[\u00c9c\u00f4ne consecrations|consecrated]] four men as bishops without papal permission, resulting in an ''[[Latae sententiae]]'' [[excommunication]] for all six men directly involved, not of the Society. Some members of the SSPX, unwilling to participate in what they considered [[schism]], left and founded the [[Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter]] (FSSP), which celebrates the Traditional Latin Mass but in full communion with the Holy See. During the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI, numerous attempts were made to bring the SSPX back from its separation from the authority of the Church, including the lifting of the excommunications on the four surviving bishops by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2009.<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/letters/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20090310_remissione-scomunica.html Letter of Pope Benedict XVI, 10 March 2009]</ref> These efforts failed, but the efforts of the SSPX to negotiate with Rome led to the establishment of the minority [[SSPX Resistance]].\n\n==Different types of traditionalists==\n[[File:Palm-sunday-latin-mass.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Tridentine Mass]] in a [[chapel]] of the [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Boston|Cathedral of the Holy Cross]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Palm Sunday 2009]]\nTraditionalist Catholics may be divided into four broad groups.\n\n===Traditionalists in good standing with the Holy See===\nSince the Second Vatican Council, several traditionalist organizations have been started with or have subsequently obtained approval from the Catholic Church. These organizations accept in principle the documents of the Second Vatican Council, and regard the changes associated with the Council (such as the revision of the Mass) as legitimate, if often prudentially unwise, but celebrate the older forms with the approval of the Holy See.<ref>See, for instance, the decrees of erection of the [http://www.fssp.org/en/decerec.htm Priestly Fraternity of St Peter] and of the [http://la.revue.item.free.fr/commission_pontifical.htm Institute of the Good Shepherd]</ref>\n* [[Priestly Fraternity of St Peter]] (FSSP)\n* [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]] (ICKSP)\n* [[Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer]] (FSSR)\n* [[Institute of the Good Shepherd]] (IBP)\n* Servants of Jesus and Mary ([[Servi Jesu et Mariae]], SJM)\n* [[Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem]] (CRNJ)\n* [[Canons Regular of Saint John Cantius]] (SJC)\n* [http://www.cruzios.org/ Canons Regular of the Holy Cross]\n* [[Fraternity of Saint Vincent Ferrer]]\n* [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney]] (PAASJV)\n* Miles Christi (MC)\n\nThere are also multiple monastic communities, including\n* [[Monastery of Our Lady of the Annunciation of Clear Creek]]\n* [[Monastery of St. Benedict (Norcia)|Monastery of St. Benedict in Norcia]]\n* [[Monks of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel]]\n* [[Monastery of Our Lady of the Cenacle]]\n* [[Le Barroux Abbey]]\n\nSee [[Communities using the Tridentine Mass]] for a more detailed list.\n\nIn addition, many traditionalist Catholics in good standing with Rome are served by local diocesan or religious priests who are willing and able to offer the traditional rites. Many other Catholics who sympathize with or who identify themselves as traditionalist are not able to attend the traditional liturgy regularly because it is not offered in their area (at least not with regular canonical standing) and attend the [[Mass of Paul VI]], the current ordinary or normal<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html Letter of Pope Benedict XVI accompanying his motu proprio] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''</ref> Roman Rite of Mass following the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Others may attend the liturgies of [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], if they are available. There are also numerous local and international lay organizations of traditionalist Catholics, such as the youth-groups of [[Juventutem]].\n\nTraditionalist Catholics are considered by some to differ from neo-conservatives in that the neo-conservative bases his entire belief system on the teaching of the present magisterium, while the traditionalist interprets the present with the perspective of the past.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianorder.com/features/features_2001/features_mar01.html |title=Operative Points of View |last=Ripperger |first=Chad |publisher=Christianorder.com |date=March 2001 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}</ref>\n\n===Traditionalists viewed by the Holy See as of irregular status===\nSome traditionalists receive the Sacraments from priests considered suspended ''a divinis'' by Church authorities, though these priests and the Catholics that flock to them affirm their loyalty to the Church, while at the same time affirming that teachings of the Second Vatican Council on ecumenism, religious liberty, and collegiality are inconsistent with Catholic teaching and doctrine. They form what Julie Byrne terms the right wing of [[independent Catholicism]]: \"Independents vary widely, ranging from right to left in the political spectrum. On the right traditionalist churches practice versions of Catholicism more conservative than Rome. These include the [[Society of St. Pius X]], founded by [[Marcel Lefebvre]], as well as the [[Mount St. Michael]]'s community in [[Spokane, Washington]], and actor [[Mel Gibson]]'s church in [[Malibu, California]], which made headlines when he directed the movie, ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', in 2004. \n\nThe largest priestly society to fit this description is the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] (SSPX), which was founded in 1970, with the authorisation of the bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg|Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg]], by Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]]. Members of this category view many of the post-Conciliar changes as doctrinally and pastorally unacceptable. They recognise the official Church hierarchy, while generally functioning independently of them and rejecting some decisions which they perceive as inconsistent with the Catholic faith, or ineffective in terms of catechesis and how the Catholic faith is passed down. This way of acting draws accusations of disloyalty and disobedience from many, including from members of the preceding groups that are recognised by the Holy See; on the other hand, the SSPX and groups like them consider their accusers guilty of blind obedience, which is not imposed by\u2014and can be contrary to\u2014the requirements of Catholic faith and morals. Discussions between the SSPX and the Holy See have been in progress for some years. In January 2009 the Prefect of the [[Congregation for Bishops]] remitted the excommunications which the Congregation had declared to have been incurred by the Society's bishops in 1988. Bishop [[Bernard Fellay]] of the Society expressed his gratitude for this act, though the Society has always held that the excommunications never took effect in the first place (citing canon 1323, \u00a74, canon 1323, 7 and canon 1324, \u00a73; \u00a71, 8 of the 1983 [[Code of Canon Law]]). The Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops further expressed the hope that the Society would speedily return to \"full communion\" with the Church by showing \"true fidelity and true acknowledgment of the Magisterium and the authority of the pope\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0900355.htm |title=Pope lifts excommunications of Lefebvrite bishops |publisher=Catholicnews.com |date=January 27, 2009|accessdate=2011-06-30}}</ref> The SSPX rejects the notion of \"full\" and \"partial\" communion with the Church, insisting that they belong to the Church according to the criteria given by Pope Pius XII, because they have the same faith, celebrate the same Sacraments, and recognise the same hierarchy of the Church. More recently, the Vatican has granted priests of the SSPX the authority to hear confessions and has authorised local ordinaries, in certain circumstances, to grant delegation to SSPX priests to act as the qualified witness required for valid celebration of marriage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/04/04/new_pastoral_provisions_for_sacrament_of_marriage_for_sspx/1303274|title=New pastoral provisions for Sacrament of Marriage for SSPX|access-date=2017-11-02}}</ref> In each of these documents the hope was expressed that thereby \"the process towards full institutional regularisation may be facilitated\".\n\n===Sedevacantists===\n{{Main|Sedevacantism}}\nSedevacantists hold that the post-Vatican II popes have forfeited their position through their acceptance of [[heresy|heretical teachings]] connected with the Second Vatican Council and consequently there is at present no known true pope.<ref name=HDC>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8C3TKNdn5oC&pg=PA399 |title=Historical Dictionary of Catholicism|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> They conclude, on the basis of their rejection of the revised Mass rite and their rejection of certain aspects of postconciliar Church teaching as false, that the popes involved are also false.<ref name=IUP>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUqp1_31B-MC&pg=PA257 |title=Being Right|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> This is a minority position among traditionalist Catholics<ref name=HDC/><ref name=UCP>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qd5yzP5hdiEC&pg=PA88 |title=Fundamentalisms Observed|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> and a highly divisive one,<ref name=IUP/><ref name=UCP/> so that many who hold it prefer to say nothing of their view,<ref name=IUP/> while other sedevacantists have accepted episcopal [[holy orders|ordination]] from sources such as Archbishop [[Pierre Martin Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Th\u1ee5c]].<ref name=UCP/>\n\nThe terms ''sedevacantist'' and ''[[sedevacantism]]'' derive from the Latin phrase ''[[sede vacante]]'' (\"while the chair/[[episcopal see|see]] [of [[Saint Peter]]] is vacant\"),<ref name=HDC/> a term normally applied to the period between the death or resignation of one pope and the election of his successor.\n\nThe best-known, and likely best-organized Sedevacantist organization is the [[Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen]] (CMRI). Many often refer to the [[Society of Saint Pius V]] (SSPV) as being a Sedevacantist organization as well; however, it has never formally adopted this position and considers the question of the validity of recent Papacies to be unresolved.\n\n===Conclavists===\n{{Main|Conclavism}}\nConclavism is the belief and practice of some who, claiming that all recent occupants of the [[Holy See|papal see]] are not true popes, elect someone else [[antipope|and propose him as the true pope]] to whom the allegiance of Catholics is due. They are often classified as sedevacantists because they reject the official papal succession for the same reasons. Conclavist groups include the\n\n* \"[[True Catholic Church]]\", founded by [[Lucian Pulvermacher]] (\"[[Antipope|Pope]] Pius XIII\")\n* [[Palmarian Catholic Church]], founded by [[Clemente Dom\u00ednguez y G\u00f3mez]] (\"Pope Gregory XVII\")\n* [[David Bawden|Pope Michael]]\n\nThe Palmarian Church has drastically altered its worship and doctrines and as such is no longer considered as 'truly' Catholic by other traditionalists.\n\n==Traditionalist positions==\n[[File:Bras\u00e3o de Dom Ant\u00f4nio de Castro Mayer.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Coat carved in a wooden door, of [[Antonio de Castro Mayer]], Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Campos|Campos]], [[Brazil]], one of the most important members of Catholic traditionalism in the world, the Lion symbolizes the fight of faith, that must be fought by Catholics.]]\n\nTraditionalist Catholics believe that they are preserving Catholic orthodoxy by not accepting all changes introduced since the [[Second Vatican Council]], changes that some of them have described as amounting to a \"veritable revolution\". They claim that the positions now taken by mainstream Catholics\u2014even conservative Catholics\u2014would have been considered \"modernist\" or \"liberal\" at the time of the Council, and that they themselves hold positions that were then considered \"conservative\" or \"traditional\".\n\nMany traditionalists further believe that errors have crept into the presentation and understanding of Catholic teachings since the time of the Council. They attribute the blame for this to liberal interpretations of the documents produced by the Second Vatican Council, to harmful post-conciliar pastoral decisions, to the text of the conciliar documents themselves, or to some combination of these.\n\nMost traditionalists view the Council as a valid, albeit problematic, [[Ecumenical Council]] of the Catholic Church, though most [[sedevacantism|sedevacantists]] regard it as wholly invalid. It is common for traditionalists in dispute with Rome to affirm that the Council was \"pastoral\", and hence that its decrees were not absolutely binding on Catholics in the same way as the dogmatic decrees of other Ecumenical Councils. Support for this view is sought in Pope John XXIII's ''Opening Address to the Council'', [[Pope Paul VI]]'s [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/speeches/1965/documents/hf_p-vi_spe_19651207_epilogo-concilio_en.html closing address], statements from Pope Benedict XVI, and the lack of formal dogmatic definitions in the Conciliar documents.\n\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] contrasted the \"hermeneutic of discontinuity and rupture\" that some apply to the Council (an interpretation adopted both by certain traditionalists and by certain \"progressives\")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2012/11/30/prefect-of-the-cdf-says-seeing-vatican-ii-as-a-rupture-is-heresy/|title=CatholicHerald.co.uk \u00bb Prefect of the CDF says seeing Vatican II as a \u2018rupture\u2019 is heresy|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opc.org/os.html?article_id=217|title=Orthodox Presbyterian Church|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> with the \"hermeneutic of reform, as it was presented first by Pope John XXIII in his Speech inaugurating the Council on 11 October 1962 and later by Pope Paul VI in his Discourse for the Council's conclusion on 7 December 1965.\"<ref name=Christmas/></blockquote> He made a similar point in a speech to the bishops of Chile in 1988, when he was still Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger:\n<blockquote>[Archbishop Lefebvre] declared that he has finally understood that the agreement he signed aimed only at integrating his foundation into the 'Conciliar Church'. The Catholic Church in union with the Pope is, according to him, the 'Conciliar Church' which has broken with its own past. It seems indeed that he is no longer able to see that we are dealing with the Catholic Church in the totality of its Tradition, and that Vatican II belongs to that.<ref name=Ratzinger:Chile>{{cite web|url=http://www.unavoce.org/cardinal_ratzinger_chile.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715080331/http://www.unavoce.org/cardinal_ratzinger_chile.htm|title=Cardinal Ratzinger's Address to Bishops of Chile|archivedate=15 July 2007|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere is some tension between different traditionalist groups at the official level: the SSPX, for example, condemns the FSSP and attendance at its Masses<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111016131146/http://sspx.org/SSPX_FAQs/q13_fraternity_of_st_peter.htm What are we to think of the Fraternity of Saint Peter?] sspx.org</ref> and is also often in conflict with other traditionalists. In fact, the common denominator that is held by all the groups identifying as traditionalist is love of the traditional form of the Mass and the other sacraments, traditional devotions, a handful of teachings that they claim have become obscured since the Second Vatican Council, and, usually, suspicion of modern \"neoconservative\" Catholicism, which is viewed as shallow, ahistorical, and intellectually dishonest. On other questions, there are a variety of opinions.\n\nMany traditionalist Catholics associate themselves with a particular priestly society. Other small groups of traditionalists sometimes form around an individual \"independent\" priest who has no ties with any particular organisation.\n\nSome leaders of [[Independent Catholic Churches]] also claim to be traditionalist Catholics and to be preserving the [[Tridentine Mass]] and ancient traditions. Examples are the [[Apostolic Catholic Church]], the [[Canonical Old Roman Catholic Church]], and the [[Fraternite Notre Dame|Fraternit\u00e9 Notre-Dame]].\n\n===Traditionalists' claims of discontinuity and rupture===\n{{More footnotes|section|date=July 2013}}\n<section begin=Modern criticism of the Catholic Church transclusion/>{{for|traditionalist criticism of the [[Second Vatican Council]]|Second Vatican Council#Objections to the council}}\nTraditionalists' claims that substantive changes have taken place in Catholic teaching and practice since the Council often crystallise around the following specific alleged examples, in which others see not what Pope Benedict XVI called \"discontinuity and rupture\", but what he called \"renewal in the continuity of the one subject-Church which the Lord has given to us\":<ref name=Christmas>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/december/documents/hf_ben_xvi_spe_20051222_roman-curia_en.html |title=Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Roman Curia offering them his Christmas greetings |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}</ref>\n* '''A new [[ecclesiology]]''' which they claim fails to recognise the Catholic Church as the one true church established by Jesus Christ, and instead holds that the Roman Catholic Church is some sub-set of the Church founded by Christ.

The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a notification on 10 August 1969, stating that, as de Nantes continued to maintain his views on the Council, the ''[[aggiornamento]]'' of the Church, the French episcopate, and the \"heresies\" of Pope Paul VI, he thereby \"disqualified the entirety of his writings and his activities\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19690810_notification-abbe-nantes_fr.html |title=Notification concerning Abb\u00e9 de Nantes |authorlink=[[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] |work=L\u2019Osservatore Romano |date=August 10, 1969 |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref> It issued another notification in 1983, published on ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' of 16\u201317 May of that year, stating that de Nantes had come to Rome to present a \"Book of Accusation against Pope John Paul II for Heresy, Schism and Scandal\", and that the Secretary of the Congregation had received him, as instructed by the Pope, but had refused to accept from him a book that contained unjustified gravely offensive accusations of the same character as those that de Nantes had directed against Pope Paul VI in a book published in 1973. It added that the refusal of de Nantes to retract his previous attacks on Pope Paul VI and the Second Vatican Council, to which he was now adding attacks on Pope John Paul II, made it impossible to believe in the sincerity of his declaration in 1978 and 1981 of a desire for the reconciliation for which the Pope remained always disposed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19830513_nantes-notification_fr.html |title=Notification concerning Abb\u00e9 Georges de Nantes |authorlink=[[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] |work=L\u2019Osservatore Romano |date=May 16\u201317, 1983 |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Responses to traditionalists' claims===\nThose who in response to these criticisms by certain traditionalists defend the decisions of the Second Vatican Council and the subsequent changes made by the Holy See make the following counterclaims:\n* They say that the criticisms are false, exaggerated, or lacking appreciation of the organic character of Tradition, and give as examples traditionalist criticisms that [[Dignitatis Humanae]] contradicts the Church's earlier teaching on religious liberty,<ref>Fr.

While liberals believe that, on sexual matters, \"the Pope can teach whatever he wants... but whether or not he should be listened to is very much an open question\", the stance of certain traditionalists on the reform of the Mass liturgy and contemporary teachings on ecumenism and religious liberty amounts to the view that, on these issues, \"faithful Catholics are always free to resist [the Pope's] folly....

They criticise non-sedevacantist traditionalists for recognising the recent Popes, on grounds such as the following:<ref>Cf. a talk available as audio files at this sedevacantist [http://www.sedevacantist.com/conference.html website]</ref>\n* They say that those non-sedevacantist traditionalists who declare that the [[Mass of Paul VI|revised]] liturgy of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] promulgated and defended by these popes undermines the faith thereby teach that the Church can decree evil and has decreed evil.\n* They say that those non-sedevacantist traditionalists who declare that the teachings of the Second Vatican Council contradict the Church's Tradition, thereby either repudiate the teaching of the [[First Vatican Council]] on the infallibility of even the ordinary and universal magisterium of the Pope and the bishops, or they implicitly deny that the Pope and bishops at the Second Vatican Council were truly the Pope and truly Catholic bishops.\n* They say that those non-sedevacantist traditionalists who consider a pope legitimate but refuse subjection to him contravene the famous Bull ''[[Unam sanctam]]'' in which [[Pope Boniface VIII]] stated: \"... we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff.\"\n* Compounding the problem, according to the sedevacantists, is the revising of the rite of Holy Orders in 1968; many believe that priests and bishops consecrated according to the new rite are invalid and could not administer traditional sacraments even if they wanted to. They say this problem applies to the FSSP and even to many SSPX priests, since the SSPX accepts priests ordained in the new rite, although it ordains its own new priests in the old. According to this line of reasoning, Benedict XVI and Francis are only priests, and never received valid episcopal consecration, and therefore have been given no true authority to be Pope, i.e., the Bishop of Rome.\n\n===Radical traditional Catholicism-critique===\n[[Integrism]] is traditionalist Catholicism that integrates social and political contexts.

Many refer to it as the ''[[Latin Mass]]'', though [[Latin]] is the language also of the official text of the [[post-Vatican II Mass]], to which vernacular translations are obliged to conform, and canon law states that \"the eucharistic celebration is to be carried out ''in the Latin language'' or in another language provided that the liturgical texts have been legitimately approved.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/cod-iuris-canonici/eng/documents/cic_lib4-cann879-958_en.html#Art._3 Code of Canon Law, canon 928] (emphasis added)</ref> In his 2007 [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' [[Pope Benedict XVI]] relaxed the regulations on use of the 1962 Missal, designating it \"an'' extraordinary form of the [[Roman Rite]], as opposed to ''the'' ordinary or normal form, as revised successively by [[Pope Paul VI]] and [[Pope John Paul II]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070707_summorum-pontificum_en.html ''Summorum Pontificum'', art. 1]</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html Letter of Pope Benedict XVI accompanying the motu proprio ''Summorum Pontificum'']</ref>\n\nDifferent traditionalist priests use different editions of the [[Roman Missal]] to celebrate the Tridentine Mass. Most, not only those in good standing with the Holy See but also such as those in the SSPX, use the 1962 edition, the only one that the Holy See authorises. A series of modifications to the 1962 liturgy introduced in 1965 are used by some traditionalists in good standing with Rome. This version of the liturgy is sometimes referred to as that of the \"1965 Missal\", though no new edition of the Roman Missal was in fact published in that year. The [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]], in an effort to get around the 1955 Holy Week reforms of Pius XII, which are part of the 1962 edition, has requested special permission from the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei|Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'']] for provisional use of the older Holy Week rites \"''ad experimentum'',\" beginning in 2018 and running through Holy Week 2020, at which point it will be determined whether the Holy See will grant a broader permission.\n\nSince sedevacantists consider John XXIII not to have been a Pope, they reject the 1962 typical edition of the Roman Missal, which he promulgated. They generally use the 1920 typical edition, updated to some date previous to 1962. The [[Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen]] follows the Missal as in 1955, accepting the changes introduced by Pius XII, but others reject [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|his alteration]] of the calendar of saints and [[Liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII|his revision]] of the rites of [[Holy Week]].<ref>[http://www.strobertbellarmine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=112 ''Maxima Redemptionis''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204094636/http://www.strobertbellarmine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=112 |date=2009-02-04 }} of 16 November 1955 (AAS 47 (1955) 838\u2013847)</ref> Thus these others reject John XXIII's 1962 edition, which most notably featured the addition of [[St. Joseph]] to the enumeration of saints in the [[Canon of the Mass|Roman Canon]], and Pius XII's changes, seeing these changes as steps that led to the [[post-Vatican II Mass]]. There are no reports of priests regularly using any typical edition of the Missal earlier than that of 1920, which incorporated the rubrical and calendar changes made by Pope Pius X in 1910.<ref>Printings based on the earlier typical editions of 1884 or 1634, which immediately preceded that of 1920, would now be very difficult to find. However, the ''Libreria Editrice Vaticana'' made the ''editio princeps'' of 1570, the original Tridentine Mass as promulgated by Pope Pius V, available in reproduction in 1998 ({{ISBN|88-209-2547-8}}).</ref>\n\nLinked with the celebration of the Tridentine Mass is the observance of the liturgical calendar of saints' days as it existed before the revision of 1969 (see [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]]). Some also ignore the revisions of 1960 by Pope John XXIII, and of [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|1955 by Pope Pius XII]], and use instead the [[General Roman Calendar of 1954]].\n\n===Individual and private devotions===\nMany traditionalist Catholics lay stress on following customs prevailing immediately before the Second Vatican Council, such as the following:\n* '''Abstaining from meat on Fridays'''. Present discipline maintains Fridays and Lent as days and times of penance, declares that abstinence from meat or some other food as determined by the local [[episcopal conference]] is to be observed on all Fridays (excluding solemnities) and on Ash Wednesday, and allows episcopal conferences to permit other practices of personal penance to take the place of abstinence from meat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4O.HTM |title=Canons 1249\u20131253 of the Code of Canon Law |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}</ref>\n* '''Fasting for at least 3 hours before receiving [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]]'''.

Likewise, they are not all followed by all traditionalist Catholics at all times.\n\n===Traditionalism and the Eastern Catholic Churches===\nOpposition to the Post-Conciliar doctrine and attempts to remove [[Roman Rite]] borrowings have caused a very small Traditionalist backlash in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] as well. The dispute has been most highly publicized within the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. In some other Eastern Catholic Churches, however, there are small numbers who try to hold to practices as they were before the 1958 death of Pope Pius XII.\n\n====Background====\nThe [[Holy See]] has argued since before the Second Vatican Council that [[Liturgical Latinisation|Latinization]] was never an organic development. Frequently cited examples of this are [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s 1894 [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientalium dignitas]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13orient.htm|title=ORIENTALIUM DIGNITAS|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref> and [[Saint Pius X]]'s instructions that the priests of the [[Russian Byzantine Catholic Church]] should offer the Liturgy, \"No More, No Less, and No Different,\" than the Orthodox and [[Old Ritualist]] clergy.\n\nLiturgical De-Latinization began with the 1930s corrections of the liturgical books by Metropolitan [[Andrey Sheptytsky]]. According to his biographer [[Cyril Korolevsky]], however, Metropolitan Andrey opposed the use of coercive force against those who remained attached to Latin Rite practices. He expressed fear that any attempt to do so would lead to a Greek Catholic equivalent of the [[Raskol|1666 Schism]] within the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].<ref>Cyril Korolevsky, ''Metropolitan Andrew (1868-1944)'', Translated and Edited by Fr. Serge Keleher. Stauropegion Brotherhood, Lviv, 1993.</ref>\n\nThe De-Latinisation of the UGCC gained further momentum with the 1964 decree ''[[Orientalium Ecclesiarum]]'' of the [[Second Vatican Council]]) and several subsequent documents. This resulted in the Latinisations being discarded within the [[Ukrainian diaspora]]. The Soviet annexation of Western Ukraine had meanwhile forced Byzantine Catholics into a clandestine existence and the Latinizations continued to be widely used in underground parishes, seminaries, and religious communities. After the prescription against the UGCC was lifted in 1989, numerous UGCC priests and Hierarchs arrive from the diaspora and attempted to enforce liturgical conformity. This has provoked widespread opposition.\n\n====SSPX and the Eastern churches====\nThe [[Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat]], which operates a seminary, Basilian convent, and numerous parishes, alleges ties to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, while simultaneously receiving priestly orders from the bishops of the SSPX. The PSSJ's superior, Father [[Basil Kovpak]], has accused the UGCC hierarchy of using intense psychological pressure against priests who are reluctant or unwilling to de-Latinise. He alleges that numerous laity, who have been attached to the Latinisations since the Soviet persecution of the UGCC, would prefer to stay home on Sunday rather than attend a de-Latinised liturgy.\n\nThe SSJK opposes the removal of the [[stations of the cross]], the [[rosary]] and the [[monstrance]] from the liturgy and parishes of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. They also reject the replacement of the UGCC's [[liturgical language]], [[Old Church Slavonic]], with the [[vernacular]] [[Ukrainian language]]. In his memoir ''Persecuted Tradition'', Fr. Kovpak also cites numerous examples of the UGCC turning away Orthodox clergy and laity who wish to convert to Eastern Catholicism. In many cases, he alleges, this is because the converts are not ethnically Ukrainian.\n\nIn 2003, [[Lubomyr Husar|Cardinal Lubomyr]] excommunicated SSJK superior Kovpak from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Kovpak appealed this punishment at the papal [[Sacra Rota Romana]] in [[Vatican City]] and the excommunication was declared null and void by reason of a lack of canonical form.\n\nIn 2006, the SSJK got [[Latin Church|Latin]] [[Bishop]] [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]], at that time a member of the SSPX, to ordain two priests and seven deacons in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], an action that violated canons 1015 \u00a72, 1021 and 1331 \u00a72 of the Code of Canon Law and the corresponding canons of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. Archbishop [[Ihor Vozniak]] of Lviv, the archdiocese in which the PSSJ is most active, denounced the ordinations as a \"criminal act\", and condemned Kovpak's participation in the ceremony. He stressed that the two priests whom Bishop Williamson had ordained would not receive faculties within the archeparchy.<ref>The Holy See has likewise declared SSPX priests to be \"suspended from exercising their priestly functions\" ([http://www.unavoce.org/articles/2003/perl-011803.htm Letter of Monsignor Camille Perl, Secretary of the [[Ecclesia Dei]] Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030202034019/http://www.unavoce.org/articles/2003/perl-011803.htm |date=2003-02-02 }}). A minority of them - ordained before 1976 by archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] for the SSPX - were and remained until now incardinated in several European dioceses. They are thus in the same position as excommunicated Kovpak, who is incardinated in the Ukrainian Archdiocese of Lviv. The newly ordained clergy, however, are not incardinated into any Ukrainian Catholic diocese, and thus are not clergy of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church.</ref> Officials of the Lviv archdiocese said that Kovpak could face [[excommunication]], and that ''\"'he deceives the church by declaring that he is a Greek (Byzantine) Catholic priest,' while supporting a group ''[SSPX]'' that uses the old Latin liturgy exclusively, eschewing the Byzantine tradition, and does not maintain allegiance to the Holy See.\"''<ref>[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=47961 Catholic World News: Byzantine Catholics decry Lefebvrite inroads into Ukraine] The accusation of \"eschewing the Byzantine tradition\" refers to Father Kovpak's championing of Latinising elements which were followed by Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church since the 17th century, but forcibly purged following the Second Vatican Council.</ref>\n\nFather Kovpak's excommunication process was restarted by the hierarchy of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and was confirmed by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] on 23 November 2007.<ref name=\"Ukrainian priest excommunicated\">[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=54919 Ukrainian priest excommunicated] Catholic World News, November 21, 2007</ref>\n\n====Sedevacantism in an Eastern church====\nOn 3 March 2008 a group of [[Order of Saint Basil the Great|Basilian]] priests stationed in [[Pidhirtsi]], Ukraine, informed [[Pope Benedict XVI]] that four of them had been consecrated as bishops in order to save the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC) from heresy and apostasy. On 11 August 2009, they announced the formation of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church]] as a \"new Church structure for the orthodox faithful of the UGCC\", professing the Catholic faith, including the primacy of the Roman Pontiff, and disassociating themselves from \"contemporary heresies which destroy both the Eastern and the Western Church\".<ref>[http://uogcc.org.ua/en/church/article/?article=783 Decree of Establishment of the UOGCC].

Lead mining at this site goes back to at least the 17th century. The Shuttlebark vein of lead ore was officially opened in 1682. Magpie Mine is recorded back to 1740. After over 200 years of operation, Magpie Mine closed in 1958 and was the last working lead mine in Derbyshire. The Peak District Mines Historical Society now manages the site and has undertaken much restoration work.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://pdmhs.co.uk/magpie-mine-peak-district/|title=Magpie Mine - Peak District places to visit |publisher=Peak District Mines Historical Society|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n[[File:Magpie Mine 2.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Headgear of the main shaft]]\nBetween productive, profitable times, there were closures for several years in 1793 and in 1835 due to floods, disputes and drops in the price of lead. In 1833 a bitter dispute led to three miners from the neighbouring Maypitt Mine being suffocated by smoke from fires lit deliberately by miners from the Magpie Mine. A murder trial followed but all of the 24 suspected culprits were freed because they had been provoked and it was also unclear which of them was actually responsible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdmhs.co.uk/magpie-mine-peak-district-history/|title=Magpie Mine History|publisher=Peak District Mines Historical Society||language=en-US|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe renowned mining engineer [[John Taylor (mining engineer)|John Taylor]] took over management of the mine in 1839 and he established a complex of new limestone buildings and innovative equipment. The square chimney (renovated in 2016) and the circular chimney were both built in 1840. The agent\u2019s house, smithy, winding house (now demolished), circular gunpowder house and engine reservoir (to supply boiler and cooling water to the engines) were all constructed in the 1840s. In 1869 the Cornish engine house replaced an earlier engine house building and the winding engine was installed, with the winding drum that still remains. The main shaft was sunk in 1823 and is over 200m deep. The underground channel used to drain floodwater from the mines (the [[sough]]) was built from 1873 to 1881 and runs about {{convert|2|km}} to its outlet into the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]] to the north (carrying several million litres of water per day).

The walled enclosure of five lead mines (Magpie Mine, Dirty Red Soil, Great Red Soil, Maypit and Horsesteps) is a protected [[Scheduled monument|Scheduled Monument]].<ref name=\":0\">{{NHLE|num=1019490|desc=Magpie, Dirty Red Soil, Maypit, Horsesteps and Great Red Soil lead mines|accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nMid-Derbyshire has a history of industrial lead mining going back to Roman times. Lead mining at this site goes back to at least the 17th century. The Shuttlebark vein of lead ore was officially opened in 1682. Magpie Mine is recorded back to 1740. After over 200 years of operation, Magpie Mine closed in 1958 and was the last working lead mine in Derbyshire. The Peak District Mines Historical Society now manages the site and has undertaken much restoration work.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://pdmhs.co.uk/magpie-mine-peak-district/|title=Magpie Mine - Peak District places to visit {{!}} PEAK DISTRICT MINES HISTORICAL SOCIETY|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n[[File:Magpie Mine 2.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Headgear of the main shaft]]\nBetween productive, profitable times, there were closures for several years in 1793 and in 1835 due to floods, disputes and drops in the price of lead. In 1833 a bitter dispute led to three miners from the neighbouring Maypitt Mine being suffocated by smoke from fires lit deliberately by miners from the Magpie Mine. A murder trial followed but all of the 24 suspected culprits were freed because they had been provoked and it was also unclear which of them was actually responsible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdmhs.co.uk/magpie-mine-peak-district-history/|title=Magpie Mine History{{!}}Derbyshire lead mine {{!}} PEAK DISTRICT MINES HISTORICAL SOCIETY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe renowned mining engineer [[John Taylor (mining engineer)|John Taylor]] took over management of the mine in 1839 and he established a complex of new limestone buildings and innovative equipment. The square chimney (renovated in 2016) and the circular chimney were both built in 1840. The agent\u2019s house, smithy, winding house (now demolished), circular gunpowder house and engine reservoir (to supply boiler and cooling water to the engines) were all constructed in the 1840s. In 1869 the Cornish engine house replaced an earlier engine house building and the winding engine was installed, with the winding drum that still remains. The main shaft was sunk in 1823 and is over 200m deep. The underground channel used to drain floodwater from the mines (the [[sough]]) was built from 1873 to 1881 and runs about {{convert|2|km}} to its outlet into the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]] to the north (carrying several million litres of water per day). The mine closed with financial troubles in 1883. It was operating for brief spells between 1913 and 1923 but was then only reopened again in 1950, before finally closing down in 1958.

Because of limitations in the DC traction system, a decision was made to convert the electric traction system of the Mumbai suburban rail network of WR and CR from 1.5kV DC to 25 kV AC in 1996\u201397. The conversion from DC to AC traction was completed in 2012 by Western Railway, and in 2016 by Central Railway.

Heavy gradients in the [[Western Ghats]] necessitated the introduction of electric traction on the GIPR to [[Igatpuri]] on the North East line and [[Pune]] on the South East line. On 5 January 1928 1500 V DC traction was introduced on the suburban section of the [[Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway]] between [[Colaba]] and [[Borivili]], and between [[Madras]] Beach and [[Tambaram]] of the [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway]] on 11 May 1931, to meet growing traffic needs.<ref name=\"ELECT\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.core.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,302,532 |title=Brief on Railway Electrification |access-date=1 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926072829/http://www.core.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,302,532 |archive-date=26 September 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The 3000 V DC electrification of the [[Howrah]]-[[Burdwan]] section of the [[Eastern Railway Zone (India)|Eastern Railway]] was completed in 1958.

Indian Railways decided in 1957 to adopt 25 kV AC as its standard, with SNCF their consultant in the early stages. The first 25 kV AC section was Raj Kharswan\u2013Dongoaposi on the [[South Eastern Railway Zone, India|South Eastern Railway]] in 1960. The first 25 kV AC [[electric multiple unit|EMUs]], for [[Kolkata]] suburban service, began service in September 1962. For continuity, the Howrah\u2013Burdwan section of the Eastern Railway and the Madras Beach\u2013Tambaram section of the Southern Railway were converted to 25 kV AC by 1968. Because of limitations in the DC traction system, a decision was made to convert the electric traction system of the Mumbai suburban rail network of WR and CR from 1.5kV DC to 25 kV AC in 1996\u201397. The conversion from DC to AC traction was completed in 2012 by Western Railway, and in 2016 by Central Railway. Since then, the entire electrified mainline rail network in India uses 25 kV AC, and DC traction is used only for metros and trams.<ref name=\"ELECT\"/>\n\n[[File:Railway Electrification Rate for Leading & Laggard State\u2019s of India 2018.png|thumb|left|Railway electrification rate for leading and laggard states of India]]\n[[File:Railway-Electrification-Trend-&-Roadmap-for-India-till-FY-2022.png|thumb|right|Railway electrification trend and road map for India until FY 2022]]\n\nIndian Railways announced on 31 March 2017 that the country's entire rail network would be electrified by 2022.<ref name=\"indianexpress.com\"/><ref name=\"enincon1\">{{cite web|url=https://enincon.com/report/railway-electrification-market-opportunities-in-india-2018/|title=Railway Electrification Market in India 2018|date=20 February 2018|publisher=Enincon|access-date=20 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320230336/https://enincon.com/report/railway-electrification-market-opportunities-in-india-2018/|archive-date=20 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThough not a nascent concept, the electrification in India now has been committed with a fresh investment of {{INRConvert|35000|c}} to electrify the entire network and eliminate the cost of fuel under transportation which will amount to a massive savings of {{INRConvert|10500|c}} overall.
