His father, Anton Franz Hanisch was the organist of the [[Basilica of the Nativity of Our Lady, Regensburg]] ([[German Language|German]]: Alten Kapelle Regensburg). Joseph's father taught him how to play the organ and in 1829 Hanisch started serious organ lessons under Carl Proske, the organist for the [[Regensburg Cathedral]]. After an 1835 trip to Italy in search of compositions from Roman archives, Joseph took an interest in the restoration of Catholic church music.\n\nIn 1836 Joseph took over his father's position as the official organist for the Alten Kapelle Regensburg, and worked his way to becoming the organist for the [[Niederm\u00fcnster]] Cathedral in 1866. He also taught harmonica, organ, and [[musical improvisation]] lessons at the music school in Regensburg, as well as teaching the young princes [[Thurn and Taxis|The House of Thurn and Taxis]].\n\nJoseph also conducted the Regensburg choir from 1859 to 1863, and again from 1867 to 1872.\n\n== Family ==\n\nThe Hanisch family originates from Franz Xaver, born in [[Silesia]], who settled in Regensburg in the 1800s as the court oboist of The House of Thurn and Taxis. From then on, the Hanisch family had a great influence on the musical life of Regensburg.\n\nFranz Xaver Hanisch von Greifenthal (1749-?): Oboist, Piano teacher 1776 until 1806; and composer for The House of Thurn and Taxis.\n\nAnton Franz Hanisch von Greifenthal(1786-1835): Organist in the Basilica of the Nativity of Our Lady, Regensburg from 1808; Father of both Joseph and Max Joseph Hanisch.\n\nJoseph Hanisch (1812\u20131892): Cathedral Organist in Regensburg from 1829 to 1892; son of Barbara Fuhrmann.\n\nMax Joseph Hanisch (1819-1866): Organist and music teacher at St. Emmeram; Son of Anton Franz and Elisabeth Rosalia Hanisch (1799-1826).\n\nDorothea Hanisch (1854-1945):\tPianist (1786-1835): organist in the Basilica of the Nativity of Our Lady, Regensburg from 1808; father of Joseph and Max Joseph Hanisch.\n\n== Impact ==\n\nThe foundation of Josephs' compositions come from his study of [[Gregorian Chorals]], and the masters of [[church music]]. He is mostly regarded for his liturgical organ playing and improvisational skills. Through his various posts as an organist and music teacher, Joseph contributed greatly to the Regensburg musical scene. His work in restoring Catholic church music from Palestine, influenced [[Franz Xaver Witt]] to founding the [[Caecilia Society]].\n\nHis major compositions are ''Missa auxilium Christianorum'', ''Quatuor hymni pro festo corporis Christi'', and ''Konzerte f\u00fcr swei H\u00f6rner'' (English: Concert for two horns).\n\n== Works cited ==\n* {{Cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/lebensbilder-aus-der-geschichte-des-bistums-regensburg-23242/oclc/645541112&referer=brief_results |title=Lebensbilder aus der Geschichte des Bistums Regensburg 23/24,2. 23/24,2. |last=Schwaiger |first=Georg |date=1989 |publisher=Verl. des Vereins f\u00fcr Regensburger Bistumsgeschichte |location=Regensburg |language=German}}\n* {{Cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/angelus-durus-seiner-domspatzen-franz-xaver-engelhart-1861-1924-domkapellmeister-und-komponist-eine-skizze-seines-lebens-und-wirkens-sowie-ein-verzeichnis-seiner-werke/oclc/772929973&referer=brief_results |title=Angelus durus seiner Domspatzen: Franz Xaver Engelhart (1861 - 1924), Domkapellmeister und Komponist ; eine Skizze seines Lebens und Wirkens sowie ein Verzeichnis seiner Werke |last=Wagner |first=Fritz |last2=Kammerer |first2=Heinrich |date=2011 |publisher=Ebner |isbn=9783934726352 |location=Deggendorf |language=German}}\n* {{Cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/regensburger-domorganisten-zum-150-todestag-von-carl-proske-1794-1861-und-zum-80-geburtstag-von-eberhard-kraus-1931-2003-ausstellung-in-der-bischoflichen-zentralbibliothek-regensburg-st-petersweg-11-13-20-mai-bis-22-juli-2011/oclc/734051627&referer=brief_results |title=Regensburger Domorganisten: zum 150.

It serves stations between its namesake town, [[Warminster (SEPTA station)|Warminster]], and Center City, [[Philadelphia]]. Half of the route is shared by other lines, including the [[Lansdale/Doylestown Line]], [[West Trenton Line (SEPTA)|West Trenton Line]], [[Fox Chase Line]], [[Chestnut Hill East Line]], and [[Manayunk/Norristown Line]]. The great majority of trains continue as part of the [[Airport Line (SEPTA)|Airport Line]].\n\n== Route ==\nThe Warminster Line uses the [[SEPTA Main Line]] between Center City and [[Glenside (SEPTA station)|Glenside]], where it branches off onto its own line to [[Hatboro (SEPTA station)|Hatboro]] and [[Warminster (SEPTA station)|Warminster]]. The tracks continue past Warminster to [[Ivyland, Pennsylvania|Ivyland]] and eventually to [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]], where the [[New Hope Railroad]] runs heritage excursion trains.\n\nThe Warminster Line becomes a single-track line just north of [[Ardsley, Pennsylvania|Ardsley]], but was once double-tracked as far north as [[Roslyn, Pennsylvania|Roslyn]], the original northbound track being removed in 2010. A passing siding exists north of [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania|Willow Grove]]. There is also a second storage track at the Hatboro station and the line becomes double-tracked again as it approaches the terminus at Warminster station.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|North Pennsylvania Railroad}}\n[[File:Hatboro PA SEPTA station from parking lot December 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Hatboro was the extent of electrified service until 1974]]\nThe [[North Pennsylvania Railroad]] formed the [[North East Pennsylvania Railroad]] in 1870 to construct a branch from its line at Abington (as [[Glenside station|Glenside]] was then known) to [[Hatboro station|Hatboro]]. The line opened on December 18, 1872.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEYjAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA675 | title=North Pennsylvania Railroad | journal=American Railroad Journal | date=May 30, 1874 | volume=XXX | issue=22 | pages=675}}</ref> The line was further extended to [[Hartsville, Pennsylvania|Hartsville]] on November 9, 1874.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlUjAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA706&lpg=PA706 | title=North Pennsylvania Railroad | journal=American Railroad Journal | date=June 5, 1875 | volume=XXXI | issue=28 | page=6}}</ref> The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, forerunner of the [[Reading Company]] (RDG), leased the parent North Pennsylvania Railroad in 1879, gaining control of the line. It extended the line to its final terminus at [[New Hope station|New Hope]] on April 29, 1891.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBU-AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1049 | title=North East Pennsylvania Railroad | journal=[[Poor's Manual of Railroads]] | year=1917 | pages=1049}}</ref> The Reading electrified the line, which it called the '''New Hope Branch''', as far as Hatboro on July 26, 1931.<ref>{{Williams-Philadelphia|page=46}}</ref>\n \nIn 1952, all passenger service ceased north of Hatboro to New Hope, with every station except Rushland, Wycombe, Lahaska and New Hope being demolished in 1954. Between 1952 and 1966, only freight trains traveled north of Hatboro to serve customers in Warminster, Ivyland, Rushland, Buckingham and New Hope. In 1966, the [[New Hope & Ivyland Railroad]] (NHIR) was launched and purchased 16 miles of track from Ivyland to New Hope. After 1966, Ivyland served as a freight interchange between RDG and NHIR and the RDG relabeled their remaining ownership of the line as the Warminster Branch. Not only did they transport freight, but also run scenic heritage excursions, originally from New Hope to Buckingham, but has been cutback to Lahaska in the 1980s. However, passenger service between Warminster and Hatboro was still inactive.\n\nIn 1971, RDG filed for bankruptcy after a variety of misfortunes; among them are increased use of trucks and a dwindling economy. The court issued a bankruptcy protection so RDG can still operate. On July 29, 1974, passenger service was reinstated after RDG completed an extension of the electrification from Hatboro (the original electrified terminus) to Warminster. Willow Grove and Warminster stations were also rebuilt in the same year. By that time, executives of RDG didn't see their debt becoming any better. Less than two years later, RDG's rolling stock, right-of-ways, interests and stock were in the hands of [[Conrail]], also known as the Consolidated Rail Corporation, which launched operations on April 1, 1976. In 1983, SEPTA took control of the Warminster Branch.\n\n[[File:R2 Warminster.gif|left]]\nBeginning in 1984 the route was designated '''R2 Warminster''' as part of SEPTA's [[SEPTA Regional Rail#The tunnel|diametrical reorganization]] of its lines. Warminster Line trains operated through the city center to the [[Wilmington/Newark Line]] (then Marcus Hook) on the ex-Pennsylvania side of the system.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Vuchic | first1=Vukan |

It serves stations between its namesake town, [[Warminster (SEPTA station)|Warminster]], and Center City, [[Philadelphia]]. Half of the route is shared by other lines, including the [[Lansdale/Doylestown Line]], [[West Trenton Line (SEPTA)|West Trenton Line]], [[Fox Chase Line]], [[Chestnut Hill East Line]], and [[Manayunk/Norristown Line]]. The great majority of trains continue as part of the [[Airport Line (SEPTA)|Airport Line]].\n\n== Route ==\nThe Warminster Line uses the [[SEPTA Main Line]] between Center City and [[Glenside (SEPTA station)|Glenside]], where it branches off onto its own line to [[Hatboro (SEPTA station)|Hatboro]] and [[Warminster (SEPTA station)|Warminster]]. The tracks continue past Warminster to [[Ivyland, Pennsylvania|Ivyland]] and eventually to [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]], where the [[New Hope Railroad]] runs heritage excursion trains.\n\nThe Warminster Line becomes a single-track line just north of [[Ardsley, Pennsylvania|Ardsley]], but was once double-tracked as far north as [[Roslyn, Pennsylvania|Roslyn]], the original northbound track being removed in 2010. A passing siding exists north of [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania|Willow Grove]]. There is also a second storage track at the Hatboro station and the line becomes double-tracked again as it approaches the terminus at Warminster station.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|North Pennsylvania Railroad}}\n[[File:Hatboro PA SEPTA station from parking lot December 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Hatboro was the extent of electrified service until 1974]]\nThe [[North Pennsylvania Railroad]] formed the [[North East Pennsylvania Railroad]] in 1870 to construct a branch from its line at Abington (as [[Glenside station|Glenside]] was then known) to [[Hatboro station|Hatboro]]. The line opened on December 18, 1872.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEYjAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA675 | title=North Pennsylvania Railroad | journal=American Railroad Journal | date=May 30, 1874 | volume=XXX | issue=22 | pages=675}}</ref> The line was further extended to [[Hartsville, Pennsylvania|Hartsville]] on November 9, 1874.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlUjAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA706&lpg=PA706 | title=North Pennsylvania Railroad | journal=American Railroad Journal | date=June 5, 1875 | volume=XXXI | issue=28 | page=6}}</ref> The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, forerunner of the [[Reading Company]] (RDG), leased the parent North Pennsylvania Railroad in 1879, gaining control of the line. It extended the line to its final terminus at [[New Hope station|New Hope]] on April 29, 1891.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBU-AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1049 | title=North East Pennsylvania Railroad | journal=[[Poor's Manual of Railroads]] | year=1917 | pages=1049}}</ref> The Reading electrified the line, which it called the '''New Hope Branch''', as far as Hatboro on July 26, 1931.<ref>{{Williams-Philadelphia|page=46}}</ref>\n \nIn 1952, all passenger service ceased north of Hatboro to New Hope, with every station except Rushland, Wycombe, Lahaska and New Hope being demolished in 1954. Between 1952 and 1966, only freight trains traveled north of Hatboro to serve customers in Warminster, Ivyland, Rushland, Buckingham and New Hope. In 1966, the [[New Hope & Ivyland Railroad]] (NHIR) was launched and purchased 16 miles of track from Ivyland to New Hope. After 1966, Ivyland served as a freight interchange between RDG and NHIR and the RDG relabeled their remaining ownership of the line as the Warminster Branch. Not only did they transport freight, but also run scenic heritage excursions, originally from New Hope to Buckingham, but has been cutback to Lahaska in the 1980s. However, passenger service between Warminster and Hatboro was still inactive.\n\nIn 1971, RDG filed for bankruptcy after a variety of misfortunes; among them are increased use of trucks and a dwindling economy. The court issued a bankruptcy protection so RDG can still operate. On July 29, 1974, passenger service was reinstated after RDG completed an extension of the electrification from Hatboro (the original electrified terminus) to Warminster. Willow Grove and Warminster stations were also rebuilt in the same year. By that time, executives of RDG didn't see their debt becoming any better. Less than two years later, RDG's rolling stock, right-of-ways, interests and stock were in the hands of [[Conrail]], also known as the Consolidated Rail Corporation, which launched operations on April 1, 1976. In 1983, SEPTA took control of the Warminster Branch.\n\n[[File:R2 Warminster.gif|left]]\nBeginning in 1984 the route was designated '''R2 Warminster''' as part of SEPTA's [[SEPTA Regional Rail#The tunnel|diametrical reorganization]] of its lines. Warminster Line trains operated through the city center to the [[Wilmington/Newark Line]] (then Marcus Hook) on the ex-Pennsylvania side of the system.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Vuchic | first1=Vukan |

The benefits of CAD systems over manual drafting are the capabilities one often takes for granted from computer systems today;  automated generation of [[Bill of materials|bills of materials]], auto layout in [[integrated circuits]], interference checking, and many others. Eventually, CAD provided the designer with the ability to perform engineering calculations. During this transition, calculations were still performed either by hand or by those individuals who could run computer programs. CAD was a revolutionary change in the engineering industry, where draftsmen, designers and engineering roles begin to merge. It did not eliminate departments as much as it merged departments and empowered draftsman, designers, and engineers. CAD is an example of the pervasive effect computers were beginning to have on industry.\nCurrent computer-aided design software packages range from 2D [[vector graphics|vector]]-based drafting systems to 3D [[Solid modeling|solid]] and [[Freeform surface modelling|surface]] modelers. Modern CAD packages can also frequently allow rotations in three dimensions, allowing viewing of a designed object from any desired angle, even from the inside looking out. Some CAD software is capable of dynamic mathematical modeling.\n\nCAD technology is used in the design of tools and machinery and in the drafting and design of all types of buildings, from small residential types (houses) to the largest commercial and industrial structures (hospitals and factories).<ref>{{cite web\n | title = 3D Model-Based Design: Setting the Definitions Straight\n | author = Jennifer Herron\n | publisher = MCADCafe\n | year = 2010\n | url = http://www10.mcadcafe.com/nbc/articles/2/867959/3D-Model-Based-Design-Setting-Definitions-Straight\n}}</ref>\n\nCAD is mainly used for detailed engineering of 3D models or 2D drawings of physical components, but it is also used throughout the engineering process from conceptual design and layout of products, through strength and dynamic analysis of assemblies to definition of manufacturing methods of components. It can also be used to design objects such as jewelry, furniture, appliances, etc. Furthermore, many CAD applications now offer advanced rendering and animation capabilities so engineers can better visualize their product designs. [[4D BIM]] is a type of virtual construction engineering simulation incorporating time or schedule related information for project management.\n\nCAD has become an especially important technology within the scope of [[CAx|computer-aided technologies]], with benefits such as lower product development costs and a greatly shortened [[Systems development life cycle#Design|design cycle]]. CAD enables designers to layout and develop work on screen, print it out and save it for future editing, saving time on their drawings.\n\n==Uses==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nComputer-aided design is one of the many tools used by engineers and designers and is used in many ways depending on the profession of the user and the type of software in question.\n\nCAD is one part of the whole digital product development (DPD) activity within the [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM) processes, and as such is used together with other tools, which are either integrated modules or stand-alone products, such as:\n\n*[[Computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) and [[finite element analysis]] (FEA, FEM)\n*[[Computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) including instructions to [[computer numerical control]] (CNC) machines\n*[[Photorealistic rendering]] and motion simulation.\n*Document management and [[revision control]] using [[product data management]] (PDM).\n\nCAD is also used for the accurate creation of photo simulations that are often required in the preparation of environmental impact reports, in which computer-aided designs of intended buildings are superimposed into photographs of existing environments to represent what that locale will be like, where the proposed facilities are allowed to be built. Potential blockage of view corridors and shadow studies are also frequently analyzed through the use of CAD.\n\nCAD has been proven to be useful to engineers as well. Using four properties which are history, features, parametrization, and high-level constraints. The construction history can be used to look back into the model's personal features and work on the single area rather than the whole model. Parameters and constraints can be used to determine the size, shape, and other properties of the different modeling elements. The features in the CAD system can be used for the variety of tools for measurement such as tensile strength, yield strength, electrical or electromagnetic properties. Also its stress, strain, [[Timing closure|timing]] or how the element gets affected in certain temperatures, etc.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:CAD Modeling.gif|thumb|A simple procedure]]\n{{see also|Comparison of computer-aided design editors}}\nThere are several different types of CAD,<ref>{{cite web| title = 3D Feature-based, Parametric Solid Modeling| work = engineershandbook.com| url = http://engineershandbook.com/Software/cad2.htm#3dp| access-date = 2012-03-01| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121118110426/http://www.engineershandbook.com/Software/cad2.htm#3dp| archive-date = 2012-11-18| url-status = dead}}</ref> each requiring the operator to think differently about how to use them and design their virtual components in a different manner for each.\n\nThere are many producers of the lower-end 2D systems, including a number of free and open-source programs. These provide an approach to the drawing process without all the fuss over scale and placement on the drawing sheet that accompanied hand drafting since these can be adjusted as required during the creation of the final draft.\n\n''3D [[Wire-frame model|wireframe]]'' is basically an extension of 2D drafting (not often used today). Each line has to be manually inserted into the drawing. The final product has no mass properties associated with it and cannot have features directly added to it, such as holes. The operator approaches these in a similar fashion to the 2D systems, although many 3D systems allow using the wireframe model to make the final engineering drawing views.\n\n''3D \"dumb\" solids'' are created in a way analogous to manipulations of real-world objects (not often used today). Basic three-dimensional geometric forms (prisms, cylinders, spheres, and so on) have solid volumes added or subtracted from them as if assembling or cutting real-world objects. Two-dimensional projected views can easily be generated from the models. Basic 3D solids don't usually include tools to easily allow motion of components, set limits to their motion, or identify interference between components.\n\nThere are two types of ''3D [[solid modeling]]''\n\n* ''Parametric modeling'' allows the operator to use what is referred to as \"design intent\". The objects and features created are modifiable. Any future modifications can be made by changing how the original part was created. If a feature was intended to be located from the center of the part, the operator should locate it from the center of the model. The feature could be located using any geometric object already available in the part, but this random placement would defeat the design intent. If the operator designs the part as it functions the parametric modeler is able to make changes to the part while maintaining geometric and functional relationships.\n* ''[[Explicit modeling|Direct or explicit modeling]]'' provide the ability to edit geometry without a history tree. With direct modeling, once a sketch is used to create geometry the sketch is incorporated into the new geometry and the designer just modifies the geometry without needing the original sketch. As with parametric modeling, [[direct modeling]] has the ability to include relationships between selected geometry (e.g., tangency, concentricity).\n\nTop end systems offer the capabilities to incorporate more organic, aesthetics and ergonomic features into designs. [[Freeform surface modeling]] is often combined with solids to allow the designer to create products that fit the human form and visual requirements as well as they interface with the machine.\n\n==Technology==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:cad mouse 1.svg|right|thumb|A CAD model of a [[Mouse (computing)|computer mouse]]]]\n\nOriginally software for CAD systems was developed with computer languages such as [[Fortran]], [[ALGOL]] but with the advancement of [[object-oriented programming]] methods this has radically changed. Typical modern [[parametric feature-based modeler]] and [[freeform surface]] systems are built around a number of key [[C (programming language)|C]] modules with their own [[application programming interface|API]]s. A CAD system can be seen as built up from the interaction of a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) with [[NURBS]] geometry or [[boundary representation]] (B-rep) data via a [[geometric modeling kernel]]. A geometry constraint engine may also be employed to manage the associative relationships between geometry, such as wireframe geometry in a sketch or components in an assembly.\n\nUnexpected capabilities of these associative relationships have led to a new form of [[prototyping]] called [[digital prototyping]]. In contrast to physical prototypes, which entail manufacturing time in the design. That said, CAD models can be generated by a computer after the physical prototype has been scanned using an [[industrial CT scanning]] machine. Depending on the nature of the business, digital or physical prototypes can be initially chosen according to specific needs.\n\nToday, CAD systems exist for all the major platforms ([[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[UNIX]] and [[Mac OS X]]); some packages support multiple platforms.\n\nCurrently, no special hardware is required for most CAD software. However, some CAD systems can do graphically and computationally intensive tasks, so a modern [[graphics card]], high speed (and possibly multiple) [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s and large amounts of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] may be recommended.\n\nThe human-machine interface is generally via a [[computer mouse]] but can also be via a pen and digitizing [[graphics tablet]]. Manipulation of the view of the model on the screen is also sometimes done with the use of a [[3Dconnexion|Spacemouse/SpaceBall]]. Some systems also support stereoscopic glasses for [[Scientific visualization|viewing the 3D model]]. Technologies which in the past were limited to larger installations or specialist applications have become available to a wide group of users. These include the [[Cave automatic virtual environment|CAVE]] or [[Virtual reality|HMDs]] and interactive [[Leap Motion|devices]] like motion-sensing [[Kinect|technology]]\n\n==Software==\nCAD software enables engineers and architects to design, inspect and manage engineering projects within an integrated [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) on a [[personal computer]] system. Most applications support [[solid modeling]] with [[boundary representation]] (B-Rep) and [[NURBS]] geometry, and enable the same to be published in a variety of formats. A [[geometric modeling kernel]] is a software component that provides solid modeling and surface modeling features to CAD applications.\n\nBased on market statistics, [[commercial software]] from Autodesk, Dassault Systems, Siemens PLM Software, and PTC dominate the CAD industry.<ref>[http://caewatch.com/the-big-6-in-cadcaeplm-software-industry-2011/ The Big 6 in CAD/CAE/PLM software industry (2011)], CAEWatch, September 12, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.softwaretop100.org/global-software-top-100-edition-2011|title=GLOBAL SOFTWARE TOP 100 \u2013 EDITION 2011|publisher=Software Top 100|date=2011-08-23|first=Michel|last=van Kooten}}</ref> The following is a list of major CAD applications, grouped by usage statistics.<ref name=\"bm\">[http://www.beyondmech.com/pro-e/cad-topic-33.html List of mechanical CAD softwares], BeyondMech</ref>\n\n{{colbegin|colwidth=}}\n\n===Commercial===\n{{sort list|asc|\n* [[Alibre Design]]\n* [[AllyCAD]]\n* Autodesk [[AutoCAD]]\n* [[Autodesk Inventor]]\n* [[Promine]]\n* [[AxSTREAM]]\n* [[Bentley Systems]] - [[MicroStation]]\n* Bricsys [[BricsCAD]]\n* Dassault Systemes [[CATIA]]\n* Dassault Systemes [[SolidWorks]]\n* Kubotek [[KeyCreator]]\n* [[Siemens NX]]\n* Siemens [[Solid Edge]]\n* PTC [[PTC Creo]] (formerly known as Pro/ENGINEER)\n* [[T-FLEX CAD]]\n* Trimble [[SketchUp]]\n* AgiliCity [[Modelur]]\n* [[TurboCAD]]\n* [[IRONCAD]]\n* [[MEDUSA]]\n* [[ProgeCAD]]\n* [[SpaceClaim]]\n* [[PunchCAD]]\n* [[Rhinoceros 3D]]\n* [[VariCAD]]\n* [[Cobalt (CAD program)|Cobalt]]\n* [[RoutCad]]\n* [[SketchUp]]\n* [[Onshape]]\n* [[Remo 3D]]\n}}\n\n===Freeware and open source===\n* [[123D]]\n* [[BRL-CAD]]\n*[[BricsCAD#BricsCAD_Shape|BricsCAD Shape]]\n* [[FreeCAD]]\n* [[LibreCAD]]\n* [[QCAD]]\n* [[OpenSCAD]]\n* [[SolveSpace]]\n\n===CAD kernels===\n* [[Parasolid]] by Siemens\n* [[ACIS]] by Spatial\n* [[ShapeManager]] by Autodesk\n* [[Open CASCADE]] Open Source\n* [[C3D Toolkit|C3D]] by C3D Labs\n{{colend}}\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[3D computer graphics software]]\n* [[3D printing]]\n* [[Additive Manufacturing File Format]]\n* [[CAD standards]]\n* [[Coarse space (numerical analysis)]]\n* [[Comparison of 3D computer graphics software]]\n* [[Comparison of computer-aided design editors]]\n* [[Comparison of CAD, CAM and CAE file viewers]]\n* [[Comparison of Free EDA software]] (Electronic Design Automation)\n* [[Computer-aided industrial design]]\n* [[Digital architecture]]\n* [[Electronic design automation]]\n* [[Engineering optimization]]\n* [[Finite element method]]\n* [[Integrating functionality]]\n* [[ISO 128]]\n* [[ISO 10303]] STEP\n* [[Model based definition]]\n* [[Molecular design software]]\n* [[Open hardware]]\n* [[Rapid prototyping]]\n* [[Responsive computer-aided design]]\n* [[Space mapping]]\n* [[Surrogate model]]\n* [[Virtual prototyping]]\n* [[Virtual reality]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgUSsXdLjvc MIT 1982 CAD lab]\n* {{wikiversity-inline|Computer-aided Geometric Design}}\n* {{wikiversity-inline|Computer-aided design}}\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n{{CAD software}}\n{{Building information modeling}}\n{{Design}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Computer-aided design software| ]]\n[[Category:Computer-aided design| ]]\n[[Category:Design engineering]]\n* Learn Computer Aided Design In Very Easy Way [https://solocaddesigner.com/ Solo Cad Designer ]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Constructing a product by means of computer}}\n{{Redirect-multi|2|CAD|CADD}}\n[[File:Schneckengetriebe.png|thumb|Example: 2D CAD drawing]]\n[[File:Cad crank.jpg|thumb|Example: 3D CAD model]]\n'''Computer-aided design''' ('''CAD''') is the use of [[computer]]s (or {{vanchor|[[workstation]]s|WORKSTATION}}) to aid in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a [[design]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Narayan|first=K.

Depending on the nature of the business, digital or physical prototypes can be initially chosen according to specific needs.\n\nToday, CAD systems exist for all the major platforms ([[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[UNIX]] and [[Mac OS X]]); some packages support multiple platforms.\n\nCurrently, no special hardware is required for most CAD software. However, some CAD systems can do graphically and computationally intensive tasks, so a modern [[graphics card]], high speed (and possibly multiple) [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s and large amounts of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] may be recommended.\n\nThe human-machine interface is generally via a [[computer mouse]] but can also be via a pen and digitizing [[graphics tablet]]. Manipulation of the view of the model on the screen is also sometimes done with the use of a [[3Dconnexion|Spacemouse/SpaceBall]]. Some systems also support stereoscopic glasses for [[Scientific visualization|viewing the 3D model]]. Technologies which in the past were limited to larger installations or specialist applications have become available to a wide group of users. These include the [[Cave automatic virtual environment|CAVE]] or [[Virtual reality|HMDs]] and interactive [[Leap Motion|devices]] like motion-sensing [[Kinect|technology]]\n\n==Software==\nCAD software enables engineers and architects to design, inspect and manage engineering projects within an integrated [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) on a [[personal computer]] system. Most applications support [[solid modeling]] with [[boundary representation]] (B-Rep) and [[NURBS]] geometry, and enable the same to be published in a variety of formats. A [[geometric modeling kernel]] is a software component that provides solid modeling and surface modeling features to CAD applications.\n\nBased on market statistics, [[commercial software]] from Autodesk, Dassault Systems, Siemens PLM Software, and PTC dominate the CAD industry.<ref>[http://caewatch.com/the-big-6-in-cadcaeplm-software-industry-2011/ The Big 6 in CAD/CAE/PLM software industry (2011)], CAEWatch, September 12, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.softwaretop100.org/global-software-top-100-edition-2011|title=GLOBAL SOFTWARE TOP 100 \u2013 EDITION 2011|publisher=Software Top 100|date=2011-08-23|first=Michel|last=van Kooten}}</ref> The following is a list of major CAD applications, grouped by usage statistics.<ref name=\"bm\">[http://www.beyondmech.com/pro-e/cad-topic-33.html List of mechanical CAD softwares], BeyondMech</ref>\n\n{{colbegin|colwidth=}}\n\n===Commercial===\n{{sort list|asc|\n* [[Alibre Design]]\n* [[AllyCAD]]\n* Autodesk [[AutoCAD]]\n* [[Autodesk Inventor]]\n* [[Promine]]\n* [[AxSTREAM]]\n* [[Bentley Systems]] - [[MicroStation]]\n* Bricsys [[BricsCAD]]\n* Dassault Systemes [[CATIA]]\n* Dassault Systemes [[SolidWorks]]\n* Kubotek [[KeyCreator]]\n* [[Siemens NX]]\n* Siemens [[Solid Edge]]\n* PTC [[PTC Creo]] (formerly known as Pro/ENGINEER)\n* [[T-FLEX CAD]]\n* Trimble [[SketchUp]]\n* AgiliCity [[Modelur]]\n* [[TurboCAD]]\n* [[IRONCAD]]\n* [[MEDUSA]]\n* [[ProgeCAD]]\n* [[SpaceClaim]]\n* [[PunchCAD]]\n* [[Rhinoceros 3D]]\n* [[VariCAD]]\n* [[Cobalt (CAD program)|Cobalt]]\n* [[RoutCad]]\n* [[SketchUp]]\n* [[Onshape]]\n* [[Remo 3D]]\n}}\n\n===Freeware and open source===\n* [[123D]]\n* [[BRL-CAD]]\n*[[BricsCAD#BricsCAD_Shape|BricsCAD Shape]]\n* [[FreeCAD]]\n* [[LibreCAD]]\n* [[QCAD]]\n* [[OpenSCAD]]\n* [[SolveSpace]]\n\n===CAD kernels===\n* [[Parasolid]] by Siemens\n* [[ACIS]] by Spatial\n* [[ShapeManager]] by Autodesk\n* [[Open CASCADE]] Open Source\n* [[C3D Toolkit|C3D]] by C3D Labs\n{{colend}}\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[3D computer graphics software]]\n* [[3D printing]]\n* [[Additive Manufacturing File Format]]\n* [[CAD standards]]\n* [[Coarse space (numerical analysis)]]\n* [[Comparison of 3D computer graphics software]]\n* [[Comparison of computer-aided design editors]]\n* [[Comparison of CAD, CAM and CAE file viewers]]\n* [[Comparison of Free EDA software]] (Electronic Design Automation)\n* [[Computer-aided industrial design]]\n* [[Digital architecture]]\n* [[Electronic design automation]]\n* [[Engineering optimization]]\n* [[Finite element method]]\n* [[Integrating functionality]]\n* [[ISO 128]]\n* [[ISO 10303]] STEP\n* [[Model based definition]]\n* [[Molecular design software]]\n* [[Open hardware]]\n* [[Rapid prototyping]]\n* [[Responsive computer-aided design]]\n* [[Space mapping]]\n* [[Surrogate model]]\n* [[Virtual prototyping]]\n* [[Virtual reality]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgUSsXdLjvc MIT 1982 CAD lab]\n* {{wikiversity-inline|Computer-aided Geometric Design}}\n* {{wikiversity-inline|Computer-aided design}}\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n{{CAD software}}\n{{Building information modeling}}\n{{Design}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Computer-aided design software| ]]\n[[Category:Computer-aided design| ]]\n[[Category:Design engineering]]\n", "name_user": "Utpal paul", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design"}

The government mandated the reform of [[Al-Azhar University]] beginning in 1961. These reforms permitted department heads to be drawn from outside the ranks of the traditionally trained orthodox ulama.\n\n==History==\n{{Religion in Egypt}}\nIn the late 10th century, the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] caliphate of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] made Egypt their center and Cairo their capital. Egypt flourished and the Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to [[China]] and its [[Song Dynasty]], which eventually determined the economic course of Egypt during the [[High Middle Ages]]. Many traces of [[Fatimid architecture]] exist in Cairo today, the most defining examples include the [[Al Azhar University]] and the [[Al-Hakim Mosque|Al Hakim mosque]]. The Fatimid palace in Cairo had two parts. It stood in the [[Khan el-Khalili]] area on Bin El-Qasryn street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldroads.org/pastblogs/pastsingles2007/Cairo_of_the_mind.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212005349/http://www.oldroads.org/pastblogs/pastsingles2007/Cairo_of_the_mind.htm |archivedate=12 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, Egyptian Islam was a complex and diverse religion. Although Muslims agreed on the faith's basic tenets, the country's various social groups and classes applied Islam differently in their daily lives. The literate theologians of [[Al-Azhar University]] generally rejected the version of Islam practiced by illiterate religious preachers and peasants in the countryside. Most upper- and upper-middle-class Muslims believed either that religious expression was a private matter for each individual or that Islam should play a more dominant role in public life. Islamic religious revival movements, whose appeal cut across class lines, were present in most cities and in many villages.<ref name=countrystudies>[http://countrystudies.us/egypt/68.htm country studies Egypt Contemporary Islam]</ref>\n\n===Islam and state===\n[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], who assumed power in Egypt in the early 1800s, nationalized all land, including hundreds of thousands of hectares of land belonging to Al Azhar Mosque, putting the funding of that institution under state control.<ref name=Hessler/> This put an end to the political independence of the Ulama.<ref name=Farah>{{cite book|last=Farah|first=Nadia Ramsis|title=Egypt's Political Economy: Power Relations in Development|publisher=American University in Cairo Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrjUP56XGOwC&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=muhammad+ali+independence+of+ulama&source=bl&ots=16ZHPyEM2p&sig=FzsXg1hxtHsMPmgFaKafc3mQ7_0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rk99UvH9G8ewyQHDlYGwDw&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=muhammad%20ali%20independence%20of%20ulama&f=false}}</ref> [[Waqf|Awqaf]], traditionally independent endowments for mosques and Islamic schools, became a ministry of the government.

Most Ulama, including those of [[Al-Azhar University]], are employees of the Egyptian state who \"recognize the regime\u2019s primacy, support its stability, and legitimize its policies\".<ref>[http://www.currenttrends.org/docLib/20061226_UlamaandRadicalismfinal.pdf Establishment Ulama and Radical Islam in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420212045/http://www.currenttrends.org/docLib/20061226_UlamaandRadicalismfinal.pdf |date=20 April 2012 }}</ref> Radical Islamists viewed them as puppets of the status quo. To maintain their influence in the country, the ulama espoused more conservative stances. After 1974, for example, many [[Al-Azhar Mosque|al-Azhar]] ulama, who had acquiesced to family planning initiatives in the 1960s, openly criticized government efforts at population control. The ulama also supported moves to reform the country's legal code to conform to Islamic teaching. They remained, nonetheless, comparatively moderate; they were largely loyal to the government and condemned the violence of radical Islamist groups. Outside of the state-mosques are more than 40,000 independent mosques throughout Egypt.<ref name=\"Osman.p105\"/>\n\n==Beliefs==\n===Contemporary belief===\n\nEgyptian Muslims believe that Islam defines one's relationship to God, to other Muslims, and to non-Muslims. Some devout Muslims believe that there can be no dichotomy between the sacred and the secular. Many Muslims say that Egypt's governments have been secularist and even anti-religious since the early 1920s.<ref name=countrystudies/> Politically organized Muslims who seek to purge the country of its secular policies are referred to as \"[[Islamists]]\".\n\nEgypt's largely uneducated urban and rural lower classes are intensely devoted to Islam, but they usually lack a thorough knowledge of the religion. Even village religious leaders usually have only a rudimentary knowledge of Islam. The typical village imam or prayer leader has at most a few years of schooling; his scholarly work was limited to reading prayers and sermons prepared by others and to learning passages from the [[Qur'an]]. Popular religion include a variety of orthodox practices, such as veneration of saints, recourse to charms and amulets, and belief in the influence of evil spirits.<ref name=countrystudies/>\n[[File:Masjid Hamza in Suez, Egypt.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Masjid [[Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib|Hamza]] in Suez, Egypt]]\n\nPopular Islam is based mostly on oral tradition. Imams with virtually no formal education commonly memorize the entire Qur'an and recite appropriate verses on religious occasions. They also tell religious stories at village festivals and commemorations marking an individual's rites of passage. Predestination plays an important role in popular Islam.<ref name=countrystudies/> This concept includes the belief that everything that happens in life is the will of God and the belief that trying to avoid misfortune is useless and invites worse affliction. Revelations from God in the [[Qur'an]] form the basis of [[Monotheism]] merged with a belief in [[Angels in Islam|angels]], [[jinn]] and [[Ifrit#Egypt|afarit]] (spirits).<ref>el-Sayed El-Aswad Religion and Folk Cosmology: Scenarios of the Visible and Invisible in Rural Egypt Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002 {{ISBN|9780897899246}} p. 103-104</ref>\n\nPopular Islam ranges from informal prayer sessions or Qur'an study to organized cults or orders. Because of the pervasive sexual [[Sex segregation|segregation]] of Egypt's Islamic society, men and women often practice their religion in different ways. A specifically female religious custom is the [[Z\u0101r]], a ceremony for helping women placate spirits who are believed to have possessed them. Women specially trained by their mothers or other women in zar lore organize the ceremonies. A zar organizer holds weekly meetings and employs music and dance to induce ecstatic trances in possessed women. Wealthy women sometimes pay to have private zars conducted in their homes; these zars are more elaborate than public ones, last for several days, and sometimes involve efforts to exorcise spirits.  However, while once common, the zar is rarely practiced today, under fire for its perception as a religious heresy.<ref name=countrystudies/>\n\nThere are more than 45 million citizens 35 years old or younger. The Influence of digital/youth culture is found in preachers such as the very popular [[Amr Khaled]] who \"maintains a disciplined focus on the lives, issues and problems of the upper middle classes\"; espouses \"living a comfortable life\"; talks to youth about \"getting closer to God\" without changing one's lifestyle; promotes [[hijab]] while \"joking about dating and flirting\".<ref name=Osman.p105>Osman, Tarek, ''Egypt on the brink'', 2010, p.105</ref> The young \"sheikhs\" deliver their sermons over the Internet, on private satellite channels and in sports clubs, away from the control of Al-Azhar and the state.<ref name=Osman.p105/>\n\n===Sufism===\nA primarily male spiritual manifestation of Islam is [[Sufism]], an Islamic mystical tradition. It has been called the \"default setting\" of Muslim religious life in Egypt<ref name=Deasy/><ref>\"Sufism has become the \u201cdefault setting\u201d for Muslim life in Egypt, in the words of a recent Carnegie Endowment report\".[http://carnegieendowment.org/files/salafis_sufis.pdf Salafis and Sufis in Egypt]</ref><ref name=brown>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|title=Salafis and Sufis in Egypt|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/files/salafis_sufis.pdf|work=December 2011|publisher=Carnegie Papers|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> although many Sufis are thought to have voted for the Muslim Brotherhood [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]].<ref name=battle/>\n\nSufism exists in a number of forms, most of which represent an original ''[[tariqah|tarika]]'' (\"path\") developed by an inspired founder, or sheikh. These sheikhs gradually gathered about themselves [[murid]]s, or disciples, whom they initiated into the tarika. Gradually the murids formed orders, also known as turuq, which were loyal to the Sheikh or his successors (also called sheikhs). In Egypt there are 74 Sufi orders (tarikas), each headed by its own sheikh. Overseeing them is the Supreme Council for Sufi Orders and the president of Egypt is directly in charge of Sufi affairs.<ref name=ibrahim>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/may/10/islam-sufi-salafi-egypt-religion Salafi intolerance threatens Sufis]| Baher Ibrahim| guardian.co.uk| 10 May 2010</ref>\n\nThe devotions of many Sufi orders center on various forms of the [[dhikr]], a ceremony at which music, body movements, and chants induce a state of ecstatic trance in the disciples. Since the early 1970s, there has been a revival of interest in Sufism. Egypt's contemporary Sufis tend to be young, college-educated men in professional careers.<ref name=countrystudies/>\n\nEstimates of the number of Sufis in Egypt include at least a third of the adult male Muslim population in Egypt, being members of a Sufi order; fifteen million of the country's roughly 80 million citizens \"claim\" Sufism \"as a practice\",<ref name=Deasy>{{cite journal|url=http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/sufis%E2%80%99-choice-egypt%E2%80%99s-political-wild-card|last=Deasy|first=Kristin|title=The Sufis\u2019 Choice: Egypt\u2019s Political Wild Card|journal=World Affairs|date=September\u2013October 2012|accessdate=21 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724235845/http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/sufis%E2%80%99-choice-egypt%E2%80%99s-political-wild-card|archive-date=24 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> still others say that while 15 million are registered as Sufis, \"the true figure is likely to be higher\".<ref name=battle>{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Jess|title=The Battle for Egyptian Islam|url=http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/the-battle-for-egyptian-islam/34/|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=Global Mail|date=7 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423024952/http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/the-battle-for-egyptian-islam/34/|archive-date=23 April 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Participation at the festivals ([[Mawlid|moulids]]) the Sufi orders organize, is perhaps twice that (and includes women and children).<ref name=Bradley.p.85>Bradley, John R., ''Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution'' by John R. Bradley, Palgrave MaacMillan, 2008, p.85</ref> The moulids are a major manifestation of Sufi Islam in Egypt, and are held in honor of holy men and women (In Egypt the term Moulid is not reserved for Muslim festivals and may be in honor of Christian, and until recently Jewish holy men). Sufi Muslim moulids not only venerate the prophet [[Muhammad]] and his descendants (such as [[Hussein]], the second son of the fourth Caliph Ali whose moulid in Cairo can draws crowds of more than a million people), but founders of Sufi orders, down to dozens of lesser-known sheikhs celebrated mostly in remote rural communities. The largest moulid in Egypt takes place in [[Tanta]], which draws an even larger number of pilgrims than [[hajj]] in Mecca. As many as three million Egyptians and other Arabs gather there every October to celebrate the life of Sayid [[Ahmad al-Badawi]], a thirteenth-century Sufi leader.<ref name=Bradley.p.85/> According to the Egyptian Ministry of Awqaf (Islamic charity), there are officially more than forty such annual commemorations, and the Sufi Council in Egypt lists eighty other festivals for lesser-known founders of Sufi orders.<ref name=Bradley.p.85/>\n\nAccording to a report issued by the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], \n<blockquote>Egypt\u2019s Islamic religious establishment is strongly Sufi in character. Adherence to a Sufi order has long been standard for both professors and students in the [[Al-Azhar Mosque|al-Azhar mosque]] and [[Al-Azhar University|university system]].

The current [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar|Shaykh al-Azhar]] (rector of the school), [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]], is a hereditary Sufi shaykh from Upper Egypt who has recently expressed his support for the formation of a world Sufi league; the current Grand Mufti of Egypt and senior al-Azhar scholar [[Ali Gomaa]] is also a highly respected Sufi master.<ref name=brown/></blockquote>\n\n===Salafi===\nAn estimated 5-6 million Egyptians are [[Salafi movement|Salafis]].<ref>[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/78013,news-comment,news-politics,what-is-salafism-and-should-we-be-worried What is Salafism and should we be worried?| First Post]| by Venetia Rainey| LAST UPDATED APRIL 20, 2011</ref> Scholar Tarek Osman describes [[Salafi]]s before the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|2011 revolution]] as the \"most important or pervasive Islamic force in the country\" with an influence \"many times more than that of organized political Islam.\" With \"no history of violence, no organizational structure, no manifestos and no obvious political ambitions\", they were tolerated by the [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] regime and ignored by the news media.<ref name=Osman.p221>''Egypt on the Brink'' by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.221</ref> The Salafi movement benefited from government support the 1990s when the government hoped to \"combat and undermine\" the violence of the Jihadi Salafi [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] with the preaching of the apolitical Salafis.<ref name=battle/> It has also benefited from some of the $70 billion spent by Saudi Arabia to promote \"Wahhabi\" ideology worldwide through mosques, schools and books, that is similar or \"virtually identical to Salafi beliefs and with which Sufis have had difficulty competing.\"<ref name=battle/>\n\nDuring the [[Mubarak era]] most Salafis considered participation in politics to be \"religiously forbidden\", however since then Salafis have shown themselves to be not only tolerant of political participation but very adept.

Several Islamic political groups started soon after [[World War I]] ended. The most well-known Islamic political organization is the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] (Al Ikhwan al Muslimun, also known as the Brotherhood), founded in 1928 by [[Hassan al Banna]]. After [[World War II]], the Muslim Brotherhood acquired a reputation as a radical group prepared to use violence to achieve its religious goals. The group was implicated in several assassinations, including the murder of one prime minister. The Brotherhood had contacts with the Free Officers before the 1952 Revolution and supported most of their initial policies. The Brotherhood, however, soon came into conflict with [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].<ref name=\"georgetown2\">{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220145046/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |archive-date=20 December 2011 |url-status=dead }} See drop-down essay on \"Colonialism and the Rise of Egyptian Nationalism\"</ref> The government accused the Brotherhood of complicity in an alleged 1954 plot to assassinate the president and imprisoned many of the group's leaders. In the 1970s, [[Anwar Sadat]] amnestied the leaders and permitted them to resume some of their activities. But by that time, the Brotherhood was divided into at least three factions. The more militant faction was committed to a policy of political opposition to the government. A second faction advocated peaceful withdrawal from society and the creation, to the extent possible, of a separate, [[parallel society]] based upon Islamic values and law. The dominant moderate group advocated cooperation with the regime.<ref name=Metz>[http://www.higginsctc.org/terrorism/Egypt%20-%20Islamic%20Political%20Movements.htm Islamic Political Movements]. from Helen Chapin Metz, ed. ''Egypt: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990.</ref>\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood's reemergence as a political force coincided with the proliferation of Islamic groups. Some of these groups espoused the violent overthrow of the government while others espoused living a devout life of rigorous observance of religious practices. It is impossible to list all the Islamic groups that emerged in the late 1970s because many of them had diffuse structures and some of the more militant groups were underground. Egypt's defeat and loss of territory in the June 1967 [[Six-Day War]] was the main cause for the growth of religiously inspired political activism.<ref name=\"georgetown3\">{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220145046/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |archive-date=20 December 2011 |url-status=dead }} See drop-down essay on \"Rise of Islamic Activism\"</ref> Muslims tended to view the humiliating experience as the culmination of 150 years of foreign intrusion and an affront to their vision of a true Islamic community. Islamic tradition rejected the idea of non-Muslims dominating Muslim society. Such a state of affairs discredited Muslim rulers who permitted it to persist. It was, therefore, incumbent on believers to end the domination and restore the true supremacy of Islam. As part of their Sunni creed, the most radical activists adopted [[jihad]] and committed themselves to battling unbelievers and impious Muslims. During the 1970s and 1980s, [[Islamist]]s perpetrated a number of violent acts, including the assassination of [[Anwar Sadat]] in October 1981.<ref name=Metz/>\n\nDisruptive social changes and Sadat's relative tolerance toward political parties contributed to the rapid growth of Islamic groups in the 1970s. On university campuses, for example, Sadat initially viewed the rise of Islamic associations ([[Gama'at Islamiya]]) as a counterbalance to leftist influence among students. The Gama'at Islamiya spread quite rapidly on campuses and won up to one-third of all student union elections. These victories provided a platform from which the associations campaigned for Islamic dress, the veiling of women, and the [[Sex segregation|segregation]] of classes by gender. [[Secular]] university administrators opposed these goals. In 1979 Sadat sought to diminish the influence of the associations through a law that transferred most of the authority of the student unions to professors and administrators. During the 1980s, however, Islamists gradually penetrated college faculties. At [[Asyut University]], which was the scene of some of the most intense clashes between Islamists and their opponents (including security forces, secularists, and [[Copts]]), the president and other top administrators\u2014who were Islamists\u2014supported Gama'at Islamiya demands to end mixed-sex classes and to reduce total female enrollment.<ref name=Metz/> Public opinion in Egypt supported political Islam to some extent, one poll in the mid-1980s found 96% of Egyptian Muslims favoring the application of the [[Sharia]].<ref>poll by the \"National Center for SOcial and Criminal Research\" quoted in Robin, Wright, ''Sacred Rage'', p.188-9</ref>\n\n{{As of|1989}}, the Islamists sought to make Egypt a community of the faithful based on their vision of an Islamic social order. They rejected conventional, secularist social analyses of Egypt's socioeconomic problems. They maintained, for example, that the causes of poverty were not overpopulation or high defense expenditures but the populace's spiritual failures\u2014laxness, secularism, and corruption. The solution was a return to the simplicity, hard work, and self-reliance of earlier Muslim life. The Islamists created their own alternative network of social and economic institutions through which members could work, study, and receive medical treatment in an Islamic environment.<ref name=Metz/>\n\nIslamists rejected [[Marxism]] and Western [[capitalism]]. Indeed, they viewed [[atheistic]] [[communism]], [[Jewish]] [[Zionism]], and Western \"Crusader-minded\" Christianity as their main enemies, which were responsible for the decadence that led to foreign domination and defeat by Zionists. They were intolerant of people who did not share their worldview. Islamists tended to be hostile toward the orthodox ulama, especially the scholars at Al Azhar who frequently criticized the Islamists' extreme religious interpretations. Islamists believed that the established social and political order had tainted the ulama, who had come to represent stumbling blocks to the new Islamic order. In addition, Islamists condemned the orthodox as \"pulpit parrots\" committed to a formalist practice of Islam but not to its spirit.<ref name=Metz/>\n\nThe social origins of Islamists changed after the 1952 Revolution. In the 1940s and early 1950s, the Muslim Brotherhood had appealed primarily to urban civil servants and white and blue-collar workers. After the early 1970s, the Islamic revival attracted followers from a broad spectrum of social classes. Most activists were university students or recent graduates; they included rural-urban migrants and urban middle-class youth whose fathers were middle-level government employees or professionals. Their fields of study\u2014medicine, engineering, military science, and pharmacy\u2014were among the most highly competitive and prestigious disciplines in the university system. The rank-and- file members of Islamist groups have come from the middle class, the lower-middle class, and the urban working class.<ref name=Metz/>\n\nVarious Islamist groups espoused different means for achieving their political agenda. All Islamists, however, were concerned with Islam's role in the complex and changing society of Egypt in the late twentieth century. A common focus of their political efforts has been to incorporate the [[Shari'a]] into the country's legal code. In deference to their increasing influence, the Ministry of Justice in 1977 published a draft law making [[apostasy]] by a Muslim a capital offense and proposing traditional Islamic punishments for crimes, such as stoning for adultery and amputation of a hand for theft. In 1980 Egypt supported a referendum that proposed a constitutional amendment to make the Shari'a \"the sole source of law.\" The influence of the Islamists temporarily waned in the aftermath of Sadat's assassination in 1981, but the election of nine members of the Muslim Brotherhood to the People's Assembly in 1984 revived Islamists' prospects. In 1985 the People's Assembly voted to initiate a procedure for the gradual application of the Shari'a, beginning with an indefinite education period to prepare the population for the legal changes; the next step would be to amend all existing laws to exclude any provisions that conflict with the Shari'a. Moves to reform the legal code received support from many Muslims who wanted to purify society and reject Western legal codes forced on Egypt in the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name=Metz/> As of 2009, the [[Grand Mufti]] also has another title, Dar al-Iftaa, a part of the Ministry of Justice.

According to the Constitution, Islam is the official state religion, and [[Shari'a]] is the primary source of legislation; religious practices that conflict with the official interpretation of Shari'a are prohibited. However, since the Government does not consider the practice of Christianity or Judaism to conflict with Shari'a, for the most part members of the non-Muslim minority worship without legal harassment and may maintain links with coreligionists in other countries. Members of other religions that are not recognized by the Government, such as the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], may experience personal and collective hardship.\n\nAn 1856 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] decree still in force requires non-Muslims to obtain a presidential decree to build a place of worship. In addition Interior Ministry regulations issued in 1934 specify a set of 10 conditions that the Government must consider prior to issuance of a presidential decree permitting construction of a church. These conditions include the location of the proposed site, the religious composition of the surrounding community, and the proximity of other churches. The Ottoman decree also requires the President to approve permits for the repair of church facilities.\n\nIn December 1999, in response to strong criticism of the Ottoman decree, [[Hosni Mubarak|President Mubarak]] issued a decree making the repair of all places of worship subject to a 1976 civil construction code. The decree is significant symbolically because it places churches closer to an equal footing with mosques before the law. The practical impact of the decree has been to facilitate significantly church repairs; however, Christians report that local permits still are subject to security authorities' approval. The approval process for church construction continued to be time-consuming and insufficiently responsive to the wishes of the Christian community. As a result of these restrictions, some communities use private buildings and apartments for religious services.\n\nAccording to a 1995 law, the application of family law, including marriage, divorce, alimony, child custody, inheritance, and burial, is based on an individual's religion. In the practice of family law, the State recognizes only the three \"heavenly religions\": Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Muslim families are subject to the Personal Status Law, which draws on [[Shari'a]] (Islamic law). Christian families are subject to canon law, and Jewish families are subject to Jewish law. In cases of family law disputes involving a marriage between a Christian woman and a Muslim man, the courts apply the Personal Status Law.\n\nUnder Islamic law, non-Muslim males must convert to Islam to marry Muslim women. Christian and Jewish women need not convert to marry Muslim men. Muslim women are prohibited from marrying Christian men. Muslim female heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance, while Christian widows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her parents' estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs face strong social pressure to provide for all family members who require assistance; however, this assistance is not always provided. In January 2000, the Parliament passed a new Personal Status Law that made it easier for a Muslim woman to obtain a divorce without her husband's consent, provided that she is willing to forgo alimony and the return of her dowry. However, an earlier provision of the draft law that would have made it easier for a woman to travel without her husband's consent, was rejected.

The government mandated the reform of [[Al-Azhar University]] beginning in 1961. These reforms permitted department heads to be drawn from outside the ranks of the traditionally trained orthodox ulama.\n\n==History==\n{{Religion in Egypt}}\nIn the late 10th century, the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] caliphate of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] made Egypt their center and Cairo their capital. Egypt flourished and the Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to [[China]] and its [[Song Dynasty]], which eventually determined the economic course of Egypt during the [[High Middle Ages]]. Many traces of [[Fatimid architecture]] exist in Cairo today, the most defining examples include the [[Al Azhar University]] and the [[Al-Hakim Mosque|Al Hakim mosque]]. The Fatimid palace in Cairo had two parts. It stood in the [[Khan el-Khalili]] area on Bin El-Qasryn street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldroads.org/pastblogs/pastsingles2007/Cairo_of_the_mind.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212005349/http://www.oldroads.org/pastblogs/pastsingles2007/Cairo_of_the_mind.htm |archivedate=12 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, Egyptian Islam was a complex and diverse religion. Although Muslims agreed on the faith's basic tenets, the country's various social groups and classes applied Islam differently in their daily lives. The literate theologians of [[Al-Azhar University]] generally rejected the version of Islam practiced by illiterate religious preachers and peasants in the countryside. Most upper- and upper-middle-class Muslims believed either that religious expression was a private matter for each individual or that Islam should play a more dominant role in public life. Islamic religious revival movements, whose appeal cut across class lines, were present in most cities and in many villages.<ref name=countrystudies>[http://countrystudies.us/egypt/68.htm country studies Egypt Contemporary Islam]</ref>\n\n===Islam and state===\n[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], who assumed power in Egypt in the early 1800s, nationalized all land, including hundreds of thousands of hectares of land belonging to Al Azhar Mosque, putting the funding of that institution under state control.<ref name=Hessler/> This put an end to the political independence of the Ulama.<ref name=Farah>{{cite book|last=Farah|first=Nadia Ramsis|title=Egypt's Political Economy: Power Relations in Development|publisher=American University in Cairo Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrjUP56XGOwC&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=muhammad+ali+independence+of+ulama&source=bl&ots=16ZHPyEM2p&sig=FzsXg1hxtHsMPmgFaKafc3mQ7_0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rk99UvH9G8ewyQHDlYGwDw&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=muhammad%20ali%20independence%20of%20ulama&f=false}}</ref> [[Waqf|Awqaf]], traditionally independent endowments for mosques and Islamic schools, became a ministry of the government.

Most Ulama, including those of [[Al-Azhar University]], are employees of the Egyptian state who \"recognize the regime\u2019s primacy, support its stability, and legitimize its policies\".<ref>[http://www.currenttrends.org/docLib/20061226_UlamaandRadicalismfinal.pdf Establishment Ulama and Radical Islam in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420212045/http://www.currenttrends.org/docLib/20061226_UlamaandRadicalismfinal.pdf |date=20 April 2012 }}</ref> Radical Islamists viewed them as puppets of the status quo. To maintain their influence in the country, the ulama espoused more conservative stances. After 1974, for example, many [[Al-Azhar Mosque|al-Azhar]] ulama, who had acquiesced to family planning initiatives in the 1960s, openly criticized government efforts at population control. The ulama also supported moves to reform the country's legal code to conform to Islamic teaching. They remained, nonetheless, comparatively moderate; they were largely loyal to the government and condemned the violence of radical Islamist groups. Outside of the state-mosques are more than 40,000 independent mosques throughout Egypt.<ref name=\"Osman.p105\"/>\n\n==Beliefs==\n===Contemporary belief===\n\nEgyptian Muslims believe that Islam defines one's relationship to God, to other Muslims, and to non-Muslims. Some devout Muslims believe that there can be no dichotomy between the sacred and the secular. Many Muslims say that Egypt's governments have been secularist and even anti-religious since the early 1920s.<ref name=countrystudies/> Politically organized Muslims who seek to purge the country of its secular policies are referred to as \"[[Islamists]]\".\n\nEgypt's largely uneducated urban and rural lower classes are intensely devoted to Islam, but they usually lack a thorough knowledge of the religion. Even village religious leaders usually have only a rudimentary knowledge of Islam. The typical village imam or prayer leader has at most a few years of schooling; his scholarly work was limited to reading prayers and sermons prepared by others and to learning passages from the [[Qur'an]]. Popular religion include a variety of orthodox practices, such as veneration of saints, recourse to charms and amulets, and belief in the influence of evil spirits.<ref name=countrystudies/>\n[[File:Masjid Hamza in Suez, Egypt.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Masjid [[Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib|Hamza]] in Suez, Egypt]]\n\nPopular Islam is based mostly on oral tradition. Imams with virtually no formal education commonly memorize the entire Qur'an and recite appropriate verses on religious occasions. They also tell religious stories at village festivals and commemorations marking an individual's rites of passage. Predestination plays an important role in popular Islam.<ref name=countrystudies/> This concept includes the belief that everything that happens in life is the will of God and the belief that trying to avoid misfortune is useless and invites worse affliction. Revelations from God in the [[Qur'an]] form the basis of [[Monotheism]] merged with a belief in [[Angels in Islam|angels]], [[jinn]] and [[Ifrit#Egypt|afarit]] (spirits).<ref>el-Sayed El-Aswad Religion and Folk Cosmology: Scenarios of the Visible and Invisible in Rural Egypt Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002 {{ISBN|9780897899246}} p. 103-104</ref>\n\nPopular Islam ranges from informal prayer sessions or Qur'an study to organized cults or orders. Because of the pervasive sexual [[Sex segregation|segregation]] of Egypt's Islamic society, men and women often practice their religion in different ways. A specifically female religious custom is the [[Z\u0101r]], a ceremony for helping women placate spirits who are believed to have possessed them. Women specially trained by their mothers or other women in zar lore organize the ceremonies. A zar organizer holds weekly meetings and employs music and dance to induce ecstatic trances in possessed women. Wealthy women sometimes pay to have private zars conducted in their homes; these zars are more elaborate than public ones, last for several days, and sometimes involve efforts to exorcise spirits.  However, while once common, the zar is rarely practiced today, under fire for its perception as a religious heresy.<ref name=countrystudies/>\n\nThere are more than 45 million citizens 35 years old or younger. The Influence of digital/youth culture is found in preachers such as the very popular [[Amr Khaled]] who \"maintains a disciplined focus on the lives, issues and problems of the upper middle classes\"; espouses \"living a comfortable life\"; talks to youth about \"getting closer to God\" without changing one's lifestyle; promotes [[hijab]] while \"joking about dating and flirting\".<ref name=Osman.p105>Osman, Tarek, ''Egypt on the brink'', 2010, p.105</ref> The young \"sheikhs\" deliver their sermons over the Internet, on private satellite channels and in sports clubs, away from the control of Al-Azhar and the state.<ref name=Osman.p105/>\n\n===Sufism===\nA primarily male spiritual manifestation of Islam is [[Sufism]], an Islamic mystical tradition. It has been called the \"default setting\" of Muslim religious life in Egypt<ref name=Deasy/><ref>\"Sufism has become the \u201cdefault setting\u201d for Muslim life in Egypt, in the words of a recent Carnegie Endowment report\".[http://carnegieendowment.org/files/salafis_sufis.pdf Salafis and Sufis in Egypt]</ref><ref name=brown>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|title=Salafis and Sufis in Egypt|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/files/salafis_sufis.pdf|work=December 2011|publisher=Carnegie Papers|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref> although many Sufis are thought to have voted for the Muslim Brotherhood [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]].<ref name=battle/>\n\nSufism exists in a number of forms, most of which represent an original ''[[tariqah|tarika]]'' (\"path\") developed by an inspired founder, or sheikh. These sheikhs gradually gathered about themselves [[murid]]s, or disciples, whom they initiated into the tarika. Gradually the murids formed orders, also known as turuq, which were loyal to the Sheikh or his successors (also called sheikhs). In Egypt there are 74 Sufi orders (tarikas), each headed by its own sheikh. Overseeing them is the Supreme Council for Sufi Orders and the president of Egypt is directly in charge of Sufi affairs.<ref name=ibrahim>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/may/10/islam-sufi-salafi-egypt-religion Salafi intolerance threatens Sufis]| Baher Ibrahim| guardian.co.uk| 10 May 2010</ref>\n\nThe devotions of many Sufi orders center on various forms of the [[dhikr]], a ceremony at which music, body movements, and chants induce a state of ecstatic trance in the disciples. Since the early 1970s, there has been a revival of interest in Sufism. Egypt's contemporary Sufis tend to be young, college-educated men in professional careers.<ref name=countrystudies/>\n\nEstimates of the number of Sufis in Egypt include at least a third of the adult male Muslim population in Egypt, being members of a Sufi order; fifteen million of the country's roughly 80 million citizens \"claim\" Sufism \"as a practice\",<ref name=Deasy>{{cite journal|url=http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/sufis%E2%80%99-choice-egypt%E2%80%99s-political-wild-card|last=Deasy|first=Kristin|title=The Sufis\u2019 Choice: Egypt\u2019s Political Wild Card|journal=World Affairs|date=September\u2013October 2012|accessdate=21 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724235845/http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/sufis%E2%80%99-choice-egypt%E2%80%99s-political-wild-card|archive-date=24 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> still others say that while 15 million are registered as Sufis, \"the true figure is likely to be higher\".<ref name=battle>{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Jess|title=The Battle for Egyptian Islam|url=http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/the-battle-for-egyptian-islam/34/|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=Global Mail|date=7 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423024952/http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/the-battle-for-egyptian-islam/34/|archive-date=23 April 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Participation at the festivals ([[Mawlid|moulids]]) the Sufi orders organize, is perhaps twice that (and includes women and children).<ref name=Bradley.p.85>Bradley, John R., ''Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution'' by John R. Bradley, Palgrave MaacMillan, 2008, p.85</ref> The moulids are a major manifestation of Sufi Islam in Egypt, and are held in honor of holy men and women (In Egypt the term Moulid is not reserved for Muslim festivals and may be in honor of Christian, and until recently Jewish holy men). Sufi Muslim moulids not only venerate the prophet [[Muhammad]] and his descendants (such as [[Hussein]], the second son of the fourth Caliph Ali whose moulid in Cairo can draws crowds of more than a million people), but founders of Sufi orders, down to dozens of lesser-known sheikhs celebrated mostly in remote rural communities. The largest moulid in Egypt takes place in [[Tanta]], which draws an even larger number of pilgrims than [[hajj]] in Mecca. As many as three million Egyptians and other Arabs gather there every October to celebrate the life of Sayid [[Ahmad al-Badawi]], a thirteenth-century Sufi leader.<ref name=Bradley.p.85/> According to the Egyptian Ministry of Awqaf (Islamic charity), there are officially more than forty such annual commemorations, and the Sufi Council in Egypt lists eighty other festivals for lesser-known founders of Sufi orders.<ref name=Bradley.p.85/>\n\nAccording to a report issued by the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], \n<blockquote>Egypt\u2019s Islamic religious establishment is strongly Sufi in character. Adherence to a Sufi order has long been standard for both professors and students in the [[Al-Azhar Mosque|al-Azhar mosque]] and [[Al-Azhar University|university system]]. Although al-Azhar is not monolithic, its identity has been strongly associated with Sufism. The current [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar|Shaykh al-Azhar]] (rector of the school), [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]], is a hereditary Sufi shaykh from Upper Egypt who has recently expressed his support for the formation of a world Sufi league; the current Grand Mufti of Egypt and senior al-Azhar scholar [[Ali Gomaa]] is also a highly respected Sufi master.<ref name=brown/></blockquote>\n\n===Salafi===\nAn estimated 5-6 million Egyptians are [[Salafi movement|Salafis]].<ref>[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/78013,news-comment,news-politics,what-is-salafism-and-should-we-be-worried What is Salafism and should we be worried?| First Post]| by Venetia Rainey| LAST UPDATED APRIL 20, 2011</ref> Scholar Tarek Osman describes [[Salafi]]s before the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|2011 revolution]] as the \"most important or pervasive Islamic force in the country\" with an influence \"many times more than that of organized political Islam.\" With \"no history of violence, no organizational structure, no manifestos and no obvious political ambitions\", they were tolerated by the [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] regime and ignored by the news media.<ref name=Osman.p221>''Egypt on the Brink'' by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.221</ref> The Salafi movement benefited from government support the 1990s when the government hoped to \"combat and undermine\" the violence of the Jihadi Salafi [[al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]] with the preaching of the apolitical Salafis.<ref name=battle/> It has also benefited from some of the $70 billion spent by Saudi Arabia to promote \"Wahhabi\" ideology worldwide through mosques, schools and books, that is similar or \"virtually identical to Salafi beliefs and with which Sufis have had difficulty competing.\"<ref name=battle/>\n\nDuring the [[Mubarak era]] most Salafis considered participation in politics to be \"religiously forbidden\", however since then Salafis have shown themselves to be not only tolerant of political participation but very adept.

Several Islamic political groups started soon after [[World War I]] ended. The most well-known Islamic political organization is the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] (Al Ikhwan al Muslimun, also known as the Brotherhood), founded in 1928 by [[Hassan al Banna]]. After [[World War II]], the Muslim Brotherhood acquired a reputation as a radical group prepared to use violence to achieve its religious goals. The group was implicated in several assassinations, including the murder of one prime minister. The Brotherhood had contacts with the Free Officers before the 1952 Revolution and supported most of their initial policies. The Brotherhood, however, soon came into conflict with [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].<ref name=\"georgetown2\">{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220145046/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |archive-date=20 December 2011 |url-status=dead }} See drop-down essay on \"Colonialism and the Rise of Egyptian Nationalism\"</ref> The government accused the Brotherhood of complicity in an alleged 1954 plot to assassinate the president and imprisoned many of the group's leaders. In the 1970s, [[Anwar Sadat]] amnestied the leaders and permitted them to resume some of their activities. But by that time, the Brotherhood was divided into at least three factions. The more militant faction was committed to a policy of political opposition to the government. A second faction advocated peaceful withdrawal from society and the creation, to the extent possible, of a separate, [[parallel society]] based upon Islamic values and law. The dominant moderate group advocated cooperation with the regime.<ref name=Metz>[http://www.higginsctc.org/terrorism/Egypt%20-%20Islamic%20Political%20Movements.htm Islamic Political Movements]. from Helen Chapin Metz, ed. ''Egypt: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1990.</ref>\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood's reemergence as a political force coincided with the proliferation of Islamic groups. Some of these groups espoused the violent overthrow of the government while others espoused living a devout life of rigorous observance of religious practices. It is impossible to list all the Islamic groups that emerged in the late 1970s because many of them had diffuse structures and some of the more militant groups were underground. Egypt's defeat and loss of territory in the June 1967 [[Six-Day War]] was the main cause for the growth of religiously inspired political activism.<ref name=\"georgetown3\">{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220145046/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |archive-date=20 December 2011 |url-status=dead }} See drop-down essay on \"Rise of Islamic Activism\"</ref> Muslims tended to view the humiliating experience as the culmination of 150 years of foreign intrusion and an affront to their vision of a true Islamic community. Islamic tradition rejected the idea of non-Muslims dominating Muslim society. Such a state of affairs discredited Muslim rulers who permitted it to persist. It was, therefore, incumbent on believers to end the domination and restore the true supremacy of Islam. As part of their Sunni creed, the most radical activists adopted [[jihad]] and committed themselves to battling unbelievers and impious Muslims. During the 1970s and 1980s, [[Islamist]]s perpetrated a number of violent acts, including the assassination of [[Anwar Sadat]] in October 1981.<ref name=Metz/>\n\nDisruptive social changes and Sadat's relative tolerance toward political parties contributed to the rapid growth of Islamic groups in the 1970s. On university campuses, for example, Sadat initially viewed the rise of Islamic associations ([[Gama'at Islamiya]]) as a counterbalance to leftist influence among students. The Gama'at Islamiya spread quite rapidly on campuses and won up to one-third of all student union elections. These victories provided a platform from which the associations campaigned for Islamic dress, the veiling of women, and the [[Sex segregation|segregation]] of classes by gender. [[Secular]] university administrators opposed these goals. In 1979 Sadat sought to diminish the influence of the associations through a law that transferred most of the authority of the student unions to professors and administrators. During the 1980s, however, Islamists gradually penetrated college faculties. At [[Asyut University]], which was the scene of some of the most intense clashes between Islamists and their opponents (including security forces, secularists, and [[Copts]]), the president and other top administrators\u2014who were Islamists\u2014supported Gama'at Islamiya demands to end mixed-sex classes and to reduce total female enrollment.<ref name=Metz/> Public opinion in Egypt supported political Islam to some extent, one poll in the mid-1980s found 96% of Egyptian Muslims favoring the application of the [[Sharia]].<ref>poll by the \"National Center for SOcial and Criminal Research\" quoted in Robin, Wright, ''Sacred Rage'', p.188-9</ref>\n\n{{As of|1989}}, the Islamists sought to make Egypt a community of the faithful based on their vision of an Islamic social order. They rejected conventional, secularist social analyses of Egypt's socioeconomic problems. They maintained, for example, that the causes of poverty were not overpopulation or high defense expenditures but the populace's spiritual failures\u2014laxness, secularism, and corruption. The solution was a return to the simplicity, hard work, and self-reliance of earlier Muslim life. The Islamists created their own alternative network of social and economic institutions through which members could work, study, and receive medical treatment in an Islamic environment.<ref name=Metz/>\n\nIslamists rejected [[Marxism]] and Western [[capitalism]]. Indeed, they viewed [[atheistic]] [[communism]], [[Jewish]] [[Zionism]], and Western \"Crusader-minded\" Christianity as their main enemies, which were responsible for the decadence that led to foreign domination and defeat by Zionists. They were intolerant of people who did not share their worldview. Islamists tended to be hostile toward the orthodox ulama, especially the scholars at Al Azhar who frequently criticized the Islamists' extreme religious interpretations. Islamists believed that the established social and political order had tainted the ulama, who had come to represent stumbling blocks to the new Islamic order. In addition, Islamists condemned the orthodox as \"pulpit parrots\" committed to a formalist practice of Islam but not to its spirit.<ref name=Metz/>\n\nThe social origins of Islamists changed after the 1952 Revolution. In the 1940s and early 1950s, the Muslim Brotherhood had appealed primarily to urban civil servants and white and blue-collar workers. After the early 1970s, the Islamic revival attracted followers from a broad spectrum of social classes. Most activists were university students or recent graduates; they included rural-urban migrants and urban middle-class youth whose fathers were middle-level government employees or professionals. Their fields of study\u2014medicine, engineering, military science, and pharmacy\u2014were among the most highly competitive and prestigious disciplines in the university system. The rank-and- file members of Islamist groups have come from the middle class, the lower-middle class, and the urban working class.<ref name=Metz/>\n\nVarious Islamist groups espoused different means for achieving their political agenda. All Islamists, however, were concerned with Islam's role in the complex and changing society of Egypt in the late twentieth century. A common focus of their political efforts has been to incorporate the [[Shari'a]] into the country's legal code. In deference to their increasing influence, the Ministry of Justice in 1977 published a draft law making [[apostasy]] by a Muslim a capital offense and proposing traditional Islamic punishments for crimes, such as stoning for adultery and amputation of a hand for theft. In 1980 Egypt supported a referendum that proposed a constitutional amendment to make the Shari'a \"the sole source of law.\" The influence of the Islamists temporarily waned in the aftermath of Sadat's assassination in 1981, but the election of nine members of the Muslim Brotherhood to the People's Assembly in 1984 revived Islamists' prospects. In 1985 the People's Assembly voted to initiate a procedure for the gradual application of the Shari'a, beginning with an indefinite education period to prepare the population for the legal changes; the next step would be to amend all existing laws to exclude any provisions that conflict with the Shari'a. Moves to reform the legal code received support from many Muslims who wanted to purify society and reject Western legal codes forced on Egypt in the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name=Metz/> As of 2009, the [[Grand Mufti]] also has another title, Dar al-Iftaa, a part of the Ministry of Justice. While his rulings are nonbinding, they are \"influential.\" His office issues 5,000 [[fatwa]]s a week.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/22/AR2009102203800.html |title=The Grand Mufti's mission |accessdate= |author=Michael Gerson |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2009-10-23 |work= |publisher=Washington Post |pages=27A |quote= }}</ref><!---probably was before 2009, but don't have start date nor cite--->\n\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, only the Gama'at Islamiya leaders who were in prison after the assassination of Sadat were released after several books they wrote and interviews showed that they revised their points of view and changed the radical tone of their speeches.<ref name=Metz/>\n\n==Status of religious freedom==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}\n{{main|Religion in Egypt}}\n\n[[File:Cairo mosques.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Historical and ancient mosques in [[Cairo]].]]\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of belief and the practice of religion; however, the Government places restrictions on this right. According to the Constitution, Islam is the official state religion, and [[Shari'a]] is the primary source of legislation; religious practices that conflict with the official interpretation of Shari'a are prohibited. However, since the Government does not consider the practice of Christianity or Judaism to conflict with Shari'a, for the most part members of the non-Muslim minority worship without legal harassment and may maintain links with coreligionists in other countries. Members of other religions that are not recognized by the Government, such as the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], may experience personal and collective hardship.\n\nAn 1856 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] decree still in force requires non-Muslims to obtain a presidential decree to build a place of worship. In addition Interior Ministry regulations issued in 1934 specify a set of 10 conditions that the Government must consider prior to issuance of a presidential decree permitting construction of a church. These conditions include the location of the proposed site, the religious composition of the surrounding community, and the proximity of other churches. The Ottoman decree also requires the President to approve permits for the repair of church facilities.\n\nIn December 1999, in response to strong criticism of the Ottoman decree, [[Hosni Mubarak|President Mubarak]] issued a decree making the repair of all places of worship subject to a 1976 civil construction code. The decree is significant symbolically because it places churches closer to an equal footing with mosques before the law. The practical impact of the decree has been to facilitate significantly church repairs; however, Christians report that local permits still are subject to security authorities' approval. The approval process for church construction continued to be time-consuming and insufficiently responsive to the wishes of the Christian community. As a result of these restrictions, some communities use private buildings and apartments for religious services.\n\nAccording to a 1995 law, the application of family law, including marriage, divorce, alimony, child custody, inheritance, and burial, is based on an individual's religion. In the practice of family law, the State recognizes only the three \"heavenly religions\": Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Muslim families are subject to the Personal Status Law, which draws on [[Shari'a]] (Islamic law). Christian families are subject to canon law, and Jewish families are subject to Jewish law. In cases of family law disputes involving a marriage between a Christian woman and a Muslim man, the courts apply the Personal Status Law.\n\nUnder Islamic law, non-Muslim males must convert to Islam to marry Muslim women. Christian and Jewish women need not convert to marry Muslim men. Muslim women are prohibited from marrying Christian men. Muslim female heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance, while Christian widows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her parents' estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs face strong social pressure to provide for all family members who require assistance; however, this assistance is not always provided. In January 2000, the Parliament passed a new Personal Status Law that made it easier for a Muslim woman to obtain a divorce without her husband's consent, provided that she is willing to forgo alimony and the return of her dowry. However, an earlier provision of the draft law that would have made it easier for a woman to travel without her husband's consent, was rejected. Although later in 2000, after a court ruling, Egyptian women were given the right to apply for a passport and travel without the husband's consent.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Islam by country]]\n* [[Religion in Egypt]]\n* [[Christianity in Egypt]]\n\n==References==\n\nFURTHER READING:\n* \"SUFISM\" by R.M.
