In 1945 and 1946, the city received a share of the national reconstruction budget roughly proportional to its amount of bombing damage (26.6%), but in successive years Tokyo saw its share dwindle. By 1949, Tokyo was given only 10.9% of the budget; at the same time there was runaway inflation devaluing the money. [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation authorities]] such as [[Joseph Dodge]] stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.<ref>Andre Sorensen.

Both bombers were attacked by several Japanese fighters of both the [[302nd Naval Air Group]] at [[Atsugi]] and the [[Yokosuka]] Air Group that made 10 gunnery passes. Japanese [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|IJNAS]] [[Flying ace|ace]]s [[Sadamu Komachi]] and [[Sabur\u014d Sakai]] were part of this attack. The B-32 piloted by 1st Lt. John R. Anderson, was hit at 20,000 feet; cannon fire knocked out the number two (port inner) engine, and three crew were injured, including Sgt. Anthony J. Marchione, 19, of the [[20th Intelligence Squadron|20th Reconnaissance Squadron]], who took a 20&nbsp;mm hit to the chest and died 30 minutes later. Tail gunner Sgt. John Houston destroyed one attacker. The lead bomber, [[Consolidated B-32-20-CF Dominator]], ''42-108532'', \"Hobo Queen II\", piloted by 1st Lt. James Klein, was not seriously damaged but the second [[Consolidated B-32-35-CF Dominator]], ''42-108578'', lost an engine, had the upper turret knocked out of action, and partially lost rudder control. Both bombers landed at Yontan Airfield just past ~1800 hrs. having survived the last air combat of the Pacific war. The following day, propellers were removed from Japanese aircraft as part of the surrender agreement. Marchione was buried on Okinawa on 19 August, his body being returned to his [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania]] home on 18 March 1949.

Unlike the Italian Norcia, which is pronounced \"nor-cha\", New Norcia is pronounced \"new nor-sia\".\n\n=== Town ===\n[[File:New Norcia Hotel Tavern.jpg|thumb|right|New Norcia Hotel]]\nThe town of New Norcia has buildings in a Spanish style of architecture, along with some other historical sites. Among these are the two old [[boarding school]]s, St Ildephonsus' and St Gertrude's (both now used for accommodation and various social functions), the Abbey Church (containing the tomb of Rosendo Salvado), an old mill, a wine press, a hotel and the monastery itself.\n\nThe town has attracted interest and tourist visits for most of its existence, and as a consequence a number of guide books and histories have been produced.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Smith, John H | author2=Benedictine Abbey of New Norcia, Western Australia | title=The story of New Norcia : the Western Australian Benedictine mission | date=2008 | publisher=Benedictine Community of New Norcia | edition=8th | isbn=978-0-646-49721-1 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author1=Monachus | author2=Benedictine Abbey of New Norcia, Western Australia | title=New Norcia : historical guide to all its institutions | date=1946 | publisher=Benedictine Abbey | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11316040 | accessdate=6 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\nTours of the town are operated daily by the Friends of New Norcia, who also organise the accommodation in the various buildings including the monastery retreat.<ref>[http://www.newnorcia.wa.edu.au/friends.htm Friends of New Norcia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n \nThe [[Benedictines|Benedictine monks]] continue to occupy the monastery and are involved with most of the enterprises in the town.

On 1 March 1847, Salvado and Joseph Serra laid the foundation stone for a permanent mission building. It was a year to the day since Benedictine monks set up their first camp in the Victoria Plains. After three years spent among the local Aboriginal people, Salvado came to the conclusion that they could be converted to Christianity. Salvado was appointed the first abbot of New Norcia on 12 March 1867. Following his death on 29 December 1900, Father [[Fulgentius Torres]] OSB was elected abbot in 1902.\n\nToday's monastery is centred upon the site of the original mission building, which Salvado and Serra completed in April 1847 with the assistance of a group of volunteers from Perth. Additional wings were added in the second half of the 19th century, and under New Norcia's second Abbot, Fulgentius Torres, a properly appointed monastery was established.\n\nBehind the monastery's wrought-iron gates, imported by Torres from England early in the 20th century, stands a statue of [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]], who founded the Benedictine Order. \n\nThere are 11 monks living in the monastery, ranging in age from 40 to 95.  They pray together seven times a day.\n\n=== Abbots ===\nSource:<ref>[http://www.ozburials.com/CemsWA/Victoria%20Plains/newnorcia.htm New Norcia Cemetery]</ref>\n* [[Rosendo Salvado]], 12 March 1867 \u2013 29 December 1900, died as abbot, aged 86 years\n* [[Fulgentius Torres]], 1902 \u2013 6 October 1914, died as abbot, aged 53 years<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article92563322 |title=OBITUARY. |newspaper=[[Kalgoorlie Miner]] |location=WA |date=6 October 1914 |accessdate=28 November 2014 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n* Anselm Catalan, 1915\u20131951 (retired),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146749708 |title=LORD ABBOT OF NEW NORCIA TO RETIRE. |newspaper=[[The Catholic Weekly]] |location=Sydney |date=28 June 1951 |accessdate=28 November 2014 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> died 29 July 1959, aged 80 years\n* Gregory Gomez,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146745582 |title=NEW LORD ABBOT ELECTED. |newspaper=[[The Catholic Weekly]] |location=Sydney |date=9 August 1951 |accessdate=28 November 2014 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> 1951\u20131971 (resigned), died 31 May 1995, aged 91 years\n* Bernard Rooney, 31 March 1974 \u2013 15 June 1980 (resigned)\n* Placid Spearritt, 29 January 1997 \u2013 4 October 2008, died as abbot, aged 75 years<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/3236344/Abbot-Placid-Spearritt.html Obituary of Abbot Placid Spearritt]</ref>\n* John Herbert, 23 January 2009 to present\n\nFrom 1983 until 1997, the Territorial Abbey had been suppressed into the Archdiocese of Perth and Spearritt worked as an administrator.\n\n===Abbey buildings and pipe organs ===\nThe abbey buildings are on the eastern side of the current highway alignment through the town.\n\nThere are two pipe organs located within the abbey buildings.

On 1 March 1847, Salvado and Joseph Serra laid the foundation stone for a permanent mission building. It was a year to the day since Benedictine monks set up their first camp in the Victoria Plains. After three years spent among the local Aboriginal people, Salvado came to the conclusion that they could be converted to Christianity. Salvado was appointed the first abbot of New Norcia on 12 March 1867. Following his death on 29 December 1900, Father [[Fulgentius Torres]] OSB was elected abbot in 1902.\n\nToday's monastery is centred upon the site of the original mission building, which Salvado and Serra completed in April 1847 with the assistance of a group of volunteers from Perth. Additional wings were added in the second half of the 19th century, and under New Norcia's second Abbot, Fulgentius Torres, a properly appointed monastery was established.\n\nBehind the monastery's wrought-iron gates, imported by Torres from England early in the 20th century, stands a statue of [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]], who founded the Benedictine Order. \n\nThere are 11 monks living in the monastery, ranging in age from 40 to 95.  They pray together seven times a day.\n\n=== Abbots ===\nSource:<ref>[http://www.ozburials.com/CemsWA/Victoria%20Plains/newnorcia.htm New Norcia Cemetery]</ref>\n* [[Rosendo Salvado]], 12 March 1867 \u2013 29 December 1900, died as abbot, aged 86 years\n* [[Fulgentius Torres]], 1902 \u2013 6 October 1914, died as abbot, aged 53 years<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article92563322 |title=OBITUARY. |newspaper=[[Kalgoorlie Miner]] |location=WA |date=6 October 1914 |accessdate=28 November 2014 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n* Anselm Catalan, 1915\u20131951 (retired),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146749708 |title=LORD ABBOT OF NEW NORCIA TO RETIRE. |newspaper=[[The Catholic Weekly]] |location=Sydney |date=28 June 1951 |accessdate=28 November 2014 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> died 29 July 1959, aged 80 years\n* Gregory Gomez,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146745582 |title=NEW LORD ABBOT ELECTED. |newspaper=[[The Catholic Weekly]] |location=Sydney |date=9 August 1951 |accessdate=28 November 2014 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> 1951\u20131971 (resigned), died 31 May 1995, aged 91 years\n* Bernard Rooney, 31 March 1974 \u2013 15 June 1980 (resigned)\n* Placid Spearritt, 29 January 1997 \u2013 4 October 2008, died as abbot, aged 75 years<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/3236344/Abbot-Placid-Spearritt.html Obituary of Abbot Placid Spearritt]</ref>\n* John Herbert, 23 January 2009 to present\n\nFrom 1983 until 1997, the Territorial Abbey had been suppressed into the Archdiocese of Perth and Spearritt worked as an administrator.\n\n===Abbey buildings and pipe organs ===\nThe abbey buildings are on the eastern side of the current highway alignment through the town.\n\nThere are two pipe organs located within the abbey buildings.

In the triennial reports of 1642 he says of himself that he was not physically strong, that he had studied religion, arts, and theology, that he had taught grammar one year, arts four, theology nineteen, and had been professed. According to [[Nathaniel Bacon (Jesuit)|Southwell]], he taught philosophy at Monforte,<ref>There are several places in Spain called [[Monforte (disambiguation)|Monforte]]. The most likely candidate would seem to be [[Monforte de Lemos]], home of the [[College of Nosa Se\u00f1ora da Antiga]].</ref> theology at [[Salamanca]], and was called from there to the [[Imperial College of Madrid]], where, by royal decree, he taught moral theology.\n\nLater he was named censor to the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and confessor of [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n, Count-Duke of Olivares]], the favorite of [[Philip IV of Spain]], whom he followed when he was exiled from Madrid. Southwell describes his character by saying that he was a good religious, noted for his innocence. Mentally he qualifies him as subtle in argument, sound in opinion, keen-edged and clear in expression, and well-versed in [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]].
