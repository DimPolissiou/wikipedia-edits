He established himself as a key member of the team that won the Premier League in [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League|2006\u201307]], their first title success in four years. The following season he was part of the side that won the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|2008 Champions League final]], playing the full 120 minutes as they enjoyed a 6\u20135 penalty shootout win, with Carrick converting his spot kick, to help achieve the [[Double (association football)#European Doubles|European Double]].

He was sent on loan twice during his debut season, to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], before securing a place in the first team by the 2000\u201301 season. He experienced relegation in the 2002\u201303 season and was voted into the PFA First Division Team of the Year in the following campaign. He made more than 150 appearances for ''the Hammers'', and in 2004, he moved to rival London club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a fee believed to be [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]3.5&nbsp;million. He played an influential role at the club for two seasons before moving to Manchester United in 2006 for \u00a318&nbsp;million.\n\nFrom his debut onwards, Carrick was a regular in the Manchester United first team, making more than 50 appearances in his first season with them. He established himself as a key member of the team that won the Premier League in [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League|2006\u201307]], their first title success in four years. The following season he was part of the side that won the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|2008 Champions League final]], playing the full 120 minutes as they enjoyed a 6\u20135 penalty shootout win, with Carrick converting his spot kick, to help achieve the [[Double (association football)#European Doubles|European Double]].

A [[European Arrest Warrant]] for all of them was issued but was later retracted. The stated reason for the retraction was the worry that those who had fled to Belgium would have had to be treated differently from those who stayed. Indeed, the charge of [[sedition]] underlying the arrest warrant does not exist in [[Law of Belgium|Belgian law]], and there was speculation that the Belgian courts would only consider extraditing the Catalan politicians after requalifying the charges.

It was first planned as a commercial freighter in 1967, as a replacement for the [[Antonov An-12]]. It was designed to deliver heavy machinery to remote, poorly served areas. Military versions of the Il-76 have been widely used in Europe, Asia and Africa, including use as an [[aerial refueling]] tanker or command center.\n\nThe Il-76 has seen extensive service as a commercial freighter for ramp-delivered cargo, especially for outsized or heavy items unable to be otherwise carried. It has also been used as an emergency response transport for civilian evacuations as well as for humanitarian aid and disaster relief around the world. Because of its ability to operate from unpaved runways, it has been useful in undeveloped areas. Specialized models have also been produced for aerial firefighting and zero-G training.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Volga-Dnepr IL-76 RA-76950 (8222957212) (2).jpg|thumb|The Il-76 is a [[high-wing]] freighter with [[Four-engined jet aircraft|four turbofans]] and a [[T-tail]]]]\n\n===Origins===\nThe aircraft was first conceived by [[Ilyushin]] in 1967 to meet a requirement for a freighter able to carry a payload of 40 tons (88,000&nbsp;lb) over a range of 5,000&nbsp;km (2,700 [[nautical mile|nmi]]; 3,100 [[statute mile|mi]]) in less than six hours, able to operate from short and unprepared airstrips, and capable of coping with the worst weather conditions likely to be experienced in Siberia and the Soviet Union's Arctic regions.

The Il-76 carried 89% of Soviet troops and 74% of the freight that was airlifted. As Afghan rebels were unable to shoot down high-flying Il-76s, their tactics were to try and damage it on takeoff or landing. Il-76s were often hit by shoulder-launched [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]] and [[9K34 Strela-3|Strela]] heat-seeking missiles and large-calibre machine gun fire, but because the strong airframes were able to take substantial damage and still remain operational, the aircraft had a remarkably low [[attrition rate]] during this period of conflict.

It was first planned as a commercial freighter in 1967, as a replacement for the [[Antonov An-12]]. It was designed to deliver heavy machinery to remote, poorly served areas. Military versions of the Il-76 have been widely used in Europe, Asia and Africa, including use as an [[aerial refueling]] tanker or command center.\n\nThe Il-76 has seen extensive service as a commercial freighter for ramp-delivered cargo, especially for outsized or heavy items unable to be otherwise carried. It has also been used as an emergency response transport for civilian evacuations as well as for humanitarian aid and disaster relief around the world. Because of its ability to operate from unpaved runways, it has been useful in undeveloped areas. Specialized models have also been produced for aerial firefighting and zero-G training.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Volga-Dnepr IL-76 RA-76950 (8222957212) (2).jpg|thumb|The Il-76 is a [[high-wing]] freighter with [[Four-engined jet aircraft|four turbofans]] and a [[T-tail]]]]\n\n===Origins===\nThe aircraft was first conceived by [[Ilyushin]] in 1967 to meet a requirement for a freighter able to carry a payload of 40 tons (88,000&nbsp;lb) over a range of 5,000&nbsp;km (2,700 [[nautical mile|nmi]]; 3,100 [[statute mile|mi]]) in less than six hours, able to operate from short and unprepared airstrips, and capable of coping with the worst weather conditions likely to be experienced in Siberia and the Soviet Union's Arctic regions. It was intended to replace the [[Antonov An-12]]. Another intended version was a double-decked 250-passenger airliner but that project was cancelled.

The Il-76 carried 89% of Soviet troops and 74% of the freight that was airlifted. As Afghan rebels were unable to shoot down high-flying Il-76s, their tactics were to try and damage it on takeoff or landing. Il-76s were often hit by shoulder-launched [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]] and [[9K34 Strela-3|Strela]] heat-seeking missiles and large-calibre machine gun fire, but because the strong airframes were able to take substantial damage and still remain operational, the aircraft had a remarkably low [[attrition rate]] during this period of conflict. Building on that experience, the bulk of the Canadian Forces equipment into Afghanistan was flown in using civilian Il-76s.<ref>[http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteePublication.aspx?SourceId=187014 Canadian Parliament Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013150828/http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteePublication.aspx?SourceId=187014 |date=October 13, 2007}}</ref> In 2006, the Russian Air Force had about 200 Il-76s.
