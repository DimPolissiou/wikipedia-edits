It was designed to replace the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] chambered [[Heckler & Koch G3]] and the G3 based [[.223 Remington|.223 Remington/5.56\u00d745mm]] and later 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambered [[Heckler & Koch HK33]] service rifles providing a more modern weapon compatible with than recently introduced [[NATO]] standards.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\">Wo\u017aniak, Ryszard.

The two-piece bolt mechanism consists of a bolt head that contains two cylindrical locking rollers and a wedge-shaped locking piece, attached to a heavy bolt head carrier. Based on the geometric relationship arising from the angles of the roller contact surfaces of the wedge-shaped locking piece locking piece and the barrel extension recesses, the rearward motion of the bolt head is delayed by a predetermined ratio. Thus during the same period of time, the bolt head carrier moves significantly faster than the bolt head by the predetermined ratio. This ratio is continued until the locking rollers have been withdrawn from the barrel extension recesses. After the rollers retract entirely behind the bolt head, the locking recesses of the barrel extension are cleared, and all parts continue moving rearward together, opening the breech and actuating the extraction and feeding cycles. The chamber is opened under high pressure, thus the chamber received a series of flutes in order to increase extraction reliability and prevent sticking of the spent casing to the chamber walls.\n\nLike the G3 and G33 bolts the HK41 bolt features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface. The \"bolt head locking lever\" is a spring-loaded claw mounted on the bolt carrier that grabs the bolt head as the bolt carrier group goes into battery. The lever essentially ratchets into place with friction, providing enough resistance to being re-opened that the bolt carrier does not rebound. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside the bolt while the lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by the recoiling bolt).\n\n===Features===\nThe G41 [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] is [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] from a smooth {{convert|1.0|mm|abbr=on|2}} [[Sheet metal|sheet]] of high-tensile [[steel]] rather than the {{convert|1.2|mm|abbr=on|2}} thick sheet steel used by the HK33.\n\nThe HK41 also had a redesigned bolt assembly. It was designed around 5.56\u00d745mm NATO ammunition with revised geometries between the bolt mechanism components to work with NATO STANAG magazines. It could also use older .223 Remington/5.56\u00d745mm M193 ammunition.\nThe reliable functioning of roller-delayed blowback mechanisms is limited by specific ammunition and arm parameters like bullet weight, propellant charge, barrel length and amount of wear. For obtaining a proper and safe functioning parameters bandwith arms Heckler & Koch offer a variety of locking pieces with different mass and shoulder angles. The angles are critical and determine the unlock timing and pressure curve progression as the locking pieces act in unison with the bolt head carrier.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd8FrUe8fMM How Does It Work: Roller Delayed Blowback]</ref><ref>[http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2010/08/actions-blowback-action-roller-delayed.html Actions: Blowback Action: Roller Delayed Blowback ]</ref><ref>[https://www.internationalsportsman.com/how-roller-delayed-firearms-work-and-why-it-matters/ How Roller-Delayed Firearms Work and Why it Matters]</ref>\nThe HK41 bolt assembly is lighter than the G33 bolt assembly. The redesigned bolt was paired with a new recoil spring which consisted of five wound strands around a central coil. This reduced recoil.\n\nThe revised buttstock on the G41 is held in place by two pins. Unlike the earlier HK33, the G41\u2019s pistol grip assembly is not retained by a pin at the front of the assembly behind the magazine well housing and can be removed by the user during a field strip.\n\nThe spent cartridge casing extractor is installed inside the bolt head, while the tilting lever ejector is contained in the trigger housing. The rifle is hammer-fired and has a trigger group with a fire control selector that enables selecting safe, semi-automatic, burst and continuous fire modes. The fire selector's positions are marked with bullet [[pictogram]]s and it also serves as a manual safety against unintentional discharge. The selector is ambidextrous and its lever is mirrored on both sides of the trigger housing. In the \"safe\" position, the trigger and sear are disabled.\n\nThe G41 uses NATO [[STANAG magazine]]s (from the [[M16 rifle]]) with a capacity of 30 rounds. The magazine release is located on the left side of the rifle, above the magazine well.\n\nThe weapon incorporates a manual [[forward assist]] that can be used to positively close the bolt, similar to the one used on the American [[M16_rifle#XM16E1_and_M16A1_(Colt_Model_603)|M16A1]] rifle, and a side-folding heavy-gauge wire carrying handle near its point of balnce which resembles that of the [[FN FAL]]. It also has a \"hold-open\" bolt catch which holds the bolt open after the last round in the magazine has been fired (the bolt release button is just above the magazine release) and has a spring-loaded polymer dust cover that seals the ejection port from debris.\n\nDespite reducing the weight of some components the weight of the HK41 exceeded the weight of the preceding G33, making the HK41 relatively heavy compared to other 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambered assault rifles of its era.\n\n===Barrel===\nThe cold hammer-forged barrel has a hexagonal [[polygonal rifling|polygonal]] bore. It comes rifled for either the NATO-standard, Belgian SS109 62 grain bullet with a twist of 178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) or in a 305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) twist for use with American .223 Remington/5.56\u00d745mm ammunition with the M193 55 grain projectile. The bore chamber is fluted to assist in the extraction of spent cartridges.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\" /> The barrel is equipped with a [[flash suppressor]] that is also designed to launch [[rifle grenade]]s.\n\n===Sights===\n[[File:Heckler & Koch rotating drum sight pictures.png|thumb|''Drehvisier'' rotating drum sight pictures]]\n\nThe firearm is equipped with a relatively low [[iron sight]] line that consists of a ''Drehvisier'' a rotary rear drum and hooded front post. The rear sight is mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation with the help of tools. This deliberately prevents non-armorers to (re)zero the iron sight line. The rotary drum features an open V-notch (numbered 1) for rapid target acquisition, close range, low light and impaired visibility use and three apertures (numbered 2, 3 and 4) used for: {{convert|200|-|400|m|yd|0}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments for more precise aiming. The 1 V-notch and 2 or {{convert|200|m|yd|0}} aperture settings have an identical point of aim. The V-notch and apertures are calibrated for [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] ball ammunition.\n\nThe [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] housing has a NATO pattern optics mount (meeting [[Picatinny rail|STANAG 2324]]) that replaced HK\u2019s claw-mount system sed to mount day (typically the Hensoldt 4\u00d724 telescopic sight) or night aiming optics.\nThe Hensoldt Fero 4\u00d724 [[telescopic sight]] and mount assembly were developed for designated marksman use. The Fero elevation knob features [[Telescopic sight#Bullet Drop Compensation|Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) settings]] for {{convert|100|-|600|m|yd|0}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments calibrated for [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] ball ammunition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drzero.org/cetme/pdf/g3sm.pdf|title=Fero Z24 4\u00d724 telescopic sight for G3 rifle instruction manual|accessdate=25 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823233055/http://www.drzero.org/cetme/pdf/g3sm.pdf|archive-date=23 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\nMany accessories are based on NATO standard or previously issued items.\n\nThe rifle can be fitted with a barrel-mounted [[bipod]] based on the one issued with the M16A1's cleaning kit. It also uses the [[bayonet]] from the G3. It also can mount the '''FERO Z24-G 4\u00d724''' optical sight on a proprietary detachable bracket on the receiver and a clip-on winter trigger.\n\nThe G41 can also mount a detachable [[40 mm]] [[Heckler & Koch HK69A1|HK79]] [[grenade launcher]] that replaces the synthetic forearm. The weapon in this configuration is known as the '''G41TGS''', or '''''\"Tactical Group Support\"'''''.\n\n==Variants==\nNote: the 1:178mm (1:7 in) rifling was compatible with the European-standard SS109 round and the 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling was compatible with the US-standard M193 Ball round.\n*'''G41''': This is the standard model with a fixed stock and 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A1''': This model has a fixed stock and 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A2''': This model has a telescoping shoulder stock and 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A3''': This model features a telescopic stock and a 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling pitch.\n*'''G41K''': This is a [[carbine]] (K\u2014''Karabiner'') variant of the G41A2 with a shortened {{convert|380|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} barrel (reduced in length to the base of the foresight), 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate and a telescopic stock. The G41K is too short to accept the HK79 or fire rifle grenades.\n*'''G41TGS''': The \"Tactical Group Support\" model adds a HK79 [[grenade launcher]].\n*'''LF G41''': [[Luigi Franchi]] made a sample run of the G41, G41A2 and G41K in 1988 for possible production under license; these were later modified for trials by the Italian Army. It differed from the Heckler & Koch model in that it had a polygonal 4-groove barrel with a chromed bore. When the G41 was rejected by the German [[Bundeswehr]] in 1989, it was dropped from consideration and the improved [[Beretta AR70/90]] was chosen instead in 1990. The LF G41 however entered use with the [[Italian commando frogmen]] (COMSUBIN).\n*'''LF Mod. 641''': A modified variant of the G41 also intended to replace the BM59. It lost out to the AR70/90.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only. Please do not add entries into this list without a citation from a reliable source.

The selector is ambidextrous and its lever is mirrored on both sides of the trigger housing. In the \"safe\" position, the trigger and sear are disabled.\n\nThe G41 uses NATO [[STANAG magazine]]s (from the [[M16 rifle]]) with a capacity of 30 rounds. The magazine release is located on the left side of the rifle, above the magazine well.\n\nThe weapon incorporates a manual [[forward assist]] that can be used to positively close the bolt, similar to the one used on the American [[M16_rifle#XM16E1_and_M16A1_(Colt_Model_603)|M16A1]] rifle, and a side-folding heavy-gauge wire carrying handle near its point of balnce which resembles that of the [[FN FAL]]. It also has a \"hold-open\" bolt catch which holds the bolt open after the last round in the magazine has been fired (the bolt release button is just above the magazine release) and has a spring-loaded polymer dust cover that seals the ejection port from debris.\n\nDespite reducing the weight of some components the weight of the HK41 exceeded the weight of the preceeding G33, making the HK41 relatively heavy compared to other 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambered assault rifles of its era.\n\n===Barrel===\nThe cold hammer-forged barrel has a hexagonal [[polygonal rifling|polygonal]] bore. It comes rifled for either the NATO-standard, Belgian SS109 62 grain bullet with a twist of 178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) or in a 305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) twist for use with American .223 Remington/5.56\u00d745mm ammunition with the M193 55 grain projectile. The bore chamber is fluted to assist in the extraction of spent cartridges.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\" /> The barrel is equipped with a [[flash suppressor]] that is also designed to launch [[rifle grenade]]s.\n\n===Sights===\n[[File:Heckler & Koch rotating drum sight pictures.png|thumb|''Drehvisier'' rotating drum sight pictures]]\n\nThe firearm is equipped with a relatively low [[iron sight]] line that consists of a ''Drehvisier'' a rotary rear drum and hooded front post. The rear sight is mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation with the help of tools. This deliberately prevents non-armorers to (re)zero the iron sight line. The rotary drum features an open V-notch (numbered 1) for rapid target acquisition, close range, low light and impaired visibility use and three apertures (numbered 2, 3 and 4) used for: {{convert|200|-|400|m|yd|0}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments for more precise aiming. The 1 V-notch and 2 or {{convert|200|m|yd|0}} aperture settings have an identical point of aim. The V-notch and apertures are calibrated for [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] ball ammunition.\n\nThe [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] housing has a NATO pattern optics mount (meeting [[Picatinny rail|STANAG 2324]]) that replaced HK\u2019s claw-mount system sed to mount day (typically the Hensoldt 4\u00d724 telescopic sight) or night aiming optics.\nThe Hensoldt Fero 4\u00d724 [[telescopic sight]] and mount assembly were developed for designated marksman use. The Fero elevation knob features [[Telescopic sight#Bullet Drop Compensation|Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) settings]] for {{convert|100|-|600|m|yd|0}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments calibrated for [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] ball ammunition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drzero.org/cetme/pdf/g3sm.pdf|title=Fero Z24 4\u00d724 telescopic sight for G3 rifle instruction manual|accessdate=25 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823233055/http://www.drzero.org/cetme/pdf/g3sm.pdf|archive-date=23 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\nMany accessories are based on NATO standard or previously issued items.\n\nThe rifle can be fitted with a barrel-mounted [[bipod]] based on the one issued with the M16A1's cleaning kit. It also uses the [[bayonet]] from the G3. It also can mount the '''FERO Z24-G 4\u00d724''' optical sight on a proprietary detachable bracket on the receiver and a clip-on winter trigger.\n\nThe G41 can also mount a detachable [[40 mm]] [[Heckler & Koch HK69A1|HK79]] [[grenade launcher]] that replaces the synthetic forearm. The weapon in this configuration is known as the '''G41TGS''', or '''''\"Tactical Group Support\"'''''.\n\n==Variants==\nNote: the 1:178mm (1:7 in) rifling was compatible with the European-standard SS109 round and the 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling was compatible with the US-standard M193 Ball round.\n*'''G41''': This is the standard model with a fixed stock and 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A1''': This model has a fixed stock and 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A2''': This model has a telescoping shoulder stock and 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A3''': This model features a telescopic stock and a 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling pitch.\n*'''G41K''': This is a [[carbine]] (K\u2014''Karabiner'') variant of the G41A2 with a shortened {{convert|380|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} barrel (reduced in length to the base of the foresight), 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate and a telescopic stock. The G41K is too short to accept the HK79 or fire rifle grenades.\n*'''G41TGS''': The \"Tactical Group Support\" model adds a HK79 [[grenade launcher]].\n*'''LF G41''': [[Luigi Franchi]] made a sample run of the G41, G41A2 and G41K in 1988 for possible production under license; these were later modified for trials by the Italian Army. It differed from the Heckler & Koch model in that it had a polygonal 4-groove barrel with a chromed bore. When the G41 was rejected by the German [[Bundeswehr]] in 1989, it was dropped from consideration and the improved [[Beretta AR70/90]] was chosen instead in 1990. The LF G41 however entered use with the [[Italian commando frogmen]] (COMSUBIN).\n*'''LF Mod. 641''': A modified variant of the G41 also intended to replace the BM59. It lost out to the AR70/90.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only. Please do not add entries into this list without a citation from a reliable source.

Beginning in February, thousands of citizens launched daily protests demanding reimbursement by the government, which they believed was profiting from the schemes. On 1 March, Prime Minister [[Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi]] resigned and on 2 March, President [[Sali Berisha]] declared a [[state of emergency]]. On 11 March the [[Socialist Party of Albania]] won a major victory when its leader, [[Bashkim Fino]], was appointed prime minister. However, the transfer of power did not halt the unrest, and protests spread to northern Albania.

In the mid-1990s Albania was adopting a [[market economy]], after decades of a [[Stalinist]] [[command economy]] under the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]]. The rudimentary financial system became dominated by [[Ponzi scheme]]s, and government officials endorsed a series of [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid investment funds]]. By January 1997 the schemes (many of which were fronts for [[Money laundering|laundering money]] and [[arms trafficking]]) could no longer make payments. The number of investors who had been lured by the promise of getting rich quick grew to include two-thirds of the population.<ref name=IMF2000/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/alpha/albania1997.htm |title=On War article |publisher=On War article |date=27 November 2003 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref> It is estimated that close to $1.5 billion was invested in companies offering monthly interest rates ranging from 10%-25%, while the average monthly income was around $80. A significant number of Albanians sold their homes to invest, and immigrants working in Greece and Italy transferred additional resources to the schemes.<ref>[http://conflict-prevention.net/page.php?id=40&formid=73&action=show&surveyid=29 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223195348/http://conflict-prevention.net/page.php?id=40&formid=73&action=show&surveyid=29 |date=23 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1996 elections ===\n{{Main|1996 Albanian parliamentary election}}\nOn 26 May 1996, general elections were held and the Democratic Party won by a large margin. The Socialists (PS) accused the government of fraud and rejected the results. PS left the counting process and boycotted the parliament. On 20 October local elections were held. The Democratic Party won again, but the Socialists also rejected this result.\n\n=== Pyramid schemes ===\n{{Main|Pyramid schemes in Albania}}\n\nThe pyramid schemes started operations in 1991. Their activity was based on making payments to old investors using money contributed by new investors. The first scheme was that of Hajdin Sejdis\u00eb, who later fled to Switzerland with several million dollars. It was followed by \"Sudja\" of shoe factory worker Maksude Kad\u00ebna in 1993, then the \"Populli\" foundations run by an opposition politician, and \"Xhaferri\". By the end of 1996 the schemes peaked. The interest rates they offered were very tempting; Sudja offered 100% interest. The schemes were not criticised immediately because of a banking law adopted in 1994 which\u2014on [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) advice\u2014contained no provision that the [[National Bank of Albania]] act as a supervisor of commercial banks. The IMF changed that advice two years later, after the consequences had become visible. Despite IMF advice to close these schemes, the government continued to allow their activities, often participating in them.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Between 8\u201316 January 1997 the schemes collapsed. On 22 January the government froze the Xhaferri and Populli firms. \"Gjallica\", another firm, was nearly bankrupt, while \"Vefa\", which had invested in Albanian hotels, fuel and factories, continued normal activity.\n\nThe first protest was on 16 January in the South. On 19 January in [[Tirana]] demonstrators protested the Sudja creditors. On 24 January the ''de facto'' rebellion began. Thousands of people in Lushnja marched on city hall in protest against the government's support of the schemes. The protest quickly descended into violence. Police forces were routed and the city hall and adjoining cinema were burned. One day later, on 25 January, Democratic Party chair Tritan Shehu was sent to Lushnje to resolve the situation. On his arrival he was held hostage for several hours at City Stadium and assaulted by the protesters. Albanian Special Forces units intervened to extract Shehu. By the morning every government institution in the city was looted and destroyed, except for the Interior Ministry building, which was protected by the Director of Communications, seven of his engineers and a guard who refused to abandon his post.\n\nOn 26 and 27 January violence erupted in other southern towns, such as Vlora. On 30 January the Forum for Democracy was formed by opposition parties to lead the protests. Anger was also directed against Berisha and the government for allowing the schemes to continue despite IMF advice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} As allegations grew that Berisha and others in government had personally profited from the schemes,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} many{{Who|date=January 2012}} became convinced that the Democratic Party had to be removed by force. This was especially true in Vlora. On 4 February distribution of a portion of lost money began at the counters of the National Commercial Bank, owned by the state. Rather than quieting the protests, this action increased people's suspicion. A check for $550,000 paid by the \"Gjallica\" firm on 7 January to the Socialist Party accelerated the firm's collapse. On 5 February Gjallica declared bankruptcy and on 6 February violent protests resumed in Vlora. On 9 February state police were attacked in Vlora and a day later, also in the south, 50 Special Forces troops attacked and brutally dispersed protesters.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n=== North-South conflict ===\nOne of the main themes of Western media and analysts during the March riots was the north-south division. Various newspapers and TV stations claimed that the rebellion was not just a showdown between the two main political forces but a clash between the northerners ([[Ghegs]]) who supported Berisha and southerners ([[Tosks]]) who supported the Socialist Party.\n\n== Hunger strike at the University of Vlora ==\n\nOn 20 February 1997, about 50 students at the [[University of Vlora]] began a [[hunger strike]] on campus, they demanded the government's resignation and the full return of invested money. On 22 February the Forum for Democracy declared its support for the strike. Students from Gjirokast\u00ebr and Elbasan also came to give their support. They were then driven by the FRESSH (Youth Wing of Socialist Party) activists of Vlor\u00eb to Tirana. In contrast, the students of University Luigj Gurakuqi in Shkodra did not take part, and its Students Union declared, \"The students share the pain of the citizens of Vlora in losing money in pyramid schemes, but on the other hand, think that freedom and democracy, homeland and nation have a higher price\".\n\nOn 26 February thousands of people surrounded the building of the university to defend it from a rumoured attack by SHIK (Sh\u00ebrbimi Informativ Komb\u00ebtar), the national intelligence service. The same day a group of strikers requested more medical help, raising doubts about the doctors near them. On 27 February in Vlora Shkodra, mayor Bahri Borici of the United Right declared his support for the hunger strike. The next day was a decisive moment in Albanian history\u2014after strengthening their perimeter around the building of the university, the rebel forces, without warning, attacked the SHIK building. In fighting between the rebels and government forces, nine people\u2014six officers and three civilians\u2014were killed. This incident marked the start of a ten-day civil war and a year of violence in southern Albania.<ref>http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6ac905c.html</ref>\n\n[[File:97-9.jpg|thumb|Angry protesters throwing stones at government forces.]]\n\n==Looting and opening of weapon depots==\n [[File:Viti97.jpg|thumb|Weapon depots looting in 1997.]]\nThe ''Opening of the depots'' ({{sq|Hapja e depove}}) was the opening of weapons depots in the north, for protection against the violence of the south.

The event was described as the one of the greatest robberies in the history of the [[Balkans]]. A group of six people attacked the fortified building of the State Treasury with an [[antitank weapon]]. The total amount of money that was inside the building was US$8 million, but the robbers only managed to acquire US$6 million. The few police still in the city soon arrived at the scene and took control of the remaining assets. Later, the thieves were seen by several witnesses meeting at the outskirts of Shkod\u00ebr, where they divided the money between themselves. After the robbery, the police and investigators began investigations in Shkod\u00ebr. In the spring of 1998, more than a year later, the investigators closed the file and it was given to the police for further investigation.

Most had been imprisoned in Greece, but suddenly escaped and returned to Albania. The most famous case is that of Zani Caushi, who escaped from the high-security prison of [[Larissa]] in February 1997 and, with a group of friends, established the gang of \u00c7ole in Vlora.\n\nIn Vlora five gangs were created, but two ruled the city: the gang of Zani and the gang of Gaxhai. Movement in the city started at 10:00, when people gathered in [[Flag's Square]] to hear the Committee of Rescue, and ended at 13:00. After that hour the streets were deserted and the only people who moved were gang members. Gangs announced through speakers and flyers that other people were not to go out as there would be fighting. Each night brought attacks with explosives and shooting, leaving dozens dead. In Berat Altin Dardha's rule was even more severe. In Lushnje Aldo Bare's gang had control. The worst crime that this gang committed was to behead an opponent. Cities ruled by gangs were Vlora, Berat, Tepelena, Memaliaj, Ballshi, Saranda, Gjirokastra, Lushnja, Pogradec, Cerrik and Tropoja.\n\n*[[Gang of \u00c7ole]] ({{sq|Banda e \u00c7oles}}), in Vlora, led by Myrteza \u00c7aushi,{{sfn|OMR 1997|p=10}} known as \"Partizan\"<ref name=\"Rich2016\"/> and \"Zani\".{{sfn|Arsovska|2015}} Named after \u00c7ole neighbourhood, in the eastern part of the city, which it controlled.<ref name=\"Rich2016\">{{cite book|author=Paul B.

Vlora was controlled by gangs and traffickers, and mass exodus began. In Lushnje police were brutally beaten. News of massacre of SHIK officers shook the government. Rebels took control of the Albanian Navy [[Pasha Liman Base]], a state symbol of resistance. The government reacted by declaring a [[state of emergency]] and sent more troops to areas around Vlora and the town of [[Tepelena]]. In response, rebels set up cannons at the entrance of the city and pointed them towards [[Tirana]]. A massive explosion destroyed an arms storage facility.{{where|date=February 2018}} Himar\u00eb was burning, including police buildings in Gjirokastra.\n* 2 March: [[Alexander Meksi]]'s government resigned after failing to resolve the crisis. The event was celebrated in Vlora and the south by thousands firing [[AK-47]]s into the air as a sign of victory. Parliament approved the chief of Gazideden Union to restore order. Immediately Gazidede ordered indefinite closure of schools throughout the country and imposed restrictions on the press and consumer goods. In Kavaja, bastion of PD, over 5000 people voluntarily armed to defend the city from an envisioned attack by armed gangs. Italian news agency ANSA commented: \"The whole scenario is emerging as a politico-military strategy and not as a manifestation of spontaneous popular. To gather people in the Flag Square are available for days special machines.\"\n* 3 March: President Berisha was re-elected with the votes of DP members of the parliament alone. This led to massive riots in southern and central Albania. The remaining warehouses exploded and remaining bands of the military formed committees. The city of [[Saranda]] was also captured by rebels, with fighters based out of Vlora arriving by boat and burning every government building in the city, including the library. In Vlora, a local detention facility was broken into and more than 400 guns were seized. Gunmen burned down the Vocational Training Centre in Vlora. Meanwhile, SHIK tried to contain the rebellion to Vlora, Saranda and [[Delvina]] to stop it from spreading to the rest of the country. Destruction and killings continued throughout southern Albania. The seven million dollar Vocational Training Centre in Vlora was burned, which had cost the Albanian government. A group of approximately 100-member \"Adipetrol\" was held responsible and their compound in Gjirokastra was raided. Masked raiders captured a warship and rebels attacked Saranda, where police and government buildings were burned. Criminals engineered a prison break, releasing hundreds of prisoners, seized 400 weapons and set fire to the town library. In Ku\u00e7ov\u00eb, a bread shortage was announced. The army recovered control of Fier and  began to disarm the population.\n* 4 March: The Committee of Public Salvation was formed in Vlore, headed by Albert Shyti. This committee began to act as a parallel government. Snipers occupied every building in Vlore and every street put up barricades to prevent attacks by SHIK. The Mifoli Bridge over the [[Vjos\u00eb|River Vjos\u00eb]] was blocked and mined (this bridge\u2014which separated the two parts of Albania\u2014would become a symbol of the rebellion). As students ended their hunger strike, gunmen in Saranda used navy craft to plunder weapons caches. Gangs patrolled the sea using Albanian Navy ships. Outside Saranda one member of SHIK was burnt alive and another was taken hostage, while two others escaped. Fifty soldiers joined the rebels and two Albanian Air Force pilots [[Desertion of 4 March 1997|defected and flew their planes to Italy]]. The pilots claimed they were ordered to attack civilians. Gazidede's plan to isolate the insurgency in Vlora failed, as it spread across the south. After fierce fighting in Delvina, the rebels forced the army to pull back. In Saranda, the rebels put up roadblocks. In the South, more depots exploded. Rebels placed snipers in mansions, locked the Mifolit bridge and raised barricades to prevent entry of the military and SHIK. In Shkodra, the army capitulated and the hunger strike ended. In Saranda, organised gangs raided an Albanian Navy base  and captured thousands of weapons. The [[Salvation Committees|Public Salvation Committee of Vlore]] was formed. It began to act as a parallel government by conducting a \"de facto\" coup. Its leader was Albert Shyti. The main collaborator of the \"Committee\" was Myrteza Caushi, known as Zani \"The strongman of Vlora\". Under the example of  Vlora, Shyti created \"Salvation Committees\" everywhere in Albania. Demonstrators would never have succeeded in overpowering the [[Vlora]] police if they had not been armed and organised by local [[organised crime]] bosses and former members of the Communist-era [[secret police]] ([[Sigurimi]]), who saw this as their chance to damage the new political system. Typical of the latter was Albert Shyti, who returned from Greece with a private arsenal and set himself up as the head of the Vlora \"[[Committee of Public Salvation|Salvation Committees]]\"\u2014a pattern replicated in other towns and cities in southern Albania.\n* 5 March: Warehouses in Memaliaj and other places were blown up. Rebels burned police buildings in these cities. Greek TV \"Mega\" stated, \"Today, armed groups in southern Albania raised the banner of Northern Epirus for the first time. They demand the separation of the southern part from the rest of the country, ranging from Tepelena, thus proclaiming the autonomy of southern Albania. Albania's longstanding problem has been that of North-South autonomy, which is divided along the Shkumbin river.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n* 6 March: President Berisha held a meeting with representatives of political parties to sign a statement, condemning the massive plunder and destruction of military warehouses and calling for surrender of weapons. Six hours later, the SP and DAP leaders denied any responsibility and obligation towards the statement that they had earlier described as a \"political success\". Greek TV \"Sky\" News stated, \"A few minutes have emerged from the meeting the leaders of armed groups of Saranda, who have decided to attack tonight at  Gjirokastra. They will not leave and anxiously await today's popular trial will be done with three prisoners captured in the main square of Sarande, who allegedly attacked SHIK employees and northern ethnics that increases the balance of victims in Vlora.\"\n* 7 March: The rebels from Saranda, in collaboration with local army forces, entered [[Gjirokastra]] and took some Albanian Special Forces troops hostage. The leaders of the revolt in Gjirokastra were members of PAD, [[Arben Imami]] (appointed Defence Minister later in 2009) and Ridvan P\u00ebshk\u00ebpia. With the fall of Gjirokastra, the entire south of the country was out of government control. Weapons continued to spread across the country. Tirana's [[Rinas International Airport]] was attacked by villagers from the surrounding area, and the Agricultural University of Tirana was looted. Albanian Army soldiers defected to rebels in Gjirokastra. Military assets were taken by gangs and the city's military committee. With  Gjirokastra in the hands of rebels, the entire south of the country was out of control. Weapons continued to spread. National Rinas Airport was attacked by villagers from the surrounding areas.\n* 8 March: President Berisha organised a meeting with all parties concerned with the creation of the new government.

Although the government quelled revolts in the north, the ability of the government and military to maintain order began to collapse, especially in the southern half of Albania, which fell under the control of rebels and criminal gangs.<ref name=\"globalsecurity\">{{cite web|first=John|last=Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/albania.htm |title=Albanian Civil War (1997) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nAll major population centres were engulfed in demonstrations by 13 March and foreign countries began to evacuate their citizens.

In the mid-1990s Albania was adopting a [[market economy]], after decades of a [[Stalinist]] [[command economy]] under the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]]. The rudimentary financial system became dominated by [[Ponzi scheme]]s, and government officials endorsed a series of [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid investment funds]]. By January 1997 the schemes (many of which were fronts for [[Money laundering|laundering money]] and [[arms trafficking]]) could no longer make payments. The number of investors who had been lured by the promise of getting rich quick grew to include two-thirds of the population.<ref name=IMF2000/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/alpha/albania1997.htm |title=On War article |publisher=On War article |date=27 November 2003 |accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref> It is estimated that close to $1.5 billion was invested in companies offering monthly interest rates ranging from 10%-25%, while the average monthly income was around $80. A significant number of Albanians sold their homes to invest, and immigrants working in Greece and Italy transferred additional resources to the schemes.<ref>[http://conflict-prevention.net/page.php?id=40&formid=73&action=show&surveyid=29 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223195348/http://conflict-prevention.net/page.php?id=40&formid=73&action=show&surveyid=29 |date=23 December 2011 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1996 elections ===\n{{Main|1996 Albanian parliamentary election}}\nOn 26 May 1996, general elections were held and the Democratic Party won by a large margin. The Socialists (PS) accused the government of fraud and rejected the results. PS left the counting process and boycotted the parliament. On 20 October local elections were held. The Democratic Party won again, but the Socialists also rejected this result.\n\n=== Pyramid schemes ===\n{{Main|Pyramid schemes in Albania}}\n\nThe pyramid schemes started operations in 1991. Their activity was based on making payments to old investors using money contributed by new investors. The first scheme was that of Hajdin Sejdis\u00eb, who later fled to Switzerland with several million dollars. It was followed by \"Sudja\" of shoe factory worker Maksude Kad\u00ebna in 1993, then the \"Populli\" foundations run by an opposition politician, and \"Xhaferri\". By the end of 1996 the schemes peaked. The interest rates they offered were very tempting; Sudja offered 100% interest. The schemes were not criticised immediately because of a banking law adopted in 1994 which\u2014on [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) advice\u2014contained no provision that the [[National Bank of Albania]] act as a supervisor of commercial banks. The IMF changed that advice two years later, after the consequences had become visible. Despite IMF advice to close these schemes, the government continued to allow their activities, often participating in them.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Between 8\u201316 January 1997 the schemes collapsed. On 22 January the government froze the Xhaferri and Populli firms. \"Gjallica\", another firm, was nearly bankrupt, while \"Vefa\", which had invested in Albanian hotels, fuel and factories, continued normal activity.\n\nThe first protest was on 16 January in the South. On 19 January in [[Tirana]] demonstrators protested the Sudja creditors. On 24 January the ''de facto'' rebellion began. Thousands of people in Lushnja marched on city hall in protest against the government's support of the schemes. The protest quickly descended into violence. Police forces were routed and the city hall and adjoining cinema were burned. One day later, on 25 January, Democratic Party chair Tritan Shehu was sent to Lushnje to resolve the situation. On his arrival he was held hostage for several hours at City Stadium and assaulted by the protesters. Albanian Special Forces units intervened to extract Shehu. By the morning every government institution in the city was looted and destroyed, except for the Interior Ministry building, which was protected by the Director of Communications, seven of his engineers and a guard who refused to abandon his post.\n\nOn 26 and 27 January violence erupted in other southern towns, such as Vlora. On 30 January the Forum for Democracy was formed by opposition parties to lead the protests. Anger was also directed against Berisha and the government for allowing the schemes to continue despite IMF advice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} As allegations grew that Berisha and others in government had personally profited from the schemes,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} many{{Who|date=January 2012}} became convinced that the Democratic Party had to be removed by force. This was especially true in Vlora. On 4 February distribution of a portion of lost money began at the counters of the National Commercial Bank, owned by the state. Rather than quieting the protests, this action increased people's suspicion. A check for $550,000 paid by the \"Gjallica\" firm on 7 January to the Socialist Party accelerated the firm's collapse. On 5 February Gjallica declared bankruptcy and on 6 February violent protests resumed in Vlora. On 9 February state police were attacked in Vlora and a day later, also in the south, 50 Special Forces troops attacked and brutally dispersed protesters.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n=== North-South conflict ===\nOne of the main themes of Western media and analysts during the March riots was the north-south division. Various newspapers and TV stations claimed that the rebellion was not just a showdown between the two main political forces but a clash between the northerners ([[Ghegs]]) who supported Berisha and southerners ([[Tosks]]) who supported the Socialist Party.\n\n== Hunger strike at the University of Vlora ==\n\nOn 20 February 1997, about 50 students at the [[University of Vlora]] began a [[hunger strike]] on campus, they demanded the government's resignation and the full return of invested money. On 22 February the Forum for Democracy declared its support for the strike. Students from Gjirokast\u00ebr and Elbasan also came to give their support. They were then driven by the FRESSH (Youth Wing of Socialist Party) activists of Vlor\u00eb to Tirana. In contrast, the students of University Luigj Gurakuqi in Shkodra did not take part, and its Students Union declared, \"The students share the pain of the citizens of Vlora in losing money in pyramid schemes, but on the other hand, think that freedom and democracy, homeland and nation have a higher price\".\n\nOn 26 February thousands of people surrounded the building of the university to defend it from a rumoured attack by SHIK (Sh\u00ebrbimi Informativ Komb\u00ebtar), the national intelligence service. The same day a group of strikers requested more medical help, raising doubts about the doctors near them. On 27 February in Vlora Shkodra, mayor Bahri Borici of the United Right declared his support for the hunger strike. The next day was a decisive moment in Albanian history\u2014after strengthening their perimeter around the building of the university, the rebel forces, without warning, attacked the SHIK building. In fighting between the rebels and government forces, nine people\u2014six officers and three civilians\u2014were killed. This incident marked the start of a ten-day civil war and a year of violence in southern Albania.<ref>http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6ac905c.html</ref>\n\n[[File:97-9.jpg|thumb|Angry protesters throwing stones at government forces.]]\n\n==Looting and opening of weapon depots==\n [[File:Viti97.jpg|thumb|Weapon depots looting in 1997.]]\nThe ''Opening of the depots'' ({{sq|Hapja e depove}}) was the opening of weapons depots in the north, for protection against the violence of the south.

The event was described as the one of the greatest robberies in the history of the [[Balkans]]. A group of six people attacked the fortified building of the State Treasury with an [[antitank weapon]]. The total amount of money that was inside the building was US$8 million, but the robbers only managed to acquire US$6 million. The few police still in the city soon arrived at the scene and took control of the remaining assets. Later, the thieves were seen by several witnesses meeting at the outskirts of Shkod\u00ebr, where they divided the money between themselves. After the robbery, the police and investigators began investigations in Shkod\u00ebr.

After that hour the streets were deserted and the only people who moved were gang members. Gangs announced through speakers and flyers that other people were not to go out as there would be fighting. Each night brought attacks with explosives and shooting, leaving dozens dead. In Berat Altin Dardha's rule was even more severe. In Lushnje Aldo Bare's gang had control.

In Vlora, a local detention facility was broken into and more than 400 guns were seized. Gunmen burned down the Vocational Training Centre in Vlora.

The main collaborator of the \"Committee\" was Myrteza Caushi, known as Zani \"The strongman of Vlora\". Under the example of  Vlora, Shyti created \"Salvation Committees\" everywhere in Albania. Demonstrators would never have succeeded in overpowering the [[Vlora]] police if they had not been armed and organised by local [[organised crime]] bosses and former members of the Communist-era [[secret police]] ([[Sigurimi]]), who saw this as their chance to damage the new political system.

June: The [[Democratic Party of Albania|Democrat leadership]] was unable to operate a normal campaign in southern Albania. Their campaign was accompanied by riots in those cities, leaving behind more than 60 people killed.\n* 29 June: Parliamentary elections were held. Socialist Party allies won while the Democrats suffered the biggest loss in their history. Many of the members of the \"[[Salvation Committees]]\" came out for leftist candidates though they promised they would not get a government position without resolving the crisis. On election day a referendum was held over the form of governance. The Republic prevailed over monarchy with 65% of the votes.\n\n=== July ===\n* 3 July: Leka Zogu I organised a demonstration accusing CEC of rigging the [[Albanian monarchy referendum, 1997|result]]. Five people were killed in a clash between demonstrators and police.\n* July: Gangs continue to rule cities with fear and terror. Murders, robberies and trafficking of weapons, people and drugs increased.\n* 24 July: Berisha resigned. He had promised that if the Socialists won he would leave because they could not endure \"institutional cohabitation\" with them. Rexhep Meidani was elected President. Massive gunfire in Tirana celebrated Berisha's resignation. The insurgency ended.\n\n=== August ===\n* 11 August: Operation Alba's military forces left the country.\n\n==Casualties==\nAccording to Christopher Jarvis, there were 2,000 killed.{{sfn|Jarvis|2000}} According to Fred C. Abrahams, between March and May 1997 some 1,600 people were killed, most in shootouts between rival gangs.{{sfn|Abrahams|2016|p=219}} An [[UNIDIR]] document claimed more than 2,000 killed in March alone.{{sfn|Mugumya|2005|p=34}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nDamage from the rebellion was estimated at US$200 million dollars and some 3700 to 5000 wounded. Lawsuits were filed against the bosses of the rogue firms.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Various members of the government, including Safet Zhulali and Agim Shehu, were sentenced in absentia.\n\nIn elections in June and July 1997, Berisha and his party were voted out of power, and the leftist coalition headed by the [[Socialist Party of Albania|Socialist Party]] won. The Socialist party elected [[Rexhep Meidani]] as President of the Albanian Republic.

During the late 1990s, he was considered to be a superstar in making. But most of the films with Biju Menon as the hero failed at the box office, in spite of his good performance, though his roles as second hero were popular. He acted with [[Suresh Gopi]] in hit movies like ''[[Pathram]]'', ''F. I. R.'' and ''[[Chinthamani Kolacase]]''. During the later 1990s and early 2000s he appeared in a few offbeat movies with directors like [[T. V.
