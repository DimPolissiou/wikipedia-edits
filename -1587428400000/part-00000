He distrusted his ministers and other officials that had served his predecessors and gradually reduced their role in his regime, concentrating absolute power over the Empire's governance in his own hands. Taking a hard-line against Western involvement in Ottoman affairs, he emphasized the Empire's \"Islamic\" character, reasserted his status as the [[Caliph]], and called for Muslim unity behind the Caliphate. Abdul-Hamid strengthened the Empire's position somewhat, and succeeded briefly in reasserting Islamic power, by building numerous schools, reducing the national debt, and embarking on projects aimed at revitalizing the Empire's decaying infrastructure.\n\nThe coup by the three Pashas in 1909 marked the end of his reign. Western-inclined Turkish military officers opposed to Abdul-Hamid's rule had steadily organized in the form of secret societies within and outside [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]]. By 1906, the movement enjoyed the support of a significant portion of the army, and its leaders formed the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP), informally known as the [[Young Turk]] Party. The Young Turks sought to remodel administration of the Empire along Western lines. Their ideology was [[nationalist]] in character, and was a precursor of the movement that would seize control of Turkey following [[World War I]]. CUP leaders presented their ideas to the public as a revival of true Islamic principles. Under the leadership of [[Enver Pasha]], a Turkish military officer, the CUP launched a military coup against the Sultan in 1908, proclaiming a new regime on 6 July. Though they left Abdul-Hamid on his throne, the Young Turks compelled him to restore the parliament and constitution he had suspended thirty years earlier, thereby creating a constitutional monarchy and stripping the Caliphate of its authority.\n\n===Counter-coup and 31 March Incident===\n{{Main|Countercoup (1909)|31 March Incident}}\nA counter-coup launched by soldiers loyal to the Sultan threatened the new government but ultimately failed. After nine months into the new parliamentary term, discontent and reaction found expression in a fundamentalist movement, the counter-revolutionary [[31 March Incident]], which actually occurred on 13 April 1909. Many aspects of this revolt, which started within certain sections of the mutinying army in Constantinople, are still yet to be analyzed. Its generally admitted perception of a \"reactionary\" movement has sometimes been challenged, given the results and effects on the young political system.\n\nAbdul-Hamid was deposed on 13 April 1909. He was replaced by his brother Rashid Effendi, who was proclaimed Sultan [[Mehmed V]] on 27 April.\n\n===Mehmed V, 1909\u201318===\n====With Libya====\nIn 1911 [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] warred with the Ottomans over [[Ottoman Libya|Libya]], and Turkey's failure to defend these regions demonstrated the weakness of the Ottoman military. In 1912 [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]], and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] formed the [[Balkan League]], an anti-Ottoman alliance that subsequently launched a joint attack on the Ottoman Empire. The ensuing [[Balkan Wars]] eliminated what little presence the Ottomans had left in Europe, and only infighting between the Balkan League allies prevented them from advancing into Anatolia.\n\nInternally, the Ottomans continued to be troubled by political instability. Nationalist uprisings that had plagued the Empire sporadically for the past fifty years intensified. The masses were growing frustrated with chronic misgovernance and the Ottomans' poor showing in military conflicts. In response, the CUP led a second ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' in 1913 and seized absolute control of the government. For the next five years, the Empire was a one-party state ruled by the CUP under the leadership of [[Enver Pasha]] (who returned to Constantinople after having served Turkey abroad in various military and diplomatic capacities since the initial coup), Minister of the Interior [[Talat Pasha]], and Minister of the Navy [[Cemal Pasha]]. Though the Sultan was retained, he made no effort to exercise power independent of the Young Turks and was effectively their [[puppet ruler|puppet]]. The Caliphate was thus held nominally by Mehmed V, but the authority attached to the office rested with the Young Turks.\n\n====World War I====\n{{See also|Middle Eastern theater of World War I}}\nAs [[World War I]] broke out in Europe, the Young Turks struck an alliance with [[German Empire|Germany]], a move that would have disastrous consequences. The Empire entered the war on the side of the [[Central Powers]] in November 1914, and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] immediately declared war on Ottoman Empire. {{Citation needed|reason=disputed order of events|date=July 2013}} During the development of the war, the empire's position continued to deteriorate, and even in the Middle East \u2013 the very heartland of the [[Islamic world]] \u2013 would soon be lost.\n\n=====Call for Jihad=====\nThough the Young Turks had compelled the Sultan in his capacity as the Caliph to declare a [[jihad]] urging all Muslims to resist Allied encroachment on their lands, the effort was largely unsuccessful. The Young Turk government resigned en masse and Enver, Talat, and Cemal fled Turkey aboard a German warship. Sultan [[Mehmed VI]], who was proclaimed Sultan after his brother Mehmed V died of a heart attack in July, agreed to an armistice. The [[Armistice of Mudros]] formalizing Ottoman surrender was signed aboard a British warship on October 30, 1918. Allied troops arrived in Constantinople and occupied the Sultan's palace shortly thereafter.[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0AAZldl8k4G5MNLeIG&id=trmPvyYVRhgC&pg=PA17&as_brr=1]\n\n====Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire====\n{{Main|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Occupation of Constantinople|Khilafat Movement|Treaty of S\u00e8vres}}\nBy the end of the war, the Ottomans had lost virtually their entire Empire. Hoping to keep his throne and preserve the Ottoman dynasty in some form or another, the Sultan agreed to cooperate with the Allies. He dissolved parliament and allowed an Allied military administration to replace the government vacated by the Young Turks.\n\n====Khilafat Movement====\n{{See also|Khilafat Movement}}\nThe [[Khilafat movement]] (1919\u20131924) was a political campaign launched mainly by Muslims in [[British Raj|British controlled India]] to influence the British government to protect the Caliphate during the [[aftermath of World War I]].\n\nThe defeat of the Ottomans and the Allied occupation of Constantinople left the Ottoman state and the Caliphate with no solid basis.

However, under Allied direction, the Sultan pledged to suppress such movements and secured an official [[fatwa]] from the [[Sheikh ul-Islam]] declaring them to be un-Islamic.<ref name=\"Gingeras 95\">{{cite book|last=Gingeras|first=Ryan|title=Sorrowful SHores|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780199561520|pages=95}}</ref> But the nationalists steadily gained momentum and began to enjoy widespread support. Many sensed that the nation was ripe for revolution. In an effort to neutralize this threat, the Sultan agreed to hold elections, with the hope of placating and co-opting the nationalists. To his dismay, nationalist groups swept the polls, prompting him to again dissolve parliament in April 1920.\n\nInitially, the National Assembly<!-- established April 1920? --> seemed willing to allow a place for the Caliphate in the new regime, agreeing to the appointment of Mehmed's cousin [[Abdulmejid II|Abd\u00fclmecid]] as caliph<!-- in Ankara? --> upon Mehmed's departure<!-- from Constantinople? --> (November 1922). But the position had been stripped of any authority, and Abd\u00fclmecid's purely ceremonial reign would be short lived. [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] had been a vocal critic of the Ottoman House and its Islamic orientation. When Abd\u00fclmecid was declared caliph, Kemal refused to allow the traditional Ottoman ceremony to take place, bluntly declaring: {{quote|The Caliph has no power or position except as a nominal figurehead.}}\n\nIn response to Abd\u00fclmecid's petition for an increase in his allowance, Kemal wrote: {{quote|Your office, the Caliphate, is nothing more than a historic relic. It has no justification for existence. It is a piece of impertinence that you should dare write to any of my secretaries!}}\n\nStill, for all the power he had already wielded in Turkey, Kemal did not dare to abolish the Caliphate outright, as it still commanded a considerable degree of support from the common people.\n\nThen an event happened which was to deal a fatal blow to the Caliphate. Two Indian brothers, [[Maulana Mohammad Ali]] and [[Maulana Shaukat Ali]], leaders of the Indian-based [[Khilafat Movement]], distributed pamphlets calling upon the Turkish people to preserve the Ottoman Caliphate for the sake of Islam.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/event/Khilafat-movement Khilafat movement | Indian Muslim movement | Britannica.com]</ref> Under Turkey's new nationalist government, however, this was construed as foreign intervention, and any form of foreign intervention was labelled an insult to Turkish sovereignty, and worse, a threat to State security. Kemal promptly seized his chance. On his initiative, the National Assembly abolished the Caliphate on March 3, 1924. Abd\u00fclmecid was sent into exile along with the remaining members of the Ottoman House.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9cTHyUQoTyUC&pg=PA546&lpg=PA642&focus=viewpor&output=html_text|title= Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire|first= Caroline|last= Finkel|authorlink= Caroline Finkel|publisher= [[Basic Books]]|year= 2007|isbn= 9780465008506|page= 546}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAhcJj-ij28C&pg=PA6&dq=Abdul+Medjid+II+last+caliph&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSuOqH2bHXAhXHXBoKHQH8CpAQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=Abdul%20Medjid%20II%20last%20caliph&f=false|title=From Caliphate to Secular State: Power Struggle in the Early Turkish Republic|last=\u00d6zo\u011flu|first=Hakan|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313379567|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Islam in the Ottoman Empire]]\n*[[Caliphate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Deringil, Selim.  \"Legitimacy Structures in the Ottoman State: The Reign of Abdulhamid II (1876-1909), ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (August, 1991).\n* Haddad, Mahmoud.  \"Arab Religious Nationalism in the Colonial Era: Rereading Rashid Rida's Ideas on the Caliphate\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 117, No. 2 (April, 1997).\n* Kedourie, Elie.  \"The End of the Ottoman Empire\", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (October, 1968).\n* Lewis, Bernard.  \"The Ottoman Empire and Its Aftermath\", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (January, 1980).\n* Hussain, Ishtiaq. \"The Tanzimat: Secular Reforms in the Ottoman Empire\", [https://web.archive.org/web/20120112145701/http://faith-matters.org/resources/publicationsreports/252-the-tanzimat-secular-reforms-in-the-ottoman-empire Faith Matters] (October 2011)\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.waitmeturkey.com/ottoman-caliphate.html Ottoman Caliphate]\n\n{{Sultans of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Organisation of the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n[[Category:1517 establishments in the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:1924 disestablishments in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Caliphates]]\n[[Category:Government of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:History of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Islam in the Ottoman Empire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Ottoman Empire}}{{Caliphate}}\nThe '''Ottoman Caliphate''', under the [[Ottoman dynasty]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], was the last [[Sunni Islam]]ic [[caliphate]] of the late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and the early [[modern era|modern]] era.

To his dismay, nationalist groups swept the polls, prompting him to again dissolve parliament in April 1920.\n\nInitially, the National Assembly<!-- established April 1920? --> seemed willing to allow a place for the Caliphate in the new regime, agreeing to the appointment of Mehmed's cousin [[Abdulmejid II|Abd\u00fclmecid]] as caliph<!-- in Ankara? --> upon Mehmed's departure<!-- from Constantinople? --> (November 1922). But the position had been stripped of any authority, and Abd\u00fclmecid's purely ceremonial reign would be short lived. [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] had been a vocal critic of the Ottoman House and its Islamic orientation. When Abd\u00fclmecid was declared caliph, Kemal refused to allow the traditional Ottoman ceremony to take place, bluntly declaring: {{quote|The Caliph has no power or position except as a nominal figurehead.}}\n\nIn response to Abd\u00fclmecid's petition for an increase in his allowance, Kemal wrote: {{quote|Your office, the Caliphate, is nothing more than a historic relic. It has no justification for existence. It is a piece of impertinence that you should dare write to any of my secretaries!}}\n\nStill, for all the power he had already wielded in Turkey, Kemal did not dare to abolish the Caliphate outright, as it still commanded a considerable degree of support from the common people.\n\nThen an event happened which was to deal a fatal blow to the Caliphate. Two Indian brothers, [[Maulana Mohammad Ali]] and [[Maulana Shaukat Ali]], leaders of the Indian-based [[Khilafat Movement]], distributed pamphlets calling upon the Turkish people to preserve the Ottoman Caliphate for the sake of Islam.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/event/Khilafat-movement Khilafat movement | Indian Muslim movement | Britannica.com]</ref> Under Turkey's new nationalist government, however, this was construed as foreign intervention, and any form of foreign intervention was labelled an insult to Turkish sovereignty, and worse, a threat to State security. Kemal promptly seized his chance. On his initiative, the National Assembly abolished the Caliphate on March 3, 1924. Abd\u00fclmecid was sent into exile along with the remaining members of the Ottoman House.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9cTHyUQoTyUC&pg=PA546&lpg=PA642&focus=viewpor&output=html_text|title= Osman's Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire|first= Caroline|last= Finkel|authorlink= Caroline Finkel|publisher= [[Basic Books]]|year= 2007|isbn= 9780465008506|page= 546}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAhcJj-ij28C&pg=PA6&dq=Abdul+Medjid+II+last+caliph&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSuOqH2bHXAhXHXBoKHQH8CpAQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=Abdul%20Medjid%20II%20last%20caliph&f=false|title=From Caliphate to Secular State: Power Struggle in the Early Turkish Republic|last=\u00d6zo\u011flu|first=Hakan|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313379567|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Islam in the Ottoman Empire]]\n*[[Caliphate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Deringil, Selim.  \"Legitimacy Structures in the Ottoman State: The Reign of Abdulhamid II (1876-1909), ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (August, 1991).\n* Haddad, Mahmoud.  \"Arab Religious Nationalism in the Colonial Era: Rereading Rashid Rida's Ideas on the Caliphate\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 117, No. 2 (April, 1997).\n* Kedourie, Elie.  \"The End of the Ottoman Empire\", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (October, 1968).\n* Lewis, Bernard.  \"The Ottoman Empire and Its Aftermath\", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (January, 1980).\n* Hussain, Ishtiaq. \"The Tanzimat: Secular Reforms in the Ottoman Empire\", [https://web.archive.org/web/20120112145701/http://faith-matters.org/resources/publicationsreports/252-the-tanzimat-secular-reforms-in-the-ottoman-empire Faith Matters] (October 2011)\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.waitmeturkey.com/ottoman-caliphate.html Ottoman Caliphate]\n\n{{Sultans of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Organisation of the Ottoman Empire}}\n\n[[Category:1517 establishments in the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:1924 disestablishments in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Caliphates]]\n[[Category:Government of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:History of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Islam in the Ottoman Empire]]\n", "name_user": "KazekageTR", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Caliphate"}

The Taguig River, a tributary of the [[Pasig River]], cuts through the northern half of the city while the Napindan River, another tributary of the Pasig, forms the common border of Taguig with Pasig.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe original farmer-fishermen of the area, about 800 in number, were good at threshing rice after harvest. Hence they were referred to as \"''mga taga-giik'',\" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"rice thresher\") and the settlement as \"''pook ng mga taga-giik''.\" Spanish friar Fray Alonso de Alvarado, together with conquistador [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] who crossed [[Pasig River]] to reach the city's present site in 1571, found \"taga-giik\" difficult to pronounce. \"Tagui-ig\" was later shortened to its current form \"Taguig\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.taguig.gov.ph/our-city/history/|title=History|website=Official Website of The City of Taguig|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore the [[Spaniards]] came, Taguig was a part of [[Namayan]] and [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] ruled by [[Lakandula]]. There were also accounts that [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] settlements were once present in the area as revealed by the recent archaeological diggings of various artifacts like cups, plates and other utensils, which bear Chinese characters. This was believed to have originated from China's [[Ming dynasty]].\n\nTaguig was one of the earliest known territories to have been Christianized when the Spaniards succeeded in subjugating mainland Luzon through the [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi|Legazpi]] expedition in 1571. Between the years 1582 and 1583, Taguig was part of the encomienda of Tondo headed by an alcalde mayor, Captain Vergara. It was in 1587 when Taguig was established as a separate \"[[pueblo]]\" (town) of the then province of [[Manila]]. Captain Juan Basi was its Kapitan from 1587 to 1588. According to records, Taguig had nine (9) barrios then namely, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Hagonoy, Palingon, Santa Ana, Tipas, Tuktukan, Ususan, and Wawa. Records show that Tipas had once petitioned to become an independent town but was denied by the Spanish government.\n\nDuring that time, Taguig was accessible via the [[Pasig River]], which was connected to two large bodies of water, the [[Manila Bay]] and [[Laguna de Bay]]. The population then was estimated to be 800 tributes. The town produced more than enough rice for consumption but had less sugar cane to mill. The men lived through fishing while women wove cotton cloth and \"sawali\" from bamboo strips. The people of Taguig were known to have resisted both Spanish and American colonial rule. During that early period of Spanish colonization. Don Juan Basi, \"Kapitan\" of Taguig from 1587 to 1588, took part in the [[Tondo Conspiracy]], an attempt to overthrow the Spanish government which failed. Basi was exiled for two years as punishment. When the [[Katipunan]] was on its early years, many from Taguig became followers and later joined the uprising. The people of Taguig also joined the revolutionary government of General Emilio Aguinaldo on August 6, 1898.\n\nDuring the [[United States|American]] occupation, they struggled against the forces of General Wheaton under the command of General Pio del Pilar. It was recorded that on February 6, 1898, Filipino forces including Taguig \"revolutionarios\" dislodged an American position in the hills of Taguig, now a portion of [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] and [[Fort Bonifacio]]. They were defeated eventually by the Americans with superiority in the armaments and training. Taguig finally fell to the contingent of the First Washington Volunteer Infantry led by Col. Wholly.\n\nThe defeat of the Filipinos after two years of struggle against the American forces subsequently subjected the Philippines to another system of governance. On August 14, 1898, United States occupied the islands and established a military government with General Wesley Meritt as the First Military Governor. He exercised legislative powers until September 1, 1900. At the start of American occupation, Taguig was proclaimed as an independent municipality with the promulgation of General Order No. 4 on March 29, 1900. The town was subsequently incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal when the Philippine Commission promulgated Act. No. 137 on June 11, 1901. On October 12, 1903, Taguig, [[Muntinlupa]] and [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] were merged by the virtue of Act. No. 942 with Pateros hosting the seat of the municipal government. The merger did not last long as a month later Muntinlupa was segregated from it and made part of [[Bi\u00f1an]] when Act. No. 1008 was enacted on November 25, 1903. However it was returned to Taguig on March 22, 1905 with the promulgation Act. No. 1308. On February 29, 1908, Taguig was again declared an independent municipality through Executive Order No. 20. Eventually, Pateros separated from Taguig and both became independent municipalities of Rizal province on January 1, 1918.\n\nIt was also during the American Colonial Period that the US government acquired a 25.78&nbsp;km\u00b2 property of Taguig for military purposes. This large piece of land, which had a TCT dated 1902, was turned into a camp that became known as Fort McKinley (named after [[William McKinley]], 25th president of the U.S.). When the Japanese occupied the Philippines in 1942, Fort McKinley was taken over by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]. They occupied the military camp until the end of the war in 1945. After the Philippines gained its political independence from the [[United States]] on July 4, 1946, the US surrendered the Republic of the Philippines all right of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of the military bases. On May 14, 1949, [[Fort William McKinley]] was turned over to the Philippine government by virtue of the US Embassy Note No. 0570. Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed [[Fort Bonifacio]] after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Andres Bonifacio.\n\nThe town's political subdivision was changed to barangays following the nationwide implementation of the Integrated Reorganization Plan (IRP) in the 1970s when the country was under [[Martial Law]]. The IRP has increased its subdivisions into 18 barangays, namely, Bagong Tanyag, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Calzada, Hagonoy, Ibayo-Tipas, Ligid-Tipas, Lower Bicutan, Maharlika, Napindan, Palingon, Signal Village, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Upper Bicutan, Ususan, Wawa, and Western Bicutan. On November 7, 1975, Taguig seceded from the province of Rizal to form the [[National Capital Region]] through Presidential Decree No. 824.\n\nIn 1998, a bill was passed in Congress pushing for the cityhood of Taguig. The resulting plebiscite in April showed that the citizens were against cityhood. A recent petition to the Supreme Court sought a recount of the plebiscite and the Supreme Court on February 19, 2004 ordered the Commission on Elections to conduct a recount. The recount showed that the residents did want the municipality of Taguig to become a city (21,105 'yes' and 19,460 'no'). Subsequently, Taguig became a city on December 8, 2004. In 2008, the City Council created 10 new barangays, carving them out from the initial 18 barangays. Hence, in December 2008, after a successful plebiscite, the numbers of barangays in the city increased from 10 to 28 barangays. The 10 newly created barangays were Central Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, Fort Bonifacio, Katuparan, North Signal Village, South Signal Village, South Daanghari, North Daanghari, Pinagsama, San Miguel, and Tanyag.\n\nIn 2011, doing 424th foundation day of Taguig, former Mayor (now Congresswoman) Lani Cayetano takes pride in calling the city a \u201cProbinSyudad\u201d because it is the only remaining city in Metro Manila which has the amenities of a highly urbanized city, yet has the feel and relaxing atmosphere of a province plus its people exude the values and magandang asal of the probinsyano, what with its more than 10 kilometers of lakeshore, with farmers, fishermen, old churches, a historic lighthouse, and with people whose virtue of pagtutulungan is still very much alive.\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Taguig\n| 1903 = 6829\n| 1918 = 8423\n| 1939 = 12087\n| 1948 = 15340\n| 1960 = 21856\n| 1970 = 55257\n| 1975 = 73702\n| 1980 = 134137\n| 1990 = 266637\n| 1995 = 381350\n| 2000 = 467375\n| 2007 = 613343\n| 2010 = 644473\n| 2015 = 804915\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}}\n}}\n\n==Local government==\n{{See also|Cities of the Philippines}}\nLike other cities in the Philippines, Taguig is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head and leads the city's departments in executing the city ordinances and improving public services. The city mayor is restricted to three consecutive terms, totaling nine years, although a mayor can be elected again after an interruption of one term. The vice mayor heads a legislative council consisting of 18 members: 8 councilors from the First District, 8 councilors from the Second District, the president of the Sangguniang Kabataan (Youth Council) Federation, representing the youth sector, and the president of the Association of Barangay Chairmen (ABC) as barangay sectoral representative.

The Taguig River, a tributary of the [[Pasig River]], cuts through the northern half of the city while the Napindan River, another tributary of the Pasig, forms the common border of Taguig with Pasig.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe original farmer-fishermen of the area, about 800 in number, were good at threshing rice after harvest. Hence they were referred to as \"''mga taga-giik'',\" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"rice thresher\") and the settlement as \"''pook ng mga taga-giik''.\" Spanish friar Fray Alonso de Alvarado, together with conquistador [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] who crossed [[Pasig River]] to reach the city's present site in 1571, found \"taga-giik\" difficult to pronounce. \"Tagui-ig\" was later shortened to its current form \"Taguig\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.taguig.gov.ph/our-city/history/|title=History|website=Official Website of The City of Taguig|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore the [[Spaniards]] came, Taguig was a part of [[Namayan]] and [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] ruled by [[Lakandula]]. There were also accounts that [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] settlements were once present in the area as revealed by the recent archaeological diggings of various artifacts like cups, plates and other utensils, which bear Chinese characters. This was believed to have originated from China's [[Ming dynasty]].\n\nTaguig was one of the earliest known territories to have been Christianized when the Spaniards succeeded in subjugating mainland Luzon through the [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi|Legazpi]] expedition in 1571. Between the years 1582 and 1583, Taguig was part of the encomienda of Tondo headed by an alcalde mayor, Captain Vergara. It was in 1587 when Taguig was established as a separate \"[[pueblo]]\" (town) of the then province of [[Manila]]. Captain Juan Basi was its Kapitan from 1587 to 1588. According to records, Taguig had nine (9) barrios then namely, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Hagonoy, Palingon, Santa Ana, Tipas, Tuktukan, Ususan, and Wawa. Records show that Tipas had once petitioned to become an independent town but was denied by the Spanish government.\n\nDuring that time, Taguig was accessible via the [[Pasig River]], which was connected to two large bodies of water, the [[Manila Bay]] and [[Laguna de Bay]]. The population then was estimated to be 800 tributes. The town produced more than enough rice for consumption but had less sugar cane to mill. The men lived through fishing while women wove cotton cloth and \"sawali\" from bamboo strips. The people of Taguig were known to have resisted both Spanish and American colonial rule. During that early period of Spanish colonization. Don Juan Basi, \"Kapitan\" of Taguig from 1587 to 1588, took part in the [[Tondo Conspiracy]], an attempt to overthrow the Spanish government which failed. Basi was exiled for two years as punishment. When the [[Katipunan]] was on its early years, many from Taguig became followers and later joined the uprising. The people of Taguig also joined the revolutionary government of General Emilio Aguinaldo on August 6, 1898.\n\nDuring the [[United States|American]] occupation, they struggled against the forces of General Wheaton under the command of General Pio del Pilar. It was recorded that on February 6, 1898, Filipino forces including Taguig \"revolutionarios\" dislodged an American position in the hills of Taguig, now a portion of [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] and [[Fort Bonifacio]]. They were defeated eventually by the Americans with superiority in the armaments and training. Taguig finally fell to the contingent of the First Washington Volunteer Infantry led by Col. Wholly.\n\nThe defeat of the Filipinos after two years of struggle against the American forces subsequently subjected the Philippines to another system of governance. On August 14, 1898, United States occupied the islands and established a military government with General Wesley Meritt as the First Military Governor. He exercised legislative powers until September 1, 1900. At the start of American occupation, Taguig was proclaimed as an independent municipality with the promulgation of General Order No. 4 on March 29, 1900. The town was subsequently incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal when the Philippine Commission promulgated Act. No. 137 on June 11, 1901. On October 12, 1903, Taguig, [[Muntinlupa]] and [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] were merged by the virtue of Act. No. 942 with Pateros hosting the seat of the municipal government. The merger did not last long as a month later Muntinlupa was segregated from it and made part of [[Bi\u00f1an]] when Act. No. 1008 was enacted on November 25, 1903. However it was returned to Taguig on March 22, 1905 with the promulgation Act. No. 1308. On February 29, 1908, Taguig was again declared an independent municipality through Executive Order No. 20. Eventually, Pateros separated from Taguig and both became independent municipalities of Rizal province on January 1, 1918.\n\nIt was also during the American Colonial Period that the US government acquired a 25.78&nbsp;km\u00b2 property of Taguig for military purposes. This large piece of land, which had a TCT dated 1902, was turned into a camp that became known as Fort McKinley (named after [[William McKinley]], 25th president of the U.S.). When the Japanese occupied the Philippines in 1942, Fort McKinley was taken over by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]. They occupied the military camp until the end of the war in 1945. After the Philippines gained its political independence from the [[United States]] on July 4, 1946, the US surrendered the Republic of the Philippines all right of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of the military bases. On May 14, 1949, [[Fort William McKinley]] was turned over to the Philippine government by virtue of the US Embassy Note No. 0570. Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed [[Fort Bonifacio]] after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Andres Bonifacio.\n\nThe town's political subdivision was changed to barangays following the nationwide implementation of the Integrated Reorganization Plan (IRP) in the 1970s when the country was under [[Martial Law]]. The IRP has increased its subdivisions into 18 barangays, namely, Bagong Tanyag, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Calzada, Hagonoy, Ibayo-Tipas, Ligid-Tipas, Lower Bicutan, Maharlika, Napindan, Palingon, Signal Village, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Upper Bicutan, Ususan, Wawa, and Western Bicutan. On November 7, 1975, Taguig seceded from the province of Rizal to form the [[National Capital Region]] through Presidential Decree No. 824.\n\nIn 1998, a bill was passed in Congress pushing for the cityhood of Taguig. The resulting plebiscite in April showed that the citizens were against cityhood. A recent petition to the Supreme Court sought a recount of the plebiscite and the Supreme Court on February 19, 2004 ordered the Commission on Elections to conduct a recount. The recount showed that the residents did want the municipality of Taguig to become a city (21,105 'yes' and 19,460 'no'). Subsequently, Taguig became a city on December 8, 2004. In 2008, the City Council created 10 new barangays, carving them out from the initial 18 barangays. Hence, in December 2008, after a successful plebiscite, the numbers of barangays in the city increased from 10 to 28 barangays. The 10 newly created barangays were Central Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, Fort Bonifacio, Katuparan, North Signal Village, South Signal Village, South Daanghari, North Daanghari, Pinagsama, San Miguel, and Tanyag.\n\nIn 2011, doing 424th foundation day of Taguig, former Mayor (now Congresswoman) Lani Cayetano takes pride in calling the city a \u201cProbinSyudad\u201d because it is the only remaining city in Metro Manila which has the amenities of a highly urbanized city, yet has the feel and relaxing atmosphere of a province plus its people exude the values and magandang asal of the probinsyano, what with its more than 10 kilometers of lakeshore, with farmers, fishermen, old churches, a historic lighthouse, and with people whose virtue of pagtutulungan is still very much alive.\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Taguig\n| 1903 = 6829\n| 1918 = 8423\n| 1939 = 12087\n| 1948 = 15340\n| 1960 = 21856\n| 1970 = 55257\n| 1975 = 73702\n| 1980 = 134137\n| 1990 = 266637\n| 1995 = 381350\n| 2000 = 467375\n| 2007 = 613343\n| 2010 = 644473\n| 2015 = 804915\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}}\n}}\n\n==Local government==\n{{See also|Cities of the Philippines}}\nLike other cities in the Philippines, Taguig is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms.

The community lies within Limestone Creek Township.  Joshua Hoshirama Raynor was once elected as Hokage for his ninja prowess and his incredible jutsu. \n\n==History==\n\n===Native American presence===\n\nThe earliest Native Americans thought to have roamed the area were the [[Joara]] (whose settlements date back to AD 1000), based out of present-day [[Burke County, North Carolina|Burke County]]. The Joara were the chiefdom of the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] culture. Immediately prior to European colonization in the early 18th century, the coastal plain of North Carolina was home to many distinct Native American tribes: the Coree, Coharie, several small [[Neusiok]] communities, and the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]]. This latter tribe gradually became the most dominant in the region as smaller tribes were either exterminated by Europeans or peacefully assimilated into the Tuscarora for collective security. By the time of permanent European settlement, the Tuscarora were utilizing the heavily forested areas of eastern Duplin County as a hunting ground.\n\nNative American burial mounds are numerous in Duplin County, in the rural areas surrounding Beulaville especially. There are four sizable mounds within a ten-mile radius of the town, the two largest being in the vicinity of [[Hallsville, North Carolina|Hallsville]] and [[Sarecta, North Carolina|Sarecta]]. Combined, these mounds contain roughly one hundred bodies.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/notesonindianbur00holm \"Notes on the Indian burial mounds of eastern North Carolina\"]. Retrieved 2013-11-19.</ref>\n\n===European settlement===\n\nThe arrival of the [[German Palatines|Palatines]] at [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] and the ensuing wave of [[English people|English]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] settlers sparked a conflict known as the [[Tuscarora War]] (1710\u20131715). With the elimination of the last [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] stronghold at [[Fort Neoheroka]] and subsequent exodus of the remainder of the tribe to [[New York (state)|New York]] (they became the sixth nation of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]), the interior of the coastal plain was made available for European settlement. Many of the original European settlers of what is now Beulaville arrived from [[Jones County, North Carolina|Jones]], [[Onslow County, North Carolina|Onslow]], [[Beaufort County, North Carolina|Beaufort]], and [[Craven County, North Carolina|Craven]] counties.\n\nIn 1736, Duplin County (then upper [[New Hanover County, North Carolina|New Hanover County]]) was the destination of several hundred [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] (Scotch-Irish) and a handful of [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Protestants]]. They settled on a plot of land, {{convert|71160|acre}} between the [[Northeast Cape Fear River]] and [[Black River (North Carolina)|Black River]], obtained from the Crown by Henry McCulloh of London.<ref>[http://www.carolana.com/NC/Royal_Colony/nc_royal_colony_henry_mcculloch.html]</ref> Their first settlements were Soracta (Sarecta) on the Northeast Cape Fear, an area at the lower end of Goshen Swamp (then called Woodward's Chase), and the grove where the Duplin County Courthouse now stands.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://duplin.lostsoulsgenealogy.com/wd_history.htm| title=Duplin County History to 1810| author=William Dickson| publisher=Duplin County community website| accessdate=November 30, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124201604/http://duplin.lostsoulsgenealogy.com/wd_history.htm| archive-date=January 24, 2016| url-status=dead}}</ref> According to census records, several families of Sarecta and the settlement at the south end of Goshen Swamp had gravitated to the crossroads of what would become Beulaville by the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBeulaville proper was founded as \"Snatchet\" in 1873 out of necessity for a trading center for nearby farmers and those in the business of logging and [[turpentine]] production. Also colloquially referred to as \"Tearshirt\" by locals, the town was once notorious for [[alcoholism]] and frequent street brawls. Indeed, the manufacture and distribution of [[corn liquor]] remained a steady source of income for many families well into the 20th century. Upon demolition of a prominent downtown building (which had formerly served as a soda shop in the 1950s) to make way for a McDonald's, a [[moonshine]] still and several barrels of the drink were uncovered in the basement.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.wral.com| title=Rowdy Town| publisher=WRAL.com |date=February 18, 2008| accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Trains/ICC valuations/Kinston\u2013Carolina Railroad and Lumber Company|Kinston Carolina Railroad and Lumber Company]] constructed a railway from [[Kinston, North Carolina|Kinston]] to [[Pink Hill, North Carolina|Pink Hill]] around 1900. In response, residents of Limestone Creek Township spent $15,000 to lobby for the creation of the \"Duplin County Railroad\" in 1916, extending the Kinston line through Beulaville and [[Chinquapin, North Carolina|Chinquapin]]. The rail, which ran alongside present-day Railroad Street, has since been destroyed.<ref>Report of the Corporation Commission for the Biennial Period ..., Issue 19</ref> The post office of Snatchet was officially re-designated \"Beulaville\" in 1910, and the town was incorporated five years later. The town's name is derived from the Beulah Baptist Church (now the Beulaville Baptist Church). Beulaville is the most recent town to be incorporated in Duplin County.\n[[File:Archie Lanier's Store.jpg|thumb|300px|Archie Lanier's Store]]\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Former Beulaville High School.jpg|thumb|300px|Former Beulaville High School]]\n\nIn 1839, the county passed a tax for the creation of a public school system. Several decades later (sometime around 1870) the first public school in what would become Beulaville was constructed. The facility - which was no more than a small wood cabin - employed only one teacher. By 1901, however, four teachers were working out of the schoolhouse.<ref>[http://www.freefeast.com/userpages/Beulaville1.shtml \"Beulaville, North Carolina: A History\"]. Retrieved 2013-11-19.</ref> In 1906, property was purchased for a new school. A new two-story wooden building was erected and first used in the school year of 1917-1918; the enrollment for that year was nearly 200. Three additions \u2013 the auditorium, gym, and band building \u2013 were added in 1923, and additional tracts of land were purchased for the school between 1933 and 1950. On November 6, 1945, the school's main building burned to the ground. Only the John Hargett Gymnasium and auditorium were spared. School continued in these buildings and the teacherage located next door until the fall of 1947, when the elementary school building was rebuilt and a new high school building had been constructed. [[Potters Hill, North Carolina|Potter's Hill]] Elementary merged with Beulaville in 1960, and [[desegregation|integration]] was implemented shortly after.\n\nBeulaville is home to one elementary/middle school (Beulaville Elementary) and one secondary school (East Duplin High School). The mascot for both schools, as well as nearby B. F. Grady, is the panther, referring to the [[North American cougar|eastern cougar]] which once roamed the swamps and forests of eastern North Carolina. East Duplin High School was built in 1963 and consolidates the elementary schools of Beulaville, B. F. Grady, and Chinquapin.\n\n==Recreation==\n[[File:Banks of the Northeast Cape Fear.JPG|thumb|300px|On the banks of the [[Northeast Cape Fear River]] at [[Hallsville, North Carolina|Hallsville]]]]\n\nSituated {{convert|4|mi|0}} east of the meandering [[Northeast Cape Fear River]], Beulaville offers much in the way of outdoor recreation. There are two boat landings on the Northeast Cape Fear River within a {{convert|7|mi|0|adj=on}} radius of town. The communal landing at [[Hallsville, North Carolina|Hallsville]], which had, for centuries, been used by locals for activities ranging from baptisms to bonfires, has been closed off to the public. The other landing is located west of Beulaville, off Highway 24, half way to Kenansville. Several golf courses can also be found near Beulaville and in the greater Duplin area.\n\nWithin the town limits there are three public parks providing a variety of recreational needs, to include the William Ray Humphrey Athletic Park, a ballpark converted from the former elementary school's recreational fields.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.townofbeulaville.com/parksrecreation.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-12-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125081535/http://www.townofbeulaville.com/parksrecreation.htm |archive-date=2016-01-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The park, located behind the Beulaville Municipal Complex, boasts three baseball fields, two tennis courts, two outdoor basketball courts, and the John Hargett indoor gymnasium.\n\n{{convert|5|mi|0}} north of Beulaville on Highway 111, the 167-acre Cabin Lake County Park attracts many locals and visitors for year-round camping, canoeing, and hiking.<ref>http://www.visitnc.com/listing/cabin-lake-recreational-park</ref> Additionally, the Tarkil Branch Farm Museum at Cedar Fork, {{convert|7|mi|0}} southeast of Beulaville, features a genuine 1830s homestead complete with over 850 artifacts; the operation is situated on a 375-acre working farm.<ref>http://www.tarkilfarmsmuseum.com/index2.htm</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nThe manufacture of [[naval stores]] and lumbering were the first marketable enterprises for the families inhabiting what is now Limestone Creek Township. These commodities were ferried down the Northeast Cape Fear River (which, in the early nineteenth century, had been made navigable) to [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. As demand for naval stores fell, however, the cultivation of corn and, most importantly, [[tobacco]] moved to the forefront. As many of the small-scale tobacco growers dropped out of the market due to [[Tobacco Buyout|tobacco buyouts]], an economic stimulus was needed; it came in the form of hogs. Agriculture is still the economic lifeline of Beulaville (Duplin now boasts the second highest hog-to-human ratio in the country),<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.umich.edu/~snre492/statter.html| title=Environmental Justice Case Study: Hog Farming in North Carolina| publisher=University of Michigan students| accessdate=November 30, 2015}}</ref> though service industries and manufacturing jobs are gradually supplanting this tradition. [[Viticulture]] has noticeably increased throughout the area over the past decade as well. The [[Global TransPark|North Carolina Global TransPark]], a {{convert|2500|acre|adj=on}} multi-modal industrial air terminal, is located {{convert|30|mi}} to the north in Kinston and is a perk for industry to locate to the area. Beulaville has also benefited from its proximity to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]] {{convert|35|mi}} to the southeast in both traffic volume on NC 24 en route to [[Interstate 40]] and in job opportunities for citizens.\n[[File:Duplin-county-nc-tobacco-barn-1040875.jpg|thumb|300px|Roadside tobacco barn near Sarecta]]\n[[File:NationalSpinning.jpg|thumb|300px|National Spinning, Beulaville location]]\n\n===Notable nearby employers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The community lies within Limestone Creek Township.\n\n==History==\n\n===Native American presence===\n\nThe earliest Native Americans thought to have roamed the area were the [[Joara]] (whose settlements date back to AD 1000), based out of present-day [[Burke County, North Carolina|Burke County]]. The Joara were the chiefdom of the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] culture. Immediately prior to European colonization in the early 18th century, the coastal plain of North Carolina was home to many distinct Native American tribes: the Coree, Coharie, several small [[Neusiok]] communities, and the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]]. This latter tribe gradually became the most dominant in the region as smaller tribes were either exterminated by Europeans or peacefully assimilated into the Tuscarora for collective security. By the time of permanent European settlement, the Tuscarora were utilizing the heavily forested areas of eastern Duplin County as a hunting ground.\n\nNative American burial mounds are numerous in Duplin County, in the rural areas surrounding Beulaville especially. There are four sizable mounds within a ten-mile radius of the town, the two largest being in the vicinity of [[Hallsville, North Carolina|Hallsville]] and [[Sarecta, North Carolina|Sarecta]]. Combined, these mounds contain roughly one hundred bodies.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/notesonindianbur00holm \"Notes on the Indian burial mounds of eastern North Carolina\"]. Retrieved 2013-11-19.</ref>\n\n===European settlement===\n\nThe arrival of the [[German Palatines|Palatines]] at [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] and the ensuing wave of [[English people|English]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] settlers sparked a conflict known as the [[Tuscarora War]] (1710\u20131715). With the elimination of the last [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] stronghold at [[Fort Neoheroka]] and subsequent exodus of the remainder of the tribe to [[New York (state)|New York]] (they became the sixth nation of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]), the interior of the coastal plain was made available for European settlement. Many of the original European settlers of what is now Beulaville arrived from [[Jones County, North Carolina|Jones]], [[Onslow County, North Carolina|Onslow]], [[Beaufort County, North Carolina|Beaufort]], and [[Craven County, North Carolina|Craven]] counties.\n\nIn 1736, Duplin County (then upper [[New Hanover County, North Carolina|New Hanover County]]) was the destination of several hundred [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] (Scotch-Irish) and a handful of [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Protestants]]. They settled on a plot of land, {{convert|71160|acre}} between the [[Northeast Cape Fear River]] and [[Black River (North Carolina)|Black River]], obtained from the Crown by Henry McCulloh of London.<ref>[http://www.carolana.com/NC/Royal_Colony/nc_royal_colony_henry_mcculloch.html]</ref> Their first settlements were Soracta (Sarecta) on the Northeast Cape Fear, an area at the lower end of Goshen Swamp (then called Woodward's Chase), and the grove where the Duplin County Courthouse now stands.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://duplin.lostsoulsgenealogy.com/wd_history.htm| title=Duplin County History to 1810| author=William Dickson| publisher=Duplin County community website| accessdate=November 30, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124201604/http://duplin.lostsoulsgenealogy.com/wd_history.htm| archive-date=January 24, 2016| url-status=dead}}</ref> According to census records, several families of Sarecta and the settlement at the south end of Goshen Swamp had gravitated to the crossroads of what would become Beulaville by the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nBeulaville proper was founded as \"Snatchet\" in 1873 out of necessity for a trading center for nearby farmers and those in the business of logging and [[turpentine]] production. Also colloquially referred to as \"Tearshirt\" by locals, the town was once notorious for [[alcoholism]] and frequent street brawls. Indeed, the manufacture and distribution of [[corn liquor]] remained a steady source of income for many families well into the 20th century. Upon demolition of a prominent downtown building (which had formerly served as a soda shop in the 1950s) to make way for a McDonald's, a [[moonshine]] still and several barrels of the drink were uncovered in the basement.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.wral.com| title=Rowdy Town| publisher=WRAL.com |date=February 18, 2008| accessdate=November 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Trains/ICC valuations/Kinston\u2013Carolina Railroad and Lumber Company|Kinston Carolina Railroad and Lumber Company]] constructed a railway from [[Kinston, North Carolina|Kinston]] to [[Pink Hill, North Carolina|Pink Hill]] around 1900. In response, residents of Limestone Creek Township spent $15,000 to lobby for the creation of the \"Duplin County Railroad\" in 1916, extending the Kinston line through Beulaville and [[Chinquapin, North Carolina|Chinquapin]]. The rail, which ran alongside present-day Railroad Street, has since been destroyed.<ref>Report of the Corporation Commission for the Biennial Period ..., Issue 19</ref> The post office of Snatchet was officially re-designated \"Beulaville\" in 1910, and the town was incorporated five years later. The town's name is derived from the Beulah Baptist Church (now the Beulaville Baptist Church). Beulaville is the most recent town to be incorporated in Duplin County.\n[[File:Archie Lanier's Store.jpg|thumb|300px|Archie Lanier's Store]]\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Former Beulaville High School.jpg|thumb|300px|Former Beulaville High School]]\n\nIn 1839, the county passed a tax for the creation of a public school system. Several decades later (sometime around 1870) the first public school in what would become Beulaville was constructed. The facility - which was no more than a small wood cabin - employed only one teacher. By 1901, however, four teachers were working out of the schoolhouse.<ref>[http://www.freefeast.com/userpages/Beulaville1.shtml \"Beulaville, North Carolina: A History\"]. Retrieved 2013-11-19.</ref> In 1906, property was purchased for a new school. A new two-story wooden building was erected and first used in the school year of 1917-1918; the enrollment for that year was nearly 200. Three additions \u2013 the auditorium, gym, and band building \u2013 were added in 1923, and additional tracts of land were purchased for the school between 1933 and 1950. On November 6, 1945, the school's main building burned to the ground. Only the John Hargett Gymnasium and auditorium were spared. School continued in these buildings and the teacherage located next door until the fall of 1947, when the elementary school building was rebuilt and a new high school building had been constructed. [[Potters Hill, North Carolina|Potter's Hill]] Elementary merged with Beulaville in 1960, and [[desegregation|integration]] was implemented shortly after.\n\nBeulaville is home to one elementary/middle school (Beulaville Elementary) and one secondary school (East Duplin High School). The mascot for both schools, as well as nearby B. F. Grady, is the panther, referring to the [[North American cougar|eastern cougar]] which once roamed the swamps and forests of eastern North Carolina. East Duplin High School was built in 1963 and consolidates the elementary schools of Beulaville, B. F. Grady, and Chinquapin.\n\n==Recreation==\n[[File:Banks of the Northeast Cape Fear.JPG|thumb|300px|On the banks of the [[Northeast Cape Fear River]] at [[Hallsville, North Carolina|Hallsville]]]]\n\nSituated {{convert|4|mi|0}} east of the meandering [[Northeast Cape Fear River]], Beulaville offers much in the way of outdoor recreation. There are two boat landings on the Northeast Cape Fear River within a {{convert|7|mi|0|adj=on}} radius of town. The communal landing at [[Hallsville, North Carolina|Hallsville]], which had, for centuries, been used by locals for activities ranging from baptisms to bonfires, has been closed off to the public. The other landing is located west of Beulaville, off Highway 24, half way to Kenansville. Several golf courses can also be found near Beulaville and in the greater Duplin area.\n\nWithin the town limits there are three public parks providing a variety of recreational needs, to include the William Ray Humphrey Athletic Park, a ballpark converted from the former elementary school's recreational fields.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.townofbeulaville.com/parksrecreation.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-12-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125081535/http://www.townofbeulaville.com/parksrecreation.htm |archive-date=2016-01-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The park, located behind the Beulaville Municipal Complex, boasts three baseball fields, two tennis courts, two outdoor basketball courts, and the John Hargett indoor gymnasium.\n\n{{convert|5|mi|0}} north of Beulaville on Highway 111, the 167-acre Cabin Lake County Park attracts many locals and visitors for year-round camping, canoeing, and hiking.<ref>http://www.visitnc.com/listing/cabin-lake-recreational-park</ref> Additionally, the Tarkil Branch Farm Museum at Cedar Fork, {{convert|7|mi|0}} southeast of Beulaville, features a genuine 1830s homestead complete with over 850 artifacts; the operation is situated on a 375-acre working farm.<ref>http://www.tarkilfarmsmuseum.com/index2.htm</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nThe manufacture of [[naval stores]] and lumbering were the first marketable enterprises for the families inhabiting what is now Limestone Creek Township. These commodities were ferried down the Northeast Cape Fear River (which, in the early nineteenth century, had been made navigable) to [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. As demand for naval stores fell, however, the cultivation of corn and, most importantly, [[tobacco]] moved to the forefront. As many of the small-scale tobacco growers dropped out of the market due to [[Tobacco Buyout|tobacco buyouts]], an economic stimulus was needed; it came in the form of hogs. Agriculture is still the economic lifeline of Beulaville (Duplin now boasts the second highest hog-to-human ratio in the country),<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.umich.edu/~snre492/statter.html| title=Environmental Justice Case Study: Hog Farming in North Carolina| publisher=University of Michigan students| accessdate=November 30, 2015}}</ref> though service industries and manufacturing jobs are gradually supplanting this tradition. [[Viticulture]] has noticeably increased throughout the area over the past decade as well. The [[Global TransPark|North Carolina Global TransPark]], a {{convert|2500|acre|adj=on}} multi-modal industrial air terminal, is located {{convert|30|mi}} to the north in Kinston and is a perk for industry to locate to the area. Beulaville has also benefited from its proximity to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]] {{convert|35|mi}} to the southeast in both traffic volume on NC 24 en route to [[Interstate 40]] and in job opportunities for citizens.\n[[File:Duplin-county-nc-tobacco-barn-1040875.jpg|thumb|300px|Roadside tobacco barn near Sarecta]]\n[[File:NationalSpinning.jpg|thumb|300px|National Spinning, Beulaville location]]\n\n===Notable nearby employers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In his first years as clockmaker, his workshop was located in [[St Martin's Le Grand]], and his house was in Blow Bladder Street, before moving to Mark Lane End in Tower Street in 1687. In 1699 he was elected as the youngest Warden of the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|Clockmakers' Company]], and sat on committees alongside [[Thomas Tompion]], preceding him as Master of the Company in 1702, as well as alongside [[Charles Gretton]] (Master of the Company in 1700). His son Thomas completed his apprenticeship, subsequently working as a journeyman, and free of the Clockmakers' Company in about 1695. Thomas also served as Master of the Company, in 1718. The partnership J & T Windmills also took over Thomas Tompion's clock maintenance contract at the [[Tower of London]] and at [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich]] and other Crown contracts.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Gibson |url=http://davidgibson.co.uk/grandfather_clocks_018.htm |title=Joseph Windmills Information |publisher=Davidgibson.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-18}}</ref>\n\nWindmills was regarded as one of the finest clockmakers in seventeenth century London, producing a large number of [[lantern clock]]s, [[bracket clock]]s, [[longcase clock]]s and pocket watches.

His son Thomas completed his apprenticeship, subsequently working as a journeyman, and free of the Clockmakers' Company in about 1695. Thomas also served as Master of the Company, in 1718.

{"title_page": "Phoenix (mythology)", "text_new": "{{short description|Long-lived bird that is cyclically regenerated or reborn in Greek mythology}}charli damilio \n{{Other uses|Phoenix (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Phoenix-Fabelwesen.jpg|thumb|right|A phoenix depicted in a book of legendary creatures by [[Friedrich Justin Bertuch|FJ Bertuch]] (1747\u20131822)]]\n[[File:Belgique - Bruxelles - Maison de la Louve - 18.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|<div style=\"text-align:center\">The phoenix on the gable roof of the baroque house ''Maison de la Louve'' in [[Brussels]].</div>]]\n\nIn [[Ancient Greek folklore]], a '''phoenix''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|i\u02d0|n|\u1d7b|k|s}}; {{lang-grc|\u03c6\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b9\u03be}}, ''pho\u00eenix'') is a long-lived bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the [[ash]]es of its predecessor. Some legends say it dies in a show of flames and combustion, others that it simply dies and decomposes before being born again.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA146 146]}} Most accounts say that it lived for 500 years before rebirth.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA67 67&ndash;70]}} [[Herodotus]], [[Lucan]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Pope Clement I]], [[Lactantius]], [[Ovid]], and [[Isidore of Seville]] are among those who have contributed to the retelling and transmission of the phoenix motif. The phoenix symbolized renewal in general, as well as entities and concepts such as the Sun, time, the [[Roman Empire]], [[Christ (title)|Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], and [[virginity]].{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA9 9]}}\nhi\n==Etymology==\nThe modern ''phoenix'' comes from Latin ''phoen\u012bx'' via [[Old English]]. The Latin word comes from Greek {{wiktgrc|\u03c6\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b9\u03be}} ''phoin\u012bx''.{{Sfn | Barnhart | 1995 | p = 564}} The Greek word is first attested in the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''po-ni-ke'', which probably meant '[[griffin]]', though it might have meant 'palm tree'. That word is probably a borrowing from a [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] word for [[madder]], a red dye made from ''[[Rubia tinctorum]]''. The word ''[[Phoenicia|Phoenician]]'' appears to be from the same root, meaning 'those who work with red dyes'. So ''phoenix'' may mean 'the Phoenician bird' or 'the purplish-red bird'.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 62\u201366}}\n\nThe spellings ''ph\u0153nix'' and ''phenix'' are rare nowadays.\n\n==Egyptian origin hypothesis and the ''Bennu''==\nClassical discourse on the subject of the phoenix points to a potential origin of the phoenix in [[Ancient Egypt]]. [[Herodotus]], writing in the 5th century BC, gives a somewhat skeptical account of the phoenix. For example:\n \n{{quote|[The Egyptians] have also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I myself have never seen, except in pictures. Indeed it is a great rarity, even in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old phoenix dies. Its size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are as follow:\u2013 The plumage is partly red, partly golden, while the general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle. They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there buries the body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then he hollows out the ball and puts his parent inside, after which he covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then of exactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt, plastered over as I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such is the story they tell of the doings of this bird.<ref>Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories (1858 translation)]]'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.2.ii.html Book II] Trans. G. Rawlinson (1858)</ref>}}\n\nIn the 19th century, scholastic suspicions appeared to be confirmed by the discovery that Egyptians in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] had venerated the [[Bennu]], a solar bird similar in some respects to the Greek phoenix.  However, the Egyptian sources regarding the bennu are often problematic and open to a variety of interpretations. Some of these sources may have actually been influenced by Greek notions of the phoenix, rather than the other way around.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 14\u201325}}\n\n==Appearance==\nThe phoenix is sometimes pictured in ancient and medieval literature and medieval art as endowed with a [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]], which emphasizes the bird's connection with the Sun.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} In the oldest images of phoenixes on record these nimbuses often have seven rays, like [[Helios]] (the Greek personification of the Sun).{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 246\u2013247}} Pliny the Elder<ref>''Ancient Magic and the Supernatural in the Modern Visual and Performing Arts'', edited by Filippo Carl\u00e0-Uhink, Irene Berti, 2016, page 172</ref> also describes the bird as having a crest of feathers on its head,<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D10%3Achapter%3D2 10.2]</ref>{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} and [[Ezekiel the Tragedian|Ezekiel the Dramatist]] compared it to a rooster.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}}\n\nAlthough the phoenix was generally believed to be colorful and vibrant, sources provide no clear consensus about its coloration. [[Tacitus]] says that its color made it stand out from all other birds.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 253}} Some said that the bird had peacock-like coloring, and [[Herodotus]]'s claim of the Phoenix being red and yellow is popular in many versions of the story on record.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 259}} Ezekiel the Dramatist declared that the phoenix had red legs and striking yellow eyes,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}} but [[Lactantius]] said that its eyes were blue like sapphires{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 256}} and that its legs were covered in yellow-gold scales with rose-colored talons.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 257\u2013258}}\n\nHerodotus, Pliny, [[Solinus]], and [[Philostratus]] describe the phoenix as similar in size to an eagle,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 251}} but Lactantius and Ezekiel the Dramatist both claim that the phoenix was larger, with Lactantius declaring that it was even larger than an ostrich.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 252}}\n\n==In Gnostic texts==\nIdeas taking the phoenix into consideration presented themselves in the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] manuscript [[On the Origin of the World]] from the [[Nag Hammadi Library]] collection:\n\n{{quote|Thus when [[Eve#Gnosticism|Sophia Zoe]] saw that the rulers of darkness had laid a curse upon her counterparts, she was indignant. And coming out of the first heaven with full power, she chased those rulers out of their heavens and cast them into the sinful world, so that there they should dwell, in the form of evil spirits upon the earth.\n[...], so that in their world it might pass the thousand years in paradise - a soul-endowed living creature called \"phoenix\". It kills itself and brings itself back to life as a witness to the judgement against them, for they did wrong to [[Adam]] and his race, unto the consummation of the age. There are [...] three men, and also his posterities, unto the consummation of the world: the spirit-endowed of eternity, and the soul-endowed, and the earthly. Likewise, there are three phoenixes in paradise - the first is immortal, the second lives 1,000 years; as for the third, it is written in the sacred book that it is consumed. So, too, there are three baptisms - the first is spiritual, the second is by fire, the third is by water. Just as the phoenix appears as a witness concerning the [[angel|angels]], so the case of the water hydri in Egypt, which has been a witness to those going down into the baptism of a true man. The two bulls in Egypt posses a mystery, the Sun and the Moon, being a witness to [[Archon (Gnosticism)#Naming and associations|Sabaoth]]: namely, that over them [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] received the universe; from the day that she made the Sun and Moon, she put a seal upon her heaven, unto eternity. And the worm that has been born out of the phoenix is a human being as well. It is written concerning it, \"the just man will blossom like a phoenix\". And the phoenix first appears in a living state, and dies, and rises again, being a sign of what has become apparent at the consummation of the age.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[James M.

Some legends say it dies in a show of flames and combustion, others that it simply dies and decomposes before being born again.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA146 146]}} Most accounts say that it lived for 500 years before rebirth.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA67 67&ndash;70]}} [[Herodotus]], [[Lucan]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Pope Clement I]], [[Lactantius]], [[Ovid]], and [[Isidore of Seville]] are among those who have contributed to the retelling and transmission of the phoenix motif. The phoenix symbolized renewal in general, as well as entities and concepts such as the Sun, time, the [[Roman Empire]], [[Christ (title)|Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], and [[virginity]].{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA9 9]}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe modern ''phoenix'' comes from Latin ''phoen\u012bx'' via [[Old English]]. The Latin word comes from Greek {{wiktgrc|\u03c6\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b9\u03be}} ''phoin\u012bx''.{{Sfn | Barnhart | 1995 | p = 564}} The Greek word is first attested in the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''po-ni-ke'', which probably meant '[[griffin]]', though it might have meant 'palm tree'. That word is probably a borrowing from a [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] word for [[madder]], a red dye made from ''[[Rubia tinctorum]]''. The word ''[[Phoenicia|Phoenician]]'' appears to be from the same root, meaning 'those who work with red dyes'. So ''phoenix'' may mean 'the Phoenician bird' or 'the purplish-red bird'.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 62\u201366}}\n\nThe spellings ''ph\u0153nix'' and ''phenix'' are rare nowadays.\n\n==Egyptian origin hypothesis and the ''Bennu''==\nClassical discourse on the subject of the phoenix points to a potential origin of the phoenix in [[Ancient Egypt]]. [[Herodotus]], writing in the 5th century BC, gives a somewhat skeptical account of the phoenix. For example:\n \n{{quote|[The Egyptians] have also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I myself have never seen, except in pictures. Indeed it is a great rarity, even in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old phoenix dies. Its size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are as follow:\u2013 The plumage is partly red, partly golden, while the general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle. They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there buries the body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then he hollows out the ball and puts his parent inside, after which he covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then of exactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt, plastered over as I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such is the story they tell of the doings of this bird.<ref>Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories (1858 translation)]]'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.2.ii.html Book II] Trans. G. Rawlinson (1858)</ref>}}\n\nIn the 19th century, scholastic suspicions appeared to be confirmed by the discovery that Egyptians in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] had venerated the [[Bennu]], a solar bird similar in some respects to the Greek phoenix.  However, the Egyptian sources regarding the bennu are often problematic and open to a variety of interpretations. Some of these sources may have actually been influenced by Greek notions of the phoenix, rather than the other way around.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 14\u201325}}\n\n==Appearance==\nThe phoenix is sometimes pictured in ancient and medieval literature and medieval art as endowed with a [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]], which emphasizes the bird's connection with the Sun.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} In the oldest images of phoenixes on record these nimbuses often have seven rays, like [[Helios]] (the Greek personification of the Sun).{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 246\u2013247}} Pliny the Elder<ref>''Ancient Magic and the Supernatural in the Modern Visual and Performing Arts'', edited by Filippo Carl\u00e0-Uhink, Irene Berti, 2016, page 172</ref> also describes the bird as having a crest of feathers on its head,<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D10%3Achapter%3D2 10.2]</ref>{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} and [[Ezekiel the Tragedian|Ezekiel the Dramatist]] compared it to a rooster.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}}\n\nAlthough the phoenix was generally believed to be colorful and vibrant, sources provide no clear consensus about its coloration. [[Tacitus]] says that its color made it stand out from all other birds.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 253}} Some said that the bird had peacock-like coloring, and [[Herodotus]]'s claim of the Phoenix being red and yellow is popular in many versions of the story on record.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 259}} Ezekiel the Dramatist declared that the phoenix had red legs and striking yellow eyes,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}} but [[Lactantius]] said that its eyes were blue like sapphires{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 256}} and that its legs were covered in yellow-gold scales with rose-colored talons.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 257\u2013258}}\n\nHerodotus, Pliny, [[Solinus]], and [[Philostratus]] describe the phoenix as similar in size to an eagle,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 251}} but Lactantius and Ezekiel the Dramatist both claim that the phoenix was larger, with Lactantius declaring that it was even larger than an ostrich.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 252}}\n\n==In Gnostic texts==\nIdeas taking the phoenix into consideration presented themselves in the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] manuscript [[On the Origin of the World]] from the [[Nag Hammadi Library]] collection:\n\n{{quote|Thus when [[Eve#Gnosticism|Sophia Zoe]] saw that the rulers of darkness had laid a curse upon her counterparts, she was indignant. And coming out of the first heaven with full power, she chased those rulers out of their heavens and cast them into the sinful world, so that there they should dwell, in the form of evil spirits upon the earth.\n[...], so that in their world it might pass the thousand years in paradise - a soul-endowed living creature called \"phoenix\". It kills itself and brings itself back to life as a witness to the judgement against them, for they did wrong to [[Adam]] and his race, unto the consummation of the age. There are [...] three men, and also his posterities, unto the consummation of the world: the spirit-endowed of eternity, and the soul-endowed, and the earthly. Likewise, there are three phoenixes in paradise - the first is immortal, the second lives 1,000 years; as for the third, it is written in the sacred book that it is consumed. So, too, there are three baptisms - the first is spiritual, the second is by fire, the third is by water. Just as the phoenix appears as a witness concerning the [[angel|angels]], so the case of the water hydri in Egypt, which has been a witness to those going down into the baptism of a true man. The two bulls in Egypt posses a mystery, the Sun and the Moon, being a witness to [[Archon (Gnosticism)#Naming and associations|Sabaoth]]: namely, that over them [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] received the universe; from the day that she made the Sun and Moon, she put a seal upon her heaven, unto eternity. And the worm that has been born out of the phoenix is a human being as well. It is written concerning it, \"the just man will blossom like a phoenix\". And the phoenix first appears in a living state, and dies, and rises again, being a sign of what has become apparent at the consummation of the age.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[James M.
