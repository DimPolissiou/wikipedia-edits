A few months before the debut of Super Junior 05, Choi made his first media appearance with bandmate [[Han Geng]] as one of the runway models in a fashion show by Bum Suk.\n\nChoi debuted as part of 12-member rotational project group ''Super Junior 05'' on 6 November 2005 on [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]' music program ''[[Inkigayo|Popular Songs]]'', performing their first single, \"[[Knockout (Triple 8 song)#Super Junior version|Twins (Knock Out)]]\".

However, plans changed and the company declared a halt in forming future Super Junior generations. Following the addition of thirteenth member [[Cho Kyu-hyun|Kyuhyun]], the group dropped the suffix \"05\" and became officially credited as Super Junior. The re-polished group's first CD single \"[[U (Super Junior song)|U]]\" was released on 7 June 2006, which was their most successful single until the release of \"[[Sorry, Sorry (Super Junior song)|Sorry, Sorry]]\" in March 2009, which helped them achieve global success. \n\nIn April 2008, Choi was put into seven-member sub-group [[Super Junior-M]], a [[Mandopop]] subgroup of [[Super Junior]] for the Chinese music industry. They debuted in China at the 8th Annual Music Chart Awards, simultaneously with the release of their first music video, \"[[U (Super Junior song)#Super Junior-M's cover|U]]\" on 8 April 2008.

It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill, or anesthetized patients to facilitate [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] of the lungs, including [[mechanical ventilation]], and to prevent the possibility of [[asphyxia]]tion or airway obstruction.\n\nThe most widely used route is orotracheal, in which an [[tracheal tube|endotracheal tube]] is passed through the mouth and [[larynx|vocal apparatus]] into the trachea. In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal tube is passed through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea. Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the [[cricothyrotomy]] (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the [[tracheotomy]], used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.\n\nBecause it is an [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive]] and uncomfortable [[medical procedure]], intubation is usually performed after administration of [[General anaesthesia|general anesthesia]] and a [[neuromuscular-blocking drug]]. It can, however, be performed in the awake patient with [[local anesthesia|local]] or [[Topical anesthetic|topical anesthesia]] or in an emergency without any anesthesia at all. Intubation is normally facilitated by using a conventional [[laryngoscopy|laryngoscope]], [[fiberscope|flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope]], or [[Laryngoscopy#Video laryngoscope|video laryngoscope]] to identify the [[vocal cords]] and pass the tube between them into the [[trachea]] instead of into the esophagus.  Other devices and techniques may be used alternatively.\n\nAfter the trachea has been intubated, a balloon cuff is typically inflated just above the far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the [[tracheobronchial tree]] from [[pulmonary aspiration|receiving undesirable material]] such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, [[bag valve mask]] device, or a [[Medical ventilator|mechanical ventilator]]. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).\n\nFor centuries, [[tracheotomy]] was considered the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because only a minority of patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century, however, that advances in understanding of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]], as well an appreciation of the [[germ theory of disease]], had improved the outcome of this operation to the point that it could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of [[anesthesia|anesthesiology]], [[Intensive-care medicine|critical care medicine]], [[emergency medicine]], and [[laryngology]].\n\nTracheal intubation can be associated with [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] such as broken teeth or lacerations of the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the [[Human pharynx|upper airway]]. It can also be associated with potentially fatal complications such as [[pulmonary aspiration]] of stomach contents which can result in a severe and sometimes fatal chemical [[Aspiration pneumonia|aspiration pneumonitis]], or unrecognized intubation of the [[esophagus]] which can lead to potentially fatal [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]]. Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation. Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.\n\n==Indications==\nTracheal intubation is [[indication (medicine)|indicated]] in a variety of situations when illness or a medical procedure prevents a person from maintaining a clear airway, breathing, and [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenating]] the blood. In these circumstances, [[Oxygen therapy|oxygen supplementation]] using a [[simple face mask]] is inadequate.\n\n===Depressed level of consciousness===\nPerhaps the most common indication for tracheal intubation is for the placement of a conduit through which [[nitrous oxide]] or [[volatile anaesthetic|volatile anesthetics]] may be administered. [[General anaesthetic|General anesthetic agents]], [[opioid]]s, and neuromuscular-blocking drugs may [[hypoventilation|diminish]] or even [[apnea|abolish]] the [[Control of respiration|respiratory drive]]. Although it is not the only means to maintain a patent airway during general anesthesia, intubation of the trachea provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]<ref name=Ezri2007/> and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.<ref name=AHA2005-III/>\n\nDamage to the brain (such as from a massive [[stroke]], [[non-penetrating head injury]], [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] or [[poison]]ing) may result in a [[Altered level of consciousness|depressed level of consciousness]]. When this becomes severe to the point of [[stupor]] or [[coma]] (defined as a score on the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] of less than 8),<ref name=ATLS2004CH6/> dynamic collapse of the extrinsic [[Larynx#Extrinsic muscles associated with the larynx|muscles of the airway]] can obstruct the airway, impeding the free flow of air into the lungs. Furthermore, protective airway reflexes such as [[cough]]ing and [[swallowing]] may be diminished or absent. Tracheal intubation is often required to restore patency (the relative absence of blockage) of the airway and protect the tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.<ref name=Kabrhel2007/>\n\n===Hypoxemia===\nIntubation may be necessary for a patient with [[hypoxemia|decreased oxygen content]] and [[oxygen saturation]] of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate ([[hypoventilation]]), suspended ([[apnea]]), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently [[diffusion capacity|transfer gasses to the blood]]. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or [[Polytrauma|multiple severe injuries]].<ref name=Ezri2007/> Examples of such conditions include [[Spinal cord injury|cervical spine injury]], [[flail chest|multiple rib fractures]], severe [[pneumonia]], [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS), or near-[[drowning]]. Specifically, intubation is considered if the [[arterial blood gas|arterial]] [[partial pressure]] of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) is less than 60&nbsp;[[Torr|millimeters of mercury]] (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O<sub>2</sub> concentration ([[FiO2|FIO<sub>2</sub>]]) of 50% or greater. In patients with [[Hypercapnia|elevated arterial carbon dioxide]], an arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) greater than 45&nbsp;mm Hg in the setting of [[Acidosis|acidemia]] would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening [[respiratory acidosis]]. Regardless of the laboratory values, these guidelines are always interpreted in the clinical context.<ref name=Holcroft2010/>\n\n===Airway obstruction===\nActual or impending airway obstruction is a common indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a [[foreign body]] becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe [[blunt trauma|blunt]] or [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]] injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by [[edema|swelling]] and an expanding [[hematoma]], or injury to the [[Tracheobronchial injury|larynx, trachea or bronchi]]. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered [[smoke inhalation]] or burns within or near the airway or [[epiglottitis]]. Sustained [[Tonic\u2013clonic seizure|generalized seizure activity]] and [[angioedema]] are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.<ref name=Ezri2007/>\n\n===Manipulation of the airway===\nDiagnostic or therapeutic manipulation of the airway (such as bronchoscopy, [[Laser medicine|laser therapy]] or [[stent]]ing of the [[Bronchus|bronchi]]) may intermittently interfere with the ability to breathe; intubation may be necessary in such situations.<ref name=Kabrhel2007/>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Laryngoscopes===\n{{Main|Laryngoscopy}}\n[[File:Laryngoscopes-Miller blades.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Laryngoscope handles with an assortment of Miller blades|Laryngoscope handles with an assortment of Miller blades (large adult, small adult, child, infant and newborn)]]\n[[File:Macintosh Blades.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Laryngoscope handles with an assortment of Macintosh blades|Laryngoscope handle with an assortment of [[Robert Reynolds Macintosh|Macintosh]] blades (large adult, small adult, child, infant and newborn)]]\n[[File:Intubaci\u00f3n endotraqueal-8.jpg|thumb|Laryngoscopy ]]\nThe vast majority of tracheal intubations involve the use of a [[viewing instrument]] of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable [[blade]]s, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation<ref name=James1950/> of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters.<ref name=Christod2007/> In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if the patient is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if the patient is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.\n\nThe decision to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The [[Robert Reynolds Macintosh|Macintosh]] blade is the most widely used curved laryngoscope blade,<ref name=Scott2009/> while the Miller blade<ref name=Miller1941/> is the most popular style of straight blade.<ref name=Amornyotin/> Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of [[oxygen]]. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by [[Anesthesiologist|anesthetists]] and [[Otolaryngology|otolaryngologists]], most commonly in the [[Operating theater|operating room]].<ref name=Berry2007/>\n\n[[Optical fiber|Fiberoptic]] laryngoscopes have become increasingly available since the 1990s. In contrast to the conventional laryngoscope, these devices allow the laryngoscopist to indirectly view the larynx. This provides a significant advantage in situations where the operator needs to see around an acute bend in order to visualize the glottis, and deal with otherwise difficult intubations. [[Laryngoscopy#Video laryngoscope|Video laryngoscopes]] are specialized fiberoptic laryngoscopes that use a [[Digital electronics|digital]] [[active pixel sensor|video camera sensor]] to allow the operator to view the glottis and larynx on a video monitor.<ref name=Wheeler2007/> Other \"noninvasive\" devices which can be employed to assist in tracheal intubation are the [[laryngeal mask airway]]<ref name=Brain1985/> (used as a conduit for endotracheal tube placement) and the [[Airtraq]].<ref name=Maharaj2007/>\n\n===Stylets===\n[[File:Tracheal tube stylet.JPG|thumb|alt=An endotracheal tube stylet|An endotracheal tube stylet, useful in facilitating orotracheal intubation]]\n\nAn intubating stylet is a malleable metal wire designed to be inserted into the endotracheal tube to make the tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets,<ref name=Hung2007/> such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60\u00b0 blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.<ref name=Agro2003/>\n\nThe Eschmann tracheal tube introducer (also referred to as a \"gum elastic bougie\") is specialized type of stylet used to facilitate difficult intubation.<ref name=Elorbany2004-1/> This flexible device is {{convert|60|cm|0|abbr=on}} in length, 15 [[French catheter scale|French]] (5&nbsp;mm diameter) with a small \"hockey-stick\" angle at the far end. Unlike a traditional intubating stylet, the Eschmann tracheal tube introducer is typically inserted directly into the trachea and then used as a guide over which the endotracheal tube can be passed (in a manner analogous to the [[Seldinger technique]]). As the Eschmann tracheal tube introducer is considerably less rigid than a conventional stylet, this technique is considered to be a relatively atraumatic means of tracheal intubation.<ref name=Armstrong2004/><ref name=Hodzovic2004-evaluation/>\n\nThe tracheal tube exchanger is a hollow [[catheter]], {{convert|56|to|81|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, that can be used for removal and replacement of tracheal tubes without the need for laryngoscopy.<ref name=Hudson2002/> The Cook Airway Exchange Catheter (CAEC) is another example of this type of catheter; this device has a central [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] (hollow channel) through which [[Insufflation (medicine)|oxygen can be administered]].<ref name=Loudermilk1997/> Airway exchange catheters are long hollow catheters which often have connectors for jet ventilation, manual ventilation, or oxygen insufflation.&nbsp; It is also possible to connect the catheter to a capnograph to perform respiratory monitoring.\n\nThe lighted stylet is a device that employs the principle of [[transillumination]] to facilitate blind orotracheal intubation (an intubation technique in which the laryngoscopist does not view the glottis).<ref name=Davis2000/>\n\n===Tracheal tubes {{anchor|Types of tracheal tube}}===\n{{Main|Tracheal tube}}\n[[Image:Sondeintubation.jpg|thumb|alt=a cuffed endotracheal tube|A cuffed endotracheal tube, constructed of [[polyvinyl chloride]]]]\n[[File:Carlens.jpg|thumb|alt=A Carlens double-lumen endotracheal tube|A Carlens double-lumen endotracheal tube, used for [[thoracic surgery|thoracic surgical]] operations such as [[VATS lobectomy]]]]\n\nA tracheal tube is a catheter that is inserted into the trachea for the primary purpose of establishing and maintaining a patent (open and unobstructed) airway. Tracheal tubes are frequently used for [[airway management]] in the settings of general anesthesia, critical care, mechanical ventilation and emergency medicine. Many different types of tracheal tubes are available, suited for different specific applications. An endotracheal tube is a specific type of tracheal tube that is nearly always inserted through the mouth (orotracheal) or nose (nasotracheal). It is a [[breathing]] conduit designed to be placed into the airway of critically injured, ill or anesthetized patients in order to perform mechanical [[positive pressure ventilation]] of the lungs and to prevent the possibility of aspiration or airway obstruction.<ref name=Adair1992/> The endotracheal tube has a fitting designed to be connected to a source of pressurized gas such as oxygen. At the other end is an orifice through which such gases are directed into the lungs and may also include a balloon (referred to as a cuff). The tip of the endotracheal tube is positioned above the [[Carina of trachea|carina]] (before the trachea divides to each lung) and sealed within the trachea so that the lungs can be ventilated equally.<ref name=Adair1992/> A tracheostomy tube is another type of tracheal tube; this {{convert|2|-|3|in|mm|adj=mid|-long}} curved metal or plastic tube is inserted into a tracheostomy [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]] or a cricothyrotomy incision.<ref name=NatCancInst/>\n\nTracheal tubes can be used to ensure the adequate [[gas exchange|exchange]] of oxygen and [[carbon dioxide]], to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air, or to administer other gases such as [[helium]],<ref name=Tobias2009/> [[nitric oxide]],<ref name=Chotigeat2007/> nitrous oxide, [[xenon]],<ref name=Goto2003/> or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as [[desflurane]], [[isoflurane]], or [[sevoflurane]]. They may also be used as a route for administration of certain medications such as [[bronchodilator]]s, [[Inhaled corticosteroid#Inhaled steroids|inhaled corticosteroids]], and drugs used in treating [[cardiac arrest]] such as [[atropine]], [[epinephrine]], [[lidocaine]] and [[vasopressin]].<ref name=AHA2005-III/>\n\nOriginally made from [[Natural rubber|latex rubber]],<ref name=Macewen18800731/> most modern endotracheal tubes today are constructed of [[polyvinyl chloride]]. Tubes constructed of [[silicone rubber]], wire-reinforced silicone rubber or [[stainless steel]] are also available for special applications. For human use, tubes range in size from {{convert|2|to|10.5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in internal diameter. The size is chosen based on the patient's body size, with the smaller sizes being used for infants and children. Most endotracheal tubes have an inflatable cuff to seal the tracheobronchial tree against leakage of respiratory gases and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, blood, secretions and other fluids. Uncuffed tubes are also available, though their use is limited mostly to children (in small children, the [[cricoid cartilage]] is the narrowest portion of the airway and usually provides an adequate seal for mechanical ventilation).<ref name=Wheeler2007/>\n\nIn addition to cuffed or uncuffed, preformed endotracheal tubes are also available. The oral and nasal RAE tubes (named after the inventors Ring, Adair and Elwyn) are the most widely used of the preformed tubes.<ref name=Ring1975/>\n\nThere are a number of different types of [[double-lumen endo-bronchial tube]]s that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels (Carlens, White and Robertshaw tubes). These tubes are typically [[coaxial]], with two separate channels and two separate openings. They incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in the trachea and an endobronchial lumen, the distal tip of which is positioned 1\u20132&nbsp;cm into the right or left mainstem bronchus. There is also the Univent tube, which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated [[endobronchial blocker]]. These tubes enable one to ventilate both lungs, or either lung independently. Single-lung ventilation (allowing the lung on the operative side to collapse) can be useful during [[thoracic surgery]], as it can facilitate the surgeon's view and access to other relevant structures within the [[thoracic cavity]].<ref name=Sheinbaum2007/>\n\nThe \"armored\" endotracheal tubes are cuffed, wire-reinforced silicone rubber tubes. They are much more flexible than polyvinyl chloride tubes, yet they are difficult to compress or kink. This can make them useful for situations in which the trachea is anticipated to remain intubated for a prolonged duration, or if the neck is to remain flexed during surgery. Most armored tubes have a Magill curve, but preformed armored RAE tubes are also available. Another type of endotracheal tube has four small openings just above the inflatable cuff, which can be used for suction of the trachea or administration of intratracheal medications if necessary. Other tubes (such as the Bivona Fome-Cuf tube) are designed specifically for use in laser surgery in and around the airway.<ref name=Rosenblatt2009/>\n\n===Methods to confirm tube placement===\n[[File:ETtubeGoodPosition.png|thumb|An endotracheal tube in good position on CXR. Arrow marks the tip.]]\n[[File:ETtubeToHigh.png|thumb|An endotracheal tube not deep enough. Arrow marks the tip.]]\n\nNo single method for confirming tracheal tube placement has been shown to be 100% reliable. Accordingly, the use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be the [[Standard of care#Medical standard of care|standard of care]].<ref name=Stone2000/> Such methods include direct visualization as the tip of the tube passes through the glottis, or indirect visualization of the tracheal tube within the trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope. With a properly positioned tracheal tube, equal bilateral [[Respiratory sounds|breath sounds]] will be heard upon [[auscultation|listening to]] the chest with a stethoscope, and no sound upon listening to the area [[epigastrium|over the stomach]]. Equal bilateral rise and fall of the chest wall will be evident with ventilatory excursions. A small amount of [[water vapor]] will also be evident within the lumen of the tube with each exhalation and there will be no gastric contents in the tracheal tube at any time.<ref name=Rosenblatt2009/>\n\nIdeally, at least one of the methods utilized for confirming tracheal tube placement will be a [[measuring instrument]]. Waveform [[capnography]] has emerged as the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for the confirmation of tube placement within the trachea. Other methods relying on instruments include the use of a [[Colorimetry|colorimetric]] end-tidal carbon dioxide detector, a self-inflating esophageal bulb, or an esophageal detection device.<ref name=Wolfe1998/> The distal tip of a properly positioned tracheal tube will be located in the mid-trachea, roughly {{convert|2|cm|0|abbr=on}} above the bifurcation of the carina; this can be confirmed by [[chest radiograph|chest x-ray]]. If it is inserted too far into the trachea (beyond the carina), the tip of the tracheal tube is likely to be within the [[right main bronchus]]\u2014a situation often referred to as a \"right mainstem intubation\". In this situation, the left lung may be unable to participate in ventilation, which can lead to [[hypoxemia|decreased oxygen content]] due to [[Ventilation/perfusion ratio|ventilation/perfusion mismatch]].<ref name=Salem2007/>\n\n==Special situations==\n\n===Emergencies===\nTracheal intubation in the emergency setting can be difficult with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or [[secretion]]s in the airway and poor patient cooperation. Because of this, patients with massive facial injury, complete upper airway obstruction, severely diminished ventilation, or profuse upper airway bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic intubation.<ref name=Morris1994/> Fiberoptic intubation under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals.<ref name=Ovassapian1991/> Success rates of only 83\u201387% have been reported using fiberoptic techniques in the emergency department, with significant [[epistaxis|nasal bleeding]] occurring in up to 22% of patients.<ref name=Delaney1988/><ref name=Mlinek1990/> These drawbacks limit the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy somewhat in urgent and emergency situations.<ref name=Caplan2003/><ref name=Hagberg2007/>\n\nPersonnel experienced in direct laryngoscopy are not always immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices have been designed to act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed [[Human pharynx|oropharyngeal]] airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube ([[Combitube]]).<ref name=Foley2000/><ref name=Frass2007/> Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.<ref name=Hung2007/>\n\n====Rapid-sequence induction and intubation====\n[[Image:McCoy Mac Blades.jpg|thumb|400px|alt=Laryngoscopes prepared in an emergency theatre|Laryngoscopes prepared for emergency anaesthesia]]\n{{main|Rapid sequence induction}}\nRapid sequence induction and intubation (RSI) is a particular method of induction of general anesthesia, commonly employed in emergency operations and other situations where patients are assumed to have a full stomach. The objective of RSI is to minimize the possibility of [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]] and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during the induction of general anesthesia and subsequent tracheal intubation.<ref name=Stone2000/> RSI traditionally involves preoxygenating the lungs with a tightly fitting oxygen mask, followed by the sequential administration of an intravenous [[hypnotic|sleep-inducing]] agent and a rapidly acting neuromuscular-blocking drug, such as [[rocuronium]], [[succinylcholine]], or [[cisatracurium|cisatracurium besilate]], before intubation of the trachea.<ref name=Suresh2007/>\n\nOne important difference between RSI and routine tracheal intubation is that the practitioner does not manually assist the ventilation of the lungs after the onset of general anesthesia and [[apnea|cessation of breathing]], until the trachea has been intubated and the cuff has been inflated. Another key feature of RSI is the application of manual '[[cricoid pressure]]' to the cricoid cartilage, often referred to as the \"Sellick maneuver\", prior to instrumentation of the airway and intubation of the trachea.<ref name=Stone2000/>\n\nNamed for British anesthetist Brian Arthur Sellick (1918\u20131996) who first described the procedure in 1961,<ref name=Sellick1961/> the goal of cricoid pressure is to minimize the possibility of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. Cricoid pressure has been widely used during RSI for nearly fifty years, despite a lack of compelling evidence to support this practice.<ref name=Salem1974/> The initial article by Sellick was based on a small sample size at a time when high [[tidal volume]]s, [[Trendelenburg position|head-down positioning]] and [[barbiturate]] anesthesia were the rule.<ref name=Maltby2002/> Beginning around 2000, a significant body of evidence has accumulated which questions the effectiveness of cricoid pressure. The application of cricoid pressure may in fact displace the esophagus laterally<ref name=Smith2003/> instead of compressing it as described by Sellick. Cricoid pressure may also compress the glottis, which can obstruct the view of the laryngoscopist and actually cause a delay in securing the airway.<ref name=Haslam2005/>\n\nCricoid pressure is often confused with the \"BURP\" (Backwards Upwards Rightwards Pressure) maneuver.<ref name=Knill1993/> While both of these involve digital pressure to the anterior aspect (front) of the laryngeal apparatus, the purpose of the latter is to improve the view of the glottis during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, rather than to prevent regurgitation.<ref name=Takahata1997/> Both cricoid pressure and the BURP maneuver have the potential to worsen laryngoscopy.<ref name=\"pmid16713784\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Levitan RM, Kinkle WC, Levin WJ, Everett WW | title = Laryngeal view during laryngoscopy: a randomized trial comparing cricoid pressure, backward-upward-rightward pressure, and bimanual laryngoscopy | journal = Ann Emerg Med | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 548\u201355 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16713784 | doi = 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.01.013 }}</ref>\n\nRSI may also be used in prehospital emergency situations when a patient is conscious but respiratory failure is imminent (such as in extreme trauma). This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics often use RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft is extremely difficult to perform due to environmental factors. The patient will be paralyzed and intubated on the ground before transport by aircraft.\n\n====Cricothyrotomy====\n{{Main|Cricothyrotomy}}\n[[File:Larynx external en.svg|thumb|375px|alt=In cricothyrotomy, the incision or puncture is made through the cricothyroid membrane in between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage|In cricothyrotomy, the incision or puncture is made through the [[Cricothyroid ligament|cricothyroid membrane]] in between the [[thyroid cartilage]] and the [[cricoid cartilage]]]]\n[[File:Kit de Cricothyro\u00efdotomie.JPG|thumb|alt=Cricothyrotomy kit|[[Cricothyrotomy]] kit]]\n\nA cricothyrotomy is an incision made through the skin and [[Cricothyroid ligament|cricothyroid membrane]] to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma.<ref name=Mohan2009/> A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed as a last resort in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.<ref name=Katos2007/>\n\nThe easiest method to perform this technique is the needle cricothyrotomy (also referred to as a [[percutaneous]] dilational cricothyrotomy), in which a large-bore (12\u201314 [[Needle gauge comparison chart|gauge]]) [[Peripheral venous catheter|intravenous catheter]] is used to puncture the cricothyroid membrane.<ref name=Melker2007/> Oxygen can then be administered through this catheter via [[Jet ventilation|jet insufflation]]. However, while needle cricothyrotomy may be life-saving in extreme circumstances, this technique is only intended to be a temporizing measure until a definitive airway can be established.<ref name=ATLS2004CH2/> While needle cricothyrotomy can provide adequate oxygenation, the small diameter of the cricothyrotomy catheter is insufficient for elimination of carbon dioxide (ventilation). After one hour of [[Apnea#Apneic oxygenation|apneic oxygenation]] through a needle cricothyrotomy, one can expect a [[Arterial blood gas|PaCO<sub>2</sub>]] of greater than 250&nbsp;mm Hg and an arterial [[pH]] of less than 6.72, despite an oxygen saturation of 98% or greater.<ref name=Frumin1959/> A more definitive airway can be established by performing a surgical cricothyrotomy, in which a {{convert|5|to|6|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube can be inserted through a larger incision.<ref name=Gibbs2007/>\n\nSeveral manufacturers market prepackaged cricothyrotomy kits, which enable one to use either a wire-guided percutaneous dilational (Seldinger) technique, or the classic surgical technique to insert a polyvinylchloride catheter through the cricothyroid membrane. The kits may be stocked in hospital emergency departments and operating suites, as well as ambulances and other selected [[Emergency medical services|pre-hospital]] settings.<ref name=Benkhadra2008/>\n\n===Tracheotomy===\n{{Main|Tracheotomy}}\n[[Image:Traqueostomia.png|thumb|left|alt=Diagram of a tracheostomy tube in the trachea|Diagram of a [[tracheal tube|tracheostomy tube]] in the trachea:<br>\n1 - [[Vocal folds]]<br>\n2 - [[Thyroid cartilage]]<br>\n3 - [[Cricoid cartilage]]<br>\n4 - [[Tracheal rings]]<br>\n5 - Balloon cuff]]\n\nTracheotomy consists of making an incision on the front of the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting [[Stoma (medicine)|opening]] can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical<ref name=Gibbs2007/> and percutaneous<ref name=Anon2000/> techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]]s (the nerves that control the [[vocal folds|voicebox]]), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired ([[dysphonia]]); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak ([[aphonia]]). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).<ref name=Heffner1989/><ref name=Lee2002/>\n\n===Children===\n[[File:Premature infant with ventilator.jpg|thumb|alt=A premature infant, intubated and requiring mechanical ventilation|A [[Preterm birth|premature infant]] weighing 990&nbsp;grams (35&nbsp;ounces), intubated and requiring [[mechanical ventilation]] in the [[neonatal intensive-care unit]]]]\n\nThere are significant differences in airway anatomy and respiratory physiology between children and adults, and these are taken into careful consideration before performing tracheal intubation of any [[pediatrics|pediatric]] patient. The differences, which are quite significant in infants, gradually disappear as the human body approaches a mature age and [[body mass index]].<ref name=Cravero2009/>\n\nFor infants and young children, orotracheal intubation is easier than the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of [[pharyngeal tonsil|adenoids]] and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, there are a number of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children.<ref name=Borland1990/><ref name=Theroux1995/><ref name=Kim2008/><ref name=Hackell2009/> Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.<ref name=Rabb2007/>\n\nBecause the airway of a child is narrow, a small amount of glottic or tracheal [[edema|swelling]] can produce critical obstruction. Inserting a tube that is too large relative to the diameter of the trachea can cause swelling. Conversely, inserting a tube that is too small can result in inability to achieve effective positive pressure ventilation due to retrograde escape of gas through the glottis and out the mouth and nose (often referred to as a \"leak\" around the tube). An excessive leak can usually be corrected by inserting a larger tube or a cuffed tube.<ref name=Sheridan2006/>\n\nThe tip of a correctly positioned tracheal tube will be in the mid-trachea, between the [[clavicle|collarbones]] on an [[Anteroposterior#Anterior and posterior|anteroposterior]] chest radiograph. The correct diameter of the tube is that which results in a small leak at a pressure of about {{convert|25|cm|0|abbr=on}} of water. The appropriate inner diameter for the endotracheal tube is estimated to be roughly the same diameter as the child's little finger. The appropriate length for the endotracheal tube can be estimated by doubling the distance from the corner of the child's mouth to the [[ear canal]]. For [[Preterm birth|premature infants]] {{convert|2.5|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} internal diameter is an appropriate size for the tracheal tube. For infants of normal [[gestational age]], {{convert|3|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} internal diameter is an appropriate size. For normally nourished children 1&nbsp;year of age and older, two formulae are used to estimate the appropriate diameter and depth for tracheal intubation. The internal diameter of the tube in mm is (patient's age in years + 16) / 4, while the appropriate depth of insertion in cm is 12 + (patient's age in years / 2).<ref name=Rosenblatt2009/>\n\n=== Newborns ===\nIn newborns free flow [[oxygen]] used to be recommended during intubation however as there is no evidence of benefit the 2011 [[Neonatal Resuscitation Program|NRP guidelines]] no longer do.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zaichkin|first=J|author2=Weiner, GM |title=Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) 2011: new science, new strategies.|journal=Advances in Neonatal Care|date=February 2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=43\u201351|pmid=21285656|doi=10.1097/ANC.0b013e31820e429f}}</ref>\n\n==Predicting difficulty==\n[[File:Ameloblastoma2.jpg|thumb|alt=A child with a massive ameloblastoma of the mandible|Tracheal intubation is anticipated to be difficult in this child with a massive [[ameloblastoma]]]]\n\nTracheal intubation is not a simple procedure and the consequences of failure are grave. Therefore, the patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand. This involves taking the [[medical history]] of the patient and performing a [[physical examination]], the results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems. The proposed surgical procedure (e.g., surgery involving the head and neck, or [[bariatric surgery]]) may lead one to anticipate difficulties with intubation.<ref name=Stone2000/> Many individuals have unusual airway anatomy, such as those who have limited movement of their neck or jaw, or those who have tumors, deep swelling [[hematoma|due to injury]] or [[angioedema|to allergy]], developmental abnormalities of the jaw, or excess fatty tissue of the face and neck. Using conventional laryngoscopic techniques, intubation of the trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients. This is why all persons performing tracheal intubation must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing the airway. Use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among the preferred techniques in the management of such cases. However, these devices require a different skill set than that employed for conventional laryngoscopy and are expensive to purchase, maintain and repair.<ref name=Rozman2009/>\n\nWhen taking the patient's medical history, the subject is questioned about any significant [[Medical sign|signs]] or [[symptom]]s, such as [[dysphonia|difficulty in speaking]] or [[dyspnea|difficulty in breathing]]. These may suggest obstructing [[lesion]]s in various locations within the upper airway, [[larynx]], or tracheobronchial tree. A history of previous surgery (e.g., previous [[Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion|cervical fusion]]), injury, [[radiation therapy]], or [[tumor]]s involving the head, neck and [[mediastinum|upper chest]] can also provide clues to a potentially difficult intubation. Previous experiences with tracheal intubation, especially difficult intubation, intubation for prolonged duration (e.g., intensive care unit) or prior tracheotomy are also noted.<ref name=Stone2000/>\n\nA detailed [[physical examination]] of the airway is important, particularly:<ref name=Reed2007/>\n*the range of motion of the [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical spine]]: the subject should be able to tilt the head back and then forward so that the chin touches the chest.\n*the range of motion of the jaw (the [[temporomandibular joint]]): three of the subject's fingers should be able to fit between the upper and lower incisors.\n*the size and shape of the [[maxilla|upper jaw]] and [[Human mandible|lower jaw]], looking especially for problems such as [[maxillary hypoplasia]] (an underdeveloped upper jaw), [[Micrognathism|micrognathia]] (an abnormally small jaw), or [[Retrognathism|retrognathia]] (misalignment of the upper and lower jaw).\n*the [[thyromental distance]]: three of the subject's fingers should be able to fit between the [[thyroid cartilage|Adam's apple]] and the chin.\n*the size and shape of the tongue and [[palate]] relative to the size of the mouth.\n*the teeth, especially noting the presence of prominent maxillary incisors, any loose or damaged teeth, or [[Crown (dentistry)|crowns]].\n\nMany classification systems have been developed in an effort to predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the [[Cormack-Lehane classification system]],<ref name=Zadrobilek2009/> the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS),<ref name=Adnet1997/> and the [[Mallampati score]].<ref name=Mallampati1985/> The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the [[Posterior tongue|base of the tongue]] influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of [[palatine uvula]], [[Fauces (anatomy)|faucial pillars]] and the [[soft palate]]. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate.<ref name=Shiga2005/><ref name=Gonzalez2008/> Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack\u2013Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack\u2013Lehane classification system.<ref name=Krage2010/> Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation.<ref name=Levitan2004-article/> A recent Cochrane systematic review examined the sensitivity and specificity of various bedside tests commonly used for predicting difficulty in airway management.<ref name=\"Roth2018\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Roth D, Pace NL, Lee A, Hovhannisyan K, Warenits AM, Arrich J, Herkner H | title = Airway physical examination tests for detection of difficult airway management in apparently normal adult patients | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = CD008874 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29761867 | pmc = 6404686 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2 }}</ref> In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.<ref name=Levitan2004-book/>\n\n==Complications==\nTracheal intubation is generally considered the best method for airway management under a wide variety of circumstances, as it provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.<ref name=AHA2005-III/> However, tracheal intubation requires a great deal of clinical experience to master<ref name=Goedecke2007/> and serious complications may result even when properly performed.<ref name=Georgi2007/>\n\nFour anatomic features must be present for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full range of motion of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining the [[hypopharynx|back of the mouth]]), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.<ref name=Georgi2007/>\n\nMinor complications are common after laryngoscopy and insertion of an orotracheal tube. These are typically of short duration, such as sore throat, lacerations of the lips or [[gingiva|gums]] or other structures within the upper airway, chipped, fractured or dislodged teeth, and nasal injury. Other complications which are common but potentially more serious include [[tachycardia|accelerated]] or [[cardiac dysrhythmia|irregular]] heartbeat, [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], elevated [[intracranial pressure|intracranial]] and [[intraocular pressure|introcular]] pressure, and [[bronchospasm]].<ref name=Georgi2007/>\n\nMore serious complications include [[laryngospasm]], [[tracheobronchial injury|perforation of the trachea]] or [[esophagus]], pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents or other foreign bodies, fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine, [[temporomandibular joint]] or [[arytenoid cartilage]]s, decreased oxygen content, [[Hypercapnia|elevated arterial carbon dioxide]], and [[vocal cord paresis|vocal cord weakness]].<ref name=Georgi2007/> In addition to these complications, tracheal intubation via the nasal route carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and potentially severe nasal bleeding.<ref name=Delaney1988/><ref name=Mlinek1990/> Newer technologies such as flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy have fared better in reducing the incidence of some of these complications, though the most frequent cause of intubation trauma remains a lack of skill on the part of the laryngoscopist.<ref name=Georgi2007/>\n\nComplications may also be severe and long-lasting or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and [[retropharyngeal abscess]], bronchial intubation, or nerve injury.

For example, among [[paramedic]]s in several United States urban communities, unrecognized esophageal or [[hypopharynx|hypopharyngeal]] intubation has been reported to be 6%<ref name=Jones2004/><ref name=Pelucio1997/> to 25%.<ref name=Katz2001/> Although not common, where basic [[emergency medical technician]]s are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%.<ref name=Sayre1998/> In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in the emergency room.<ref name=Katz2001/> Because of this, recent editions of the [[American Heart Association]]'s ''Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation'' have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the laryngeal mask airway and the Combitube.<ref name=AHA2005-III/>  However, recent higher quality studies have shown no survival or neurological benefit with endotracheal intubation over supraglottic airway devices (Laryngeal mask or Combitube).<ref name=\"pmid30293843\">{{cite journal | vauthors = White L, Melhuish T, Holyoak R, Ryan T, Kempton H, Vlok R | title = Advanced airway management in out of hospital cardiac arrest: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Am J Emerg Med | volume = 36 | issue = 12 | pages = 2298\u20132306 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30293843 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajem.2018.09.045 | url = https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:4f65350/UQ4f65350_OA.pdf }}</ref>\n\nOne complication\u2014unintentional and unrecognized intubation of the esophagus\u2014is both common (as frequent as 25% in the hands of inexperienced personnel)<ref name=Katz2001/> and likely to result in a deleterious or even fatal outcome. In such cases, oxygen is inadvertently administered to the stomach, from where it cannot be taken up by the [[circulatory system]], instead of the lungs. If this situation is not immediately identified and corrected, death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia.\n\nOf 4,460 claims in the [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] (ASA) Closed Claims Project database, 266 (approximately 6%) were for airway injury. Of these 266 cases, 87% of the injuries were temporary, 5% were permanent or disabling, and 8% resulted in death. Difficult intubation, age older than 60 years, and female gender were associated with claims for perforation of the esophagus or pharynx. Early signs of perforation were present in only 51% of perforation claims, whereas late [[sequelae]] occurred in 65%.<ref name=Domino1999/>\n\n==Alternatives==\nAlthough it offers the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration, tracheal intubation is not the only means to maintain a patent airway. Alternative techniques for airway management and delivery of oxygen, volatile anesthetics or other [[breathing gas]]es include the [[laryngeal mask airway]], i-gel, cuffed oropharyngeal airway, [[positive airway pressure|continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP mask), nasal [[Positive airway pressure#Bi-level pressure devices|BiPAP]] mask, simple face mask, and nasal cannula.<ref name=McGee2007/>\n\nGeneral anesthesia is often administered without tracheal intubation in selected cases where the procedure is brief in duration, or procedures where the depth of anesthesia is not sufficient to cause significant compromise in ventilatory function. Even for longer duration or more invasive procedures, a general anesthetic may be administered without intubating the trachea, provided that patients are carefully selected, and the [[Risk-benefit analysis|risk-benefit ratio]] is favorable (i.e., the risks associated with an unprotected airway are believed to be less than the risks of intubating the trachea).<ref name=McGee2007/>\n\nAirway management can be classified into closed or open techniques depending on the system of ventilation used. Tracheal intubation is a typical example of a closed technique as ventilation occurs using a closed circuit. Several open techniques exist, such as spontaneous ventilation, apnoeic ventilation or jet ventilation. Each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages which determine when it should be used.\n\nSpontaneous ventilation has been traditionally performed with an inhalational agent (i.e. gas induction or inhalational induction using halothane or sevoflurane) however it can also be performed using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol, ketamine or dexmedetomidine). SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is an open airway technique that uses an upwards titration of propofol which maintains ventilation at deep levels of anaesthesia. It has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Booth|first=A. W. G.|last2=Vidhani|first2=K.|last3=Lee|first3=P.

It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill, or anesthetized patients to facilitate [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] of the lungs, including [[mechanical ventilation]], and to prevent the possibility of [[asphyxia]]tion or airway obstruction.\n\nThe most widely used route is orotracheal, in which an [[tracheal tube|endotracheal tube]] is passed through the mouth and [[larynx|vocal apparatus]] into the trachea. In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal tube is passed through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea. Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the [[cricothyrotomy]] (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the [[tracheotomy]], used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.\n\nBecause it is an [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive]] and uncomfortable [[medical procedure]], intubation is usually performed after administration of [[General anaesthesia|general anesthesia]] and a [[neuromuscular-blocking drug]]. It can, however, be performed in the awake patient with [[local anesthesia|local]] or [[Topical anesthetic|topical anesthesia]] or in an emergency without any anesthesia at all. Intubation is normally facilitated by using a conventional [[laryngoscopy|laryngoscope]], [[fiberscope|flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope]], or [[Laryngoscopy#Video laryngoscope|video laryngoscope]] to identify the [[vocal cords]] and pass the tube between them into the [[trachea]] instead of into the esophagus.  Other devices and techniques may be used alternatively.\n\nAfter the trachea has been intubated, a balloon cuff is typically inflated just above the far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the [[tracheobronchial tree]] from [[pulmonary aspiration|receiving undesirable material]] such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, [[bag valve mask]] device, or a [[Medical ventilator|mechanical ventilator]]. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).\n\nFor centuries, [[tracheotomy]] was considered the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because only a minority of patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]], as well an appreciation of the [[germ theory of disease]], had improved the outcome of this operation to the point that it could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in [[endoscopy|endoscopic]] instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of [[anesthesia|anesthesiology]], [[Intensive-care medicine|critical care medicine]], [[emergency medicine]], and [[laryngology]].\n\nTracheal intubation can be associated with [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] such as broken teeth or lacerations of the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the [[Human pharynx|upper airway]]. It can also be associated with potentially fatal complications such as [[pulmonary aspiration]] of stomach contents which can result in a severe and sometimes fatal chemical [[Aspiration pneumonia|aspiration pneumonitis]], or unrecognized intubation of the [[esophagus]] which can lead to potentially fatal [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]]. Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation. Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.\n\n==Indications==\nTracheal intubation is [[indication (medicine)|indicated]] in a variety of situations when illness or a medical procedure prevents a person from maintaining a clear airway, breathing, and [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenating]] the blood. In these circumstances, [[Oxygen therapy|oxygen supplementation]] using a [[simple face mask]] is inadequate.\n\n===Depressed level of consciousness===\nPerhaps the most common indication for tracheal intubation is for the placement of a conduit through which [[nitrous oxide]] or [[volatile anaesthetic|volatile anesthetics]] may be administered. [[General anaesthetic|General anesthetic agents]], [[opioid]]s, and neuromuscular-blocking drugs may [[hypoventilation|diminish]] or even [[apnea|abolish]] the [[Control of respiration|respiratory drive]]. Although it is not the only means to maintain a patent airway during general anesthesia, intubation of the trachea provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]<ref name=Ezri2007/> and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.<ref name=AHA2005-III/>\n\nDamage to the brain (such as from a massive [[stroke]], [[non-penetrating head injury]], [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] or [[poison]]ing) may result in a [[Altered level of consciousness|depressed level of consciousness]]. When this becomes severe to the point of [[stupor]] or [[coma]] (defined as a score on the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] of less than 8),<ref name=ATLS2004CH6/> dynamic collapse of the extrinsic [[Larynx#Extrinsic muscles associated with the larynx|muscles of the airway]] can obstruct the airway, impeding the free flow of air into the lungs. Furthermore, protective airway reflexes such as [[cough]]ing and [[swallowing]] may be diminished or absent. Tracheal intubation is often required to restore patency (the relative absence of blockage) of the airway and protect the tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.<ref name=Kabrhel2007/>\n\n===Hypoxemia===\nIntubation may be necessary for a patient with [[hypoxemia|decreased oxygen content]] and [[oxygen saturation]] of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate ([[hypoventilation]]), suspended ([[apnea]]), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently [[diffusion capacity|transfer gasses to the blood]]. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or [[Polytrauma|multiple severe injuries]].<ref name=Ezri2007/> Examples of such conditions include [[Spinal cord injury|cervical spine injury]], [[flail chest|multiple rib fractures]], severe [[pneumonia]], [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS), or near-[[drowning]]. Specifically, intubation is considered if the [[arterial blood gas|arterial]] [[partial pressure]] of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) is less than 60&nbsp;[[Torr|millimeters of mercury]] (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O<sub>2</sub> concentration ([[FiO2|FIO<sub>2</sub>]]) of 50% or greater. In patients with [[Hypercapnia|elevated arterial carbon dioxide]], an arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) greater than 45&nbsp;mm Hg in the setting of [[Acidosis|acidemia]] would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening [[respiratory acidosis]]. Regardless of the laboratory values, these guidelines are always interpreted in the clinical context.<ref name=Holcroft2010/>\n\n===Airway obstruction===\nActual or impending airway obstruction is a common indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a [[foreign body]] becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe [[blunt trauma|blunt]] or [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]] injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by [[edema|swelling]] and an expanding [[hematoma]], or injury to the [[Tracheobronchial injury|larynx, trachea or bronchi]]. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered [[smoke inhalation]] or burns within or near the airway or [[epiglottitis]]. Sustained [[Tonic\u2013clonic seizure|generalized seizure activity]] and [[angioedema]] are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.<ref name=Ezri2007/>\n\n===Manipulation of the airway===\nDiagnostic or therapeutic manipulation of the airway (such as bronchoscopy, [[Laser medicine|laser therapy]] or [[stent]]ing of the [[Bronchus|bronchi]]) may intermittently interfere with the ability to breathe; intubation may be necessary in such situations.<ref name=Kabrhel2007/>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n===Laryngoscopes===\n{{Main|Laryngoscopy}}\n[[File:Laryngoscopes-Miller blades.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Laryngoscope handles with an assortment of Miller blades|Laryngoscope handles with an assortment of Miller blades (large adult, small adult, child, infant and newborn)]]\n[[File:Macintosh Blades.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Laryngoscope handles with an assortment of Macintosh blades|Laryngoscope handle with an assortment of [[Robert Reynolds Macintosh|Macintosh]] blades (large adult, small adult, child, infant and newborn)]]\n[[File:Intubaci\u00f3n endotraqueal-8.jpg|thumb|Laryngoscopy ]]\nThe vast majority of tracheal intubations involve the use of a [[viewing instrument]] of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable [[blade]]s, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation<ref name=James1950/> of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters.<ref name=Christod2007/> In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if the patient is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if the patient is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.\n\nThe decision to use a straight or curved laryngoscope blade depends partly on the specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The [[Robert Reynolds Macintosh|Macintosh]] blade is the most widely used curved laryngoscope blade,<ref name=Scott2009/> while the Miller blade<ref name=Miller1941/> is the most popular style of straight blade.<ref name=Amornyotin/> Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of [[oxygen]]. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by [[Anesthesiologist|anesthetists]] and [[Otolaryngology|otolaryngologists]], most commonly in the [[Operating theater|operating room]].<ref name=Berry2007/>\n\n[[Optical fiber|Fiberoptic]] laryngoscopes have become increasingly available since the 1990s. In contrast to the conventional laryngoscope, these devices allow the laryngoscopist to indirectly view the larynx. This provides a significant advantage in situations where the operator needs to see around an acute bend in order to visualize the glottis, and deal with otherwise difficult intubations. [[Laryngoscopy#Video laryngoscope|Video laryngoscopes]] are specialized fiberoptic laryngoscopes that use a [[Digital electronics|digital]] [[active pixel sensor|video camera sensor]] to allow the operator to view the glottis and larynx on a video monitor.<ref name=Wheeler2007/> Other \"noninvasive\" devices which can be employed to assist in tracheal intubation are the [[laryngeal mask airway]]<ref name=Brain1985/> (used as a conduit for endotracheal tube placement) and the [[Airtraq]].<ref name=Maharaj2007/>\n\n===Stylets===\n[[File:Tracheal tube stylet.JPG|thumb|alt=An endotracheal tube stylet|An endotracheal tube stylet, useful in facilitating orotracheal intubation]]\n\nAn intubating stylet is a malleable metal wire designed to be inserted into the endotracheal tube to make the tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets,<ref name=Hung2007/> such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60\u00b0 blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.<ref name=Agro2003/>\n\nThe Eschmann tracheal tube introducer (also referred to as a \"gum elastic bougie\") is specialized type of stylet used to facilitate difficult intubation.<ref name=Elorbany2004-1/> This flexible device is {{convert|60|cm|0|abbr=on}} in length, 15 [[French catheter scale|French]] (5&nbsp;mm diameter) with a small \"hockey-stick\" angle at the far end. Unlike a traditional intubating stylet, the Eschmann tracheal tube introducer is typically inserted directly into the trachea and then used as a guide over which the endotracheal tube can be passed (in a manner analogous to the [[Seldinger technique]]). As the Eschmann tracheal tube introducer is considerably less rigid than a conventional stylet, this technique is considered to be a relatively atraumatic means of tracheal intubation.<ref name=Armstrong2004/><ref name=Hodzovic2004-evaluation/>\n\nThe tracheal tube exchanger is a hollow [[catheter]], {{convert|56|to|81|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, that can be used for removal and replacement of tracheal tubes without the need for laryngoscopy.<ref name=Hudson2002/> The Cook Airway Exchange Catheter (CAEC) is another example of this type of catheter; this device has a central [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] (hollow channel) through which [[Insufflation (medicine)|oxygen can be administered]].<ref name=Loudermilk1997/> Airway exchange catheters are long hollow catheters which often have connectors for jet ventilation, manual ventilation, or oxygen insufflation.&nbsp; It is also possible to connect the catheter to a capnograph to perform respiratory monitoring.\n\nThe lighted stylet is a device that employs the principle of [[transillumination]] to facilitate blind orotracheal intubation (an intubation technique in which the laryngoscopist does not view the glottis).<ref name=Davis2000/>\n\n===Tracheal tubes {{anchor|Types of tracheal tube}}===\n{{Main|Tracheal tube}}\n[[Image:Sondeintubation.jpg|thumb|alt=a cuffed endotracheal tube|A cuffed endotracheal tube, constructed of [[polyvinyl chloride]]]]\n[[File:Carlens.jpg|thumb|alt=A Carlens double-lumen endotracheal tube|A Carlens double-lumen endotracheal tube, used for [[thoracic surgery|thoracic surgical]] operations such as [[VATS lobectomy]]]]\n\nA tracheal tube is a catheter that is inserted into the trachea for the primary purpose of establishing and maintaining a patent (open and unobstructed) airway. Tracheal tubes are frequently used for [[airway management]] in the settings of general anesthesia, critical care, mechanical ventilation and emergency medicine. Many different types of tracheal tubes are available, suited for different specific applications. An endotracheal tube is a specific type of tracheal tube that is nearly always inserted through the mouth (orotracheal) or nose (nasotracheal). It is a [[breathing]] conduit designed to be placed into the airway of critically injured, ill or anesthetized patients in order to perform mechanical [[positive pressure ventilation]] of the lungs and to prevent the possibility of aspiration or airway obstruction.<ref name=Adair1992/> The endotracheal tube has a fitting designed to be connected to a source of pressurized gas such as oxygen. At the other end is an orifice through which such gases are directed into the lungs and may also include a balloon (referred to as a cuff). The tip of the endotracheal tube is positioned above the [[Carina of trachea|carina]] (before the trachea divides to each lung) and sealed within the trachea so that the lungs can be ventilated equally.<ref name=Adair1992/> A tracheostomy tube is another type of tracheal tube; this {{convert|2|-|3|in|mm|adj=mid|-long}} curved metal or plastic tube is inserted into a tracheostomy [[Stoma (medicine)|stoma]] or a cricothyrotomy incision.<ref name=NatCancInst/>\n\nTracheal tubes can be used to ensure the adequate [[gas exchange|exchange]] of oxygen and [[carbon dioxide]], to deliver oxygen in higher concentrations than found in air, or to administer other gases such as [[helium]],<ref name=Tobias2009/> [[nitric oxide]],<ref name=Chotigeat2007/> nitrous oxide, [[xenon]],<ref name=Goto2003/> or certain volatile anesthetic agents such as [[desflurane]], [[isoflurane]], or [[sevoflurane]]. They may also be used as a route for administration of certain medications such as [[bronchodilator]]s, [[Inhaled corticosteroid#Inhaled steroids|inhaled corticosteroids]], and drugs used in treating [[cardiac arrest]] such as [[atropine]], [[epinephrine]], [[lidocaine]] and [[vasopressin]].<ref name=AHA2005-III/>\n\nOriginally made from [[Natural rubber|latex rubber]],<ref name=Macewen18800731/> most modern endotracheal tubes today are constructed of [[polyvinyl chloride]]. Tubes constructed of [[silicone rubber]], wire-reinforced silicone rubber or [[stainless steel]] are also available for special applications. For human use, tubes range in size from {{convert|2|to|10.5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in internal diameter. The size is chosen based on the patient's body size, with the smaller sizes being used for infants and children. Most endotracheal tubes have an inflatable cuff to seal the tracheobronchial tree against leakage of respiratory gases and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, blood, secretions and other fluids. Uncuffed tubes are also available, though their use is limited mostly to children (in small children, the [[cricoid cartilage]] is the narrowest portion of the airway and usually provides an adequate seal for mechanical ventilation).<ref name=Wheeler2007/>\n\nIn addition to cuffed or uncuffed, preformed endotracheal tubes are also available. The oral and nasal RAE tubes (named after the inventors Ring, Adair and Elwyn) are the most widely used of the preformed tubes.<ref name=Ring1975/>\n\nThere are a number of different types of [[double-lumen endo-bronchial tube]]s that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels (Carlens, White and Robertshaw tubes). These tubes are typically [[coaxial]], with two separate channels and two separate openings. They incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in the trachea and an endobronchial lumen, the distal tip of which is positioned 1\u20132&nbsp;cm into the right or left mainstem bronchus. There is also the Univent tube, which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated [[endobronchial blocker]]. These tubes enable one to ventilate both lungs, or either lung independently. Single-lung ventilation (allowing the lung on the operative side to collapse) can be useful during [[thoracic surgery]], as it can facilitate the surgeon's view and access to other relevant structures within the [[thoracic cavity]].<ref name=Sheinbaum2007/>\n\nThe \"armored\" endotracheal tubes are cuffed, wire-reinforced silicone rubber tubes. They are much more flexible than polyvinyl chloride tubes, yet they are difficult to compress or kink. This can make them useful for situations in which the trachea is anticipated to remain intubated for a prolonged duration, or if the neck is to remain flexed during surgery. Most armored tubes have a Magill curve, but preformed armored RAE tubes are also available. Another type of endotracheal tube has four small openings just above the inflatable cuff, which can be used for suction of the trachea or administration of intratracheal medications if necessary. Other tubes (such as the Bivona Fome-Cuf tube) are designed specifically for use in laser surgery in and around the airway.<ref name=Rosenblatt2009/>\n\n===Methods to confirm tube placement===\n[[File:ETtubeGoodPosition.png|thumb|An endotracheal tube in good position on CXR. Arrow marks the tip.]]\n[[File:ETtubeToHigh.png|thumb|An endotracheal tube not deep enough. Arrow marks the tip.]]\n\nNo single method for confirming tracheal tube placement has been shown to be 100% reliable. Accordingly, the use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be the [[Standard of care#Medical standard of care|standard of care]].<ref name=Stone2000/> Such methods include direct visualization as the tip of the tube passes through the glottis, or indirect visualization of the tracheal tube within the trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope. With a properly positioned tracheal tube, equal bilateral [[Respiratory sounds|breath sounds]] will be heard upon [[auscultation|listening to]] the chest with a stethoscope, and no sound upon listening to the area [[epigastrium|over the stomach]]. Equal bilateral rise and fall of the chest wall will be evident with ventilatory excursions. A small amount of [[water vapor]] will also be evident within the lumen of the tube with each exhalation and there will be no gastric contents in the tracheal tube at any time.<ref name=Rosenblatt2009/>\n\nIdeally, at least one of the methods utilized for confirming tracheal tube placement will be a [[measuring instrument]]. Waveform [[capnography]] has emerged as the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for the confirmation of tube placement within the trachea. Other methods relying on instruments include the use of a [[Colorimetry|colorimetric]] end-tidal carbon dioxide detector, a self-inflating esophageal bulb, or an esophageal detection device.<ref name=Wolfe1998/> The distal tip of a properly positioned tracheal tube will be located in the mid-trachea, roughly {{convert|2|cm|0|abbr=on}} above the bifurcation of the carina; this can be confirmed by [[chest radiograph|chest x-ray]]. If it is inserted too far into the trachea (beyond the carina), the tip of the tracheal tube is likely to be within the [[right main bronchus]]\u2014a situation often referred to as a \"right mainstem intubation\". In this situation, the left lung may be unable to participate in ventilation, which can lead to [[hypoxemia|decreased oxygen content]] due to [[Ventilation/perfusion ratio|ventilation/perfusion mismatch]].<ref name=Salem2007/>\n\n==Special situations==\n\n===Emergencies===\nTracheal intubation in the emergency setting can be difficult with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or [[secretion]]s in the airway and poor patient cooperation. Because of this, patients with massive facial injury, complete upper airway obstruction, severely diminished ventilation, or profuse upper airway bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic intubation.<ref name=Morris1994/> Fiberoptic intubation under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals.<ref name=Ovassapian1991/> Success rates of only 83\u201387% have been reported using fiberoptic techniques in the emergency department, with significant [[epistaxis|nasal bleeding]] occurring in up to 22% of patients.<ref name=Delaney1988/><ref name=Mlinek1990/> These drawbacks limit the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy somewhat in urgent and emergency situations.<ref name=Caplan2003/><ref name=Hagberg2007/>\n\nPersonnel experienced in direct laryngoscopy are not always immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices have been designed to act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed [[Human pharynx|oropharyngeal]] airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube ([[Combitube]]).<ref name=Foley2000/><ref name=Frass2007/> Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.<ref name=Hung2007/>\n\n====Rapid-sequence induction and intubation====\n[[Image:McCoy Mac Blades.jpg|thumb|400px|alt=Laryngoscopes prepared in an emergency theatre|Laryngoscopes prepared for emergency anaesthesia]]\n{{main|Rapid sequence induction}}\nRapid sequence induction and intubation (RSI) is a particular method of induction of general anesthesia, commonly employed in emergency operations and other situations where patients are assumed to have a full stomach. The objective of RSI is to minimize the possibility of [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]] and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during the induction of general anesthesia and subsequent tracheal intubation.<ref name=Stone2000/> RSI traditionally involves preoxygenating the lungs with a tightly fitting oxygen mask, followed by the sequential administration of an intravenous [[hypnotic|sleep-inducing]] agent and a rapidly acting neuromuscular-blocking drug, such as [[rocuronium]], [[succinylcholine]], or [[cisatracurium|cisatracurium besilate]], before intubation of the trachea.<ref name=Suresh2007/>\n\nOne important difference between RSI and routine tracheal intubation is that the practitioner does not manually assist the ventilation of the lungs after the onset of general anesthesia and [[apnea|cessation of breathing]], until the trachea has been intubated and the cuff has been inflated. Another key feature of RSI is the application of manual '[[cricoid pressure]]' to the cricoid cartilage, often referred to as the \"Sellick maneuver\", prior to instrumentation of the airway and intubation of the trachea.<ref name=Stone2000/>\n\nNamed for British anesthetist Brian Arthur Sellick (1918\u20131996) who first described the procedure in 1961,<ref name=Sellick1961/> the goal of cricoid pressure is to minimize the possibility of regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. Cricoid pressure has been widely used during RSI for nearly fifty years, despite a lack of compelling evidence to support this practice.<ref name=Salem1974/> The initial article by Sellick was based on a small sample size at a time when high [[tidal volume]]s, [[Trendelenburg position|head-down positioning]] and [[barbiturate]] anesthesia were the rule.<ref name=Maltby2002/> Beginning around 2000, a significant body of evidence has accumulated which questions the effectiveness of cricoid pressure. The application of cricoid pressure may in fact displace the esophagus laterally<ref name=Smith2003/> instead of compressing it as described by Sellick. Cricoid pressure may also compress the glottis, which can obstruct the view of the laryngoscopist and actually cause a delay in securing the airway.<ref name=Haslam2005/>\n\nCricoid pressure is often confused with the \"BURP\" (Backwards Upwards Rightwards Pressure) maneuver.<ref name=Knill1993/> While both of these involve digital pressure to the anterior aspect (front) of the laryngeal apparatus, the purpose of the latter is to improve the view of the glottis during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, rather than to prevent regurgitation.<ref name=Takahata1997/> Both cricoid pressure and the BURP maneuver have the potential to worsen laryngoscopy.<ref name=\"pmid16713784\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Levitan RM, Kinkle WC, Levin WJ, Everett WW | title = Laryngeal view during laryngoscopy: a randomized trial comparing cricoid pressure, backward-upward-rightward pressure, and bimanual laryngoscopy | journal = Ann Emerg Med | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 548\u201355 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16713784 | doi = 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2006.01.013 }}</ref>\n\nRSI may also be used in prehospital emergency situations when a patient is conscious but respiratory failure is imminent (such as in extreme trauma). This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics often use RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft is extremely difficult to perform due to environmental factors. The patient will be paralyzed and intubated on the ground before transport by aircraft.\n\n====Cricothyrotomy====\n{{Main|Cricothyrotomy}}\n[[File:Larynx external en.svg|thumb|375px|alt=In cricothyrotomy, the incision or puncture is made through the cricothyroid membrane in between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage|In cricothyrotomy, the incision or puncture is made through the [[Cricothyroid ligament|cricothyroid membrane]] in between the [[thyroid cartilage]] and the [[cricoid cartilage]]]]\n[[File:Kit de Cricothyro\u00efdotomie.JPG|thumb|alt=Cricothyrotomy kit|[[Cricothyrotomy]] kit]]\n\nA cricothyrotomy is an incision made through the skin and [[Cricothyroid ligament|cricothyroid membrane]] to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma.<ref name=Mohan2009/> A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed as a last resort in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.<ref name=Katos2007/>\n\nThe easiest method to perform this technique is the needle cricothyrotomy (also referred to as a [[percutaneous]] dilational cricothyrotomy), in which a large-bore (12\u201314 [[Needle gauge comparison chart|gauge]]) [[Peripheral venous catheter|intravenous catheter]] is used to puncture the cricothyroid membrane.<ref name=Melker2007/> Oxygen can then be administered through this catheter via [[Jet ventilation|jet insufflation]]. However, while needle cricothyrotomy may be life-saving in extreme circumstances, this technique is only intended to be a temporizing measure until a definitive airway can be established.<ref name=ATLS2004CH2/> While needle cricothyrotomy can provide adequate oxygenation, the small diameter of the cricothyrotomy catheter is insufficient for elimination of carbon dioxide (ventilation). After one hour of [[Apnea#Apneic oxygenation|apneic oxygenation]] through a needle cricothyrotomy, one can expect a [[Arterial blood gas|PaCO<sub>2</sub>]] of greater than 250&nbsp;mm Hg and an arterial [[pH]] of less than 6.72, despite an oxygen saturation of 98% or greater.<ref name=Frumin1959/> A more definitive airway can be established by performing a surgical cricothyrotomy, in which a {{convert|5|to|6|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube can be inserted through a larger incision.<ref name=Gibbs2007/>\n\nSeveral manufacturers market prepackaged cricothyrotomy kits, which enable one to use either a wire-guided percutaneous dilational (Seldinger) technique, or the classic surgical technique to insert a polyvinylchloride catheter through the cricothyroid membrane. The kits may be stocked in hospital emergency departments and operating suites, as well as ambulances and other selected [[Emergency medical services|pre-hospital]] settings.<ref name=Benkhadra2008/>\n\n===Tracheotomy===\n{{Main|Tracheotomy}}\n[[Image:Traqueostomia.png|thumb|left|alt=Diagram of a tracheostomy tube in the trachea|Diagram of a [[tracheal tube|tracheostomy tube]] in the trachea:<br>\n1 - [[Vocal folds]]<br>\n2 - [[Thyroid cartilage]]<br>\n3 - [[Cricoid cartilage]]<br>\n4 - [[Tracheal rings]]<br>\n5 - Balloon cuff]]\n\nTracheotomy consists of making an incision on the front of the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting [[Stoma (medicine)|opening]] can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical<ref name=Gibbs2007/> and percutaneous<ref name=Anon2000/> techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the risk of damage to the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]]s (the nerves that control the [[vocal folds|voicebox]]), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired ([[dysphonia]]); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak ([[aphonia]]). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).<ref name=Heffner1989/><ref name=Lee2002/>\n\n===Children===\n[[File:Premature infant with ventilator.jpg|thumb|alt=A premature infant, intubated and requiring mechanical ventilation|A [[Preterm birth|premature infant]] weighing 990&nbsp;grams (35&nbsp;ounces), intubated and requiring [[mechanical ventilation]] in the [[neonatal intensive-care unit]]]]\n\nThere are significant differences in airway anatomy and respiratory physiology between children and adults, and these are taken into careful consideration before performing tracheal intubation of any [[pediatrics|pediatric]] patient. The differences, which are quite significant in infants, gradually disappear as the human body approaches a mature age and [[body mass index]].<ref name=Cravero2009/>\n\nFor infants and young children, orotracheal intubation is easier than the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of [[pharyngeal tonsil|adenoids]] and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, there are a number of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children.<ref name=Borland1990/><ref name=Theroux1995/><ref name=Kim2008/><ref name=Hackell2009/> Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.<ref name=Rabb2007/>\n\nBecause the airway of a child is narrow, a small amount of glottic or tracheal [[edema|swelling]] can produce critical obstruction. Inserting a tube that is too large relative to the diameter of the trachea can cause swelling. Conversely, inserting a tube that is too small can result in inability to achieve effective positive pressure ventilation due to retrograde escape of gas through the glottis and out the mouth and nose (often referred to as a \"leak\" around the tube). An excessive leak can usually be corrected by inserting a larger tube or a cuffed tube.<ref name=Sheridan2006/>\n\nThe tip of a correctly positioned tracheal tube will be in the mid-trachea, between the [[clavicle|collarbones]] on an [[Anteroposterior#Anterior and posterior|anteroposterior]] chest radiograph. The correct diameter of the tube is that which results in a small leak at a pressure of about {{convert|25|cm|0|abbr=on}} of water. The appropriate inner diameter for the endotracheal tube is estimated to be roughly the same diameter as the child's little finger. The appropriate length for the endotracheal tube can be estimated by doubling the distance from the corner of the child's mouth to the [[ear canal]]. For [[Preterm birth|premature infants]] {{convert|2.5|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} internal diameter is an appropriate size for the tracheal tube. For infants of normal [[gestational age]], {{convert|3|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} internal diameter is an appropriate size. For normally nourished children 1&nbsp;year of age and older, two formulae are used to estimate the appropriate diameter and depth for tracheal intubation. The internal diameter of the tube in mm is (patient's age in years + 16) / 4, while the appropriate depth of insertion in cm is 12 + (patient's age in years / 2).<ref name=Rosenblatt2009/>\n\n=== Newborns ===\nIn newborns free flow [[oxygen]] used to be recommended during intubation however as there is no evidence of benefit the 2011 [[Neonatal Resuscitation Program|NRP guidelines]] no longer do.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zaichkin|first=J|author2=Weiner, GM |title=Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) 2011: new science, new strategies.|journal=Advances in Neonatal Care|date=February 2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=43\u201351|pmid=21285656|doi=10.1097/ANC.0b013e31820e429f}}</ref>\n\n==Predicting difficulty==\n[[File:Ameloblastoma2.jpg|thumb|alt=A child with a massive ameloblastoma of the mandible|Tracheal intubation is anticipated to be difficult in this child with a massive [[ameloblastoma]]]]\n\nTracheal intubation is not a simple procedure and the consequences of failure are grave. Therefore, the patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand. This involves taking the [[medical history]] of the patient and performing a [[physical examination]], the results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems. The proposed surgical procedure (e.g., surgery involving the head and neck, or [[bariatric surgery]]) may lead one to anticipate difficulties with intubation.<ref name=Stone2000/> Many individuals have unusual airway anatomy, such as those who have limited movement of their neck or jaw, or those who have tumors, deep swelling [[hematoma|due to injury]] or [[angioedema|to allergy]], developmental abnormalities of the jaw, or excess fatty tissue of the face and neck. Using conventional laryngoscopic techniques, intubation of the trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients. This is why all persons performing tracheal intubation must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing the airway. Use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among the preferred techniques in the management of such cases. However, these devices require a different skill set than that employed for conventional laryngoscopy and are expensive to purchase, maintain and repair.<ref name=Rozman2009/>\n\nWhen taking the patient's medical history, the subject is questioned about any significant [[Medical sign|signs]] or [[symptom]]s, such as [[dysphonia|difficulty in speaking]] or [[dyspnea|difficulty in breathing]]. These may suggest obstructing [[lesion]]s in various locations within the upper airway, [[larynx]], or tracheobronchial tree. A history of previous surgery (e.g., previous [[Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion|cervical fusion]]), injury, [[radiation therapy]], or [[tumor]]s involving the head, neck and [[mediastinum|upper chest]] can also provide clues to a potentially difficult intubation. Previous experiences with tracheal intubation, especially difficult intubation, intubation for prolonged duration (e.g., intensive care unit) or prior tracheotomy are also noted.<ref name=Stone2000/>\n\nA detailed [[physical examination]] of the airway is important, particularly:<ref name=Reed2007/>\n*the range of motion of the [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical spine]]: the subject should be able to tilt the head back and then forward so that the chin touches the chest.\n*the range of motion of the jaw (the [[temporomandibular joint]]): three of the subject's fingers should be able to fit between the upper and lower incisors.\n*the size and shape of the [[maxilla|upper jaw]] and [[Human mandible|lower jaw]], looking especially for problems such as [[maxillary hypoplasia]] (an underdeveloped upper jaw), [[Micrognathism|micrognathia]] (an abnormally small jaw), or [[Retrognathism|retrognathia]] (misalignment of the upper and lower jaw).\n*the [[thyromental distance]]: three of the subject's fingers should be able to fit between the [[thyroid cartilage|Adam's apple]] and the chin.\n*the size and shape of the tongue and [[palate]] relative to the size of the mouth.\n*the teeth, especially noting the presence of prominent maxillary incisors, any loose or damaged teeth, or [[Crown (dentistry)|crowns]].\n\nMany classification systems have been developed in an effort to predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the [[Cormack-Lehane classification system]],<ref name=Zadrobilek2009/> the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS),<ref name=Adnet1997/> and the [[Mallampati score]].<ref name=Mallampati1985/> The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the [[Posterior tongue|base of the tongue]] influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of [[palatine uvula]], [[Fauces (anatomy)|faucial pillars]] and the [[soft palate]]. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate.<ref name=Shiga2005/><ref name=Gonzalez2008/> Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack\u2013Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack\u2013Lehane classification system.<ref name=Krage2010/> Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation.<ref name=Levitan2004-article/> A recent Cochrane systematic review examined the sensitivity and specificity of various bedside tests commonly used for predicting difficulty in airway management.<ref name=\"Roth2018\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Roth D, Pace NL, Lee A, Hovhannisyan K, Warenits AM, Arrich J, Herkner H | title = Airway physical examination tests for detection of difficult airway management in apparently normal adult patients | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = CD008874 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29761867 | pmc = 6404686 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008874.pub2 }}</ref> In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.<ref name=Levitan2004-book/>\n\n==Complications==\nTracheal intubation is generally considered the best method for airway management under a wide variety of circumstances, as it provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.<ref name=AHA2005-III/> However, tracheal intubation requires a great deal of clinical experience to master<ref name=Goedecke2007/> and serious complications may result even when properly performed.<ref name=Georgi2007/>\n\nFour anatomic features must be present for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full range of motion of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining the [[hypopharynx|back of the mouth]]), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.<ref name=Georgi2007/>\n\nMinor complications are common after laryngoscopy and insertion of an orotracheal tube. These are typically of short duration, such as sore throat, lacerations of the lips or [[gingiva|gums]] or other structures within the upper airway, chipped, fractured or dislodged teeth, and nasal injury. Other complications which are common but potentially more serious include [[tachycardia|accelerated]] or [[cardiac dysrhythmia|irregular]] heartbeat, [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], elevated [[intracranial pressure|intracranial]] and [[intraocular pressure|introcular]] pressure, and [[bronchospasm]].<ref name=Georgi2007/>\n\nMore serious complications include [[laryngospasm]], [[tracheobronchial injury|perforation of the trachea]] or [[esophagus]], pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents or other foreign bodies, fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine, [[temporomandibular joint]] or [[arytenoid cartilage]]s, decreased oxygen content, [[Hypercapnia|elevated arterial carbon dioxide]], and [[vocal cord paresis|vocal cord weakness]].<ref name=Georgi2007/> In addition to these complications, tracheal intubation via the nasal route carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and potentially severe nasal bleeding.<ref name=Delaney1988/><ref name=Mlinek1990/> Newer technologies such as flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy have fared better in reducing the incidence of some of these complications, though the most frequent cause of intubation trauma remains a lack of skill on the part of the laryngoscopist.<ref name=Georgi2007/>\n\nComplications may also be severe and long-lasting or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and [[retropharyngeal abscess]], bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure [[pulmonary edema]] (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube.<ref name=Georgi2007/> Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the [[Brachiocephalic artery|innominate artery]] (tracheoinnominate [[fistula]]) or esophagus ([[tracheoesophageal fistula]]). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to [[tracheomalacia|loss of tracheal rigidity]], [[ventilator-associated pneumonia]] and [[Subglottic stenosis|narrowing]] of the glottis or trachea.<ref name=Rosenblatt2009/> The cuff pressure is monitored carefully in order to avoid complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure [[ischemia|restricting the blood supply to]] the tracheal mucosa.<ref name=Sengupta2004/><ref name=Pousman2007/> A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10\u201315% and procedural mortality of 0%,<ref name=Anon2000/> which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands<ref name=Polderman2003/> and the United States.<ref name=Hill1996/>\n\nInability to secure the airway, with subsequent failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to [[hypoxemia|decreased oxygen content]], brain damage, [[Circulatory collapse|cardiovascular collapse]], and death.<ref name=Georgi2007/> When performed improperly, the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal.<ref name=Katz2001/> Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high.<ref name=AHA2005-III/> The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known case in which the patient was improperly intubated and, due to the lack of oxygen, suffered severe brain damage and died.

If this situation is not immediately identified and corrected, death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia.\n\nOf 4,460 claims in the [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] (ASA) Closed Claims Project database, 266 (approximately 6%) were for airway injury. Of these 266 cases, 87% of the injuries were temporary, 5% were permanent or disabling, and 8% resulted in death.

Alternative techniques for airway management and delivery of oxygen, volatile anesthetics or other [[breathing gas]]es include the [[laryngeal mask airway]], i-gel, cuffed oropharyngeal airway, [[positive airway pressure|continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP mask), nasal [[Positive airway pressure#Bi-level pressure devices|BiPAP]] mask, simple face mask, and nasal cannula.<ref name=McGee2007/>\n\nGeneral anesthesia is often administered without tracheal intubation in selected cases where the procedure is brief in duration, or procedures where the depth of anesthesia is not sufficient to cause significant compromise in ventilatory function. Even for longer duration or more invasive procedures, a general anesthetic may be administered without intubating the trachea, provided that patients are carefully selected, and the [[Risk-benefit analysis|risk-benefit ratio]] is favorable (i.e., the risks associated with an unprotected airway are believed to be less than the risks of intubating the trachea).<ref name=McGee2007/>\n\nAirway management can be classified into closed or open techniques depending on the system of ventilation used. Tracheal intubation is a typical example of a closed technique as ventilation occurs using a closed circuit. Several open techniques exist, such as spontaneous ventilation, apnoeic ventilation or jet ventilation. Each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages which determine when it should be used.\n\nSpontaneous ventilation has been traditionally performed with an inhalational agent (i.e. gas induction or inhalational induction using halothane or sevoflurane) however it can also be performed using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol, ketamine or dexmedetomidine). SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is an open airway technique that uses an upwards titration of propofol which maintains ventilation at deep levels of anaesthesia. It has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Booth|first=A. W. G.|last2=Vidhani|first2=K.|last3=Lee|first3=P.

{"title_page": "Oppian", "text_new": "{{hatnote|Not to be confused with the later poet [[Oppian of Apamea]], who also wrote didactic poetry on hunting.}}\n'''Oppian''' ({{lang-grc|\u1f48\u03c0\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2}}, ''Oppian\u00f3s''; {{lang-la|Oppianus}}), also known as '''Oppian of Anazarbus''', '''of Corycus''', or '''of Cilicia''', was a 2nd-century [[Roman Greece|Greco-Roman]] [[Greek poetry|poet]] during the reign of the [[list of Roman emperors|emperors]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Commodus]], who composed the ''Halieutica'', a five-book didactic epic on fishing.\n\n==Biography==\nOppian states that he is from 'the city of Hermes' and the 'city at the promontory of Sarpedon'.<ref>''Halieutica'' 3.9, 3.205-209</ref> This has been supplemented by information from the biographies attached to medieval manuscripts, which state that his birthplace was  Caesarea (now known as [[Anazarbus]]) or Corycus in [[Cilicia]].,<ref>Mair, A.W. 1928. ''Oppian, Colluthus, Tryphiodorus.'', Loeb Classical Liberary, Cambridge (MA), xiii-xv.</ref> or [[Corycus]] according to the [[Suda]]. All these cities were in the [[list of Roman provinces|Roman province]] of [[Cilicia]].\n\nHe composed a [[didactic poem]] in [[ancient Greek language|Greek]] [[hexameter]] on [[fishing]] ({{lang|grc|\u1f09\u03bb\u03b9\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac}}, ''Halieutik\u00e1''). It is about 3500 lines and bears a dedication to [[Marcus Aurelius]] and his son [[Commodus]], placing it to the time of their joint rule (176-180 AD).\n\nA later didactic poem  on [[hunting]], the ''Cynegetica'' ({{lang|grc|\u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03b7\u03b3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac}}, ''Kyn\u0113getik\u00e1''), was also attributed to Oppian. For that reason, its anonymous poet is generally referred to as [[Oppian of Apamea|Pseudo-Oppian]] or Oppian of Apamea.<ref>The most comprehensive study that proves that the ''Cynegetica'' is not by Oppian is Mart\u00ednez, S. and Silva, T. 2003.

The ''Ixeutica'' is now thought to describe a work composed by the Dionysus whom the [[Suda]] mention as the author of a treatise on rocks ({{lang|grc|\u039b\u03b9\u03b8\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac}}, ''Lithiak\u00e1''). A likely explanation for the attribution of all these works to Oppian is that the three didactic poems on hunting, fishing, and fowling were at some point circulated as a complementary trio.<ref>Keydell, R. 1937. ''Oppianos (2)'', in: von Pauly, A.F. et al. (eds), ''Paulys Realencyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft''. Stuttgart, vol. 18, 703-708, p.703-704; James, A.W. 1970. ''Studies in the Language of Oppian of Cilicia'', Amsterdam, p. 2</ref>\n\nAccording to the anonymous biographies attached to the Byzantine manuscripts of the ''Halieutica'', Oppian's father, having incurred the displeasure of a colleague of [[Marcus Aurelius]] named [[Lucius Verus]] by neglecting to pay his respects to him when he visited Rome, was banished to [[Malta]]. Oppian, who had accompanied his father into exile, returned after the death of Verus {{nowrap|({{sc|ad}} 169)}} and presented his poems to Marcus Aurelius, who was so pleased with them that he gave the author a piece of gold for each line, took him into favor, and pardoned his father. Oppian subsequently returned to his native country but died of the plague shortly afterwards at the early age of thirty. His contemporaries erected a statue in his honor, with an inscription which is still extant, containing a lament for his premature death and a eulogy of his precocious genius.\n\n==The ''Halieutica''==\nThe ''Halieutica'' consists of five books, which can be divided into two parts: books 1-2 describe the behaviour of fish and other marine animals, books 3-5 contain various fishing techniques. The content of the ''Halieutica'' is not sufficient to serve as a practical guide for fishing. Instead, the humans and animals described in the work often seem to provide examples of good and bad behaviour. The fish in the ''Halieutica'' are depicted in an anthropomorphic fashion, as their behaviour is generally motivated by emotions such as hate, love, greed, jealousy and friendship. The fish are also very frequently the subject of [[Homeric simile]]s. In many cases, Oppian reverses the Homeric technique: where [[Homer]] compares epic heroes with animals, the actions of animals in the ''Halieutica'' are often compared to all types of human behaviour.<ref>See for instance Kneebone, E. 2008. \"'\u03a4\u039f\u03a3\u03a3' \u0395\u0394\u0391\u0397\u039d: The Poetics of Knowledge in Oppian's ''Halieutica''\", ''Ramus'' 37.1-2, 32-59; Bartley, A.N. 2003.

Untersuchungen zur Typologie des antiken Lehrgedichts''. M\u00fcnchen, p. 137-153</ref>\n\nThe content of the ''Halieutica'' is as follows:\n* Book 1: after the introduction and dedication of the work to [[Marcus Aurelius]], the first half of the work contains a catalogue of marine animal species, sorted by their habitat (''Hal''. 1.80-445). The second half describes their reproductive behaviour (''Hal''. 1.446-797).\n* Book 2: this book describes the 'battles' of fish, how predators catch their prey and techniques that fish use to avoid capture by other fish.\n* Book 3: the book starts with a description of the preparations for fishing (''Hal''. 3.29-91). It then describes how fish escape fishermen (''Hal''. 3.92-168). The main portion of the book contains various techniques to capture fish through their gluttony (''Hal''. 3.169-528), followed by a list of fish that can be caught due to their aggression and ends with tuna fishing (''Hal''. 3.529-648).\n* Book 4: the main theme of this book is fishing through manipulating the love and lust of fish (''Hal''. 4.1-449). The remainder of the book describes, among other things, frightening fish (''Hal''. 4.502-634) and fishing with poison (''Hal''. 4.647-693).\n* Book 5: in many ways grand finale of the ''Halieutica'', as it teaches you how to catch the largest animals of the sea, including whales, sharks, and dolphins. The work is concluded by a section on the fatal outcome of sponge diving.

The second half describes their reproductive behaviour (''Hal''. 1.446-797).\n* Book 2: this book describes the 'battles' of fish, how predators catch their prey and techniques that fish use to avoid capture by other fish.\n* Book 3: the book starts with a description of the preparations for fishing (''Hal''. 3.29-91). It then describes how fish escape fishermen (''Hal''. 3.92-168). The main portion of the book contains various techniques to capture fish through their gluttony (''Hal''. 3.169-528), followed by a list of fish that can be caught due to their aggression and ends with tuna fishing (''Hal''. 3.529-648).\n* Book 4: the main theme of this book is fishing through manipulating the love and lust of fish (''Hal''. 4.1-449). The remainder of the book describes, among other things, frightening fish (''Hal''. 4.502-634) and fishing with poison (''Hal''. 4.647-693).\n* Book 5: in many ways grand finale of the ''Halieutica'', as it teaches you how to catch the largest animals of the sea, including whales, sharks, and dolphins. The work is concluded by a section on the fatal outcome of sponge diving.

Conch is the name locals use to refer to themselves, and it comes from the sea snail that is native to the area and has been economically important to Monroe County.  Conch culture's hallmarks include intimate familiarity with the sea and especially local waters, quirkiness by most mainland standards and an acceptance of alternative lifestyles, anti-authoritarian stances in general, and local knowledge of the geography and weather of the area.\n\nFishing, as an economic activity, and making a living from the sea, are important to conch culture. Sponge-diving, conch diving, crabbing, lobstering and other commercial fishing have been important parts of conch culture.  Commercial fishing is now less important to conch culture than it has been in the past, and recreational fishing is more important, as some conchs now make their livings from charter fishing and other tourism-related businesses.\n\nRegarding government-sponsored organizations, the Florida Keys Council for the Arts is the primary cultural umbrella for the Florida Keys, and serves the population from [[Key Largo]] to [[Key West]]. A [[non-profit]] local arts agency, it makes grants, operates the Monroe County Art in Public Places program, sponsors seminars, and manages the on-line cultural calendar for the region. It also manages the County's Tourism Development Council arts marketing grants and serves as a leading advocate for cultural tourism in lower [[Florida]]. In 1998, the Florida Keys Council of the Arts was designated by the Board of Monroe County Commissioners as the area's Local Arts Agency as provided by Florida Statute 286.011. Established in 1997 as the Monroe Council of the Arts Corporation. The name was changed to the Florida Keys Council of the Arts in 2001. Today the organization is the liaison among cultural organizations, all levels of government and the private sector in encouraging and promoting the arts throughout Monroe County. The council endeavors to make the arts a part of the fabric of daily life. From its inception through fiscal year end 2006, FKCA has awarded $433,916 in privately raised funds and grants to literary, visual and performing artists and cultural organizations. Add to that sum the Cultural Umbrella event funding, the South Florida Cultural Consortium Visual & Media Artists Fellowships and The Art in Public Places commissions, and the total distributed in the Keys cultural community through FKCA's efforts come to $2.5 million to date. The annual economic impact of the non-profit cultural community in the Keys is estimated at over $22 million. The Florida Keys Council of the Arts, a non-profit,501(c) (3) corporation in a public-private partnership with local county government since 1997 serves 76,329 local residents and three million visitors annually. A ten-member board of directors guides the council, assisted by three alternate directors, two directors Emeritus and twenty-five advisory board members.\n\nOther notable Monroe County cultural organizations are the [[Key West Literary Seminar]], [[The Studios of Key West]], the Red Barn Theatre, Key West Symphony, Sculpture Key West, [[Fantasy Fest]], the San Carlos Institute, [[Ernest Hemingway House|Hemingway House and Museum]], [[Old Post Office and Customshouse (Key West, Florida)|Customs House Museum]], and Key West Art and Historical Society.\n\n==Education==\nThe [[Monroe County School District (Florida)|Monroe County School District]] serves the county, as well as several private schools for primary and secondary education.\n\n[[Florida Keys Community College]] is the primary college education provider with main campus in Key West, Florida. FKCC also operates two additional campuses in the Florida Keys; one in Marathon and another in Key Largo.\n\n==Government==\n\n===Elections===\n\nAlthough Monroe County has voted mostly for the Democratic candidate since [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], it is a competitive county in presidential elections; it was won by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] by margins of 5% in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and 0.5% in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]]. [[Barack Obama]] was the first candidate for president to win a majority, 51.7%, of the vote since [[George H. W. Bush]]'s Electoral College-landslide victory in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]]. In 2016 [[Donald Trump]] was the first Republican to carry the county in almost three decades winning 51% of its vote in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 Election]], by an even bigger margin than the 2008 election, which was a very notable shift.\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; margin:1em; font-size:95%;\"\n|+ '''Monroe County vote<br /> by party in presidential elections'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|date=|website=uselectionatlas.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>\n|- style=\"background:lightgrey;\"\n!

Conch is the name locals use to refer to themselves, and it comes from the sea snail that is native to the area and has been economically important to Monroe County.  Conch culture's hallmarks include intimate familiarity with the sea and especially local waters, quirkiness by most mainland standards and an acceptance of alternative lifestyles, anti-authoritarian stances in general, and local knowledge of the geography and weather of the area.\n\nFishing, as an economic activity, and making a living from the sea, are important to conch culture. Sponge-diving, conch diving, crabbing, lobstering and other commercial fishing have been important parts of conch culture.  Commercial fishing is now less important to conch culture than it has been in the past, and recreational fishing is more important, as some conchs now make their livings from charter fishing and other tourism-related businesses.\n\nRegarding government-sponsored organizations, the Florida Keys Council for the Arts is the primary cultural umbrella for the Florida Keys, and serves the population from [[Key Largo]] to [[Key West]]. A [[non-profit]] local arts agency, it makes grants, operates the Monroe County Art in Public Places program, sponsors seminars, and manages the on-line cultural calendar for the region. It also manages the County's Tourism Development Council arts marketing grants and serves as a leading advocate for cultural tourism in lower [[Florida]]. In 1998, the Florida Keys Council of the Arts was designated by the Board of Monroe County Commissioners as the area's Local Arts Agency as provided by Florida Statute 286.011. Established in 1997 as the Monroe Council of the Arts Corporation. The name was changed to the Florida Keys Council of the Arts in 2001. Today the organization is the liaison among cultural organizations, all levels of government and the private sector in encouraging and promoting the arts throughout Monroe County. The council endeavors to make the arts a part of the fabric of daily life. From its inception through fiscal year end 2006, FKCA has awarded $433,916 in privately raised funds and grants to literary, visual and performing artists and cultural organizations. Add to that sum the Cultural Umbrella event funding, the South Florida Cultural Consortium Visual & Media Artists Fellowships and The Art in Public Places commissions, and the total distributed in the Keys cultural community through FKCA's efforts come to $2.5 million to date. The annual economic impact of the non-profit cultural community in the Keys is estimated at over $22 million. The Florida Keys Council of the Arts, a non-profit,501(c) (3) corporation in a public-private partnership with local county government since 1997 serves 76,329 local residents and three million visitors annually. A ten-member board of directors guides the council, assisted by three alternate directors, two directors Emeritus and twenty-five advisory board members.\n\nOther notable Monroe County cultural organizations are the [[Key West Literary Seminar]], [[The Studios of Key West]], the Red Barn Theatre, Key West Symphony, Sculpture Key West, [[Fantasy Fest]], the San Carlos Institute, [[Ernest Hemingway House|Hemingway House and Museum]], [[Old Post Office and Customshouse (Key West, Florida)|Customs House Museum]], and Key West Art and Historical Society.\n\n==Education==\nThe [[Monroe County School District (Florida)|Monroe County School District]] serves the county, as well as several private schools for primary and secondary education.\n\n[[Florida Keys Community College]] is the primary college education provider with main campus in Key West, Florida. FKCC also operates two additional campuses in the Florida Keys; one in Marathon and another in Key Largo.\n\n==Government==\n\n===Elections===\n\nAlthough Monroe County has voted mostly for the Democratic candidate since [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], it is a competitive county in presidential elections; it was won by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] by margins of 5% in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and 0.5% in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]]. [[Barack Obama]] was the first candidate for president to win a majority, 51.7%, of the vote since [[George H. W. Bush]]'s Electoral College-landslide victory in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]]. In 2016 [[Donald Trump]] was the first Republican to carry the county in almost three decades winning 51% of its vote in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 Election]], by an even bigger margin than the 2008 election, which was a very notable shift.\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; margin:1em; font-size:95%;\"\n|+ '''Monroe County vote<br/> by party in presidential elections'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|date=|website=uselectionatlas.org|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>\n|- style=\"background:lightgrey;\"\n!

In the [[Shang Dynasty]] of the 2nd millennium BCE, Chinese thought regarded the Big Dipper as a deity, while during the [[Han Dynasty]], it was considered a ''qi'' path of the circumpolar god, ''Taiyi''.<ref>{{harvp|Little|Eichman|2000| p=128}}</ref>\n\nTaoist temples in southern China and Taiwan may often be identified by their roofs, which feature [[Chinese dragon|dragons]] and [[fenghuang|phoenixes]] made from multi-colored ceramic tiles. They also stand for the harmony of yin and yang (with the phoenix representing yin). A related symbol is the flaming pearl, which may be seen on such roofs between two dragons, as well as on the hairpin of a [[List of Celestial Masters|Celestial Master]].<ref>{{harvp|Schipper|1993|p=21}}</ref> In general though, Chinese Taoist architecture lacks universal features that distinguish it from other structures.<ref>\n{{harvp|Little|Eichman|2000| p=74}}\n</ref>\n\n==Practices==\n\n===Rituals===\n\n[[File:\u4e8c\u738b\u5e99\u5185\u6bbf.jpg|thumb|A hall of worship of the [[Erwang Temple]], a [[Taoist temple]] in [[Dujiangyan City|Dujiangyan]], [[Sichuan]]. There are elements of the ''[[jingxiang]]'' religious practice ([[incense]] and [[candle]] offerings).]]\n\nAt ancient times, before Daoism Religion was founded, food may be set out as a [[sacrifice]] to the spirits of the deceased or the gods. This may include slaughtered animals, such as pigs and ducks, or fruit. The Daoist [[List of Celestial Masters|Celestial Master]] [[Zhang Daoling]] rejected food and animal sacrifices to the Gods. He tore apart temples which demanded animal sacrifice and drove away its priests. Nowadays Daoism Temples are still not allowed to use animal sacrifices.<ref>[[David \"Race\" Bannon]], \u201cChinese Medicine: From Temples to Taoism,\u201d  T\u2019ai Chi,  Vol. 20, No. 3 (1996): 28\u201333.</ref> Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of [[joss paper]], or [[hell money]], on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear\u2014not as a mere image, but as the actual item\u2014in the spirit world, making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved ones. The joss paper is mostly used when memorising ancestors, such as time of [[Qingming Festival|Qingming]].\n\nAlso on particular holidays, street parades take place. These are lively affairs which invariably involve firecrackers and flower-covered floats broadcasting traditional music. They also variously include [[lion dance]]s and [[dragon dance]]s; human-occupied puppets (often of the \"[[Seventh Lord]]\" and \"[[Eighth Lord]]\"), [[Kungfu]]-practicing and [[palanquin]]s carrying god-images.

Since the creation of the People's Republic of China, its government has encouraged a revival of Taoist traditions in codified settings. In 1956, the [[Chinese Taoist Association]] was formed to administer the activities of all registered Taoist orders, and received official approval in 1957. It was disbanded during the [[Cultural Revolution]] under [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], but was re-established in 1980.

Since the creation of the People's Republic of China, its government has encouraged a revival of Taoist traditions in codified settings. In 1956, the [[Chinese Taoist Association]] was formed to administer the activities of all registered Taoist orders, and received official approval in 1957. It was disbanded during the [[Cultural Revolution]] under [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], but was re-established in 1980. The headquarters of the association are at the ''Baiyunguan'', or [[White Cloud Temple]] of [[Beijing]], belonging to the [[Longmen Taoism|Longmen]] branch of Quanzhen Taoism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Taoism/Historical-Development/Modern-Age.html|title=Patheos Library \u2013 Taoism: Modern Age|publisher=Patheos.com|accessdate=16 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115093751/http://www.patheos.com/Library/Taoism/Historical-Development/Modern-Age.html|archive-date=15 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Since 1980, many Taoist monasteries and temples have been reopened or rebuilt, both belonging to the Zhengyi or Quanzhen schools, and clergy [[ordination]] has been resumed.\n\nTaoist literature and art has influenced the cultures of [[Taoism in Korea|Korea]], [[Taoism in Japan|Japan]], and [[Taoism in Vietnam|Vietnam]].

For example, \"to cart\", meaning to transfer to another prison, has been in use in Glasgow since 1733.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA two-year study was done by Bert Little, Ph.D. on American English [[slang]] with the main focus being in the coastal plain region of  the Southeast U.S.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Little|first=Bert|date=Summer 1982|title=Prison Lingo: A Style of American English Slang|jstor=30027838|journal=Anthropological Linguistics|volume=24|pages=206\u2013244}}</ref> His study published by The Trustees of Indiana University on behalf of the ''Anthropological Linguistics'' journal goes on to provide an extensive glossary of common prison slang terms that he found circling through the prison systems.<ref name=\":0\" />  Studies by Alicja Dziedzic-Rawska from the Maria Curie-Sk\u0142odowska University in Poland describe prison slang as \"extremely rich and creative\" with new words being formed on a daily basis.
