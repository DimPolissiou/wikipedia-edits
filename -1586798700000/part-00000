It differs from a [[submersible]], which has more limited underwater capability. It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to [[remotely operated vehicle]]s and [[Autonomous underwater vehicle|robots]], as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels, such as the [[midget submarine]] and the [[wet sub]].

Submarines were first widely used during [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), and are now used in many [[navy|navies]] large and small. Military uses include attacking enemy surface [[ship]]s (merchant and military), or other submarines, [[aircraft carrier]] protection, [[blockade]] running, [[ballistic missile submarine]]s as part of a nuclear strike force, [[reconnaissance]], conventional land attack (for example using a [[cruise missile]]), and covert insertion of [[special forces]]. Civilian uses for submarines include [[marine science]], salvage, exploration and facility inspection and maintenance. Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or [[undersea cable]] repair. Submarines are also used in tourism and [[undersea archaeology]].\n\nMost large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical (or conical) ends and a vertical structure, usually located amidships, which houses communications and sensing devices as well as [[periscope]]s. In modern submarines, this structure is the \"[[Sail (submarine)|sail]]\" in American usage and \"fin\" in European usage. A \"[[conning tower]]\" was a feature of earlier designs: a separate pressure hull above the main body of the [[boat]] that allowed the use of shorter periscopes. There is a propeller (or pump jet) at the rear, and various hydrodynamic control fins. Smaller, deep-diving and specialty submarines may deviate significantly from this traditional layout. Submarines use [[diving plane]]s and also change the amount of water and air in [[ballast tank]]s to change [[buoyancy]] for submerging and surfacing.\n\nSubmarines have one of the widest ranges of types and capabilities of any vessel. They range from small autonomous examples and one- or two-person subs that operate for a few hours to vessels that can remain submerged for six months\u2014such as the Russian {{sclass2-|Typhoon|submarine|4}}, the biggest submarines ever built. Submarines can work at greater depths than are survivable or practical for human [[Underwater diving|divers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Worlds Biggest Submarine|url=http://englishrussia.com/2009/04/14/worlds-biggest-submarine/ |last=Sherman|first=Chris |date=14 April 2009|website=English Russia |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> Modern deep-diving submarines derive from the [[bathyscaphe]], which in turn evolved from the [[diving bell]].\n==History==\n{{Main|History of submarines}}\n\n=== Etymology ===\nWhereas the principal meaning of \"submarine\" is an armed, submersible [[warship]], the more general meaning is for any type of submersible craft.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/submarine |title=submarine |website=Lexico |access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> The definition as of 1899 was for any type of \"submarine boat\".<ref>''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993, Vol. 2 N\u2013Z</ref> By [[naval tradition]], submarines are still usually referred to as \"boats\" rather than as \"ships\", regardless of their size.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ROPWAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=pig+boat |title=Pigboat 39: An American Sub Goes to War |last=Gugliotta |first=Bobette |date=2014-02-17 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=9780813146317 |language=en}}</ref> In other navies with a history of large submarine fleets they are also \"boats\"; in German it is an {{lang|de|Unterseeboot}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unterseebootbau|last=Gabler, Ulrich |date=1997|publisher=Bernard und Graefe|isbn=3763759581|edition=4th |location=Koblenz|oclc=75848309|language=de}}</ref> or {{lang|de|U-Boot}} (under-sea boat)<ref>{{Cite book |title=Uboote im 2.

This era marked a pivotal time in submarine development, and several important technologies appeared. A number of nations built and used submarines. [[Diesel-electric transmission|Diesel electric]] propulsion became the dominant power system and equipment such as the periscope became standardized. Countries conducted many experiments on effective tactics and weapons for submarines, which led to their large impact in [[World War I]].\n\nThe [[Ireland|Irish]] inventor [[John Philip Holland]] built a model submarine in 1876 and a full-scale version in 1878, which were followed by a number of unsuccessful ones. In 1896 he designed the Holland Type VI submarine, which used internal combustion engine power on the surface and electric [[battery (electricity)|battery]] power underwater. Launched on 17 May 1897 at Navy Lt. [[Lewis Nixon (naval architect)|Lewis Nixon]]'s [[Crescent Shipyard]] in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], ''Holland VI'' was purchased by the [[United States Navy]] on 11 April 1900, becoming the Navy's first commissioned submarine, christened {{USS|Holland|SS-1|6}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9040797/John-Philip-Holland |title=John Philip Holland |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nCommissioned in June 1900, the French steam and electric {{ship|French submarine|Narval|Q4|2}} employed the now typical double-hull design, with a pressure hull inside the outer shell. These 200-ton ships had a range of over {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} underwater. The French submarine ''Aigrette'' in 1904 further improved the concept by using a diesel rather than a gasoline engine for surface power. Large numbers of these submarines were built, with seventy-six completed before 1914.\n\nThe Royal Navy commissioned five {{sclass2-|Holland|submarine|2}}s from [[Vickers]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]], under licence from the [[General Dynamics Electric Boat|Holland Torpedo Boat Company]] from 1901 to 1903. Construction of the boats took longer than anticipated, with the first only ready for a diving trial at sea on 6 April 1902. Although the design had been purchased entirely from the US company, the actual design used was an untested improvement to the original Holland design using a new {{convert|180|hp}} petrol engine.<ref>Galantin, Ignatius J., Admiral, USN (Ret.). Foreword to ''Submariner'' by Johnnie Coote, p. 1</ref>\n\nThese types of submarines were first used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u201305. Due to the blockade at [[Port Arthur, China|Port Arthur]], the Russians sent their submarines to [[Vladivostok]], where by 1 January 1905 there were seven boats, enough to create the world's first \"operational submarine fleet\". The new submarine fleet began patrols on 14 February, usually lasting for about 24 hours each. The first confrontation with Japanese warships occurred on 29 April 1905 when the Russian submarine [[Som-class submarine|''Som'']] was fired upon by Japanese torpedo boats, but then withdrew.<ref>Olender p. 175</ref>\n\n====World War I====\n[[File:U9Submarine.jpg|thumb|The German submarine {{SMU|U-9}}, which sank three British [[cruiser]]s in [[Action of 22 September 1914|less than an hour in September 1914]]]]\n\nMilitary submarines first made a significant impact in [[World War I]].

More submersibles than true submarines, U-boats operated primarily on the surface using regular engines, submerging occasionally to attack under battery power.

(Shipping was vital to supply Britain's population with food, industry with raw material, and armed forces with fuel and armaments.) While U-boats destroyed a significant number of ships, the strategy ultimately failed. Although the U-boats had been updated in the interwar years, the major innovation was improved communications, encrypted using the famous [[Enigma machine|Enigma cipher machine]]. This allowed for mass-attack [[naval tactics]] (''Rudeltaktik'', commonly known as \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]\"), but was also ultimately the U-boats' downfall. By the end of the war, almost 3,000 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] ships (175 warships, 2,825 merchantmen) had been sunk by U-boats.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crocker III|first=H.

They also had submarines with the highest submerged speeds during World War II ({{sclass-|I-201|submarine|2}}s) and submarines that could carry multiple aircraft ({{sclass-|I-400|submarine|2}}s). They were also equipped with one of the most advanced torpedoes of the conflict, the oxygen-propelled [[Type 95 torpedo|Type 95]]. Nevertheless, despite their technical prowess, Japan chose to use its submarines for fleet warfare, and consequently were relatively unsuccessful, as warships were fast, maneuverable and well-defended compared to merchant ships.\n\nThe submarine force was the most effective anti-ship weapon in the American arsenal. Submarines, though only about 2 percent of the U.S. Navy, destroyed over 30 percent of the Japanese Navy, including 8 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship and 11 cruisers. US submarines also destroyed over 60 percent of the Japanese merchant fleet, crippling Japan's ability to supply its military forces and industrial war effort. [[Allied submarines in the Pacific War]] destroyed more Japanese shipping<!--because \"shipping\" means \"merchant\", generally, & that's the important factor--> than all other weapons combined. This feat was considerably aided by the Imperial Japanese Navy's failure to provide adequate escort forces for the nation's merchant fleet.\n\nDuring World War II, 314&nbsp;submarines served in the US Navy, of which nearly 260 were deployed to the Pacific.<ref name=\"O'Kane, p. 333\">O'Kane, p. 333</ref> When the Japanese attacked Hawaii in December 1941, 111 boats were in commission; 203 submarines from the {{sclass-|Gato|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Balao|submarine|5}}, and {{sclass-|Tench|submarine|4}}es were commissioned during the war.

Submarines would attack either on the surface, using deck guns or submerged, using [[torpedo]]es. They were particularly effective in sinking Allied transatlantic shipping in both World Wars, and in disrupting Japanese supply routes and naval operations in the Pacific in World War II.\n\n[[Naval mine|Mine]]-laying submarines were developed in the early part of the 20th century. The facility was used in both World Wars. Submarines were also used for inserting and removing covert agents and military forces in [[special operations]], for intelligence gathering, and to rescue aircrew during air attacks on islands, where the airmen would be told of safe places to crash-land so the submarines could rescue them. Submarines could carry cargo through hostile waters or act as supply vessels for other submarines.\n\nSubmarines could usually locate and attack other submarines only on the surface, although {{HMS|Venturer|P68|6}} managed to sink {{GS|U-864||2}} with a four torpedo spread while both were submerged. The British developed a specialized anti-submarine submarine in WWI, the [[British R-class submarine|R class]]. After WWII, with the development of the homing torpedo, better [[sonar]] systems, and [[nuclear propulsion]], submarines also became able to hunt each other effectively.\n\nThe development of [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] and submarine-launched [[cruise missile]]s gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from [[cluster bomb]]s to [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\nThe primary defense of a submarine lies in its ability to remain concealed in the depths of the ocean. Early submarines could be detected by the sound they made. Water is an excellent conductor of sound (much better than air), and submarines can detect and track comparatively noisy surface ships from long distances. Modern submarines are built with an emphasis on [[Stealth technology|stealth]]. Advanced [[propeller]] designs, extensive sound-reducing insulation, and special machinery help a submarine remain as quiet as ambient ocean noise, making them difficult to detect. It takes specialized technology to find and attack modern submarines.\n\n[[Sonar#Active sonar|Active sonar]] uses the reflection of sound emitted from the search equipment to detect submarines. It has been used since WWII by surface ships, submarines and aircraft (via dropped buoys and helicopter \"dipping\" arrays), but it reveals the emitter's position, and is susceptible to counter-measures.\n\nA concealed military submarine is a real threat, and because of its stealth, can force an enemy navy to waste resources searching large areas of ocean and protecting ships against attack. This advantage was vividly demonstrated in the 1982 [[Falklands War]] when the British [[nuclear-powered]] submarine {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}} sank the Argentine cruiser {{ship|ARA|General Belgrano||2}}. After the sinking the Argentine Navy recognized that they had no effective defense against submarine attack, and the Argentine surface fleet withdrew to port for the remainder of the war, though an Argentine submarine remained at sea.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Finlan\n | first = Alastair\n | title = The Royal Navy in the Falklands Conflict and the Gulf War: Culture and Strategy\n | publisher = Psychology Press\n | series = British Politics and Society\n | volume = 15\n | date = 2004\n | location = London\n | pages = 214\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=TmP27lCid8AC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=general+belgrano+naval+strategy#v=onepage&q=general%20belgrano%20naval%20strategy&f=false\n | isbn = 978-0-7146-5479-9 }}</ref>\n\n===Civilian===\nAlthough the majority of the world's submarines are military, there are some civilian submarines, which are used for tourism, exploration, oil and gas platform inspections, and pipeline surveys.

The submarine then visits underwater points of interest such as natural or artificial reef structures. To surface safely without danger of collision the location of the submarine is marked with an air release and movement to the surface is coordinated by an observer in a support craft.\n\nA recent development is the deployment of so-called [[narco submarine]]s by South American drug smugglers to evade law enforcement detection.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/05/AR2009060503718_3.html|work=The Washington Post|first1=William|last1=Booth|first2=Juan|last2=Forero|title=Plying the Pacific, Subs Surface as Key Tool of Drug Cartels|date=6 June 2009}}</ref> Although they occasionally deploy [[narco submarine#True submarines|true submarines]], most are self-propelled [[semi-submersible]]s, where a portion of the craft remains above water at all times.

To submerge hydrostatically, a ship must have negative buoyancy, either by increasing its own weight or decreasing its displacement of water. To control their displacement, submarines have [[ballast tank]]s, which can hold varying amounts of water and air.\n\nFor general submersion or surfacing, submarines use the forward and aft tanks, called Main Ballast Tanks (MBT), which are filled with water to submerge or with air to surface. Submerged, MBTs generally remain flooded, which simplifies their design, and on many submarines these tanks are a section of interhull space. For more precise and quick control of depth, submarines use smaller Depth Control Tanks (DCT)\u2014also called hard tanks (due to their ability to withstand higher pressure), or trim tanks. The amount of water in depth control tanks can be controlled to change depth or to maintain a constant depth as outside conditions (chiefly water density) change. Depth control tanks may be located either near the submarine's [[center of gravity]], or separated along the submarine body to prevent affecting [[dynamic trimming|trim]].\n\nWhen submerged, the water pressure on a submarine's hull can reach {{convert|4|MPa|psi|abbr=on|lk=on}} for steel submarines and up to {{convert|10|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} for [[titanium]] submarines like {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-278 Komsomolets||2}}, while interior pressure remains relatively unchanged. This difference results in hull compression, which decreases displacement. Water density also marginally increases with depth, as the [[salinity]] and pressure are higher.<ref name=nave>{{cite web|title=Bulk Elastic Properties|author=Nave, R.|work=HyperPhysics|publisher=[[Georgia State University]]|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html|accessdate=26 October 2007}}</ref> This change in density incompletely compensates for hull compression, so buoyancy decreases as depth increases. A submerged submarine is in an unstable equilibrium, having a tendency to either sink or float to the surface. Keeping a constant depth requires continual operation of either the depth control tanks or control surfaces.<ref name=\"Physics Of Liquids & Gases\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/tpecp_08.html|title=Physics Of Liquids & Gases|accessdate=7 October 2006|work=Elementary Classical Physics}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Richard O'Kane|title=Wahoo|url=https://archive.org/details/wahoopatrolsofam00okan|url-access=registration|publisher=Presidio Press|year=1987|page=[https://archive.org/details/wahoopatrolsofam00okan/page/12 12]}}</ref>\n\nSubmarines in a neutral buoyancy condition are not intrinsically trim-stable. To maintain desired trim, submarines use forward and aft trim tanks. Pumps can move water between the tanks, changing weight distribution and pointing the sub up or down. A similar system is sometimes used to maintain stability.\n\n[[File:Kiosk Casabianca.jpg|thumb|[[Sail (submarine)|Sail]] of the French nuclear submarine {{ship|French submarine|Casabianca|S603|2}}; note the diving planes, [[camouflage]]d masts, periscope, electronic warfare masts, hatch, and [[wikt:deadlight|deadlight]].]]\nThe hydrostatic effect of variable ballast tanks is not the only way to control the submarine underwater. Hydrodynamic maneuvering is done by several surfaces, which can be moved to create hydrodynamic forces when a submarine moves at sufficient speed. The stern planes (hydroplanes in UK), located near the propeller and normally horizontal, serve the same purpose as the trim tanks, controlling the trim, and are commonly used, while other control surfaces may not be present on all submarines. The fairwater planes on the sail and/or bow planes on the main body, both also horizontal, are closer to the center of gravity, and are used to control depth with less effect on the trim.<ref>{{cite book|title=Concepts In Submarine Design|author1=Roy Burcher |author2=Louis Rydill |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|page=170}}</ref>\n\nWhen a submarine performs an emergency surfacing, all depth and trim methods are used simultaneously, together with propelling the boat upwards. Such surfacing is very quick, so the sub may even partially jump out of the water, potentially damaging submarine systems.\n\n===Hull===\n{{main|Submarine hull}}\n\n====Overview====\n[[File:USS Greeneville (SSN 772) - dry dock Pearl Harbor (1).jpg|thumb|The [[US Navy]] {{sclass-|Los Angeles|submarine|0}} {{USS|Greeneville|SSN-772|6}} in dry dock, showing cigar-shaped hull]]\n\nModern submarines are cigar-shaped. This design, visible in early submarines, is sometimes called a \"[[teardrop hull]]\". It reduces the hydrodynamic [[drag (physics)|drag]] when submerged, but decreases the sea-keeping capabilities and increases drag while surfaced. Since the limitations of the propulsion systems of early submarines forced them to operate surfaced most of the time, their hull designs were a compromise. Because of the slow submerged speeds of those subs, usually well below 10&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|kt]] (18&nbsp;km/h), the increased drag for underwater travel was acceptable. Late in World War II, when technology allowed faster and longer submerged operation and increased aircraft surveillance forced submarines to stay submerged, hull designs became teardrop shaped again to reduce drag and noise. {{USS|Albacore|AGSS-569}} was a unique research submarine that pioneered the American version of the teardrop hull form (sometimes referred to as an \"Albacore hull\") of modern submarines. On modern military submarines the outer hull is covered with a layer of sound-absorbing rubber, or [[anechoic tile|anechoic plating]], to reduce detection.\n\nThe occupied pressure hulls of deep diving submarines such as {{ship|DSV|Alvin}} are spherical instead of cylindrical. This allows a more even distribution of stress at the great depth. A titanium frame is usually affixed to the pressure hull, providing attachment for ballast and trim systems, scientific instrumentation, battery packs, [[syntactic foam|syntactic flotation foam]], and lighting.\n\nA raised tower on top of a submarine accommodates the [[periscope]] and electronics masts, which can include radio, [[radar]], [[electronic warfare]], and other systems including the snorkel mast. In many early classes of submarines (see history), the control room, or \"conn\", was located inside this tower, which was known as the \"[[conning tower]]\". Since then, the conn has been located within the hull of the submarine, and the tower is now called the \"[[Sail (submarine)|sail]]\". The conn is distinct from the \"bridge\", a small open platform in the top of the sail, used for observation during surface operation.\n\n\"Bathtubs\" are related to conning towers but are used on smaller submarines. The bathtub is a metal cylinder surrounding the hatch that prevents waves from breaking directly into the cabin. It is needed because surfaced submarines have limited [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], that is, they lie low in the water. Bathtubs help prevent swamping the vessel.\n\n==== Single and double hulls ====\n[[File:U995 2004 1.jpg|thumb|{{GS|U-995||2}}, Type VIIC/41 U-boat of World War II, showing the ship-like lines of the outer hull for surface travel, blended into the cylindrical pressure hull structure.]]\n\nModern submarines and submersibles, as well as the oldest ones, usually have a single hull. Large submarines generally have an additional hull or hull sections outside. This external hull, which actually forms the shape of submarine, is called the outer hull (''[[Casing (submarine)|casing]]'' in the Royal Navy) or [[light hull]], as it does not have to withstand a pressure difference. Inside the outer hull there is a strong hull, or [[pressure hull]], which withstands sea pressure and has normal atmospheric pressure inside.\n\nAs early as World War I, it was realized that the optimal shape for withstanding pressure conflicted with the optimal shape for seakeeping and minimal drag, and construction difficulties further complicated the problem. This was solved either by a compromise shape, or by using two hulls; internal for holding pressure, and external for optimal shape. Until the end of World War II, most submarines had an additional partial cover on the top, bow and stern, built of thinner metal, which was flooded when submerged. Germany went further with the [[Type XXI]], a general predecessor of modern submarines, in which the pressure hull was fully enclosed inside the light hull, but optimized for submerged navigation, unlike earlier designs that were optimized for surface operation.\n\n[[File:SRH025-p40.jpg|thumb|left|[[Type XXI]] U-boat, late World War II, with pressure hull almost fully enclosed inside the light hull]]\nAfter World War II, approaches split. The Soviet Union changed its designs, basing them on German developments. All post-World War II heavy Soviet and Russian submarines are built with a [[double hull]] structure. American and most other Western submarines switched to a primarily single-hull approach. They still have light hull sections in the bow and stern, which house main ballast tanks and provide a hydrodynamically optimized shape, but the main cylindrical hull section has only a single plating layer. Double hulls are being considered for future submarines in the United States to improve payload capacity, stealth and range.<ref>[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2000/May/Virginia-Class.htm].

There are also examples of more than two hulls in a submarine, like the {{sclass2-|Typhoon|submarine|4}}, which has two main pressure hulls and three smaller ones for control room, torpedoes and steering gear, with the missile launch system between the main hulls.\n\nThe [[Submarine depth ratings|dive depth]] cannot be increased easily. Simply making the hull thicker increases the weight and requires reduction of onboard equipment weight, ultimately resulting in a ''[[bathyscaphe]]''. This is acceptable for civilian research submersibles, but not military submarines.\n\nWWI submarines had hulls of [[carbon steel]], with a {{convert|100|m|ft|adj=on}} maximum depth. During WWII, high-strength [[alloy]]ed steel was introduced, allowing {{convert|200|m|ft|adj=on}} depths. High-strength alloy steel remains the primary material for submarines today, with {{convert|250|-|400|m|ft|adj=on}} depths, which cannot be exceeded on a military submarine without design compromises. To exceed that limit, a few submarines were built with [[titanium]] hulls. Titanium can be stronger than steel, lighter, and is not [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]], important for stealth. Titanium submarines were built by the Soviet Union, which developed specialized high-strength alloys. It has produced several types of titanium submarines. Titanium alloys allow a major increase in depth, but other systems must be redesigned to cope, so test depth was limited to {{convert|1000|m|ft}} for the {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-278 Komsomolets}}, the deepest-diving combat submarine. An {{sclass2-|Alfa|submarine|2}} may have successfully operated at {{convert|1300|m|ft}},<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/deep.htm|title=Federation of American Scientists|publisher=Fas.org|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> though continuous operation at such depths would produce excessive stress on many submarine systems. Titanium does not flex as readily as steel, and may become brittle after many dive cycles. Despite its benefits, the high cost of titanium construction led to the abandonment of titanium submarine construction as the Cold War ended. Deep-diving civilian submarines have used thick [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] pressure hulls.\n\nThe deepest [[deep-submergence vehicle]] (DSV) to date is [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|''Trieste'']]. On 5 October 1959, ''Trieste'' departed San Diego for [[Guam]] aboard the freighter ''Santa Maria'' to participate in ''[[Project Nekton]]'', a series of very deep dives in the [[Mariana Trench]]. On 23 January 1960, ''Trieste'' reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep (the deepest southern part of the Mariana Trench), carrying [[Jacques Piccard]] (son of Auguste) and Lieutenant [[Don Walsh]], USN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t8/trieste.htm |title=Trieste |publisher=History.navy.mil |access-date=18 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317120249/http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t8/trieste.htm |archive-date=17 March 2010 |df= }}</ref> This was the first time a vessel, manned or unmanned, had reached the deepest point in the Earth's oceans. The onboard systems indicated a depth of {{convert|11521|m|ft|0}}, although this was later revised to {{convert|10916|m|ft|0}} and more accurate measurements made in 1995 have found the Challenger Deep slightly shallower, at {{convert|10911|m|ft|0}}.\n\nBuilding a pressure hull is difficult, as it must withstand pressures at its required diving depth. When the hull is perfectly round in cross-section, the pressure is evenly distributed, and causes only hull compression. If the shape is not perfect, the hull is bent, with several points heavily strained. Inevitable minor deviations are resisted by stiffener rings, but even a one-inch (25&nbsp;mm) deviation from roundness results in over 30 percent decrease of maximal hydrostatic load and consequently dive depth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.edu/naoe/courses/en200/ch10.pdf|title=US Naval Academy|publisher=}}</ref> The hull must therefore be constructed with high precision. All hull parts must be welded without defects, and all joints are checked multiple times with different methods, contributing to the high cost of modern submarines. (For example, each {{sclass-|Virginia|submarine|0}} attack submarine costs US$2.6 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], over US$200,000 per [[long ton|ton]] of displacement.)\n\n===Propulsion===<!-- \"diesel-electric transmission\" has a see also linking here -->\n{{Further|Marine propulsion|Air-independent propulsion|Nuclear marine propulsion|Nuclear submarine}}\n[[File:HMCS Windsor SSK 877.jpg|thumb|{{HMCS|Windsor|SSK 877|6}}, a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] {{sclass-|Victoria|submarine|0}} diesel-electric hunter-killer submarine]]\n\nThe first submarines were propelled by humans. The first mechanically driven submarine was the 1863 French {{ship|French submarine|Plongeur||2}}, which used compressed air for propulsion. Anaerobic propulsion was first employed by the Spanish ''[[Ictineo II]]'' in 1864, which used a solution of [[zinc]], [[manganese dioxide]], and [[potassium chlorate]] to generate sufficient heat to power a steam engine, while also providing [[oxygen]] for the crew. A similar system was not employed again until 1940 when the German Navy tested a [[hydrogen peroxide]]-based system, the [[Hellmuth Walter|Walter]] [[turbine]], on the experimental [[V-80 submarine]] and later on the naval {{GS|U-791||2}} and [[German Type XVII submarine|type XVII]] submarines;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sharkhunters.com/typeadditional.htm|title=Details on German U-Boat Types|accessdate=21 September 2008|work=Sharkhunters International}}</ref> the system was further developed for the British {{sclass-|Explorer|submarine|0}}, completed in 1958.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Miller, David  |author2=Jordan, John | title=Modern Submarine Warfare| location=London | publisher=Salamander Books | year=1987 | isbn=0-86101-317-4 |page =63 }}</ref>\n\nUntil the advent of [[nuclear marine propulsion]], most 20th-century submarines used batteries for running underwater and [[gasoline]] (petrol) or [[diesel engine|diesel]] engines on the surface, and for battery recharging. Early submarines used gasoline, but this quickly gave way to [[kerosene]] (paraffin), then diesel, because of reduced flammability. Diesel-electric became the standard means of propulsion. The diesel or gasoline engine and the electric motor, separated by clutches, were initially on the same shaft driving the propeller. This allowed the engine to drive the electric motor as a generator to recharge the batteries and also propel the submarine. The clutch between the motor and the engine would be disengaged when the submarine dived, so that the motor could drive the propeller. The motor could have multiple armatures on the shaft, which could be electrically coupled in series for slow speed and in parallel for high speed (these connections were called \"group down\" and \"group up\", respectively).\n\n==== Diesel-electric ====\n[[File:Submarine recharging (JMSDF).jpg|thumb|Recharging battery ([[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|JMSDF]])]]\n{{Further|Diesel-electric transmission}}\n\nEarly submarines used a direct mechanical connection between the engine and propeller, switching between diesel engines for surface running, and battery-driven electric motors for submerged propulsion.\n\nIn 1928, the [[United States Navy]]'s Bureau of Engineering proposed a diesel-electric transmission. Instead of driving the propeller directly while running on the surface, the submarine's diesel drove a generator that could either charge the submarine's batteries or drive the electric motor. This made electric motor speed independent of diesel engine speed, so the diesel could run at an optimum and non-critical speed. One or more diesel engines could be shut down for maintenance while the submarine continued to run on the remaining engine or battery power. The US pioneered this concept in 1929, in the [[United States S-class submarine|S-class submarines]] {{USS|S-3|SS-107|2}}, {{USS|S-6|SS-111|2}}, and {{USS|S-7|SS-112|2}}. The first production submarines with this system were the [[United States Porpoise-class submarine|''Porpoise'' class]] of the 1930s, and it was used on most subsequent US diesel submarines through the 1960s. No other navy adopted the system before 1945, apart from the Royal Navy's [[British U-class submarine|U-class submarines]], though some submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy used separate diesel generators for low speed running.<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Norman|title=U.S. submarines through 1945: an illustrated design history|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1995|pages=259\u2013260|isbn=978-1-55750-263-6}}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of such an arrangement were that a submarine could travel slowly with the engines at full power to recharge the batteries quickly, reducing time on the surface or on [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]]. It was then possible to [[soundproofing|isolate]] the noisy diesel engines from the pressure hull, making the submarine quieter. Additionally, diesel-electric transmissions were more compact.\n\nDuring World War II the Germans experimented with the idea of the [[Submarine snorkel|''schnorchel'']] (snorkel) from captured Dutch submarines, but didn't see the need for them until rather late in the war. The ''schnorchel'' was a retractable pipe that supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at [[periscope depth]], allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. There were problems with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Speed was limited to {{convert|8|kn|km/h}}, lest the device snap from stress. The ''schnorchel'' also created noise that made the boat easier to detect with sonar, yet more difficult for the on-board sonar to detect signals from other vessels. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the ''schnorchel'' mast could be detected beyond visual range.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ireland |first=Bernard |title=Battle of the Atlantic |publisher=Pen & Sword Books |year=2003 |location=Barnsley, UK |page=187 |isbn=978-1-84415-001-4}}</ref>\n\nWhile the snorkel renders a submarine far less detectable, it is not perfect. In clear weather, diesel exhaust can be seen on the surface to a distance of about three miles,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schull|first1=Joseph|title=The Far Distant Ships|date=1961|publisher=Queen's Printer, Canada|location=Ottawa|pages=259}}</ref> while \"periscope feather\" (the wave created by the snorkel or periscope moving through the water) is visible from far off in calm sea conditions.

Modern snorkel induction masts use a fail-safe design using [[compressed air]], controlled by a simple electrical circuit, to hold the \"head valve\" open against the pull of a powerful spring. Seawater washing over the mast shorts out exposed electrodes on top, breaking the control, and shutting the \"head valve\" while it is submerged. US submarines did not adopt the use of snorkels until after WWII.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GLy8quRc-YYC&pg=PA86&dq=submarine+snorkel#v=onepage&q=submarine%20snorkel&f=false|title=The Submarine|last=Navy|first=United States|date=September 2008|publisher=United States Printing Office|isbn=978-1-935327-44-8|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOne new technology that is being introduced starting with the Japanese Navy's eleventh [[S\u014dry\u016b-class submarine|''S\u014dry\u016b''-class submarine]] (JS ''\u014cry\u016b'') is a more modern battery, the [[lithium-ion battery]]. These batteries have about double the electric storage of traditional batteries, and by changing out the lead-acid batteries in their normal storage areas plus filling up the large hull space normally devoted to [[Air-independent propulsion|AIP]] engine and fuel tanks with many tons of lithium-ion batteries, modern submarines can actually return to a \"pure\" diesel-electric configuration yet have the added underwater range and power normally associated with AIP equipped submarines.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n====Air-independent====\n{{main|Air-independent propulsion}}\n[[File:2004-Bremerhaven U-Boot-Museum-Sicherlich retouched.jpg|thumb|[[German Type XXI submarine]]]]\n[[File:SS X-1 Midget Submarine.jpg|thumb|American X-1 Midget Submarine]]\n\nDuring World War II, [[German Type XXI submarine]]s (also known as \"''Elektroboote''\") were the first submarines designed to operate submerged for extended periods. Initially they were to carry hydrogen peroxide for long-term, fast air-independent propulsion, but were ultimately built with very large batteries instead. At the end of the War, the [[United Kingdom|British]] and Soviets experimented with hydrogen peroxide/kerosene (paraffin) engines that could run surfaced and submerged. The results were not encouraging. Though the Soviet Union deployed a class of submarines with this engine type (codenamed {{sclass2-|Quebec|submarine|5}} by NATO), they were considered unsuccessful.\n\nThe United States also used hydrogen peroxide in an experimental [[midget submarine]], [[USS X-1|X-1]]. It was originally powered by a hydrogen peroxide/diesel engine and battery system until an explosion of her hydrogen peroxide supply on 20 May 1957. X-1 was later converted to use diesel-electric drive.<ref>{{cite web|title=SS X-1 |url=http://www.hnsa.org/ships/x1.htm |publisher=Historic Naval Ships Association |access-date=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818031654/http://www.hnsa.org/ships/x1.htm |archive-date=18 August 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\nToday several navies use air-independent propulsion.

By eliminating the need for atmospheric oxygen, the time that a submarine could remain submerged was limited only by its food stores, as breathing air was recycled and fresh water [[Distillation|distilled]] from seawater. More importantly, a nuclear submarine has unlimited range at top speed. This allows it to travel from its operating base to the combat zone in a much shorter time and makes it a far more difficult target for most anti-submarine weapons. Nuclear-powered submarines have a relatively small battery and diesel engine/generator powerplant for emergency use if the reactors must be shut down.\n\nNuclear power is now used in all large submarines, but due to the high cost and large size of nuclear reactors, smaller submarines still use diesel-electric propulsion. The ratio of larger to smaller submarines depends on strategic needs.

Other major operators rely on a mix of nuclear submarines for strategic purposes and diesel-electric submarines for defense. Most fleets have no nuclear submarines, due to the limited availability of nuclear power and submarine technology.\n\nDiesel-electric submarines have a stealth advantage over their nuclear counterparts. Nuclear submarines generate noise from coolant pumps and turbo-machinery needed to operate the reactor, even at low power levels.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Roger|title=Lessons Not Learned|publisher=US Naval Institute Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-59114-865-4|page=34}}</ref> Some nuclear submarines such as the American {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|4}} can operate with their reactor coolant pumps secured, making them quieter than electric subs. A conventional submarine operating on batteries is almost completely silent, the only noise coming from the shaft bearings, propeller, and flow noise around the hull, all of which stops when the sub hovers in mid-water to listen, leaving only the noise from crew activity. Commercial submarines usually rely only on batteries, since they operate in conjunction with a mother ship.\n\nSeveral [[nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll|serious nuclear and radiation accidents]] have involved nuclear submarine mishaps.<ref name=johnston2007/><ref name=timenuke/> The {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-19}} reactor accident in 1961 resulted in 8 deaths and more than 30 other people were over-exposed to radiation.<ref name=rad>[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article1.pdf Strengthening the Safety of Radiation Sources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326181428/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article1.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }} p. 14</ref> The {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-27}} reactor accident in 1968 resulted in 9 fatalities and 83 other injuries.<ref name=johnston2007>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/radevents1.html|title=Deadliest radiation accidents and other events causing radiation casualties|author=Johnston, Robert|date=23 September 2007|publisher=Database of Radiological Incidents and Related Events}}</ref> The {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-431}} accident in 1985 resulted in 10 fatalities and 49 other radiation injuries.<ref name=timenuke>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1887705,00.html|title=The Worst Nuclear Disasters|work=TIME.com|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=25 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Alternative====\nOil-fired steam turbines powered the British [[British K-class submarine|K-class submarines]], built during [[World War I]] and later, to give them the surface speed to keep up with the battle fleet. The K-class subs were not very successful, however.\n\nToward the end of the 20th century, some submarines\u2014such as the British ''Vanguard'' class\u2014began to be fitted with [[pump-jet]] propulsors instead of propellers. Though these are heavier, more expensive, and less efficient than a propeller, they are significantly quieter, providing an important tactical advantage.\n\n===Armament===\n[[File:Ocelot-TorpedoTubes.JPG|thumb|The forward torpedo tubes in HMS ''Ocelot'']]\nThe success of the submarine is inextricably linked to the development of the [[torpedo]], invented by [[Robert Whitehead]] in 1866. His invention is essentially the same now as it was 140 years ago. Only with self-propelled torpedoes could the submarine make the leap from novelty to a weapon of war. Until the perfection of the [[Acoustic torpedo|guided torpedo]], multiple \"straight-running\" torpedoes were required to attack a target. With at most 20 to 25 torpedoes stored on board, the number of attacks was limited. To increase [[combat endurance]] most World War I submarines functioned as submersible gunboats, using their [[deck gun]]s against unarmed targets, and diving to escape and engage enemy warships. The importance of guns encouraged the development of the unsuccessful [[cruiser submarine|Submarine Cruiser]] such as the French {{ship|French submarine|Surcouf||2}} and the [[Royal Navy]]'s {{HMS|X1||2}} and [[British M-class submarine|M-class]] submarines. With the arrival of [[Anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) aircraft, guns became more for defense than attack. A more practical method of increasing combat endurance was the external torpedo tube, loaded only in port.\n\nThe ability of submarines to approach enemy harbours covertly led to their use as [[minelayer]]s. Minelaying submarines of World War I and World War II were specially built for that purpose. Modern submarine-laid [[Naval mine|mines]], such as the British Mark 5 [[Stonefish (mine)|Stonefish]] and Mark 6 Sea Urchin, can be deployed from a submarine's torpedo tubes.\n\nAfter World War II, both the US and the USSR experimented with submarine-launched [[cruise missile]]s such as the [[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] and [[P-5 Pyatyorka]]. Such missiles required the submarine to surface to fire its missiles. They were the forerunners of modern submarine-launched cruise missiles, which can be fired from the torpedo tubes of submerged submarines, for example the US [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] and Russian [[RPK-2 Viyuga]] and versions of surface-to-surface [[anti-ship missile]]s such as the [[Exocet]] and [[Boeing Harpoon|Harpoon]], encapsulated for submarine launch. Ballistic missiles can also be fired from a submarine's torpedo tubes, for example missiles such as the anti-submarine [[SUBROC]]. With internal volume as limited as ever and the desire to carry heavier warloads, the idea of the external launch tube was revived, usually for encapsulated missiles, with such tubes being placed between the internal pressure and outer streamlined hulls.\n\nThe strategic mission of the SSM-N-8 and the P-5 was taken up by [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] beginning with the US Navy's [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] missile, and subsequently the [[UGM-73 Poseidon|Poseidon]] and [[Trident (missile)|Trident]] missiles.\n\nGermany is working on the torpedo tube-launched short-range [[IDAS (missile)|IDAS missile]], which can be used against ASW helicopters, as well as surface ships and coastal targets.\n\n===Sensors===\n{{main|Sonar}}\n\nA submarine can have a variety of sensors, depending on its missions. Modern military submarines rely almost entirely on a suite of passive and active [[sonar]]s to locate targets. Active sonar relies on an audible \"ping\" to generate echoes to reveal objects around the submarine. Active systems are rarely used, as doing so reveals the sub's presence. Passive sonar is a set of sensitive hydrophones set into the hull or trailed in a towed array, normally trailing several hundred feet behind the sub. The towed array is the mainstay of NATO submarine detection systems, as it reduces the flow noise heard by operators. Hull mounted sonar is employed in addition to the towed array, as the towed array can't work in shallow depth and during maneuvering. In addition, sonar has a blind spot \"through\" the submarine, so a system on both the front and back works to eliminate that problem. As the towed array trails behind and below the submarine, it also allows the submarine to have a system both above and below the [[thermocline]] at the proper depth; sound passing through the thermocline is distorted resulting in a lower detection range.\n\nSubmarines also carry radar equipment to detect surface ships and aircraft. Submarine captains are more likely to use radar detection gear than active radar to detect targets, as radar can be detected far beyond its own return range, revealing the submarine. Periscopes are rarely used, except for position fixes and to verify a contact's identity.\n\nCivilian submarines, such as the {{ship|DSV|Alvin}} or the [[MIR (submersible)|Russian ''Mir'' submersibles]], rely on small active sonar sets and viewing ports to navigate. The human eye cannot detect sunlight below about {{convert|300|ft|m}} underwater, so high intensity lights are used to illuminate the viewing area.\n\n===Navigation===\n{{main|Submarine navigation}}\n[[File:Ocelot-Periscopes.JPG|thumb|The larger search [[periscope]], and the smaller, less detectable attack periscope on HMS ''Ocelot'']]\n\nEarly submarines had few navigation aids, but modern subs have a variety of navigation systems. Modern military submarines use an [[inertial guidance system]] for navigation while submerged, but drift error unavoidably builds over time. To counter this, the crew occasionally uses the [[Global Positioning System]] to obtain an accurate position. The [[periscope]]\u2014a retractable tube with a [[prism (optics)|prism]] system that provides a view of the surface\u2014is only used occasionally in modern submarines, since the visibility range is short. The {{sclass-|Virginia|submarine|0}} and {{sclass-|Astute|submarine|2}}s use [[photonics mast]]s rather than hull-penetrating optical periscopes. These masts must still be deployed above the surface, and use electronic sensors for visible light, infrared, laser range-finding, and electromagnetic surveillance. One benefit to hoisting the mast above the surface is that while the mast is above the water the entire sub is still below the water and is much harder to detect visually or by radar.\n\n===Communication===\n{{main|Communication with submarines}}\n\nMilitary submarines use several systems to communicate with distant command centers or other ships. One is [[VLF]] (very low frequency) radio, which can reach a submarine either on the surface or submerged to a fairly shallow depth, usually less than {{convert|250|ft|m}}. [[Extremely low frequency|ELF]] (extremely low frequency) can reach a submarine at greater depths, but has a very low bandwidth and is generally used to call a submerged sub to a shallower depth where VLF signals can reach. A submarine also has the option of floating a long, buoyant wire antenna to a shallower depth, allowing VLF transmissions by a deeply submerged boat.\n\nBy extending a radio mast, a submarine can also use a \"[[burst transmission]]\" technique. A burst transmission takes only a fraction of a second, minimizing a submarine's risk of detection.\n\nTo communicate with other submarines, a system known as Gertrude is used. Gertrude is basically a [[underwater telephone|sonar telephone]]. Voice communication from one submarine is transmitted by low power speakers into the water, where it is detected by passive sonars on the receiving submarine. The range of this system is probably very short, and using it radiates sound into the water, which can be heard by the enemy.\n\nCivilian submarines can use similar, albeit less powerful systems to communicate with support ships or other submersibles in the area.\n\n===Life support systems===\nWith [[nuclear reactor|nuclear power]] or [[air-independent propulsion]], submarines can remain submerged for months at a time. Conventional diesel submarines must periodically resurface or run on [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]] to recharge their batteries. Most modern military submarines generate breathing [[oxygen]] by [[electrolysis]] of water (using a device called an \"[[Elektron (ISS)#Elektron|Electrolytic Oxygen Generator]]\"). Atmosphere control equipment includes a [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] scrubber, which uses an [[Amine gas treating|amine]] absorbent to remove the gas from air and diffuse it into waste pumped overboard. A machine that uses a [[catalyst]] to convert [[carbon monoxide]] into carbon dioxide (removed by the CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber) and bonds [[hydrogen]] produced from the ship's storage battery with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce water, is also used. An atmosphere monitoring system samples the air from different areas of the ship for [[nitrogen]], oxygen, hydrogen, [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] and [[1,2-Dichlorotetrafluoroethane|R-114]] refrigerants, carbon dioxide, [[carbon monoxide]], and other gases. Poisonous gases are removed, and oxygen is replenished by use of an oxygen bank located in a main ballast tank. Some heavier submarines have two oxygen bleed stations (forward and aft). The oxygen in the air is sometimes kept a few percent less than atmospheric concentration to reduce fire risk.\n\nFresh water is produced by either an evaporator or a [[reverse osmosis]] unit. The primary use for fresh water is to provide feedwater for the reactor and steam propulsion plants. It is also available for showers, sinks, cooking and cleaning once propulsion plant needs have been met. Seawater is used to flush toilets, and the resulting \"[[Blackwater (waste)|black water]]\" is stored in a sanitary tank until it is blown overboard using pressurized air or pumped overboard by using a special sanitary pump. The blackwater-discharge system is difficult to operate, and the German [[Type VII submarine|Type VIIC]] boat {{GS|U-1206||2}} was lost with casualties because of [[human error]] while using this system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/u1206.htm|title=U-1206|publisher=Uboat.net|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> Water from showers and sinks is stored separately in \"[[greywater|grey water]]\" tanks and discharged overboard using drain pumps.\n\nTrash on modern large submarines is usually disposed of using a tube called a Trash Disposal Unit (TDU), where it is compacted into a galvanized steel can. At the bottom of the TDU is a large ball valve. An ice plug is set on top of the ball valve to protect it, the cans atop the ice plug. The top breech door is shut, and the TDU is flooded and equalized with sea pressure, the ball valve is opened and the cans fall out assisted by scrap iron weights in the cans. The TDU is also flushed with seawater to ensure it is completely empty and the ball valve is clear before closing the valve.\n\n==Crew==\n[[File:E class submarine interior IWM Q 18650.jpg|thumb|The interior of a [[British E-class submarine]]. An officer supervises submerging operations, c. 1914\u20131918.]]\n\nA typical nuclear submarine has a crew of over 80; conventional boats typically have fewer than 40. The conditions on a submarine can be difficult because crew members must work in isolation for long periods of time, without family contact. Submarines normally maintain [[radio silence]] to avoid detection. Operating a submarine is dangerous, even in peacetime, and many submarines have been lost in accidents.\n\n===Women===\n[[File:US Navy 100603-N-0000X-053 Midshipmen learn to pilot the submarine by training in the duties of the helm and planesman while underway aboard the Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarine USS West Virginia (SSBN 736).jpg|thumb|[[Midshipman|Midshipmen]] learn to pilot {{USS|West Virginia|SSBN-736|6}}.]]\n\nMost navies prohibited women from serving on submarines, even after they had been permitted to serve on surface warships.

Today, pregnant women are still not allowed to serve on submarines in Sweden.

Further, they noted that a woman complying with such high demands is unlikely to become pregnant.<ref name=\"swedfem\"/> In May 2014, three women became the RN's first female submariners.<ref>{{cite news|title=Royal Navy gets first female submariners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27278588|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=BBC|date=5 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nWomen have served on US Navy surface ships since 1993, and {{as of|lc=y|2011|alt=as of 2011\u20132012}}, began serving on submarines for the first time.

Submarines were first widely used during [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), and are now used in many [[navy|navies]] large and small. Military uses include attacking enemy surface [[ship]]s (merchant and military), or other submarines, [[aircraft carrier]] protection, [[blockade]] running, [[ballistic missile submarine]]s as part of a nuclear strike force, [[reconnaissance]], conventional land attack (for example using a [[cruise missile]]), and covert insertion of [[special forces]]. Civilian uses for submarines include [[marine science]], salvage, exploration and facility inspection and maintenance. Submarines can also be modified to perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or [[undersea cable]] repair. Submarines are also used in tourism and [[undersea archaeology]].\n\nMost large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical (or conical) ends and a vertical structure, usually located amidships, which houses communications and sensing devices as well as [[periscope]]s. In modern submarines, this structure is the \"[[Sail (submarine)|sail]]\" in American usage and \"fin\" in European usage. A \"[[conning tower]]\" was a feature of earlier designs: a separate pressure hull above the main body of the [[boat]] that allowed the use of shorter periscopes. There is a propeller (or pump jet) at the rear, and various hydrodynamic control fins. Smaller, deep-diving and specialty submarines may deviate significantly from this traditional layout. Submarines use [[diving plane]]s and also change the amount of water and air in [[ballast tank]]s to change [[buoyancy]] for submerging and surfacing.\n\nSubmarines have one of the widest ranges of types and capabilities of any vessel. They range from small autonomous examples and one- or two-person subs that operate for a few hours to vessels that can remain submerged for six months\u2014such as the Russian {{sclass2-|Typhoon|submarine|4}}, the biggest submarines ever built. Submarines can work at greater depths than are survivable or practical for human [[Underwater diving|divers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Worlds Biggest Submarine|url=http://englishrussia.com/2009/04/14/worlds-biggest-submarine/ |last=Sherman|first=Chris |date=14 April 2009|website=English Russia |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> Modern deep-diving submarines derive from the [[bathyscaphe]], which in turn evolved from the [[diving bell]].\n==History==\n{{Main|History of submarines}}\n\n=== Etymology ===\nWhereas the principal meaning of \"submarine\" is an armed, submersible [[warship]], the more general meaning is for any type of submersible craft.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/submarine |title=submarine |website=Lexico |access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> The definition as of 1899 was for any type of \"submarine boat\".<ref>''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993, Vol. 2 N\u2013Z</ref> By [[naval tradition]], submarines are still usually referred to as \"boats\" rather than as \"ships\", regardless of their size.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ROPWAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=pig+boat |title=Pigboat 39: An American Sub Goes to War |last=Gugliotta |first=Bobette |date=2014-02-17 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |isbn=9780813146317 |language=en}}</ref> In other navies with a history of large submarine fleets they are also \"boats\"; in German it is an {{lang|de|Unterseeboot}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unterseebootbau|last=Gabler, Ulrich |date=1997|publisher=Bernard und Graefe|isbn=3763759581|edition=4th |location=Koblenz|oclc=75848309|language=de}}</ref> or {{lang|de|U-Boot}} (under-sea boat)<ref>{{Cite book |title=Uboote im 2.

This era marked a pivotal time in submarine development, and several important technologies appeared. A number of nations built and used submarines. [[Diesel-electric transmission|Diesel electric]] propulsion became the dominant power system and equipment such as the periscope became standardized. Countries conducted many experiments on effective tactics and weapons for submarines, which led to their large impact in [[World War I]].\n\nThe [[Ireland|Irish]] inventor [[John Philip Holland]] built a model submarine in 1876 and a full-scale version in 1878, which were followed by a number of unsuccessful ones. In 1896 he designed the Holland Type VI submarine, which used internal combustion engine power on the surface and electric [[battery (electricity)|battery]] power underwater. Launched on 17 May 1897 at Navy Lt. [[Lewis Nixon (naval architect)|Lewis Nixon]]'s [[Crescent Shipyard]] in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], ''Holland VI'' was purchased by the [[United States Navy]] on 11 April 1900, becoming the Navy's first commissioned submarine, christened {{USS|Holland|SS-1|6}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9040797/John-Philip-Holland |title=John Philip Holland |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nCommissioned in June 1900, the French steam and electric {{ship|French submarine|Narval|Q4|2}} employed the now typical double-hull design, with a pressure hull inside the outer shell. These 200-ton ships had a range of over {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} underwater. The French submarine ''Aigrette'' in 1904 further improved the concept by using a diesel rather than a gasoline engine for surface power. Large numbers of these submarines were built, with seventy-six completed before 1914.\n\nThe Royal Navy commissioned five {{sclass2-|Holland|submarine|2}}s from [[Vickers]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]], under licence from the [[General Dynamics Electric Boat|Holland Torpedo Boat Company]] from 1901 to 1903. Construction of the boats took longer than anticipated, with the first only ready for a diving trial at sea on 6 April 1902. Although the design had been purchased entirely from the US company, the actual design used was an untested improvement to the original Holland design using a new {{convert|180|hp}} petrol engine.<ref>Galantin, Ignatius J., Admiral, USN (Ret.). Foreword to ''Submariner'' by Johnnie Coote, p. 1</ref>\n\nThese types of submarines were first used during the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u201305. Due to the blockade at [[Port Arthur, China|Port Arthur]], the Russians sent their submarines to [[Vladivostok]], where by 1 January 1905 there were seven boats, enough to create the world's first \"operational submarine fleet\". The new submarine fleet began patrols on 14 February, usually lasting for about 24 hours each. The first confrontation with Japanese warships occurred on 29 April 1905 when the Russian submarine [[Som-class submarine|''Som'']] was fired upon by Japanese torpedo boats, but then withdrew.<ref>Olender p. 175</ref>\n\n====World War I====\n[[File:U9Submarine.jpg|thumb|The German submarine {{SMU|U-9}}, which sank three British [[cruiser]]s in [[Action of 22 September 1914|less than an hour in September 1914]]]]\n\nMilitary submarines first made a significant impact in [[World War I]].

In August 1914, a flotilla of ten U-boats sailed from their base in [[Heligoland]] to attack Royal Navy warships in the [[North Sea]] in the first submarine war patrol in history.<ref>Gibson and Prendergast, p. 2</ref>\n\nThe U-boats' ability to function as practical war machines relied on new tactics, their numbers, and submarine technologies such as combination diesel-electric power system developed in the preceding years. More submersibles than true submarines, U-boats operated primarily on the surface using regular engines, submerging occasionally to attack under battery power. They were roughly triangular in cross-section, with a distinct [[keel]] to control rolling while surfaced, and a distinct bow. During World War I more than 5,000 [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] ships were sunk by U-boats.<ref>Roger Chickering, Stig F\u00f6rster, Bernd Greiner, German Historical Institute (Washington, DC) (2005). \"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=evVPoSwqrG4C&pg=PA73&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false A world at total war: global conflict and the politics of destruction, 1937\u20131945]''\".

(Shipping was vital to supply Britain's population with food, industry with raw material, and armed forces with fuel and armaments.) While U-boats destroyed a significant number of ships, the strategy ultimately failed. Although the U-boats had been updated in the interwar years, the major innovation was improved communications, encrypted using the famous [[Enigma machine|Enigma cipher machine]]. This allowed for mass-attack [[naval tactics]] (''Rudeltaktik'', commonly known as \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]\"), but was also ultimately the U-boats' downfall. By the end of the war, almost 3,000 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] ships (175 warships, 2,825 merchantmen) had been sunk by U-boats.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crocker III|first=H.

They also had submarines with the highest submerged speeds during World War II ({{sclass-|I-201|submarine|2}}s) and submarines that could carry multiple aircraft ({{sclass-|I-400|submarine|2}}s). They were also equipped with one of the most advanced torpedoes of the conflict, the oxygen-propelled [[Type 95 torpedo|Type 95]]. Nevertheless, despite their technical prowess, Japan chose to use its submarines for fleet warfare, and consequently were relatively unsuccessful, as warships were fast, maneuverable and well-defended compared to merchant ships.\n\nThe submarine force was the most effective anti-ship weapon in the American arsenal. Submarines, though only about 2 percent of the U.S. Navy, destroyed over 30 percent of the Japanese Navy, including 8 aircraft carriers, 1 battleship and 11 cruisers. US submarines also destroyed over 60 percent of the Japanese merchant fleet, crippling Japan's ability to supply its military forces and industrial war effort. [[Allied submarines in the Pacific War]] destroyed more Japanese shipping<!--because \"shipping\" means \"merchant\", generally, & that's the important factor--> than all other weapons combined. This feat was considerably aided by the Imperial Japanese Navy's failure to provide adequate escort forces for the nation's merchant fleet.\n\nDuring World War II, 314&nbsp;submarines served in the US Navy, of which nearly 260 were deployed to the Pacific.<ref name=\"O'Kane, p. 333\">O'Kane, p. 333</ref> When the Japanese attacked Hawaii in December 1941, 111 boats were in commission; 203 submarines from the {{sclass-|Gato|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Balao|submarine|5}}, and {{sclass-|Tench|submarine|4}}es were commissioned during the war.

Submarines would attack either on the surface, using deck guns or submerged, using [[torpedo]]es. They were particularly effective in sinking Allied transatlantic shipping in both World Wars, and in disrupting Japanese supply routes and naval operations in the Pacific in World War II.\n\n[[Naval mine|Mine]]-laying submarines were developed in the early part of the 20th century. The facility was used in both World Wars. Submarines were also used for inserting and removing covert agents and military forces in [[special operations]], for intelligence gathering, and to rescue aircrew during air attacks on islands, where the airmen would be told of safe places to crash-land so the submarines could rescue them. Submarines could carry cargo through hostile waters or act as supply vessels for other submarines.\n\nSubmarines could usually locate and attack other submarines only on the surface, although {{HMS|Venturer|P68|6}} managed to sink {{GS|U-864||2}} with a four torpedo spread while both were submerged. The British developed a specialized anti-submarine submarine in WWI, the [[British R-class submarine|R class]]. After WWII, with the development of the homing torpedo, better [[sonar]] systems, and [[nuclear propulsion]], submarines also became able to hunt each other effectively.\n\nThe development of [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] and submarine-launched [[cruise missile]]s gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from [[cluster bomb]]s to [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\nThe primary defense of a submarine lies in its ability to remain concealed in the depths of the ocean. Early submarines could be detected by the sound they made. Water is an excellent conductor of sound (much better than air), and submarines can detect and track comparatively noisy surface ships from long distances. Modern submarines are built with an emphasis on [[Stealth technology|stealth]]. Advanced [[propeller]] designs, extensive sound-reducing insulation, and special machinery help a submarine remain as quiet as ambient ocean noise, making them difficult to detect. It takes specialized technology to find and attack modern submarines.\n\n[[Sonar#Active sonar|Active sonar]] uses the reflection of sound emitted from the search equipment to detect submarines. It has been used since WWII by surface ships, submarines and aircraft (via dropped buoys and helicopter \"dipping\" arrays), but it reveals the emitter's position, and is susceptible to counter-measures.\n\nA concealed military submarine is a real threat, and because of its stealth, can force an enemy navy to waste resources searching large areas of ocean and protecting ships against attack. This advantage was vividly demonstrated in the 1982 [[Falklands War]] when the British [[nuclear-powered]] submarine {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}} sank the Argentine cruiser {{ship|ARA|General Belgrano||2}}. After the sinking the Argentine Navy recognized that they had no effective defense against submarine attack, and the Argentine surface fleet withdrew to port for the remainder of the war, though an Argentine submarine remained at sea.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Finlan\n | first = Alastair\n | title = The Royal Navy in the Falklands Conflict and the Gulf War: Culture and Strategy\n | publisher = Psychology Press\n | series = British Politics and Society\n | volume = 15\n | date = 2004\n | location = London\n | pages = 214\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=TmP27lCid8AC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=general+belgrano+naval+strategy#v=onepage&q=general%20belgrano%20naval%20strategy&f=false\n | isbn = 978-0-7146-5479-9 }}</ref>\n\n===Civilian===\nAlthough the majority of the world's submarines are military, there are some civilian submarines, which are used for tourism, exploration, oil and gas platform inspections, and pipeline surveys.

The submarine then visits underwater points of interest such as natural or artificial reef structures. To surface safely without danger of collision the location of the submarine is marked with an air release and movement to the surface is coordinated by an observer in a support craft.\n\nA recent development is the deployment of so-called [[narco submarine]]s by South American drug smugglers to evade law enforcement detection.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/05/AR2009060503718_3.html|work=The Washington Post|first1=William|last1=Booth|first2=Juan|last2=Forero|title=Plying the Pacific, Subs Surface as Key Tool of Drug Cartels|date=6 June 2009}}</ref> Although they occasionally deploy [[narco submarine#True submarines|true submarines]], most are self-propelled [[semi-submersible]]s, where a portion of the craft remains above water at all times.

To submerge hydrostatically, a ship must have negative buoyancy, either by increasing its own weight or decreasing its displacement of water. To control their displacement, submarines have [[ballast tank]]s, which can hold varying amounts of water and air.\n\nFor general submersion or surfacing, submarines use the forward and aft tanks, called Main Ballast Tanks (MBT), which are filled with water to submerge or with air to surface. Submerged, MBTs generally remain flooded, which simplifies their design, and on many submarines these tanks are a section of interhull space. For more precise and quick control of depth, submarines use smaller Depth Control Tanks (DCT)\u2014also called hard tanks (due to their ability to withstand higher pressure), or trim tanks. The amount of water in depth control tanks can be controlled to change depth or to maintain a constant depth as outside conditions (chiefly water density) change. Depth control tanks may be located either near the submarine's [[center of gravity]], or separated along the submarine body to prevent affecting [[dynamic trimming|trim]].\n\nWhen submerged, the water pressure on a submarine's hull can reach {{convert|4|MPa|psi|abbr=on|lk=on}} for steel submarines and up to {{convert|10|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} for [[titanium]] submarines like {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-278 Komsomolets||2}}, while interior pressure remains relatively unchanged. This difference results in hull compression, which decreases displacement. Water density also marginally increases with depth, as the [[salinity]] and pressure are higher.<ref name=nave>{{cite web|title=Bulk Elastic Properties|author=Nave, R.|work=HyperPhysics|publisher=[[Georgia State University]]|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html|accessdate=26 October 2007}}</ref> This change in density incompletely compensates for hull compression, so buoyancy decreases as depth increases. A submerged submarine is in an unstable equilibrium, having a tendency to either sink or float to the surface. Keeping a constant depth requires continual operation of either the depth control tanks or control surfaces.<ref name=\"Physics Of Liquids & Gases\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/tpecp_08.html|title=Physics Of Liquids & Gases|accessdate=7 October 2006|work=Elementary Classical Physics}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Richard O'Kane|title=Wahoo|url=https://archive.org/details/wahoopatrolsofam00okan|url-access=registration|publisher=Presidio Press|year=1987|page=[https://archive.org/details/wahoopatrolsofam00okan/page/12 12]}}</ref>\n\nSubmarines in a neutral buoyancy condition are not intrinsically trim-stable. To maintain desired trim, submarines use forward and aft trim tanks. Pumps can move water between the tanks, changing weight distribution and pointing the sub up or down. A similar system is sometimes used to maintain stability.\n\n[[File:Kiosk Casabianca.jpg|thumb|[[Sail (submarine)|Sail]] of the French nuclear submarine {{ship|French submarine|Casabianca|S603|2}}; note the diving planes, [[camouflage]]d masts, periscope, electronic warfare masts, hatch, and [[wikt:deadlight|deadlight]].]]\nThe hydrostatic effect of variable ballast tanks is not the only way to control the submarine underwater. Hydrodynamic maneuvering is done by several surfaces, which can be moved to create hydrodynamic forces when a submarine moves at sufficient speed. The stern planes (hydroplanes in UK), located near the propeller and normally horizontal, serve the same purpose as the trim tanks, controlling the trim, and are commonly used, while other control surfaces may not be present on all submarines. The fairwater planes on the sail and/or bow planes on the main body, both also horizontal, are closer to the center of gravity, and are used to control depth with less effect on the trim.<ref>{{cite book|title=Concepts In Submarine Design|author1=Roy Burcher |author2=Louis Rydill |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|page=170}}</ref>\n\nWhen a submarine performs an emergency surfacing, all depth and trim methods are used simultaneously, together with propelling the boat upwards. Such surfacing is very quick, so the sub may even partially jump out of the water, potentially damaging submarine systems.\n\n===Hull===\n{{main|Submarine hull}}\n\n====Overview====\n[[File:USS Greeneville (SSN 772) - dry dock Pearl Harbor (1).jpg|thumb|The [[US Navy]] {{sclass-|Los Angeles|submarine|0}} {{USS|Greeneville|SSN-772|6}} in dry dock, showing cigar-shaped hull]]\n\nModern submarines are cigar-shaped. This design, visible in early submarines, is sometimes called a \"[[teardrop hull]]\". It reduces the hydrodynamic [[drag (physics)|drag]] when submerged, but decreases the sea-keeping capabilities and increases drag while surfaced. Since the limitations of the propulsion systems of early submarines forced them to operate surfaced most of the time, their hull designs were a compromise. Because of the slow submerged speeds of those subs, usually well below 10&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|kt]] (18&nbsp;km/h), the increased drag for underwater travel was acceptable. Late in World War II, when technology allowed faster and longer submerged operation and increased aircraft surveillance forced submarines to stay submerged, hull designs became teardrop shaped again to reduce drag and noise. {{USS|Albacore|AGSS-569}} was a unique research submarine that pioneered the American version of the teardrop hull form (sometimes referred to as an \"Albacore hull\") of modern submarines. On modern military submarines the outer hull is covered with a layer of sound-absorbing rubber, or [[anechoic tile|anechoic plating]], to reduce detection.\n\nThe occupied pressure hulls of deep diving submarines such as {{ship|DSV|Alvin}} are spherical instead of cylindrical. This allows a more even distribution of stress at the great depth. A titanium frame is usually affixed to the pressure hull, providing attachment for ballast and trim systems, scientific instrumentation, battery packs, [[syntactic foam|syntactic flotation foam]], and lighting.\n\nA raised tower on top of a submarine accommodates the [[periscope]] and electronics masts, which can include radio, [[radar]], [[electronic warfare]], and other systems including the snorkel mast. In many early classes of submarines (see history), the control room, or \"conn\", was located inside this tower, which was known as the \"[[conning tower]]\". Since then, the conn has been located within the hull of the submarine, and the tower is now called the \"[[Sail (submarine)|sail]]\". The conn is distinct from the \"bridge\", a small open platform in the top of the sail, used for observation during surface operation.\n\n\"Bathtubs\" are related to conning towers but are used on smaller submarines. The bathtub is a metal cylinder surrounding the hatch that prevents waves from breaking directly into the cabin. It is needed because surfaced submarines have limited [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], that is, they lie low in the water. Bathtubs help prevent swamping the vessel.\n\n==== Single and double hulls ====\n[[File:U995 2004 1.jpg|thumb|{{GS|U-995||2}}, Type VIIC/41 U-boat of World War II, showing the ship-like lines of the outer hull for surface travel, blended into the cylindrical pressure hull structure.]]\n\nModern submarines and submersibles, as well as the oldest ones, usually have a single hull. Large submarines generally have an additional hull or hull sections outside. This external hull, which actually forms the shape of submarine, is called the outer hull (''[[Casing (submarine)|casing]]'' in the Royal Navy) or [[light hull]], as it does not have to withstand a pressure difference. Inside the outer hull there is a strong hull, or [[pressure hull]], which withstands sea pressure and has normal atmospheric pressure inside.\n\nAs early as World War I, it was realized that the optimal shape for withstanding pressure conflicted with the optimal shape for seakeeping and minimal drag, and construction difficulties further complicated the problem. This was solved either by a compromise shape, or by using two hulls; internal for holding pressure, and external for optimal shape. Until the end of World War II, most submarines had an additional partial cover on the top, bow and stern, built of thinner metal, which was flooded when submerged. Germany went further with the [[Type XXI]], a general predecessor of modern submarines, in which the pressure hull was fully enclosed inside the light hull, but optimized for submerged navigation, unlike earlier designs that were optimized for surface operation.\n\n[[File:SRH025-p40.jpg|thumb|left|[[Type XXI]] U-boat, late World War II, with pressure hull almost fully enclosed inside the light hull]]\nAfter World War II, approaches split. The Soviet Union changed its designs, basing them on German developments. All post-World War II heavy Soviet and Russian submarines are built with a [[double hull]] structure. American and most other Western submarines switched to a primarily single-hull approach. They still have light hull sections in the bow and stern, which house main ballast tanks and provide a hydrodynamically optimized shape, but the main cylindrical hull section has only a single plating layer. Double hulls are being considered for future submarines in the United States to improve payload capacity, stealth and range.<ref>[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2000/May/Virginia-Class.htm]. National Defense magazine. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/issues/2000/May/Virginia-Class.htm|date=April 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Pressure hull====\n[[File:Bathyscaphe Trieste.jpg|thumb|In 1960, [[Jacques Piccard]] and [[Don Walsh]] were the first people to explore the [[Challenger Deep|deepest part]] of the world's [[ocean]], and the deepest location on the surface of the Earth's crust, in the {{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste}} designed by [[Auguste Piccard]].]]\n\nThe pressure hull is generally constructed of thick high-strength steel with a complex structure and high strength reserve, and is separated with watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]] into several [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)|compartments]]. There are also examples of more than two hulls in a submarine, like the {{sclass2-|Typhoon|submarine|4}}, which has two main pressure hulls and three smaller ones for control room, torpedoes and steering gear, with the missile launch system between the main hulls.\n\nThe [[Submarine depth ratings|dive depth]] cannot be increased easily. Simply making the hull thicker increases the weight and requires reduction of onboard equipment weight, ultimately resulting in a ''[[bathyscaphe]]''. This is acceptable for civilian research submersibles, but not military submarines.\n\nWWI submarines had hulls of [[carbon steel]], with a {{convert|100|m|ft|adj=on}} maximum depth. During WWII, high-strength [[alloy]]ed steel was introduced, allowing {{convert|200|m|ft|adj=on}} depths. High-strength alloy steel remains the primary material for submarines today, with {{convert|250|-|400|m|ft|adj=on}} depths, which cannot be exceeded on a military submarine without design compromises. To exceed that limit, a few submarines were built with [[titanium]] hulls. Titanium can be stronger than steel, lighter, and is not [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]], important for stealth. Titanium submarines were built by the Soviet Union, which developed specialized high-strength alloys. It has produced several types of titanium submarines. Titanium alloys allow a major increase in depth, but other systems must be redesigned to cope, so test depth was limited to {{convert|1000|m|ft}} for the {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-278 Komsomolets}}, the deepest-diving combat submarine. An {{sclass2-|Alfa|submarine|2}} may have successfully operated at {{convert|1300|m|ft}},<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/deep.htm|title=Federation of American Scientists|publisher=Fas.org|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> though continuous operation at such depths would produce excessive stress on many submarine systems. Titanium does not flex as readily as steel, and may become brittle after many dive cycles. Despite its benefits, the high cost of titanium construction led to the abandonment of titanium submarine construction as the Cold War ended. Deep-diving civilian submarines have used thick [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] pressure hulls.\n\nThe deepest [[deep-submergence vehicle]] (DSV) to date is [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|''Trieste'']]. On 5 October 1959, ''Trieste'' departed San Diego for [[Guam]] aboard the freighter ''Santa Maria'' to participate in ''[[Project Nekton]]'', a series of very deep dives in the [[Mariana Trench]]. On 23 January 1960, ''Trieste'' reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep (the deepest southern part of the Mariana Trench), carrying [[Jacques Piccard]] (son of Auguste) and Lieutenant [[Don Walsh]], USN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t8/trieste.htm |title=Trieste |publisher=History.navy.mil |access-date=18 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317120249/http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t8/trieste.htm |archive-date=17 March 2010 |df= }}</ref> This was the first time a vessel, manned or unmanned, had reached the deepest point in the Earth's oceans. The onboard systems indicated a depth of {{convert|11521|m|ft|0}}, although this was later revised to {{convert|10916|m|ft|0}} and more accurate measurements made in 1995 have found the Challenger Deep slightly shallower, at {{convert|10911|m|ft|0}}.\n\nBuilding a pressure hull is difficult, as it must withstand pressures at its required diving depth. When the hull is perfectly round in cross-section, the pressure is evenly distributed, and causes only hull compression. If the shape is not perfect, the hull is bent, with several points heavily strained. Inevitable minor deviations are resisted by stiffener rings, but even a one-inch (25&nbsp;mm) deviation from roundness results in over 30 percent decrease of maximal hydrostatic load and consequently dive depth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.edu/naoe/courses/en200/ch10.pdf|title=US Naval Academy|publisher=}}</ref> The hull must therefore be constructed with high precision. All hull parts must be welded without defects, and all joints are checked multiple times with different methods, contributing to the high cost of modern submarines. (For example, each {{sclass-|Virginia|submarine|0}} attack submarine costs US$2.6 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], over US$200,000 per [[long ton|ton]] of displacement.)\n\n===Propulsion===<!-- \"diesel-electric transmission\" has a see also linking here -->\n{{Further|Marine propulsion|Air-independent propulsion|Nuclear marine propulsion|Nuclear submarine}}\n[[File:HMCS Windsor SSK 877.jpg|thumb|{{HMCS|Windsor|SSK 877|6}}, a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] {{sclass-|Victoria|submarine|0}} diesel-electric hunter-killer submarine]]\n\nThe first submarines were propelled by humans. The first mechanically driven submarine was the 1863 French {{ship|French submarine|Plongeur||2}}, which used compressed air for propulsion. Anaerobic propulsion was first employed by the Spanish ''[[Ictineo II]]'' in 1864, which used a solution of [[zinc]], [[manganese dioxide]], and [[potassium chlorate]] to generate sufficient heat to power a steam engine, while also providing [[oxygen]] for the crew. A similar system was not employed again until 1940 when the German Navy tested a [[hydrogen peroxide]]-based system, the [[Hellmuth Walter|Walter]] [[turbine]], on the experimental [[V-80 submarine]] and later on the naval {{GS|U-791||2}} and [[German Type XVII submarine|type XVII]] submarines;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sharkhunters.com/typeadditional.htm|title=Details on German U-Boat Types|accessdate=21 September 2008|work=Sharkhunters International}}</ref> the system was further developed for the British {{sclass-|Explorer|submarine|0}}, completed in 1958.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Miller, David  |author2=Jordan, John | title=Modern Submarine Warfare| location=London | publisher=Salamander Books | year=1987 | isbn=0-86101-317-4 |page =63 }}</ref>\n\nUntil the advent of [[nuclear marine propulsion]], most 20th-century submarines used batteries for running underwater and [[gasoline]] (petrol) or [[diesel engine|diesel]] engines on the surface, and for battery recharging. Early submarines used gasoline, but this quickly gave way to [[kerosene]] (paraffin), then diesel, because of reduced flammability. Diesel-electric became the standard means of propulsion. The diesel or gasoline engine and the electric motor, separated by clutches, were initially on the same shaft driving the propeller. This allowed the engine to drive the electric motor as a generator to recharge the batteries and also propel the submarine. The clutch between the motor and the engine would be disengaged when the submarine dived, so that the motor could drive the propeller. The motor could have multiple armatures on the shaft, which could be electrically coupled in series for slow speed and in parallel for high speed (these connections were called \"group down\" and \"group up\", respectively).\n\n==== Diesel-electric ====\n[[File:Submarine recharging (JMSDF).jpg|thumb|Recharging battery ([[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|JMSDF]])]]\n{{Further|Diesel-electric transmission}}\n\nEarly submarines used a direct mechanical connection between the engine and propeller, switching between diesel engines for surface running, and battery-driven electric motors for submerged propulsion.\n\nIn 1928, the [[United States Navy]]'s Bureau of Engineering proposed a diesel-electric transmission. Instead of driving the propeller directly while running on the surface, the submarine's diesel drove a generator that could either charge the submarine's batteries or drive the electric motor. This made electric motor speed independent of diesel engine speed, so the diesel could run at an optimum and non-critical speed. One or more diesel engines could be shut down for maintenance while the submarine continued to run on the remaining engine or battery power. The US pioneered this concept in 1929, in the [[United States S-class submarine|S-class submarines]] {{USS|S-3|SS-107|2}}, {{USS|S-6|SS-111|2}}, and {{USS|S-7|SS-112|2}}. The first production submarines with this system were the [[United States Porpoise-class submarine|''Porpoise'' class]] of the 1930s, and it was used on most subsequent US diesel submarines through the 1960s. No other navy adopted the system before 1945, apart from the Royal Navy's [[British U-class submarine|U-class submarines]], though some submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy used separate diesel generators for low speed running.<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Norman|title=U.S. submarines through 1945: an illustrated design history|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1995|pages=259\u2013260|isbn=978-1-55750-263-6}}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of such an arrangement were that a submarine could travel slowly with the engines at full power to recharge the batteries quickly, reducing time on the surface or on [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]]. It was then possible to [[soundproofing|isolate]] the noisy diesel engines from the pressure hull, making the submarine quieter. Additionally, diesel-electric transmissions were more compact.\n\nDuring World War II the Germans experimented with the idea of the [[Submarine snorkel|''schnorchel'']] (snorkel) from captured Dutch submarines, but didn't see the need for them until rather late in the war. The ''schnorchel'' was a retractable pipe that supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at [[periscope depth]], allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. There were problems with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Speed was limited to {{convert|8|kn|km/h}}, lest the device snap from stress. The ''schnorchel'' also created noise that made the boat easier to detect with sonar, yet more difficult for the on-board sonar to detect signals from other vessels. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the ''schnorchel'' mast could be detected beyond visual range.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ireland |first=Bernard |title=Battle of the Atlantic |publisher=Pen & Sword Books |year=2003 |location=Barnsley, UK |page=187 |isbn=978-1-84415-001-4}}</ref>\n\nWhile the snorkel renders a submarine far less detectable, it is not perfect. In clear weather, diesel exhaust can be seen on the surface to a distance of about three miles,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schull|first1=Joseph|title=The Far Distant Ships|date=1961|publisher=Queen's Printer, Canada|location=Ottawa|pages=259}}</ref> while \"periscope feather\" (the wave created by the snorkel or periscope moving through the water) is visible from far off in calm sea conditions.

Modern snorkel induction masts use a fail-safe design using [[compressed air]], controlled by a simple electrical circuit, to hold the \"head valve\" open against the pull of a powerful spring.

These batteries have about double the electric storage of traditional batteries, and by changing out the lead-acid batteries in their normal storage areas plus filling up the large hull space normally devoted to [[Air-independent propulsion|AIP]] engine and fuel tanks with many tons of lithium-ion batteries, modern submarines can actually return to a \"pure\" diesel-electric configuration yet have the added underwater range and power normally associated with AIP equipped submarines.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n====Air-independent====\n{{main|Air-independent propulsion}}\n[[File:2004-Bremerhaven U-Boot-Museum-Sicherlich retouched.jpg|thumb|[[German Type XXI submarine]]]]\n[[File:SS X-1 Midget Submarine.jpg|thumb|American X-1 Midget Submarine]]\n\nDuring World War II, [[German Type XXI submarine]]s (also known as \"''Elektroboote''\") were the first submarines designed to operate submerged for extended periods. Initially they were to carry hydrogen peroxide for long-term, fast air-independent propulsion, but were ultimately built with very large batteries instead. At the end of the War, the [[United Kingdom|British]] and Soviets experimented with hydrogen peroxide/kerosene (paraffin) engines that could run surfaced and submerged. The results were not encouraging. Though the Soviet Union deployed a class of submarines with this engine type (codenamed {{sclass2-|Quebec|submarine|5}} by NATO), they were considered unsuccessful.\n\nThe United States also used hydrogen peroxide in an experimental [[midget submarine]], [[USS X-1|X-1]]. It was originally powered by a hydrogen peroxide/diesel engine and battery system until an explosion of her hydrogen peroxide supply on 20 May 1957. X-1 was later converted to use diesel-electric drive.<ref>{{cite web|title=SS X-1 |url=http://www.hnsa.org/ships/x1.htm |publisher=Historic Naval Ships Association |access-date=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818031654/http://www.hnsa.org/ships/x1.htm |archive-date=18 August 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\nToday several navies use air-independent propulsion. Notably [[Sweden]] uses [[Stirling engine|Stirling technology]] on the {{sclass-|Gotland|submarine|0}} and {{sclass-|S\u00f6dermanland|submarine|2}}s. The Stirling engine is heated by burning diesel fuel with [[liquid oxygen]] from [[cryogenic]] tanks. A newer development in air-independent propulsion is [[hydrogen]] [[fuel cell]]s, first used on the [[Germany|German]] [[Type 212 submarine]], with nine 34&nbsp;kW or two 120&nbsp;kW cells and soon to be used in the new [[Spanish Navy|Spanish]] {{sclass2-|S-80|submarine|2}}s.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Defense Industry Daily|title=S-80: A Sub, for Spain, to Sail Out on the Main|date=15 December 2008|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/s80-a-sub-for-spain-to-sail-out-on-the-main-02517/||url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n====Nuclear power====\n{{main|Nuclear submarine|Nuclear marine propulsion}}\n[[File:Battery well of USS Nautilus.jpg|thumb|Battery well containing 126 cells on {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}, the first nuclear-powered submarine]]\n\nSteam power was resurrected in the 1950s with a nuclear-powered steam turbine driving a generator. By eliminating the need for atmospheric oxygen, the time that a submarine could remain submerged was limited only by its food stores, as breathing air was recycled and fresh water [[Distillation|distilled]] from seawater. More importantly, a nuclear submarine has unlimited range at top speed. This allows it to travel from its operating base to the combat zone in a much shorter time and makes it a far more difficult target for most anti-submarine weapons. Nuclear-powered submarines have a relatively small battery and diesel engine/generator powerplant for emergency use if the reactors must be shut down.\n\nNuclear power is now used in all large submarines, but due to the high cost and large size of nuclear reactors, smaller submarines still use diesel-electric propulsion. The ratio of larger to smaller submarines depends on strategic needs. The US Navy, [[French Navy]], and the British [[Royal Navy]] operate only [[nuclear submarine]]s,<ref name=\"Submarine Warfare\">{{cite web|url=http://www.odu.edu/ao/hrnrotc/students/ns_courses/101odu/sumbmarine%20presentation%202005.ppt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908003323/http://www.odu.edu/ao/hrnrotc/students/ns_courses/101odu/sumbmarine%20presentation%202005.ppt|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 September 2006|title=Submarine Warfare|access-date=7 October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/db/submarines/france/index.html|title=France Current Capabilities|publisher=Nti.org|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> which is explained by the need for distant operations. Other major operators rely on a mix of nuclear submarines for strategic purposes and diesel-electric submarines for defense. Most fleets have no nuclear submarines, due to the limited availability of nuclear power and submarine technology.\n\nDiesel-electric submarines have a stealth advantage over their nuclear counterparts. Nuclear submarines generate noise from coolant pumps and turbo-machinery needed to operate the reactor, even at low power levels.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Roger|title=Lessons Not Learned|publisher=US Naval Institute Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-59114-865-4|page=34}}</ref> Some nuclear submarines such as the American {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|4}} can operate with their reactor coolant pumps secured, making them quieter than electric subs. A conventional submarine operating on batteries is almost completely silent, the only noise coming from the shaft bearings, propeller, and flow noise around the hull, all of which stops when the sub hovers in mid-water to listen, leaving only the noise from crew activity. Commercial submarines usually rely only on batteries, since they operate in conjunction with a mother ship.\n\nSeveral [[nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll|serious nuclear and radiation accidents]] have involved nuclear submarine mishaps.<ref name=johnston2007/><ref name=timenuke/> The {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-19}} reactor accident in 1961 resulted in 8 deaths and more than 30 other people were over-exposed to radiation.<ref name=rad>[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article1.pdf Strengthening the Safety of Radiation Sources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326181428/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull413/article1.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }} p. 14</ref> The {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-27}} reactor accident in 1968 resulted in 9 fatalities and 83 other injuries.<ref name=johnston2007>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/radevents1.html|title=Deadliest radiation accidents and other events causing radiation casualties|author=Johnston, Robert|date=23 September 2007|publisher=Database of Radiological Incidents and Related Events}}</ref> The {{ship|Soviet submarine|K-431}} accident in 1985 resulted in 10 fatalities and 49 other radiation injuries.<ref name=timenuke>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1887705,00.html|title=The Worst Nuclear Disasters|work=TIME.com|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=25 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Alternative====\nOil-fired steam turbines powered the British [[British K-class submarine|K-class submarines]], built during [[World War I]] and later, to give them the surface speed to keep up with the battle fleet. The K-class subs were not very successful, however.\n\nToward the end of the 20th century, some submarines\u2014such as the British ''Vanguard'' class\u2014began to be fitted with [[pump-jet]] propulsors instead of propellers. Though these are heavier, more expensive, and less efficient than a propeller, they are significantly quieter, providing an important tactical advantage.\n\n===Armament===\n[[File:Ocelot-TorpedoTubes.JPG|thumb|The forward torpedo tubes in HMS ''Ocelot'']]\nThe success of the submarine is inextricably linked to the development of the [[torpedo]], invented by [[Robert Whitehead]] in 1866. His invention is essentially the same now as it was 140 years ago. Only with self-propelled torpedoes could the submarine make the leap from novelty to a weapon of war. Until the perfection of the [[Acoustic torpedo|guided torpedo]], multiple \"straight-running\" torpedoes were required to attack a target. With at most 20 to 25 torpedoes stored on board, the number of attacks was limited. To increase [[combat endurance]] most World War I submarines functioned as submersible gunboats, using their [[deck gun]]s against unarmed targets, and diving to escape and engage enemy warships. The importance of guns encouraged the development of the unsuccessful [[cruiser submarine|Submarine Cruiser]] such as the French {{ship|French submarine|Surcouf||2}} and the [[Royal Navy]]'s {{HMS|X1||2}} and [[British M-class submarine|M-class]] submarines. With the arrival of [[Anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) aircraft, guns became more for defense than attack. A more practical method of increasing combat endurance was the external torpedo tube, loaded only in port.\n\nThe ability of submarines to approach enemy harbours covertly led to their use as [[minelayer]]s. Minelaying submarines of World War I and World War II were specially built for that purpose. Modern submarine-laid [[Naval mine|mines]], such as the British Mark 5 [[Stonefish (mine)|Stonefish]] and Mark 6 Sea Urchin, can be deployed from a submarine's torpedo tubes.\n\nAfter World War II, both the US and the USSR experimented with submarine-launched [[cruise missile]]s such as the [[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] and [[P-5 Pyatyorka]]. Such missiles required the submarine to surface to fire its missiles. They were the forerunners of modern submarine-launched cruise missiles, which can be fired from the torpedo tubes of submerged submarines, for example the US [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] and Russian [[RPK-2 Viyuga]] and versions of surface-to-surface [[anti-ship missile]]s such as the [[Exocet]] and [[Boeing Harpoon|Harpoon]], encapsulated for submarine launch. Ballistic missiles can also be fired from a submarine's torpedo tubes, for example missiles such as the anti-submarine [[SUBROC]]. With internal volume as limited as ever and the desire to carry heavier warloads, the idea of the external launch tube was revived, usually for encapsulated missiles, with such tubes being placed between the internal pressure and outer streamlined hulls.\n\nThe strategic mission of the SSM-N-8 and the P-5 was taken up by [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]] beginning with the US Navy's [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] missile, and subsequently the [[UGM-73 Poseidon|Poseidon]] and [[Trident (missile)|Trident]] missiles.\n\nGermany is working on the torpedo tube-launched short-range [[IDAS (missile)|IDAS missile]], which can be used against ASW helicopters, as well as surface ships and coastal targets.\n\n===Sensors===\n{{main|Sonar}}\n\nA submarine can have a variety of sensors, depending on its missions. Modern military submarines rely almost entirely on a suite of passive and active [[sonar]]s to locate targets. Active sonar relies on an audible \"ping\" to generate echoes to reveal objects around the submarine. Active systems are rarely used, as doing so reveals the sub's presence. Passive sonar is a set of sensitive hydrophones set into the hull or trailed in a towed array, normally trailing several hundred feet behind the sub. The towed array is the mainstay of NATO submarine detection systems, as it reduces the flow noise heard by operators. Hull mounted sonar is employed in addition to the towed array, as the towed array can't work in shallow depth and during maneuvering. In addition, sonar has a blind spot \"through\" the submarine, so a system on both the front and back works to eliminate that problem. As the towed array trails behind and below the submarine, it also allows the submarine to have a system both above and below the [[thermocline]] at the proper depth; sound passing through the thermocline is distorted resulting in a lower detection range.\n\nSubmarines also carry radar equipment to detect surface ships and aircraft. Submarine captains are more likely to use radar detection gear than active radar to detect targets, as radar can be detected far beyond its own return range, revealing the submarine. Periscopes are rarely used, except for position fixes and to verify a contact's identity.\n\nCivilian submarines, such as the {{ship|DSV|Alvin}} or the [[MIR (submersible)|Russian ''Mir'' submersibles]], rely on small active sonar sets and viewing ports to navigate. The human eye cannot detect sunlight below about {{convert|300|ft|m}} underwater, so high intensity lights are used to illuminate the viewing area.\n\n===Navigation===\n{{main|Submarine navigation}}\n[[File:Ocelot-Periscopes.JPG|thumb|The larger search [[periscope]], and the smaller, less detectable attack periscope on HMS ''Ocelot'']]\n\nEarly submarines had few navigation aids, but modern subs have a variety of navigation systems. Modern military submarines use an [[inertial guidance system]] for navigation while submerged, but drift error unavoidably builds over time. To counter this, the crew occasionally uses the [[Global Positioning System]] to obtain an accurate position. The [[periscope]]\u2014a retractable tube with a [[prism (optics)|prism]] system that provides a view of the surface\u2014is only used occasionally in modern submarines, since the visibility range is short. The {{sclass-|Virginia|submarine|0}} and {{sclass-|Astute|submarine|2}}s use [[photonics mast]]s rather than hull-penetrating optical periscopes. These masts must still be deployed above the surface, and use electronic sensors for visible light, infrared, laser range-finding, and electromagnetic surveillance. One benefit to hoisting the mast above the surface is that while the mast is above the water the entire sub is still below the water and is much harder to detect visually or by radar.\n\n===Communication===\n{{main|Communication with submarines}}\n\nMilitary submarines use several systems to communicate with distant command centers or other ships. One is [[VLF]] (very low frequency) radio, which can reach a submarine either on the surface or submerged to a fairly shallow depth, usually less than {{convert|250|ft|m}}. [[Extremely low frequency|ELF]] (extremely low frequency) can reach a submarine at greater depths, but has a very low bandwidth and is generally used to call a submerged sub to a shallower depth where VLF signals can reach. A submarine also has the option of floating a long, buoyant wire antenna to a shallower depth, allowing VLF transmissions by a deeply submerged boat.\n\nBy extending a radio mast, a submarine can also use a \"[[burst transmission]]\" technique. A burst transmission takes only a fraction of a second, minimizing a submarine's risk of detection.\n\nTo communicate with other submarines, a system known as Gertrude is used. Gertrude is basically a [[underwater telephone|sonar telephone]]. Voice communication from one submarine is transmitted by low power speakers into the water, where it is detected by passive sonars on the receiving submarine. The range of this system is probably very short, and using it radiates sound into the water, which can be heard by the enemy.\n\nCivilian submarines can use similar, albeit less powerful systems to communicate with support ships or other submersibles in the area.\n\n===Life support systems===\nWith [[nuclear reactor|nuclear power]] or [[air-independent propulsion]], submarines can remain submerged for months at a time. Conventional diesel submarines must periodically resurface or run on [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]] to recharge their batteries. Most modern military submarines generate breathing [[oxygen]] by [[electrolysis]] of water (using a device called an \"[[Elektron (ISS)#Elektron|Electrolytic Oxygen Generator]]\"). Atmosphere control equipment includes a [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] scrubber, which uses an [[Amine gas treating|amine]] absorbent to remove the gas from air and diffuse it into waste pumped overboard. A machine that uses a [[catalyst]] to convert [[carbon monoxide]] into carbon dioxide (removed by the CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber) and bonds [[hydrogen]] produced from the ship's storage battery with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce water, is also used. An atmosphere monitoring system samples the air from different areas of the ship for [[nitrogen]], oxygen, hydrogen, [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] and [[1,2-Dichlorotetrafluoroethane|R-114]] refrigerants, carbon dioxide, [[carbon monoxide]], and other gases. Poisonous gases are removed, and oxygen is replenished by use of an oxygen bank located in a main ballast tank. Some heavier submarines have two oxygen bleed stations (forward and aft). The oxygen in the air is sometimes kept a few percent less than atmospheric concentration to reduce fire risk.\n\nFresh water is produced by either an evaporator or a [[reverse osmosis]] unit. The primary use for fresh water is to provide feedwater for the reactor and steam propulsion plants. It is also available for showers, sinks, cooking and cleaning once propulsion plant needs have been met. Seawater is used to flush toilets, and the resulting \"[[Blackwater (waste)|black water]]\" is stored in a sanitary tank until it is blown overboard using pressurized air or pumped overboard by using a special sanitary pump. The blackwater-discharge system is difficult to operate, and the German [[Type VII submarine|Type VIIC]] boat {{GS|U-1206||2}} was lost with casualties because of [[human error]] while using this system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/u1206.htm|title=U-1206|publisher=Uboat.net|accessdate=18 April 2010}}</ref> Water from showers and sinks is stored separately in \"[[greywater|grey water]]\" tanks and discharged overboard using drain pumps.\n\nTrash on modern large submarines is usually disposed of using a tube called a Trash Disposal Unit (TDU), where it is compacted into a galvanized steel can. At the bottom of the TDU is a large ball valve. An ice plug is set on top of the ball valve to protect it, the cans atop the ice plug. The top breech door is shut, and the TDU is flooded and equalized with sea pressure, the ball valve is opened and the cans fall out assisted by scrap iron weights in the cans. The TDU is also flushed with seawater to ensure it is completely empty and the ball valve is clear before closing the valve.\n\n==Crew==\n[[File:E class submarine interior IWM Q 18650.jpg|thumb|The interior of a [[British E-class submarine]]. An officer supervises submerging operations, c. 1914\u20131918.]]\n\nA typical nuclear submarine has a crew of over 80; conventional boats typically have fewer than 40. The conditions on a submarine can be difficult because crew members must work in isolation for long periods of time, without family contact. Submarines normally maintain [[radio silence]] to avoid detection. Operating a submarine is dangerous, even in peacetime, and many submarines have been lost in accidents.\n\n===Women===\n[[File:US Navy 100603-N-0000X-053 Midshipmen learn to pilot the submarine by training in the duties of the helm and planesman while underway aboard the Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarine USS West Virginia (SSBN 736).jpg|thumb|[[Midshipman|Midshipmen]] learn to pilot {{USS|West Virginia|SSBN-736|6}}.]]\n\nMost navies prohibited women from serving on submarines, even after they had been permitted to serve on surface warships.

In this role, the marquessate of Reading is currently the junior-most marquessate in the [[Order of precedence in England and Wales]].\n\nUpon the death of the [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|1st Marquess of Reading]], he was succeeded by his son, the second Marquess. He notably held ministerial office from 1951 to 1957 in the [[Conservative Government 1951-1957|Conservative administrations]] of [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Anthony Eden]]. {{As of|2013}} the titles are held by his grandson, the fourth Marquess, who succeeded his father in 1980. The family seat was Jaynes Court, near [[Bisley, Gloucestershire|Bisley]], [[Gloucestershire]].\n\nIn May 1804, the title of Baron Reading was offered to the outgoing Prime Minister, [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Henry Addington]], who had many links with the largely pre-industrialised town, as a subsidiary title of the customary retirement [[earldom]] for Prime Ministers.

The first jobs she found were in teaching. At a family gathering in 1952, a relative mentioned that the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) was hiring mathematicians.<ref name=\"NASA bio\" /> At the [[Langley Research Center|Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]], based in [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], Virginia, near [[Langley Field]], NACA hired African-American mathematicians as well as whites for their Guidance and Navigation Department. Johnson accepted a job offer from the agency in June 1953.<ref name=\"Katherine Johnson - Oral History\" />\n\nAccording to an oral history archived by the National Visionary Leadership Project:\n\n<blockquote>At first she [Johnson] worked in a pool of women performing math calculations. Katherine has referred to the women in the pool as virtual \"computers who wore skirts\". Their main job was to read the data from the black boxes of planes and carry out other precise mathematical tasks. Then one day, Katherine (and a colleague) were temporarily assigned to help the all-male flight research team. Katherine's knowledge of [[analytic geometry]] helped make quick allies of male bosses and colleagues to the extent that, \"they forgot to return me to the pool\".  While the racial and gender barriers were always there, Katherine says she ignored them. Katherine was assertive, asking to be included in editorial meetings (where no women had gone before). She simply told people she had done the work and that she belonged.<ref name=\"Katherine Johnson - Oral History\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nFrom 1953 to 1958, Johnson worked as a [[Human computer|computer]],<ref name=\"Jim Hodges\">{{cite web |title=She Was a Computer When Computers Wore Skirts |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_kjohnson.html |first=Jim |last=Hodges |publisher=NASA |work=Langley Research Center |date=August 26, 2008 |access-date=December 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124545/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_kjohnson.html |archive-date=November 14, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> analyzing topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft.

Their office was labeled as \"Colored Computers\". In an interview with [[WHRO-TV]], Johnson stated that she \"didn't feel the segregation at NASA, because everybody there was doing research.

The first jobs she found were in teaching. At a family gathering in 1952, a relative mentioned that the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) was hiring mathematicians.<ref name=\"NASA bio\" /> At the [[Langley Research Center|Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]], based in [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], Virginia, near [[Langley Field]], NACA hired African-American mathematicians as well as whites for their Guidance and Navigation Department. Johnson accepted a job offer from the agency in June 1953.<ref name=\"Katherine Johnson - Oral History\" />\n\nAccording to an oral history archived by the National Visionary Leadership Project:\n\n<blockquote>At first she [Johnson] worked in a pool of women performing math calculations. Katherine has referred to the women in the pool as virtual \"computers who wore skirts\". Their main job was to read the data from the black boxes of planes and carry out other precise mathematical tasks. Then one day, Katherine (and a colleague) were temporarily assigned to help the all-male flight research team. Katherine's knowledge of [[analytic geometry]] helped make quick allies of male bosses and colleagues to the extent that, \"they forgot to return me to the pool\".  While the racial and gender barriers were always there, Katherine says she ignored them. Katherine was assertive, asking to be included in editorial meetings (where no women had gone before). She simply told people she had done the work and that she belonged.<ref name=\"Katherine Johnson - Oral History\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nFrom 1953 to 1958, Johnson worked as a [[Human computer|computer]],<ref name=\"Jim Hodges\">{{cite web |title=She Was a Computer When Computers Wore Skirts |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_kjohnson.html |first=Jim |last=Hodges |publisher=NASA |work=Langley Research Center |date=August 26, 2008 |access-date=December 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114124545/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_kjohnson.html |archive-date=November 14, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> analyzing topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft. Originally assigned to the [[West Area Computers]] section supervised by mathematician [[Dorothy Vaughan]], Johnson was reassigned to the Guidance and Control Division of Langley's Flight Research Division. It was staffed by white male engineers.<ref name=\"buckley\" /> In keeping with state racial segregation laws, and federal workplace segregation introduced under President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in the early 20th&nbsp;century, Johnson and the other African-American women in the computing pool were required to work, eat, and use restrooms that were separate from those of their white peers. Their office was labeled as \"Colored Computers\". In an interview with [[WHRO-TV]], Johnson stated that she \"didn't feel the segregation at NASA, because everybody there was doing research. You had a mission and you worked on it, and it was important to you to do your job&nbsp;... and play bridge at lunch.\" She added: \"I didn't feel any segregation.

I had to be. In the early days of NASA women were not allowed to put their names on the reports&nbsp;\u2013 no woman in my division had had her name on a report.

{"title_page": "Amendment of the Constitution of India", "text_new": "{{Short description|Process of amending India's constitution}}{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=November 2018}}\n'''Amending the Constitution of India''' is the process of making changes to the nation's fundamental law or supreme law. The procedure of amendment in the constitution is laid down in Part XX (Article 368)Anuradha mondal of the [[Constitution of India]]. This procedure  ensures the sanctity of the Constitution of India and keeps a check on arbitrary power of the [[Parliament of India]].\n\nHowever, there is another limitation imposed on the amending power of the constitution of India, which developed during conflicts between the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] and Parliament, where Parliament wants to exercise discretionary use of power to amend the constitution while the Supreme Court wants to restrict that power.it is very important SHYAMASHREE ROY   \nThis has led to the laying down of various doctrines or rules in regard to checking the validity/legality of an amendment, the most famous among them is the [[Basic structure doctrine]] as laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of [[Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala]] .\n\n==Constituent Assembly debates==\nThe framers of the Constitution were neither in favour of the traditional theory of [[federalism]], which entrusts the task of constitutional amendment to a body other than the Legislature, nor did they favour a rigid special procedure for such amendments. They also never wanted to have a British-style system where [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is supreme. The framers, instead, adopted a combination of the \"theory of fundamental law\", which underlies the written [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] with the \"theory of parliamentary sovereignty\" as existing in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Constitution of India vests constituent power upon the Parliament subject to the special procedure laid down therein.<ref name=\"Nature and Scope\">{{cite web|title=Constitution Amendment: Nature and Scope of the Amending Process|url=http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|work=Lok Sabha Secretariat|accessdate=1 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013055/http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-03|url-status=dead|df=}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nDuring the discussion in the [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]] on this aspect, some members were in favour of adopting an easier mode of amending procedure for the initial five to ten years. Explaining why it was necessary to introduce an element of flexibility in the Constitution, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] observed in the Constituent Assembly on 8 November 1948, \"While we want this Constitution to be as solid and as permanent a structure as we can make it, nevertheless there is no permanence in Constitutions. There should be a certain flexibility. If you make anything rigid and permanent, you stop a nation\u2019s growth, the growth of a living, vital, organic people. Therefore, it has to be flexible ... while we, who are assembled in this House, undoubtedly represent the people of India, nevertheless I think it can be said, and truthfully, that when a new House, by whatever name it goes, is elected in terms of this Constitution, and every adult in India has the right to vote - man and woman - the House that emerges then will certainly be fully representative of every section of the Indian people. It is right that House elected so - under this Constitution of course it will have the right to do anything - should have an easy opportunity to make such changes as it wants to. But in any event, we should not make a Constitution, such as some other great countries have, which are so rigid that they do not and cannot be adapted easily to changing conditions. Today especially, when the world is in turmoil and we are passing through a very swift period of transition, what we may do today may not be wholly applicable tomorrow. Therefore, while we make a Constitution which is sound and as basic as we can, it should also be flexible ...\"<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly of India Debates (Proceedings) - Vol. VII|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/constituent/vol7p4.html|accessdate=1 December 2013|pages=322\u2013323|date=8 November 1948|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103153825/http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/constituent/vol7p4.html|archive-date=3 November 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nDr. P.S. Deshmukh believed that the amendment of the Constitution should be made easier as he felt there were contradictory provisions in some places which would be more and more apparent when the provisions were interpreted, and that the whole administration would suffer, if the amendment to the Constitution was not made easy. Brajeshwar Prasad also favoured a flexible Constitution so as to make it survive the test of time. He was of the opinion that rigidity tends to check progressive legislation or gradual innovation. On the other hand, H.V. Kamath favoured ensuring procedural safeguards to avoid the possibility of hasty amendment to the Constitution.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n{{quotation|\"It is said that the provisions contained in the Draft make amendment difficult. It is proposed that the Constitution should be amendable by a simple majority at least for some years. The argument is subtle and ingenious. It is said that this Constituent Assembly is not elected on adult suffrage while the future Parliament will be elected on adult suffrage and yet the former has been given the right to pass the Constitution by a simple majority while the latter has been denied the same right. It is paraded as one of the absurdities of the Draft Constitution. I must repudiate the charge because it is without foundation. To know how simple are the provisions of the Draft Constitution in respect of amending the Constitution one has only to study the provisions for amendment contained in the American and Australian Constitutions. Compared to them those contained in the Draft Constitution will be found to be the simplest. The Draft Constitution has eliminated the elaborate and difficult procedures such as a decision by a convention or a referendum ... It is only for amendments of specific matters\u2014and they are only few\u2014that the ratification of the State Legislatures is required. All other Articles of the Constitution are left to be amended by Parliament. The only limitation is that it shall be done by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of each House present and voting and a majority of the total membership of each House. It is difficult to conceive a simpler method of amending the Constitution.\n\nWhat is said to be the absurdity of the amending provisions is founded upon a misconception of the position of the Constituent Assembly and of the future Parliament elected under the Constitution. The Constituent Assembly in making a Constitution has no partisan motive. Beyond securing a good and workable Constitution it has no axe to grind. In considering the Articles of the Constitution it has no eye on getting through a particular measure. The future Parliament if it met as Constituent Assembly, its members will be acting as partisans seeking to carry amendments to the Constitution to facilitate the passing of party measures which they have failed to get through Parliament by reason of some Article of the Constitution which has acted as an obstacle in their way. Parliament will have an axe to grind while the Constituent Assembly has none. That is the difference between the Constituent Assembly and the future Parliament. That explains why the Constituent Assembly though elected on limited franchise can be trusted to pass the Constitution by simple majority and why the Parliament though elected on adult suffrage cannot be trusted with the same power to amend it.\"\n|[[B. R. Ambedkar]], speaking in the Constituent Assembly on 4 November 1948<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n}}\n\n==Procedure==\nThe Constitution of India provides for a distinctive amendment process when compared to the Constitutions of other nations. This can be described as partly flexible and partly rigid. The Constitution provides for a variety in the amending process. This feature has been commended by Australian academic Sir [[Kenneth Wheare]] who felt that uniformity in the amending process imposed \"quite unnecessary restrictions\" upon the amendment of parts of a Constitution.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/> An amendment of the Constitution can be initiated only by the introduction of a [[Bill (law)|Bill]] in either [[Parliament of India|House of Parliament]]. The Bill must then be passed in each House by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting.<ref>http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108220111/http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm |date=8 November 2012 }} {{PD-notice}}</ref> This is known as special majority. There is no provision for a [[joint sitting]] in case of disagreement between the two Houses. The Bill, passed by the required majority, is then presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill. If the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the provision to article 368, it must be [[Ratification|ratified]] by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. Although there is no prescribed time limit for ratification, it must be completed before the amending Bill is presented to the President for his assent.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nEvery constitutional amendment is formulated as a statute. The first amendment is called the \"Constitution (First Amendment) Act\", the second, the \"Constitution (Second Amendment) Act\", and so forth. Each usually has the long title \"An Act further to amend the Constitution of India\".\n\n===Types of amendments===\nThe original constitution provided for three categories of amendments. The first category of amendments are those contemplated in articles 4 (2), 169, 239A (2), 239AA (7b), 243M (4b), 243ZC (3), 244A (4), 356 (1)c, para 7(2) of Schedule V and para 21(2) of Schedule VI.<ref name=\"text\">{{cite web|title=Full text of the Constitution of India|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621134720/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|archive-date=2014-06-21|url-status=dead|df=}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> These amendments can be effected by Parliament by a [[Plurality voting system|simple majority]] such as that required for the passing of any ordinary law. The amendments under this category are specifically excluded from the purview of article 368 which is the specific provision in the Constitution dealing with the power and the procedure for the amendment of the Constitution. [[Part One of the Constitution of India|Article 4]] provides that laws made by Parliament under article 2 (relating to admission or establishment of new States) and [[Part One of the Constitution of India|article 3]] (relating to formation of new States and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing States) effecting amendments in the First Schedule or the Fourth Schedule and supplemental, incidental and consequential matters, shall not be deemed to be amendments of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. For example, the ''[[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]]'', which brought about the reorganization of the States in India, was passed by Parliament as an ordinary piece of legislation. In ''Mangal Singh v. Union of India'' (A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 944), the Supreme Court held that power to reduce the total number of members of Legislative Assembly below the minimum prescribed under article 170 (1) is implicit in the authority to make laws under article 4. Article 169 empowers Parliament to provide by law for the abolition or creation of the [[Vidhan Parishad|Legislative Councils]] in States and specifies that though such law shall contain such provisions for the amendment of the Constitution as may be necessary, it shall not be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. ''The Legislative Councils Act, 1957'', which provided for the creation of a Legislative Council in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and for increasing the strength of the Legislative Councils in certain other States, is an example of a law passed by Parliament in an exercise of its powers under article 169. The Fifth Schedule contains provisions as to the administration and control of the Schedule Areas and [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. Para 7 of the Schedule vests Parliament with plenary powers to enact laws amending the Schedule and lays down that no such law shall be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. Under Para 21 of the Sixth Schedule, Parliament has full power to enact laws amending the Sixth Schedule which contains provisions for the administration of Tribal Areas in the States of [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]] and [[Mizoram]]. No such law will be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368.\n\nThe second category includes amendments that can be effected by Parliament by a prescribed \u2018[[Supermajority|special majority]]\u2019; and the third category of amendments includes those that require, in addition to such \"special majority\", ratification by at least one-half of the State Legislatures. The last two categories are governed by article 368.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nAmbedkar speaking in the Constituent Assembly on 17 September 1949, pointed out that there were \"innumerable articles in the Constitution\" which left matters subject to laws made by Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly Debates - Volume IX|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/487574/|work=India Kanoon|accessdate=1 December 2013|page=1660|date=17 September 1949|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203012448/http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/487574/|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Under article 11, Parliament may make any provision relating to citizenship notwithstanding anything in article 5 to 10. Thus, by passing ordinary laws, Parliament may, in effect, provide, modify or annul the operation of certain provisions of the Constitution without actually amending them within the meaning of article 368. Since such laws do not, in fact, make any change whatsoever in the letter of the Constitution, they cannot be regarded as amendments of the Constitution nor categorized as such. Other examples include Part XXI of the Constitution\u2014\"Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions\" whereby \"Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution\" power is given to Parliament to make laws with respect to certain matters included in the State List (article 369); article 370 (1) (d) which empowers the President to modify, by order, provisions of the Constitution in their application to the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]; provisos to articles 83 (2) and 172 (1) empower Parliament to extend the lives of the House of the People and the Legislative Assembly of every State beyond a period of five years during the operation of a Proclamation of Emergency; and articles 83(1) and 172 (2) provide that the Council of States/Legislative Council of a State shall not be subject to dissolution but as nearly as possible one-t\n\n===Amendments under article 368===\nPart-xx Article 368 (1) of the Constitution of India grants constituent power to make formal amendments and  empowers Parliament to amend the Constitution by way of addition, variation or repeal of any provision according to the procedure laid down therein, which is different from the procedure for ordinary legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/4237119/Taming_the_tension_between_constituent_power_and_constituted_power_in_constitution_making_thoughts_on_delegability_of_constituent_power|title= constituent power versus legislative power|accessdate= 23 August 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150826234901/http://www.academia.edu/4237119/Taming_the_tension_between_constituent_power_and_constituted_power_in_constitution_making_thoughts_on_delegability_of_constituent_power|archive-date= 26 August 2015|url-status= live}}</ref> Article 368 has been amended by the 24th and 42nd Amendments in 1971 and 1976 respectively.

The Bill must then be passed in each House by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting. There is no provision for a joint sitting in case of disagreement between the two Houses. Total membership in this context has been defined to mean the total number of members comprising the House irrespective of any vacancies or absentees on any account vide Explanation to Rule 159 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nThe Bill, passed by the required majority, is then presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill. If the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to article 368, it must be ratified by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. These provisions relate to certain matters concerning the federal structure or of common interest to both the Union and the States viz., the election of the President (articles 54 and 55); the extent of the executive power of the Union and the States (articles 73 and 162); the High Courts for Union territories (article 241); The Union Judiciary and the High Courts in the States (Chapter IV of Part V and Chapter V of Part VI); the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States (Chapter I of Part XI and Seventh Schedule); the representation of States in Parliament; and the provision for amendment of the Constitution laid down in article 368. Ratification is done by a resolution passed by the State Legislatures. There is no specific time limit for the ratification of an amending Bill by the State Legislatures. However, the resolutions ratifying the proposed amendment must be passed before the amending Bill is presented to the President for his assent.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n===Rules of Procedure in Parliament===\n{{further|Lawmaking procedure in India}}\nArticle 368 does not specify the legislative procedure to be followed at various stages of enacting an amendment. There are gaps in the procedure as to how and after what notice a Bill is to be introduced, how it is to be passed by each House and how the President's assent is to be obtained. This point was decided by the Supreme Court in ''Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India'' (AIR 1951 SC 458). Delivering the judgment, Patanjali Sastri J. observed, \"Having provided for the constitution of a Parliament and prescribed a certain procedure for the conduct of its ordinary legislative business to be supplemented by rules made by each House (article 118), the makers of the Constitution must be taken to have intended Parliament to follow that procedure, so far as it may be applicable consistently with the express provisions of article 368, when they entrusted to it power of amending the Constitution.\" Hence, barring the requirements of special majority, ratification by the State Legislatures in certain cases, and the mandatory assent by the President, a Bill for amending the Constitution is dealt with the Parliament following the same legislative process as applicable to an ordinary piece of legislation. The Rules of the House in the Rajya Sabha do not contain special provisions with regard to Bills for the amendment of the Constitution and the Rules relating to ordinary Bills apply, subject to the requirements of article 368.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nThe Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business make certain specific provisions regarding amendment bills in the Lok Sabha. They relate to the voting procedure in the House at various stages of such Bills, in the light of the requirements of article 368; and the procedure before introduction in the case of such Bills, if sponsored by Private Members. Although the \"special majority\", required by article 368 is prima facie applicable only to the voting at the final stage, the Lok Sabha Rules prescribe adherence to this constitutional requirement at all the effective stages of the Bill, i.e., for adoption of the motion that the Bill be taken into consideration; that the Bill as reported by the Select/Joint Committee be taken into consideration, in case a Bill has been referred to a Committee; for adoption of each clause or schedule or clause or schedule as amended, of a Bill; or that the Bill or the Bill as amended, as the case may be, be passed.<ref name = \"Lok Sabha Rules\">{{cite book|title=Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha|year=2004|publisher=Lok Sabha Secretariat|location=New Delhi|page=67|edition=Eleventh|chapter=Rules 155 and 157}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThis provision was arrived at after consultation with the Attorney-General and detailed discussions in the Rules Committee. It has been described as \"evidently ''ex abundanti cautela''\", a Latin phrase, which in law, describes someone taking precautions against a very remote contingency.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/><ref>Gray, John (2006), ''\"Lawyer's Latin (a vade-mecum)\"'', Hale, London, {{ISBN|9780709082774}}.</ref> By strictly adhering to article 368, the provision is intended to ensure the validity of the procedure adopted, but also guard against the possibility of violation of the spirit and scheme of that article 29 by the consideration of a Bill seeking to amend the Constitution including its consideration clause by clause being concluded in the House with only the bare quorum present. Voting at all the above stages is by division. However, the Speaker may, with the concurrence of the House, put any group of clauses or schedules together to the vote of the House, provided that the Speaker will permit any of the clauses or schedules be put separately, if any member requests that. The Short Title, Enacting Formula and the Long Title are adopted by a simple majority. The adoption of amendments to clauses or schedules of the Bill, requires a majority of members present and voting in the same manner as in the case of any other Bill.<ref name = \"Lok Sabha Rules\"/>\n\n====Private Members' Bills====\nA Bill for amendment of the Constitution by a Private Member is governed by the rules applicable to Private Members' Bills in general. The period of one month's notice applies to such a Bill also. In addition, in Lok Sabha, such a Bill has to be examined and recommended by the Committee on Private Members\u2019 Bills before it is included in the List of Business. The Committee has laid down the following principles as guiding criteria in making their recommendations in regard to these Bills:\n\n{{quote|\n\"(i) The Constitution should be considered as a sacred document \u2014 a document which should not be lightly interfered with and it should be amended only when it is found absolutely necessary to do so. Such amendments may generally be brought forward when it is found that the interpretation of the various articles and provisions of the Constitution has not been in accordance with the intention behind such provisions and cases of lacunae or glaring inconsistencies have come to light. Such amendments should, however, normally be brought by the Government after considering the matter in all its aspects and consulting experts, and taking such other advice as they may deem fit.<br />\n(ii) Some time should elapse before a proper assessment of the working of the Constitution and its general effect is made so that any amendments that may be necessary are suggested as a result of sufficient experience.<br />\n(iii) Generally speaking, notice of Bills from Private Members should be examined in the background of the proposal or measures which the Government may be considering at the time so that consolidated proposals are brought forward before the House by the Government after collecting sufficient material and taking expert advice.<br />\n(iv) Whenever a Private Member\u2019s Bill raises issues of far-reaching importance and public interest, the Bill might be allowed to be introduced so that public opinion is ascertained and gauged to enable the House to consider the matter further. In determining whether a matter is of sufficient public importance, it should be examined whether the particular provisions in the Constitution are adequate to satisfy the current ideas and public demand at the time. In other words, the Constitution should be adapted to the current needs and demands of the progressive society and any rigidity which may impede progress should be avoided.\"<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>}}\n\n===Role of state legislatures===\nThe role of the states in constitutional amendment is limited. State legislatures cannot initiate any Bill or proposal for amendment of the Constitution. They are associated in the process of the amendment only through the ratification procedure laid down in article 368, in case the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to article 368. The only other provision for constitutional changes by state legislatures is to initiate the process for creating or abolishing Legislative Councils in their respective legislatures, and to give their views on a proposed Parliamentary bill seeking to affect the area, boundaries or name of any State or States which has been referred to them under the proviso to [[Part One of the Constitution of India|Article 3]]. However, this referral does not restrict Parliament's power to make any further amendments of the Bill.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nArticle 169 (1) reads, \"Notwithstanding anything in article 168, Parliament may by law provide for the abolition of the Legislative Council of a State having such a Council or for the creation of such a Council in a State having no such Council, if the Legislative Assembly of the State passes a resolution to that effect by a majority of the total membership of the Assembly and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of the Assembly present and voting.\" The proviso of article 3 provides that no bill for the purpose shall be introduced in either House of Parliament except on the recommendation of the President and unless, where the proposal contained in the Bill affects the area, boundaries or name of any of the States, the bill has been referred by the President to the Legislature of the State for expressing its views thereon within such period as may be specified in the reference or within such further period as the President may allow and the period so specified or allowed has expired.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n===Role of Union territories===\nUnion territories have no say in constitutional amendments, including the ratification process which is only open to States. [[Delhi]] and [[Puducherry]] are two union territories that are entitled, by special constitutional amendments, to have an elected Legislative Assembly and a Cabinet of ministers, thereby enjoying partial statehood powers. Both of these territories can participate in the ratification process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-third-non-bjp-state-delhi-ratifies-big-reform-gst-bill-2248576|title=Third non-BJP state Delhi ratifies 'big reform' GST bill {{!}} Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis|date=2016-08-24|work=dna|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028145535/http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-third-non-bjp-state-delhi-ratifies-big-reform-gst-bill-2248576|archive-date=28 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n==Limitations==\n{{Main|Basic structure doctrine}}\nThe Constitution can be amended any number of times by the Parliament; but only in the manner provided. There is no such limit provided in the constitution of India which allows it to enact only certain number of amendments in a year. In other words, Parliament is free to enact any number of constitutional amendment in any given year. Although Parliament must preserve the basic framework of the Constitution, there is no other limitation placed upon the amending power, meaning that there is no provision of the Constitution that cannot be amended. In ''Abdul Rahiman Jamaluddin v. Vithal Arjun (''AIR 1958 Bombay, 94, (1957)), the Bombay High Court held that any attempt to amend the Constitution by a Legislature other than Parliament, and in a manner different from that provided for, will be void and inoperative.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nThe Supreme Court first struck down a constitutional amendment in 1967, ruling in the case of ''[[I.C. Golak Nath and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr.|I.C. Golak Nath and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr]]''. An amendment was struck down on the basis that it violated Article 13: \"The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by [the charter of Fundamental Rights]\". The term \"law\" in this article was interpreted as including a constitutional amendment. Parliament responded by enacting the twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India which declared that \"nothing in Article 13 shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution\".\n\nThe current limitation on amendments comes from ''[[Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala]]'', where the Supreme Court ruled that amendments of the constitution must respect the \"[[basic structure]]\" of the constitution, and certain fundamental features of the constitution cannot be altered by amendment. Parliament attempted to remove this limitation by enacting the [[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|Forty-second Amendment]], which declared, among other provisions, that \"there shall be no limitation whatever on the constituent power of Parliament to amend ...this Constitution\". However, this change was itself later declared invalid by the Supreme Court in ''[[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]]''.\n\nThe issue of whether an entire constitutional amendment is void for want of ratification or only an amended provision required to be ratified under proviso to clause (2) of article 368 was debated before the Supreme Court in ''Kihota Hollohon v. Zachilhu ''(AIR 1993 SC 412), in which the constitutional validity of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution inserted by the 52nd Amendment in 1985 was challenged.  The decisions of the Speakers/Chairmen on disqualification, which had been challenged in different High Courts through different petitions, were heard by a five-member Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court. The case, now popularly known as Anti-Defection case, was decided in 1992. The Constitution Bench in its majority judgement upheld the validity of the Tenth Schedule, but declared Paragraph 7 of the Schedule invalid because it was not ratified by the required number of the Legislatures of the States as it brought about in terms and effect, a change in articles 136, 226 and 227 of the Constitution. While doing so, the majority treated Paragraph 7 as a severable part from the rest of the Schedule. However, in the [[dissenting opinion]], the minority of the Judges held that the entire Amendment is invalid for want of ratification.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n==Parts frequently amended==\n{{See also|List of amendments of the Constitution of India}}\n[[File:India constitutional amendments per decade.JPG|thumb|250px|right| Number of constitutional amendments in India per decade.<ref name=\"ncert\">{{cite book  |last=Sharma |first=Dinesh |author2=Singh, Jaya|author3= Maganathan, R.|title=Indian Constitution at Work |publisher=[[National Council of Educational Research and Training|NCERT]] |year=2002 |series=Political Science, Class XI|display-authors=etal}}</ref>]]\nDespite the [[super majority]] requirement in the Constitution, it is one of the most frequently amended governing documents in the world, and the most amended national constitution in the world;<ref name=\"Krishnamurthy2009\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.yale.edu/yjil/files_PDFs/vol34/Krishnamurthy.pdf |page=219 |title=Colonial Cousins: Explaining India and Canada\u2019s Unwritten Constitutional Principles |last=Krishnamurthi |first=Vivek |date=2009 |volume=34 |issue=1 |journal=[[Yale Journal of International Law]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075730/http://www.yale.edu/yjil/files_PDFs/vol34/Krishnamurthy.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> amendments have averaged about two a year. This is partly because the Constitution is so specific in spelling out government powers that amendments are often required to deal with matters that could be addressed by ordinary statutes in other democracies. As a result, it is the longest constitution of any sovereign nation in the world. It currently consists of over 117,000 words (450 articles plus 104 amendments). Another reason is that the Parliament of India is elected by means of single seat districts, under the [[plurality voting system]], used in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. This means that, it is possible for a party to win two thirds of the seats in Parliament without securing two thirds of the vote. For example, in the first two [[Lok Sabha]] elections held under the Constitution, the [[Indian National Congress]] party won less than one half of the national vote but roughly two thirds of seats in the chamber.\n\n===Fundamental Rights===\nThe most important and frequent reason for amendments to the Constitution is the curtailment of the [[Fundamental Rights in India|Fundamental Rights]] charter. This is achieved by inserting laws contrary to the fundamental rights provisions into Schedule 9 of the Constitution. Schedule 9 protects such laws from [[judicial review]]. The typical areas of restriction include laws relating to property rights, and affirmative action in favour of minority groups such as the \"scheduled castes\", \"scheduled tribes\", and other \"backward classes\" and also lower classes people.\n\nIn a [[landmark ruling]] in January 2007, a nine judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court of India confirmed that all laws (including those in Schedule 9) would be open to judicial review if they violate the \"basic structure of the constitution\".<ref name=\"Basic structure now ironcast\">{{cite news|title=Basic structure now ironcast|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-12/india/27885602_1_constitution-structure-common-man|accessdate=2 April 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=12 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402222003/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-12/india/27885602_1_constitution-structure-common-man|archive-date=2 April 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal|Chief Justice Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal]] noted, \"If laws put in the Ninth Schedule abridge or abrogate fundamental rights resulting in violation of the basic structure of the constitution, such laws need to be invalidated\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6251067.stm|title=India court opens laws to review|author=|date=4 April 2018|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413031110/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6251067.stm|archive-date=13 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Territorial changes===\n\nConstitutional amendments have been made to facilitate changes in the territorial extent of the Republic of India due to the incorporation of the former French colony of [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]], the former Portuguese colony of [[Goa]], and a minor exchange of territory with [[Pakistan]]. Amendments are also necessary with regard to littoral rights over the exclusive economic zone of 200&nbsp;mi and the formation of new states and union territories by the reorganization of existing states. Constitutional amendment under article 368 allows peaceful division of the country provided [[Fundamental Rights in India|fundamental rights]] (Article 13) are ensured in all the resultant countries. The constitution (ninth amendment) act, 1960 is an example which has ceded territory to old Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend9.htm |title= The constitution (ninth amendment) act, 1960 |accessdate= 23 March 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080125225558/http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend9.htm |archive-date= 25 January 2008 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n===Transitional provisions===\n\nThe constitution includes transitional provisions intended to remain in force only for a limited period. These need to be renewed periodically. For example, for continuing reservation in parliamentary seats for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes an constitutional amendment is enacted once in every ten years.\n\n===Democratic reform===\n\nAmendments have been made with the intent of reform the system of government and incorporating new \"checks and balances\" in the Constitution. These have included the following:\n\n* Creation of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.\n* Creation of the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes.\n* Creation of mechanisms for ''[[Panchayati Raj]]'' (local self governance).\n* Disqualification of members from changing party allegiance.\n* Restrictions on the size of the cabinet.\n* Restrictions on imposition of an internal emergency.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of amendments of the Constitution of India]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160416084719/http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/coi-4March2016.pdf Full text of the Constitution of India] (as of November 2015)\n* [http://constitution-of-india.pykih.com/ Pykih Data Visualization of Constitutional Amendments]\n\n[[Category:Constitution of India]]\n[[Category:Amendments of the Constitution of India]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Process of amending India's constitution}}{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=November 2018}}\n'''Amending the Constitution of India''' is the process of making changes to the nation's fundamental law or supreme law. The procedure of amendment in the constitution is laid down in Part XX (Article 368) of the [[Constitution of India]]. This procedure  ensures the sanctity of the Constitution of India and keeps a check on arbitrary power of the [[Parliament of India]].\n\nHowever, there is another limitation imposed on the amending power of the constitution of India, which developed during conflicts between the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] and Parliament, where Parliament wants to exercise discretionary use of power to amend the constitution while the Supreme Court wants to restrict that power.\nThis has led to the laying down of various doctrines or rules in regard to checking the validity/legality of an amendment, the most famous among them is the [[Basic structure doctrine]] as laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of [[Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala]] .\n\n==Constituent Assembly debates==\nThe framers of the Constitution were neither in favour of the traditional theory of [[federalism]], which entrusts the task of constitutional amendment to a body other than the Legislature, nor did they favour a rigid special procedure for such amendments. They also never wanted to have a British-style system where [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is supreme. The framers, instead, adopted a combination of the \"theory of fundamental law\", which underlies the written [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] with the \"theory of parliamentary sovereignty\" as existing in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Constitution of India vests constituent power upon the Parliament subject to the special procedure laid down therein.<ref name=\"Nature and Scope\">{{cite web|title=Constitution Amendment: Nature and Scope of the Amending Process|url=http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|work=Lok Sabha Secretariat|accessdate=1 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013055/http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-03|url-status=dead|df=}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nDuring the discussion in the [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]] on this aspect, some members were in favour of adopting an easier mode of amending procedure for the initial five to ten years. Explaining why it was necessary to introduce an element of flexibility in the Constitution, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] observed in the Constituent Assembly on 8 November 1948, \"While we want this Constitution to be as solid and as permanent a structure as we can make it, nevertheless there is no permanence in Constitutions. There should be a certain flexibility. If you make anything rigid and permanent, you stop a nation\u2019s growth, the growth of a living, vital, organic people. Therefore, it has to be flexible ... while we, who are assembled in this House, undoubtedly represent the people of India, nevertheless I think it can be said, and truthfully, that when a new House, by whatever name it goes, is elected in terms of this Constitution, and every adult in India has the right to vote - man and woman - the House that emerges then will certainly be fully representative of every section of the Indian people. It is right that House elected so - under this Constitution of course it will have the right to do anything - should have an easy opportunity to make such changes as it wants to. But in any event, we should not make a Constitution, such as some other great countries have, which are so rigid that they do not and cannot be adapted easily to changing conditions. Today especially, when the world is in turmoil and we are passing through a very swift period of transition, what we may do today may not be wholly applicable tomorrow. Therefore, while we make a Constitution which is sound and as basic as we can, it should also be flexible ...\"<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly of India Debates (Proceedings) - Vol. VII|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/constituent/vol7p4.html|accessdate=1 December 2013|pages=322\u2013323|date=8 November 1948|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103153825/http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/constituent/vol7p4.html|archive-date=3 November 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nDr. P.S. Deshmukh believed that the amendment of the Constitution should be made easier as he felt there were contradictory provisions in some places which would be more and more apparent when the provisions were interpreted, and that the whole administration would suffer, if the amendment to the Constitution was not made easy. Brajeshwar Prasad also favoured a flexible Constitution so as to make it survive the test of time. He was of the opinion that rigidity tends to check progressive legislation or gradual innovation. On the other hand, H.V. Kamath favoured ensuring procedural safeguards to avoid the possibility of hasty amendment to the Constitution.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n{{quotation|\"It is said that the provisions contained in the Draft make amendment difficult. It is proposed that the Constitution should be amendable by a simple majority at least for some years. The argument is subtle and ingenious. It is said that this Constituent Assembly is not elected on adult suffrage while the future Parliament will be elected on adult suffrage and yet the former has been given the right to pass the Constitution by a simple majority while the latter has been denied the same right. It is paraded as one of the absurdities of the Draft Constitution. I must repudiate the charge because it is without foundation. To know how simple are the provisions of the Draft Constitution in respect of amending the Constitution one has only to study the provisions for amendment contained in the American and Australian Constitutions. Compared to them those contained in the Draft Constitution will be found to be the simplest. The Draft Constitution has eliminated the elaborate and difficult procedures such as a decision by a convention or a referendum ... It is only for amendments of specific matters\u2014and they are only few\u2014that the ratification of the State Legislatures is required. All other Articles of the Constitution are left to be amended by Parliament. The only limitation is that it shall be done by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of each House present and voting and a majority of the total membership of each House. It is difficult to conceive a simpler method of amending the Constitution.\n\nWhat is said to be the absurdity of the amending provisions is founded upon a misconception of the position of the Constituent Assembly and of the future Parliament elected under the Constitution. The Constituent Assembly in making a Constitution has no partisan motive. Beyond securing a good and workable Constitution it has no axe to grind. In considering the Articles of the Constitution it has no eye on getting through a particular measure. The future Parliament if it met as Constituent Assembly, its members will be acting as partisans seeking to carry amendments to the Constitution to facilitate the passing of party measures which they have failed to get through Parliament by reason of some Article of the Constitution which has acted as an obstacle in their way. Parliament will have an axe to grind while the Constituent Assembly has none. That is the difference between the Constituent Assembly and the future Parliament. That explains why the Constituent Assembly though elected on limited franchise can be trusted to pass the Constitution by simple majority and why the Parliament though elected on adult suffrage cannot be trusted with the same power to amend it.\"\n|[[B. R. Ambedkar]], speaking in the Constituent Assembly on 4 November 1948<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n}}\n\n==Procedure==\nThe Constitution of India provides for a distinctive amendment process when compared to the Constitutions of other nations. This can be described as partly flexible and partly rigid. The Constitution provides for a variety in the amending process. This feature has been commended by Australian academic Sir [[Kenneth Wheare]] who felt that uniformity in the amending process imposed \"quite unnecessary restrictions\" upon the amendment of parts of a Constitution.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/> An amendment of the Constitution can be initiated only by the introduction of a [[Bill (law)|Bill]] in either [[Parliament of India|House of Parliament]]. The Bill must then be passed in each House by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting.<ref>http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108220111/http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm |date=8 November 2012 }} {{PD-notice}}</ref> This is known as special majority. There is no provision for a [[joint sitting]] in case of disagreement between the two Houses. The Bill, passed by the required majority, is then presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill. If the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the provision to article 368, it must be [[Ratification|ratified]] by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. Although there is no prescribed time limit for ratification, it must be completed before the amending Bill is presented to the President for his assent.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nEvery constitutional amendment is formulated as a statute. The first amendment is called the \"Constitution (First Amendment) Act\", the second, the \"Constitution (Second Amendment) Act\", and so forth. Each usually has the long title \"An Act further to amend the Constitution of India\".\n\n===Types of amendments===\nThe original constitution provided for three categories of amendments. The first category of amendments are those contemplated in articles 4 (2), 169, 239A (2), 239AA (7b), 243M (4b), 243ZC (3), 244A (4), 356 (1)c, para 7(2) of Schedule V and para 21(2) of Schedule VI.<ref name=\"text\">{{cite web|title=Full text of the Constitution of India|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621134720/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|archive-date=2014-06-21|url-status=dead|df=}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> These amendments can be effected by Parliament by a [[Plurality voting system|simple majority]] such as that required for the passing of any ordinary law. The amendments under this category are specifically excluded from the purview of article 368 which is the specific provision in the Constitution dealing with the power and the procedure for the amendment of the Constitution. [[Part One of the Constitution of India|Article 4]] provides that laws made by Parliament under article 2 (relating to admission or establishment of new States) and [[Part One of the Constitution of India|article 3]] (relating to formation of new States and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing States) effecting amendments in the First Schedule or the Fourth Schedule and supplemental, incidental and consequential matters, shall not be deemed to be amendments of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. For example, the ''[[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]]'', which brought about the reorganization of the States in India, was passed by Parliament as an ordinary piece of legislation. In ''Mangal Singh v. Union of India'' (A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 944), the Supreme Court held that power to reduce the total number of members of Legislative Assembly below the minimum prescribed under article 170 (1) is implicit in the authority to make laws under article 4. Article 169 empowers Parliament to provide by law for the abolition or creation of the [[Vidhan Parishad|Legislative Councils]] in States and specifies that though such law shall contain such provisions for the amendment of the Constitution as may be necessary, it shall not be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. ''The Legislative Councils Act, 1957'', which provided for the creation of a Legislative Council in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and for increasing the strength of the Legislative Councils in certain other States, is an example of a law passed by Parliament in an exercise of its powers under article 169. The Fifth Schedule contains provisions as to the administration and control of the Schedule Areas and [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. Para 7 of the Schedule vests Parliament with plenary powers to enact laws amending the Schedule and lays down that no such law shall be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. Under Para 21 of the Sixth Schedule, Parliament has full power to enact laws amending the Sixth Schedule which contains provisions for the administration of Tribal Areas in the States of [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]] and [[Mizoram]]. No such law will be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368.\n\nThe second category includes amendments that can be effected by Parliament by a prescribed \u2018[[Supermajority|special majority]]\u2019; and the third category of amendments includes those that require, in addition to such \"special majority\", ratification by at least one-half of the State Legislatures. The last two categories are governed by article 368.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nAmbedkar speaking in the Constituent Assembly on 17 September 1949, pointed out that there were \"innumerable articles in the Constitution\" which left matters subject to laws made by Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly Debates - Volume IX|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/487574/|work=India Kanoon|accessdate=1 December 2013|page=1660|date=17 September 1949|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203012448/http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/487574/|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Under article 11, Parliament may make any provision relating to citizenship notwithstanding anything in article 5 to 10. Thus, by passing ordinary laws, Parliament may, in effect, provide, modify or annul the operation of certain provisions of the Constitution without actually amending them within the meaning of article 368. Since such laws do not, in fact, make any change whatsoever in the letter of the Constitution, they cannot be regarded as amendments of the Constitution nor categorized as such. Other examples include Part XXI of the Constitution\u2014\"Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions\" whereby \"Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution\" power is given to Parliament to make laws with respect to certain matters included in the State List (article 369); article 370 (1) (d) which empowers the President to modify, by order, provisions of the Constitution in their application to the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]; provisos to articles 83 (2) and 172 (1) empower Parliament to extend the lives of the House of the People and the Legislative Assembly of every State beyond a period of five years during the operation of a Proclamation of Emergency; and articles 83(1) and 172 (2) provide that the Council of States/Legislative Council of a State shall not be subject to dissolution but as nearly as possible one-t\n\n===Amendments under article 368===\nPart-xx Article 368 (1) of the Constitution of India grants constituent power to make formal amendments and  empowers Parliament to amend the Constitution by way of addition, variation or repeal of any provision according to the procedure laid down therein, which is different from the procedure for ordinary legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/4237119/Taming_the_tension_between_constituent_power_and_constituted_power_in_constitution_making_thoughts_on_delegability_of_constituent_power|title= constituent power versus legislative power|accessdate= 23 August 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150826234901/http://www.academia.edu/4237119/Taming_the_tension_between_constituent_power_and_constituted_power_in_constitution_making_thoughts_on_delegability_of_constituent_power|archive-date= 26 August 2015|url-status= live}}</ref> Article 368 has been amended by the 24th and 42nd Amendments in 1971 and 1976 respectively.

The Bill must then be passed in each House by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting. There is no provision for a joint sitting in case of disagreement between the two Houses. Total membership in this context has been defined to mean the total number of members comprising the House irrespective of any vacancies or absentees on any account vide Explanation to Rule 159 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nThe Bill, passed by the required majority, is then presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill. If the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to article 368, it must be ratified by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. These provisions relate to certain matters concerning the federal structure or of common interest to both the Union and the States viz., the election of the President (articles 54 and 55); the extent of the executive power of the Union and the States (articles 73 and 162); the High Courts for Union territories (article 241); The Union Judiciary and the High Courts in the States (Chapter IV of Part V and Chapter V of Part VI); the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States (Chapter I of Part XI and Seventh Schedule); the representation of States in Parliament; and the provision for amendment of the Constitution laid down in article 368.

There are gaps in the procedure as to how and after what notice a Bill is to be introduced, how it is to be passed by each House and how the President's assent is to be obtained. This point was decided by the Supreme Court in ''Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India'' (AIR 1951 SC 458). Delivering the judgment, Patanjali Sastri J. observed, \"Having provided for the constitution of a Parliament and prescribed a certain procedure for the conduct of its ordinary legislative business to be supplemented by rules made by each House (article 118), the makers of the Constitution must be taken to have intended Parliament to follow that procedure, so far as it may be applicable consistently with the express provisions of article 368, when they entrusted to it power of amending the Constitution.\" Hence, barring the requirements of special majority, ratification by the State Legislatures in certain cases, and the mandatory assent by the President, a Bill for amending the Constitution is dealt with the Parliament following the same legislative process as applicable to an ordinary piece of legislation. The Rules of the House in the Rajya Sabha do not contain special provisions with regard to Bills for the amendment of the Constitution and the Rules relating to ordinary Bills apply, subject to the requirements of article 368.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nThe Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business make certain specific provisions regarding amendment bills in the Lok Sabha. They relate to the voting procedure in the House at various stages of such Bills, in the light of the requirements of article 368; and the procedure before introduction in the case of such Bills, if sponsored by Private Members. Although the \"special majority\", required by article 368 is prima facie applicable only to the voting at the final stage, the Lok Sabha Rules prescribe adherence to this constitutional requirement at all the effective stages of the Bill, i.e., for adoption of the motion that the Bill be taken into consideration; that the Bill as reported by the Select/Joint Committee be taken into consideration, in case a Bill has been referred to a Committee; for adoption of each clause or schedule or clause or schedule as amended, of a Bill; or that the Bill or the Bill as amended, as the case may be, be passed.<ref name = \"Lok Sabha Rules\">{{cite book|title=Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha|year=2004|publisher=Lok Sabha Secretariat|location=New Delhi|page=67|edition=Eleventh|chapter=Rules 155 and 157}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThis provision was arrived at after consultation with the Attorney-General and detailed discussions in the Rules Committee.

Voting at all the above stages is by division. However, the Speaker may, with the concurrence of the House, put any group of clauses or schedules together to the vote of the House, provided that the Speaker will permit any of the clauses or schedules be put separately, if any member requests that. The Short Title, Enacting Formula and the Long Title are adopted by a simple majority. The adoption of amendments to clauses or schedules of the Bill, requires a majority of members present and voting in the same manner as in the case of any other Bill.<ref name = \"Lok Sabha Rules\"/>\n\n====Private Members' Bills====\nA Bill for amendment of the Constitution by a Private Member is governed by the rules applicable to Private Members' Bills in general. The period of one month's notice applies to such a Bill also. In addition, in Lok Sabha, such a Bill has to be examined and recommended by the Committee on Private Members\u2019 Bills before it is included in the List of Business. The Committee has laid down the following principles as guiding criteria in making their recommendations in regard to these Bills:\n\n{{quote|\n\"(i) The Constitution should be considered as a sacred document \u2014 a document which should not be lightly interfered with and it should be amended only when it is found absolutely necessary to do so.

Such amendments should, however, normally be brought by the Government after considering the matter in all its aspects and consulting experts, and taking such other advice as they may deem fit.<br />\n(ii) Some time should elapse before a proper assessment of the working of the Constitution and its general effect is made so that any amendments that may be necessary are suggested as a result of sufficient experience.<br />\n(iii) Generally speaking, notice of Bills from Private Members should be examined in the background of the proposal or measures which the Government may be considering at the time so that consolidated proposals are brought forward before the House by the Government after collecting sufficient material and taking expert advice.<br />\n(iv) Whenever a Private Member\u2019s Bill raises issues of far-reaching importance and public interest, the Bill might be allowed to be introduced so that public opinion is ascertained and gauged to enable the House to consider the matter further. In determining whether a matter is of sufficient public importance, it should be examined whether the particular provisions in the Constitution are adequate to satisfy the current ideas and public demand at the time. In other words, the Constitution should be adapted to the current needs and demands of the progressive society and any rigidity which may impede progress should be avoided.\"<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>}}\n\n===Role of state legislatures===\nThe role of the states in constitutional amendment is limited. State legislatures cannot initiate any Bill or proposal for amendment of the Constitution. They are associated in the process of the amendment only through the ratification procedure laid down in article 368, in case the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to article 368. The only other provision for constitutional changes by state legislatures is to initiate the process for creating or abolishing Legislative Councils in their respective legislatures, and to give their views on a proposed Parliamentary bill seeking to affect the area, boundaries or name of any State or States which has been referred to them under the proviso to [[Part One of the Constitution of India|Article 3]]. However, this referral does not restrict Parliament's power to make any further amendments of the Bill.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nArticle 169 (1) reads, \"Notwithstanding anything in article 168, Parliament may by law provide for the abolition of the Legislative Council of a State having such a Council or for the creation of such a Council in a State having no such Council, if the Legislative Assembly of the State passes a resolution to that effect by a majority of the total membership of the Assembly and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of the Assembly present and voting.\" The proviso of article 3 provides that no bill for the purpose shall be introduced in either House of Parliament except on the recommendation of the President and unless, where the proposal contained in the Bill affects the area, boundaries or name of any of the States, the bill has been referred by the President to the Legislature of the State for expressing its views thereon within such period as may be specified in the reference or within such further period as the President may allow and the period so specified or allowed has expired.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n===Role of Union territories===\nUnion territories have no say in constitutional amendments, including the ratification process which is only open to States. [[Delhi]] and [[Puducherry]] are two union territories that are entitled, by special constitutional amendments, to have an elected Legislative Assembly and a Cabinet of ministers, thereby enjoying partial statehood powers. Both of these territories can participate in the ratification process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-third-non-bjp-state-delhi-ratifies-big-reform-gst-bill-2248576|title=Third non-BJP state Delhi ratifies 'big reform' GST bill {{!}} Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis|date=2016-08-24|work=dna|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028145535/http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-third-non-bjp-state-delhi-ratifies-big-reform-gst-bill-2248576|archive-date=28 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n==Limitations==\n{{Main|Basic structure doctrine}}\nThe Constitution can be amended any number of times by the Parliament; but only in the manner provided. There is no such limit provided in the constitution of India which allows it to enact only certain number of amendments in a year. In other words, Parliament is free to enact any number of constitutional amendment in any given year. Although Parliament must preserve the basic framework of the Constitution, there is no other limitation placed upon the amending power, meaning that there is no provision of the Constitution that cannot be amended. In ''Abdul Rahiman Jamaluddin v. Vithal Arjun (''AIR 1958 Bombay, 94, (1957)), the Bombay High Court held that any attempt to amend the Constitution by a Legislature other than Parliament, and in a manner different from that provided for, will be void and inoperative.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nThe Supreme Court first struck down a constitutional amendment in 1967, ruling in the case of ''[[I.C. Golak Nath and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr.|I.C. Golak Nath and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr]]''. An amendment was struck down on the basis that it violated Article 13: \"The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by [the charter of Fundamental Rights]\". The term \"law\" in this article was interpreted as including a constitutional amendment. Parliament responded by enacting the twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India which declared that \"nothing in Article 13 shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution\".\n\nThe current limitation on amendments comes from ''[[Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala]]'', where the Supreme Court ruled that amendments of the constitution must respect the \"[[basic structure]]\" of the constitution, and certain fundamental features of the constitution cannot be altered by amendment. Parliament attempted to remove this limitation by enacting the [[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|Forty-second Amendment]], which declared, among other provisions, that \"there shall be no limitation whatever on the constituent power of Parliament to amend ...this Constitution\". However, this change was itself later declared invalid by the Supreme Court in ''[[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]]''.\n\nThe issue of whether an entire constitutional amendment is void for want of ratification or only an amended provision required to be ratified under proviso to clause (2) of article 368 was debated before the Supreme Court in ''Kihota Hollohon v. Zachilhu ''(AIR 1993 SC 412), in which the constitutional validity of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution inserted by the 52nd Amendment in 1985 was challenged.  The decisions of the Speakers/Chairmen on disqualification, which had been challenged in different High Courts through different petitions, were heard by a five-member Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court. The case, now popularly known as Anti-Defection case, was decided in 1992. The Constitution Bench in its majority judgement upheld the validity of the Tenth Schedule, but declared Paragraph 7 of the Schedule invalid because it was not ratified by the required number of the Legislatures of the States as it brought about in terms and effect, a change in articles 136, 226 and 227 of the Constitution. While doing so, the majority treated Paragraph 7 as a severable part from the rest of the Schedule. However, in the [[dissenting opinion]], the minority of the Judges held that the entire Amendment is invalid for want of ratification.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n==Parts frequently amended==\n{{See also|List of amendments of the Constitution of India}}\n[[File:India constitutional amendments per decade.JPG|thumb|250px|right| Number of constitutional amendments in India per decade.<ref name=\"ncert\">{{cite book  |last=Sharma |first=Dinesh |author2=Singh, Jaya|author3= Maganathan, R.|title=Indian Constitution at Work |publisher=[[National Council of Educational Research and Training|NCERT]] |year=2002 |series=Political Science, Class XI|display-authors=etal}}</ref>]]\nDespite the [[super majority]] requirement in the Constitution, it is one of the most frequently amended governing documents in the world, and the most amended national constitution in the world;<ref name=\"Krishnamurthy2009\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.yale.edu/yjil/files_PDFs/vol34/Krishnamurthy.pdf |page=219 |title=Colonial Cousins: Explaining India and Canada\u2019s Unwritten Constitutional Principles |last=Krishnamurthi |first=Vivek |date=2009 |volume=34 |issue=1 |journal=[[Yale Journal of International Law]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075730/http://www.yale.edu/yjil/files_PDFs/vol34/Krishnamurthy.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> amendments have averaged about two a year. This is partly because the Constitution is so specific in spelling out government powers that amendments are often required to deal with matters that could be addressed by ordinary statutes in other democracies. As a result, it is the longest constitution of any sovereign nation in the world. It currently consists of over 117,000 words (450 articles plus 104 amendments). Another reason is that the Parliament of India is elected by means of single seat districts, under the [[plurality voting system]], used in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. This means that, it is possible for a party to win two thirds of the seats in Parliament without securing two thirds of the vote. For example, in the first two [[Lok Sabha]] elections held under the Constitution, the [[Indian National Congress]] party won less than one half of the national vote but roughly two thirds of seats in the chamber.\n\n===Fundamental Rights===\nThe most important and frequent reason for amendments to the Constitution is the curtailment of the [[Fundamental Rights in India|Fundamental Rights]] charter. This is achieved by inserting laws contrary to the fundamental rights provisions into Schedule 9 of the Constitution. Schedule 9 protects such laws from [[judicial review]]. The typical areas of restriction include laws relating to property rights, and affirmative action in favour of minority groups such as the \"scheduled castes\", \"scheduled tribes\", and other \"backward classes\" and also lower classes people.\n\nIn a [[landmark ruling]] in January 2007, a nine judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court of India confirmed that all laws (including those in Schedule 9) would be open to judicial review if they violate the \"basic structure of the constitution\".<ref name=\"Basic structure now ironcast\">{{cite news|title=Basic structure now ironcast|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-12/india/27885602_1_constitution-structure-common-man|accessdate=2 April 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=12 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402222003/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-12/india/27885602_1_constitution-structure-common-man|archive-date=2 April 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal|Chief Justice Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal]] noted, \"If laws put in the Ninth Schedule abridge or abrogate fundamental rights resulting in violation of the basic structure of the constitution, such laws need to be invalidated\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6251067.stm|title=India court opens laws to review|author=|date=4 April 2018|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413031110/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6251067.stm|archive-date=13 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Territorial changes===\n\nConstitutional amendments have been made to facilitate changes in the territorial extent of the Republic of India due to the incorporation of the former French colony of [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]], the former Portuguese colony of [[Goa]], and a minor exchange of territory with [[Pakistan]]. Amendments are also necessary with regard to littoral rights over the exclusive economic zone of 200&nbsp;mi and the formation of new states and union territories by the reorganization of existing states. Constitutional amendment under article 368 allows peaceful division of the country provided [[Fundamental Rights in India|fundamental rights]] (Article 13) are ensured in all the resultant countries. The constitution (ninth amendment) act, 1960 is an example which has ceded territory to old Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend9.htm |title= The constitution (ninth amendment) act, 1960 |accessdate= 23 March 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080125225558/http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend9.htm |archive-date= 25 January 2008 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n===Transitional provisions===\n\nThe constitution includes transitional provisions intended to remain in force only for a limited period. These need to be renewed periodically. For example, for continuing reservation in parliamentary seats for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes an constitutional amendment is enacted once in every ten years.\n\n===Democratic reform===\n\nAmendments have been made with the intent of reform the system of government and incorporating new \"checks and balances\" in the Constitution. These have included the following:\n\n* Creation of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.\n* Creation of the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes.\n* Creation of mechanisms for ''[[Panchayati Raj]]'' (local self governance).\n* Disqualification of members from changing party allegiance.\n* Restrictions on the size of the cabinet.\n* Restrictions on imposition of an internal emergency.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of amendments of the Constitution of India]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160416084719/http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/coi-4March2016.pdf Full text of the Constitution of India] (as of November 2015)\n* [http://constitution-of-india.pykih.com/ Pykih Data Visualization of Constitutional Amendments]\n\n[[Category:Constitution of India]]\n[[Category:Amendments of the Constitution of India]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4061:711:cba2:989e:2dff:feba:11c7", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India"}
