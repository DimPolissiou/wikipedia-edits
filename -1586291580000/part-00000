Stuart arrived from [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]] at Lee's headquarters shortly after noon on July 2 and his exhausted brigades arrived that evening, too late to affect the planning or execution of the second day's battle. Hampton's brigade camped to the north, following a relatively minor clash with Union cavalry at [[Battle of Hunterstown|Hunterstown]] that afternoon.<ref>Coddington, pp. 266-67; Eicher, pp. 506-7; Sears, p. 257; Wert, p. 258.</ref>\n\nLee's orders for Stuart were to prepare for operations on July 3 in support of the Confederate infantry assault against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Stuart was to protect the Confederate left flank and attempt to move around the Union right flank and into the enemy's rear. If Stuart's forces could proceed south from the York Pike along the Low Dutch Road, they would soon reach the Baltimore Pike--the main avenue of communications for the Army of the Potomac--and they could launch devastating and demoralizing attacks against the Union rear, capitalizing on the confusion from the assault (Pickett's Charge) that Lee planned for the Union center.<ref>Wert, pp. 255-56; Coddington, p. 520; Sears, p. 391; Longacre, p. 221.</ref>\n\nConfederate cavalry forces under Stuart for this operation consisted of the three brigades he had taken on his ride around the Union Army (commanded by [[Brig. Gen. (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]], Brig. Gen. [[Fitzhugh Lee]] and [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[John Chambliss]]) and the brigade of Col. [[Albert G. Jenkins]] (under the command of Col. [[Milton J. Ferguson (officer)|Milton J. Ferguson]] following Jenkins' wounding on July 2). Although these four brigades should have amounted to approximately 5,000 men, it is likely that only 3,430 men and 13 guns saw action that day.<ref>Sears, pp. 459-60; Wert, p. 260, claims 5,000 troopers; Longacre, p. 220, 6,000.</ref> And following their nine-day ride around Maryland and Pennsylvania, they and their horses were weary and not in prime condition for battle.<ref>Coddington, p. 250.</ref>\n\nUnion cavalry forces were from the corps of [[Major general (United States)|Maj.

Since most of Buford's division had retired to [[Westminster, Maryland]] (with the exception of his reserve brigade under Brig. Gen. [[Wesley Merritt]], which was deployed directly south of Gettysburg), only two divisions were ready for action. Stationed near the intersection of the Hanover Road and the Low Dutch Road&mdash;directly on Stuart's path&mdash;was the division of Brig. Gen. [[David McM. Gregg]]. Gregg had two brigades present at Gettysburg, under Col. [[John Baillie McIntosh|John B. McIntosh]] and Col. [[J. Irvin Gregg]] (David Gregg's cousin), but the latter was stationed on the Baltimore Pike. David Gregg's one-brigade command was supplemented by the newly formed \"[[Michigan Brigade]]\" of Brig. Gen. [[George Armstrong Custer]]. Custer was assigned to the division of Brig. Gen. [[Judson Kilpatrick]] but happened to be on loan to David Gregg and requested permission from Gregg to join his fight. Altogether, 3,250 Union troopers opposed Stuart. The other brigade from Kilpatrick's division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Elon J. Farnsworth, was stationed to the southwest of the Round Top mountain, the area now known informally as South Cavalry Field.<ref>Sears, p. 460; Wert, p. 256.</ref>\n\n===Principal commanders of cavalry at Gettysburg, July 3===\n<gallery>\nFile:J._Gurney_&_Son_-_J.E.B._Stuart.jpg|<center>Maj.

This was a foolish error because he also alerted Gregg to his presence. The brigades of McIntosh and Custer were positioned to block Stuart. As the Confederates approached, Gregg engaged them with an artillery duel and the superior skills of the Union horse artillerymen got the better of Stuart's guns.<ref>Sears, p. 460; Coddington, p. 521; Wert, p. 264.</ref>\n\nStuart's plan had been to pin down McIntosh's and Custer's skirmishers around the Rummel farm and swing over Cress Ridge, around the left flank of the defenders, but the Federal skirmish line pushed back tenaciously; the troopers from the [[5th Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment|5th Michigan Cavalry]] were armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, multiplying their firepower. Stuart decided on a direct cavalry charge to break their resistance. He ordered an assault by the [[1st Virginia Cavalry]], his own old regiment, now in Fitz Lee's brigade. The battle started in earnest at approximately 1:00 p.m., at the same time that Col. [[Edward Porter Alexander]]'s Confederate artillery barrage opened up on [[Cemetery Ridge]]. Fitz Lee's troopers came pouring through the farm of John Rummel, scattering the Union skirmish line.<ref>Longacre, p. 226; Sears, p. 461; Wert, p. 265.</ref>\n\nGregg ordered Custer to counterattack with the [[7th Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment|7th Michigan]]. Custer personally led the regiment, shouting \"Come on, you Wolverines!\". Waves of horsemen collided in furious fighting along the fence line on Rummel's farm. Seven hundred men fought at point-blank range across the fence with carbines, pistols and sabers. Custer's horse was shot out from under him, and he commandeered a bugler's horse. Eventually enough of Custer's men were amassed to break down the fence, and they caused the Virginians to retreat. Stuart sent in reinforcements from all three of his brigades: the 9th and [[13th Virginia Cavalry|13th Virginia]] (Chambliss' Brigade), the 1st North Carolina and Jeff Davis Legion (Hampton's) and squadrons from the 2nd Virginia (Lee's). Custer's pursuit was broken, and the 7th Michigan fell back in a disorderly retreat.<ref>Sears, p. 461; Wert, pp. 266-67.</ref>\n\nStuart tried again for a breakthrough by sending in the bulk of Wade Hampton's brigade, accelerating in formation from a walk to a gallop, sabers flashing, calling forth \"murmurs of admiration\" from their Union targets. Union [[U.S. Horse Artillery Brigade|horse artillery batteries]] attempted to block the advance with shell and canister, but the Confederates moved too quickly and were able to fill in for lost men, maintaining their momentum. Once again the cry \"Come on, you Wolverines!\" was heard as Custer and Col. [[Charles H. Town]] led the [[1st Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment|1st Michigan Cavalry]] into the fray, also at a gallop.<ref>Wert, pp. 268-69; Sears, pp. 461-62.</ref> A trooper from one of Gregg's Pennsylvania regiments observed,\n\n{{Quote|As the two columns approached each other the pace of each increased, when suddenly a crash, like the falling of timber, betokened the crisis. So sudden and violent was the collision that many of the horses were turned end over end and crushed their riders beneath them.<ref>Sears, p. 462.</ref>}}\n\nAs the horsemen fought desperately in the center, McIntosh personally led his brigade against Hampton's right flank and the 3rd Pennsylvania and 1st New Jersey hit Hampton's left from north of the Lott house. Hampton received a serious saber wound to the head; Custer lost his second horse of the day. Assaulted from three sides, the Confederates withdrew. The Union troopers were in no condition to pursue beyond the Rummel farmhouse.<ref>Sears, p. 462; Wert, p. 269.</ref>\n\nThe losses from the 40 intense minutes of fighting on East Cavalry Field were relatively minor: 254 Union casualties--219 of them from Custer's brigade--and 181 Confederate. Although tactically inconclusive, the battle was a strategic loss for Stuart and Robert E. Lee, whose plans to drive into the Union rear were foiled.<ref>Sears, p. 462; Wert, p. 271.</ref>\n\n==South Cavalry Field==\n[[File:Gettysburg South Cavalry Field.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Gettysburg South Cavalry Field]]\nOn the morning of July 3 Union Cavalry Corps commander Maj. Gen. [[Alfred Pleasonton]] ordered two of his brigades to the left flank of the Union army. He ordered Brig. Gen. [[Wesley Merritt]]'s Reserve Brigade of Buford's division to move north from Emmitsburg to join Brig. Gen. [[Judson Kilpatrick]]'s division, moving from Two Taverns on the Baltimore Pike to the area southwest of [[Big Round Top|Round Top]]. By this time the only brigade in Kilpatrick's division was that of Brig. Gen. [[Elon J. Farnsworth]], Custer's brigade having been detached for service with David Gregg at East Cavalry Field. It is unclear what Pleasonton hoped to accomplish. There is no record that he performed any reconnaissance in this area. It has been speculated that Army of the Potomac commander [[George G. Meade]] was preparing for a possible counterattack to follow the repulse of Pickett's Charge, which he had anticipated since the night before.<ref>Symonds, pp. 254-55; Sears, pp. 462-64; Coddington, pp. 523-25.</ref>\n\nFarnsworth reached the area at approximately 1:00 p.m., about the time the massive Confederate artillery barrage started in preparation for Pickett's Charge, and his 1,925 troops took up a position in a line south of the George Bushman farm. From left to right, the regiments were the 18th Pennsylvania Cavalry, the [[1st West Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment|1st West Virginia]] and 1st Vermont. Battery E, 4th U.S. Artillery, occupied a small, rocky knoll in the rear and the [[5th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry|5th New York cavalry]] was placed in a nearby ravine to guard the artillery. Joined by Kilpatrick, they awaited Merritt's brigade, which arrived at about 3:00 p.m. and took up a position straddling the Emmitsburg Road, to Farnsworth's left. By this time the infantry portion of Pickett's Charge had begun, and Kilpatrick was eager to get his men into the fight.<ref>Longacre, p. 240; Wert, pp. 272-73.</ref>\n\nOn the Confederate line to the east of the Emmitsburg Road, only infantry troops were involved. The four brigades of Hood's division, under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Evander M. Law]], had occupied the area from Round Top, through [[Devil's Den]] and back to the road since the battle on July 2. Initially, Law had just the 1st Texas Infantry (from Brig. Gen. [[Jerome B. Robertson]]'s [[Texas Brigade]]) facing Farnsworth to the south, but he soon reinforced them with the 47th Alabama Infantry, the 1st South Carolina and artillery. To the west of the road, facing Merritt, was the Georgia brigade of Brig. Gen. [[George T. Anderson|George \"Tige\" Anderson]].<ref>Wert, pp. 273-75.</ref>\n\nYoung Kilpatrick had little experience in commanding cavalry, and he demonstrated that by attacking fortified infantry positions in a piecemeal fashion. West of the road Merritt went in first, with his 6th Pennsylvania cavalrymen fighting dismounted. Anderson's Georgians repulsed their attack easily. Farnsworth was to follow, but he was astonished to hear Kilpatrick's order for a mounted cavalry charge. The Confederate defenders were positioned behind a stone fence with wooden fence rails piled high above it, too high for horses to jump, which would require the attackers to dismount under fire and dismantle the fence. The terrain leading to it was broken, undulating ground, with large boulders, fences and woodlots, making it unsuitable for a cavalry charge. Accounts differ as to the details of the argument between Farnsworth and Kilpatrick, but it is generally believed that Kilpatrick dared or shamed Farnsworth into making the charge the latter knew would be suicidal. Farnsworth allegedly said, \"General, if you order the charge I will lead it, but you must take the awful responsibility.\"<ref>Wert, p. 276.</ref>\n\nFirst in the assault was the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, led by Col. Nathaniel P. Richmond. They rode in great confusion after coming under heavy fire from the 1st Texas, but they were able to breach the wall. Hand-to-hand fighting with sabers, rifles and even rocks ensued, but the attack was forced back. Of the 400 Federal cavalrymen in the attack, there were 98 casualties. The second wave came from the 18th Pennsylvania, supported by companies of the 5th New York, but they were also turned back under heavy rifle fire, with 20 casualties.<ref>Longacre, pp. 241-42; Wert, pp. 276-77.</ref>\n\nIt was finally the turn of the 1st Vermont Cavalry, about 400 officers and men, which Farnsworth divided into three battalions of four companies each under Lt. Col. Addison W. Preston, Maj. [[William Wells (general)|William Wells]] and Capt. Henry C. Parsons. Parsons' battalion led the charge, passing the Texans and riding north toward the John Slyder farm. Evander Law sent three Georgia regiments (the 9th, 11th and 59th) to move to the support of the Texans and the artillery batteries. A staff officer carrying the order encountered the 4th Alabama, which also joined in support. An Alabama lieutenant yelled, \"Cavalry, boys, cavalry! This is no fight, only a frolic, give it to them!\" And the infantrymen found many easy targets.<ref>Longacre, p. 242; Wert, pp. 277-78; Sears, p. 464; Symonds, p. 255.</ref>\n\nAll three battalion advances were turned back with great losses. The final group, led by Wells and Farnsworth, circled back toward Big Round Top, where they met a line of the 15th Alabama across their front. Farnsworth's party had dwindled to only ten troopers as they weaved back and forth, trying to avoid the murderous fire. Farnsworth fell from his horse, struck in the chest, abdomen and leg by five bullets. Postwar accounts by a Confederate soldier who claimed Farnsworth committed suicide with his pistol to avoid capture have been discounted. Maj. Wells received the [[Medal of Honor]] for his heroism in leading the rest of his men back to safety. The Vermont regiment suffered 65 casualties during the futile assault.<ref>Symonds, p. 255; Trudeau, p. 519; Longacre, p. 243; Wert, pp. 279-80; Sears, p. 464; Parsons, Vol III, p. 396 (footnote) explains how the suicide accounts may have originated.</ref>\n\nKilpatrick's ill-considered and poorly executed cavalry charges are remembered as a low point in the history of the U.S. cavalry and marked the final significant hostilities at the Battle of Gettysburg. Six miles (10&nbsp;km) west of Gettysburg one of Merritt's regiments, the [[6th U.S. Cavalry]], was defeated that afternoon at [[Battle of Fairfield|Fairfield]] by Brig. Gen. [[William E. Jones|William E. \"Grumble\" Jones]]' \"Laurel Brigade,\" an action not considered to be a formal part of the Battle of Gettysburg but one that had a critical role in the [[Retreat from Gettysburg|retreat of Lee's army]].<ref>Pfanz, p. 52; Longacre, pp. 235-36; Wert, pp. 280-83.</ref>\n\nAll of Pleasonton's cavalry brigades were exercised for the remainder of the [[Gettysburg Campaign]] in the lackluster pursuit of Lee's army back across the [[Potomac River]].<ref>Pfanz, pp. 53-54; Sears, pp. 471-92; Coddington, pp. 537-72.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [[John B.

This was a foolish error because he also alerted Gregg to his presence. The brigades of McIntosh and Custer were positioned to block Stuart. As the Confederates approached, Gregg engaged them with an artillery duel and the superior skills of the Union horse artillerymen got the better of Stuart's guns.<ref>Sears, p. 460; Coddington, p. 521; Wert, p. 264.</ref>\n\nStuart's plan had been to pin down McIntosh's and Custer's skirmishers around the Rummel farm and swing over Cress Ridge, around the left flank of the defenders, but the Federal skirmish line pushed back tenaciously; the troopers from the [[5th Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment|5th Michigan Cavalry]] were armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, multiplying their firepower. Stuart decided on a direct cavalry charge to break their resistance. He ordered an assault by the [[1st Virginia Cavalry]], his own old regiment, now in Fitz Lee's brigade. The battle started in earnest at approximately 1:00 p.m., at the same time that Col. [[Edward Porter Alexander]]'s Confederate artillery barrage opened up on [[Cemetery Ridge]]. Fitz Lee's troopers came pouring through the farm of John Rummel, scattering the Union skirmish line.<ref>Longacre, p. 226; Sears, p. 461; Wert, p. 265.</ref>\n\nGregg ordered Custer to counterattack with the [[7th Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment|7th Michigan]]. Custer personally led the regiment, shouting \"Come on, you Wolverines!\". Waves of horsemen collided in furious fighting along the fence line on Rummel's farm. Seven hundred men fought at point-blank range across the fence with carbines, pistols and sabers. Custer's horse was shot out from under him, and he commandeered a bugler's horse. Eventually enough of Custer's men were amassed to break down the fence, and they caused the Virginians to retreat. Stuart sent in reinforcements from all three of his brigades: the 9th and [[13th Virginia Cavalry|13th Virginia]] (Chambliss' Brigade), the 1st North Carolina and Jeff Davis Legion (Hampton's) and squadrons from the 2nd Virginia (Lee's). Custer's pursuit was broken, and the 7th Michigan fell back in a disorderly retreat.<ref>Sears, p. 461; Wert, pp. 266-67.</ref>\n\nStuart tried again for a breakthrough by sending in the bulk of Wade Hampton's brigade, accelerating in formation from a walk to a gallop, sabers flashing, calling forth \"murmurs of admiration\" from their Union targets. Union [[U.S. Horse Artillery Brigade|horse artillery batteries]] attempted to block the advance with shell and canister, but the Confederates moved too quickly and were able to fill in for lost men, maintaining their momentum. Once again the cry \"Come on, you Wolverines!\" was heard as Custer and Col. [[Charles H. Town]] led the [[1st Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment|1st Michigan Cavalry]] into the fray, also at a gallop.<ref>Wert, pp. 268-69; Sears, pp. 461-62.</ref> A trooper from one of Gregg's Pennsylvania regiments observed,\n\n{{Quote|As the two columns approached each other the pace of each increased, when suddenly a crash, like the falling of timber, betokened the crisis. So sudden and violent was the collision that many of the horses were turned end over end and crushed their riders beneath them.<ref>Sears, p. 462.</ref>}}\n\nAs the horsemen fought desperately in the center, McIntosh personally led his brigade against Hampton's right flank and the 3rd Pennsylvania and 1st New Jersey hit Hampton's left from north of the Lott house. Hampton received a serious saber wound to the head; Custer lost his second horse of the day. Assaulted from three sides, the Confederates withdrew. The Union troopers were in no condition to pursue beyond the Rummel farmhouse.<ref>Sears, p. 462; Wert, p. 269.</ref>\n\nThe losses from the 40 intense minutes of fighting on East Cavalry Field were relatively minor: 254 Union casualties--219 of them from Custer's brigade--and 181 Confederate. Although tactically inconclusive, the battle was a strategic loss for Stuart and Robert E. Lee, whose plans to drive into the Union rear were foiled.<ref>Sears, p. 462; Wert, p. 271.</ref>\n\n==South Cavalry Field==\n[[File:Gettysburg South Cavalry Field.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Gettysburg South Cavalry Field]]\nOn the morning of July 3 Union Cavalry Corps commander Maj. Gen. [[Alfred Pleasonton]] ordered two of his brigades to the left flank of the Union army. He ordered Brig. Gen. [[Wesley Merritt]]'s Reserve Brigade of Buford's division to move north from Emmitsburg to join Brig. Gen. [[Judson Kilpatrick]]'s division, moving from Two Taverns on the Baltimore Pike to the area southwest of [[Big Round Top|Round Top]]. By this time the only brigade in Kilpatrick's division was that of Brig. Gen. [[Elon J. Farnsworth]], Custer's brigade having been detached for service with David Gregg at East Cavalry Field. It is unclear what Pleasonton hoped to accomplish. There is no record that he performed any reconnaissance in this area. It has been speculated that Army of the Potomac commander [[George G. Meade]] was preparing for a possible counterattack to follow the repulse of Pickett's Charge, which he had anticipated since the night before.<ref>Symonds, pp. 254-55; Sears, pp. 462-64; Coddington, pp. 523-25.</ref>\n\nFarnsworth reached the area at approximately 1:00 p.m., about the time the massive Confederate artillery barrage started in preparation for Pickett's Charge, and his 1,925 troops took up a position in a line south of the George Bushman farm. From left to right, the regiments were the 18th Pennsylvania Cavalry, the [[1st West Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment|1st West Virginia]] and 1st Vermont. Battery E, 4th U.S. Artillery, occupied a small, rocky knoll in the rear and the [[5th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry|5th New York cavalry]] was placed in a nearby ravine to guard the artillery. Joined by Kilpatrick, they awaited Merritt's brigade, which arrived at about 3:00 p.m. and took up a position straddling the Emmitsburg Road, to Farnsworth's left. By this time the infantry portion of Pickett's Charge had begun, and Kilpatrick was eager to get his men into the fight.<ref>Longacre, p. 240; Wert, pp. 272-73.</ref>\n\nOn the Confederate line to the east of the Emmitsburg Road, only infantry troops were involved. The four brigades of Hood's division, under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Evander M. Law]], had occupied the area from Round Top, through [[Devil's Den]] and back to the road since the battle on July 2. Initially, Law had just the 1st Texas Infantry (from Brig. Gen. [[Jerome B. Robertson]]'s [[Texas Brigade]]) facing Farnsworth to the south, but he soon reinforced them with the 47th Alabama Infantry, the 1st South Carolina and artillery. To the west of the road, facing Merritt, was the Georgia brigade of Brig. Gen. [[George T. Anderson|George \"Tige\" Anderson]].<ref>Wert, pp. 273-75.</ref>\n\nYoung Kilpatrick had little experience in commanding cavalry, and he demonstrated that by attacking fortified infantry positions in a piecemeal fashion. West of the road Merritt went in first, with his 6th Pennsylvania cavalrymen fighting dismounted. Anderson's Georgians repulsed their attack easily. Farnsworth was to follow, but he was astonished to hear Kilpatrick's order for a mounted cavalry charge. The Confederate defenders were positioned behind a stone fence with wooden fence rails piled high above it, too high for horses to jump, which would require the attackers to dismount under fire and dismantle the fence. The terrain leading to it was broken, undulating ground, with large boulders, fences and woodlots, making it unsuitable for a cavalry charge. Accounts differ as to the details of the argument between Farnsworth and Kilpatrick, but it is generally believed that Kilpatrick dared or shamed Farnsworth into making the charge the latter knew would be suicidal. Farnsworth allegedly said, \"General, if you order the charge I will lead it, but you must take the awful responsibility.\"<ref>Wert, p. 276.</ref>\n\nFirst in the assault was the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, led by Col. Nathaniel P. Richmond. They rode in great confusion after coming under heavy fire from the 1st Texas, but they were able to breach the wall. Hand-to-hand fighting with sabers, rifles and even rocks ensued, but the attack was forced back. Of the 400 Federal cavalrymen in the attack, there were 98 casualties. The second wave came from the 18th Pennsylvania, supported by companies of the 5th New York, but they were also turned back under heavy rifle fire, with 20 casualties.<ref>Longacre, pp. 241-42; Wert, pp. 276-77.</ref>\n\nIt was finally the turn of the 1st Vermont Cavalry, about 400 officers and men, which Farnsworth divided into three battalions of four companies each under Lt. Col. Addison W. Preston, Maj. [[William Wells (general)|William Wells]] and Capt. Henry C. Parsons. Parsons' battalion led the charge, passing the Texans and riding north toward the John Slyder farm. Evander Law sent three Georgia regiments (the 9th, 11th and 59th) to move to the support of the Texans and the artillery batteries. A staff officer carrying the order encountered the 4th Alabama, which also joined in support. An Alabama lieutenant yelled, \"Cavalry, boys, cavalry! This is no fight, only a frolic, give it to them!\" And the infantrymen found many easy targets.<ref>Longacre, p. 242; Wert, pp. 277-78; Sears, p. 464; Symonds, p. 255.</ref>\n\nAll three battalion advances were turned back with great losses. The final group, led by Wells and Farnsworth, circled back toward Big Round Top, where they met a line of the 15th Alabama across their front. Farnsworth's party had dwindled to only ten troopers as they weaved back and forth, trying to avoid the murderous fire. Farnsworth fell from his horse, struck in the chest, abdomen and leg by five bullets. Postwar accounts by a Confederate soldier who claimed Farnsworth committed suicide with his pistol to avoid capture have been discounted. Maj. Wells received the [[Medal of Honor]] for his heroism in leading the rest of his men back to safety. The Vermont regiment suffered 65 casualties during the futile assault.<ref>Symonds, p. 255; Trudeau, p. 519; Longacre, p. 243; Wert, pp. 279-80; Sears, p. 464; Parsons, Vol III, p. 396 (footnote) explains how the suicide accounts may have originated.</ref>\n\nKilpatrick's ill-considered and poorly executed cavalry charges are remembered as a low point in the history of the U.S. cavalry and marked the final significant hostilities at the Battle of Gettysburg. Six miles (10&nbsp;km) west of Gettysburg one of Merritt's regiments, the [[6th U.S. Cavalry]], was defeated that afternoon at [[Battle of Fairfield|Fairfield]] by Brig. Gen. [[William E. Jones|William E. \"Grumble\" Jones]]' \"Laurel Brigade,\" an action not considered to be a formal part of the Battle of Gettysburg but one that had a critical role in the [[Retreat from Gettysburg|retreat of Lee's army]].<ref>Pfanz, p. 52; Longacre, pp. 235-36; Wert, pp. 280-83.</ref>\n\nAll of Pleasonton's cavalry brigades were exercised for the remainder of the [[Gettysburg Campaign]] in the lackluster pursuit of Lee's army back across the [[Potomac River]].<ref>Pfanz, pp. 53-54; Sears, pp. 471-92; Coddington, pp. 537-72.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [[John B.

Spain's mineral wealth and access to metals made it an important source of raw material during the early metal ages. Carthage conquered parts of Iberia after the First Punic War. After defeating Carthage in the [[Second Punic War]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] governed all of the Iberian Peninsula for centuries, expanding and diversifying the economy and extending Hispanic trade with the greater Republic and Empire.\n\n==Middle Ages==\nWhile most of western Europe fell into a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age]] after the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], those kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula that today are known as Spain maintained their economy.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} First, the [[Visigoths]] replaced the Roman imperial administrators (an international class at the top echelons). They established themselves as nobility. The kingdom had some degree of centralized power at their capital, which was eventually moved to Toledo from Toulouse. The Roman municipal and provincial governorships continued but the imperial superstructure of diocese and prefecture was of course completely gone as there was no need for it: these had existed to coordinate imperial defense and provide uniform administrative oversight, and symbolized as nothing else, except the professional army, the presence of the Roman. Though it suffered some decline, most Roman law and much physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, aqueducts and irrigation systems, was maintained to varying degrees unlike the complete disintegration that occurred in most other former parts of the western empire with the exception of parts of Italy. Later, when the [[Moors]] occupied large parts of the Iberian Peninsula alongside the Catholic kingdoms, they also maintained much of this Roman legacy; in fact as time went on they had Roman infrastructure repaired and extended. Meanwhile, in the countryside, where most people had always lived, life went on much as it had in Roman times, but with improvements due to the repair and extension of irrigation systems, and the introduction of novel crops and agricultural practices from the Islamic world. While trade dwindled in most of the former Roman lands in Europe, trade survived to some degree in Visigothic Spain, and flourished under the Moors through the integration of [[Al-Andalus]] (Moorish Spain) with the Mediterranean trade of the Islamic world. After [[Reconquista|800 years of intermittent warring]], the Catholic kingdoms had gradually become more powerful and sophisticated and eventually expelled all the Moors from the Peninsula.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Castile]], united with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], had merchant navies that rivaled that of the [[Hanseatic League]] and [[Venice]]. Like the rest of late medieval Europe, restrictive guilds closely regulated all aspects of the economy-production, trade, and even transport. The most powerful of these corporations, the ''[[mesta]]'', controlled the production of wool, Castile's chief export.\n\n==Dynastic union and exploration==\nThe Reconquista allowed the [[Catholic Monarchs]] to divert their attention to exploration. In 1492, [[Pope Alexander VI]] (Rodrigo Borgia, a Valencian) formally approved the division of the unexplored world between kingdoms of what is today Spain and Portugal. New discoveries and conquests came in quick succession.\n\nIn 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus]] brought 1,500 colonists with him on his second voyage, a royal administrator had already been appointed for what the Catholic kingdoms referred to as the Indies. The Council of the Indies (''[[Consejo de Indias]]''), established in 1524 acted as an advisory board on colonial affairs, and the House of Trade (''[[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]]'') regulated trade with the colonies.\n\n===Gold and silver from the New World===\n{{main|Spanish Empire|Iberian Union}}\n{{See also|School of Salamanca}}\n[[File:La sevilla del sigloXVI.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|The port of [[Seville]] in the 1500s. Originally, all trade with the colonies in the Americas was required to go through this port.]]\nFollowing the discovery of America and the colonial expansion in the [[Spanish West Indies|Caribbean]] and [[Spanish Main|Continental America]], valuable agricultural products and mineral resources were introduced into Spain through regular [[Spanish treasure fleet|trade routes]]. New products such as potatoes, tomatoes and corn had a long-lasting impact on the Spanish economy, but more importantly on European demographics. Gold and silver bullion from American mines were used by the Spanish Crown to pay for troops in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Italy]], to maintain the emperor's forces in Germany and ships at sea, and to satisfy increasing consumer demand at home. However, the large volumes of precious metals from America led to inflation, which had a negative effect on the poorer part of the population, as goods became overpriced. This also hampered exports, as expensive goods could not compete in international markets. Moreover, the large cash inflows from silver hindered the industrial development in Spain as entrepreneurship seems to be indispensable.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=159|isbn=9781107507180}}</ref>\n\nDomestic production was heavily taxed, driving up prices for Aragon and Castile-made goods, but especially in Castile where the tax burden was greater. The sale of titles to entrepreneurs who bought their way up the social ladder (a practice commonly found all over Europe), removing themselves from the productive sector of the economy, provided additional funds.\n\nThe overall effect of plague and emigration reduced peninsular Spain's population from over 8 million in the last years of the 16th century to under 7 million by the mid-17th century, with Castile the most severely affected region (85% of the Kingdom's population were in Castile), as an example, in 1500, Castile 6 million, and 1.25 million in the Kingdom of Aragon which included Catalonia, Valencian and the Balearic Islands.\n\n==Decline relative to Britain==\nThe Spanish economy diverged from the British economy in terms of GDP during the middle of the seventeenth century. The explanations for this divergence are unclear, but \"the divergence comes too late to have any medieval origins, whether cultural or institutional\" and \"it comes too early...  in order for the Napoleonic Invasions to be blamed.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Santiago Caballero|first=Carlos|last2=Palma|first2=Nuno|date=2019-11-18|title=Patterns of Iberian economic growth in the early modern period|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/cte/whrepe/29185.html|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Bourbon reforms==\nA slow economic recovery began in the last decades of the 17th century under the Habsburgs. Under the Bourbons, government efficiency was improved, especially under [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]]'s reign. The Bourbon reforms, however, resulted in no basic changes in the pattern of property holding. The nature of bourgeois class consciousness in Aragon and Castile hindered the creation of a middle-class movement. At the instance of liberal thinkers including [[Pedro Rodr\u00edguez de Campomanes|Campomanes]], various groups known as \"Economic Societies of friends of the Country\" were formed to promote economic development, new advances in the sciences, and Enlightenment philosophy (see ''[[Sociedad Econ\u00f3mica de los Amigos del Pa\u00eds]]''). However, despite the development of a national bureaucracy in Madrid, the reform movement could not be sustained without the patronage of Charles III, and it did not survive him.\n\nJan Bergeyck (advisor to Philip V) \"Disorder I have found here is beyond all imagination\".\nCastile's exchequer still used Roman numerals and there was no proper accounting.<ref>Henry Kamen the war of succession in spain</ref>\n\n==Napoleon and the War of Independence==\nSpain's American colonies took advantage of the postwar chaos to proclaim their independence. By 1825 only [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] remained under the Spanish flag in the New World. When [[Ferdinand VII]] was restored to the throne in 1813 and expended wealth and manpower in a vain effort to reassert control over the colonies. The move was unpopular among liberal officers assigned to the American wars.\n\n==1822 to 1898==\nThe economy was heavily focused around agricultural goods. The period saw regional industrialization in Catalonia and the Basque Country and the construction of railways in the second half of the nineteenth century helped alleviate some of the isolation of the interior but generally little changed for much of the country as political instability, uprisings and unstable governments slowed or undermined economic progress.\n\n==1898 to 1920==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Spain was still mostly rural; modern industry existed only in the textile mills around Barcelona in Catalonia and in the metallurgical plants of the Basque provinces.  The loss of Cuba and the Philippines benefited the Peninsula by causing capital to return and to be invested in updated domestic industries. But even with the  stimulus of World War I, only in [[Catalonia]] and in two Basque provinces ([[Biscay]] and [[Guipuscoa]]) did the value of manufacturing output in 1920 exceed that of agricultural production. Agricultural productivity was generally low compared with that of other West European countries because of a number of deficiencies: backward technology, lack of large irrigation projects, inadequate rural credit facilities, outmoded landtenure practices, as well as the age old problems of difficult terrain, unreliable climate, isolation and difficult transportation in the rugged interior. Financial institutions were relatively undeveloped. The [[Bank of Spain]] (''Banco de Espa\u00f1a'') was still privately owned, and its public functions were restricted to currency issuance and the provision of funds for state activities. The state largely limited itself to such traditional activities as defense and the maintenance of order and justice. Road building, education, and a few welfare activities were the only public services that had any appreciable impact on the economy.\n\n==Primo de Rivera==\nA General, [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]], was appointed prime minister by the king after a successful coup d'\u00e9tat and for seven years dissolved parliament and ruled through directorates and the aid of the military until 1930.\n\nProtectionism, the Spanish neutrality during [[World War I]] (which allowed the country to trade with all belligerents) and state control of the economy led to a temporary economic recovery. The precipitous economic decline in 1930 undercut support for the government from special-interest groups. Criticism from academics mounted. Bankers expressed disappointment at the state loans that his government had tried to float. An attempt to reform the promotion system cost him the support of the army and, in turn, the support of the king. Primo de Rivera resigned and died shortly afterward in exile.\n\n==Second Republic, 1931\u201336==\nThe republican government substituted the monarchy and inherited the international economic crisis as well. Three different governments ruled during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], failing to execute numerous reforms, including land reform. General strikes were common and the economy stagnated.\n\nDuring the [[Spanish Civil War]], the country split into two different centralized economies, and the whole economic effort was redirected to the war industry. According to recent research,<ref>Weinstein, J and Imai, K.

[[Gold]] and [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] reserves had been virtually wiped out, the massive devastation of war had reduced the productive capacity of both industry and [[Agriculture in Spain|agriculture]]. To compound the difficulties, even if the wherewithal had existed to purchase imports, the outbreak of [[World War II]] rendered many needed supplies unavailable. The end of the war did not improve Spain's plight because of subsequent global shortages of raw materials, and peacetime industrial products. Spain's European neighbours faced formidable post-war reconstruction problems of their own, and, because of their awareness that the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War had been achieved with the help of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]], they had no inclination to include Spain in any multilateral recovery programs or trade. For a decade following the Civil War's end in 1939, the wrecked and isolated economy remained in a state of severe [[depression (economics)|depression]].<ref name=\"countrystudy\">{{cite book |last1=Solsten |first1=Eric |last2=Meditz |first2=Sandra |title=Spain: a country study |date=1988 |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |location=Washington, D.C. |url=https://cdn.loc.gov/master/frd/frdcstdy/sp/spaincountrystud00sols_0/spaincountrystud00sols_0.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBranded an international outcast for its pro-[[Axis Powers|Axis]] bias during World War II, Spain was not invited to join the [[Marshall Plan]]. [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime sought to provide for Spain's well-being by adopting a policy of economic self-sufficiency. [[Autarky]] was not merely a reaction to [[international isolation]]; it was also rooted in more than half a century of advocacy from domestic economic pressure groups. Furthermore, from 1939 to 1945, Spain's military chiefs genuinely feared an Allied invasion of the Peninsula and, therefore, sought to avert excessive reliance on foreign armaments.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nWith the war devastation and trade isolation, Spain was much more economically backward in the 1940s than it had been a decade earlier. Inflation soared, [[economic reconstruction]] faltered, food was scarce, and, in some years, Spain registered negative growth rates. By the early 1950s, per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) was barely 40% of the average for West European countries. Then, after a decade of economic stagnation, a tripling of prices, the growth of a [[black market]], and widespread deprivation, gradual improvement began to take place. The regime took its first faltering steps toward abandoning its pretensions of self-sufficiency and towards a transformation of Spain's economic system. Pre-Civil War industrial production levels were regained in the early 1950s, though agricultural output remained below prewar levels until 1958.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nA further impetus to economic liberalization came from the September 1953 signing of a mutual defense agreement, the [[Pact of Madrid]], between the [[United States]] and Spain. In return for permitting the establishment of United States military bases on Spanish soil, the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] administration provided substantial economic aid to the Franco regime. More than US$1 billion in economic assistance flowed into Spain during the remainder of the decade as a result of the agreement. Between 1953 and 1958, Spain's [[gross national product]] (GNP) rose by about 5% per annum.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nThe years from 1951 to 1956 were marked by much economic progress, but the reforms of the period were implemented irregularly, and were poorly coordinated. One large obstacle to the reform process was the corrupt, inefficient, and bloated bureaucracy. By the mid-1950s, the inflationary spiral had resumed its upward climb, and foreign currency reserves that had stood at US$58 million in 1958 plummeted to US$6 million by mid-1959. The growing demands of the emerging middle class\u2014and of the ever-greater number of tourists\u2014for the amenities of life, particularly for higher nutritional standards, placed heavy demands on imported food and luxury items. At the same time, exports lagged, largely because of high domestic demand and institutional restraints on foreign trade. The [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] fell to an all-time low on the black market, and Spain's foreign currency obligations grew to almost US$60 million.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nA debate took place within the regime over strategies for extricating the country from its economic impasse, and Franco finally opted in favor of a group of [[neoliberals]]. The group included bankers, industrial executives, some academic economists, and members of the [[Roman Catholic]] lay organization, [[Opus Dei]].<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nDuring the 1957-59 period, known as the pre-stabilization years, economic planners contented themselves with piecemeal measures such as moderate anti-inflationary stopgaps and increases in Spain's links with the world economy. A combination of external developments and an increasingly aggravated domestic economic crisis, however, forced them to engage in more far-reaching changes.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nAs the need for a change in economic policy became manifest in the late 1950s, an overhaul of the Council of Ministers in February 1957 brought to the key ministries a group of younger men, most of whom possessed economics training and experience. This reorganization was quickly followed by the establishment of a committee on economic affairs and the Office of Economic Coordination and Planning under the prime minister.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nSuch administrative changes were important steps in eliminating the chronic rivalries that existed among economic ministries. Other reforms followed, the principal one being the adoption of a corporate tax system that required the confederation of each industrial sector to allocate an appropriate share of the entire industry's tax assessment to each member firm. Chronic tax evasion was consequently made more difficult, and tax collection receipts rose sharply. Together with curbs on government spending, in 1958 this reform created the first government surplus in many years.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nMore drastic remedies were required as Spain's isolation from the rest of Western Europe became exacerbated. Neighboring states were in the process of establishing the EC and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA\u2014see Glossary). In the process of liberalizing trade among their members, these organizations found it difficult to establish economic relations with countries wedded to trade quotas and bilateral agreements, such as Spain.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\n===The \"Spanish Miracle\"===\n\nSpanish membership in these groups was not politically possible, but Spain was invited to join a number of other international institutions. In January 1958, Spain became an associate member of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), which became the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in September 1961. In 1959 Spain joined the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]]. These bodies immediately became involved in helping Spain to abandon the autarkical trade practices that had brought its reserves to such low levels and that were isolating its economy from the rest of Europe.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n[[File:Soviet Union USSR GDP per capita.png|thumb|right|GDP per capita of Spain from 1913 to 1990.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maddison |first1=Angus |title=The world economy |date=2006 |publisher=Development Centre of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) |location=Paris, France |isbn=978-92-64-02261-4 |pages=400-600 |url=https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/world_economy.pdf}}</ref>]]\nIn December 1958, after seven months of preparation and drafting, aided by IMF, Spain unveiled its Stabilization Plan on June 30, 1959. The plan's objectives were twofold: to take the necessary fiscal and monetary measures required to restrict demand and to contain inflation, while, at the same time, liberalizing foreign trade and encouraging foreign investment. The plan's initial effect was deflationary and recessionary, leading to a drop in real income and to a rise in unemployment during its first year. The resultant economic slump and reduced wages led approximately 500,000 Spanish workers to emigrate in search of better job opportunities in other West European countries. Nonetheless, its main goals were achieved. The plan enabled Spain to avert a possible suspension of payments abroad to foreign banks holding Spanish currency, and by the close of 1959, Spain's foreign exchange account showed a US$100-million surplus. Foreign capital investment grew sevenfold between 1958 and 1960, and the annual influx of tourists began to rise rapidly, bringing in very much needed foreign exchange along remittances from Spanish workers abroad.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n[[File:Playa de Benidorm. Alicante (18300025123).jpg|thumb|right|Beach in Benidorm circa 1960]]\nAs these developments steadily converted Spain's economic structure into one more closely resembling a [[free-market economy]], the country entered the greatest cycle of industrialization and prosperity it had ever known. Foreign aid took the form of US$75 million in drawing rights from the IMF, US$100 million in OEEC credits, US$70 million in commercial credits from the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] and the [[First National City Bank]], US$30 million from the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States]], and funds from United States aid programs. Total foreign backing amounted to US$420 million. The principal lubricants of the economic expansion, however, were the hard currency [[remittances]] of one million Spanish workers abroad, which are estimated to have offset 17.9% of the total trade deficit from 1962 to 1971; the gigantic increase in tourism that drew more than 20 million visitors per year by the end of the 1960s, accounting by then for 9% of GNP; a car industry that grew at a staggering compound rate of 21.7% per year from 1958 to 1972; and direct foreign investment, which between 1960 and 1974 amounted to an impressive US$7.6 billion. More than 40% of this investment came from the United States, almost 17% came from [[Switzerland]], and the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] and France each accounted for slightly more than 10%. By 1975 foreign capital represented 12.4% of the total invested in Spain's 500 largest industrial firms. More important than the actual size of the foreign investment was the access it gave Spanish companies to up to date technology. An additional billion dollars came from foreign sources through a variety of loans and credit devices.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>[[File:Seat 850 Sport Jarama 2006.JPG|right|thumb|[[SEAT 850|SEAT 850 Sport]], 1967. SEAT became a symbol of the \"Spanish Miracle\", 1959\u20131974.]]\n\nTo help achieve rapid development, there was massive government investment through key state-owned companies like the national industrial conglomerate [[Instituto Nacional de Industria]], the mass-market car company [[SEAT]] in [[Barcelona]], the shipbuilder [[Navantia|Empresa Nacional Baz\u00e1n]]. With foreign access to the Spanish domestic market restricted by heavy tariffs and quotas, these national companies led the industrialisation of the country, restoring the prosperity of old industrial areas like Barcelona and [[Bilbao]] and creating new industrial areas, most notably around [[Madrid]]. Although there was considerable economic liberalisation in the period these enterprises remained under state control.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nThe success of the stabilization program was attributable to a combination of good luck and good management and the impressive development during this period was referred to as the \"[[Spanish miracle]]\". Between 1959 and 1974, Spain had the next fastest economic growth rate after [[Japan]]. The boom came to an end with the [[1970s energy crisis|oil shocks]] of the 1970s and government instability during the transition back to democracy after Franco's death in 1975.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\n==The Post-Franco period, 1975\u20131980s==\n{{One source section|date=March 2020}}\nFranco's death in 1975 and the ensuing [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democratic rule]] diverted Spaniards' attention from their economy. The return to democracy coincided with an [[1979 energy crisis|explosive quadrupling of oil prices]], which had an extremely serious effect on the economy because Spain imported 70% of its energy, mostly in the form of [[Middle Eastern]] oil. Nonetheless, the interim centrist government of [[Adolfo Suarez Gonzalez]], which had been named to succeed the Franco regime by [[King Juan Carlos]], did little to shore up the economy or even to reduce Spain's dependence on imported oil, although there was little that could be done as the country had little in the way of hydrocarbon deposits. A virtually exclusive preoccupation with the politics of democratization during the politically and socially unstable period when the new constitution was drafted and enacted, absorbed most of Spain's politics and administration at the expense of economic policy.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nBecause of the failure to adjust to the changed economic environment brought on by the two oil price shocks of the 1970s, Spain quickly confronted plummeting productivity, an explosive increase in wages from 1974 to 1976, a reversal of migration trends as a result of the economic slump throughout Western Europe, and the steady outflow of labor from agricultural areas despite declining job prospects in the cities. All these factors contributed to a sharp rise in the unemployment rate. Government budgetary deficits swelled, as did large [[social security]] cost overruns and the huge operating losses incurred by a number of public-sector industries. Energy consumption, meanwhile, remained high.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nWhen the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] government headed by [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] took office in late 1982, inflation was running at an annual rate of 16%, the external current account was US$4 billion in arrears, public spending was large, and [[foreign exchange reserves]] had become dangerously depleted. In coping with the situation, however, the Gonzalez government had one asset that no previous post-Franco government had enjoyed, namely, a solid parliamentary majority in both houses of the Cortes (Spanish Parliament). With this majority, it was able to undertake unpopular austerity measures that earlier governments had not.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nThe Socialist government opted for pragmatic, orthodox monetary and fiscal policies, together with a series of vigorous retrenchment measures. In 1983 it unveiled a program that provided a more coherent and long-term approach to the country's economic ills. Renovative structural policies\u2014such as the closing of large, unprofitable state enterprises\u2014helped to correct the relatively poor performance of the economy. The government launched an industrial reconversion program, brought the problem-ridden social security system into better balance, and introduced a more efficient energy-use policy. [[Labour market flexibility|Labor market flexibility]] was improved, and private capital investment was encouraged with incentives.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nBy 1985 the budgetary deficit was brought down to 5% of GNP, and it dropped to 4.5% in 1986. Real wage growth was contained, and it was generally kept below the rate of inflation. Inflation was reduced to 4.5% in 1987, and analysts believed it might decrease to the government's goal of 3% in 1988.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nEfforts to modernize and to expand the economy together with a number of factors fostered strong economic growth in the 1980s. Those factors were the continuing fall in oil prices, increased tourism, and a massive upsurge in the inflow of foreign investment. Thus, despite the fact that the economy was being exposed to foreign competition in accordance with EC requirements, the Spanish economy underwent rapid expansion without experiencing balance of payments' constraints.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nIn the words of the OECD's 1987-88 survey of the Spanish economy, \"following a protracted period of sluggish growth with slow progress in winding down inflation during the late 1970s and the first half of the 1980s, the Spanish economy has entered a phase of vigorous expansion of output and employment accompanied by a marked slowdown of inflation.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=OECD Economic Surveys: Spain 1988OECD Economic Surveys: Spain 1988|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/economics/oecd-economic-surveys-spain-1988_eco_surveys-esp-1988-en|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development|accessdate=29 January 2013}}</ref>  In 1981 Spain's GDP growth rate had reached a nadir by registering a rate of negative 0.2%; it then gradually resumed its slow upward ascent with increases of 1.2% in 1982, 1.8% in 1983, 1.9% in 1984, and 2.1% in 1985. The following year, however, Spain's real GDP began to grow strongly, registering a growth rate of 3.3% in 1986 and 5.5% in 1987. Although these growth rates were less than those of the economic miracle years, they were among the strongest of the OECD. Analysts projected a rise of 3.8% in 1988 and of 3.5% in 1989, a slight decline but still roughly double the EC average. They expected that declining interest rates and the government's stimulative budget would help sustain economic expansion. Industrial output, which rose by 3.1% in 1986 and by 5.2% in 1987, was also expected to maintain its expansive rate, growing by 3.8% in 1988 and by 3.7% in 1989.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nA prime force generating rapid economic growth was increased domestic demand, which grew by a steep 6% in 1986 and by 4.8% in 1987, in both years exceeding official projections. During 1988 and 1989, analysts expected demand to remain strong, though at slightly lower levels. Much of the large increase in demand was met in 1987 by an estimated 20% jump in real terms in imports of goods and services.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Spain achieved a strong level of economic performance while simultaneously lowering its rate of inflation to within two points of the EC average. However, its export performance, though increasing, raised concerns over the existing imbalance between import and export growth.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\n==European integration, 1985\u20132000==\n[[File:Torre Mapfre y Hotel Ars.jpg|280px|thumb|left|View of the [[Torre Mapfre]] and [[Hotel Arts]] ([[Barcelona]]) built in 1992.]]\nAfter Franco's death in 1975, the country returned to democracy in the form of a constitutional monarchy in 1978, with elections being held in 1977 and with the constitution being ratified in 1978. The move to democracy saw Spain become more involved with the [[European integration]].\n\n[[Felipe Gonzalez]] became prime minister when his Socialist Party won the 1982 elections. He enacted a number of liberal reforms, increasing civil liberties and implementing universal free education for those 16 and younger. He also lobbied successfully for Spain to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and to remain part of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]].\n\nThe [[European Union]] at the time Spain joined, in 1986, existed primarily as a trading union - the EEC, and better trade links were vital to the fragile Spanish economy. Unemployment was high, about 18 percent, and the Spanish GDP was 71 percent of the EU average. The single market and European funding offered a chance to bring the Spanish economy up to the standards of the rest of Western Europe, along with the support of Spain's wealthier neighbors. There was the promise of lucrative deals with influential countries such as Germany, France and the UK.\n\nAlthough the Spanish Miracle years (1959\u20131974) witnessed unprecedented improvements in infrastructure and social services, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe. Education was limited, women were largely excluded from the workforce, health care was largely private and unevenly distributed and the country's infrastructure was relatively poor. In 1985, Spain had only {{convert|1,300|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of motorways. Since the end of the economic miracle in 1974, the country's economy had been stagnant. Joining the European Economic Community was perceived by most of the population as a way to restart the process of modernization and improvement of the population's average purchasing power.\n\nSpain joined the [[European Economic Community]], as the [[European Union]] was then known, in January 1986 at the same time as neighbor [[Portugal]]. Membership ushered the country into opening its economy, modernizing its industrial base and revising economic legislation to open its previously protected markets to foreign competition. With help of EU funds ([[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds]], [[European Regional Development Fund]], etc.) Spain greatly improved infrastructures, increased GDP growth, reduced the [[public debt]] to GDP ratio.\nSpain has been a driving force in the European community ever since. The country was a leading proponent of the EU single currency, the [[euro]], long before it had been put into circulation. Together with the other founding euro members, it adopted the new physical currency on January 1, 2002. On that date Spain terminated its historic [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] currency and replaced it with the [[euro]], which has become its national currency shared the rest of the [[Eurozone]]. This culminated a fast process of economic modernization even though the strength of the euro since its adoption has raised concerns regarding the fact that Spanish exports outside the European Union are being priced out of the range of foreign buyers, with the country losing [[monetary sovereignty]] in favour of the [[European Central Bank]], which must look after several different -often opposed- national interests.\n\nIn the early 1990s Spain, like most other countries, was hit by the [[early 1990s recession]]. which coincided with the end of the construction push put in place for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympics]].\n\n==Boom 1997\u20132007 ==\n[[File:Talgo 350.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Talgo 350]] high-speed service, [[Madrid]] - [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]]]\n\nThe country was confronted with very high unemployment, entrenched by its then rigid labour market. However the economy began to recover during the first [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar]] administration (1996-2000), driven by a return of consumer confidence, increased private consumption and liberalization and deregulation reforms aiming to reduce the State's role in the market place. Unemployment at 7.6% (October 2006), represented a significant improvement from the 1980s levels and a better rate than the one of Germany or France at the time. Devaluations of the [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] during the 1990s made Spanish exports more competitive.\nBy the late 1990s economic growth was strong, employment grew strongly, although unemployment remained high, as people returned to the job market and confidence in the economy returned. The last years of the 1990s saw property values begin to increase.\n\nThe Spanish economy was being credited for having avoided the virtual zero growth rate of some of its largest partners in the EU (namely France, Germany and Italy) in the late 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century. In 1995 Spain started an impressive economic cycle marked by an outstanding [[economic growth]], with figures around 3%, often well over this rate.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Country statistical profiles 2006 (the URL leads directly to information on Spain)\n |url=http://stats.oecd.org/WBOS/ViewHTML.aspx?QueryName=198&QueryType=View&Lang=en |work=OECD Stat Extracts |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |accessdate=1 May 2009\n}}</ref>  \n[[Image:Europe-GDP-PPP-per-capita-map.png|thumb|Map showing regional variation in European GDP (PPP) per capita in 2006.

Spain's mineral wealth and access to metals made it an important source of raw material during the early metal ages. Carthage conquered parts of Iberia after the First Punic War. After defeating Carthage in the [[Second Punic War]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] governed all of the Iberian Peninsula for centuries, expanding and diversifying the economy and extending Hispanic trade with the greater Republic and Empire.\n\n==Middle Ages==\nWhile most of western Europe fell into a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age]] after the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], those kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula that today are known as Spain maintained their economy.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} First, the [[Visigoths]] replaced the Roman imperial administrators (an international class at the top echelons). They established themselves as nobility. The kingdom had some degree of centralized power at their capital, which was eventually moved to Toledo from Toulouse. The Roman municipal and provincial governorships continued but the imperial superstructure of diocese and prefecture was of course completely gone as there was no need for it: these had existed to coordinate imperial defense and provide uniform administrative oversight, and symbolized as nothing else, except the professional army, the presence of the Roman. Though it suffered some decline, most Roman law and much physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, aqueducts and irrigation systems, was maintained to varying degrees unlike the complete disintegration that occurred in most other former parts of the western empire with the exception of parts of Italy. Later, when the [[Moors]] occupied large parts of the Iberian Peninsula alongside the Catholic kingdoms, they also maintained much of this Roman legacy; in fact as time went on they had Roman infrastructure repaired and extended. Meanwhile, in the countryside, where most people had always lived, life went on much as it had in Roman times, but with improvements due to the repair and extension of irrigation systems, and the introduction of novel crops and agricultural practices from the Islamic world. While trade dwindled in most of the former Roman lands in Europe, trade survived to some degree in Visigothic Spain, and flourished under the Moors through the integration of [[Al-Andalus]] (Moorish Spain) with the Mediterranean trade of the Islamic world. After [[Reconquista|800 years of intermittent warring]], the Catholic kingdoms had gradually become more powerful and sophisticated and eventually expelled all the Moors from the Peninsula.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Castile]], united with the [[Kingdom of Aragon]], had merchant navies that rivaled that of the [[Hanseatic League]] and [[Venice]]. Like the rest of late medieval Europe, restrictive guilds closely regulated all aspects of the economy-production, trade, and even transport. The most powerful of these corporations, the ''[[mesta]]'', controlled the production of wool, Castile's chief export.\n\n==Dynastic union and exploration==\nThe Reconquista allowed the [[Catholic Monarchs]] to divert their attention to exploration. In 1492, [[Pope Alexander VI]] (Rodrigo Borgia, a Valencian) formally approved the division of the unexplored world between kingdoms of what is today Spain and Portugal. New discoveries and conquests came in quick succession.\n\nIn 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus]] brought 1,500 colonists with him on his second voyage, a royal administrator had already been appointed for what the Catholic kingdoms referred to as the Indies. The Council of the Indies (''[[Consejo de Indias]]''), established in 1524 acted as an advisory board on colonial affairs, and the House of Trade (''[[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]]'') regulated trade with the colonies.\n\n===Gold and silver from the New World===\n{{main|Spanish Empire|Iberian Union}}\n{{See also|School of Salamanca}}\n[[File:La sevilla del sigloXVI.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|The port of [[Seville]] in the 1500s. Originally, all trade with the colonies in the Americas was required to go through this port.]]\nFollowing the discovery of America and the colonial expansion in the [[Spanish West Indies|Caribbean]] and [[Spanish Main|Continental America]], valuable agricultural products and mineral resources were introduced into Spain through regular [[Spanish treasure fleet|trade routes]]. New products such as potatoes, tomatoes and corn had a long-lasting impact on the Spanish economy, but more importantly on European demographics. Gold and silver bullion from American mines were used by the Spanish Crown to pay for troops in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Italy]], to maintain the emperor's forces in Germany and ships at sea, and to satisfy increasing consumer demand at home. However, the large volumes of precious metals from America led to inflation, which had a negative effect on the poorer part of the population, as goods became overpriced. This also hampered exports, as expensive goods could not compete in international markets. Moreover, the large cash inflows from silver hindered the industrial development in Spain as entrepreneurship seems to be indispensable.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The sale of titles to entrepreneurs who bought their way up the social ladder (a practice commonly found all over Europe), removing themselves from the productive sector of the economy, provided additional funds.\n\nThe overall effect of plague and emigration reduced peninsular Spain's population from over 8 million in the last years of the 16th century to under 7 million by the mid-17th century, with Castile the most severely affected region (85% of the Kingdom's population were in Castile), as an example, in 1500, Castile 6 million, and 1.25 million in the Kingdom of Aragon which included Catalonia, Valencian and the Balearic Islands.\n\n==Decline relative to Britain==\nThe Spanish economy diverged from the British economy in terms of GDP during the middle of the seventeenth century. The explanations for this divergence are unclear, but \"the divergence comes too late to have any medieval origins, whether cultural or institutional\" and \"it comes too early...  in order for the Napoleonic Invasions to be blamed.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Santiago Caballero|first=Carlos|last2=Palma|first2=Nuno|date=2019-11-18|title=Patterns of Iberian economic growth in the early modern period|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/cte/whrepe/29185.html|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Bourbon reforms==\nA slow economic recovery began in the last decades of the 17th century under the Habsburgs. Under the Bourbons, government efficiency was improved, especially under [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]]'s reign. The Bourbon reforms, however, resulted in no basic changes in the pattern of property holding. The nature of bourgeois class consciousness in Aragon and Castile hindered the creation of a middle-class movement. At the instance of liberal thinkers including [[Pedro Rodr\u00edguez de Campomanes|Campomanes]], various groups known as \"Economic Societies of friends of the Country\" were formed to promote economic development, new advances in the sciences, and Enlightenment philosophy (see ''[[Sociedad Econ\u00f3mica de los Amigos del Pa\u00eds]]''). However, despite the development of a national bureaucracy in Madrid, the reform movement could not be sustained without the patronage of Charles III, and it did not survive him.\n\nJan Bergeyck (advisor to Philip V) \"Disorder I have found here is beyond all imagination\".\nCastile's exchequer still used Roman numerals and there was no proper accounting.<ref>Henry Kamen the war of succession in spain</ref>\n\n==Napoleon and the War of Independence==\nSpain's American colonies took advantage of the postwar chaos to proclaim their independence. By 1825 only [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] remained under the Spanish flag in the New World. When [[Ferdinand VII]] was restored to the throne in 1813 and expended wealth and manpower in a vain effort to reassert control over the colonies. The move was unpopular among liberal officers assigned to the American wars.\n\n==1822 to 1898==\nThe economy was heavily focused around agricultural goods. The period saw regional industrialization in Catalonia and the Basque Country and the construction of railways in the second half of the nineteenth century helped alleviate some of the isolation of the interior but generally little changed for much of the country as political instability, uprisings and unstable governments slowed or undermined economic progress.\n\n==1898 to 1920==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Spain was still mostly rural; modern industry existed only in the textile mills around Barcelona in Catalonia and in the metallurgical plants of the Basque provinces.  The loss of Cuba and the Philippines benefited the Peninsula by causing capital to return and to be invested in updated domestic industries. But even with the  stimulus of World War I, only in [[Catalonia]] and in two Basque provinces ([[Biscay]] and [[Guipuscoa]]) did the value of manufacturing output in 1920 exceed that of agricultural production. Agricultural productivity was generally low compared with that of other West European countries because of a number of deficiencies: backward technology, lack of large irrigation projects, inadequate rural credit facilities, outmoded landtenure practices, as well as the age old problems of difficult terrain, unreliable climate, isolation and difficult transportation in the rugged interior. Financial institutions were relatively undeveloped. The [[Bank of Spain]] (''Banco de Espa\u00f1a'') was still privately owned, and its public functions were restricted to currency issuance and the provision of funds for state activities. The state largely limited itself to such traditional activities as defense and the maintenance of order and justice. Road building, education, and a few welfare activities were the only public services that had any appreciable impact on the economy.\n\n==Primo de Rivera==\nA General, [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]], was appointed prime minister by the king after a successful coup d'etat and for seven years dissolved parliament and ruled through directorates and the aid of the military until 1930.\n\nProtectionism, the Spanish neutrality during [[World War I]] (which allowed the country to trade with all belligerents) and state control of the economy led to a temporary economic recovery. The precipitous economic decline in 1930 undercut support for the government from special-interest groups. Criticism from academics mounted. Bankers expressed disappointment at the state loans that his government had tried to float. An attempt to reform the promotion system cost him the support of the army and, in turn, the support of the king. Primo de Rivera resigned and died shortly afterward in exile.\n\n==Second Republic, 1931\u201336==\nThe republican government substituted the monarchy and inherited the international economic crisis as well. Three different governments ruled during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], failing to execute numerous reforms, including land reform. General strikes were common and the economy stagnated.\n\nDuring the [[Spanish Civil War]], the country split into two different centralized economies, and the whole economic effort was redirected to the war industry. According to recent research,<ref>Weinstein, J and Imai, K. [http://www2.cid.harvard.edu/cidwp/051.pdf ''Measuring the Economic Impact of Civil Wars.''] (2000)</ref> growth is harmed during civil wars due to the huge contraction on private investment, and such was the case with the Spanish divided economy.\n\n=={{visible anchor|The Franco Era, 1939\u201375|The_Franco_Era.2C_1939-75}}==\n[[File:Cartilla_de_racionamiento_Espa\u00f1a_1945.JPG|thumb|right|Post-war ration card]]\n{{One source section|date=March 2020}}\nSpain emerged from the civil war with formidable economic problems. [[Gold]] and [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] reserves had been virtually wiped out, the massive devastation of war had reduced the productive capacity of both industry and [[Agriculture in Spain|agriculture]]. To compound the difficulties, even if the wherewithal had existed to purchase imports, the outbreak of [[World War II]] rendered many needed supplies unavailable. The end of the war did not improve Spain's plight because of subsequent global shortages of raw materials, and peacetime industrial products. Spain's European neighbours faced formidable post-war reconstruction problems of their own, and, because of their awareness that the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War had been achieved with the help of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]], they had no inclination to include Spain in any multilateral recovery programs or trade. For a decade following the Civil War's end in 1939, the wrecked and isolated economy remained in a state of severe [[depression (economics)|depression]].<ref name=\"countrystudy\">{{cite book |last1=Solsten |first1=Eric |last2=Meditz |first2=Sandra |title=Spain: a country study |date=1988 |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |location=Washington, D.C. |url=https://cdn.loc.gov/master/frd/frdcstdy/sp/spaincountrystud00sols_0/spaincountrystud00sols_0.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBranded an international outcast for its pro-[[Axis Powers|Axis]] bias during World War II, Spain was not invited to join the [[Marshall Plan]]. [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime sought to provide for Spain's well-being by adopting a policy of economic self-sufficiency. [[Autarky]] was not merely a reaction to [[international isolation]]; it was also rooted in more than half a century of advocacy from domestic economic pressure groups. Furthermore, from 1939 to 1945, Spain's military chiefs genuinely feared an Allied invasion of the Peninsula and, therefore, sought to avert excessive reliance on foreign armaments.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nWith the war devastation and trade isolation, Spain was much more economically backward in the 1940s than it had been a decade earlier. Inflation soared, [[economic reconstruction]] faltered, food was scarce, and, in some years, Spain registered negative growth rates. By the early 1950s, per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) was barely 40% of the average for West European countries. Then, after a decade of economic stagnation, a tripling of prices, the growth of a [[black market]], and widespread deprivation, gradual improvement began to take place. The regime took its first faltering steps toward abandoning its pretensions of self-sufficiency and towards a transformation of Spain's economic system. Pre-Civil War industrial production levels were regained in the early 1950s, though agricultural output remained below prewar levels until 1958.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nA further impetus to economic liberalization came from the September 1953 signing of a mutual defense agreement, the [[Pact of Madrid]], between the [[United States]] and Spain. In return for permitting the establishment of United States military bases on Spanish soil, the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] administration provided substantial economic aid to the Franco regime. More than US$1 billion in economic assistance flowed into Spain during the remainder of the decade as a result of the agreement. Between 1953 and 1958, Spain's [[gross national product]] (GNP) rose by about 5% per annum.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nThe years from 1951 to 1956 were marked by much economic progress, but the reforms of the period were implemented irregularly, and were poorly coordinated. One large obstacle to the reform process was the corrupt, inefficient, and bloated bureaucracy. By the mid-1950s, the inflationary spiral had resumed its upward climb, and foreign currency reserves that had stood at US$58 million in 1958 plummeted to US$6 million by mid-1959. The growing demands of the emerging middle class\u2014and of the ever-greater number of tourists\u2014for the amenities of life, particularly for higher nutritional standards, placed heavy demands on imported food and luxury items. At the same time, exports lagged, largely because of high domestic demand and institutional restraints on foreign trade. The [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] fell to an all-time low on the black market, and Spain's foreign currency obligations grew to almost US$60 million.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nA debate took place within the regime over strategies for extricating the country from its economic impasse, and Franco finally opted in favor of a group of [[neoliberals]]. The group included bankers, industrial executives, some academic economists, and members of the [[Roman Catholic]] lay organization, [[Opus Dei]].<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nDuring the 1957-59 period, known as the pre-stabilization years, economic planners contented themselves with piecemeal measures such as moderate anti-inflationary stopgaps and increases in Spain's links with the world economy. A combination of external developments and an increasingly aggravated domestic economic crisis, however, forced them to engage in more far-reaching changes.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nAs the need for a change in economic policy became manifest in the late 1950s, an overhaul of the Council of Ministers in February 1957 brought to the key ministries a group of younger men, most of whom possessed economics training and experience. This reorganization was quickly followed by the establishment of a committee on economic affairs and the Office of Economic Coordination and Planning under the prime minister.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nSuch administrative changes were important steps in eliminating the chronic rivalries that existed among economic ministries. Other reforms followed, the principal one being the adoption of a corporate tax system that required the confederation of each industrial sector to allocate an appropriate share of the entire industry's tax assessment to each member firm. Chronic tax evasion was consequently made more difficult, and tax collection receipts rose sharply. Together with curbs on government spending, in 1958 this reform created the first government surplus in many years.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nMore drastic remedies were required as Spain's isolation from the rest of Western Europe became exacerbated. Neighboring states were in the process of establishing the EC and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA\u2014see Glossary). In the process of liberalizing trade among their members, these organizations found it difficult to establish economic relations with countries wedded to trade quotas and bilateral agreements, such as Spain.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\n===The \"Spanish Miracle\"===\n\nSpanish membership in these groups was not politically possible, but Spain was invited to join a number of other international institutions. In January 1958, Spain became an associate member of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), which became the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in September 1961. In 1959 Spain joined the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]]. These bodies immediately became involved in helping Spain to abandon the autarkical trade practices that had brought its reserves to such low levels and that were isolating its economy from the rest of Europe.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n[[File:Soviet Union USSR GDP per capita.png|thumb|right|GDP per capita of Spain from 1913 to 1990.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maddison |first1=Angus |title=The world economy |date=2006 |publisher=Development Centre of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) |location=Paris, France |isbn=978-92-64-02261-4 |pages=400-600 |url=https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/world_economy.pdf}}</ref>]]\nIn December 1958, after seven months of preparation and drafting, aided by IMF, Spain unveiled its Stabilization Plan on June 30, 1959. The plan's objectives were twofold: to take the necessary fiscal and monetary measures required to restrict demand and to contain inflation, while, at the same time, liberalizing foreign trade and encouraging foreign investment. The plan's initial effect was deflationary and recessionary, leading to a drop in real income and to a rise in unemployment during its first year. The resultant economic slump and reduced wages led approximately 500,000 Spanish workers to emigrate in search of better job opportunities in other West European countries. Nonetheless, its main goals were achieved. The plan enabled Spain to avert a possible suspension of payments abroad to foreign banks holding Spanish currency, and by the close of 1959, Spain's foreign exchange account showed a US$100-million surplus. Foreign capital investment grew sevenfold between 1958 and 1960, and the annual influx of tourists began to rise rapidly, bringing in very much needed foreign exchange along remittances from Spanish workers abroad.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n[[File:Playa de Benidorm. Alicante (18300025123).jpg|thumb|right|Beach in Benidorm circa 1960]]\nAs these developments steadily converted Spain's economic structure into one more closely resembling a [[free-market economy]], the country entered the greatest cycle of industrialization and prosperity it had ever known. Foreign aid took the form of US$75 million in drawing rights from the IMF, US$100 million in OEEC credits, US$70 million in commercial credits from the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] and the [[First National City Bank]], US$30 million from the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States]], and funds from United States aid programs. Total foreign backing amounted to US$420 million. The principal lubricants of the economic expansion, however, were the hard currency [[remittances]] of one million Spanish workers abroad, which are estimated to have offset 17.9% of the total trade deficit from 1962 to 1971; the gigantic increase in tourism that drew more than 20 million visitors per year by the end of the 1960s, accounting by then for 9% of GNP; a car industry that grew at a staggering compound rate of 21.7% per year from 1958 to 1972; and direct foreign investment, which between 1960 and 1974 amounted to an impressive US$7.6 billion. More than 40% of this investment came from the United States, almost 17% came from [[Switzerland]], and the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] and France each accounted for slightly more than 10%. By 1975 foreign capital represented 12.4% of the total invested in Spain's 500 largest industrial firms. More important than the actual size of the foreign investment was the access it gave Spanish companies to up to date technology. An additional billion dollars came from foreign sources through a variety of loans and credit devices.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>[[File:Seat 850 Sport Jarama 2006.JPG|right|thumb|[[SEAT 850|SEAT 850 Sport]], 1967. SEAT became a symbol of the \"Spanish Miracle\", 1959-1974.]]\n\nTo help achieve rapid development, there was massive government investment through key state-owned companies like the national industrial conglomerate [[Instituto Nacional de Industria]], the mass-market car company [[SEAT]] in [[Barcelona]], the shipbuilder [[Navantia|Empresa Nacional Baz\u00e1n]]. With foreign access to the Spanish domestic market restricted by heavy tariffs and quotas, these national companies led the industrialisation of the country, restoring the prosperity of old industrial areas like Barcelona and [[Bilbao]] and creating new industrial areas, most notably around [[Madrid]]. Although there was considerable economic liberalisation in the period these enterprises remained under state control.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nThe success of the stabilization program was attributable to a combination of good luck and good management and the impressive development during this period was referred to as the \"[[Spanish miracle]]\". Between 1959 and 1974, Spain had the next fastest economic growth rate after [[Japan]]. The boom came to an end with the [[1970s energy crisis|oil shocks]] of the 1970s and government instability during the transition back to democracy after Franco's death in 1975.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\n==The Post-Franco period, 1975\u20131980s==\n{{One source section|date=March 2020}}\nFranco's death in 1975 and the ensuing [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democratic rule]] diverted Spaniards' attention from their economy. The return to democracy coincided with an [[1979 energy crisis|explosive quadrupling of oil prices]], which had an extremely serious effect on the economy because Spain imported 70% of its energy, mostly in the form of [[Middle Eastern]] oil. Nonetheless, the interim centrist government of [[Adolfo Suarez Gonzalez]], which had been named to succeed the Franco regime by [[King Juan Carlos]], did little to shore up the economy or even to reduce Spain's dependence on imported oil, although there was little that could be done as the country had little in the way of hydrocarbon deposits. A virtually exclusive preoccupation with the politics of democratization during the politically and socially unstable period when the new constitution was drafted and enacted, absorbed most of Spain's politics and administration at the expense of economic policy.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nBecause of the failure to adjust to the changed economic environment brought on by the two oil price shocks of the 1970s, Spain quickly confronted plummeting productivity, an explosive increase in wages from 1974 to 1976, a reversal of migration trends as a result of the economic slump throughout Western Europe, and the steady outflow of labor from agricultural areas despite declining job prospects in the cities. All these factors contributed to a sharp rise in the unemployment rate. Government budgetary deficits swelled, as did large [[social security]] cost overruns and the huge operating losses incurred by a number of public-sector industries. Energy consumption, meanwhile, remained high.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nWhen the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] government headed by [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] took office in late 1982, inflation was running at an annual rate of 16%, the external current account was US$4 billion in arrears, public spending was large, and [[foreign exchange reserves]] had become dangerously depleted. In coping with the situation, however, the Gonzalez government had one asset that no previous post-Franco government had enjoyed, namely, a solid parliamentary majority in both houses of the Cortes (Spanish Parliament). With this majority, it was able to undertake unpopular austerity measures that earlier governments had not.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nThe Socialist government opted for pragmatic, orthodox monetary and fiscal policies, together with a series of vigorous retrenchment measures. In 1983 it unveiled a program that provided a more coherent and long-term approach to the country's economic ills. Renovative structural policies\u2014such as the closing of large, unprofitable state enterprises\u2014helped to correct the relatively poor performance of the economy. The government launched an industrial reconversion program, brought the problem-ridden social security system into better balance, and introduced a more efficient energy-use policy. [[Labour market flexibility|Labor market flexibility]] was improved, and private capital investment was encouraged with incentives.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nBy 1985 the budgetary deficit was brought down to 5% of GNP, and it dropped to 4.5% in 1986. Real wage growth was contained, and it was generally kept below the rate of inflation. Inflation was reduced to 4.5% in 1987, and analysts believed it might decrease to the government's goal of 3% in 1988.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nEfforts to modernize and to expand the economy together with a number of factors fostered strong economic growth in the 1980s. Those factors were the continuing fall in oil prices, increased tourism, and a massive upsurge in the inflow of foreign investment. Thus, despite the fact that the economy was being exposed to foreign competition in accordance with EC requirements, the Spanish economy underwent rapid expansion without experiencing balance of payments' constraints.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nIn the words of the OECD's 1987-88 survey of the Spanish economy, \"following a protracted period of sluggish growth with slow progress in winding down inflation during the late 1970s and the first half of the 1980s, the Spanish economy has entered a phase of vigorous expansion of output and employment accompanied by a marked slowdown of inflation.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=OECD Economic Surveys: Spain 1988OECD Economic Surveys: Spain 1988|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/economics/oecd-economic-surveys-spain-1988_eco_surveys-esp-1988-en|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development|accessdate=29 January 2013}}</ref>  In 1981 Spain's GDP growth rate had reached a nadir by registering a rate of negative 0.2%; it then gradually resumed its slow upward ascent with increases of 1.2% in 1982, 1.8% in 1983, 1.9% in 1984, and 2.1% in 1985. The following year, however, Spain's real GDP began to grow strongly, registering a growth rate of 3.3% in 1986 and 5.5% in 1987. Although these growth rates were less than those of the economic miracle years, they were among the strongest of the OECD. Analysts projected a rise of 3.8% in 1988 and of 3.5% in 1989, a slight decline but still roughly double the EC average. They expected that declining interest rates and the government's stimulative budget would help sustain economic expansion. Industrial output, which rose by 3.1% in 1986 and by 5.2% in 1987, was also expected to maintain its expansive rate, growing by 3.8% in 1988 and by 3.7% in 1989.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nA prime force generating rapid economic growth was increased domestic demand, which grew by a steep 6% in 1986 and by 4.8% in 1987, in both years exceeding official projections. During 1988 and 1989, analysts expected demand to remain strong, though at slightly lower levels. Much of the large increase in demand was met in 1987 by an estimated 20% jump in real terms in imports of goods and services.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Spain achieved a strong level of economic performance while simultaneously lowering its rate of inflation to within two points of the EC average. However, its export performance, though increasing, raised concerns over the existing imbalance between import and export growth.<ref name=\"countrystudy\"></ref>\n\n==European integration, 1985\u20132000==\n[[File:Torre Mapfre y Hotel Ars.jpg|280px|thumb|left|View of the [[Torre Mapfre]] and [[Hotel Arts]] ([[Barcelona]]) built in 1992.]]\nAfter Franco's death in 1975, the country returned to democracy in the form of a constitutional monarchy in 1978, with elections being held in 1977 and with the constitution being ratified in 1978. The move to democracy saw Spain become more involved with the [[European integration]].\n\n[[Felipe Gonzalez]] became prime minister when his Socialist Party won the 1982 elections. He enacted a number of liberal reforms, increasing civil liberties and implementing universal free education for those 16 and younger. He also lobbied successfully for Spain to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and to remain part of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]].\n\nThe [[European Union]] at the time Spain joined, in 1986, existed primarily as a trading union - the EEC, and better trade links were vital to the fragile Spanish economy. Unemployment was high, about 18 percent, and the Spanish GDP was 71 percent of the EU average. The single market and European funding offered a chance to bring the Spanish economy up to the standards of the rest of Western Europe, along with the support of Spain's wealthier neighbors. There was the promise of lucrative deals with influential countries such as Germany, France and the UK.\n\nAlthough the Spanish Miracle years (1959\u20131974) witnessed unprecedented improvements in infrastructure and social services, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe. Education was limited, women were largely excluded from the workforce, health care was largely private and unevenly distributed and the country's infrastructure was relatively poor. In 1985, Spain had only {{convert|1,300|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of motorways. Since the end of the economic miracle in 1974, the country's economy had been stagnant. Joining the European Economic Community was perceived by most of the population as a way to restart the process of modernization and improvement of the population's average purchasing power.\n\nSpain joined the [[European Economic Community]], as the [[European Union]] was then known, in January 1986 at the same time as neighbor [[Portugal]]. Membership ushered the country into opening its economy, modernizing its industrial base and revising economic legislation to open its previously protected markets to foreign competition. With help of EU funds ([[Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds]], [[European Regional Development Fund]], etc.) Spain greatly improved infrastructures, increased GDP growth, reduced the [[public debt]] to GDP ratio.\nSpain has been a driving force in the European community ever since. The country was a leading proponent of the EU single currency, the [[euro]], long before it had been put into circulation. Together with the other founding euro members, it adopted the new physical currency on January 1, 2002. On that date Spain terminated its historic [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] currency and replaced it with the [[euro]], which has become its national currency shared the rest of the [[Eurozone]]. This culminated a fast process of economic modernization even though the strength of the euro since its adoption has raised concerns regarding the fact that Spanish exports outside the European Union are being priced out of the range of foreign buyers, with the country losing [[monetary sovereignty]] in favour of the [[European Central Bank]], which must look after several different -often opposed- national interests.\n\nIn the early 1990s Spain, like most other countries, was hit by the [[early 1990s recession]]. which coincided with the end of the construction push put in place for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympics]].\n\n==Boom 1997\u20132007 ==\n[[File:Talgo 350.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Talgo 350]] high-speed service, [[Madrid]] - [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]]]\n\nThe country was confronted with very high unemployment, entrenched by its then rigid labour market. However the economy began to recover during the first [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar]] administration (1996-2000), driven by a return of consumer confidence, increased private consumption and liberalization and deregulation reforms aiming to reduce the State's role in the market place. Unemployment at 7.6% (October 2006), represented a significant improvement from the 1980s levels and a better rate than the one of Germany or France at the time. Devaluations of the [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] during the 1990s made Spanish exports more competitive.\nBy the late 1990s economic growth was strong, employment grew strongly, although unemployment remained high, as people returned to the job market and confidence in the economy returned. The last years of the 1990s saw property values begin to increase.\n\nThe Spanish economy was being credited for having avoided the virtual zero growth rate of some of its largest partners in the EU (namely France, Germany and Italy) in the late 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century. In 1995 Spain started an impressive economic cycle marked by an outstanding [[economic growth]], with figures around 3%, often well over this rate.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Country statistical profiles 2006 (the URL leads directly to information on Spain)\n |url=http://stats.oecd.org/WBOS/ViewHTML.aspx?QueryName=198&QueryType=View&Lang=en |work=OECD Stat Extracts |publisher=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] |accessdate=1 May 2009\n}}</ref>  \n[[Image:Europe-GDP-PPP-per-capita-map.png|thumb|Map showing regional variation in European GDP (PPP) per capita in 2006.

De Soto reportedly died in that area in May 1542, although some accounts suggest that he died near [[Lake Village, Arkansas]]. See [[List of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition|here]] for a list of sites associated with the 16th-century De Soto Expedition. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Early history===\nIndian artifacts collected in DeSoto County link it with prehistoric groups of Woodland and [[Mississippian culture]] peoples. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Members of the [[Mississippian culture]], who built complex settlements and earthwork monuments throughout the Mississippi River Valley, met [[Hernando DeSoto]] when he explored what is now North Mississippi. By tradition, he is believed to have traveled with his expedition through present-day DeSoto County. Some scholars speculate that DeSoto discovered the [[Mississippi River]] west of present-day Lake Cormorant, built rafts there, and crossed to present-day [[Crowley's Ridge]], Arkansas. Based on records of the expedition and archeology, the [[National Park Service]] has designated a \"DeSoto Corridor\" from [[Coahoma County, Mississippi]] to the Chickasaw Bluff (Memphis).\n\nThe Mississippian culture declined and disappeared, and in most areas this preceded European contact. It is speculated that it may have been because of changes in the environment. The town named ''Chicasa'', which De Soto visited, was probably the ancestral home of the historical [[Chickasaw]], who are descended from the Mississippian culture. They had lived in the area for centuries before white settlers began arriving. Present-day [[Pontotoc, Mississippi]] developed near the Chickasaw \"Long Town,\" which was composed of several villages near each other. The Chickasaw Nation regarded much of western Tennessee and northern Mississippi as their traditional hunting grounds.\n\nThe [[Chickasaw]] traded furs for French goods, and the French established several small settlements among them. However, France ceded its claim to territories east of the Mississippi River to Britain in 1763, after having been defeated in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The United States acquired the area from the British as part of the treaty that ended the [[American Revolution]].\n\n==19th-20th centuries==\nThe Chickasaw finally ceded most of their land to the United States under pressure during [[Indian Removal]], and a treaty in 1832. They were forced to remove to [[Indian Territory]] west of the Mississippi River.\n\nNegotiations began in September 1816 between the United States government and the Chickasaw nation, and concluded with the signing of the [[Treaty of Pontotoc]] in October 1832. During these 16 years, federal officials pressed the Chickasaw for cessions of land to extinguish their land claims, in order to enable white settlement in their territory. Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] in 1830, authorizing forcible removal if necessary to extinguish Native American claims in the Southeast. From 1832 to 1836, government surveyors mapped the {{convert|6442000|acre|km2|0}} of the Chickasaw domain, dividing it into townships, ranges and sections. The Mississippi Legislature formed 10 new counties, including DeSoto, Tunica, Marshall, and Tate, from this territory.\n\nBy treaty the land was assigned by sections of {{convert|640|acre|km2}} to individual Indian households. The Chickasaw, a numerically small tribe, were assigned {{convert|2422400|acre|km2|0}} of land using this formula. The government declared the remainder as surplus and disposed of these remaining {{convert|400000|acre|km2}} at public sale. The Indians received at least $1.25 per acre for their land. The government land sold for 75 cents per acre or less.\n\nDuring and after the Civil War, this area was developed as large plantations by planters for cultivation of cotton, a leading commodity crop. Before the Civil War they depended on the labor of thousands of enslaved African Americans. After the war and emancipation, many [[freedmen]] stayed in the area, but shaped their own lives by working on small plots as [[sharecroppers]] or tenant farmers, rather than on large labor gangs on the plantations. Reliance on agriculture meant that the area did not develop much economically well into the 20th century, and both whites and blacks suffered economically.\n\n{{main|Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era}}\nIn 1890 the state legislature [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] under the new constitution, which used [[poll taxes]] and [[literacy test]]s to raise barriers to voter registration. In the early 20th century, many people left the rural county for cities to gain other opportunities. Most blacks could not vote in Mississippi until the late 1960s, after passage of federal legislation.\n\n[[File:DeSoto County Co-op, DeSoto County, Mississippi (1954).jpg|thumb|right|DeSoto County Co-op in Hernando, a sharecroppers' union, 1954]]\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the Southern Tenant Farmers Union was organized in 1934; it was open to both black and white [[sharecroppers]]. It worked to gain better deals and fair accounting from local white landowners. Whites in DeSoto County resisted this effort. In 1935, a white lynch mob attacked early union organizer and minister Reverend T. A. Allen, shooting him and throwing him into the [[Coldwater River (Mississippi)|Coldwater River]].<ref name=\"nave\">[http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2015/feb/11/report-hinds-county-had-most-miss-lynchings/ R.L.

This fast-paced growth is attributed to suburban development, as middle-class and wealthier blacks leave Memphis to acquire newer housing. They commute to Memphis for work. Some observers have characterized this shift as [[black flight]], but it is also typical of the pattern of post-World War II suburban growth, in which people who could afford it moved to newer housing in suburbs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/feb/04/black-flight-propels-desoto/|work=Commercial Appeal|place=Memphis, Tennessee|title='Black flight' propels DeSoto County growth, census figures show|author=Henry Bailey|date=February 4, 2011|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSuch suburban residential development in the county has been most noticeable in the cities of [[Southaven, Mississippi|Southaven]], [[Olive Branch, Mississippi|Olive Branch]] and Horn Lake, Mississippi. Also stimulating development in the formerly rural area is the massive casino/resort complex located in neighboring [[Tunica County, Mississippi|Tunica County]] (this is the third-largest gambling district in the United States).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Politics==\nThe majority-white voters in DeSoto County increasingly favored Republican presidential candidates from 1980 to 2000, but changing demographics could affect that. White conservatives in the state had shifted from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party following passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s. At the same time, given the increase in whites in the county and some outmigration by blacks, their number and percentage of population in the county declined. African Americans have generally supported the Democratic Party since passage of civil rights legislation. By 2000 they comprise 11% of the county population.\n\nBut beginning in 2004, the Democratic Party candidates have shown renewed strength in the county, attracting more votes than the percentage of African Americans in the population. During this period, the proportion of African Americans in the county has increased. The voting has continued to show racial polarization, with most whites voting for Republican candidates. As of 2013 census estimates, African Americans made up slightly more than 21% of the county population.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-03-06}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

De Soto reportedly died in that area in May 1542, although some accounts suggest that he died near [[Lake Village, Arkansas]]. See [[List of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition|here]] for a list of sites associated with the 16th-century De Soto Expedition. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Early history===\nIndian artifacts collected in DeSoto County link it with prehistoric groups of Woodland and [[Mississippian culture]] peoples. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Members of the [[Mississippian culture]], who built complex settlements and earthwork monuments throughout the Mississippi River Valley, met [[Hernando DeSoto]] when he explored what is now North Mississippi. By tradition, he is believed to have traveled with his expedition through present-day DeSoto County. Some scholars speculate that DeSoto discovered the [[Mississippi River]] west of present-day Lake Cormorant, built rafts there, and crossed to present-day [[Crowley's Ridge]], Arkansas. Based on records of the expedition and archeology, the [[National Park Service]] has designated a \"DeSoto Corridor\" from [[Coahoma County, Mississippi]] to the Chickasaw Bluff (Memphis).\n\nThe Mississippian culture declined and disappeared, and in most areas this preceded European contact. It is speculated that it may have been because of changes in the environment. The town named ''Chicasa'', which De Soto visited, was probably the ancestral home of the historical [[Chickasaw]], who are descended from the Mississippian culture. They had lived in the area for centuries before white settlers began arriving. Present-day [[Pontotoc, Mississippi]] developed near the Chickasaw \"Long Town,\" which was composed of several villages near each other. The Chickasaw Nation regarded much of western Tennessee and northern Mississippi as their traditional hunting grounds.\n\nThe [[Chickasaw]] traded furs for French goods, and the French established several small settlements among them. However, France ceded its claim to territories east of the Mississippi River to Britain in 1763, after having been defeated in the [[Seven Years' War]]. The United States acquired the area from the British as part of the treaty that ended the [[American Revolution]].\n\n==19th-20th centuries==\nThe Chickasaw finally ceded most of their land to the United States under pressure during [[Indian Removal]], and a treaty in 1832. They were forced to remove to [[Indian Territory]] west of the Mississippi River.\n\nNegotiations began in September 1816 between the United States government and the Chickasaw nation, and concluded with the signing of the [[Treaty of Pontotoc]] in October 1832. During these 16 years, federal officials pressed the Chickasaw for cessions of land to extinguish their land claims, in order to enable white settlement in their territory. Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] in 1830, authorizing forcible removal if necessary to extinguish Native American claims in the Southeast. From 1832 to 1836, government surveyors mapped the {{convert|6442000|acre|km2|0}} of the Chickasaw domain, dividing it into townships, ranges and sections. The Mississippi Legislature formed 10 new counties, including DeSoto, Tunica, Marshall, and Tate, from this territory.\n\nBy treaty the land was assigned by sections of {{convert|640|acre|km2}} to individual Indian households. The Chickasaw, a numerically small tribe, were assigned {{convert|2422400|acre|km2|0}} of land using this formula. The government declared the remainder as surplus and disposed of these remaining {{convert|400000|acre|km2}} at public sale. The Indians received at least $1.25 per acre for their land. The government land sold for 75 cents per acre or less.\n\nDuring and after the Civil War, this area was developed as large plantations by planters for cultivation of cotton, a leading commodity crop. Before the Civil War they depended on the labor of thousands of enslaved African Americans. After the war and emancipation, many [[freedmen]] stayed in the area, but shaped their own lives by working on small plots as [[sharecroppers]] or tenant farmers, rather than on large labor gangs on the plantations. Reliance on agriculture meant that the area did not develop much economically well into the 20th century, and both whites and blacks suffered economically.\n\n{{main|Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era}}\nIn 1890 the state legislature [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] under the new constitution, which used [[poll taxes]] and [[literacy test]]s to raise barriers to voter registration. In the early 20th century, many people left the rural county for cities to gain other opportunities. Most blacks could not vote in Mississippi until the late 1960s, after passage of federal legislation.\n\n[[File:DeSoto County Co-op, DeSoto County, Mississippi (1954).jpg|thumb|right|DeSoto County Co-op in Hernando, a sharecroppers' union, 1954]]\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the Southern Tenant Farmers Union was organized in 1934; it was open to both black and white [[sharecroppers]]. It worked to gain better deals and fair accounting from local white landowners. Whites in DeSoto County resisted this effort. In 1935, a white lynch mob attacked early union organizer and minister Reverend T. A. Allen, shooting him and throwing him into the [[Coldwater River (Mississippi)|Coldwater River]].<ref name=\"nave\">[http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2015/feb/11/report-hinds-county-had-most-miss-lynchings/ R.L.

This fast-paced growth is attributed to suburban development, as middle-class and wealthier blacks leave Memphis to acquire newer housing. They commute to Memphis for work. Some observers have characterized this shift as [[black flight]], but it is also typical of the pattern of post-World War II suburban growth, in which people who could afford it moved to newer housing in suburbs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/feb/04/black-flight-propels-desoto/|work=Commercial Appeal|place=Memphis, Tennessee|title='Black flight' propels DeSoto County growth, census figures show|author=Henry Bailey|date=February 4, 2011|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSuch suburban residential development in the county has been most noticeable in the cities of [[Southaven, Mississippi|Southaven]], [[Olive Branch, Mississippi|Olive Branch]] and Horn Lake, Mississippi. Also stimulating development in the formerly rural area is the massive casino/resort complex located in neighboring [[Tunica County, Mississippi|Tunica County]] (this is the third-largest gambling district in the United States).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Politics==\nThe majority-white voters in DeSoto County increasingly favored Republican presidential candidates from 1980 to 2000, but changing demographics could affect that. White conservatives in the state had shifted from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party following passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s. At the same time, given the increase in whites in the county and some outmigration by blacks, their number and percentage of population in the county declined. African Americans have generally supported the Democratic Party since passage of civil rights legislation. By 2000 they comprise 11% of the county population.\n\nBut beginning in 2004, the Democratic Party candidates have shown renewed strength in the county, attracting more votes than the percentage of African Americans in the population. During this period, the proportion of African Americans in the county has increased. The voting has continued to show racial polarization, with most whites voting for Republican candidates. As of 2013 census estimates, African Americans made up slightly more than 21% of the county population.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-03-06}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

By road it is {{convert|38.5|km}} north of [[Aarhus]], {{convert|43.8|km}} east of [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]], and {{convert|224|km}} northwest of [[Copenhagen]].\n\nRanders became a thriving market town in medieval times, and many of its 15th-century half-timbered houses remain today, as does [[St Martin's Church, Randers|St Martin's Church]], also from that period. Trade by sea was facilitated through the [[Guden\u00e5]] River, entering [[Randers Fjord]]. During [[industrialization]], Randers quickly became one of the most important industrial towns in the country, but it saw itself outpaced by the cities of Aarhus and Aalborg at the beginning of the 20th century. Most of the larger historic industries in Randers are gone today. From 1970, the population saw a decline from a peak of 58.500 citizens, until a stabilization in the 1990s occurred, followed by a modest rise since then.<ref name=\"DMT\">See Denmark's Market Towns: Randers</ref>\n\nThe main tourist attraction is [[Randers Tropical Zoo]] thanks to its artificial [[rainforest]], the largest in Northern Europe, its 350 varieties of plant and over 175 species of animals. The city's [[Football (soccer)|football]] team, [[Randers FC]], play their homes games at the [[AutoC Park Randers]], and are in Denmark's first league, the [[Superligaen]]. The town is also home to Randers rugby union club and [[Jutland RLFC]], a [[rugby league]] team, as well as [[Randers Cimbria]], a [[Basketligaen]] team that took 2nd place in the 2013\u20132014 season.\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nThe oldest forms of the town's name appear on coins minted from the times of [[Canute IV of Denmark|Canute the Holy]] (1080\u201386) until those of [[Sweyn III of Denmark|Svend Grathe]] (1146\u201357).

[[Canute IV of Denmark]] (ca. 1043\u20131086), also known as Canute the Saint and Canute the Holy, and as [[patron saint]] of Denmark, minted coins in the town.{{sfn|Fodor|1964|p=163}} The peasants of Randers who rose up against him and his plans to attack [[England]] and its ruler, [[William the Conqueror]], assembled in this town. Their uprising led to the death of Canute.{{sfn|Christiansen|1980|p=254}}\nA [[chronicle]] written at [[Essenb\u00e6k Abbey]] tells of a fire that ravaged the city. The city was destroyed and rebuilt three times in the 13th century. In 1246, it was burned down by [[Abel of Denmark]]'s troops during the civil uprising against [[Eric IV of Denmark]]. On a street in the town center is the house where, according to legend, Danish nobleman and national hero [[Niels Ebbesen]] killed Count [[Gerhard III|Richard (Gerhard) III of Holstein]] on 1 April 1340, during the Kingless Times, when the entire country was pledged to German counts. This action led to further insurrection against the Germans. Ebbesen died in a large battle at [[Skanderborg#Skanderborg Castle|Skanderborg Castle]] in December 1340.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/niels-ebbesen-ca-1300-1340/|title=Niels Ebbesen |publisher=Danmarkshistorien.dk|accessdate=6 August 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> A statue to Ebbesen stands in front of Randers' Town Hall today.\n\nWhen King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark|Valdemar IV of Denmark (Valdemar Atterdag)]] tried to assemble a government in 1350 after the mortgaging to the Holsteiners, the town was further reinforced with protection, and was often named as ''Randershus'' (\"Randers Fortress\"). This fortification was captured by dissatisfied nobility in 1357. In 1359 Valdemar attacked the captured city with the strength of all of his forces.{{Sfn|Pierer|1858|p=705}} During medieval times the city prospered as a market town.{{sfn|Sale|2007|p=68}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:NIels Ebbesen hus.jpg|thumb|left|The half-timbered mechants house Niels Ebbesen's Gaard from 1643.

It prospered in the 15th and 16th centuries trading both nationally and overseas thanks to its harbour and cargo shipping maintained by competent craftsmen. Salmon fishing also contributed to the local economy.<ref name=dcfb>{{cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/koebstaeder/by.aspx?koebstadID=40|title=Randers: Byhistorie|publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|accessdate=17 April 2015 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\nThe town was fortified through much of the [[Middle Ages]]. Today, however, the only sign of [[defensive wall]]s is their existence in street names. These streets follow a circular path, presumably following the location of the historic walls. Street names include ''\u00d8stervold'' (\"Eastern Defense Wall\"), ''N\u00f8rreport'' (\"Northern Gate\"), ''Vestervold'' (\"Western Defense Wall\"), and ''Lille Voldgade'' (\"Little Defense Wall Street\").\n\nIn 1534 a farmers' uprising tried to storm the town unsuccessfully; it was part of wider regional peasant unrest affecting the Jutland region the same year, leading to the death of some 2000 by the sword in Aalborg alone.{{sfn|Murray|1858|p=87}} Massive moats were set up around the town under the rule of King [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] (1536\u20131559). The town was already known for its glove-making in the Middle Ages but at the beginning of the 18th century the industry really prospered. During the second half of the 17th century, the town suffered not only from the Swedish wars but experienced the plague and extensive fires. From the mid-17th century, the economy began to thrive once more, the harbour was extended bringing an increase in shipping. By the end of the 18th century, it had become Jutland's largest town with 4,500 inhabitants.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\nDuring its peak there were almost 170 merchants' estates in the area, and a sizeable navy that sailed around the world. Some of these old [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] [[Estate (house)|estates]] and [[Manorialism|manor homes]] can still be seen in the town. Randers is known as Crown Jutland (''Kronjylland'') and its inhabitants as Crown Jutlanders (''Kronjyde''), probably due to its large estates owned by the monarchy. It was Denmark's poets who first started to use the term Kronjyde in the mid-18th century.<ref name=danishnet/> [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] (1783\u20131872) and [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1805\u20131875), and especially [[Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (1857\u20131943), used the term. The population in 1880 was 13,457.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Industrialisation and modern times===\n[[File:-Randers 1900.jpg|thumb|Map of Randers (1900).]]\nDuring the [[History of Denmark#Industrialisation|industrialisation]], Randers became a centre for the developing [[agricultural industry]] and a number of manufacturing businesses and heavy machinery factories also emerged. According to \"[[The Popular Encyclopedia; or, Conversations Lexicon]]\", Blackie & Son (c. 1890), Randers contained at that time an [[arsenal]], a classical school with six professors, and had several industrial establishments, including manufacturers of gloves, for which the town had long been famous. Randers was also known for salmon, rope, and pretty women. <!--(What is this about?)

In particular the crafts and industry sector grew and Randers became one of the most important industrial towns in Denmark. Trade and seafaring continued to be major sectors of the local economy and the harbour was expanded and improved several times during this era. With the opening of the first railway line to Aarhus in 1862, the barge-transports on the Guden River declined dramatically. This however paved the way for a booming railway manufacturing industry. Even though the population of Randers grew in these years, it was also the time, when the town was outpaced by Aarhus and Aalborg.<ref name=\"DMT\"/>\n\n[[File:Randers Handsker i lammeskind.JPG|thumb|Randers has been known for its glove production for centuries.]]\nThe [[gloves|glove]] factory of ''Randers Handskefabrik'' was established in 1811, and is considered among the oldest glove factories in the World. The manufacturing of gloves in Randers has been traced back to 1200s, in the 1600s it was the primary occupation here and from the 1700s the gloves became known abroad, with exports to Sweden, Germany, Russia, France and England. After some decades with declining productions, the factory was built, industrialising and boosting the productions, guided by the knowledge of the Parisian glovemaker [[Charles Mattat]]. Shops in London and New York were added to the company in 1892. In 1927, Randers Handsker were acquired by the Danish Vejrum family, who still owns and runs the company today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoflev.dk/article.asp?id=116|title=Kongelig Hofleverand\u00f8r \u2013 Randersk Handsker [By appointment to the Royal Danish Court \u2013 Randers Gloves] |publisher=Nostra |language=Danish|accessdate=8 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thor-Bier.jpg|thumb|left|Thor, a beer brand associated with the city of Randers.]]\nThe larger emerging industries included the [[Thor Brewery|Thor breweries]], founded in 1856 by the businessman [[Christian Emil Synnestvedt]], but built in 1850 by the Swedish entrepreneur [[Johan Peter Lindahl]].

By road it is {{convert|38.5|km}} north of [[Aarhus]], {{convert|43.8|km}} east of [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]], and {{convert|224|km}} northwest of [[Copenhagen]].\n\nRanders became a thriving market town in medieval times, and many of its 15th-century half-timbered houses remain today, as does [[St Martin's Church, Randers|St Martin's Church]], also from that period. Trade by sea was facilitated through the [[Guden\u00e5]] River, entering [[Randers Fjord]]. During [[industrialization]], Randers quickly became one of the most important industrial towns in the country, but it saw itself outpaced by the cities of Aarhus and Aalborg at the beginning of the 20th century. Most of the larger historic industries in Randers are gone today. From 1970, the population saw a decline from a peak of 58.500 citizens, until a stabilization in the 1990s occurred, followed by a modest rise since then.<ref name=\"DMT\">See Denmark's Market Towns: Randers</ref>\n\nThe main tourist attraction is [[Randers Tropical Zoo]] thanks to its artificial [[rainforest]], the largest in Northern Europe, its 350 varieties of plant and over 175 species of animals. The city's [[Football (soccer)|football]] team, [[Randers FC]], play their homes games at the [[AutoC Park Randers]], and are in Denmark's first league, the [[Superligaen]]. The town is also home to Randers rugby union club and [[Jutland RLFC]], a [[rugby league]] team, as well as [[Randers Cimbria]], a [[Basketligaen]] team that took 2nd place in the 2013\u20132014 season.\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nThe oldest forms of the town's name appear on coins minted from the times of [[Canute IV of Denmark|Canute the Holy]] (1080\u201386) until those of [[Sweyn III of Denmark|Svend Grathe]] (1146\u201357).

[[Canute IV of Denmark]] (ca. 1043\u20131086), also known as Canute the Saint and Canute the Holy, and as [[patron saint]] of Denmark, minted coins in the town.{{sfn|Fodor|1964|p=163}} The peasants of Randers who rose up against him and his plans to attack [[England]] and its ruler, [[William the Conqueror]], assembled in this town. Their uprising led to the death of Canute.{{sfn|Christiansen|1980|p=254}}\nA [[chronicle]] written at [[Essenb\u00e6k Abbey]] tells of a fire that ravaged the city. The city was destroyed and rebuilt three times in the 13th century. In 1246, it was burned down by [[Abel of Denmark]]'s troops during the civil uprising against [[Eric IV of Denmark]]. On a street in the town center is the house where, according to legend, Danish nobleman and national hero [[Niels Ebbesen]] killed Count [[Gerhard III|Richard (Gerhard) III of Holstein]] on 1 April 1340, during the Kingless Times, when the entire country was pledged to German counts. This action led to further insurrection against the Germans. Ebbesen died in a large battle at [[Skanderborg#Skanderborg Castle|Skanderborg Castle]] in December 1340.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/niels-ebbesen-ca-1300-1340/|title=Niels Ebbesen |publisher=Danmarkshistorien.dk|accessdate=6 August 2014|language=Danish}}</ref> A statue to Ebbesen stands in front of Randers' Town Hall today.\n\nWhen King [[Valdemar IV of Denmark|Valdemar IV of Denmark (Valdemar Atterdag)]] tried to assemble a government in 1350 after the mortgaging to the Holsteiners, the town was further reinforced with protection, and was often named as ''Randershus'' (\"Randers Fortress\"). This fortification was captured by dissatisfied nobility in 1357. In 1359 Valdemar attacked the captured city with the strength of all of his forces.{{Sfn|Pierer|1858|p=705}} During medieval times the city prospered as a market town.{{sfn|Sale|2007|p=68}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:NIels Ebbesen hus.jpg|thumb|left|The half-timbered mechants house Niels Ebbesen's Gaard from 1643.

It prospered in the 15th and 16th centuries trading both nationally and overseas thanks to its harbour and cargo shipping maintained by competent craftsmen. Salmon fishing also contributed to the local economy.<ref name=dcfb>{{cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/koebstaeder/by.aspx?koebstadID=40|title=Randers: Byhistorie|publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|accessdate=17 April 2015 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\nThe town was fortified through much of the [[Middle Ages]]. Today, however, the only sign of [[defensive wall]]s is their existence in street names. These streets follow a circular path, presumably following the location of the historic walls. Street names include ''\u00d8stervold'' (\"Eastern Defense Wall\"), ''N\u00f8rreport'' (\"Northern Gate\"), ''Vestervold'' (\"Western Defense Wall\"), and ''Lille Voldgade'' (\"Little Defense Wall Street\").\n\nIn 1534 a farmers' uprising tried to storm the town unsuccessfully; it was part of wider regional peasant unrest affecting the Jutland region the same year, leading to the death of some 2000 by the sword in Aalborg alone.{{sfn|Murray|1858|p=87}} Massive moats were set up around the town under the rule of King [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]] (1536\u20131559). The town was already known for its glove-making in the Middle Ages but at the beginning of the 18th century the industry really prospered. During the second half of the 17th century, the town suffered not only from the Swedish wars but experienced the plague and extensive fires. From the mid-17th century, the economy began to thrive once more, the harbour was extended bringing an increase in shipping. By the end of the 18th century, it had become Jutland's largest town with 4,500 inhabitants.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\nDuring its peak there were almost 170 merchants' estates in the area, and a sizeable navy that sailed around the world. Some of these old [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] [[Estate (house)|estates]] and [[Manorialism|manor homes]] can still be seen in the town. Randers is known as Crown Jutland (''Kronjylland'') and its inhabitants as Crown Jutlanders (''Kronjyde''), probably due to its large estates owned by the monarchy. It was Denmark's poets who first started to use the term Kronjyde in the mid-18th century.<ref name=danishnet/> [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] (1783\u20131872) and [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1805\u20131875), and especially [[Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (1857\u20131943), used the term. The population in 1880 was 13,457.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Industrialisation and modern times===\n[[File:-Randers 1900.jpg|thumb|Map of Randers (1900).]]\nDuring the [[History of Denmark#Industrialisation|industrialisation]], Randers became a centre for the developing [[agricultural industry]] and a number of manufacturing businesses and heavy machinery factories also emerged. According to \"[[The Popular Encyclopedia; or, Conversations Lexicon]]\", Blackie & Son (c. 1890), Randers contained at that time an [[arsenal]], a classical school with six professors, and had several industrial establishments, including manufacturers of gloves, for which the town had long been famous. Randers was also known for salmon, rope, and pretty women. <!--(What is this about?)

In particular the crafts and industry sector grew and Randers became one of the most important industrial towns in Denmark. Trade and seafaring continued to be major sectors of the local economy and the harbour was expanded and improved several times during this era. With the opening of the first railway line to Aarhus in 1862, the barge-transports on the Guden River declined dramatically. This however paved the way for a booming railway manufacturing industry. Even though the population of Randers grew in these years, it was also the time, when the town was outpaced by Aarhus and Aalborg.<ref name=\"DMT\"/>\n\n[[File:Randers Handsker i lammeskind.JPG|thumb|Randers has been known for its glove production for centuries.]]\nThe [[gloves|glove]] factory of ''Randers Handskefabrik'' was established in 1811, and is considered among the oldest glove factories in the World. The manufacturing of gloves in Randers has been traced back to 1200s, in the 1600s it was the primary occupation here and from the 1700s the gloves became known abroad, with exports to Sweden, Germany, Russia, France and England. After some decades with declining productions, the factory was built, industrialising and boosting the productions, guided by the knowledge of the Parisian glovemaker [[Charles Mattat]]. Shops in London and New York were added to the company in 1892. In 1927, Randers Handsker were acquired by the Danish Vejrum family, who still owns and runs the company today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoflev.dk/article.asp?id=116|title=Kongelig Hofleverand\u00f8r \u2013 Randersk Handsker [By appointment to the Royal Danish Court \u2013 Randers Gloves] |publisher=Nostra |language=Danish|accessdate=8 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thor-Bier.jpg|thumb|left|Thor, a beer brand associated with the city of Randers.]]\nThe larger emerging industries included the [[Thor Brewery|Thor breweries]], founded in 1856 by the businessman [[Christian Emil Synnestvedt]], but built in 1850 by the Swedish entrepreneur [[Johan Peter Lindahl]]. The Thor breweries was an important industry and employer in Randers for many years and the beer brand of Thor is still associated with the city. The breweries closed in 2003, but Thor is still being produced, now by [[Royal Unibrew]] in [[Odense]], and there is a sales-office in Randers promoting the brand. The old factory buildings at Thorsgade is considered important for the history of beer brewing in Denmark and some of them are now listed by the Danish Cultural Agency.

It is the main town and the administrative seat of [[Herning Municipality]]. Herning has a population of 50,039 (1 January 2019)<ref>[https://m.statbank.dk/TableInfo/BY3?lang=en BY3: Population 1st January, by urban areas] The Mobile Statbank from [[Statistics Denmark]]</ref> including the suburbs of Tj\u00f8rring, Snejbjerg, Lind, Birk, Hammerum and Gjellerup, making Herning the 11th most populous [[urban area]] in Denmark.\n\n==History==\nHerning was established at the beginning of the 1790s, during the period of heath reclamation, as a commercial centre providing goods and services to the farmers in the area. A textile industry later developed in and around the town. This industry was once Herning's principal economic activity. Today, the town has a more diversified industrial base. Herning became a market town in 1913. Herning has twice been awarded the title of Danish City of the Year.\n\n==Industry==\nThere are many small furniture and textile businesses in and around Herning.<ref name=\"Pyke1992\">{{cite book|author=Frank Pyke|title=Industrial Development Through Small-firm Cooperation: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZ1EjXSg8VsC&pg=PR6|year=1992|publisher=International Labour Organization|isbn=978-92-2-108256-9|pages=6\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Attractions==\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Elia_Sculpture.jpg|thumb|[[Elia (Sculpture)]]- a sculpture near Herning {{speedy-image-c|2007-06-01}}]] -->\nHerning is home to [[Messecenter Herning]], the largest exhibition centre in [[Scandinavia]], which hosts many trade fairs.\n\n[[Carl-Henning Pedersen]] and [[Else Alfelt|Else Alfelt's]] Museum of Art (also known as Herning Art Museum) is located in the city.\n\nThe city is the site of three buildings designed by the architect [[J\u00f8rn Utzon]]. One is publicly owned and two are privately owned.\n\nThe town is also home to sculptor [[Ingvar Cronhammar]]'s monumental work [[Elia (sculpture)|Elia]]. The sculpture is located near the Herning Art Museum.\n\nThe old Herningsholm Estate in Herning is open to the public for touring.
