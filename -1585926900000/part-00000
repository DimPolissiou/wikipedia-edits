He first settled in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] in October 1854. On December 10, 1854, after helping to find a location for the new townsite of Topeka, he wrote a letter to his wife saying:\n\n<blockquote>I am now thirty miles above Lawrence on the Kansas River assisting in starting a new town.

In the 1890s he became mistakenly convinced that Ellis and Trego counties in central Kansas contained mineral deposits of [[tin]], [[zinc]], and [[gold]]. In 1899 his son [[Charles K.

Holliday's legal skills were called on again to create the paperwork for a new railroad.

It is the busiest airport in the island of [[Mindanao]] and the third busiest in the [[Philippines]] after [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in [[Manila]] and [[Mactan-Cebu International Airport]] in [[Lapu-Lapu, Philippines|Lapu-Lapu City]], [[Cebu]]. The airport has a single 3,000-meter precision [[runway]].\n\nA new terminal replaces the previous airport terminals, which lie just across it, in handling both domestic and international flights operating to and from Davao. The modern facility is designed to handle approximately 2 million passengers annually and 84,600 metric tons of cargo annually. The added capacity is also complemented by the latest navigational, security, and baggage handling equipment.\n\nThe modernization and upgrading of the airport facilities aims to make Davao as a hub for tourism and foreign investment in the region. Development was funded by a forty million-dollar loan from the [[Asian Development Bank]], co-financed by the [[European Investment Bank]] for twenty-five million [[European Currency Unit|ECUs]], and through budgetary allocations from the government. The total cost of the project amounted to $128 million.\n\nAfter almost a decade, the new terminal was finally inaugurated on December 2, 2003. Initial construction began in 2000 while plans for construction were announced in 1992.\n\nOn November 12, 2007, [[Cebu Pacific]] announced this airport as its third [[airline hub|hub]].<ref>{{cite press release |url= http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2007/11122007.html |title=Cebu Pacific to make Davao its 3rd hub |publisher=Cebu Pacific |date=2007-11-12 |accessdate=2007-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071117173016/http://www.cebupacificair.com/aboutus/press/2007/11122007.html |archivedate=2007-11-17}}</ref>\n\n[[Philippine Airlines]], the country's flag carrier, announced this airport as its third hub on March 26, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://businessmirror.com.ph/2018/03/26/hk-bangkok-eyed-for-next-foreign-route-of-pals-davao-hub/|title=Hong Kong, Bangkok eyed for next foreign route of PAL\u2019s Davao hub - Manuel Cayon|first=Manuel|last=Cayon|date=March 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nRepublic Act (RA) 11457, known as the Davao International Airport Authority charter, was signed by His Excellency [[Rodrigo Duterte|President Rodrigo Roa Duterte]] on August 30, 2019.

At the time it began operation, the airport merely consisted of a 1,200-meter unpaved grass runway and [[quonset hut]]s serving as terminal buildings. At the time, and throughout much of the 1940s and 1950s, both [[Philippine Airlines]] and the [[Philippine Air Force]] provided air service to the city.<ref name=\"earlyhistory\">{{cite news|author=Ajero, Antonio M. |title=Nonoy Garcia, Elias Lopez and other airport tales|url= http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2003/12/01/feat/nonoy.garcia.elias.lopez.and.other.airport.tales.html |publisher=[[Sun.Star]] Davao |date=2003-12-01 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20031221002204/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2003/12/01/feat/nonoy.garcia.elias.lopez.and.other.airport.tales.html |archivedate=2003-12-21 |accessdate=2008-12-14 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1959, the complex consisted of a small [[control tower]] and several low-rise buildings. Right of way and access to the terminal buildings and the airport was improved through further donation of land by Paciano Bangoy during the latter stages of his gubernatorial term. A new terminal designed by Filipino architect [[Leandro Locsin]], with a capacity of one million passengers, was constructed in 1980 and the runway was progressively extended from its original length of 1,200 meters to its current 3,000 meters. Both projects were funded during the term of then-Congressman Manuel Garcia, whose congressional district covers the airport perimeter.<ref name=\"earlyhistory\" />\n\nRapid growth at the airport precipitated the construction of a [[Philippine peso|\u20b1]]15 million interim international terminal beside the airport's then-existing terminal,<ref name=\"earlyhistory\" /> and then eventually a new, larger terminal building which would consolidate the two existing terminals. In planning since 1992, construction began in 2000 and subsequently inaugurated on December 2, 2003, with a capacity double that of the old airport terminal. The construction of the new P2.7 billion building was funded by both the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[European Investment Bank]].<ref name=\"earlyhistory\" /> The biggest aircraft to land in Francisco Bangoy International Airport is the [[Antonov An-124]] Ruslan (registration number UR-82027).

It is the busiest airport in the island of [[Mindanao]] and the third busiest in the [[Philippines]] after [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in [[Manila]] and [[Mactan-Cebu International Airport]] in [[Lapu-Lapu, Philippines|Lapu-Lapu City]], [[Cebu]]. The airport has a single 3,000-meter precision [[runway]].\n\nA new terminal replaces the previous airport terminals, which lie just across it, in handling both domestic and international flights operating to and from Davao. The modern facility is designed to handle approximately 2 million passengers annually and 84,600 metric tons of cargo annually. The added capacity is also complemented by the latest navigational, security, and baggage handling equipment.\n\nThe modernization and upgrading of the airport facilities aims to make Davao as a hub for tourism and foreign investment in the region. Development was funded by a forty million-dollar loan from the [[Asian Development Bank]], co-financed by the [[European Investment Bank]] for twenty-five million [[European Currency Unit|ECUs]], and through budgetary allocations from the government. The total cost of the project amounted to $128 million.\n\nAfter almost a decade, the new terminal was finally inaugurated on December 2, 2003.

At the time it began operation, the airport merely consisted of a 1,200-meter unpaved grass runway and [[quonset hut]]s serving as terminal buildings. At the time, and throughout much of the 1940s and 1950s, both [[Philippine Airlines]] and the [[Philippine Air Force]] provided air service to the city.<ref name=\"earlyhistory\">{{cite news|author=Ajero, Antonio M. |title=Nonoy Garcia, Elias Lopez and other airport tales|url= http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2003/12/01/feat/nonoy.garcia.elias.lopez.and.other.airport.tales.html |publisher=[[Sun.Star]] Davao |date=2003-12-01 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20031221002204/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2003/12/01/feat/nonoy.garcia.elias.lopez.and.other.airport.tales.html |archivedate=2003-12-21 |accessdate=2008-12-14 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1959, the complex consisted of a small [[control tower]] and several low-rise buildings. Right of way and access to the terminal buildings and the airport was improved through further donation of land by Paciano Bangoy during the latter stages of his gubernatorial term. A new terminal designed by Filipino architect [[Leandro Locsin]], with a capacity of one million passengers, was constructed in 1980 and the runway was progressively extended from its original length of 1,200 meters to its current 3,000 meters. Both projects were funded during the term of then-Congressman Manuel Garcia, whose congressional district covers the airport perimeter.<ref name=\"earlyhistory\" />\n\nRapid growth at the airport precipitated the construction of a [[Philippine peso|\u20b1]]15 million interim international terminal beside the airport's then-existing terminal,<ref name=\"earlyhistory\" /> and then eventually a new, larger terminal building which would consolidate the two existing terminals. In planning since 1992, construction began in 2000 and subsequently inaugurated on December 2, 2003, with a capacity double that of the old airport terminal. The construction of the new P2.7 billion building was funded by both the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[European Investment Bank]].<ref name=\"earlyhistory\" /> The biggest aircraft to land in Francisco Bangoy International Airport is the [[Antonov An-124]] Ruslan (registration number UR-82027).

Historically associated with [[right-wing politics]], the term has since been used to describe [[#Forms|a wide range of views]]. There is no single set of policies regarded as conservative because the meaning of conservatism depends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time. Thus conservatives from different parts of the world\u2014each upholding their respective traditions\u2014may disagree on a wide range of issues. [[Edmund Burke]], an 18th-century politician who opposed the French Revolution, but supported the [[American Revolution]], is credited as one of the main theorists of [[conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservatism in Great Britain in the 1790s]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank O'Gorman|title=Edmund Burke: His Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-reNJAnv1oC&pg=PA171|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=171|isbn=978-0-415-32684-1}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], the chairman of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1959: \"Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a timeless function in the development of a free society, and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Quintin Hogg Baron Hailsham of St. Marylebone|title=The Conservative Case|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22+attitude,+a+constant+force,+performing+a+timeless+function+in+the+development+of+a+free+society,+and+corresponding+to+a+deep+and+permanent+requirement+of+human+nature+itself%22|year=1959|publisher=Penguin Books}}</ref>\n\n== Forms ==\n=== Liberal conservatism ===\n{{main|Liberal conservatism}}\n[[Liberal conservatism]] incorporates the [[classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy. Individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} Liberal conservatism is a variant of conservatism that is strongly influenced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGNRRwkZFysC&pg=PA109|title=Analyzing Politics|last=Grigsby|first=Ellen|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-495-50112-1|location=|pages=108\u2013109, 112, 347|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAs these latter two terms have had different meanings over time and across countries, liberal conservatism also has a wide variety of meanings. Historically, the term often referred to the combination of [[economic liberalism]], which champions ''[[laissez-faire]]'' markets, with the classical conservatism concern for established [[tradition]], respect for authority and religious values. It contrasted itself with [[classical liberalism]], which supported [[freedom for the individual]] in both the economic and social spheres.\n\nOver time, the general conservative ideology in many countries adopted economic liberal arguments and the term liberal conservatism was replaced with conservatism. This is also the case in countries where liberal economic ideas have been the tradition such as the United States and are thus considered conservative. In other countries where liberal conservative movements have entered the political mainstream, such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], the terms liberal and conservative may be synonymous. The liberal conservative tradition in the United States combines the economic [[individualism]] of the classical liberals with a [[Burkean]] form of conservatism (which has also become part of the [[American conservative]] tradition, such as in the writings of [[Russell Kirk]]).\n\nA secondary meaning for the term liberal conservatism that has developed in [[Europe]] is a combination of more modern conservative (less traditionalist) views with those of [[social liberalism]]. This has developed as an opposition to the more [[collectivist]] views of [[socialism]]. Often this involves stressing what are now conservative views of [[free market]] economics and belief in individual responsibility, with social liberal views on defence of [[civil rights]], [[environmentalism]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. In continental Europe, this is sometimes also translated into English as social conservatism.\n\n=== Conservative liberalism ===\n{{main|Conservative liberalism}}\n[[Conservative liberalism]] is a variant of liberalism that combines liberal values and policies with conservative stances.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm Ipolitique.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319053712/http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm |date=March 19, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.de/contents.html|title=parties-and-elections.de}}</ref><ref name=\"Mair\">{{Cite book|title=Representative Government in Europe|last=Gallagher|first=M.|last2=Laver|first2=M.|last3=Mair|first3=P.|year=|isbn=|location=|page=221|quote=|author-link=Michael Gallagher (academic)|author-link3=Peter Mair|via=}}</ref> The roots of conservative liberalism are found at the beginning of the [[History of liberal thought|history of liberalism]].

Social conservatives may believe that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions;{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=69}} and that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or behaviours. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores, often by opposing what they consider radical policies or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]]. Social change is generally regarded as suspect.\n\nA second meaning of the term social conservatism developed in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[continental Europe]], where it refers to liberal conservatives supporting modern [[European welfare state]]s.\n\nSocial conservatives (in the first meaning of the phrase) in many countries generally favour the [[anti-abortion]] position in the [[abortion controversy]] and oppose human [[embryonic stem cell]] research (particularly if publicly funded); oppose both [[eugenics]] and [[human enhancement]] ([[transhumanism]]) while supporting [[bioconservatism]];<ref>[http://www.utne.com/2005-01-01/TheNextDigitalDivide.aspx?page=2 The Next Digital Divide] (utne article)</ref> support a traditional definition of marriage as being one man and one woman; view the [[nuclear family]] model as society's foundational unit; oppose expansion of [[civil marriage]] and [[child adoption]] to couples in [[same-sex relationship]]s; promote [[public morality]] and traditional [[family values]]; oppose [[atheism]],<ref>\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots.

He reports:\n<blockquote>Conservative or rightist extremist movements have arisen at different periods in modern history, ranging from the [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy|Horthyites]] in Hungary, the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Christian Social Party of Dollfuss in Austria]], the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]] and other nationalists in pre-Hitler Germany, and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar in Portugal]], to the pre-1966 Gaullist movements and the monarchists in contemporary France and Italy. The right extremists are conservative, not revolutionary. They seek to change political institutions in order to preserve or restore cultural and economic ones, while extremists of the centre and left seek to use political means for cultural and social revolution. The ideal of the right extremist is not a totalitarian ruler, but a monarch, or a traditionalist who acts like one. Many such movements in Spain, Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Italy-have been explicitly monarchist... The supporters of these movements differ from those of the centrists, tending to be wealthier, and more religious, which is more important in terms of a potential for mass support.<ref>Seymour M. Lipset, \"Social Stratification and 'Right-Wing Extremism'\" ''British Journal of Sociology'' 10#4 (1959), pp. 346-382 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/587800 on-line]</ref></blockquote>\n\n== History ==\n=== Development of Western conservatism ===\n==== United Kingdom ====\n{{main|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}\n{{Toryism|related}}\nIn Great Britain, conservative ideas (though not yet called that) emerged in the [[Tory]] movement during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period (1660\u20131688). Toryism supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]. [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] opposed the idea that sovereignty derived from the people and rejected the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha: or the Natural Power of Kings'' (published posthumously in 1680, but written before the [[English Civil War]] of 1642\u20131651) became accepted as the statement of their doctrine. However, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 destroyed this principle to some degree by establishing a constitutional government in England, leading to the hegemony of the Tory-opposed [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] ideology. Faced with defeat, the Tories reformed their movement, now holding that sovereignty was vested in the three estates of Crown, Lords and Commons<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=ix, 21}}</ref> rather than solely in the Crown. Toryism became marginalized during the long period of Whig ascendancy in the 18th century.\n\nConservatives typically see [[Richard Hooker]] (1554\u20131600) as the founding father of conservatism, along with the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]] (1633\u20131695), [[David Hume]] (1711\u20131776) and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729\u20131797). Halifax promoted pragmatism in government whilst Hume argued against political rationalism and utopianism.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Muller|editor1-first=Jerry Z.|title=Conservatism: an anthology of social and political thought from David Hume to the present|url=https://archive.org/details/conservatismanth00mull|url-access=registration|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wolin|first1=Sheldon S.|title=Hume and Conservatism|journal=American Political Science Review|date=2 September 2013|volume=48|issue=4|pages=999\u20131016|doi=10.2307/1951007|jstor=1951007}}</ref> Burke served as the private secretary to the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquis of Rockingham]] and as official pamphleteer to the [[Rockingham Whigs|Rockingham branch of the Whig party]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Edmund Burke: selected writings and speeches|last=Stanlis|first=Peter J.|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=18|quote=|via=}}</ref> Together with the Tories, they were the conservatives in the late 18th century United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book|author=M.

He supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u20131783, but abhorred the violence of the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u20131799). He accepted the liberal ideals of private property and the economics of [[Adam Smith]] (1723\u20131790), but thought that economics should remain subordinate to the conservative social ethic, that capitalism should be subordinate to the medieval social tradition and that the business class should be subordinate to [[aristocracy]]. He insisted on standards of honor derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition and saw the aristocracy as the nation's natural leaders.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=37\u201340|quote=|via=}}</ref> That meant limits on the powers of the Crown, since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive.

Despite their influence on future conservative thought, none of these early contributors were explicitly involved in Tory politics. Hooker lived in the 16th century, long before the advent of [[toryism]], whilst Hume was an apolitical philosopher and Halifax similarly politically independent. Burke described himself as a Whig.\n\n===== Revival =====\n[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edmund Burke]] (1729\u20131797)]]\nShortly after Burke's death in 1797, conservatism revived as a mainstream political force as the Whigs suffered a series of internal divisions. This new generation of conservatives derived their politics not from Burke, but from his predecessor, the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Viscount Bolingbroke]] (1678\u20131751), who was a Jacobite and traditional Tory, lacking Burke's sympathies for Whiggish policies such as [[Catholic emancipation]] and [[American Revolution|American independence]] (famously attacked by [[Samuel Johnson]] in \"Taxation No Tyranny\"). In the first half of the 19th century, many newspapers, magazines, and journals promoted loyalist or right-wing attitudes in religion, politics and international affairs. Burke was seldom mentioned, but [[William Pitt the Younger]] (1759\u20131806) became a conspicuous hero. The most prominent journals included ''The Quarterly Review'', founded in 1809 as a counterweight to the Whigs' ''Edinburgh Review'' and the even more conservative ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Sack finds that the ''Quarterly Review'' promoted a balanced Canningite toryism as it was neutral on Catholic emancipation and only mildly critical of Nonconformist Dissent; it opposed slavery and supported the current poor laws; and it was \"aggressively imperialist\". The [[high-church]] clergy of the Church of England read the ''[[Orthodox Churchman's Magazine]]'' which was equally hostile to Jewish, Catholic, [[Jacobin]], [[Methodist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] spokesmen. Anchoring the ultra Tories, ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' stood firmly against Catholic emancipation and favoured slavery, cheap money, mercantilism, the [[Navigation Acts]] and the [[Holy Alliance]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sack|first=J.

The effect was to significantly strengthen conservatism as a grassroots political force. Conservatism no longer was the philosophical defense of the landed aristocracy, but had been refreshed into redefining its commitment to the ideals of order, both secular and religious, expanding imperialism, strengthened monarchy and a more generous vision of the welfare state as opposed to the punitive vision of the Whigs and liberals.<ref>Gregory Claeys, \"Political Thought\", in Chris Williams, ed., ''A Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2006). p. 195</ref> As early as 1835, Disraeli attacked the Whigs and utilitarians as slavishly devoted to an industrial oligarchy, while he described his fellow Tories as the only \"really democratic party of England\" and devoted to the interests of the whole people.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Charles Richmond|author2=Paul Smith|title=The Self-Fashioning of Disraeli, 1818\u20131851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnF3IRJbKR8C&pg=PA162|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=162|isbn=978-0-521-49729-9}}</ref> Nevertheless, inside the party there was a tension between the growing numbers of wealthy businessmen on the one side and the aristocracy and rural gentry on the other.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=39\u201340|quote=|via=}}</ref> The aristocracy gained strength as businessmen discovered they could use their wealth to buy a peerage and a country estate.\n\nAlthough conservatives opposed attempts to allow greater representation of the middle class in parliament, they conceded that [[electoral reform]] could not be reversed and promised to support further reforms so long as they did not erode the institutions of church and state. These new principles were presented in the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] of 1834, which historians regard as the basic statement of the beliefs of the new Conservative Party.<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=79\u201380}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Peel Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robert Peel]] (1788\u20131850)]]\nSome conservatives lamented the passing of a pastoral world where the ethos of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' had promoted respect from the lower classes. They saw the [[Anglican Church]] and the aristocracy as balances against commercial wealth.<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=83}}</ref> They worked toward legislation for improved working conditions and urban housing.<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=90}}</ref> This viewpoint would later be called [[Tory democracy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=121}}</ref> However, since Burke, there has always been tension between traditional aristocratic conservatism and the wealthy business class.<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nIn 1834, Tory [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] in which he pledged to endorse moderate political reform. This marked the beginning of the transformation of British conservatism from [[High Tory]] reactionism towards a more modern form based on \"conservation\". The party became known as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] as a result, a name it has retained to this day. However, Peel would also be the root of a split in the party between the traditional Tories (led by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]) and the \"Peelites\" (led first by Peel himself, then by the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]]). The split occurred in 1846 over the issue of [[free trade]], which Peel supported, versus [[protectionism]], supported by Derby. The majority of the party sided with Derby whilst about a third split away, eventually merging with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[radicalism (politics)|radicals]] to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Despite the split, the mainstream Conservative Party accepted the doctrine of free trade in 1852.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the Liberal Party faced political schisms, especially over [[History of Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Home Rule]]. Leader [[William Gladstone]] (himself a former Peelite) sought to give Ireland a degree of autonomy, a move that elements in both the left and right-wings of his party opposed. These split off to become the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] (led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]]), forming a coalition with the Conservatives before merging with them in 1912. The Liberal Unionist influence dragged the Conservative Party towards the left as Conservative governments passing a number of progressive reforms at the turn of the 20th century. By the late 19th century, the traditional business supporters of the Liberal Party had joined the Conservatives, making them the party of [[business]] and [[commerce]].<ref>{{cite book|title=|last=Feuchtwanger|year=|isbn=|location=|page=273|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAfter a period of Liberal dominance before the [[First World War]], the Conservatives gradually became more influential in government, regaining full control of the cabinet in 1922.

It was influenced by [[Counter-Enlightenment]] works by men such as [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Louis de Bonald]]. Many continental or traditionalist conservatives do not support [[separation of church and state]], with most supporting state recognition of and cooperation with the [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]], such as had existed in France before the Revolution.\n\nEventually, conservatives added [[Gaullism]], [[patriotism]], and [[nationalism]] to the list of traditional values they support.

Bismarck's \"balance of power\" model maintained peace in Europe for decades at the end of the 19th century.

[[Liberty]] within the bounds of conformity to conservatism is a core value, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the [[free market]], limiting the size and scope of government and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur.\n\nThe major conservative party in the United States is the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], also known as the GOP (Grand Old Party). American conservatives consider [[individualism|individual liberty]], as long as it conforms to conservative values, [[small government]], [[deregulation]] of the government, [[economic liberalism]], and [[free trade]], as the fundamental traits of democracy, which contrasts with [[Modern Liberalism in the United States|modern American liberals]], who generally place a greater value on [[social equality]] and [[social justice]].<ref>Gregory L.

Both conservative and liberal parties tend to favor private ownership of property, in opposition to communist, socialist and green parties, which favor communal ownership or laws requiring social responsibility on the part of property owners. Where conservatives and liberals differ is primarily on social issues. Conservatives tend to reject behavior that does not [[conformity|conform]] to some [[social norm]]. Modern conservative parties often define themselves by their opposition to liberal or labor parties. The United States usage of the term \"conservative\" is unique to that country.<ref>Ware, Alan.

Mostly, this has been achieved through control of and support for civil institutions, the church and the armed forces, rather than through party politics. Typically, the church was exempt from taxes and its employees immune from civil prosecution. Where national conservative parties were weak or non-existent, conservatives were more likely to rely on military dictatorship as a preferred form of government. However, in some nations where the elites were able to mobilize popular support for conservative parties, longer periods of political stability were achieved.

They developed in the socio-economic and political cleavages that existed during the first three decades of the 19th century and had the support of the business, professional and established Church (Anglican) elites in Ontario and to a lesser extent in Quebec. Holding a monopoly over administrative and judicial offices, they were called the \"[[Family Compact]]\" in Ontario and the \"[[Chateau Clique]]\" in Quebec. [[John A. Macdonald]]'s successful leadership of the movement to confederate the provinces and his subsequent tenure as prime minister for most of the late 19th century rested on his ability to bring together the English-speaking Protestant oligarchy and the [[ultramontane]] Catholic hierarchy of Quebec and to keep them united in a conservative coalition.<ref>Kornberg, Allan and Mishler, William. ''Influence in Parliament, Canada''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1976. p. 38</ref>\n\nThe conservatives combined [[Economic liberalism|pro-market liberalism]] and [[Toryism]]. They generally supported an activist government and state intervention in the marketplace and their policies were marked by ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', a paternalistic responsibility of the elites for the less well-off.<ref>Schultze, Rainer-Olaf; Sturm, Roland and Eberle, Dagmar.

It slowly started to revive at the [[1994 Quebec general election|1994 provincial election]] with the [[Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec]], who served as [[Parliamentary opposition|Offical opposition]] in the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] from 2007 to 2008, before its merger with [[Fran\u00e7ois Legault|Fran\u00e7ois Legault's]] [[Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec]] in 2012, that took power in 2018.\n\nThe modern [[Conservative Party of Canada]] has rebranded conservatism and under the leadership of [[Stephen Harper]], the Conservative Party added more conservative policies.\n\n==== Colombia ====\n{{main|Conservatism in Colombia}}\nThe [[Colombian Conservative Party]], founded in 1849, traces its origins to opponents of General [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]'s 1833\u20131837 administration. While the term \"liberal\" had been used to describe all political forces in Colombia, the conservatives began describing themselves as \"conservative liberals\" and their opponents as \"red liberals\". From the 1860s until the present, the party has supported strong central government; supported the Catholic Church, especially its role as protector of the sanctity of the family; and opposed separation of church and state. Its policies include the legal equality of all men, the citizen's right to own property and opposition to dictatorship.

Both it and the Liberal party were suppressed by the authoritarian, arch-conservative and royalist [[4th of August Regime]] of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] in 1936\u20131941. The PP was able to re-group after the Second World War as part of a United Nationalist Front which achieved power campaigning on a simple anticommunist, ultranationalist platform during the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u20131949). However, the vote received by the PP declined during the so-called \"Centrist Interlude\" in 1950\u20131952. In 1952, Marshal [[Alexandros Papagos]] created the [[Greek Rally]] as an umbrella for the right-wing forces. The Greek Rally came to power in 1952 and remained the leading party in Greece until 1963\u2014after Papagos' death in 1955 reformed as the [[National Radical Union]] under [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]. Right-wing governments backed by the palace and the army overthrew the [[Centre Union]] government in 1965 and governed the country until the establishment of the far-right [[Regime of the Colonels]] (1967\u20131974). After the [[metapolitefsi|regime's collapse]] in August 1974, Karamanlis returned from exile to lead the government and founded the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party. The new conservative party had four objectives: to confront [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish expansionism in Cyprus]], to reestablish and solidify democratic rule, to give the country a strong government and to make a powerful moderate party a force in Greek politics.<ref>Penniman, Howard Rae.

From the beginning, they have been the largest vote-winning party, averaging around 40%. They combined liberalism and conservatism, supported nationalization of infrastructure and opposed class conflict. While mostly in opposition during the 1930s, they embraced [[economic liberalism]], but accepted the welfare state after the war and participated in governments supportive of state intervention and protectionism.

The SVP emphasized agricultural policy and was strong among farmers in German-speaking Protestant areas. As Switzerland considered closer relations with the European Union in the 1990s, the SVP adopted a more militant protectionist and isolationist stance.

Australia undertook significant economic reform under the Labor Party in the mid-1980s. Consequently, issues like protectionism, welfare reform, privatization and deregulation are no longer debated in the political space as they are in Europe or North America.

Officially, DC refused the ideology of conservatism, but in many aspects, for example [[family values]], it was a typical [[social conservative]] party.\n\nIn 1994, the media tycoon and entrepreneur [[Silvio Berlusconi]] founded the [[liberal conservative]] party [[Forza Italia]] (FI). Berlusconi won three elections in [[1994 Italian general election|1994]], [[2001 Italian general election|2001]] and [[2008 Italian general election|2008]], governing the country for almost ten years as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]]. Forza Italia formed a coalition with right-wing regional party [[Lega Nord]] while in government.\n\nBesides FI, now the conservative ideas are mainly expressed by the [[New Centre-Right]] party led by [[Angelino Alfano]], Berlusconi formed a new party, which is a rebirth of [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]], thuds founding a new conservative movement. Alfano served as [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. After the [[2018 Italian general election|2018 election]], [[Lega Nord]] and the [[Five Star Movement]] formed the current [[right-wing populist]] government.\n\n==== Russia ====\nUnder [[Vladimir Putin]], the dominant leader since 1999, Russia has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and economic liberalism. Russian conservatism is unique in some respects as it supports [[Economic interventionism|Economic intervention]] with a [[mixed economy]], with a strong [[Russian nationalism|nationalist sentiment]] and [[social conservatism]] with its views being largely [[Right-wing populism|populist]]. Russian conservatism as a result opposes [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian]] ideals such as the aforementioned concept of [[economic liberalism]] found in other conservative movements around the world. Putin has as a result promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by Aleksandr Prokhanov, stresses Russian nationalism, the restoration of Russia's historical greatness and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.<ref>Marlene Laruelle, \"[https://www.academia.edu/download/49116221/Russian_Review-Izborskii_Klub.pdf The Izborsky Club, or the New Conservative Avant\u2010Garde in Russia]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}.\" ''Russian Review'' 75.4 (2016): 626\u2013644.</ref> [[Vladislav Surkov]], a senior government official, has been one of the key ideologists during Putin's presidency.<ref>Sirke M\u00e4kinen, \"Surkovian narrative on the future of Russia: making Russia a world leader.\" ''Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics'' 27#2 (2011): 143\u2013165.</ref>\n\nIn cultural and social affairs, Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

First it was the Democratic-Republican Party (1963\u20131980) and its head was [[Park Chung-hee]], who seized power in a 1961 military coup d'\u00e9tat and ruled as an unelected military strongman until his formal election as President in [[1963 South Korean presidential election|1963]]. He was President for 16 years until his assassination on 26 October 1979. The [[Democratic Justice Party]] inherited the same ideology as the Democratic-Republican Party. Its head, [[Chun Doo-hwan]], also gained power through a coup and his followers called themselves the Hanahae. The Democratic Justice Party changed its form and acted to suppress the opposition party and to follow the people's demand for direct elections. The party's [[Roh Tae-woo]] became the first President who was elected through direct election. The next form of the major conservative party was the Democratic-Liberal Party and again through election its second leader, [[Kim Young-sam]], became the fourteenth President of Korea. When the conservative party was beaten by the opposition party in the general election, it changed its form again to follow the party members' demand for reforms. It became the New Korean Party, but it changed again one year later since the President Kim Young-sam was blamed by the citizen for the [[International Monetary Fund]].{{clarify|date=March 2014}} It changed its name to Grand National Party (GNP). Since the late [[Kim Dae-jung]] assumed the presidency in 1998, GNP had been the opposition party until [[Lee Myung-bak]] won the presidential election of [[2007 South Korean presidential election|2007]].\n\n==== United States ====\n{{main|Conservatism in the United States}}\n[[File:President Reagan speaking in Minneapolis 1982.jpg|thumb|[[President of the United States]] [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981\u20131989), whose [[Reagan Doctrine]] has reshaped the Republican Party]]\nThe meaning of \"conservatism\" in the United States has little in common with the way the word is used elsewhere.

Historically associated with [[right-wing politics]], the term has since been used to describe [[#Forms|a wide range of views]]. There is no single set of policies regarded as conservative because the meaning of conservatism depends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time. Thus conservatives from different parts of the world\u2014each upholding their respective traditions\u2014may disagree on a wide range of issues. [[Edmund Burke]], an 18th-century politician who opposed the French Revolution, but supported the [[American Revolution]], is credited as one of the main theorists of [[conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservatism in Great Britain in the 1790s]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank O'Gorman|title=Edmund Burke: His Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-reNJAnv1oC&pg=PA171|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=171|isbn=978-0-415-32684-1}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], the chairman of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1959: \"Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a timeless function in the development of a free society, and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Quintin Hogg Baron Hailsham of St. Marylebone|title=The Conservative Case|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22+attitude,+a+constant+force,+performing+a+timeless+function+in+the+development+of+a+free+society,+and+corresponding+to+a+deep+and+permanent+requirement+of+human+nature+itself%22|year=1959|publisher=Penguin Books}}</ref>\n\n== Forms ==\n=== Liberal conservatism ===\n{{main|Liberal conservatism}}\n[[Liberal conservatism]] incorporates the [[classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy. Individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} Liberal conservatism is a variant of conservatism that is strongly influenced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGNRRwkZFysC&pg=PA109|title=Analyzing Politics|last=Grigsby|first=Ellen|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-495-50112-1|location=|pages=108\u2013109, 112, 347|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAs these latter two terms have had different meanings over time and across countries, liberal conservatism also has a wide variety of meanings. Historically, the term often referred to the combination of [[economic liberalism]], which champions ''[[laissez-faire]]'' markets, with the classical conservatism concern for established [[tradition]], respect for authority and religious values. It contrasted itself with [[classical liberalism]], which supported [[freedom for the individual]] in both the economic and social spheres.\n\nOver time, the general conservative ideology in many countries adopted economic liberal arguments and the term liberal conservatism was replaced with conservatism. This is also the case in countries where liberal economic ideas have been the tradition such as the United States and are thus considered conservative. In other countries where liberal conservative movements have entered the political mainstream, such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], the terms liberal and conservative may be synonymous. The liberal conservative tradition in the United States combines the economic [[individualism]] of the classical liberals with a [[Burkean]] form of conservatism (which has also become part of the [[American conservative]] tradition, such as in the writings of [[Russell Kirk]]).\n\nA secondary meaning for the term liberal conservatism that has developed in [[Europe]] is a combination of more modern conservative (less traditionalist) views with those of [[social liberalism]]. This has developed as an opposition to the more [[collectivist]] views of [[socialism]]. Often this involves stressing what are now conservative views of [[free market]] economics and belief in individual responsibility, with social liberal views on defence of [[civil rights]], [[environmentalism]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. In continental Europe, this is sometimes also translated into English as social conservatism.\n\n=== Conservative liberalism ===\n{{main|Conservative liberalism}}\n[[Conservative liberalism]] is a variant of liberalism that combines liberal values and policies with conservative stances.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm Ipolitique.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319053712/http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm |date=March 19, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.de/contents.html|title=parties-and-elections.de}}</ref><ref name=\"Mair\">{{Cite book|title=Representative Government in Europe|last=Gallagher|first=M.|last2=Laver|first2=M.|last3=Mair|first3=P.|year=|isbn=|location=|page=221|quote=|author-link=Michael Gallagher (academic)|author-link3=Peter Mair|via=}}</ref> The roots of conservative liberalism are found at the beginning of the [[History of liberal thought|history of liberalism]].

As such, national conservatives can be distinguished from economic conservatives, for whom free market economic policies, [[deregulation]] and fiscal conservatism are the main priorities. Some commentators have identified a growing gap between national and economic conservatism: \"[M]ost parties of the Right [today] are run by economic conservatives who, in varying degrees, have marginalized social, cultural, and national conservatives\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041121224135/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v49/ai_19559422 National questions \u2013 conservatives fragmenting as liberals unite], National Review, June 30, 1997</ref> National conservatism is also related to [[traditionalist conservatism]].\n\nTraditionalist conservatism is a political philosophy emphasizing the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[tradition]], [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]] as well as the intersecting spheres of loyalty.<ref>Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O.

In the United States, the term \"cultural conservative\" may imply a conservative position in the [[culture war]]. Cultural conservatives hold fast to traditional ways of thinking even in the face of monumental change. They believe strongly in traditional values and traditional politics and often have an urgent sense of nationalism.\n\n[[Social conservatism]] is distinct from cultural conservatism, although there are some overlaps. Social conservatives may believe that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions;{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=69}} and that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or behaviours. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores, often by opposing what they consider radical policies or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]]. Social change is generally regarded as suspect.\n\nA second meaning of the term social conservatism developed in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[continental Europe]], where it refers to liberal conservatives supporting modern [[European welfare state]]s.\n\nSocial conservatives (in the first meaning of the phrase) in many countries generally favour the [[anti-abortion]] position in the [[abortion controversy]] and oppose human [[embryonic stem cell]] research (particularly if publicly funded); oppose both [[eugenics]] and [[human enhancement]] ([[transhumanism]]) while supporting [[bioconservatism]];<ref>[http://www.utne.com/2005-01-01/TheNextDigitalDivide.aspx?page=2 The Next Digital Divide] (utne article)</ref> support a traditional definition of marriage as being one man and one woman; view the [[nuclear family]] model as society's foundational unit; oppose expansion of [[civil marriage]] and [[child adoption]] to couples in [[same-sex relationship]]s; promote [[public morality]] and traditional [[family values]]; oppose [[atheism]],<ref>\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots.

Since it is consistent with principles such as [[Organic unity|organicism]], [[hierarchy]] and [[duty]], it can be seen as an outgrowth of [[traditional conservatism]]. Paternal conservatives support neither the [[individual]] nor the [[State (polity)|state]] in principle, but are instead prepared to support either or recommend a balance between the two depending on what is most practical.{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=80}}\n\nIt stresses the importance of a [[social safety net]] to deal with [[poverty]], support of limited [[redistribution of wealth]] along with government regulation of markets in the interests of both consumers and producers.<ref name=\"Patrick Dunleavy 2000. pp. 107\u2013108\">Patrick Dunleavy, Paul Joseph Kelly, Michael Moran.

Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 21</ref> The hostility between the two ideologies is highlighted by the struggle for power for the [[Austrian National Socialism|National Socialists]] in Austria, which was marked by the assassination of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]].\n\nSociologist [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] has examined the class basis of right-wing extremist politics in the 1920\u20131960 era. He reports:\n<blockquote>Conservative or rightist extremist movements have arisen at different periods in modern history, ranging from the [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy|Horthyites]] in Hungary, the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Christian Social Party of Dollfuss in Austria]], the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]] and other nationalists in pre-Hitler Germany, and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar in Portugal]], to the pre-1966 Gaullist movements and the monarchists in contemporary France and Italy. The right extremists are conservative, not revolutionary. They seek to change political institutions in order to preserve or restore cultural and economic ones, while extremists of the centre and left seek to use political means for cultural and social revolution. The ideal of the right extremist is not a totalitarian ruler, but a monarch, or a traditionalist who acts like one. Many such movements in Spain, Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Italy-have been explicitly monarchist... The supporters of these movements differ from those of the centrists, tending to be wealthier, and more religious, which is more important in terms of a potential for mass support.<ref>Seymour M. Lipset, \"Social Stratification and 'Right-Wing Extremism'\" ''British Journal of Sociology'' 10#4 (1959), pp. 346-382 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/587800 on-line]</ref></blockquote>\n\n== History ==\n=== Development of Western conservatism ===\n==== United Kingdom ====\n{{main|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}\n{{Toryism|related}}\nIn Great Britain, conservative ideas (though not yet called that) emerged in the [[Tory]] movement during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period (1660\u20131688). Toryism supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]. [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] opposed the idea that sovereignty derived from the people and rejected the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha: or the Natural Power of Kings'' (published posthumously in 1680, but written before the [[English Civil War]] of 1642\u20131651) became accepted as the statement of their doctrine. However, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 destroyed this principle to some degree by establishing a constitutional government in England, leading to the hegemony of the Tory-opposed [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] ideology. Faced with defeat, the Tories reformed their movement, now holding that sovereignty was vested in the three estates of Crown, Lords and Commons<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=ix, 21}}</ref> rather than solely in the Crown. Toryism became marginalized during the long period of Whig ascendancy in the 18th century.\n\nConservatives typically see [[Richard Hooker]] (1554\u20131600) as the founding father of conservatism, along with the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]] (1633\u20131695), [[David Hume]] (1711\u20131776) and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729\u20131797). Halifax promoted pragmatism in government whilst Hume argued against political rationalism and utopianism.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Muller|editor1-first=Jerry Z.|title=Conservatism: an anthology of social and political thought from David Hume to the present|url=https://archive.org/details/conservatismanth00mull|url-access=registration|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wolin|first1=Sheldon S.|title=Hume and Conservatism|journal=American Political Science Review|date=2 September 2013|volume=48|issue=4|pages=999\u20131016|doi=10.2307/1951007|jstor=1951007}}</ref> Burke served as the private secretary to the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquis of Rockingham]] and as official pamphleteer to the [[Rockingham Whigs|Rockingham branch of the Whig party]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Edmund Burke: selected writings and speeches|last=Stanlis|first=Peter J.|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=18|quote=|via=}}</ref> Together with the Tories, they were the conservatives in the late 18th century United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite book|author=M.

He supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u20131783, but abhorred the violence of the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u20131799). He accepted the liberal ideals of private property and the economics of [[Adam Smith]] (1723\u20131790), but thought that economics should remain subordinate to the conservative social ethic, that capitalism should be subordinate to the medieval social tradition and that the business class should be subordinate to [[aristocracy]]. He insisted on standards of honor derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition and saw the aristocracy as the nation's natural leaders.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=37\u201340|quote=|via=}}</ref> That meant limits on the powers of the Crown, since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive.

Despite their influence on future conservative thought, none of these early contributors were explicitly involved in Tory politics. Hooker lived in the 16th century, long before the advent of [[toryism]], whilst Hume was an apolitical philosopher and Halifax similarly politically independent. Burke described himself as a Whig.\n\n===== Revival =====\n[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edmund Burke]] (1729\u20131797)]]\nShortly after Burke's death in 1797, conservatism revived as a mainstream political force as the Whigs suffered a series of internal divisions. This new generation of conservatives derived their politics not from Burke, but from his predecessor, the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Viscount Bolingbroke]] (1678\u20131751), who was a Jacobite and traditional Tory, lacking Burke's sympathies for Whiggish policies such as [[Catholic emancipation]] and [[American Revolution|American independence]] (famously attacked by [[Samuel Johnson]] in \"Taxation No Tyranny\"). In the first half of the 19th century, many newspapers, magazines, and journals promoted loyalist or right-wing attitudes in religion, politics and international affairs. Burke was seldom mentioned, but [[William Pitt the Younger]] (1759\u20131806) became a conspicuous hero. The most prominent journals included ''The Quarterly Review'', founded in 1809 as a counterweight to the Whigs' ''Edinburgh Review'' and the even more conservative ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Sack finds that the ''Quarterly Review'' promoted a balanced Canningite toryism as it was neutral on Catholic emancipation and only mildly critical of Nonconformist Dissent; it opposed slavery and supported the current poor laws; and it was \"aggressively imperialist\". The [[high-church]] clergy of the Church of England read the ''[[Orthodox Churchman's Magazine]]'' which was equally hostile to Jewish, Catholic, [[Jacobin]], [[Methodist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] spokesmen. Anchoring the ultra Tories, ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' stood firmly against Catholic emancipation and favoured slavery, cheap money, mercantilism, the [[Navigation Acts]] and the [[Holy Alliance]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sack|first=J.

The effect was to significantly strengthen conservatism as a grassroots political force. Conservatism no longer was the philosophical defense of the landed aristocracy, but had been refreshed into redefining its commitment to the ideals of order, both secular and religious, expanding imperialism, strengthened monarchy and a more generous vision of the welfare state as opposed to the punitive vision of the Whigs and liberals.<ref>Gregory Claeys, \"Political Thought\", in Chris Williams, ed., ''A Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2006). p. 195</ref> As early as 1835, Disraeli attacked the Whigs and utilitarians as slavishly devoted to an industrial oligarchy, while he described his fellow Tories as the only \"really democratic party of England\" and devoted to the interests of the whole people.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Charles Richmond|author2=Paul Smith|title=The Self-Fashioning of Disraeli, 1818\u20131851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnF3IRJbKR8C&pg=PA162|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=162|isbn=978-0-521-49729-9}}</ref> Nevertheless, inside the party there was a tension between the growing numbers of wealthy businessmen on the one side and the aristocracy and rural gentry on the other.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=39\u201340|quote=|via=}}</ref> The aristocracy gained strength as businessmen discovered they could use their wealth to buy a peerage and a country estate.\n\nAlthough conservatives opposed attempts to allow greater representation of the middle class in parliament, they conceded that [[electoral reform]] could not be reversed and promised to support further reforms so long as they did not erode the institutions of church and state. These new principles were presented in the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] of 1834, which historians regard as the basic statement of the beliefs of the new Conservative Party.<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=79\u201380}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Peel Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robert Peel]] (1788\u20131850)]]\nSome conservatives lamented the passing of a pastoral world where the ethos of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' had promoted respect from the lower classes. They saw the [[Anglican Church]] and the aristocracy as balances against commercial wealth.<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=83}}</ref> They worked toward legislation for improved working conditions and urban housing.<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=90}}</ref> This viewpoint would later be called [[Tory democracy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|p=121}}</ref> However, since Burke, there has always been tension between traditional aristocratic conservatism and the wealthy business class.<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nIn 1834, Tory [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]] issued the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] in which he pledged to endorse moderate political reform. This marked the beginning of the transformation of British conservatism from [[High Tory]] reactionism towards a more modern form based on \"conservation\". The party became known as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] as a result, a name it has retained to this day. However, Peel would also be the root of a split in the party between the traditional Tories (led by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]) and the \"Peelites\" (led first by Peel himself, then by the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]]). The split occurred in 1846 over the issue of [[free trade]], which Peel supported, versus [[protectionism]], supported by Derby. The majority of the party sided with Derby whilst about a third split away, eventually merging with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[radicalism (politics)|radicals]] to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Despite the split, the mainstream Conservative Party accepted the doctrine of free trade in 1852.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the Liberal Party faced political schisms, especially over [[History of Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Home Rule]]. Leader [[William Gladstone]] (himself a former Peelite) sought to give Ireland a degree of autonomy, a move that elements in both the left and right-wings of his party opposed. These split off to become the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] (led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]]), forming a coalition with the Conservatives before merging with them in 1912. The Liberal Unionist influence dragged the Conservative Party towards the left as Conservative governments passing a number of progressive reforms at the turn of the 20th century.

[[Liberty]] within the bounds of conformity to conservatism is a core value, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the [[free market]], limiting the size and scope of government and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur.\n\nThe major conservative party in the United States is the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], also known as the GOP (Grand Old Party). American conservatives consider [[individualism|individual liberty]], as long as it conforms to conservative values, [[small government]], [[deregulation]] of the government, [[economic liberalism]], and [[free trade]], as the fundamental traits of democracy, which contrasts with [[Modern Liberalism in the United States|modern American liberals]], who generally place a greater value on [[social equality]] and [[social justice]].<ref>Gregory L.

Both conservative and liberal parties tend to favor private ownership of property, in opposition to communist, socialist and green parties, which favor communal ownership or laws requiring social responsibility on the part of property owners. Where conservatives and liberals differ is primarily on social issues. Conservatives tend to reject behavior that does not [[conformity|conform]] to some [[social norm]]. Modern conservative parties often define themselves by their opposition to liberal or labor parties. The United States usage of the term \"conservative\" is unique to that country.<ref>Ware, Alan.

Mostly, this has been achieved through control of and support for civil institutions, the church and the armed forces, rather than through party politics. Typically, the church was exempt from taxes and its employees immune from civil prosecution. Where national conservative parties were weak or non-existent, conservatives were more likely to rely on military dictatorship as a preferred form of government. However, in some nations where the elites were able to mobilize popular support for conservative parties, longer periods of political stability were achieved.

They developed in the socio-economic and political cleavages that existed during the first three decades of the 19th century and had the support of the business, professional and established Church (Anglican) elites in Ontario and to a lesser extent in Quebec. Holding a monopoly over administrative and judicial offices, they were called the \"[[Family Compact]]\" in Ontario and the \"[[Chateau Clique]]\" in Quebec. [[John A. Macdonald]]'s successful leadership of the movement to confederate the provinces and his subsequent tenure as prime minister for most of the late 19th century rested on his ability to bring together the English-speaking Protestant oligarchy and the [[ultramontane]] Catholic hierarchy of Quebec and to keep them united in a conservative coalition.<ref>Kornberg, Allan and Mishler, William. ''Influence in Parliament, Canada''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1976. p. 38</ref>\n\nThe conservatives combined [[Economic liberalism|pro-market liberalism]] and [[Toryism]].

While the term \"liberal\" had been used to describe all political forces in Colombia, the conservatives began describing themselves as \"conservative liberals\" and their opponents as \"red liberals\". From the 1860s until the present, the party has supported strong central government; supported the Catholic Church, especially its role as protector of the sanctity of the family; and opposed separation of church and state.

Both it and the Liberal party were suppressed by the authoritarian, arch-conservative and royalist [[4th of August Regime]] of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] in 1936\u20131941. The PP was able to re-group after the Second World War as part of a United Nationalist Front which achieved power campaigning on a simple anticommunist, ultranationalist platform during the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u20131949). However, the vote received by the PP declined during the so-called \"Centrist Interlude\" in 1950\u20131952. In 1952, Marshal [[Alexandros Papagos]] created the [[Greek Rally]] as an umbrella for the right-wing forces. The Greek Rally came to power in 1952 and remained the leading party in Greece until 1963\u2014after Papagos' death in 1955 reformed as the [[National Radical Union]] under [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]. Right-wing governments backed by the palace and the army overthrew the [[Centre Union]] government in 1965 and governed the country until the establishment of the far-right [[Regime of the Colonels]] (1967\u20131974). After the [[metapolitefsi|regime's collapse]] in August 1974, Karamanlis returned from exile to lead the government and founded the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party. The new conservative party had four objectives: to confront [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish expansionism in Cyprus]], to reestablish and solidify democratic rule, to give the country a strong government and to make a powerful moderate party a force in Greek politics.<ref>Penniman, Howard Rae.

From the beginning, they have been the largest vote-winning party, averaging around 40%. They combined liberalism and conservatism, supported nationalization of infrastructure and opposed class conflict. While mostly in opposition during the 1930s, they embraced [[economic liberalism]], but accepted the welfare state after the war and participated in governments supportive of state intervention and protectionism. Unlike other Scandanivian conservative (and liberal) parties, it has always had a large working-class following.<ref>Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors.

It formed its first government under parliamentarism in 1889 and continued to alternate in power with the Liberals until the 1930s, when Labour became the dominant political party. It has elements both of paternalism, stressing the responsibilities of the state, and of economic liberalism. It first returned to power in the 1960s.<ref>[[Knut Heidar|Heidar, Knut]].

The SVP emphasized agricultural policy and was strong among farmers in German-speaking Protestant areas. As Switzerland considered closer relations with the European Union in the 1990s, the SVP adopted a more militant protectionist and isolationist stance. This stance has allowed it to expand into German-speaking Catholic mountainous areas.<ref>Siaroff, Alan ''Comparative European Party Systems''.

Officially, DC refused the ideology of conservatism, but in many aspects, for example [[family values]], it was a typical [[social conservative]] party.\n\nIn 1994, the media tycoon and entrepreneur [[Silvio Berlusconi]] founded the [[liberal conservative]] party [[Forza Italia]] (FI). Berlusconi won three elections in [[1994 Italian general election|1994]], [[2001 Italian general election|2001]] and [[2008 Italian general election|2008]], governing the country for almost ten years as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]]. Forza Italia formed a coalition with right-wing regional party [[Lega Nord]] while in government.\n\nBesides FI, now the conservative ideas are mainly expressed by the [[New Centre-Right]] party led by [[Angelino Alfano]], Berlusconi formed a new party, which is a rebirth of [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]], thuds founding a new conservative movement. Alfano served as [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. After the [[2018 Italian general election|2018 election]], [[Lega Nord]] and the [[Five Star Movement]] formed the current [[right-wing populist]] government.\n\n==== Russia ====\nUnder [[Vladimir Putin]], the dominant leader since 1999, Russia has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and economic liberalism. Russian conservatism is unique in some respects as it supports [[Economic interventionism|Economic intervention]] with a [[mixed economy]], with a strong [[Russian nationalism|nationalist sentiment]] and [[social conservatism]] with its views being largely [[Right-wing populism|populist]]. Russian conservatism as a result opposes [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian]] ideals such as the aforementioned concept of [[economic liberalism]] found in other conservative movements around the world. Putin has as a result promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by Aleksandr Prokhanov, stresses Russian nationalism, the restoration of Russia's historical greatness and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.<ref>Marlene Laruelle, \"[https://www.academia.edu/download/49116221/Russian_Review-Izborskii_Klub.pdf The Izborsky Club, or the New Conservative Avant\u2010Garde in Russia]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}.\" ''Russian Review'' 75.4 (2016): 626\u2013644.</ref> [[Vladislav Surkov]], a senior government official, has been one of the key ideologists during Putin's presidency.<ref>Sirke M\u00e4kinen, \"Surkovian narrative on the future of Russia: making Russia a world leader.\" ''Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics'' 27#2 (2011): 143\u2013165.</ref>\n\nIn cultural and social affairs, Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

First it was the Democratic-Republican Party (1963\u20131980) and its head was [[Park Chung-hee]], who seized power in a 1961 military coup d'\u00e9tat and ruled as an unelected military strongman until his formal election as President in [[1963 South Korean presidential election|1963]]. He was President for 16 years until his assassination on 26 October 1979. The [[Democratic Justice Party]] inherited the same ideology as the Democratic-Republican Party. Its head, [[Chun Doo-hwan]], also gained power through a coup and his followers called themselves the Hanahae. The Democratic Justice Party changed its form and acted to suppress the opposition party and to follow the people's demand for direct elections. The party's [[Roh Tae-woo]] became the first President who was elected through direct election. The next form of the major conservative party was the Democratic-Liberal Party and again through election its second leader, [[Kim Young-sam]], became the fourteenth President of Korea. When the conservative party was beaten by the opposition party in the general election, it changed its form again to follow the party members' demand for reforms. It became the New Korean Party, but it changed again one year later since the President Kim Young-sam was blamed by the citizen for the [[International Monetary Fund]].{{clarify|date=March 2014}} It changed its name to Grand National Party (GNP). Since the late [[Kim Dae-jung]] assumed the presidency in 1998, GNP had been the opposition party until [[Lee Myung-bak]] won the presidential election of [[2007 South Korean presidential election|2007]].\n\n==== United States ====\n{{main|Conservatism in the United States}}\n[[File:President Reagan speaking in Minneapolis 1982.jpg|thumb|[[President of the United States]] [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981\u20131989), whose [[Reagan Doctrine]] has reshaped the Republican Party]]\nThe meaning of \"conservatism\" in the United States has little in common with the way the word is used elsewhere.

The early studies focused on conservatives, beginning with [[Theodor W. Adorno]]'s ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) based on the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]] personality test. This book has been heavily criticized on theoretical and methodological grounds, but some of its findings{{clarify|date=July 2019}} have been confirmed by further empirical research.<ref name=\"Jost, J.J 2003\">Jost, J.J, Glaser, J., Kruglanski, A.A., & Sulloway, F.J.

Her early years were in the hands of a German [[nanny]], and the initial intention was that she should be sent to [[Berlin]] to complete her education. The deteriorating political climate between Britain and Germany led to her moving to Britain instead at the age of six. She attended [[Bedales School]] from 1918 to 1924.<ref name=\"orbit\">{{cite news| author=Jack Adrian| title=Obituaries: Elizabeth Ferrars| work=The Independent| date=12 April 1995| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituarieselizabeth-ferrars-1616223.html }}</ref> She claimed<ref>Conversations with her husband's nephew, Tom Brown,1986\u201399</ref> in later years that she never would have been able to write crime novels if she had not learned German as a child from her nanny, the rigorous sentence structure and complex rules of grammar being an indispensable preparation for the architecture of a crime thriller.  Unable to study [[English Literature]], because she was never taught [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]], she took a diploma in journalism at [[London University]] (1925\u20131928),<ref name=\"orbit\"/> and wrote two novels under her own name in the early 1930s. It was at this time that she met and married her first husband.\n\nAround 1940, she met a lecturer in Botany at [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]], Dr (later Professor) [[Robert Brown (plant physiologist)|Robert Brown]],<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Dsx3-Hm7b4C&pg=PA29&dq=Elizabeth+Ferrars&as_brr=3&ei=6GXYStWhLYWcMtny-JsP#v=onepage&q=Elizabeth%20Ferrars&f=false| title=Gothic novels of the twentieth century: an annotated bibliography| author=Elsa J. Radcliffe| publisher=Rowman & Littlefield| year=1979| isbn=978-0-8108-1190-4 }}</ref> and the same year her first crime novel, ''Give a Corpse a Bad Name'', was published. She separated from her first husband and lived with Robert Brown in [[Belsize Park]], London, from 1942. However, she did not obtain a divorce and marry Brown until October 1945. She remained on friendly terms with her first husband, who also remarried. In 1951 she and her new husband moved to [[Cornell University]] in the USA, where her husband had been offered a post. Notwithstanding the financial attraction of such a posting in austerity postwar Britain, they returned a year later owing to the atmosphere of [[McCarthyism]]. Having seen the rise of fascism in Europe, they were disturbed by the \"witch-hunts\" against many writers and academics accused of communist sympathies. In 1953, she became one of the founding members of the [[Crime Writers' Association]] (she was its chair in 1977). She was inducted into the famed [http://gadetection.pbworks.com/w/page/7930445/Detection%20Club%2C%20The Detection Club] in 1958.\n\nFrom 1957, when her husband was appointed Regius Professor of Botany at the [[University of Edinburgh]], until shortly after his retirement in 1977, they lived in [[Edinburgh]]. Citing the long, cold winters as a reason, they then moved south to the village of [[Blewbury]] in Oxfordshire, where they lived until her sudden death in 1995. She professed no religious faith and was probably instrumental in turning her husband from distinct [[evangelism]] in the 1930s towards agnosticism.{{cn|date=January 2020}} She was buried in Blewbury in a non-religious ceremony. Her final novel, ''A Thief in the Night'', was published posthumously in 1995. She was survived by a nephew, Peter MacTaggart. In the United States, her novels were published under the name '''E.X. Ferrars''', her US publishers assuring her that \"the 'X' would 'do it'\". Ferrars was in fact her mother's maiden name.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UjgE_CRiIW4C&pg=PA70&dq=Elizabeth+Ferrars&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=rWbYSqDdN4TWNePP_YIP#v=onepage&q=Elizabeth%20Ferrars&f=false| title=Who's who in crime and mystery writing| author=Rosemary Herbert| publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2003| isbn=978-0-19-515761-1 }}</ref>\n\nThough the majority of Ferrars's works are standalone novels, she wrote several series.<ref>{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=Gina|title=E.

Late in her career, she began writing about a semi-estranged married couple, Virginia and Felix Freer, and a retired [[botanist]], Andrew Basnett. Several of her short stories also feature an elderly detective called Jonas P. Jonas.<ref name=\"orbit\"/>\n\nHer extraordinary output owes a great deal to considerable self-discipline and diligent method.  Her plots were worked out in detail in hand-written notebooks before being filled out in typed manuscript; she said that they were worked backwards from the denouement. Like every writer, she based characters and situations on people she knew and things she had seen in real life.

Her early years were in the hands of a German [[nanny]], and the initial intention was that she should be sent to [[Berlin]] to complete her education.

It was at this time that she met and married her first husband.\n\nAround 1940, she met a lecturer in Botany at [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]], Dr (later Professor) [[Robert Brown (plant physiologist)|Robert Brown]],<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Dsx3-Hm7b4C&pg=PA29&dq=Elizabeth+Ferrars&as_brr=3&ei=6GXYStWhLYWcMtny-JsP#v=onepage&q=Elizabeth%20Ferrars&f=false| title=Gothic novels of the twentieth century: an annotated bibliography| author=Elsa J.

She separated from her first husband and lived with Robert Brown in [[Belsize Park]], London, from 1942. However, she did not obtain a divorce and marry Brown until October 1945. She remained on friendly terms with her first husband, who also remarried. In 1951 she and her new husband moved to [[Cornell University]] in the USA, where her husband had been offered a post. Notwithstanding the financial attraction of such a posting in austerity postwar Britain, they returned a year later owing to the atmosphere of [[McCarthyism]]. Having seen the rise of fascism in Europe, they were disturbed by the \"witch-hunts\" against many writers and academics accused of communist sympathies. In 1953, she became one of the founding members of the [[Crime Writers' Association]] (she was its chair in 1977). She was inducted into the famed [http://gadetection.pbworks.com/w/page/7930445/Detection%20Club%2C%20The Detection Club] in 1958.\n\nFrom 1957, when her husband was appointed Regius Professor of Botany at the [[University of Edinburgh]], until shortly after his retirement in 1977, they lived in [[Edinburgh]]. Citing the long, cold winters as a reason, they then moved south to the village of [[Blewbury]] in Oxfordshire, where they lived until her sudden death in 1995. She professed no religious faith and was probably instrumental in turning her husband from distinct [[evangelism]] in the 1930s towards agnosticism.{{cn|date=January 2020}} She was buried in Blewbury in a non-religious ceremony. Her final novel, ''A Thief in the Night'', was published posthumously in 1995. She was survived by a nephew, Peter MacTaggart. In the United States, her novels were published under the name '''E.X.

One form of electro-galvanic fuel cell based on the oxidation of lead is commonly used to measure the concentration of [[oxygen]] gas in [[underwater diving]] and [[medical]] [[breathing gases]].\n\nElectronically monitored or controlled diving [[rebreather]] systems,<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" /> saturation diving systems,<ref name=\"IMCA D022\" /> and many medical life-support systems use galvanic oxygen sensors in their control circuits to directly monitor oxygen [[partial pressure]] during operation.<ref name=Goble /> They are also used in oxygen analysers in [[Recreational diving|recreational]], [[technical diving]] and surface supplied mixed gas diving to analyse the proportion of oxygen in a [[nitrox]], [[heliox]] or [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] [[breathing gas]] before a dive.<ref name=DANnitrox />\n\nThese cells are lead/oxygen galvanic cells where oxygen molecules are dissociated and reduced to hydroxyl ions at the cathode. The ions diffuse through the electrolyte and oxidize the lead anode. A current proportional to the rate of oxygen consumption is generated when the cathode and anode are electrically connected through a resistor<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\n==Function==\n\nThe cell reaction for a lead/oxygen cell is: 2Pb+O<sub>2</sub>=2PbO, made up of the cathode reaction: O2+2H<sub>2</sub>O+4e-4OH, and anode reaction: 2Pb+4OH-2PbO+2H<sub>2</sub>O + 4e.<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\nThe cell current is proportional to the rate of oxygen reduction at the cathode, but this is not linearly dependent on the partial pressure of oxygen in the gas to which the cell is exposed: Linearity is achieved by placing a diffusion barrier between the gas and the cathode, which limits the amount of gas reaching the cathode to an amount that can be fully reduced without significant delay, making the partial pressure in the immediate vicinity of the electrode close to zero. As a result of this the amount of oxygen reaching the electrode follows [[Fick's laws of diffusion]] and is proportional to the partial pressure in the gas beyond the membrane. This makes the current proportional to P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>. \nThe load resistor over the cell allows the electronics to measure a voltage rather than a current. This voltage depends on the construction and age of the sensor, and typically varies between 7 and 28&nbsp;mV for a P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> of 0.21 bar<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\nDiffusion is linearly dependent on the partial pressure gradient, but is also temperature dependent, and the current rises about two to three percent per kelvin rise in temperature. A negative temperature coefficient resistor is used to compensate, and for this to be effective it must be at the same temperature as the cell. Oxygen cells which may be exposed to relatively large or rapid temperature changes, like rebreathers, generally use thermally conductive paste between the temperature compensating circuit and the cell to speed up the balancing of temperature.<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\nTemperature also affects the signal response time, which is generally between 6 and 15 seconds at room temperature for a 90% response to a step change in partial pressure. Cold cells react much slower and hot cells much faster. As the anode material is oxidised the output current drops and eventually will cease altogether. The oxidation rate depends on the oxygen reaching the anode from the sensor membrane. Lifetime is measured in oxygen-hours, and also depends on temperature and humidity<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\n==Applications==\n===Gas mixture analysis===\n{{see also|Gas blending for scuba diving#Gas analysis}}\nThe oxygen content of a stored gas mixture can be analysed by passing a small flow of the gas over a recently calibrated cell for long enough that the output stabilises. The stable output represents the fraction of oxygen in the mixture. Care must be taken to ensure that the gas flow is not diluted by ambient air, as this would affect the reading.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}<!--get ref from instruction manual-->\n\n===Breathing gas composition monitoring===\nThe partial pressure of oxygen in anaesthetic gases is monitored by siting the cell in the gas flow, which is at local atmospheric pressure, and can be calibrated to directly indicate the fraction of oxygen in the mix.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe partial pressure of oxygen in [[diving chamber]]s and [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied breathing gas mixtures]] can also be monitored using these cells. This can either be done by placing the cell directly in the hyperbaric environment, wired through the hull to the monitor, or indirectly, by bleeding off gas from the hyperbaric environment or diver gas supply and analysing at atmospheric pressure, then calculating the partial pressure in the hyperbaric environment. This is frequently required in [[saturation diving]] and surface oriented surface supplied mixed gas commercial diving.<ref name=\"IMCA D030\" /><ref name=\"IMCA D022\" />\n\n===Diving rebreather control systems===\nThe breathing gas mixture in a diving rebreather loop is usually measured using oxygen cells, and the output of the cells is used by either the diver or an electronic control system to control addition of oxygen to increase partial pressure when it is below the chosen lower set-point, or to flush with diluent gas when it is above the upper set-point. When the partial pressure is between the upper and lower set-points, it is suitable for breathing at that depth and is left until it changes as a result of consumption by the diver, or a change in ambient pressure as a result of a depth change.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAccuracy and reliability of measurement is important in this application for two basic reasons. Firstly, if the oxygen content is too low, the diver will lose consciousness due to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and probably die,<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" /> or if the oxygen content is too high, the risk of central nervous system [[oxygen toxicity]] causing convulsions and loss of consciousness, with a high risk of drowning becomes unacceptable.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" /> Secondly, [[Decompression (diving)|decompression]] obligations cannot be accurately or reliably calculated if the breathing gas composition is not known.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" /> Pre-dive calibration of the cells can only check response to partial pressures up to 100% at atmospheric pressure, or 1 bar. As the set points are commonly in the range of 1.2 to 1.6 bar,<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" /> special hyperbaric calibration equipment would be required to reliably test the response at the set-points. This equipment is available, but is expensive and not in common use, and requires the cells to be removed from the rebreather and installed in the test unit. To compensate for the possibility of a cell failure during a dive, three cells are generally fitted, on the principle that failure of one cell at a time is most likely, and that if two cells indicate the same P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>, they are more likely to be correct than the single cell with a different reading. Voting logic allows the control system to control the circuit for the rest of the dive according to the two cells assumed to be correct. This is not entirely reliable, as it is possible for two cells to fail on the same dive.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" />\n\nThe sensors should be placed in the rebreather where a temperature gradient between the gas and the electronics in the back of the cells will not occur.<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\n==Lifespan==\nOxygen cells behave in a similar way to electrical batteries in that they have a finite lifespan which is dependent upon use. The [[chemical reaction]] described above causes the cell to create an electrical output that has a predicted voltage which is dependent on the materials used. In theory they should give that voltage from the day they are made until they are exhausted, except that one component of the planned chemical reaction has been left out of the assembly: oxygen.\n\nOxygen is one of the fuels of the cell so the more oxygen there is at the reaction surface, the more electrical current is generated.

High ambient temperatures will increase sensor current, and reduce cell life.

If one assumes that only one cell will fail, then comparing three or more outputs which have been calibrated at two points is likely to pick up the cell which has failed by assuming that any two cells that produce the same output are correct and the one which produces a different output is defective. This assumption is usually correct in practice, particularly if there is some difference in the history of the cells involved.<ref>Cells from the same batch with the same history are more likely to fail together in the same way than cells with a different history</ref> The concept of comparing the output from three cells at the same place in the loop and controlling the gas mixture based on the average output of the two with the most similar output at any given time is known as voting logic, and is more reliable than control based on a single cell. If the third cell output deviates sufficiently from the other two, an alarm indicates probable cell failure. If this occurs before the dive, the rebreather is deemed unsafe and should not be used. If it occurs during a dive, it indicates an unreliable control system, and the dive should be aborted. Continuing a dive using a rebreather with a failed cell alarm significantly increases the risk of a fatal loop control failure. This system is not totally reliable. There has been at least one case reported where two cells failed similarly and the control system voted out the remaining good cell.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" />\n\nIf the probability of failure of each cell was statistically independent of the others, and each cell alone was sufficient to allow safe function of the rebreather, the use of three fully redundant cells in parallel would reduce risk of failure by five or six orders of magnitude.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" />\n\nThe voting logic changes this considerably. A majority of cells must not fail for safe function of the unit. In order to decide whether a cell is functioning correctly, it must be compared with an expected output. This is done by comparing it against the outputs of other cells. In the case of two cells, if the outputs differ, then one at least must be wrong, but it is not known which one. In such a case the diver should assume the unit is unsafe and bail out to open circuit. With three cells, if they all differ within an accepted tolerance, they may all be deemed functional. If two differ within tolerance, and the third does not, the two within tolerance may be deemed functional, and the third faulty. If none are within tolerance of each other, they may all be faulty, and if one is not, there is no way of identifying it.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" />\n\nUsing this logic, the improvement in reliability gained by use of voting logic where at least two sensors must function for the system to function is greatly reduced compared to the fully redundant version. Improvements are only in the order of one to two orders of magnitude. This would be great improvement over the single sensor, but the analysis above has assumed statistical independence of the failure of the sensors, which is generally not realistic.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" />\n\nFactors which make the cell outputs in a rebreather statistically dependent include:<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" />\n*Common calibration gas - They are all calibrated together in the pre-dive check using the same diluent and oxygen supply.\n*Sensors are often from the same manufacturing batch - Components, materials and processes are likely to be very similar.\n*Sensors are often installed together and have since been exposed to the same P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>, temperature profile over the subsequent time.\n*Common working environment, particularly with regards to temperature and relative humidity, as they are usually mounted in very close proximity in the loop, to ensure that they measure similar gas.\n*Common measurement systems\n*Common firmware for processing the signals\n\nThis statistical dependency can be minimised and mitigated by:<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" />\n*Using sensors from different manufacturers or batches, so that no two are from the same batch  \n*Changing sensors at different times, so they each have a different history\n*Ensuring that the calibration gases are correct\n*Adding an statistically independent P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> measuring system to the loop at a different place, using a different model sensor, and using different electronics and software to process the signal.\n*Calibrating this sensor using a different gas source to the others\n\nAn alternative method of providing redundancy in the control system is to recalibrate the sensors periodically during the dive by exposing them to a flow of either diluent or oxygen or both at different times, and using the output to check whether the cell is reacting appropriately to the known gas as the known depth. This method has the added advantage of allowing calibration at higher oxygen partial pressure than 1 bar.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" /> This procedure may be done automatically, where the system has been designed to do it, or the diver can manually perform a ''diluent flush'' at any depth at which the diluent is breathable to compare the cell P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> readings against a known F<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and absolute pressure to verify the displayed values. This test does not only validate the cell. If the sensor does not display the expected value, it is possible that the oxygen sensor, the pressure sensor (depth), or the gas mixture F<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>, or any combination of these may be faulty. As all three of these possible faults could be life-threatening, the test is quite powerful.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" />\n\n==Testing==\n[[Image:Cell checker.jpg|thumb|right|A galvanic oxygen cell checker]]\n\nThe first certified cell checking device that was commercially available was launched in 2005 by Narked at 90,[https://www.narkedat90.com/cell-checkerc.html Cell checker] but did not achieve commercial success.

One form of electro-galvanic fuel cell based on the oxidation of lead is commonly used to measure the concentration of [[oxygen]] gas in [[underwater diving]] and [[medical]] [[breathing gases]].\n\nElectronically monitored or controlled diving [[rebreather]] systems,<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" /> saturation diving systems,<ref name=\"IMCA D022\" /> and many medical life-support systems use galvanic oxygen sensors in their control circuits to directly monitor oxygen [[partial pressure]] during operation.<ref name=Goble /> They are also used in oxygen analysers in [[Recreational diving|recreational]], [[technical diving]] and surface supplied mixed gas diving to analyse the proportion of oxygen in a [[nitrox]], [[heliox]] or [[Trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] [[breathing gas]] before a dive.<ref name=DANnitrox />\n\nThese cells are lead/oxygen galvanic cells where oxygen molecules are dissociated and reduced to hydroxyl ions at the cathode. The ions diffuse through the electrolyte and oxidize the lead anode. A current proportional to the rate of oxygen consumption is generated when the cathode and anode are electrically connected through a resistor<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\n==Function==\n\nThe cell reaction for a lead/oxygen cell is: 2Pb+O<sub>2</sub>=2PbO, made up of the cathode reaction: O2+2H<sub>2</sub>O+4e-4OH, and anode reaction: 2Pb+4OH-2PbO+2H<sub>2</sub>O + 4e.<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\nThe cell current is proportional to the rate of oxygen reduction at the cathode, but this is not linearly dependent on the partial pressure of oxygen in the gas to which the cell is exposed: Linearity is achieved by placing a diffusion barrier between the gas and the cathode, which limits the amount of gas reaching the cathode to an amount that can be fully reduced without significant delay, making the partial pressure in the immediate vicinity of the electrode close to zero. As a result of this the amount of oxygen reaching the electrode follows [[Fick's laws of diffusion]] and is proportional to the partial pressure in the gas beyond the membrane. This makes the current proportional to P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>. \nThe load resistor over the cell allows the electronics to measure a voltage rather than a current. This voltage depends on the construction and age of the sensor, and typically varies between 7 and 28&nbsp;mV for a P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> of 0.21 bar<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\nDiffusion is linearly dependent on the partial pressure gradient, but is also temperature dependent, and the current rises about two to three percent per kelvin rise in temperature. A negative temperature coefficient resistor is used to compensate, and for this to be effective it must be at the same temperature as the cell. Oxygen cells which may be exposed to relatively large or rapid temperature changes, like rebreathers, generally use thermally conductive paste between the temperature compensating circuit and the cell to speed up the balancing of temperature.<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\nTemperature also affects the signal response time, which is generally between 6 and 15 seconds at room temperature for a 90% response to a step change in partial pressure. Cold cells react much slower and hot cells much faster. As the anode material is oxidised the output current drops and eventually will cease altogether. The oxidation rate depends on the oxygen reaching the anode from the sensor membrane. Lifetime is measured in oxygen-hours, and also depends on temperature and humidity<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\n==Applications==\n===Gas mixture analysis===\n{{see also|Gas blending for scuba diving#Gas analysis}}\nThe oxygen content of a stored gas mixture can be analysed by passing a small flow of the gas over a recently calibrated cell for long enough that the output stabilises. The stable output represents the fraction of oxygen in the mixture. Care must be taken to ensure that the gas flow is not diluted by ambient air, as this would affect the reading.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}<!--get ref from instruction manual-->\n\n===Breathing gas composition monitoring===\nThe partial pressure of oxygen in anaesthetic gases is monitored by siting the cell in the gas flow, which is at local atmospheric pressure, and can be calibrated to directly indicate the fraction of oxygen in the mix.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe partial pressure of oxygen in [[diving chamber]]s and [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied breathing gas mixtures]] can also be monitored using these cells. This can either be done by placing the cell directly in the hyperbaric environment, wired through the hull to the monitor, or indirectly, by bleeding off gas from the hyperbaric environment or diver gas supply and analysing at atmospheric pressure, then calculating the partial pressure in the hyperbaric environment. This is frequently required in [[saturation diving]] and surface oriented surface supplied mixed gas commercial diving.<ref name=\"IMCA D030\" /><ref name=\"IMCA D022\" />\n\n===Diving rebreather control systems===\nThe breathing gas mixture in a diving rebreather loop is usually measured using oxygen cells, and the output of the cells is used by either the diver or an electronic control system to control addition of oxygen to increase partial pressure when it is below the chosen lower set-point, or to flush with diluent gas when it is above the upper set-point. When the partial pressure is between the upper and lower set-points, it is suitable for breathing at that depth and is left until it changes as a result of consumption by the diver, or a change in ambient pressure as a result of a depth change.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAccuracy and reliability of measurement is important in this application for two basic reasons. Firstly, if the oxygen content is too low, the diver will lose consciousness due to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and probably die,<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" /> or if the oxygen content is too high, the risk of central nervous system [[oxygen toxicity]] causing convulsions and loss of consciousness, with a high risk of drowning becomes unacceptable.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" /> Secondly, [[Decompression (diving)|decompression]] obligations cannot be accurately or reliably calculated if the breathing gas composition is not known.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" /> Pre-dive calibration of the cells can only check response to partial pressures up to 100% at atmospheric pressure, or 1 bar. As the set points are commonly in the range of 1.2 to 1.6 bar,<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" /> special hyperbaric calibration equipment would be required to reliably test the response at the set-points. This equipment is available, but is expensive and not in common use, and requires the cells to be removed from the rebreather and installed in the test unit. To compensate for the possibility of a cell failure during a dive, three cells are generally fitted, on the principle that failure of one cell at a time is most likely, and that if two cells indicate the same P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>, they are more likely to be correct than the single cell with a different reading. Voting logic allows the control system to control the circuit for the rest of the dive according to the two cells assumed to be correct. This is not entirely reliable, as it is possible for two cells to fail on the same dive.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" />\n\nThe sensors should be placed in the rebreather where a temperature gradient between the gas and the electronics in the back of the cells will not occur.<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\n==Lifespan==\nOxygen cells behave in a similar way to electrical batteries in that they have a finite lifespan which is dependent upon use. The [[chemical reaction]] described above causes the cell to create an electrical output that has a predicted voltage which is dependent on the materials used. In theory they should give that voltage from the day they are made until they are exhausted, except that one component of the planned chemical reaction has been left out of the assembly: oxygen.\n\nOxygen is one of the fuels of the cell so the more oxygen there is at the reaction surface, the more electrical current is generated. The chemistry sets the [[voltage]] and the oxygen concentration controls the [[electric current]] output. If an [[electric circuit|electrical load]] is connected across the cell it can draw up to this current but if the cell is overloaded the voltage will drop. When the lead electrode has been substantially oxidised, the maximum current that the cell can produce will drop, and eventually linearity of output voltage to partial pressure of oxygen at the reactive surface will fail within the required range of measurement, and the cell will no longer be accurate.\n\nThere are two commonly used ways to specify expected sensor life span: The time in months at room temperature in air, or volume percentage oxygen hours (Vol%O<sub>2</sub>h). Storage at low oxygen partial pressure when not in use would seem an effective way to extend cell life, but when stored in anoxic conditions the sensor current will cease and the surface of the electrode may be passivated, which can lead to sensor failure. High ambient temperatures will increase sensor current, and reduce cell life. In diving service a cell typically lasts for 12 to 18 months, with perhaps 150 hours service in the diving loop at an oxygen partial pressure of about 1.2 bar and the rest of the time in storage in air at room temperature.<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\nFailures in cells can be life-threatening for technical divers and in particular, [[rebreather]] divers.<ref name=AAUS-2007 /> The failure modes common to these cells are: failing with a higher than expected output due to [[electrolyte]] leaks, which is usually attributable to physical damage, contamination, or other defects in manufacture,{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} or current limitation due to exhausted cell life and non linear output across its range.<ref name=\"Sieber 2012\" />\n\nShelf life can be maximised by keeping the cell in the sealed bag as supplied by the manufacturer until being put into service, storing the cell before and between use at or below room temperature, - a range of from 10 to 22&nbsp;\u00b0C is recommended by a manufacturer - and avoid storing the cell in warm or dry environments for prolonged periods, particularly areas exposed to direct sunlight.<ref name=\"Teledyne\" />\n\n===Failure modes===\nWhen new, a sensor can produce a linear output for over 4 bar partial pressure of oxygen, and as the anode is consumed the linear output range drops, eventually to below the range of partial pressures which may be expected in service, at which stage it is no longer fit to control the system.

This would be great improvement over the single sensor, but the analysis above has assumed statistical independence of the failure of the sensors, which is generally not realistic.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" />\n\nFactors which make the cell outputs in a rebreather statistically dependent include:<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" />\n*Common calibration gas - They are all calibrated together in the pre-dive check using the same diluent and oxygen supply.\n*Sensors are often from the same manufacturing batch - Components, materials and processes are likely to be very similar.\n*Sensors are often installed together and have since been exposed to the same P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>, temperature profile over the subsequent time.\n*Common working environment, particularly with regards to temperature and relative humidity, as they are usually mounted in very close proximity in the loop, to ensure that they measure similar gas.\n*Common measurement systems\n*Common firmware for processing the signals\n\nThis statistical dependency can be minimised and mitigated by:<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" />\n*Using sensors from different manufacturers or batches, so that no two are from the same batch  \n*Changing sensors at different times, so they each have a different history\n*Ensuring that the calibration gases are correct\n*Adding an statistically independent P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> measuring system to the loop at a different place, using a different model sensor, and using different electronics and software to process the signal.\n*Calibrating this sensor using a different gas source to the others\n\nAn alternative method of providing redundancy in the control system is to recalibrate the sensors periodically during the dive by exposing them to a flow of either diluent or oxygen or both at different times, and using the output to check whether the cell is reacting appropriately to the known gas as the known depth. This method has the added advantage of allowing calibration at higher oxygen partial pressure than 1 bar.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" /> This procedure may be done automatically, where the system has been designed to do it, or the diver can manually perform a ''diluent flush'' at any depth at which the diluent is breathable to compare the cell P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> readings against a known F<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> and absolute pressure to verify the displayed values. This test does not only validate the cell. If the sensor does not display the expected value, it is possible that the oxygen sensor, the pressure sensor(depth), or the gas mixture F<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>, or any combination of these may be faulty. As all three of these possible faults could be life-threatening, the test is quite powerful.<ref name=\"Jones 2012\" />\n\n==Testing==\n[[Image:Cell checker.jpg|thumb|right|A galvanic oxygen cell checker]]\n\nThe first certified cell checking device that was commercially available was launched in 2005 by Narked at 90,[https://www.narkedat90.com/cell-checkerc.html Cell checker] but did not achieve commercial success.
