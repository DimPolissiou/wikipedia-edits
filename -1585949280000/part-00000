It has adopted a number of resolutions and recommendations calling for legally-binding standards on preventing, protecting against and prosecuting the most severe and widespread forms of gender-based violence.\n\nNational reports, studies and surveys revealed the magnitude of the problem in Europe.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The campaign in particular showed a large variation in Europe of national responses to violence against women and domestic violence. Thus the need for harmonised legal standards to ensure that victims benefit from the same level of protection everywhere in Europe became apparent. The Ministers of Justice of Council of Europe member states began discussing the need to step up protection from domestic violence, in particular intimate partner violence.\n\nThe Council of Europe decided it was necessary to set comprehensive standards to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence. In December 2008, the Committee of Ministers set up an expert group mandated to prepare a draft convention in this field. Over the course of just over two years, this group, called the CAHVIO (Ad Hoc Committee for preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/violence/default_en.asp |title=Ad Hoc Committee on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CAHVIO) |publisher=Council of Europe |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> worked out a draft text.

In its decision, the Court identified a relation between previous Council of Europe documents against domestic violence and the expansion of [[transgender rights]]. According to the Constitutional Court, the convention offers a binary interpretation of [[gender]] as both a biological and social category, which contradicts the [[constitution of Bulgaria]], where humans are irrevocably defined as biologically male or female, with equal standing as citizens. The convention therefore lays formal ground to promote non-biological definitions of [[gender]], which are deemed unconstitutional.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.24chasa.bg/mnenia/article/6983990|title=The complete decision of the Constitutional Court on the Istanbul convention|publisher=24 Chasa|date=27 July 2018|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Slovak opposition to ratification ===\nRoman Catholic, nationalist and far-right groups and parties in Slovakia have been opposed to the country ratifying the Convention, especially because of its clauses concerning LGBT rights, which they portrayed as \"extreme liberalism\" that corrodes \"traditional values\" they felt needed to be protected.<ref name=\"Shotter\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/c8a2787a-5322-11e9-a3db-1fe89bedc16e |title=Anti-corruption lawyer elected Slovakia\u2019s first female president |author=James Shotter |work=Financial Times |date=31 March 2019 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Sirotnikova\">{{Cite news |url=https://balkaninsight.com/2019/12/11/slovak-right-accused-of-forcing-abortion-as-election-issue/ |title=Slovak Right Accused of Forcing Abortion as Election Issue |author=Miroslava German Sirotnikova |work=Balkan Insight |date=11 December 2019 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> On 29 March 2019, one day before the [[2019 Slovak presidential election]], nationalist politicians forced through a parliamentary resolution asking Slovakia\u2019s government not to ratify the Istanbul Convention, in an effort to mobilise conservative voters to vote for [[Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d]] instead of the progressive candidate [[Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1]], who had been supporting LGBT rights and women's right to abortion.<ref name=\"Shotter\"/> Although \u010caputov\u00e1 won the election and became Slovakia's first female president, conservative groups stepped up their campaign to prevent Slovakia from ratifying the Convention and restricting access to abortion in the following months.<ref name=\"Sirotnikova\"/> On 25 February 2020, the Parliament of [[Slovakia]], the [[National Council (Slovakia)|National Council]], rejected the Convention at an extraordinary session by a vote of 17\u201396 (37 absent).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrsr.sk/web/Default.aspx?sid=schodze/hlasovanie/hlasklub&ID=43645|title=National Council of the Slovak Republic - votes by members of parliament|date=25 February 2020|website=Parliament of Slovakia|url-status=live |accessdate=17 March 2020 |language=sk}}</ref> Following the decision of Parliament, President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 sent a letter to the Council of Europe on 6 March 2020, informing it that the Slovak Republic could not become a party to the Istanbul Convention.

It has adopted a number of resolutions and recommendations calling for legally-binding standards on preventing, protecting against and prosecuting the most severe and widespread forms of gender-based violence.\n\nNational reports, studies and surveys revealed the magnitude of the problem in Europe.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The campaign in particular showed a large variation in Europe of national responses to violence against women and domestic violence. Thus the need for harmonised legal standards to ensure that victims benefit from the same level of protection everywhere in Europe became apparent. The Ministers of Justice of Council of Europe member states began discussing the need to step up protection from domestic violence, in particular intimate partner violence.\n\nThe Council of Europe decided it was necessary to set comprehensive standards to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence. In December 2008, the Committee of Ministers set up an expert group mandated to prepare a draft convention in this field. Over the course of just over two years, this group, called the CAHVIO (Ad Hoc Committee for preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/violence/default_en.asp |title=Ad Hoc Committee on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CAHVIO) |publisher=Council of Europe |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> worked out a draft text.

The convention therefore lays formal ground to promote non-biological definitions of [[gender]], which are deemed unconstitutional.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.24chasa.bg/mnenia/article/6983990|title=The complete decision of the Constitutional Court on the Istanbul convention|publisher=24 Chasa|date=27 July 2018|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Slovak opposition to ratification ===\nRoman Catholic, nationalist and far-right groups and parties in Slovakia have been opposed to the country ratifying the Convention, especially because of its clauses concerning LGBT rights, which they portrayed as \"extreme liberalism\" that corrodes \"traditional values\" they felt needed to be protected.<ref name=\"Shotter\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/c8a2787a-5322-11e9-a3db-1fe89bedc16e |title=Anti-corruption lawyer elected Slovakia\u2019s first female president |author=James Shotter |work=Financial Times |date=31 March 2019 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Sirotnikova\">{{Cite news |url=https://balkaninsight.com/2019/12/11/slovak-right-accused-of-forcing-abortion-as-election-issue/ |title=Slovak Right Accused of Forcing Abortion as Election Issue |author=Miroslava German Sirotnikova |work=Balkan Insight |date=11 December 2019 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> On 29 March 2019, one day before the [[2019 Slovak presidential election]], nationalist politicians forced through a parliamentary resolution asking Slovakia\u2019s government not to ratify the Istanbul Convention, in an effort to mobilise conservative voters to vote for [[Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d]] instead of the progressive candidate [[Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1]], who had been supporting LGBT rights and women's right to abortion.<ref name=\"Shotter\"/> Although \u010caputov\u00e1 won the election and became Slovakia's first female president, conservative groups stepped up their campaign to prevent Slovakia from ratifying the Convention and restricting access to abortion in the following months.<ref name=\"Sirotnikova\"/> On 25 February 2020, the Parliament of [[Slovakia]], the [[National Council (Slovakia)|National Council]], rejected the Convention at an extraordinary session by a vote of 17\u201396 (37 absent).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrsr.sk/web/Default.aspx?sid=schodze/hlasovanie/hlasklub&ID=43645|title=National Council of the Slovak Republic - votes by members of parliament|date=25 February 2020|website=Parliament of Slovakia|url-status=live |accessdate=17 March 2020 |language=sk}}</ref> Following the decision of Parliament, President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 sent a letter to the Council of Europe on 6 March 2020, informing it that the Slovak Republic could not become a party to the Istanbul Convention.

The Convention also contains a definition of [[gender]]: for the purpose of the Convention gender is defined in Article 3(c) as \"the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for women and men\". Moreover, the treaty establishes a series of offences characterized as violence against women. States which ratify the Convention must criminalize several offences, including: psychological violence (Art.33); stalking (Art.34); physical violence (Art.35); [[sexual violence]], including [[rape]], explicitly covering all engagement in [[non-consensual sex|non-consensual acts of a sexual nature]] with a person (Art.36), [[forced marriage]] (Art.37); [[female genital mutilation]] (Art.38), [[forced abortion]] and [[forced sterilisation]] (Art.39). The Convention states that [[sexual harassment]] must be subject to \"criminal or other legal sanction\" (Art. 40). The Convention also includes an article targeting crimes committed in the name of so-called \"[[honour killing|honour]]\" (Art. 42).<ref name=\"Full_list\" />\n\n=== Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO) ===\nThe convention mandates an independent expert body, the Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO), with monitoring the implementation of the convention.

In Article 2, this Convention indicates that the provisions shall apply in time of peace and also in situations of [[armed conflicts]] in violence against women and domestic violence. Article 3 provides defines key terms: \n*\"[[violence against women]]\" is \"violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women and shall mean all acts of gender-based violation that result in, or are likely to result in physical, sexual, psychological, or economic harm or suffering to women including [[threat]]s of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life\", \n*\"[[domestic violence]]\": \"all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence that occur with the family or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or partners, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim.\"\n*\"[[gender]]\": means \"the [[gender role|socially constructed roles]], behaviours, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for women and men.\"\n*\"[[gender-based violence]] against women\": means \"violence that is directed against a woman because she is a woman or that affects women disproportionately.\"\n\nArticle 4 prohibits several types of discrimination stating: The implementation of the provisions of this Convention by the Parties, in particular measure to protect the rights of victims, shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, [[gender]], [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], colour, language political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a [[national minority]], property, birth, [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], age, state of health, [[disability]], [[marital status]], migrant or [[refugee]] status, or other status.\n\n==Accusations of public manipulation against the Convention==\n[[File:Anne Brasseur It is not about countries, it is about protecting citizens!.webm|thumb|start=245|[[Anne Brasseur]] countering criticism against the Convention (2019)]]\nSupporters of the Convention have accused its (often [[socially conservative]]) opponents of misrepresenting the scope of the Convention in order to manipulate [[public opinion]] against the Convention. In a press release in November 2018, the Council of Europe stated that \"Despite its clearly stated aims, several religious and ultra conservative groups have been spreading false narratives about the Istanbul Convention\". The release stated that the convention does not seek to impose a certain lifestyle or interfere with personal organization of private life; instead it only seeks to prevent violence against women and domestic violence. The release states that \"the convention is certainly ''not'' about ending sexual differences between women and men. Nowhere does the convention ever imply that women and men are or should be \u201cthe same\u201d\" and that \"the convention does not seek to regulate family life and/or family structures: it neither contains a definition of \u201cfamily\u201d nor does it promote a particular type of family setting.\"<ref>{{cite press release |title=Ending misconceptions about the Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence |publisher=Council of Europe |date=22 November 2018 |url=https://search.coe.int/directorate_of_communications/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectId=09000016808f0fb1 |accessdate=February 21, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW)\n*[[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] (DEVAW)\n* [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action|Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (VDPA)]]\n*[[Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1 Convention|Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women (Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1 Convention)]]\n*[[Maputo Protocol|Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (Maputo Protocol)]]\n*[[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|Expert Group Meeting (EGM): prevention of violence against women and girls]]\n*[[International human rights law]]\n*[[International framework of sexual violence]]\n*[[List of Council of Europe treaties]]\n*[[Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (Ratification of Convention) Act 2017]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/default_en.asp Official Convention website]\n*[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm Convention text]\n*[http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&CM=&DF=&CL=ENG Signatures and Ratifications]\n{{International human rights instruments}}\n[[Category:Council of Europe treaties]]\n[[Category:Violence against women in Europe]]\n[[Category:Women's rights instruments]]\n[[Category:Treaties entered into force in 2014]]\n[[Category:Treaties concluded in 2011]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Albania]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Andorra]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Austria]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Belgium]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Finland]]\n[[Category:Treaties of France]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Italy]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Malta]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Monaco]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Montenegro]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Poland]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Portugal]]\n[[Category:Treaties of North Macedonia]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Romania]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Slovenia]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Spain]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Sweden]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Turkey]]\n[[Category:2011 in Turkey]]\n[[Category:2011 in women's history]]\n", "name_user": "Nederlandse Leeuw", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAdoption, signature and ratification", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_preventing_and_combating_violence_against_women_and_domestic_violence"}

When they realize their ideas collide, they use the money to try to reunite the entire family for Christmas by paying for airline tickets for their children, grandchildren and their in-laws.\n\nHowever, all of the Brady kids are facing personal obstacles that might keep them from enjoying the festivities: Greg's wife Nora is spending Christmas with her family; Peter is romantically involved with his boss Valerie and his inferior position and salary is affecting his self-confidence; Bobby has dropped out of college to become a race car driver but has not revealed this to his parents; Marcia's husband Wally was fired from his job at a toy company; Jan is separating from her husband Philip and Cindy is fighting for her independence since she is the youngest and still gets treated like the baby of the family. Cindy is currently a college undergraduate and in an issue similar to Bobby's, Cindy lies to her parents about overwhelming college student issues, when in actuality she plans to go skiing in [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] with her roommates.\n\nEven their former housekeeper Alice is dealing with a serious issue: her husband Sam has recently left her for another woman. Through each child deciding to spend the holiday and eventually opening up about their issues, Mike and Carol are able to help them out. Jan got back together Phillip, Bobby told his family that NASCAR racing circuit and Wally got a new job in a toy company who is a friend of Mike's.  Mike knew that Wally was fired and helped them out. Nora arrives to surprise Greg. However, the family's Christmas dinner is disrupted when Mike learns that a ruthless businessman he designed a building for has cut corners, resulting in the building collapsing and trapping two security guards inside. Mike manages to free the trapped employees, but an [[aftershock]] results in Mike getting trapped in rubble himself.\n\nIn the end, Mike gets out of the debris after Carol and the entire family sings \"[[O Come, All Ye Faithful]]\" (a nod to Carol singing it in the original series' episode \"The Voice of Christmas\"). After returning home, the family's dinner is again interrupted, this time by a man at the door dressed as [[Santa Claus]]. The kids ask where his bag of presents is, but he tells them that he only has one present, for Alice; it turns out to be Sam, in disguise, who has seen the error of his ways and pleads for Alice's forgiveness. After she takes Sam back, the family invites him to stay for dinner, and the film ends with everyone singing a chorus of \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Robert Reed]] as [[List of The Brady Bunch characters#Mike Brady|Mike Brady]]\n*[[Florence Henderson]] as [[List of The Brady Bunch characters#Carol Brady|Carol Brady]]\n*[[Ann B.

When they realize their ideas collide, they use the money to try to reunite the entire family for Christmas by paying for airline tickets for their children, grandchildren and their in-laws.\n\nHowever, all of the Brady kids are facing personal obstacles that might keep them from enjoying the festivities: Greg's wife Nora is spending Christmas with her family; Peter is romantically involved with his boss Valerie and his inferior position and salary is affecting his self-confidence; Bobby has dropped out of college to become a race car driver but has not revealed this to his parents; Marcia's husband Wally was fired from his job at a toy company; Jan is separating from her husband Philip and Cindy is fighting for her independence since she is the youngest and still gets treated like the baby of the family. Cindy is currently a college undergraduate and in an issue similar to Bobby's, Cindy lies to her parents about overwhelming college student issues, when in actuality she plans to go skiing in [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] with her roommates.\n\nEven their former housekeeper Alice is dealing with a serious issue: her husband Sam has recently left her for another woman. Through each child deciding to spend the holiday and eventually opening up about their issues, Mike and Carol are able to help them out. Jan got back together Phillip, Bobby told his family that NASCAR racing circuit and Wally got a new job in a toy company who is a friend of Mike's.  Mike knew that Wally was fired and helped them out. Nora arrives to surprise Greg. However, the family's Christmas dinner is disrupted when Mike learns that a ruthless businessman he designed a building for has cut corners, resulting in the building collapsing and trapping two security guards inside. Mike manages to free the trapped employees, but an [[aftershock]] results in Mike getting trapped in rubble himself.\n\nIn the end, Mike gets out of the debris after Carol and the entire family sings \"[[O Come, All Ye Faithful]]\" (a nod to Carol singing it in the original series' episode \"The Voice of Christmas\"). After returning home, the family's dinner is again interrupted, this time by a man at the door dressed as [[Santa Claus]]. The kids ask where his bag of presents is, but he tells them that he only has one present, for Alice; it turns out to be Sam, in disguise, who has seen the error of his ways and pleads for Alice's forgiveness. After she takes Sam back, the family invites him to stay for dinner, and the film ends with everyone singing a chorus of \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Robert Reed]] as [[List of The Brady Bunch characters#Mike Brady|Mike Brady]]\n*[[Florence Henderson]] as [[List of The Brady Bunch characters#Carol Brady|Carol Brady]]\n*[[Ann B.

In most cases, the sire is a zebra [[stallion]]. Offspring of a donkey sire and zebra dam called a '''donkra''' or '''zebra hinny''' and offspring of a horse sire and a zebra dam called a '''hebra''' do exist, but are rare and are usually sterile and infertile. Zebroids have been bred since the 19th century. [[Charles Darwin]] noted several zebra hybrids in his works.\n\n==Types==\nZebroid is the term generally used for all zebra hybrids. The different hybrids are generally named using a [[portmanteau]] of the [[wikt:sire#Noun|sire]]'s name and the [[wikt:dam#Noun 2|dam]]'s name. Generally, no distinction is made as to which zebra species is used. Many times, when zebras are crossbred, they develop some form of [[dwarfism]]. Breeding of different branches of the equine family, which does not occur in the wild, generally results in infertile offspring. The combination of sire and dam also affects the offspring [[phenotype]].\n\nA zorse is the offspring of a [[zebra]] stallion and a horse [[mare]]. This cross is also called a zebrula, zebrule, or zebra mule. The rarer reverse pairing is sometimes called a hebra, horbra, zebrinny, zebret, or zebra hinny. Like most other animal hybrids, the zorse is sterile.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.equinepost.com/resources/breeds/showBreed.asp?ID=150|title= Zorse Breed Description |work= Breeding References|publisher= EquinePost |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710195153/http://www.equinepost.com/resources/breeds/showBreed.asp?ID=150 |archivedate=2011-07-10}}</ref>\n\nA zony is the offspring of a zebra stallion and a pony mare.

Like [[mule]]s and [[hinny]]s, however, they are generally genetically unable to breed, due to an odd number of chromosomes disrupting [[meiosis]].\n\n==Genetics==\nDonkeys and wild equids have different numbers of [[chromosome]]s. A donkey has 62 chromosomes; the zebra has between 32 and 46 (depending on the species). In spite of this difference, viable hybrids are possible, provided the gene combination in the hybrid allows for embryonic development to birth. A hybrid has a number of chromosomes somewhere in between. The chromosome difference makes female hybrids poorly fertile and male hybrids generally sterile, due to a phenomenon called [[Haldane's rule]]. The difference in chromosome number is most likely due to horses having two longer chromosomes that contain similar gene content to four zebra chromosomes.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Chromosome Studies of a Donkey-Grevy Zebra Hybrid | journal = Chromosoma | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | year = 1964 | author = K.

And just as female mules and hinnies only very rarely produce offspring the same appears to be true of zebroids. Considering zebroids are much less common as mules the chances of a fertile zebroid mare are very slim. Only ONE case of such a mare was reported : The zebroid mare of a zebra mare x draft horse stallion produced a foal when she was bred back to her sire but the foal died of lightning and she did not survive it much longer.\n\n=== Extant ''Equus'' species: chromosome number ===\n{{See also|Equus (genus)}}\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n!Subgenus\n!Scientific name\n!Common name\n!Chromosome number (2n)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |''Hippotigris''\n\n(Zebras)\n|''Equus zebra''\n|[[Mountain zebra]]\n|32\n|-\n|''Equus grevyi''\n|[[Gr\u00e9vy's zebra]]\n|46\n|-\n|''Equus quagga''\n|[[Plains zebra]]\n|44\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |'''''Asinus''''' \n\n'''(wild asses)'''\n|''Equus africanus''\n|[[African wild ass]]; includes domesticated [[donkey]]\n|62\n|-\n|''Equus hemionus''\n|[[Onager]], hemione, or Asiatic wild ass\n|56\n|-\n|''Equus kiang''\n|[[Kiang]]\n|52 <ref>{{Cite journal|last=J\u00f3nsson|first=H\u00e1kon|last2=Schubert|first2=Mikkel|last3=Seguin-Orlando|first3=Andaine|last4=Ginolhac|first4=Aur\u00e9lien|last5=Petersen|first5=Lillian|last6=Fumagalli|first6=Matteo|last7=Albrechtsen|first7=Anders|last8=Petersen|first8=Bent|last9=Korneliussen|first9=Thorfinn S.|last10=Vilstrup|first10=Julia T.|last11=Lear|first11=Teri|date=2014-12-30|title=Speciation with gene flow in equids despite extensive chromosomal plasticity|url=http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1412627111|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=111|issue=52|pages=18655\u201318660|doi=10.1073/pnas.1412627111|issn=0027-8424|pmc=PMC4284605|pmid=25453089}}</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |''Equus''\n|''Equus ferus caballus''\n|Domesticated [[horse]]\n|64\n|-\n|''Equus ferus przewalskii''\n|[[Przewalski's horse]]\n|66 <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=Allison N.|last2=Peng|first2=Lei|last3=Goto|first3=Hiroki|last4=Chemnick|first4=Leona|last5=Ryder|first5=Oliver A.|last6=Makova|first6=Kateryna D.|date=2009-01-01|title=Horse Domestication and Conservation Genetics of Przewalski's Horse Inferred from Sex Chromosomal and Autosomal Sequences|url=https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/26/1/199/973911|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=199\u2013208|doi=10.1093/molbev/msn239|issn=0737-4038}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:Z\u00e9brulecouch\u00e9.jpg|thumb|left|A zorse]]\nZebroids physically resemble their nonzebra parent, but are striped like a zebra. The stripes generally do not cover the whole body, and might be confined to the legs or spread onto parts of the body or neck. If the nonzebra parent was patterned (such as a [[Roan (horse)|roan]], [[Appaloosa]], [[Pinto horse|pinto]]/[[American Paint Horse|paint]], [[piebald]], or [[skewbald]]), this pattern might be passed down to the zebroid, in which case the stripes are usually confined to non-white areas. The alternative name \"golden zebra\" relates to the interaction of zebra striping and a horse's bay or chestnut colour to give a zebra-like black-on-bay or black-on-chestnut pattern that superficially resembles the extinct [[quagga]]. Zebra-donkey hybrids usually have a dorsal (back) stripe and a ventral (belly) stripe.\n\n[[File:Zorse.jpg|thumb|The hebra Eclyse]]\nZorses combine the zebra striping overlaid on colored areas of the hybrid's coat. Zorses are most often bred using solid-color horses. If the horse parent is piebald (black and white) or skewbald (other color and white), the zorse may inherit the dominant depigmentation genes for white patches. The [[tobiano]] (the most common white modifier found in the horse) directly interacts with the zorse coat to give the white markings. Only the nondepigmented areas will have zebra striping, resulting in a zorse with white patches and striped patches. This effect is seen in the zebroid named Eclyse (a hebra rather than a zorse) born in Stukenbrock, Germany, in 2007 to a zebra mare called Eclipse and a stallion called Ulysses.\n\nZebroids are preferred over zebras for practical uses, such as riding, because the zebra has a different body shape from a [[horse]] or [[donkey]], and consequently it is difficult to find [[Horse tack|tack]] to fit a zebra. However, a zebroid is usually more inclined to be temperamental than a [[purebred]] horse and can be difficult to handle. Zebras, being wild animals, and not domesticated like horses and donkeys, pass on their wild animal traits to their offspring.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Zebras, while not usually very large, are extremely strong and aggressive. Similarly, zorses have a strong temperament and can be aggressive.\n\n==Historical and notable zebroids==\n[[Image:zebroidfoal.jpg|thumbnail|Zebra-horse hybrid foal with quagga-like markings, [[Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum]], [[Tring]], [[England]]]]\n\nIn 1815, Lord Morton mated a quagga stallion to a chestnut [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] mare. The result was a female hybrid which resembled both parents. This provoked the interest of Cossar Ewart, Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh (1882\u20131927) and a keen geneticist. Ewart crossed a zebra stallion with pony mares to investigate the theory of [[telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]], or paternal impression. In ''[[Origin of Species]]'' (1859), [[Charles Darwin]] mentioned four coloured drawings of hybrids between the ass and zebra. He also wrote\n<blockquote>\nIn Lord Morton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|title=On the origin of species, 1859.|date=2009|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0814720585|pages=118\u2013119}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn his book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', Darwin described a hybrid ass-zebra specimen in the British Museum as being dappled on its flanks. He also mentioned a \"triple hybrid, from a bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra\" displayed at [[London Zoo]]. This would have required the zebroid sire to be fertile.\n\nDuring the South African War, the [[Boer]]s crossed Chapman's zebras with ponies, to produce animals for transport work, chiefly for hauling guns. A specimen was captured by British forces and presented to [[King Edward VII]] by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], and was photographed by W. S. Berridge.<ref>''Wonders of Animal Life'', edited by [[John Alexander Hammerton|J. A. Hammerton]] (1930)</ref> Zebras are resistant to sleeping sickness, whereas purebred horses and ponies are not, and  zebra mules hopefully would inherit this resistance.\n\nGrevy's zebra has been crossed with the [[Somali wild ass]] in the early 20th century. [[Zorse]]s were bred by the US government and reported in ''Genetics in Relation to Agriculture'' by E. B. Babcock and R. E. Clausen (early 20th century), in an attempt to investigate inheritance and telegony. The experiments were also reported in ''The Science of Life'' by H G Wells, J Huxley, and G P Wells (around 1929).\n\nInterest in zebra crosses continued in the 1970s. In 1973, a cross between a zebra and a donkey was foaled at the Jerusalem Zoo. They called it a \"hamzab\". In the 1970s, the [[Colchester Zoo]] in England bred zedonks, at first by accident and later to create a disease-resistant riding and draft animal. The experiment was discontinued when zoos became more conservation-minded. A number of hybrids were kept at the zoo after this; the last died in 2009.<ref>{{cite press release| title = Colchester Zoo mourns the loss of Shadow the Zeedonk| url = http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| date = 3 April 2009| publisher = Colchester Zoo| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174954/http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| archivedate = 8 July 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref> One adult still remains at the tourist attraction of [[Groombridge Place]]<ref>{{cite web |title=The Enchanted Forest |url=http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |work=Groombridge Place Gardens |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729084438/http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |archivedate=29 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> near Tunbridge Wells in Kent.\n\n===21st century===\nToday, various zebroids are bred as riding and draft animals, and as curiosities in circuses and smaller zoos.

In most cases, the sire is a zebra [[stallion]]. Offspring of a donkey sire and zebra dam called a '''donkra''' or '''zebra hinny''' and offspring of a horse sire and a zebra dam called a '''hebra''' do exist, but are rare and are usually sterile and infertile. Zebroids have been bred since the 19th century. [[Charles Darwin]] noted several zebra hybrids in his works.\n\n==Types==\nZebroid is the term generally used for all zebra hybrids. The different hybrids are generally named using a [[portmanteau]] of the [[wikt:sire#Noun|sire]]'s name and the [[wikt:dam#Noun 2|dam]]'s name. Generally, no distinction is made as to which zebra species is used. Many times, when zebras are crossbred, they develop some form of [[dwarfism]]. Breeding of different branches of the equine family, which does not occur in the wild, generally results in infertile offspring. The combination of sire and dam also affects the offspring [[phenotype]].\n\nA zorse is the offspring of a [[zebra]] stallion and a horse [[mare]]. This cross is also called a zebrula, zebrule, or zebra mule. The rarer reverse pairing is sometimes called a hebra, horbra, zebrinny, zebret, or zebra hinny. Like most other animal hybrids, the zorse is sterile.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.equinepost.com/resources/breeds/showBreed.asp?ID=150|title= Zorse Breed Description |work= Breeding References|publisher= EquinePost |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710195153/http://www.equinepost.com/resources/breeds/showBreed.asp?ID=150 |archivedate=2011-07-10}}</ref>\n\nA zony is the offspring of a zebra stallion and a pony mare.

Like [[mule]]s and [[hinny]]s, however, they are generally genetically unable to breed, due to an odd number of chromosomes disrupting [[meiosis]].\n\n==Genetics==\nDonkeys and wild equids have different numbers of [[chromosome]]s. A donkey has 62 chromosomes; the zebra has between 32 and 46 (depending on the species). In spite of this difference, viable hybrids are possible, provided the gene combination in the hybrid allows for embryonic development to birth. A hybrid has a number of chromosomes somewhere in between. The chromosome difference makes female hybrids poorly fertile and male hybrids generally sterile, due to a phenomenon called [[Haldane's rule]]. The difference in chromosome number is most likely due to horses having two longer chromosomes that contain similar gene content to four zebra chromosomes.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Chromosome Studies of a Donkey-Grevy Zebra Hybrid | journal = Chromosoma | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | year = 1964 | author = K.

And just as female mules and hinnies only very rarely produce offspring the same appears to be true of zebroids. Considering zebroids are much less common as mules the chances of a fertile zebroid mare are very slim. Only ONE case of such a mare was reported : The zebroid mare of a zebra mare x draft horse stallion produced a foal when she was bred back to her sire but the foal died of lightning and she did not survive it much longer.\n\n=== Extant ''Equus'' species: chromosome number ===\n{{See also|Equus (genus)}}\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n!Subgenus\n!Scientific name\n!Common name\n!Chromosome number (2n)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |''Hippotigris''\n\n(Zebras)\n|''Equus zebra''\n|[[Mountain zebra]]\n|32\n|-\n|''Equus grevyi''\n|[[Gr\u00e9vy's zebra]]\n|46\n|-\n|''Equus quagga''\n|[[Plains zebra]]\n|44\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |'''''Asinus''''' \n\n'''(wild asses)'''\n|''Equus africanus''\n|[[African wild ass]]; includes domesticated [[donkey]]\n|62\n|-\n|''Equus hemionus''\n|[[Onager]], hemione, or Asiatic wild ass\n|56\n|-\n|''Equus kiang''\n|[[Kiang]]\n|52 <ref>{{Cite journal|last=J\u00f3nsson|first=H\u00e1kon|last2=Schubert|first2=Mikkel|last3=Seguin-Orlando|first3=Andaine|last4=Ginolhac|first4=Aur\u00e9lien|last5=Petersen|first5=Lillian|last6=Fumagalli|first6=Matteo|last7=Albrechtsen|first7=Anders|last8=Petersen|first8=Bent|last9=Korneliussen|first9=Thorfinn S.|last10=Vilstrup|first10=Julia T.|last11=Lear|first11=Teri|date=2014-12-30|title=Speciation with gene flow in equids despite extensive chromosomal plasticity|url=http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1412627111|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=111|issue=52|pages=18655\u201318660|doi=10.1073/pnas.1412627111|issn=0027-8424|pmc=PMC4284605|pmid=25453089}}</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |''Equus''\n|''Equus ferus caballus''\n|Domesticated [[horse]]\n|64\n|-\n|''Equus ferus przewalskii''\n|[[Przewalski's horse]]\n|66 <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=Allison N.|last2=Peng|first2=Lei|last3=Goto|first3=Hiroki|last4=Chemnick|first4=Leona|last5=Ryder|first5=Oliver A.|last6=Makova|first6=Kateryna D.|date=2009-01-01|title=Horse Domestication and Conservation Genetics of Przewalski's Horse Inferred from Sex Chromosomal and Autosomal Sequences|url=https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/26/1/199/973911|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=199\u2013208|doi=10.1093/molbev/msn239|issn=0737-4038}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:Z\u00e9brulecouch\u00e9.jpg|thumb|left|A zorse]]\nZebroids physically resemble their nonzebra parent, but are striped like a zebra. The stripes generally do not cover the whole body, and might be confined to the legs or spread onto parts of the body or neck. If the nonzebra parent was patterned (such as a [[Roan (horse)|roan]], [[Appaloosa]], [[Pinto horse|pinto]]/[[American Paint Horse|paint]], [[piebald]], or [[skewbald]]), this pattern might be passed down to the zebroid, in which case the stripes are usually confined to non-white areas. The alternative name \"golden zebra\" relates to the interaction of zebra striping and a horse's bay or chestnut colour to give a zebra-like black-on-bay or black-on-chestnut pattern that superficially resembles the extinct [[quagga]]. Zebra-donkey hybrids usually have a dorsal (back) stripe and a ventral (belly) stripe.\n\n[[File:Zorse.jpg|thumb|The hebra Eclyse]]\nZorses combine the zebra striping overlaid on colored areas of the hybrid's coat. Zorses are most often bred using solid-color horses. If the horse parent is piebald (black and white) or skewbald (other color and white), the zorse may inherit the dominant depigmentation genes for white patches. The [[tobiano]] (the most common white modifier found in the horse) directly interacts with the zorse coat to give the white markings. Only the nondepigmented areas will have zebra striping, resulting in a zorse with white patches and striped patches. This effect is seen in the zebroid named Eclyse (a hebra rather than a zorse) born in Stukenbrock, Germany, in 2007 to a zebra mare called Eclipse and a stallion called Ulysses.\n\nZebroids are preferred over zebras for practical uses, such as riding, because the zebra has a different body shape from a [[horse]] or [[donkey]], and consequently it is difficult to find [[Horse tack|tack]] to fit a zebra. However, a zebroid is usually more inclined to be temperamental than a [[purebred]] horse and can be difficult to handle. Zebras, being wild animals, and not domesticated like horses and donkeys, pass on their wild animal traits to their offspring.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Zebras, while not usually very large, are extremely strong and aggressive. Similarly, zorses have a strong temperament and can be aggressive.\n\n==Historical and notable zebroids==\n[[Image:zebroidfoal.jpg|thumbnail|Zebra-horse hybrid foal with quagga-like markings, [[Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum]], [[Tring]], [[England]]]]\n\nIn 1815, Lord Morton mated a quagga stallion to a chestnut [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] mare. The result was a female hybrid which resembled both parents. This provoked the interest of Cossar Ewart, Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh (1882\u20131927) and a keen geneticist. Ewart crossed a zebra stallion with pony mares to investigate the theory of [[telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]], or paternal impression. In ''[[Origin of Species]]'' (1859), [[Charles Darwin]] mentioned four coloured drawings of hybrids between the ass and zebra. He also wrote\n<blockquote>\nIn Lord Morton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|title=On the origin of species, 1859.|date=2009|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0814720585|pages=118\u2013119}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn his book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', Darwin described a hybrid ass-zebra specimen in the British Museum as being dappled on its flanks. He also mentioned a \"triple hybrid, from a bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra\" displayed at [[London Zoo]]. This would have required the zebroid sire to be fertile.\n\nDuring the South African War, the [[Boer]]s crossed Chapman's zebras with ponies, to produce animals for transport work, chiefly for hauling guns. A specimen was captured by British forces and presented to [[King Edward VII]] by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], and was photographed by W. S. Berridge.<ref>''Wonders of Animal Life'', edited by [[John Alexander Hammerton|J. A. Hammerton]] (1930)</ref> Zebras are resistant to sleeping sickness, whereas purebred horses and ponies are not, and  zebra mules hopefully would inherit this resistance.\n\nGrevy's zebra has been crossed with the [[Somali wild ass]] in the early 20th century. [[Zorse]]s were bred by the US government and reported in ''Genetics in Relation to Agriculture'' by E. B. Babcock and R. E. Clausen (early 20th century), in an attempt to investigate inheritance and telegony. The experiments were also reported in ''The Science of Life'' by H G Wells, J Huxley, and G P Wells (around 1929).\n\nInterest in zebra crosses continued in the 1970s. In 1973, a cross between a zebra and a donkey was foaled at the Jerusalem Zoo. They called it a \"hamzab\". In the 1970s, the [[Colchester Zoo]] in England bred zedonks, at first by accident and later to create a disease-resistant riding and draft animal. The experiment was discontinued when zoos became more conservation-minded. A number of hybrids were kept at the zoo after this; the last died in 2009.<ref>{{cite press release| title = Colchester Zoo mourns the loss of Shadow the Zeedonk| url = http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| date = 3 April 2009| publisher = Colchester Zoo| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174954/http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| archivedate = 8 July 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref> One adult still remains at the tourist attraction of [[Groombridge Place]]<ref>{{cite web |title=The Enchanted Forest |url=http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |work=Groombridge Place Gardens |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729084438/http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |archivedate=29 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> near Tunbridge Wells in Kent.\n\n===21st century===\nToday, various zebroids are bred as riding and draft animals, and as curiosities in circuses and smaller zoos.
