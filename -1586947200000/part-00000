Renting a plot of land where a sauna stands from the landlord, Seo Myung-dong, he has to face Myung-dong's temperamental granddaughter and the sauna's owner, Bo-ah. For the past five years, Bo-ah, a failing [[webtoon]] artist, has been holing up in the sauna after a conflict with a popular webtoon artist over ownership rights led to her being shunned from the community. Myung-dong asks Choi-go to admit Bo-ah as a part-timer in his restaurant in exchange for a lower rent fee, hoping that she can regain her spirit.\n\nBo-ah is hostile at Choi-go for disturbing her peace and regards him as simply a rich [[bourgeoisie]] who wanted to experience the life of a commoner. Helped by her childhood friends: Hwang Min-ah, Oh Yeong-ho, and Kim Kyu-man, they try to sabotage the joint through various means, such as handing out scathing flyers, which backfires when it turns viral and therefore garners attention. However, Choi-go's seriousness at his job and unfailing kindness to Bo-ah cause her to begin questioning her first impression. Since Choi-go never studied cooking, the restaurant operates at a loss until he hires Andrew Kang, a [[Homelessness|bum]] with a [[tremor]] who used to work at a [[Michelin Guide|three-star Michelin restaurant]].\n\nAround the time when Bo-ah softens and falls in love with Choi-go, two adversaries come into the scene. The first is Choi-go's ex-girlfriend, Moon So-dam, who works at a food TV program and wants to reconnect with Choi-go by doing a free publicity of the joint. During the broadcast, Min-ah, Yeong-ho, and Kyu-man successfully do a sabotage, causing its suspension for two months. So-dam becomes suspicious of Bo-ah, who did not participate in the plan, tries to warn Choi-go, who refuses to believe her, and attempts to catch the trio off-guard when they try another sabotage. However, Andrew bails them at the last minute and makes them promise not to do it again. The second adversary is Choi-go's domineering mother, So Oh-sook, who is angry at him for quitting his previous job and attempts to reduce his chance of winning big by opening a chicken joint down the street after tricking Bo-ah into giving her his recipe.\n\nFeeling guilty, Bo-ah admits her previous actions to Choi-go and considers resigning. While upset, Choi-go comes to realize that he has grown to love her and confesses, begging her to stay. Min-ah, Yeong-ho, and Kyu-man are initially livid at Bo-ah for not telling them to stop harassing Choi-go sooner, but quickly make amends when a tragedy strikes her: the death of Myung-dong. During the funeral, Bo-ah's deadbeat father, Gong-cheol suddenly appears to take his legal inheritance, despite the fact that his father had left all his possessions to Bo-ah, and redevelop the neighborhood, which would raze the chicken joint to the ground. Assisted by her friends, Bo-ah manages to convince the neighborhood not to sell their land.\n\nSeveral months later, Choi-go's chicken joint is growing popular. Oh-sook chooses to stop bothering Choi-go and sell her joint. So-dam has moved on and is dating Choi-go's brother, Joon-hyuk, with whom she grew closer while investigating Bo-ah and her friends. Thinking that he has nothing more to offer to Choi-go, Andrew resigns and opens a restaurant nearby. Bo-ah, meanwhile, finally decides to draw webtoon again, having made a promise to Myung-dong to live her life to the fullest.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Park Sun-ho]] as Park Choi-go (28 years old)\n: An employee of a large corporation who quits his job to open his own chicken restaurant, which he considers a dream project.<ref name=\"Newsen\">{{cite news|url=http://www.newsen.com/news_view.php?uid=201808221036480410|title=\ubc15\uc120\ud638X\uae40\uc18c\ud61c, \ud55c\uc77c\ud569\uc791 \ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8 '\ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uce58\ud0a8' \uce90\uc2a4\ud305 \ud655\uc815(\uacf5\uc2dd)|website=Newsen|publisher=Newsen|accessdate=December 22, 2018|language=ko}}</ref> He is a very optimistic and idealistic man, sometimes outrageously so.\n* [[Kim So-hye]] as Seo Bo-ah (25 years old)\n: The owner of a public bathhouse that her grandfather rented out without her consent who dreams of becoming a webtoon artist.<ref name=\"genre\"/> She has a negative view of the world after her work was rejected five years ago because of a feud with another webtoon artist, regarding everyone new to her as a nuisance.\n* Joo Woo-jae as Andrew Kang (33 years old)\n: A once promising chef who is currently homeless.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=410&aid=0000533628|script-title=ko:\ub4dc\ub77c\ub9e5\uc2a4 '\ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uce58\ud0a8' \uce21 \"\ubc15\uc120\ud638\u00b7\uae40\uc18c\ud61c \ucd9c\uc5f0..\ub0b4\ub144 1\uc6d42\uc77c \uccab \ubc29\uc1a1\"|website=Naver|publisher=MK Sports|accessdate=December 22, 2018|language=ko}}</ref> A serious person at all times, Andrew has a bad case of [[tremor]] which discourages him from doing physical work for a long time.

Renting a plot of land where a sauna stands from the landlord, Seo Myung-dong, he has to face Myung-dong's temperamental granddaughter and the sauna's owner, Bo-ah. For the past five years, Bo-ah, a failing [[webtoon]] artist, has been holing up in the sauna after a conflict with a popular webtoon artist over ownership rights led to her being shunned from the community. Myung-dong asks Choi-go to admit Bo-ah as a part-timer in his restaurant in exchange for a lower rent fee, hoping that she can regain her spirit.\n\nBo-ah is hostile at Choi-go for disturbing her peace and regards him as simply a rich [[bourgeoisie]] who wanted to experience the life of a commoner. Helped by her childhood friends: Hwang Min-ah, Oh Yeong-ho, and Kim Kyu-man, they try to sabotage the joint through various means, such as handing out scathing flyers, which backfires when it turns viral and therefore garners attention. However, Choi-go's seriousness at his job and unfailing kindness to Bo-ah cause her to begin questioning her first impression. Since Choi-go never studied cooking, the restaurant operates at a loss until he hires Andrew Kang, a [[Homelessness|bum]] with a [[tremor]] who used to work at a [[Michelin Guide|three-star Michelin restaurant]].\n\nAround the time when Bo-ah softens and falls in love with Choi-go, two adversaries come into the scene. The first is Choi-go's ex-girlfriend, Moon So-dam, who works at a food TV program and wants to reconnect with Choi-go by doing a free publicity of the joint. During the broadcast, Min-ah, Yeong-ho, and Kyu-man successfully do a sabotage, causing its suspension for two months. So-dam becomes suspicious of Bo-ah, who did not participate in the plan, tries to warn Choi-go, who refuses to believe her, and attempts to catch the trio off-guard when they try another sabotage. However, Andrew bails them at the last minute and makes them promise not to do it again. The second adversary is Choi-go's domineering mother, So Oh-sook, who is angry at him for quitting his previous job and attempts to reduce his chance of winning big by opening a chicken joint down the street after tricking Bo-ah into giving her his recipe.\n\nFeeling guilty, Bo-ah admits her previous actions to Choi-go and considers resigning. While upset, Choi-go comes to realize that he has grown to love her and confesses, begging her to stay. Min-ah, Yeong-ho, and Kyu-man are initially livid at Bo-ah for not telling them to stop harassing Choi-go sooner, but quickly make amends when a tragedy strikes her: the death of Myung-dong. During the funeral, Bo-ah's deadbeat father, Gong-cheol suddenly appears to take his legal inheritance, despite the fact that his father had left all his possessions to Bo-ah, and redevelop the neighborhood, which would raze the chicken joint to the ground. Assisted by her friends, Bo-ah manages to convince the neighborhood not to sell their land.\n\nSeveral months later, Choi-go's chicken joint is growing popular. Oh-sook chooses to stop bothering Choi-go and sell her joint. So-dam has moved on and is dating Choi-go's brother, Joon-hyuk, with whom she grew closer while investigating Bo-ah and her friends. Thinking that he has nothing more to offer to Choi-go, Andrew resigns and opens a restaurant nearby. Bo-ah, meanwhile, finally decides to draw webtoon again, having made a promise to Myung-dong to live her life to the fullest.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Park Sun-ho]] as Park Choi-go (28 years old)\n: An employee of a large corporation who quits his job to open his own chicken restaurant, which he considers a dream project.<ref name=\"Newsen\">{{cite news|url=http://www.newsen.com/news_view.php?uid=201808221036480410|title=\ubc15\uc120\ud638X\uae40\uc18c\ud61c, \ud55c\uc77c\ud569\uc791 \ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8 '\ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uce58\ud0a8' \uce90\uc2a4\ud305 \ud655\uc815(\uacf5\uc2dd)|website=Newsen|publisher=Newsen|accessdate=December 22, 2018|language=ko}}</ref> He is a very optimistic and idealistic man, sometimes outrageously so.\n* [[Kim So-hye]] as Seo Bo-ah (25 years old)\n: The owner of a public bathhouse that her grandfather rented out without her consent who dreams of becoming a webtoon artist.<ref name=\"genre\"/> She has a negative view of the world after her work was rejected five years ago because of a feud with another webtoon artist, regarding everyone new to her as a nuisance.\n* Joo Woo-jae as Andrew Kang (33 years old)\n: A once promising chef who is currently homeless.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=410&aid=0000533628|script-title=ko:\ub4dc\ub77c\ub9e5\uc2a4 '\ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uce58\ud0a8' \uce21 \"\ubc15\uc120\ud638\u00b7\uae40\uc18c\ud61c \ucd9c\uc5f0..\ub0b4\ub144 1\uc6d42\uc77c \uccab \ubc29\uc1a1\"|website=Naver|publisher=MK Sports|accessdate=December 22, 2018|language=ko}}</ref> A serious person at all times, Andrew has a bad case of [[tremor]] which discourages him from doing physical work for a long time.

The team is owned by [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] [[BMW]], [[Infiniti]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Mini (marque)|MINI]], and [[Subaru]] dealer Dennis Reinbold.  Off the track, Dreyer & Reinbold Racing (DRR) have spent thousands of hours as the national spokesperson & advocate for \"Racing for Kids,\" a national youth charitable foundation.  On behalf of \"Racing for Kids,\" DRR has visited more than 20,000 children in over 400 hospitals worldwide, and raised nearly $5 million for local children's health initiatives.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dreyerreinboldracing.com/team/owners.aspx | work=Dreyer & Reinbold Racing Official Website | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008005511/http://www.dreyerreinboldracing.com/team/owners.aspx | archive-date=2011-10-08 | df= }}</ref>\n\n==2000\u20132006 Indy Racing League / IndyCar Series==\n\nFounded in [[2000 in IRL|2000]], DRR was one of the few teams that consistently ran the [[Infiniti]] engine until they left the series, then switched to [[Chevrolet]] and finally to [[Honda]] in [[2005 in IRL|2005]]. When Buhl retired from the cockpit in [[2004 in IRL|2004]], he placed [[Felipe Giaffone]] in the cockpit, followed by [[Roger Yasukawa]] with financial backing from Honda. With Honda backing gone for [[2006 in IRL|2006]], some doubted if the team would continue, as Buhl had consistently stated that if running the team did not make financial sense, he would shut it down. However, sponsorship was found and the team named 2000 series champion [[Buddy Lazier]] their primary driver. In 2002 the team ran a second car for [[Sarah Fisher]], who became the first woman in North American motorsports history to win the pole position for a major-league open-wheel race, earning the pole at Kentucky Speedway. In the [[2006 Indianapolis 500|2006]] [[Indianapolis 500]], the team's second car was driven by [[Al Unser Jr.]].\n\nThe team's only win came in their debut race, 2000 IRL season opener at [[Walt Disney World Speedway]], when Buhl stunned the series with a win from the 22nd starting position. In 2006 the team scored their best finish in years when [[Ryan Briscoe]] showed a great turn of speed in the wet at [[Watkins Glen International]] to get on the podium. During that time, other good results in the season were few and far between.\n[[Image:BuddyRiceIndy2008.jpg|right|thumb|The team's #15 car driven by Buddy Rice in practice for the [[2008 Indianapolis 500]]]]\n\n==2007\u20132009 IndyCar Series==\n\nFor 2007 the team has recruited two ex-[[Fernandez Racing]] engineers and added a new sponsor. On January 31, 2007, [[2004 Indianapolis 500]] winner [[Buddy Rice]] and  Sarah Fisher would drive for the team.  Rice brought in respectable performances, finishing 9th in points with three top-five finishes. Fisher struggled to 17th place in points after playing second fiddle to the \"A Team\" often being given less than par equipment.  Fisher announced in late 2007 that she would leave the team due to lack of commitment from the team to her efforts.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nRice returned to the team in [[2008 IndyCar Series season|2008]] while the team's second car was shared by [[Milka Duno]] and [[Townsend Bell]], with all three drivers competing in the [[2008 Indianapolis 500]]. Both Rice and Bell finished in the top-10 (8th and 10th respectively) while Duno finished 19th in the race. Rice finished 16th in points with a best finish of fourth at Watkins Glen.\n\n2009 saw Dreyer & Reinbold bring on a completely new driver lineup from 2008. Joining the team full-time was British rookie [[Mike Conway]], who most had previously competed in the [[GP2 Series]]. A second full-time entry was shared between [[Darren Manning]] (two races), [[Milka Duno]], and [[Tomas Scheckter]]. In addition, Roger Yasukawa also returned to the team for the race at [[Twin Ring Motegi]]. The team also fielded cars for [[Richard Petty Motorsports]] driven by [[John Andretti]] and for [[Kingdom Racing]] and driver [[Davey Hamilton]] in the [[2009 Indianapolis 500]]. The cars of Duno, Andretti, and Conway all struggled to qualify but made the field on bump day, the final day of qualifications. Conway, Andretti, and Duno were the last-placed cars running at the finish in the 18th, 19th, and 20th positions respectively. Throughout the rest of the season, Conway struggled for consistency, only finishing nine of the seventeen races, but was fast at times on the road courses, finishing on the podium in third at [[Infineon Raceway]].\n\n==2010\u20132011 Izod IndyCar Series==\n\nOn 2 February 2010 it was announced that [[Justin Wilson (racing driver)|Justin Wilson]] would be joining Dreyer & Reinbold Racing for the [[2010 IndyCar Series season|2010 IndyCar season]] in the #22 Z-Line Designs car.

The team is owned by [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] [[BMW]], [[Infiniti]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Mini (marque)|MINI]], and [[Subaru]] dealer Dennis Reinbold.  Off the track, Dreyer & Reinbold Racing (DRR) have spent thousands of hours as the national spokesperson & advocate for \"Racing for Kids,\" a national youth charitable foundation.  On behalf of \"Racing for Kids,\" DRR has visited more than 20,000 children in over 400 hospitals worldwide, and raised nearly $5 million for local children's health initiatives.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dreyerreinboldracing.com/team/owners.aspx | work=Dreyer & Reinbold Racing Official Website | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008005511/http://www.dreyerreinboldracing.com/team/owners.aspx | archive-date=2011-10-08 | df= }}</ref>\n\n==2000\u20132006 Indy Racing League / IndyCar Series==\n\nFounded in [[2000 in IRL|2000]], DRR was one of the few teams that consistently ran the [[Infiniti]] engine until they left the series, then switched to [[Chevrolet]] and finally to [[Honda]] in [[2005 in IRL|2005]]. When Buhl retired from the cockpit in [[2004 in IRL|2004]], he placed [[Felipe Giaffone]] in the cockpit, followed by [[Roger Yasukawa]] with financial backing from Honda. With Honda backing gone for [[2006 in IRL|2006]], some doubted if the team would continue, as Buhl had consistently stated that if running the team did not make financial sense, he would shut it down. However, sponsorship was found and the team named 2000 series champion [[Buddy Lazier]] their primary driver. In 2002 the team ran a second car for [[Sarah Fisher]], who became the first woman in North American motorsports history to win the pole position for a major-league open-wheel race, earning the pole at Kentucky Speedway. In the [[2006 Indianapolis 500|2006]] [[Indianapolis 500]], the team's second car was driven by [[Al Unser Jr.]].\n\nThe team's only win came in their debut race, 2000 IRL season opener at [[Walt Disney World Speedway]], when Buhl stunned the series with a win from the 22nd starting position. In 2006 the team scored their best finish in years when [[Ryan Briscoe]] showed a great turn of speed in the wet at [[Watkins Glen International]] to get on the podium. During that time, other good results in the season were few and far between.\n[[Image:BuddyRiceIndy2008.jpg|right|thumb|The team's #15 car driven by Buddy Rice in practice for the [[2008 Indianapolis 500]]]]\n\n==2007\u20132009 IndyCar Series==\n\nFor 2007 the team has recruited two ex-[[Fernandez Racing]] engineers and added a new sponsor. On January 31, 2007, [[2004 Indianapolis 500]] winner [[Buddy Rice]] and  Sarah Fisher would drive for the team.  Rice brought in respectable performances, finishing 9th in points with three top-five finishes. Fisher struggled to 17th place in points after playing second fiddle to the \"A Team\" often being given less than par equipment.  Fisher announced in late 2007 that she would leave the team due to lack of commitment from the team to her efforts.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nRice returned to the team in [[2008 IndyCar Series season|2008]] while the team's second car was shared by [[Milka Duno]] and [[Townsend Bell]], with all three drivers competing in the [[2008 Indianapolis 500]]. Both Rice and Bell finished in the top-10 (8th and 10th respectively) while Duno finished 19th in the race. Rice finished 16th in points with a best finish of fourth at Watkins Glen.\n\n2009 saw Dreyer & Reinbold bring on a completely new driver lineup from 2008. Joining the team full-time was British rookie [[Mike Conway]], who most had previously competed in the [[GP2 Series]]. A second full-time entry was shared between [[Darren Manning]] (two races), [[Milka Duno]], and [[Tomas Scheckter]]. In addition, Roger Yasukawa also returned to the team for the race at [[Twin Ring Motegi]]. The team also fielded cars for [[Richard Petty Motorsports]] driven by [[John Andretti]] and for [[Kingdom Racing]] and driver [[Davey Hamilton]] in the [[2009 Indianapolis 500]]. The cars of Duno, Andretti, and Conway all struggled to qualify but made the field on bump day, the final day of qualifications. Conway, Andretti, and Duno were the last-placed cars running at the finish in the 18th, 19th, and 20th positions respectively. Throughout the rest of the season, Conway struggled for consistency, only finishing nine of the seventeen races, but was fast at times on the road courses, finishing on the podium in third at [[Infineon Raceway]].\n\n==2010\u20132011 Izod IndyCar Series==\n\nOn 2 February 2010 it was announced that [[Justin Wilson (racing driver)|Justin Wilson]] would be joining Dreyer & Reinbold Racing for the [[2010 IndyCar Series season|2010 IndyCar season]] in the #22 Z-Line Designs car.  Wilson was to be partnered throughout the season by returning driver [[Mike Conway]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/81215 | work=Autosport | date=February 2, 2010}}</ref>\nFor the opening race in Brazil they were joined by [[Bia Figueiredo|Ana Beatriz]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/81710 | work=Autosport | date=February 26, 2010}}</ref> For the 94th running of the Indianapolis 500 the team was expanded to run four cars for [[Tomas Scheckter]] and Ana Beatriz.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/83542 | work=Autosport | date=May 12, 2010}}</ref>  After Conway was sidelined for an accident in the closing stages of the Indy 500, Wilson was partnered by [[Tomas Scheckter]], [[Graham Rahal]] and [[Paul Tracy]]. It was announced that he will be joined by [[J. R. Hildebrand]] who will make his Indycar debut at [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course|Mid-Ohio]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/85084 | work=Autosport | date=July 8, 2010}}</ref>\nThe [[Exhibition Place#Race course|Toronto]] event was Wilson's breakthrough event of the season, after being in the top two in each of the three practice sessions, he dominated qualifying. Wilson made it to the Firestone Fast Six shootout without using a single set of the faster red walled (alternate compound) tires, and easily took the pole for the race after posting a record lap time of 1:00.2710s.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://justinwilson.co.uk/site.php?section=8&offset=75&item=838 | work=JustinWilson.co.uk}}</ref> Wilson went on to lead much of the race, however after losing grip coming off of turn 11 on a restart late in the race, his car spun and relinquished the lead to [[Will Power]].

The season began on 9 April 2007. Originally scheduled to end on 4 November, the last round was moved to Saturday 3 November 2007, due to [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]]\u2019s [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] participation.<ref>[https://archive.is/20071010104729/http://www.fotball.no/t2.aspx?p=51834&x=1&a=205207&cat=51834 \"Siste serierunde flyttet\"], ''NFF'', 31 August 2007.

The result left Brann with an unassailable seven-point lead over Viking, with two games left to play. Brann thus claimed their first league title since 1963, and their third league title in all.

While Peru felt that the matter was already decided in the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]] of 1941, Ecuador did not agree with the [[Rio de Janeiro Protocol]]. Later in 1998 the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol ruled that the border of the undelimited zone was indeed the line of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor, as Peru had been claiming since the 1940s. \n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, both sides increased their military presence along the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor]] area and Cenepa Valley, starting an escalating spiral of tension and provocation that finally resulted in another military confrontation in 1995, the [[Cenepa War]].\n\nWhile the name ''Paquisha War'' is widely used by the international community and Ecuador, in Spanish this incident is also known as the '''Falso Paquisha War''' (''Conflicto del Falso Paquisha'') in Peru and, occasionally, as the '''Paquisha Incident''' or the '''Upper Comaina Conflict''' (''conflicto del Alto Comaina'').\n\n==Historical background==\n''For details on the history of the border dispute between Ecuador and Peru, please see [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute]].''\n\n===The Paquisha or \"Fake Paquisha\" Incident===\nThe dispute revolved around the existence of three Ecuadorian military outposts, called Paquisha, Mayaico, and Machinaza, located in the valley of the Comaina River, beyond the eastern slopes of the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor|Condor range]] (in Spanish, ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'').

While Peru felt that the matter was already decided in the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]] of 1941, Ecuador did not agree with the [[Rio de Janeiro Protocol]]. Later in 1998 the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol ruled that the border of the undelimited zone was indeed the line of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor, as Peru had been claiming since the 1940s. \n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, both sides increased their military presence along the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor]] area and Cenepa Valley, starting an escalating spiral of tension and provocation that finally resulted in another military confrontation in 1995, the [[Cenepa War]].\n\nWhile the name ''Paquisha War'' is widely used by the international community and Ecuador, in Spanish this incident is also known as the '''Falso Paquisha War''' (''Conflicto del Falso Paquisha'') in Peru and, occasionally, as the '''Paquisha Incident''' or the '''Upper Comaina Conflict''' (''conflicto del Alto Comaina'').\n\n==Historical background==\n''For details on the history of the border dispute between Ecuador and Peru, please see [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute]].''\n\n===The Paquisha or \"Fake Paquisha\" Incident===\nThe dispute revolved around the existence of three Ecuadorian military outposts, called Paquisha, Mayaico, and Machinaza, located in the valley of the Comaina River, beyond the eastern slopes of the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor|Condor range]] (in Spanish, ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''). While these posts were located in the as yet non-demarcated zone of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border, the establishment of these posts was considered by the Peruvian Government as a violation of a ''[[status quo]]'' line arranged between the military leaders of both countries in the course of several meetings at the end of the 1970s.

{"title_page": "Crist\u00f3bal Halffter", "text_new": "'''Crist\u00f3bal Halffter Jim\u00e9nez-Encina''' (born 24 March 1930) is a Spanish [[classical music|classical]] [[composer]]. He is the nephew of two other composers, [[Rodolfo Halffter|Rodolfo]] and [[Ernesto Halffter]].\n\n==Early years==\nHalffter was born in Madrid, but in 1936 the family moved to [[Velbert]], Germany, to escape the [[Spanish Civil War]]. They returned to Madrid in 1939, and Halftter studied with [[Conrado del Campo]] at the [[Madrid Royal Conservatory]], graduating in 1951 {{harv|Alonso|2001}}. He continued his studies, outside of his university education, with [[Alexandre Tansman]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Jolivet]] in Paris.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1955, Halffter was appointed conductor of the [[Manuel de Falla|Falla]] orchestra. He forged a successful career as composer and [[conducting|conductor]], writing music which combined a traditional Spanish element with [[avant-garde]] techniques. His [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] ''Piano Concerto'' (1953) won the National Music Prize in 1954 {{harv|Alonso|2001}}. In 1961 he became Professor of Composition at the Royal Conservatory of Madrid, where he became Director in 1964 but remained only until 1966 {{harv|Kennedy|2006}}. Among his notable pupils are [[Jean-Luc Darbellay]] {{harv|Anon.|n.d.(b)}}, [[David Philip Hefti]] {{harv|Anon.|n.d.(c)}}, and [[Javier Jacinto]] {{harv|Jacinto|2008}}.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Halffter composed a number of works relating to human rights, including the 1968 choral work ''Yes, speak out, yes'' {{harv|Cummings|n.d.}}. He was awarded Spain's highest award for composition, the [[Premio Nacional de M\u00fasica]], in 1989 {{harv|Alonso|2001}}. Also he has received the 2009 [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] in Contemporary Music {{harv|Anon.|2009}}.\n\nHalffter's works include the opera ''Don Quijote'' (2000) {{harv|Rob\u00e9s, Halffter, Amor\u00f3s, and Cervantes|2004}}. His second opera, ''Lazarus'', was premiered in 2008 at the [[Opernhaus Kiel|Kiel Opera House]] to celebrate its centenary {{harv|Reininghaus|2008}}. A third opera, ''Schachnovelle'', with a libretto by Wolfgang Haendeler after the [[The Royal Game|eponymous novel]] by [[Stefan Zweig]], was scheduled to premiere at the same house in May 2013 {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}.\n\nCrist\u00f3bal Halffter is regarded as the most important Spanish composer of the generation of composers designated the [[Generaci\u00f3n del 51]] ({{harvnb|Alonso|2001}}; {{harvnb|Perez Castillo|2001}}).\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n* Concerto for piano and orchestra (1953)\n* String Quartet no. 1 (1955)\n* ''Tres piezas'', for string quartet (1956)\n* ''Introducci\u00f3n, fuga y finale'', for piano (1957)\n* ''Codex I'' for guitar (1963)\n* ''L\u00edneas y puntos'', for 20 wind instruments and electroacoustics (1966)\n* ''Anillos'', for orchestra (1966)\n* ''Cantata Symposium'' (1966)\n* ''Yes, speak out, yes'', cantata (1966)\n* ''L\u00edneas y puntos'', for 20 wind instruments and tape (1967)\n* ''Noche pasiva del sentido'', for soprano, two percussionists and 4 tape recorders (1970)\n* String Quartet no. 2 \"M\u00e9moires\" (1970)\n* ''Llanto por las v\u00edctimas de la violencia'', for chamber group and electroacoustics (1971)\n* ''Platero y yo'', for choir, soloists, and narrator, based on the poem by [[Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez]] (1974)\n* Cello Concerto no. 1 (1974)\n* ''Eleg\u00eda de la muerte de tres poetas espa\u00f1oles'' (1975)\n* ''Variaciones sobre la resonancia de un grito'', for 11 instruments, tape, and live electronics (1976\u201377)\n* String Quartet no. 3 (1978)\n* ''Officium defunctuorum'', for orchestra and chorus (1979)\n* Violin Concerto no. 1 (1979)\n* ''Fantasia sobre una sonoridad de G.

Since the mid-1990s, they have been supported by trombonist [[Gabrial McNair]] and trumpeter [[Stephen Bradley (musician)|Stephen Bradley]] in live performances.\n\nThough their [[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|1992 eponymous debut album]] failed to make an impact, its [[ska punk]] inspired follow-up ''[[The Beacon Street Collection]]'' sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, over three times as many as its predecessor. The band's [[RIAA certification|diamond-certified]] album ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]'' (1995) benefited from the resurgence of [[third-wave ska]] in the 1990s, and \"[[Don't Speak]]\", the third single from the album, set a record when it spent 16 weeks at the number one spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart. \"[[Just a Girl]]\", co-written by Stefani, was described as \"the most popular cut on the CD\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Goulding |first1=Susan Christian |title=Orange Coast Magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4v0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24 |accessdate=19 July 2019 |date=1996}}</ref>\n\nThe group's next album, ''[[Return of Saturn]]'' (2000), despite its Top 40 hit single \"[[Simple Kind of Life]]\", did not match the success of their previous album, but received critical praise and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] at the [[2001 Grammy Awards|43rd Grammy Awards]]. Fifteen months later, the band reappeared with the album ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'' (2001), which incorporated [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] music into their work. The album was primarily recorded in [[Jamaica]] and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists [[Bounty Killer]], [[Sly and Robbie]], and [[Lady Saw]]. The album produced two [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning singles, \"[[Hey Baby (No Doubt song)|Hey Baby]]\" and \"[[Underneath It All]]\". \"[[Hella Good]]\" was also nominated for a Grammy award. On November 22, 2002, No Doubt received the Key to the City of Anaheim, given by the Mayor of Anaheim, Tom Daly, in [[Disneyland]] during the band's appearance on 'Breakfast with Kevin and Bean' ([[KROQ-FM]]) where they performed five songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nodoubt.com/blog/default.aspx?nid=3331&cmnt=1 |title=News : No Doubt To Receive Key To The City Of Anaheim |publisher=No Doubt |date= |accessdate=2011-07-07}}</ref> After a 2004 tour the band embarked on solo projects, with Stefani releasing two successful solo albums ''[[Love.

In 2008, the band resumed working slowly on their sixth effort, titled ''[[Push and Shove (album)|Push and Shove]]'' (2012), and released their single \"[[Settle Down (No Doubt song)|Settle Down]]\".

They practiced in Eric's parents' garage.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[Tony Kanal]] went to one of the band's early shows, and soon joined the band as its bassist.

The individual band member avatars could be made to perform solo, without their band members, as well as with members of other groups.\" The court then ruled that Activision's [[First Amendment to the

The band consists of vocalist [[Gwen Stefani]], guitarist [[Tom Dumont]], bassist [[Tony Kanal]], and drummer [[Adrian Young]]. Since the mid-1990s, they have been supported by trombonist [[Gabrial McNair]] and trumpeter [[Stephen Bradley (musician)|Stephen Bradley]] in live performances.\n\nThough their [[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|1992 eponymous debut album]] failed to make an impact, its [[ska punk]] inspired follow-up ''[[The Beacon Street Collection]]'' sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, over three times as many as its predecessor. The band's [[RIAA certification|diamond-certified]] album ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]'' (1995) benefited from the resurgence of [[third-wave ska]] in the 1990s, and \"[[Don't Speak]]\", the third single from the album, set a record when it spent 16 weeks at the number one spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart. \"[[Just a Girl]]\", co-written by Stefani, was described as \"the most popular cut on the CD\".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Goulding |first1=Susan Christian |title=Orange Coast Magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4v0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24 |accessdate=19 July 2019 |date=1996}}</ref>\n\nThe group's next album, ''[[Return of Saturn]]'' (2000), despite its Top 40 hit single \"[[Simple Kind of Life]]\", did not match the success of their previous album, but received critical praise and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] at the [[2001 Grammy Awards|43rd Grammy Awards]]. Fifteen months later, the band reappeared with the album ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'' (2001), which incorporated [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] music into their work. The album was primarily recorded in [[Jamaica]] and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists [[Bounty Killer]], [[Sly and Robbie]], and [[Lady Saw]]. The album produced two [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning singles, \"[[Hey Baby (No Doubt song)|Hey Baby]]\" and \"[[Underneath It All]]\". \"[[Hella Good]]\" was also nominated for a Grammy award. On November 22, 2002, No Doubt received the Key to the City of Anaheim, given by the Mayor of Anaheim, Tom Daly, in [[Disneyland]] during the band's appearance on 'Breakfast with Kevin and Bean' ([[KROQ-FM]]) where they performed five songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nodoubt.com/blog/default.aspx?nid=3331&cmnt=1 |title=News : No Doubt To Receive Key To The City Of Anaheim |publisher=No Doubt |date= |accessdate=2011-07-07}}</ref> After a 2004 tour the band embarked on solo projects, with Stefani releasing two successful solo albums ''[[Love. Angel. Music. Baby.]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Sweet Escape]]'' (2006) while Tom Dumont released his own solo music project, ''[[Invincible Overlord]]''. In 2008, the band resumed working slowly on their sixth effort, titled ''[[Push and Shove (album)|Push and Shove]]'' (2012), and released their single \"[[Settle Down (No Doubt song)|Settle Down]]\". They have sold over 33 million records worldwide.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (1986\u20131989)===\n[[Eric Stefani]] and [[John Spence (musician)|John Spence]] met at a [[Dairy Queen]], and talked about getting a group together to play music. Stefani acquired a keyboard and gathered some players together to practice; these included himself (keyboards), his sister [[Gwen Stefani]] (backing vocals), John Spence (lead vocals), Jerry McMahon (guitar), Chris Leal (bass), Chris Webb (drums), Gabriel Gonzalez & [[Starpool|Alan Meade]] (trumpet), and Tony Meade (saxophone). They practiced in Eric's parents' garage.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[Tony Kanal]] went to one of the band's early shows, and soon joined the band as its bassist. After initially rejecting her advances, he began dating Gwen, but they kept their relationship secret for a year, feeling that it was an unspoken rule that no one in the band date her.<ref name=\"btm\">\"No Doubt\".

Eric Carpenter (saxophone) joined the horn section soon after.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The group performed at an Orange High School backyard graduation party on June 6, 1987 with two other California ska bands. At the party, No Doubt's set included \"Total Hate\", \"Too Much Pressure\", \"Gangsters\", and the song \"No Doubt\". Video clips from the party have appeared on VH1's ''[[Behind the Music]]''.\n\nIn December 1987, Spence ended his life, several days before the band was to play a gig at [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|The Roxy Theatre]] for [[record industry]] employees.<ref name=\"btm\"/> No Doubt disbanded but decided to regroup after several weeks<ref name=\"btm\"/> with Alan Meade taking over vocals.<ref name=\"ocw\">{{cite web |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/1998-03-05/music/tunes-and-toons/full/ |title=Tunes and 'Toons |work=[[OC Weekly]] |publisher=[[Village Voice Media]] |date=February 26, 1998 |accessdate=April 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217225009/http://www.ocweekly.com/1998-03-05/music/tunes-and-toons/full/ |archive-date=December 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> When Meade left the band, Gwen replaced him as lead singer,<ref name=\"ocw\"/> and No Doubt continued to develop a live following in California.<ref name=\"btm\"/> In early 1988, [[Tom Dumont]] left Rising, a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band of which he was a member with his sister,<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nodoubt.com/band/ |title=\"Timeline\".
