The proposal was not approved to due to concerns over national security and negative cultural influence. In 1997, the [[Government of India]] banned DTH services when [[Rupert Murdoch]]-owned Indian Sky Broadcasting (ISkyB) was about to launch its DTH services in the country.<ref name=\"Rediff1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2004/mar/23spec.htm|title=What is DTH?|website=www.rediff.com|access-date=2016-10-01}}</ref> After deliberations among groups of ministers, DTH services were permitted by the [[Third Vajpayee ministry|NDA government]] in November 2000. The ministers made four key recommendations to govern DTH services: no single entity, either private or state-owned, should be permitted a [[monopoly]] in DTH services; the [[vertical integration]] of DTH and [[cable television]] services should be monitored in order to prevent the formation of a monopoly in television distribution; the vertical integration of DTH operators and television channels should be avoided in order to ensure fair competition among TV channels.\n\nThe new policy announced in November 2000 required all DTH operators to set up earth stations in India within 12 months of receiving a license. DTH licenses were priced at $2.14 million with a validity of 10 years. The FDI limit in the DTH sector was capped at 49%, and the company operating the services was required to be headed by an Indian citizen.<ref name=\"Rediff1\"/>\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe first DTH service was launched in India on 2 October 2003 by [[Dish TV]] owned by [[Zee Entertainment Enterprises|Zee]]. The company decided not to compete against entrenched cable operators in metros and urban areas, and instead focused on providing services to rural areas and regions not serviced by cable television.

The ministers made four key recommendations to govern DTH services: no single entity, either private or state-owned, should be permitted a [[monopoly]] in DTH services; the [[vertical integration]] of DTH and [[cable television]] services should be monitored in order to prevent the formation of a monopoly in television distribution; the vertical integration of DTH operators and television channels should be avoided in order to ensure fair competition among TV channels.\n\nThe new policy announced in November 2000 required all DTH operators to set up earth stations in India within 12 months of receiving a license. DTH licenses were priced at $2.14 million with a validity of 10 years. The FDI limit in the DTH sector was capped at 49%, and the company operating the services was required to be headed by an Indian citizen.<ref name=\"Rediff1\"/>\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe first DTH service was launched in India on 2 October 2003 by [[Dish TV]] owned by [[Zee Entertainment Enterprises|Zee]].

{"title_page": "Scooter (motorcycle)", "text_new": "{{For|similar terms|Scooter (disambiguation)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Red scooter rider Avenida Do Mar, Funchal, Madeira Island.jpg|upright=1.14|thumb|The [[Vespa]] was the first globally popular scooter ]]\n\nA '''scooter''' or '''motor scooter''' is a type of [[motorcycle]] with a [[step-through frame]] and a platform for the rider's feet. Elements of scooter design were present in some of the earliest motorcycles, and scooters have been made since at least 1914. Scooter development continued in Europe and the United States [[Interwar period|between the World Wars]].\n\nThe global popularity of motor scooters dates from the post-World War II introductions of the [[Vespa]] and [[Lambretta]] models in Italy. These scooters were intended to provide economical personal transportation ([[engine]]s from {{convert|50|to|250|cc|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The original layout is still widely used in this application. Maxi-scooters, with larger engines from {{convert|250|to|850|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} have been developed for Western markets.\n\nScooters are popular for personal transportation partly due to being more affordable, easier to operate, and more convenient to park and store than a car. Licensing requirements for scooters are easier and cheaper than for cars in most parts of the world, and insurance is usually cheaper. The term motor scooter is sometimes used to avoid confusion with [[kick scooter]], but can then be confused with [[motorized scooter]]s, another distinct kind of scooter.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines a motor scooter is a motorcycle similar to a [[kick scooter]] with a seat, a floorboard, and small or low wheels.<ref name=ScooterDefinition/> The [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transportation]] defines a scooter as a motorcycle that has a platform for the operator's feet or has integrated footrests, and has a step-through architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?section=571.123  |title=DOT Regulation Part 571.123: Standard No. 123; Motorcycle controls and displays. |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>\n\nThe classic scooter design features a step-through frame and a flat floorboard for the rider's feet.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} This design is possible because most scooter engines and drive systems are attached to the rear axle or under the seat. Unlike a conventional motorcycle, in which the engine is mounted on the frame, most modern scooters allow the engine to swing with the rear wheel, while most vintage scooters and some newer [[retro]] models have an axle-mounted engine. Modern scooters starting from late-1980s generally use a [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT), while older ones use a manual transmission with the gearshift and clutch control built into the left handlebar.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nScooters usually feature bodywork, including a front leg shield and body that conceals all or most of the mechanicals. There is often some integral storage space, either under the seat, built into the front leg shield, or both. Scooters have varying engine displacements and configurations ranging from 50&nbsp;cc single-cylinder to 850&nbsp;cc twin-cylinder models.\n\nTraditionally, scooter wheels are smaller than conventional motorcycle wheels and are made of pressed steel or cast aluminum alloy, bolt on easily, and often are interchangeable between front and rear. Some scooters carry a [[spare wheel]]. Many recent scooters use conventional [[Motorcycle fork|front forks]] with the front axle fastened at both ends.\n\n== Regulatory classification ==\n\nMost jurisdictions do not differentiate between scooters and motorcycles. For all legal purposes in the United States of America, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) recommends using the term motorcycle for all of these vehicles. However, while NHTSA excludes the term ''motor scooter'' from legal definition, it proceeds, in the same document, to give detailed instructions on how to import a small motor scooter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import/FAQ%20Site/pages/page3.html#Anchor-52644   |title=Importation and Certification FAQ's Directory-Motorcycles and Scooters |publisher=Nhtsa.dot.gov   |accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref>\n\n===California===\n{{As of|2020}} the US state of California has a highly complex regulatory system for 2- and 3-wheeled vehicles.  It classifies vehicles with fewer than four wheels into the following categories:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myronsmopeds.com/category/california-vehicle-codes/|title=California Vehicle Codes|work=Myron's Mopeds}}</ref>\n* Motorcycle: a motorcycle is any 2- or 3-wheeled gas operated vehicle weighing under 1,500 lbs. with an engine displacement greater than or equal to 150ccs.  Operation requires an M1 class license, and such vehicles must be registered with the state and carry mandatory insurance as well as bear a motorcycle license plate.  Motorcycles may travel on any public roadway, including freeways, and may carry a single passenger in addition to the driver.  Helmets are mandatory.\n* Motor-driven cycle: a motor-driven cycle is 2-wheeled gas operated vehicle with an engine displacement of 149ccs or less that does not qualify as a moped (see below) and is capable of traveling greater than 30mph.  It has the same licensing, registration, insurance, license plating, and helmet requirements as a motorcycle, though it may not travel on freewways.  Such vehicles are commonly referred to as \"scooters\".\n* Moped: a moped (or \"motorized bicycle\") is a 2- or 3-wheeled device with an automatic transmission capable of traveling no more than 30mph, with either a gas engine displacement of less than 50ccs (i.e., 49ccs or less) ''with'' built-in pedals like a bicycle for human operation, OR, if powered only by electricity, it must not produce more than four gross [[brake horsepower]] (bicycle pedals are optional for electric mopeds).  There are no registration or insurance requirements for the device, but the operator him- or herself must have an M1 or M2 class license and must personally carry the minimum state automobile insurance and the moped itself must bear a special moped license plate. A single passenger is permitted if the vehicle is fitted with a specific seat and footrests for same.\n*Motorized tricycle/ quadricycie: a motorized tricycle or quadricycle is a 3- or 4-wheeled vehicle propelled by a gas motor not capable of traveling greater than 30mph and with a gross brake horsepower of 2 or less.\n* Motorized scooter: a motorized scooter is a 2-wheeled vehicle not capable of traveling greater than 15mph with a floorboard designed to be stood upon while operating.  They do not require a license plate or insurance, and may not be driven on a roadway with a posted speed limit greater than 25mph.  A valid class C driver license is required, as is a bicycle helmet.  Passenger are prohibited.  They may be operated on a bikepath or bikeway but not on a sidewalk.  If a given roadway has a bicycle lane, the motorized scooter must travel within it, and can only make a left-hand turn by dismounting and crossing an intersection as a pedestrian.\n* Electric bicycle: California recognizes three classes of electric bicycle.  A class 1 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose electric motor only provides assistance to the rider when using the pedals and stops assisting when the bicycle reaches 20mph; a class 2 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose motor can drive the bicycle entirely on its own, but will not assist the rider above 20mph; a class 3 electric bicycle is identical to a class 1 electric bicycle, but is capable of traveling up 28mph before the engine stops assisting the rider AND is equipped with a speedometer.  No electric bicycle requires insurance, a license, or any form of registration or license plate as it is not considered a \"motor vehicle\" by the state.\n\n== Emissions ==\n{{See also|Fuel gas-powered scooter}}\nThe [[vehicle emissions control|emissions]] of [[moped]]s and scooters have been the subject of multiple studies. Studies have found that [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] 50&nbsp;[[Cubic centimetre|cc]] mopeds, with and without catalytic converters, emit ten to thirty times more hydrocarbons and particulate emissions than the outdated [[European emission standards|Euro 3]] automobile standards.<ref name=\"eri.ucr.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eri.ucr.edu/ISAFXVCD/ISAFXVAF/EmMPFAM.pdf|work=Schramm et al.|title=Emissions from a Moped Fuelled by Gasoline/Ethanol Mixtures|accessdate=2010-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=1|pages=505\u2013512|title=Chemical characterization of emissions from modern two-stroke mopeds complying with legislative regulation in Europe (EURO-2)|doi=10.1021/es9021969|pmid=19928903|year = 2010|last1 = Adam|first1 = T.|last2=Farfaletti|first2=A.|last3=Montero|first3=L.|last4=Martini|first4=G.|last5=Manfredi|first5=U.|last6=Larsen|first6=B.|last7=Santi|first7=G.

In 1894, [[Hildebrand & Wolfm\u00fcller]] in [[Munich]], Germany produced the first motorcycle that was available for purchase. Their motorcycle had a step-through frame, with its fuel tank mounted on the down tube, its parallel two-cylinder engine mounted low on the frame, and its cylinders mounted in line with the frame. It was water-cooled and had a [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] built into the top of the rear fender. It became the first mass-produced and publicly sold powered two-wheel vehicle, and among the first powered mainly by its engine rather than foot pedals. Maximum speed was {{convert|40|kph|abbr=on}}. The rear wheel was driven directly by rods from the pistons in a manner similar to the drive wheels of [[steam locomotive]]s. Only a few hundred such bikes were built, and the high price and technical difficulties made the venture a financial failure for both Wolfm\u00fcller and his financial backer, Hildebrand.<ref name=\"WoM_HuW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.khulsey.com/motorcycles/vintage_motorcycle_hildebrand_wolfmueller.html|title=The World of Motorcycles: Vintage Motorcycles - Hildebrand & Wolfm\u00fcller|publisher=Kevin Hulsey Illustration, Inc.|website=theworldofmotorcycles.com|accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn France, the [[Auto-Fauteuil]] was introduced in 1902.

D'Ascanio's {{convert|98|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} scooter had various new design concepts, including a stress-bearing structure. The [[gear shift]] lever was moved to the handlebars for easier riding. The engine was placed near the rear wheel, eliminating the [[belt drive]]. The typical fork support was replaced by an arm similar to an aircraft carriage for easier tire-changing. The body design protected the driver from wind and road dirt. The smaller wheels and shorter wheelbase provide improved maneuverability through narrow streets and congested traffic. The name originated when Piaggio's president, upon seeing the prototype, remarked ''\"Sembra una vespa\"'', \"It looks like a wasp\".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMonths after the Vespa, in 1947, [[Innocenti]] introduced the [[Lambretta (motorscooter)|Lambretta]], beginning a rivalry with Vespa.

Honda's [[Honda PS250|PS250]] (also known as Big Ruckus) features a motorcycle-like exoskeleton instead of bodywork.\n\nA new direction in maxi-scooters has the engine fixed to the frame. This arrangement improves handling by allowing bigger wheels and less unsprung weight, also tending to move the centre of gravity forwards. The trend toward larger, more powerful scooters with fully automatic transmissions converges with an emerging trend in motorcycle design that foreshadows automatic transmission motorcycles with on-board storage. Examples include the [[Aprilia Mana 850]] automatic-transmission motorcycle and the [[Honda NC700D Integra]], which is a scooter built on a motorcycle platform.\n\n===Enclosed scooter===\n{{Main|Cabin motorcycle}}\n\nSome scooters, including the [[BMW C1]] and the [[Honda Gyro|Honda Gyro Canopy]], have a windscreen and a roof.

Some examples are: the [[ENV]] from Intelligent Energy, [[Honda]]'s scooter using the Honda FC Stack, and the Yamaha FC-AQEL. Also, petroleum hybrid-electric motorcycles are available.

This has a slanted downtube, which defines an underbone, and no foot platform, the presence of which defines a scooter.]]\n\nAn [[underbone]] is a motorcycle built on a chassis consisting mostly of a single large diameter tube. An underbone differs from a conventional motorcycle mainly by not having a structural member connecting the [[head stock]] to the structure under the front of the seat and by not having a fuel tank or similarly styled appendage in the space between the riders knees. Underbones are commonly referred to as \"step-throughs\" and appeal to both genders in much the same way as scooters.\n\nUnderbones are often mistaken for scooters and are sometimes marketed as such. However, an underbone does not have a footboard, and is therefore not a scooter.\n\nThe engine of an underbone is usually fixed to the chassis under the downtube, while a scooter usually has its engine mounted on its [[swingarm]]. As a result, underbone engines are usually further forwards than those of scooters. A typical underbone therefore has a more central [[center of mass|centre of gravity]] than a typical scooter. Furthermore, having an engine mounted on the swingarm gives a typical scooter more [[unsprung mass]] than a typical underbone. These factors give a typical underbone better handling than a typical scooter.\n\nThe engine of an underbone typically drives the rear wheel by a chain of the kind used on a conventional motorcycle. This final drive is often concealed by a chain enclosure to keep the chain clean and reduce wear. The final drive of a scooter with a swingarm-mounted engine runs in a sealed oil bath and is shorter.\n\nAn underbone is usually fitted with near full-size motorcycle wheels, which are often spoked. Scooter wheels are usually small, and made from pressed steel. In both cases, more recent examples often have cast alloy wheels. The bigger wheels of an underbone allow more ventilation and better cooling for the brakes than the smaller wheels of a scooter.\n\nWhile the engine and suspension layouts described here for scooters and underbones are typical, they are not rigid definitions. There have been scooters with fixed engines and chain drive, and there have been underbones with swingarm-mounted engines. A twenty-first century example of variance from the typical scooter layout is the [[Suzuki Choinori]], which had both its engine and its rear axle rigidly bolted to its frame.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Some atypical scooters and underbones\">\nFile:Heinkel Tourist 103 A0, Bj. 1956.jpg|1956 Heinkel Tourist.

In Thailand, scooters are used for street to door taxi services, as well as for navigating through heavy traffic. The extensive range of cycle tracks in the Netherlands extends into parts of Belgium and Germany and is open to all small powered two-wheelers. Motor scooters are popular because of their size, [[fuel efficiency|fuel-efficiency]], weight, and typically larger storage room than a motorcycle.

Scooters had provided inexpensive transportation for decades before the development of the mod subculture, but the mods stood out in the way that they treated the vehicle as a fashion accessory, expressed through clubs such as the [[Ace of Herts]]. Italian scooters were preferred for their cleanlined, curving shapes and gleaming [[chrome plating|chrome]].

Engine side panels and front bumpers were taken to local electroplating workshops and plated with highly reflective chrome.\n\nScooters were also a practical and accessible form of transportation for 1960s teens. In the early 1960s, [[public transport]] stopped relatively early in the night, and so having scooters allowed mods to stay out all night at dance clubs. To keep their expensive suits clean and keep warm while riding, mods often wore long army parkas. For teens with low-end jobs, scooters were cheaper than cars, and they could be bought on a payment plan through newly available [[hire purchase]] plans. After a law was passed requiring at least one mirror be attached to every motorcycle, mods were known to add four, ten, or as many as 30 mirrors to their scooters.

Elements of scooter design were present in some of the earliest motorcycles, and scooters have been made since at least 1914. Scooter development continued in Europe and the United States [[Interwar period|between the World Wars]].\n\nThe global popularity of motor scooters dates from the post-World War II introductions of the [[Vespa]] and [[Lambretta]] models in Italy. These scooters were intended to provide economical personal transportation ([[engine]]s from {{convert|50|to|250|cc|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The original layout is still widely used in this application. Maxi-scooters, with larger engines from {{convert|250|to|850|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} have been developed for Western markets.\n\nScooters are popular for personal transportation partly due to being more affordable, easier to operate, and more convenient to park and store than a car. Licensing requirements for scooters are easier and cheaper than for cars in most parts of the world, and insurance is usually cheaper. The term motor scooter is sometimes used to avoid confusion with [[kick scooter]], but can then be confused with [[motorized scooter]]s, another distinct kind of scooter.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines a motor scooter is a motorcycle similar to a [[kick scooter]] with a seat, a floorboard, and small or low wheels.<ref name=ScooterDefinition/> The [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transportation]] defines a scooter as a motorcycle that has a platform for the operator's feet or has integrated footrests, and has a step-through architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?section=571.123  |title=DOT Regulation Part 571.123: Standard No. 123; Motorcycle controls and displays. |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>\n\nThe classic scooter design features a step-through frame and a flat floorboard for the rider's feet.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} This design is possible because most scooter engines and drive systems are attached to the rear axle or under the seat. Unlike a conventional motorcycle, in which the engine is mounted on the frame, most modern scooters allow the engine to swing with the rear wheel, while most vintage scooters and some newer [[retro]] models have an axle-mounted engine. Modern scooters starting from late-1980s generally use a [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT), while older ones use a manual transmission with the gearshift and clutch control built into the left handlebar.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nScooters usually feature bodywork, including a front leg shield and body that conceals all or most of the mechanicals. There is often some integral storage space, either under the seat, built into the front leg shield, or both. Scooters have varying engine displacements and configurations ranging from 50&nbsp;cc single-cylinder to 850&nbsp;cc twin-cylinder models.\n\nTraditionally, scooter wheels are smaller than conventional motorcycle wheels and are made of pressed steel or cast aluminum alloy, bolt on easily, and often are interchangeable between front and rear. Some scooters carry a [[spare wheel]]. Many recent scooters use conventional [[Motorcycle fork|front forks]] with the front axle fastened at both ends.\n\n== Regulatory classification ==\n\nMost jurisdictions do not differentiate between scooters and motorcycles. For all legal purposes in the United States of America, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) recommends using the term motorcycle for all of these vehicles. However, while NHTSA excludes the term ''motor scooter'' from legal definition, it proceeds, in the same document, to give detailed instructions on how to import a small motor scooter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import/FAQ%20Site/pages/page3.html#Anchor-52644   |title=Importation and Certification FAQ's Directory-Motorcycles and Scooters |publisher=Nhtsa.dot.gov   |accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref>\n\n===California===\n{{As of|2020}} the US state of California has a highly complex regulatory system for 2- and 3-wheeled vehicles.  It classifies vehicles with fewer than four wheels into the following categories:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myronsmopeds.com/category/california-vehicle-codes/|title=California Vehicle Codes|work=Myron's Mopeds}}</ref>\n* Motorcycle: a motorcycle is any 2- or 3-wheeled gas operated vehicle weighing under 1,500 lbs. with an engine displacement greater than or equal to 150ccs.  Operation requires an M1 class license, and such vehicles must be registered with the state and carry mandatory insurance as well as bear a motorcycle license plate.  Motorcycles may travel on any public roadway, including freeways, and may carry a single passenger in addition to the driver.  Helmets are mandatory.\n* Motor-driven cycle: a motor-driven cycle is 2-wheeled gas operated vehicle with an engine displacement of 149ccs or less that does not qualify as a moped (see below) and is capable of traveling greater than 30mph.  It has the same licensing, registration, insurance, license plating, and helmet requirements as a motorcycle, though it may not travel on freewways.  Such vehicles are commonly referred to as \"scooters\".\n* Moped: a moped (or \"motorized bicycle\") is a 2- or 3-wheeled device with an automatic transmission capable of traveling no more than 30mph, with either a gas engine displacement of less than 50ccs (i.e., 49ccs or less) ''with'' built-in pedals like a bicycle for human operation, OR, if powered only by electricity, it must not produce more than four gross [[brake horsepower]] (bicycle pedals are optional for electric mopeds).  There are no registration or insurance requirements for the device, but the operator him- or herself must have an M1 or M2 class license and must personally carry the minimum state automobile insurance and the moped itself must bear a special moped license plate. A single passenger is permitted if the vehicle is fitted with a specific seat and footrests for same.\n*Motorized tricycle/ quadricycie: a motorized tricycle or quadricycle is a 3- or 4-wheeled vehicle propelled by a gas motor not capable of traveling greater than 30mph and with a gross brake horsepower of 2 or less.\n* Motorized scooter: a motorized scooter is a 2-wheeled vehicle not capable of traveling greater than 15mph with a floorboard designed to be stood upon while operating.  They do not require a license plate or insurance, and may not be driven on a roadway with a posted speed limit greater than 25mph.  A valid class C driver license is required, as is a bicycle helmet.  Passenger are prohibited.  They may be operated on a bikepath or bikeway but not on a sidewalk.  If a given roadway has a bicycle lane, the motorized scooter must travel within it, and can only make a left-hand turn by dismounting and crossing an intersection as a pedestrian.\n* Electric bicycle: California recognizes three classes of electric bicycle.  A class 1 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose electric motor only provides assistance to the rider when using the pedals and stops assisting when the bicycle reaches 20mph; a class 2 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose motor can drive the bicycle entirely on its own, but will not assist the rider above 20mph; a class 3 electric bicycle is identical to a class 1 electric bicycle, but is capable of traveling up 28mph before the engine stops assisting the rider AND is equipped with a speedometer.  No electric bicycle requires insurance, a license, or any form of registration or license plate as it is not considered a \"motor vehicle\" by the state.\n\n== Emissions ==\n{{See also|Fuel gas-powered scooter}}\nThe [[vehicle emissions control|emissions]] of [[moped]]s and scooters have been the subject of multiple studies.

Their motorcycle had a step-through frame, with its fuel tank mounted on the down tube, its parallel two-cylinder engine mounted low on the frame, and its cylinders mounted in line with the frame. It was water-cooled and had a [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] built into the top of the rear fender. It became the first mass-produced and publicly sold powered two-wheel vehicle, and among the first powered mainly by its engine rather than foot pedals. Maximum speed was {{convert|40|kph|abbr=on}}. The rear wheel was driven directly by rods from the pistons in a manner similar to the drive wheels of [[steam locomotive]]s.

D'Ascanio's {{convert|98|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} scooter had various new design concepts, including a stress-bearing structure. The [[gear shift]] lever was moved to the handlebars for easier riding. The engine was placed near the rear wheel, eliminating the [[belt drive]]. The typical fork support was replaced by an arm similar to an aircraft carriage for easier tire-changing. The body design protected the driver from wind and road dirt. The smaller wheels and shorter wheelbase provide improved maneuverability through narrow streets and congested traffic.

Honda's [[Honda PS250|PS250]] (also known as Big Ruckus) features a motorcycle-like exoskeleton instead of bodywork.\n\nA new direction in maxi-scooters has the engine fixed to the frame. This arrangement improves handling by allowing bigger wheels and less unsprung weight, also tending to move the centre of gravity forwards. The trend toward larger, more powerful scooters with fully automatic transmissions converges with an emerging trend in motorcycle design that foreshadows automatic transmission motorcycles with on-board storage.

This has a slanted downtube, which defines an underbone, and no foot platform, the presence of which defines a scooter.]]\n\nAn [[underbone]] is a motorcycle built on a chassis consisting mostly of a single large diameter tube. An underbone differs from a conventional motorcycle mainly by not having a structural member connecting the [[head stock]] to the structure under the front of the seat and by not having a fuel tank or similarly styled appendage in the space between the riders knees. Underbones are commonly referred to as \"step-throughs\" and appeal to both genders in much the same way as scooters.\n\nUnderbones are often mistaken for scooters and are sometimes marketed as such. However, an underbone does not have a footboard, and is therefore not a scooter.\n\nThe engine of an underbone is usually fixed to the chassis under the downtube, while a scooter usually has its engine mounted on its [[swingarm]]. As a result, underbone engines are usually further forwards than those of scooters. A typical underbone therefore has a more central [[center of mass|centre of gravity]] than a typical scooter. Furthermore, having an engine mounted on the swingarm gives a typical scooter more [[unsprung mass]] than a typical underbone. These factors give a typical underbone better handling than a typical scooter.\n\nThe engine of an underbone typically drives the rear wheel by a chain of the kind used on a conventional motorcycle. This final drive is often concealed by a chain enclosure to keep the chain clean and reduce wear. The final drive of a scooter with a swingarm-mounted engine runs in a sealed oil bath and is shorter.\n\nAn underbone is usually fitted with near full-size motorcycle wheels, which are often spoked. Scooter wheels are usually small, and made from pressed steel. In both cases, more recent examples often have cast alloy wheels. The bigger wheels of an underbone allow more ventilation and better cooling for the brakes than the smaller wheels of a scooter.\n\nWhile the engine and suspension layouts described here for scooters and underbones are typical, they are not rigid definitions. There have been scooters with fixed engines and chain drive, and there have been underbones with swingarm-mounted engines. A twenty-first century example of variance from the typical scooter layout is the [[Suzuki Choinori]], which had both its engine and its rear axle rigidly bolted to its frame.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Some atypical scooters and underbones\">\nFile:Heinkel Tourist 103 A0, Bj. 1956.jpg|1956 Heinkel Tourist.

In Thailand, scooters are used for street to door taxi services, as well as for navigating through heavy traffic. The extensive range of cycle tracks in the Netherlands extends into parts of Belgium and Germany and is open to all small powered two-wheelers. Motor scooters are popular because of their size, [[fuel efficiency|fuel-efficiency]], weight, and typically larger storage room than a motorcycle. In many localities, certain road motor scooters are considered by law to be in the same class as mopeds or small motorcycles and therefore they have fewer restrictions than do larger motorcycles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nAccording to the [[Motorcycle Industry Council]], sales of motor scooters in the United States have more than doubled since 2000.

Scooters had provided inexpensive transportation for decades before the development of the mod subculture, but the mods stood out in the way that they treated the vehicle as a fashion accessory, expressed through clubs such as the [[Ace of Herts]]. Italian scooters were preferred for their cleanlined, curving shapes and gleaming [[chrome plating|chrome]]. For young mods, Italian scooters were the \"embodiment of continental style and a way to escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing\".<ref name=\"straight.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/article/vespa-scoots-sexily-back-to-vancouver|title=Vespa Scoots Sexily Back to Vancouver|last=Sarti|first=Doug|date=June 3, 2004|publisher=Vancouver Free Press|location=Vancouver, Canada|quote=The scooter, to them, was the embodiment of continental style and a way to escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing.|work=straight.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522112423/http://www.straight.com/article/vespa-scoots-sexily-back-to-vancouver|archivedate=2011-05-22|url-status=live|accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref> They customized their scooters by painting them in \"two-tone and candyflake and overaccessorized [them] with luggage racks, crash bars, and scores of mirrors and fog lights\",<ref name=\"straight.com\"/> and they often put their names on the small windscreen. Engine side panels and front bumpers were taken to local electroplating workshops and plated with highly reflective chrome.\n\nScooters were also a practical and accessible form of transportation for 1960s teens. In the early 1960s, [[public transport]] stopped relatively early in the night, and so having scooters allowed mods to stay out all night at dance clubs. To keep their expensive suits clean and keep warm while riding, mods often wore long army parkas. For teens with low-end jobs, scooters were cheaper than cars, and they could be bought on a payment plan through newly available [[hire purchase]] plans. After a law was passed requiring at least one mirror be attached to every motorcycle, mods were known to add four, ten, or as many as 30 mirrors to their scooters. The cover of [[The Who]]'s album ''[[Quadrophenia]]'', which includes themes related to mods and [[Rocker (subculture)|rockers]], depicts a young man on a Vespa GS with four mirrors attached.<ref>{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Pete|title=Quadrophenia|year=1973|publisher=Fabulous Music Ltd., 1973|location=London|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7r3PSgAACAAJ&dq=quadrophenia}}</ref> The album spawned a [[Quadrophenia (film)|1979 motion picture of the same name]].\n\n[[Scooterboy]] magazines include the British monthly magazine ''[[Scootering (British magazine)|Scootering]]''<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gillard|first1=Andy|first2=Gareth |last2=Brown |author3=Stuart Lanning |title=Scootering |journal=Scootering |year=1986 |url=http://www.mortonsmediagroup.com/media/sco.asp#ratecardia}}</ref> \nand the American quarterly magazine ''Scoot!''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Whitney |first1=April |first2=Josh |last2=Rogers |first3=Mike |last3=Zorn |first4=Casey |last4=Earls |first5=Barry |last5=Synoground |journal=Scoot! |year=1995|url=http://www.scootmagazine.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517035608/http://www.scootmagazine.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-05-17 |title= Scoot!}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Auto rickshaw]]\n* [[Cutdown]]\n* [[List of scooter manufacturers]]\n* [[List of scooters]]\n* [[Fuel gas-powered scooter#Conversion kits for petrol scooters|Fuel conversion kits for scooters]]\n* [[Mobility scooter]]\n* [[Segway PT]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{-}}\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=ScooterDefinition>Various scooter definitions:\n* {{cite book |title= The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary |edition= third |year= 1968 |origyear= 1956 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford, UK |pages= 1808\u201309|quote='''3.'''

It was established on July 25, 1797 by the [[Franciscan]] order, on a site chosen specifically due to the large number of [[Salinan Indians]] that inhabited the area, whom the Spanish priests wanted to evangelize.\n\nThe mission remains in use as a parish church of the [[Diocese of Monterey]]. After being closed to the public for six years due to the [[2003 San Simeon earthquake]], the church reopened on September 29, 2009.

From 1816 to 1818 a new church was constructed with a tile roof and courtyard.\n\nMission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel land sold off after the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833]]. The William Reed family lived in the buildings until 1848, when they were murdered by a band of thieves . The killers were tracked down by a posse of vigilantes in the foothills of Santa Barbara. Two thieves died in the ensuing battle, and the other three were tried and executed by firing squad.<ref>[http://www.missionsanmiguel.com/history/reedfamily.html missionsanmiguel.com Mission San Miguel Reed family History]</ref> Then the mission was closed and decay started.

But with the buildings all in ruins, no priests were assigned to the return mission. Parts were rented to some small businesses. In 1878 the Church reactivated the mission and priests were again living at the mission.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factcards.califa.org/mis/sanmiguelarcangel.html|title=California Missions|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"250px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:MissionSanMiguelPlaza2008.JPG|<center>Mission plaza</center>\nFile:Ojo.jpg|<center>Ojo de Dios, above altar</center>\nFile:Mission San Miguel, California - Interior.jpg|<center>Interior of the church</center>\nFile:Belltower at San Miguel Arcangel.jpg|Adobe wall and bell tower at Mission San Miguel Arcangel\nFile:Fountain at Mission San Miguel.jpg|<center>Fountain in plaza</center>\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spanish missions in California]]\n* [[USNS Mission San Miguel (AO-129)|USNS ''Mission San Miguel'' (AO-129)]] \u2013 a [[USNS Mission Buenaventura (AO\u2011111)|''Buenaventura]] Class [[Oiler (ship)|fleet oiler]] built during [[World War II]].\n* [[Ygnacio Coronel]] (1795\u20131862).

ca.1904 (CHS-2245).jpg|thumb|Mission San Miguel Arcangel around 1906]]\n'''Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel''' is a [[Spanish missions in California|Spanish mission]] in [[San Miguel, San Luis Obispo County, California]]. It was established on July 25, 1797 by the [[Franciscan]] order, on a site chosen specifically due to the large number of [[Salinan Indians]] that inhabited the area, whom the Spanish priests wanted to evangelize.\n\nThe mission remains in use as a parish church of the [[Diocese of Monterey]]. After being closed to the public for six years due to the [[2003 San Simeon earthquake]], the church reopened on September 29, 2009. Inside the church are murals designed by [[Esteban Munras]].<ref name = nrhpinv>{{Cite web | last = Grimes | first = Theresa | title = Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel | work = National Register of Historic Places \u2013 Inventory Nomination Form| publisher = [[National Park Service]] | date = May 19, 2005 | url = {{NHLS url|id=71000191}}| format = pdf | accessdate = 22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe mission was put on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1971<ref name = nris/> and was named to a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2006.<ref name = nhlsum/>  Of California's missions, it is one that retains more than most of its layout and buildings, including a portion of its neophyte village.<ref name=nrhpinv/>\n\n==Features==\n* The Mission Arcade, a series of 12 arches, is original. The variety of shapes and sizes was planned<ref name=\"brochure\">{{cite journal|title=Mission San Miguel Arcangel The park brochure|date=n.d.}}</ref>  and the Mission was known for this arcade.\n* The first chapel on the site was replaced within a year of its construction by a larger adobe chapel, which burned in the 1806 fire.<ref name=\"brochure\"/>\n* The current mission church was built between 1816 and 1818. It is 144 long, {{convert|27|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|40|ft|m}} high.<ref name=\"brochure\"/>\n* The cemetery adjacent to the church holds the remains of 2,249 Native Americans listed in the Mission's burial records.<ref name=\"brochure\"/>\n* The painted walls inside the church are the original artwork by artist Esteban Munras and other [[Salinan]] artists.<ref name=\"brochure\"/>\n\n==Mission bells==\nBells were vitally important to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bells.\n\n==History==\nFather [[Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n]] and Father Buenaventura Sitjar founded the mission on July 25, 1797, making it the sixteenth [[California mission]]. Its location between [[Mission San Luis Obispo]] and [[Mission San Antonio de Padua]] provided a stop on the trip that had previously taken two days.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.missionsanmiguel.org/about|title=history|publisher=Mission San Miguel|access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref>\nA temporary wooden church was built with living quarters. The site was picked as it was close to a Salinan Indian village called Vahca.  In 1798 the small chapel was replaced. From 1816 to 1818 a new church was constructed with a tile roof and courtyard.\n\nMission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel land sold off after the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833]]. The William Reed family lived in the buildings until 1848, when they were murdered by a band of thieves . The killers were tracked down by a posse of vigilantes in the foothills of Santa Barbara, two thieves died in the ensuing battle, and the other 3 were tried and shot. Then the mission was closed and decay started. In 1841 the last Franciscan left San Miguel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missionsanmiguel.com/history/Lands_Padres.html|title=Mission San Miguel Property and Padres|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.missionsanmiguel.com/history/reedfamily.html missionsanmiguel.com Mission San Miguel Reed family History]</ref>\n\nIn 1859 the Mission was returned to the Catholic Church. But with the buildings all in ruins, no priests were assigned to the return mission. Parts were rented to some small businesses. In 1878 the Church reactivated the mission and priests were again living at the mission.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factcards.califa.org/mis/sanmiguelarcangel.html|title=California Missions|publisher=|accessdate=26 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"250px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:MissionSanMiguelPlaza2008.JPG|<center>Mission plaza</center>\nFile:Ojo.jpg|<center>Ojo de Dios, above altar</center>\nFile:Mission San Miguel, California - Interior.jpg|<center>Interior of the church</center>\nFile:Belltower at San Miguel Arcangel.jpg|Adobe wall and bell tower at Mission San Miguel Arcangel\nFile:Fountain at Mission San Miguel.jpg|<center>Fountain in plaza</center>\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spanish missions in California]]\n* [[USNS Mission San Miguel (AO-129)|USNS ''Mission San Miguel'' (AO-129)]] \u2013 a [[USNS Mission Buenaventura (AO\u2011111)|''Buenaventura]] Class [[Oiler (ship)|fleet oiler]] built during [[World War II]].\n* [[Ygnacio Coronel]] (1795\u20131862).

The novels are related from the [[first-person narrative|first-person]] perspective by Ellie Linton, a teenage girl, who is part of a small band of teenagers waging a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] war on the enemy soldiers in the region around their fictional home town of Wirrawee. The name of the series is derived from the title of the first book, ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]''.\n\nThe books in the series were originally published from 1993\u201399, by [[Pan Macmillan]] and have been reprinted sixteen times. A sequel series, ''The Ellie Chronicles'', was later published from 2003\u201306. The follow-up series concerns itself largely with the attempts of society and the protagonist to regain a normal level of functioning in the face of the psychological damage sustained during the war.\n\nIn the original series (1993\u201399) the identity of the invading force is never specified, which is most likely by explicit intent of the author. In the sequel series (2003\u201306) the invading force is specified as a coalition of highly populous South Asian nations, who see the vast underdeveloped spaces and natural resources of Australia as a way to tackle their [[human overpopulation]] problem, and the series features multinational colonies of enemy civilians being set up in conquered territory. Few parts of the war outside Ellie's immediate perspective are covered; the reader is not informed exactly how much of the country is under enemy control, though a radio broadcast early in the series confirms that several major costal cities, and much of the inland area has been seized by the invading forces. Furthermore, how well the war is going for the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian military]] is not covered, however, it's strongly inferred that they suffer heavy losses. \n\n''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels are one of the most popular and critically acclaimed series of novels aimed at young readers in Australian literature history.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\">6 August 2008 [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6341932.html Tomorrow Series Relaunched for Today's Readers] Publishersweekly.com</ref> It has sold over 3 million copies in Australia and has been translated into five languages.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\"/><ref name=\"sf\">[http://www.sfsite.com/12b/tom47.htm Bibliographer Researches Australian Children's Books] [http://www.nla.gov.au/ National Library of Australia] {{ISSN|1039-3498}}, no. 58, August 2002</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[The Dead of the Night]]'' (1994)\n* ''The Third Day, the Frost'' (1995) <small> (published in the U.S. and Canada as ''A Killing Frost'')</small>\n* ''Darkness, Be My Friend'' (1996)\n* ''Burning for Revenge'' (1997)\n* ''The Night is for Hunting'' (1998)\n* ''The Other Side of Dawn'' (1999)\n\n==Plot summary==\nEllie goes out camping in [[the bush]] for a week with her friends Homer, Lee, Kevin, Corrie, Robyn, and Fiona. They find a way into a large, vegetated sinkhole in a remote area of bush the locals call \"Hell\", and camp there for the week. During this time they see large numbers of planes flying through the night without lights, and though it is mentioned in conversation the following morning, they think little of it.\n\nWhen they return home they find that all the people are missing and their pets and livestock are dead or dying. They come to realise that Australia has been invaded and their family and friends have been taken prisoner. Avoiding capture by enemy soldiers, as well as retrieving Robyn and Lee who were stuck in the town and picking up one of their school friends Chris, the group return to Hell. After short period of recovery they start making plans to fight back.\n\nOver the course of the first three books in the series, the group succeeds in destroying a bridge that leads into Wirrawee, an enemy convoy, several houses that are being used by the enemy as a center of operations, and a nearby strategic harbour. After the harbour raid, the surviving members of the group are eventually captured and placed in a maximum security prison in Stratton. During an air-raid by the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] the group escapes but loses yet another member while doing so. They encounter a downed RNZAF pilot and arrange to be evacuated to New Zealand.\n\nBook four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend'', takes place several months later. The group is trying to live a normal life in New Zealand with other refugees, but are haunted by their memories of the war (which is still ongoing). They are approached by the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], who are seeking Australian guerrillas to act as guides for saboteur units that are being dropped into occupied Australian territory. The group returns to Wirrawee, their hometown, accompanied by a platoon of New Zealand troops. However the New Zealanders go missing while on a mission to destroy Wirrawee Airfield (which is being used as a major military airbase). Alone behind enemy lines once more, the group decides to attack the Airfield themselves but a combination of poor planning and bad luck causes them to fail. They return, depressed, to Hell.\n\nSoon after, through sheer luck, the group find themselves perfectly positioned to attempt another attack on the Airfield. This time they succeed and manage to destroy a majority of planes on the airfield. After the attack, the group find their way to the nearby city of Stratton. There they encounter a tribe of feral (and hostile) children, who have been living on the streets and hiding from enemy troops since the war began. The group rescue five of the children who have been captured by an enemy patrol and escape back to Hell. For a time the group looks after the children. During this time strained relationships are mended and the soul-destroying effects of the war are tempered by a chance to do something positive. However, this period does not last. A patrol ambushes the group near their base and after defeating their attackers in a prolonged firefight the group realises that they are no longer safe in Hell and make contact with New Zealand immediately.\n\nThey discover that the war is entering its final days and that groups of [[partisan (military)|partisan]]s like themselves are being asked to cause as much chaos behind enemy lines as possible while New Zealand and its allies launch an all-out offensive. The group arranges for the feral children to be evacuated to New Zealand and are provided with [[plastic explosives]] to carry out their task.\n\nThe group attacks a service station frequented by enemy convoys and are separated in the aftermath. Ellie is shot in the leg and taken prisoner. While interned, she discovers the location of her mother and father. She escapes and is reunited with her mother whom she stays with until news breaks that the war is over \u2013 Australia signs a [[peace treaty]] with the occupying power, resulting in the formation of a new nation on the continent for the invading forces and settlers.\n\nIt transpires that Wirrawee is on the Australian side of the border. Ellie, her mother and her father return to their farm and, like all the other survivors of the war, begin picking up the pieces of their lives.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The group===\n;Ellie Linton: The main protagonist and narrator of the series. Ellie was born and raised on a cattle and sheep farm not far from the edge of the country town of Wirrawee. She is loyal to her friends, to her family, she loves the Australian bush and the life on the land. Ellie prides herself on being the strongest member (and therefore one of the leaders) of the group. Nevertheless, she is often scared and uncertain of her actions and tries to hide what she perceives to be these moments of weakness from her friends.\n\n;Corrie Mackenzie: Ellie's best friend since childhood. It was Corrie who first suggested going on a camping trip into Hell. Corrie was shot and mortally wounded at the end of the first book. Corrie's death affects the group deeply, especially Ellie who eventually comes to terms with the loss in book four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend''.\n\n;Homer Yannos: Ellie's neighbour and close friend. Homer is forceful and domineering and has trouble dealing with other strong personalities. Prior to the war Homer appeared to be a wild and irresponsible boy. The war reveals him to be a strong leader. However, on occasions where he is not in control Homer reverts to his immature ways. As the war progresses he gradually relies on Ellie to get the group to safety.\n\n;Fiona Maxwell: Commonly referred to as 'Fi' by the group, she had a sheltered upbringing before the war. Fi was shown early on to be the least physically capable of the group. Despite this Fi manages to find the courage within herself to complete the tasks she has been set, though she rarely takes an active role in planning the group's attacks. Fi becomes Ellie's confidante after Corrie's departure and acts as the most rational member of the group after Robyn. She develops a slow romance with the wild Homer.\n\n;Lee Takkam: Prior to the war Lee was a studious, somewhat lonely boy. During the war Lee demonstrates an aptitude for violence, a tendency to act impulsively and a strong desire for vengeance, especially after finding out his parents were killed. He develops a relationship with Ellie.\n\n;Robyn Mathers: A friend of Ellie and Corrie's with really strong held religious beliefs. Robyn is calm under pressure and is a capable leader. She regards herself as a [[pacifist]] and refuses to participate in any activities where she will be required to directly take a life. Despite this she is convinced that what the group is doing is right and enjoys the adrenaline rush that being in dangerous situations gives her.\n\n;Kevin Holmes: Corrie's boyfriend, Kevin fancies himself a tough guy but is shown to have difficulty handling high pressure situations. Kevin is separated from the group at the end of book one, ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''. When he is reunited with them again near the beginning of book three, ''Third Day, The Frost'', he is shocked to see how brutal the war has made his friends. His knowledge of explosives enables the group to successfully attack the Cobbler's Bay harbor.\n\n;Chris Lang: Prior to the war Chris was an introverted, but well liked boy. Chris was one of the few not taken prisoner when enemy forces seized Wirrawee. The group encounter him soon after returning from Hell and he decides to join with them. Although regarded as a genius by all of his friends, Chris is unable to apply that genius to the group's current situation. As the war wears on he withdraws more and more into his own head, into his world of illicit substances, depression and poetry.\n\n===Others===\n;Major Harvey:A former school deputy principal who was once in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]], Harvey is introduced as the leader of Harvey's Heroes, a group of adult partisans. It is later revealed that Harvey was working with the invaders and that the Harvey's Heroes organisation was established to deliver would-be resistance fighters into the hands of the invaders. As such he plays as a primary antagonist to the group.\n\n;Colonel Finley:An officer of the [[New Zealand Army]]'s [[New Zealand Intelligence Corps|Intelligence Corps]]. Finley supervised the group's recovery and well-being during their time in New Zealand, and later becomes their ''de facto'' commanding officer when the group returned to Wirrawee.\n\n;Gavin: A young deaf boy who was part of a gang of war orphans, led by a dictatorial boy called Aldo, living in Stratton since the war began. Of the children the group rescue, only Gavin had occupied a position amongst Aldo's inner circle. Being used to a position of power, Gavin immediately establishes himself as the leader of the children. He initially doesn't trust Ellie and her friends but soon comes to feel affection and respect for them.\n\n==Themes==\nIn his book ''John Marsden: Darkness, Shadow, and Light'' John Noell Moore, associate professor of English at [[The College of William & Mary]], identifies several significant themes of the series; the transition from innocence to experience; the power of the Australian landscape; understanding the past as a way of dealing with the present and preparing for the future; and writing and storytelling and how they shape identity.<ref name=DarkShadow>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=John Noell|title=John Marsden; Darkness, Shadow and Light|year=2010|publisher=Scarcrow Press|location=Blue Ridge Summit, PA, USA|isbn=9780810877436|pages=199}}</ref>\n\nThe transition from innocence to experience is shown in transformations in Ellie's thinking and her changing notions towards leadership and courage as the series progresses.<ref name=DarkShadow /> Ellie's reasons for chronicling her experiences also develop throughout the series. She starts out recording for the group who don't want to die unnoticed and forgotten and continues writing for herself to better understand her own thoughts and feelings. Later on she writes to recreate the past which has become a lost world to her and preserve the lessons that she has learnt from it.<ref name=DarkShadow /> The Australian bush becomes \"a symbol of stability in a world that seems to be disintegrating\". Its presence gives hope to the characters throughout the series.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\nOther notable themes in the series are the role of family and friendship; sexual maturation and the conflicting worldviews of teenagers and adults.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\n==Inspiration==\nJohn Marsden was inspired to write ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' while watching an [[ANZAC Day]] march.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  A large number of teenagers were in attendance, paying respect to the sacrifices made by the past generations. He wondered how they might react if they were placed in the same position that their grandparents were at their age. He felt that the popular media's view of the average young person as \"illiterate, drug crazed, suicidal, alcoholic, criminal, promiscuous, a dole [[wiktionary:bludger#Noun|bludger]], or all of the above\" was wrong.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}} It seemed to him that like the generations before them modern teenagers would \"dig deep and find reserves of initiative, maturity, responsibility and even heroism\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}}\n\nWith ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels Marsden set out to write an \"old fashioned adventure story\". To do this Marsden looked to the authors he had read most avidly as a teenager, thriller writers such as [[Ian Fleming]], [[Desmond Bagley]], [[John Buchan]], [[Hammond Innes]] and [[Alistair MacLean]]. He sought to emulate their approaches to timing, pacing and building tension and suspense and combine them with \"the new teenage genres, where feelings, relationships and character development were all-important.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Wardle|first=Lisa|title=John Marsden \u2013 Author Interview Series|url=http://lisa-wardle.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/john-marsden-author-interview-series.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Marsden|first=John|title=Write of Passage|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/write-of-passage-20100820-138mu.html#ixzz21ERVL160|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe inspiration for the rural setting of the series was what Marsden saw as the disappearance of the bush tales that he had enjoyed growing up. He had noticed that many novels for young people published in recent decades were about issues arising for families and children living in the suburbs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  In ''Marsden on Marsden'' he writes:\n\n:\"I\u2019ve written some of these novels myself, and I know and appreciate the need for them, but I thought it was a pity that we had gotten so far away from the bush and country novels that were popular in earlier generations, and I quite consciously set out to revive that genre.\"{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}}\n\nMarsden cites the works of Australian Children's Author [[Mary Grant Bruce]] as major influence on the series. In his introduction to the ''John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics'' imprint of Bruce's 1940 novel ''Peter and Co'' Marsden notes the book's similarities to his series. Both are stories about groups of young people battling enemy forces intent on the invasion of Australia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant Bruce|first=Mary|title=Peter and Co (John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics)|year=2001|publisher=Pan Australia}}</ref> Marsden states that while he didn't intentionally set out to emulate ''Peter and Co'' when he wrote ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' he does see many of his memories of the novel reflected in his work.\n\nEllie, the Tomorrow series central protagonist was modelled after the \"courageous and resourceful\" farm girl Norah from Mary Grant Bruce's Billabong series of novels.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}} The series follows the fortunes of the Linton family, the owners of a large cattle station in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], during first half of the 20th century. In the Tomorrow Series it is implied that Ellie is the great-granddaughter of Norah's brother Jim.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=100}} The character was also inspired by Charlotte Austin, a student who Marsden had taught and admired for her resourcefulness, honesty and \"gutsy approach to life\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=73}}\n\nThe character of Homer was based on a number of students from rural backgrounds that Marsden had taught. He noticed that many of these students, who at home drove cars, ploughed fields, harvested crops, worked as shearers and more, had trouble adjusting to an environment where they \"were not trusted to change a light globe or put a Band-Aid on a cut\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=76}} These students became frustrated and angry and their immature behaviour was the result.\n\nRobyn was modelled after Marsden's own sister, a deeply committed Christian. Marsden was inspired to write the character when he noticed that while many teenagers identified themselves as Christians this group was not represented at all in fiction written for them.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  Chris was an approximation of Marsden himself as a teen. Though unlike Chris, Marsden never used drugs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}\n\nWhen asked why young people related to the characters in his books, Ellie in particular, Marsden speculated that, like himself, they found their strength and self-reliance inspirational.<ref name=RollerC>{{cite web|title=''Interviews, John Marsden'' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rollercoaster/therap/interviews/s1532838.htm|work=Rollercoaster|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> In an interview with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Rollercoaster website he explained what inspired him to highlight these virtues in his work:\n\n:\"I've always been attracted to strong people in real life and in fiction. As a kid I read a lot of books like ''[[The Naked Island (book)|The Naked Island]]'' about [[Russell Braddon]] and his experiences on the [[Burma-Thai railway|Burma-Thai Railway]] and ''[[The Cattle King]]'', which is the biography of [[Sidney Kidman]], and they had a profound impact on me and I read those books many times. So I think the idea of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those guys had nothing except their own strength and their own mind power. There's something noble about that.\"<ref name=RollerC />\n\n==Similarities to other John Marsden novels==\n* In Marsden's 1988 novel ''The Journey'' the main character finds a hut belonging to a dead hermit. A similar sequence occurs in ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''.\n* In ''Out of Time'' (1990) the protagonist's country, implied to be Australia, is at war with an unspecified enemy. The protagonist has a sister called Ellie.\n* An Australia type nation is invaded in John Marsden and [[Shaun Tan|Shaun Tan's]] picture book ''The Rabbits'' (1998)\n* ''Home and Away'' (2008), a picture book by John Marsden and Matt Ottley, tells the story of a family fleeing from a war-torn Australia. Their story is similar to the story of how Lee's mother came to Australia as a refugee.\n\n==Reception==\nUpon publication, the series was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critics praised the series for its insightful look at a wide range of issues and suspense filled narrative. ''[[The Age]]'' proclaimed the series \"the best series for Australian teens of all time...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tomorrow-series.eu/en/books/07-the-other-side-of-dawn|title=The Tomorrow Series \u2013 Your source for everything about John Marsden's series, Tomorrow, When the War Began and the upcoming Tomorrow movies.

(2003), ''Incurable'' (2005), and ''Circle of Flight'' (2006). The three books detail Ellie's struggles in post-war life in Wirrawee. Ellie finds herself running the family farm after the murder of her parents, and dealing with Gavin, the deaf boy she rescued during the war. Shortly after the death of her parents, Ellie faces bankruptcy and turns to Homer's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Yannos, for help.

The novels are related from the [[first-person narrative|first-person]] perspective by Ellie Linton, a teenage girl, who is part of a small band of teenagers waging a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] war on the enemy soldiers in the region around their fictional home town of Wirrawee. The name of the series is derived from the title of the first book, ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]''.\n\nThe books in the series were originally published from 1993\u201399, by [[Pan Macmillan]] and have been reprinted sixteen times. A sequel series, ''The Ellie Chronicles'', was later published from 2003\u201306. The follow-up series concerns itself largely with the attempts of society and the protagonist to regain a normal level of functioning in the face of the psychological damage sustained during the war.\n\nThe invading force is specified as a coalition of highly populous South Asian nations, who see the vast underdeveloped spaces and natural resources of Australia as a way to tackle their [[human overpopulation]] problem, and the series features multinational colonies of enemy civilians being set up in conquered territory. Few parts of the war outside Ellie's immediate perspective are covered; the reader is not informed exactly how much of the country is under enemy control, though a radio broadcast early in the series confirms that several major costal cities, and much of the inland area has been seized by the invading forces. Furthermore, how well the war is going for the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian military]] is not covered, however, it's strongly inferred that they suffer heavy losses. \n\n''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels are one of the most popular and critically acclaimed series of novels aimed at young readers in Australian literature history.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\">6 August 2008 [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6341932.html Tomorrow Series Relaunched for Today's Readers] Publishersweekly.com</ref> It has sold over 3 million copies in Australia and has been translated into five languages.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\"/><ref name=\"sf\">[http://www.sfsite.com/12b/tom47.htm Bibliographer Researches Australian Children's Books] [http://www.nla.gov.au/ National Library of Australia] {{ISSN|1039-3498}}, no. 58, August 2002</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[The Dead of the Night]]'' (1994)\n* ''The Third Day, the Frost'' (1995) <small> (published in the U.S. and Canada as ''A Killing Frost'')</small>\n* ''Darkness, Be My Friend'' (1996)\n* ''Burning for Revenge'' (1997)\n* ''The Night is for Hunting'' (1998)\n* ''The Other Side of Dawn'' (1999)\n\n==Plot summary==\nEllie goes out camping in [[the bush]] for a week with her friends Homer, Lee, Kevin, Corrie, Robyn, and Fiona. They find a way into a large, vegetated sinkhole in a remote area of bush the locals call \"Hell\", and camp there for the week. During this time they see large numbers of planes flying through the night without lights, and though it is mentioned in conversation the following morning, they think little of it.\n\nWhen they return home they find that all the people are missing and their pets and livestock are dead or dying. They come to realise that Australia has been invaded and their family and friends have been taken prisoner. Avoiding capture by enemy soldiers, as well as retrieving Robyn and Lee who were stuck in the town and picking up one of their school friends Chris, the group return to Hell. After short period of recovery they start making plans to fight back.\n\nOver the course of the first three books in the series, the group succeeds in destroying a bridge that leads into Wirrawee, an enemy convoy, several houses that are being used by the enemy as a center of operations, and a nearby strategic harbour. After the harbour raid, the surviving members of the group are eventually captured and placed in a maximum security prison in Stratton. During an air-raid by the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] the group escapes but loses yet another member while doing so. They encounter a downed RNZAF pilot and arrange to be evacuated to New Zealand.\n\nBook four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend'', takes place several months later. The group is trying to live a normal life in New Zealand with other refugees, but are haunted by their memories of the war (which is still ongoing). They are approached by the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], who are seeking Australian guerrillas to act as guides for saboteur units that are being dropped into occupied Australian territory. The group returns to Wirrawee, their hometown, accompanied by a platoon of New Zealand troops. However the New Zealanders go missing while on a mission to destroy Wirrawee Airfield (which is being used as a major military airbase). Alone behind enemy lines once more, the group decides to attack the Airfield themselves but a combination of poor planning and bad luck causes them to fail. They return, depressed, to Hell.\n\nSoon after, through sheer luck, the group find themselves perfectly positioned to attempt another attack on the Airfield. This time they succeed and manage to destroy a majority of planes on the airfield. After the attack, the group find their way to the nearby city of Stratton. There they encounter a tribe of feral (and hostile) children, who have been living on the streets and hiding from enemy troops since the war began. The group rescue five of the children who have been captured by an enemy patrol and escape back to Hell. For a time the group looks after the children. During this time strained relationships are mended and the soul-destroying effects of the war are tempered by a chance to do something positive. However, this period does not last. A patrol ambushes the group near their base and after defeating their attackers in a prolonged firefight the group realises that they are no longer safe in Hell and make contact with New Zealand immediately.\n\nThey discover that the war is entering its final days and that groups of [[partisan (military)|partisan]]s like themselves are being asked to cause as much chaos behind enemy lines as possible while New Zealand and its allies launch an all-out offensive. The group arranges for the feral children to be evacuated to New Zealand and are provided with [[plastic explosives]] to carry out their task.\n\nThe group attacks a service station frequented by enemy convoys and are separated in the aftermath. Ellie is shot in the leg and taken prisoner. While interned, she discovers the location of her mother and father. She escapes and is reunited with her mother whom she stays with until news breaks that the war is over \u2013 Australia signs a [[peace treaty]] with the occupying power, resulting in the formation of a new nation on the continent for the invading forces and settlers.\n\nIt transpires that Wirrawee is on the Australian side of the border. Ellie, her mother and her father return to their farm and, like all the other survivors of the war, begin picking up the pieces of their lives.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The group===\n;Ellie Linton: The main protagonist and narrator of the series. Ellie was born and raised on a cattle and sheep farm not far from the edge of the country town of Wirrawee. She is loyal to her friends, to her family, she loves the Australian bush and the life on the land. Ellie prides herself on being the strongest member (and therefore one of the leaders) of the group. Nevertheless, she is often scared and uncertain of her actions and tries to hide what she perceives to be these moments of weakness from her friends.\n\n;Corrie Mackenzie: Ellie's best friend since childhood. It was Corrie who first suggested going on a camping trip into Hell. Corrie was shot and mortally wounded at the end of the first book. Corrie's death affects the group deeply, especially Ellie who eventually comes to terms with the loss in book four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend''.\n\n;Homer Yannos: Ellie's neighbour and close friend. Homer is forceful and domineering and has trouble dealing with other strong personalities. Prior to the war Homer appeared to be a wild and irresponsible boy. The war reveals him to be a strong leader. However, on occasions where he is not in control Homer reverts to his immature ways. As the war progresses he gradually relies on Ellie to get the group to safety.\n\n;Fiona Maxwell: Commonly referred to as 'Fi' by the group, she had a sheltered upbringing before the war. Fi was shown early on to be the least physically capable of the group. Despite this Fi manages to find the courage within herself to complete the tasks she has been set, though she rarely takes an active role in planning the group's attacks. Fi becomes Ellie's confidante after Corrie's departure and acts as the most rational member of the group after Robyn. She develops a slow romance with the wild Homer.\n\n;Lee Takkam: Prior to the war Lee was a studious, somewhat lonely boy. During the war Lee demonstrates an aptitude for violence, a tendency to act impulsively and a strong desire for vengeance, especially after finding out his parents were killed. He develops a relationship with Ellie.\n\n;Robyn Mathers: A friend of Ellie and Corrie's with really strong held religious beliefs. Robyn is calm under pressure and is a capable leader. She regards herself as a [[pacifist]] and refuses to participate in any activities where she will be required to directly take a life. Despite this she is convinced that what the group is doing is right and enjoys the adrenaline rush that being in dangerous situations gives her.\n\n;Kevin Holmes: Corrie's boyfriend, Kevin fancies himself a tough guy but is shown to have difficulty handling high pressure situations. Kevin is separated from the group at the end of book one, ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''. When he is reunited with them again near the beginning of book three, ''Third Day, The Frost'', he is shocked to see how brutal the war has made his friends. His knowledge of explosives enables the group to successfully attack the Cobbler's Bay harbor.\n\n;Chris Lang: Prior to the war Chris was an introverted, but well liked boy. Chris was one of the few not taken prisoner when enemy forces seized Wirrawee. The group encounter him soon after returning from Hell and he decides to join with them. Although regarded as a genius by all of his friends, Chris is unable to apply that genius to the group's current situation. As the war wears on he withdraws more and more into his own head, into his world of illicit substances, depression and poetry.\n\n===Others===\n;Major Harvey:A former school deputy principal who was once in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]], Harvey is introduced as the leader of Harvey's Heroes, a group of adult partisans. It is later revealed that Harvey was working with the invaders and that the Harvey's Heroes organisation was established to deliver would-be resistance fighters into the hands of the invaders. As such he plays as a primary antagonist to the group.\n\n;Colonel Finley:An officer of the [[New Zealand Army]]'s [[New Zealand Intelligence Corps|Intelligence Corps]]. Finley supervised the group's recovery and well-being during their time in New Zealand, and later becomes their ''de facto'' commanding officer when the group returned to Wirrawee.\n\n;Gavin: A young deaf boy who was part of a gang of war orphans, led by a dictatorial boy called Aldo, living in Stratton since the war began. Of the children the group rescue, only Gavin had occupied a position amongst Aldo's inner circle. Being used to a position of power, Gavin immediately establishes himself as the leader of the children. He initially doesn't trust Ellie and her friends but soon comes to feel affection and respect for them.\n\n==Themes==\nIn his book ''John Marsden: Darkness, Shadow, and Light'' John Noell Moore, associate professor of English at [[The College of William & Mary]], identifies several significant themes of the series; the transition from innocence to experience; the power of the Australian landscape; understanding the past as a way of dealing with the present and preparing for the future; and writing and storytelling and how they shape identity.<ref name=DarkShadow>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=John Noell|title=John Marsden; Darkness, Shadow and Light|year=2010|publisher=Scarcrow Press|location=Blue Ridge Summit, PA, USA|isbn=9780810877436|pages=199}}</ref>\n\nThe transition from innocence to experience is shown in transformations in Ellie's thinking and her changing notions towards leadership and courage as the series progresses.<ref name=DarkShadow /> Ellie's reasons for chronicling her experiences also develop throughout the series. She starts out recording for the group who don't want to die unnoticed and forgotten and continues writing for herself to better understand her own thoughts and feelings. Later on she writes to recreate the past which has become a lost world to her and preserve the lessons that she has learnt from it.<ref name=DarkShadow /> The Australian bush becomes \"a symbol of stability in a world that seems to be disintegrating\". Its presence gives hope to the characters throughout the series.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\nOther notable themes in the series are the role of family and friendship; sexual maturation and the conflicting worldviews of teenagers and adults.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\n==Inspiration==\nJohn Marsden was inspired to write ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' while watching an [[ANZAC Day]] march.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  A large number of teenagers were in attendance, paying respect to the sacrifices made by the past generations. He wondered how they might react if they were placed in the same position that their grandparents were at their age. He felt that the popular media's view of the average young person as \"illiterate, drug crazed, suicidal, alcoholic, criminal, promiscuous, a dole [[wiktionary:bludger#Noun|bludger]], or all of the above\" was wrong.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}} It seemed to him that like the generations before them modern teenagers would \"dig deep and find reserves of initiative, maturity, responsibility and even heroism\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}}\n\nWith ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels Marsden set out to write an \"old fashioned adventure story\". To do this Marsden looked to the authors he had read most avidly as a teenager, thriller writers such as [[Ian Fleming]], [[Desmond Bagley]], [[John Buchan]], [[Hammond Innes]] and [[Alistair MacLean]]. He sought to emulate their approaches to timing, pacing and building tension and suspense and combine them with \"the new teenage genres, where feelings, relationships and character development were all-important.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Wardle|first=Lisa|title=John Marsden \u2013 Author Interview Series|url=http://lisa-wardle.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/john-marsden-author-interview-series.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Marsden|first=John|title=Write of Passage|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/write-of-passage-20100820-138mu.html#ixzz21ERVL160|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe inspiration for the rural setting of the series was what Marsden saw as the disappearance of the bush tales that he had enjoyed growing up. He had noticed that many novels for young people published in recent decades were about issues arising for families and children living in the suburbs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  In ''Marsden on Marsden'' he writes:\n\n:\"I\u2019ve written some of these novels myself, and I know and appreciate the need for them, but I thought it was a pity that we had gotten so far away from the bush and country novels that were popular in earlier generations, and I quite consciously set out to revive that genre.\"{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}}\n\nMarsden cites the works of Australian Children's Author [[Mary Grant Bruce]] as major influence on the series. In his introduction to the ''John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics'' imprint of Bruce's 1940 novel ''Peter and Co'' Marsden notes the book's similarities to his series. Both are stories about groups of young people battling enemy forces intent on the invasion of Australia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant Bruce|first=Mary|title=Peter and Co (John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics)|year=2001|publisher=Pan Australia}}</ref> Marsden states that while he didn't intentionally set out to emulate ''Peter and Co'' when he wrote ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' he does see many of his memories of the novel reflected in his work.\n\nEllie, the Tomorrow series central protagonist was modelled after the \"courageous and resourceful\" farm girl Norah from Mary Grant Bruce's Billabong series of novels.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}} The series follows the fortunes of the Linton family, the owners of a large cattle station in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], during first half of the 20th century. In the Tomorrow Series it is implied that Ellie is the great-granddaughter of Norah's brother Jim.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=100}} The character was also inspired by Charlotte Austin, a student who Marsden had taught and admired for her resourcefulness, honesty and \"gutsy approach to life\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=73}}\n\nThe character of Homer was based on a number of students from rural backgrounds that Marsden had taught. He noticed that many of these students, who at home drove cars, ploughed fields, harvested crops, worked as shearers and more, had trouble adjusting to an environment where they \"were not trusted to change a light globe or put a Band-Aid on a cut\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=76}} These students became frustrated and angry and their immature behaviour was the result.\n\nRobyn was modelled after Marsden's own sister, a deeply committed Christian. Marsden was inspired to write the character when he noticed that while many teenagers identified themselves as Christians this group was not represented at all in fiction written for them.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  Chris was an approximation of Marsden himself as a teen. Though unlike Chris, Marsden never used drugs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}\n\nWhen asked why young people related to the characters in his books, Ellie in particular, Marsden speculated that, like himself, they found their strength and self-reliance inspirational.<ref name=RollerC>{{cite web|title=''Interviews, John Marsden'' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rollercoaster/therap/interviews/s1532838.htm|work=Rollercoaster|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> In an interview with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Rollercoaster website he explained what inspired him to highlight these virtues in his work:\n\n:\"I've always been attracted to strong people in real life and in fiction. As a kid I read a lot of books like ''[[The Naked Island (book)|The Naked Island]]'' about [[Russell Braddon]] and his experiences on the [[Burma-Thai railway|Burma-Thai Railway]] and ''[[The Cattle King]]'', which is the biography of [[Sidney Kidman]], and they had a profound impact on me and I read those books many times. So I think the idea of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those guys had nothing except their own strength and their own mind power. There's something noble about that.\"<ref name=RollerC />\n\n==Similarities to other John Marsden novels==\n* In Marsden's 1988 novel ''The Journey'' the main character finds a hut belonging to a dead hermit. A similar sequence occurs in ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''.\n* In ''Out of Time'' (1990) the protagonist's country, implied to be Australia, is at war with an unspecified enemy. The protagonist has a sister called Ellie.\n* An Australia type nation is invaded in John Marsden and [[Shaun Tan|Shaun Tan's]] picture book ''The Rabbits'' (1998)\n* ''Home and Away'' (2008), a picture book by John Marsden and Matt Ottley, tells the story of a family fleeing from a war-torn Australia. Their story is similar to the story of how Lee's mother came to Australia as a refugee.\n\n==Reception==\nUpon publication, the series was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critics praised the series for its insightful look at a wide range of issues and suspense filled narrative.

(2003), ''Incurable'' (2005), and ''Circle of Flight'' (2006). The three books detail Ellie's struggles in post-war life in Wirrawee. Ellie finds herself running the family farm after the murder of her parents, and dealing with Gavin, the deaf boy she rescued during the war. Shortly after the death of her parents, Ellie faces bankruptcy and turns to Homer's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Yannos, for help. In addition, a group called \"Liberation\", headed by the mysterious \"Scarlet Pimple\" (a play of words on \"[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]\"), are conducting secret border raids against the new nation.\n\n==Adaptations==\n===Film===\n{{Main|Tomorrow, When the War Began (film)}}\nIn June 2009, [[Screen Australia]] announced that it would fund the development of the feature film ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'', written and directed by screenwriter [[Stuart Beattie]] (''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]], [[Collateral (film)|Collateral]], [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''), and produced by Andrew Mason for Ambience Entertainment, reportedly to begin production in late 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=840471|title=John Marsden book to be made into film|work=[[Nine News]]|date=22 July 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912012709/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=840471|archivedate=12 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iecfa450e38f03b772d4e458e999c8f5c |title=Stuart Beattie looks to 'Tomorrow' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=28 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619081417/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iecfa450e38f03b772d4e458e999c8f5c |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}</ref><ref name=screenaustralia>{{Cite news|url=http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/mr_090616_approvals.asp|title=Screen Australia announces funding for five features including ''Wog Boy 2: Kings of Mykonos'' and ''Tomorrow When the War Began''|work=[[Screen Australia]]|date=16 June 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028193357/http://screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/mr_090616_approvals.asp|archivedate=28 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Raymond Terrace]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of [[New South Wales]], was chosen as a major location for producing the film.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/news/local/news/general/terrace-on-centre-stage/1618590.aspx|title=Terrace on centre stage|work=Port Stephens Examiner|date=9 September 2009|accessdate=16 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013115504/http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/news/local/news/general/terrace-on-centre-stage/1618590.aspx|archive-date=13 October 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The film was released in Australian cinemas on 2 September 2010.

Two months later, the [[Port Adelaide Football Club]] reached terms of agreement with the AFL to enter a team into its competition in season 1991. The other nine SANFL clubs reacted strongly and entered into litigation in an endeavour to halt Port's bid. As the terms offered were more favourable than previously offered, talks were resumed. On 19 September 1990, the AFL approved the bid for a new South Australian club to enter to the league, rather than a single existing SANFL club.<ref name=ShortHist/>\n\nThe Adelaide Crows played their first season in the AFL in [[1991 AFL season|1991]].

The Crows finished fourth to qualify for its first finals series since 1993, and hosted fifth-placed {{AFL WC}} in the First Elimination Final. In the first final ever to be played at [[Football Park]], the Crows won 14.15 (99) to 9.12 (66). The next week, Adelaide benefited from the finals system in use at the time and hosted the higher ranked {{AFL Gee}}, who had finished two places above the Crows but were forced to play away due to losing the previous week to {{AFL Nor}}. The Crows won narrowly in a controversial match, where a clear forward 50 mark to Geelong's [[Leigh Colbert]] during a critical stage of the third quarter was not awarded by field umpire Grant Vernon. Final scores: Adelaide 11.10 (76) to Geelong 9.14 (68). This set up an away Preliminary Final against the {{AFL WB}} at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. Despite losing [[Coleman Medal]]list [[Tony Modra]], who had kicked 84 goals for the season, to an [[anterior cruciate ligament injury|ACL injury]] in the first quarter and trailing by 31 points at half time, the Crows kicked four unanswered goals in the last quarter to record a two-point victory, 12.21 (93) to 13.13 (91), with [[Darren Jarman]] kicking a goal to put Adelaide in front with less than two minutes remaining. This allowed the Crows to qualify for their first AFL Grand Final, to be played against {{AFL StK}} at the MCG a week later.\n\nSt Kilda, chasing just their second premiership in VFL/AFL history, were warm favourites to win the [[1997 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]], having come first in the minor round and won both of their finals by margins of 46 and 31 points, against an Adelaide side without Tony Modra, [[Mark Ricciuto]] and goalsneak [[Peter Vardy (footballer)|Peter Vardy]] due to injury. However, the Crows again overcame a half-time deficit, kicking 14 second-half goals to win by 31 points, 19.11 (125) to 13.16 (94). [[Darren Jarman]] kicked six goals, five of which came in the last quarter, whilst utility [[Shane Ellen]] kicked a career-best five and [[Troy Bond]] kicked four. [[Andrew McLeod]], who gathered 31 possessions across half-back and in the midfield, won the [[Norm Smith Medal]] for the best player on-field in the Grand Final. The win is arguably one of the finest moments in South Australian sporting history.\n\nFew expected the Crows to successfully defend their premiership the following year. Adelaide often struggled in close matches during the [[1998 AFL season]]; seven of their nine losses were by 13 points or less, compared to only three wins by corresponding margins (they finished the regular season fifth on the ladder, with a record of 13-9). The Crows were well beaten by [[Melbourne Demons|Melbourne]] in the qualifying final at the [[MCG]] by 48 points, and at the time, looked far from a premiership threat. Since season 2000, a loss in the finals by a team outside the top four would result in instant elimination, but the Crows benefited from a quirk in the McIntyre finals system that was in use during the 90's and still progressed to the second week, drawn to play a semi final against the [[Sydney Swans]] at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]]. The Crows bounced back from their disappointing first finals loss and recorded a comprehensive upset 27-point win against the Swans in the wet, which set up a Preliminary Final rematch against the Western Bulldogs. Despite going into the match as underdogs, the Crows played some of their best football of the year to soundly beat the Dogs by 68 points - 24.17 (161) to 13.15 (93). It was a complete contrast to the thriller that took place the previous year, with [[Matthew Robran]] kicking six goals and [[Andrew McLeod]], opposed to renowned tagger [[Tony Liberatore]], booting seven.\n\nLike the previous year, Adelaide went into the [[1998 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] as underdogs, playing against {{AFL Nor}}, who had won the premiership in 1996 and had won eleven consecutive matches leading up to the Grand Final. North Melbourne led by 24 points at half-time, 6.15 (51) to 4.3 (27), with only their inaccurate goalkicking keeping Adelaide in the contest. However, as they had in the previous year, Adelaide dominated the second half to win by 35 points, 15.15 (105) to 8.22 (70). [[Darren Jarman]] kicked five goals, while [[Andrew McLeod]] won his second successive Norm Smith Medal, an unprecedented feat. Club legend [[Mark Ricciuto]] won the Crows' Club Champion award in 1998. Following a disappointing year in [[1999 AFL season|1999]], premiership coach [[Malcolm Blight]] resigned from the role and the Crows entered the new [[millennium]] with two premierships under their belt.\n\n===2000s: Finals and near misses===\nThe Crows next made the finals in [[2001 AFL season]], this after losing their opening three matches for the season. Adelaide played fifth-placed {{AFL Car}} at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] in the First Elimination Final and were roundly defeated, 17.16 (118) to 6.14 (50). High-profile forward [[Darren Jarman]] announced his retirement after the match. Adelaide's impressive [[2002 AFL season]] (in which they achieved a 15\u20137 win-loss record) came undone at the penultimate stage, losing the Collingwood in the Preliminary Final at the MCG. [[Ben Hart]] won his second Malcolm Blight Medal in 2002, with [[Tyson Edwards]] finishing runner-up. [[Brett Burton]] led the Crows' goalkickers with 51. Hart and [[Mark Ricciuto]] were both named as All-Australians. Adelaide then extracted some revenge by defeating Collingwood in the [[2003 Wizard Home Loans Cup|pre-season competition]] in [[2003 AFL season|2003]], a first win of its kind for the club. The Crows' impressive 2003 season was eventually halted by the {{AFL BL}} at [[the Gabba]] in the semi-finals. That season Adelaide captain [[Mark Ricciuto]] became the first Crow to win the [[Brownlow Medal]] for the best and fairest player in the AFL in a three-way tie with [[Adam Goodes]] and [[Nathan Buckley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.droppunt.com/brownlow2003.htm |title=Brownlow Medal 2003 - 2003 Brownlow won by Nathan Buckley, Adam Goodes and Mark Ricciuto |publisher=Droppunt.com |accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref> The Crows returned to finals in [[2005 AFL season|2005]] and recorded a famous win in what to this day remains the only [[Showdown (AFL)|Showdown]] match against rivals {{AFL PA}} in the semi-finals. They then lost once more at the penultimate stage (preliminary final), to [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] at [[Subiaco Oval]] by 16 points. This was a feat the club unfortunately repeated in [[2006 AFL season|2006]] when they again lost to West Coast in the preliminary final, this time at home and by an even smaller margin.\n\nRemarkably, Adelaide went on to qualify for finals for each of the remaining seasons in the 2000s, falling short at the elimination or semi-final on each occasion. [[Collingwood FC|Collingwood]] proved to be the most obvious of villains, knocking the Crows out of the finals race successively in [[2008 AFL season|2008]] and [[2009 AFL season|2009]]. [[Andrew McLeod]] and [[Bernie Vince]] won club best and fairest awards in that time.\n\n'''Adelaide's [[AFL finals series|finals]] runs in the 2000s'''\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Year\n!Lost in\n!Opponent\n!Margin of defeat\n|-\n|[[2001 AFL season|2001]]\n| Elimination Final\n| {{AFL Car}}\n| 68 points\n|-\n|[[2002 AFL season|2002]]\n| Preliminary Final\n| {{AFL Col}}\n| 28 points\n|-\n|[[2003 AFL season|2003]]\n| Semi Final\n| {{AFL BL}}\n| 42 points\n|-\n|[[2005 AFL season|2005]]\n| Preliminary Final\n| {{AFL WCE}}\n| 16 points\n|-\n|[[2006 AFL season|2006]]\n| Preliminary Final\n| {{AFL WCE}}\n| 10 points\n|-\n|[[2007 AFL season|2007]]\n| Elimination Final\n| {{AFL Haw}}\n| 3 points\n|-\n|[[2008 AFL season|2008]]\n| Elimination Final\n| {{AFL Col}}\n| 31 points\n|-\n|[[2009 AFL season|2009]]\n| Semi Final\n| {{AFL Col}}\n| 5 points\n|}\n\n===2010s: Rebuilding and tragedy===\nAdelaide had a disastrous start to the [[2010 AFL season|2010 season]], losing their first six matches of the home and away season.

[[Scott Thompson (footballer born 1983)|Scott Thompson]] won the Malcolm Blight Medal (best and fairest award) for the season. New coach [[Brenton Sanderson]] began his era at the club with a pre-season premiership in [[2012 NAB Cup|2012]] and followed up that success with an above-expectations [[2012 AFL season|regular season]]; the Crows finishing 17-5 and never once losing consecutive matches. Adelaide eventually qualified to face [[minor premiers]] {{AFL Haw}} at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] in the First Preliminary Final. Hawthorn led for most of the match and despite Adelaide taking the lead with five minutes remaining, the Hawks responded to win the match by five points, yet another heartbreaking finals series loss for the Crows. Adelaide would then fall under the weight of expectations to some degree in the [[2013 AFL season|2013]] and [[2014 AFL season|2014]] seasons, narrowly missing the top 8 on both occasions.

The jumper is worn with navy shorts at all home and away games, except for away [[Showdown (AFL)|Showdowns]], where it is paired with white shorts. It has had minor variations through its history since debuting with the club in 1991, including adding a white outline to the numbers in 1996, and the removal of yellow cuffs and addition of navy blue panels down the sides (due to manufacturers template design) in 2006. In 2009 the yellow cuffs and full hoops returned. In 2010 the hoops were cut off again at the sides. For 2016, the club removed the side panels, returning to the full hoops of the original design. The original base design/idea has never changed in the club's 27-year history.<ref>http://footyjumpers.com/adelaidehome.htm</ref>\n\n;Clash guernsey\nThe '''''clash''''' guernsey is a predominantly white based design,<ref>http://footyjumpers.com/images/Adelaide-Clash-2017.gif</ref> worn in away games where the standard home guernsey may cause a clash of colours with the home team. It features three hoops around the sternum in the club's colours of red, yellow and navy blue, and is always worn with white shorts. The current clash guernsey was introduced in 2016, and is more similar to the home strip than those of previous years.\n\n====Past====\nIn previous seasons, the Crows have had variations of alternate guernseys.\n\n;Pre-season guernsey (1996\u201398)\nThe club briefly used an alternate design in the pre-season competition. It was still in the club colours, but featured the club logo prominently on the front and continuing over onto the back.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adelaide Pre-Season Jumpers|url=http://footyjumpers.com/adelaidePS.htm|website=FootyJumpers.com|accessdate=15 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908064940/http://footyjumpers.com/adelaidePS.htm|archivedate=8 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n;Away guernsey (1999\u20132009)\nThe away guernsey was originally intended for use in all matches designated as away games, except finals.

Its usage had waned since the introduction of the \"clash\" guernsey, to the point where it was only used twice in 2007, against the [[Western Bulldogs]] in round 2 and [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] in round 22. In a few away matches that year, the club also continued to use the traditional \"home\" guernsey, something which had rarely been done since the away strip was introduced. In response to this, a new away guernsey was introduced in 2008 featuring more red and yellow with a flying crow on the front \u2013 similar in design to the mid-90s pre-season jumper.\n\n;Clash guernsey (2006\u20132012)\n\nThe clash guernsey was first introduced for season 2006 and was radically different from the \"home\" and \"away\" designs at the time.<ref name=\"footyjumpers.com\"/> It was worn at all away games where the AFL deemed there to be a clash with the home team's guernsey design. Those clubs officially on the \"clash list\" included [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]], [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]], [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] and [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]]. Despite this, the AFL forced the club to wear it against other teams, such as [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] in 2007, [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] in 2008 and the [[Brisbane Lions]] in 2008 and 2009. The first clash guernsey was red, and was worn from 2006\u20132009. The club first adopted a white clash guernsey in 2010, which is worn in the majority of away games, meaning the traditional home jumper was rarely worn away from home. It featured the club logo on the front with stylised curves in club colours on the front and back with navy stripes down the sides. The design has been changed a number of times over the years, but has remained predominately white. The club now wears the clash guernsey in away games against all clubs aside from the [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]], [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] football clubs.\n\n; Alternative guernsey (2016-2017)\n\nThe '''''alternative''''' guernsey was the same design as the current clash guernsey, but with a gold base instead of white.<ref>http://footyjumpers.com/images/Adelaide-Alt-2017.gif</ref> It was worn in away games in which it provided a greater contrast with the home team than either the home or white clash guernseys. Those teams were [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne,]] [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton,]] [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] and [[Western Bulldogs]] football clubs. It was always worn with white shorts.\n\n==Membership base and sponsorship==\nIn 2006, the club made history becoming the first club in VFL/AFL history to have more than 50,000 members. They broke that record in 2007, signing up 50,146 members after only round one of the season. The club failed to continue this record run and subsequently signed 48,720 members in 2008.

The Crows defeated the eventual premiers by a hefty 86-point margin, winning 24.11 (155) to 9.15 (69).<ref name=firstgame>{{cite web|title=Adelaide's first game, 1991|url=http://www.afc.com.au/the-club/history/first-game-1991|website=AFC.com.au|access-date=20 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008132349/http://www.afc.com.au/the-club/history/first-game-1991|archive-date=8 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The club reached its first [[AFL finals series|finals series]] in the [[1993 AFL season]], eventually losing to [[Essendon FC|Essendon]] in the preliminary final.\n\n====Premiership glory in 1997 and 1998====\nThe year 1997 marked the entry of a second South Australian club, {{AFL PA}}. The Crows finished fourth to qualify for its first finals series since 1993, and hosted fifth-placed {{AFL WC}} in the First Elimination Final. In the first final ever to be played at [[Football Park]], the Crows won 14.15 (99) to 9.12 (66). The next week, Adelaide benefited from the finals system in use at the time and hosted the higher ranked {{AFL Gee}}, who had finished two places above the Crows but were forced to play away due to losing the previous week to {{AFL Nor}}. The Crows won narrowly in a controversial match, where a clear forward 50 mark to Geelong's [[Leigh Colbert]] during a critical stage of the third quarter was not awarded by field umpire Grant Vernon. Final scores: Adelaide 11.10 (76) to Geelong 9.14 (68). This set up an away Preliminary Final against the {{AFL WB}} at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]. Despite losing [[Coleman Medal]]list [[Tony Modra]], who had kicked 84 goals for the season, to an [[anterior cruciate ligament injury|ACL injury]] in the first quarter and trailing by 31 points at half time, the Crows kicked four unanswered goals in the last quarter to record a two-point victory, 12.21 (93) to 13.13 (91), with [[Darren Jarman]] kicking a goal to put Adelaide in front with less than two minutes remaining. This allowed the Crows to qualify for their first AFL Grand Final, to be played against {{AFL StK}} at the MCG a week later.\n\nSt Kilda, chasing just their second premiership in VFL/AFL history, were warm favourites to win the [[1997 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]], having come first in the minor round and won both of their finals by margins of 46 and 31 points, against an Adelaide side without Tony Modra, [[Mark Ricciuto]] and goalsneak [[Peter Vardy (footballer)|Peter Vardy]] due to injury. However, the Crows again overcame a half-time deficit, kicking 14 second-half goals to win by 31 points, 19.11 (125) to 13.16 (94). [[Darren Jarman]] kicked six goals, five of which came in the last quarter, whilst utility [[Shane Ellen]] kicked a career-best five and [[Troy Bond]] kicked four. [[Andrew McLeod]], who gathered 31 possessions across half-back and in the midfield, won the [[Norm Smith Medal]] for the best player on-field in the Grand Final. The win is arguably one of the finest moments in South Australian sporting history.\n\nFew expected the Crows to successfully defend their premiership the following year. Adelaide often struggled in close matches during the [[1998 AFL season]]; seven of their nine losses were by 13 points or less, compared to only three wins by corresponding margins (they finished the regular season fifth on the ladder, with a record of 13-9). The Crows were well beaten by [[Melbourne Demons|Melbourne]] in the qualifying final at the [[MCG]] by 48 points, and at the time, looked far from a premiership threat. Since season 2000, a loss in the finals by a team outside the top four would result in instant elimination, but the Crows benefited from a quirk in the McIntyre finals system that was in use during the 90's and still progressed to the second week, drawn to play a semi final against the [[Sydney Swans]] at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]]. The Crows bounced back from their disappointing first finals loss and recorded a comprehensive upset 27-point win against the Swans in the wet, which set up a Preliminary Final rematch against the Western Bulldogs. Despite going into the match as underdogs, the Crows played some of their best football of the year to soundly beat the Dogs by 68 points - 24.17 (161) to 13.15 (93). It was a complete contrast to the thriller that took place the previous year, with [[Matthew Robran]] kicking six goals and [[Andrew McLeod]], opposed to renowned tagger [[Tony Liberatore]], booting seven.\n\nLike the previous year, Adelaide went into the [[1998 AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] as underdogs, playing against {{AFL Nor}}, who had won the premiership in 1996 and had won eleven consecutive matches leading up to the Grand Final. North Melbourne led by 24 points at half-time, 6.15 (51) to 4.3 (27), with only their inaccurate goalkicking keeping Adelaide in the contest. However, as they had in the previous year, Adelaide dominated the second half to win by 35 points, 15.15 (105) to 8.22 (70). [[Darren Jarman]] kicked five goals, while [[Andrew McLeod]] won his second successive Norm Smith Medal, an unprecedented feat. Club legend [[Mark Ricciuto]] won the Crows' Club Champion award in 1998. Following a disappointing year in [[1999 AFL season|1999]], premiership coach [[Malcolm Blight]] resigned from the role and the Crows entered the new [[millennium]] with two premierships under their belt.\n\n===2000s: Finals and near misses===\nThe Crows next made the finals in [[2001 AFL season]], this after losing their opening three matches for the season. Adelaide played fifth-placed {{AFL Car}} at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] in the First Elimination Final and were roundly defeated, 17.16 (118) to 6.14 (50). High-profile forward [[Darren Jarman]] announced his retirement after the match. Adelaide's impressive [[2002 AFL season]] (in which they achieved a 15\u20137 win-loss record) came undone at the penultimate stage, losing the Collingwood in the Preliminary Final at the MCG. [[Ben Hart]] won his second Malcolm Blight Medal in 2002, with [[Tyson Edwards]] finishing runner-up. [[Brett Burton]] led the Crows' goalkickers with 51. Hart and [[Mark Ricciuto]] were both named as All-Australians. Adelaide then extracted some revenge by defeating Collingwood in the [[2003 Wizard Home Loans Cup|pre-season competition]] in [[2003 AFL season|2003]], a first win of its kind for the club. The Crows' impressive 2003 season was eventually halted by the {{AFL BL}} at [[the Gabba]] in the semi-finals. That season Adelaide captain [[Mark Ricciuto]] became the first Crow to win the [[Brownlow Medal]] for the best and fairest player in the AFL in a three-way tie with [[Adam Goodes]] and [[Nathan Buckley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.droppunt.com/brownlow2003.htm |title=Brownlow Medal 2003 - 2003 Brownlow won by Nathan Buckley, Adam Goodes and Mark Ricciuto |publisher=Droppunt.com |accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref> The Crows returned to finals in [[2005 AFL season|2005]] and recorded a famous win in what to this day remains the only [[Showdown (AFL)|Showdown]] match against rivals {{AFL PA}} in the semi-finals. They then lost once more at the penultimate stage (preliminary final), to [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] at [[Subiaco Oval]] by 16 points. This was a feat the club unfortunately repeated in [[2006 AFL season|2006]] when they again lost to West Coast in the preliminary final, this time at home and by an even smaller margin.\n\nRemarkably, Adelaide went on to qualify for finals for each of the remaining seasons in the 2000s, falling short at the elimination or semi-final on each occasion. [[Collingwood FC|Collingwood]] proved to be the most obvious of villains, knocking the Crows out of the finals race successively in [[2008 AFL season|2008]] and [[2009 AFL season|2009]]. [[Andrew McLeod]] and [[Bernie Vince]] won club best and fairest awards in that time.\n\n'''Adelaide's [[AFL finals series|finals]] runs in the 2000s'''\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Year\n!Lost in\n!Opponent\n!Margin of defeat\n|-\n|[[2001 AFL season|2001]]\n| Elimination Final\n| {{AFL Car}}\n| 68 points\n|-\n|[[2002 AFL season|2002]]\n| Preliminary Final\n| {{AFL Col}}\n| 28 points\n|-\n|[[2003 AFL season|2003]]\n| Semi Final\n| {{AFL BL}}\n| 42 points\n|-\n|[[2005 AFL season|2005]]\n| Preliminary Final\n| {{AFL WCE}}\n| 16 points\n|-\n|[[2006 AFL season|2006]]\n| Preliminary Final\n| {{AFL WCE}}\n| 10 points\n|-\n|[[2007 AFL season|2007]]\n| Elimination Final\n| {{AFL Haw}}\n| 3 points\n|-\n|[[2008 AFL season|2008]]\n| Elimination Final\n| {{AFL Col}}\n| 31 points\n|-\n|[[2009 AFL season|2009]]\n| Semi Final\n| {{AFL Col}}\n| 5 points\n|}\n\n===2010s: Rebuilding and tragedy===\nAdelaide had a disastrous start to the [[2010 AFL season|2010 season]], losing their first six matches of the home and away season. They did recover to some extent in the back half of the year, finishing 11th with nine wins and thirteen losses, the first time under coach [[Neil Craig]] that the team did not make the finals. The season marked a turning point, with the likes of McLeod, [[Simon Goodwin]] and fellow stars [[Brett Burton]], [[Tyson Edwards]] and [[Trent Hentschel]] all announcing their retirements during the season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tyson Edwards walks out on Crows|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/crows-tyson-edwards-hangs-up-boots/story-e6frf9jf-1225872192988|last=Rucci|first=Michelangelo|last2=AAP|date=27 May 2010|publisher=Herald Sun|website=Herald Sun}}</ref> Long-term defender and club stalwart [[Nathan Bock]] announced he was leaving the club to join new side {{AFL GC}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/nathan-bock-admits-suns-offer/story-e6frf9jf-1225906104054|title=Nathan Bock confirms Gold Coast move|last=Capel|first=Andrew|date=26 August 2010|publisher=Herald Sun|website=Herald Sun}}</ref> These changes led to a disastrous [[2011 AFL season|2011 campaign]], which proved to be the worst season in the club's history. After a 103-point loss to fading champions {{AFL StK}}, the club's longest-serving coach [[Neil Craig]] stepped down, handing the reins to assistant coach and former premiership captain [[Mark Bickley]] as caretaker for the remainder of the season.<ref name=\"craig quits\">{{cite news |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |title=Neil Craig quits as Adelaide Crows coach |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/neil-craig-quits-as-adelaide-crows-coach-20110725-1hwmh.html |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=25 July 2011}}</ref> Under Bickley the club won three of their next four games, but lost their final two to {{AFL Ric}} and {{AFL WC}}, finishing in 14th place with 7 wins and 15 losses, both club worsts. [[Scott Thompson (footballer born 1983)|Scott Thompson]] won the Malcolm Blight Medal (best and fairest award) for the season. New coach [[Brenton Sanderson]] began his era at the club with a pre-season premiership in [[2012 NAB Cup|2012]] and followed up that success with an above-expectations [[2012 AFL season|regular season]]; the Crows finishing 17-5 and never once losing consecutive matches. Adelaide eventually qualified to face [[minor premiers]] {{AFL Haw}} at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] in the First Preliminary Final. Hawthorn led for most of the match and despite Adelaide taking the lead with five minutes remaining, the Hawks responded to win the match by five points, yet another heartbreaking finals series loss for the Crows. Adelaide would then fall under the weight of expectations to some degree in the [[2013 AFL season|2013]] and [[2014 AFL season|2014]] seasons, narrowly missing the top 8 on both occasions. This led to Sanderson being sacked at the end of the 2014 season. The club moved home matches to the newly redeveloped [[Adelaide Oval]] at the start of the 2014 season, though to this day the Crows retain their training and administrative headquarters at their old home stadium, [[Football Park]].\n\n====2012: Scandal and Investigation====\nAt the end of 2012, it was revealed that Adelaide had been found guilty of breaching the salary cap and tampering with the draft.

The jumper is worn with navy shorts at all home and away games, except for away [[Showdown (AFL)|Showdowns]], where it is paired with white shorts. It has had minor variations through its history since debuting with the club in 1991, including adding a white outline to the numbers in 1996, and the removal of yellow cuffs and addition of navy blue panels down the sides (due to manufacturers template design) in 2006. In 2009 the yellow cuffs and full hoops returned. In 2010 the hoops were cut off again at the sides. For 2016, the club removed the side panels, returning to the full hoops of the original design. The original base design/idea has never changed in the club's 27-year history.<ref>http://footyjumpers.com/adelaidehome.htm</ref>\n\n;Clash guernsey\nThe '''''clash''''' guernsey is a predominantly white based design,<ref>http://footyjumpers.com/images/Adelaide-Clash-2017.gif</ref> worn in away games where the standard home guernsey may cause a clash of colours with the home team. It features three hoops around the sternum in the club's colours of red, yellow and navy blue, and is always worn with white shorts. The current clash guernsey was introduced in 2016, and is more similar to the home strip than those of previous years.\n\n====Past====\nIn previous seasons, the Crows have had variations of alternate guernseys.\n\n;Pre-season guernsey (1996\u201398)\nThe club briefly used an alternate design in the pre-season competition. It was still in the club colours, but featured the club logo prominently on the front and continuing over onto the back.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adelaide Pre-Season Jumpers|url=http://footyjumpers.com/adelaidePS.htm|website=FootyJumpers.com|accessdate=15 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908064940/http://footyjumpers.com/adelaidePS.htm|archivedate=8 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n;Away guernsey (1999\u20132009)\nThe away guernsey was originally intended for use in all matches designated as away games, except finals. The design had changed several times over the years since it was first used in 1999.<ref name=\"footyjumpers.com\">{{cite web|title=Adelaide Away Jumpers|url=http://footyjumpers.com/adelaideaway.htm|website=FootyJumpers.com|accessdate=15 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908065833/http://footyjumpers.com/adelaideaway.htm|archivedate=8 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> From 2006 the red was removed from the top of the guernsey, moving it closer to the home guernsey. Its usage had waned since the introduction of the \"clash\" guernsey, to the point where it was only used twice in 2007, against the [[Western Bulldogs]] in round 2 and [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] in round 22. In a few away matches that year, the club also continued to use the traditional \"home\" guernsey, something which had rarely been done since the away strip was introduced. In response to this, a new away guernsey was introduced in 2008 featuring more red and yellow with a flying crow on the front \u2013 similar in design to the mid-90s pre-season jumper.\n\n;Clash guernsey (2006\u20132012)\n\nThe clash guernsey was first introduced for season 2006 and was radically different from the \"home\" and \"away\" designs at the time.<ref name=\"footyjumpers.com\"/> It was worn at all away games where the AFL deemed there to be a clash with the home team's guernsey design. Those clubs officially on the \"clash list\" included [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]], [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]], [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] and [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]]. Despite this, the AFL forced the club to wear it against other teams, such as [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] in 2007, [[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] in 2008 and the [[Brisbane Lions]] in 2008 and 2009. The first clash guernsey was red, and was worn from 2006\u20132009. The club first adopted a white clash guernsey in 2010, which is worn in the majority of away games, meaning the traditional home jumper was rarely worn away from home. It featured the club logo on the front with stylised curves in club colours on the front and back with navy stripes down the sides. The design has been changed a number of times over the years, but has remained predominately white. The club now wears the clash guernsey in away games against all clubs aside from the [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]], [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] football clubs.\n\n; Alternative guernsey (2016-2017)\n\nThe '''''alternative''''' guernsey was the same design as the current clash guernsey, but with a gold base instead of white.<ref>http://footyjumpers.com/images/Adelaide-Alt-2017.gif</ref> It was worn in away games in which it provided a greater contrast with the home team than either the home or white clash guernseys. Those teams were [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne,]] [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton,]] [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] and [[Western Bulldogs]] football clubs. It was always worn with white shorts.\n\n==Membership base and sponsorship==\nIn 2006, the club made history becoming the first club in VFL/AFL history to have more than 50,000 members. They broke that record in 2007, signing up 50,146 members after only round one of the season. The club failed to continue this record run and subsequently signed 48,720 members in 2008. The club has enjoyed a long-standing partnership with the [[Toyota]] brand since its inception, leading the club to be known in promotional materials as the \"Camry Crows\".\n\nTwo-time Grand Slam tennis champion [[Lleyton Hewitt]] has been the club's number one ticket holder since December 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://footystats.freeservers.com/Archive/D-03-Dec-01.html |title=Stab kicks |access-date=29 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517215906/http://footystats.freeservers.com/Archive/D-03-Dec-01.html |archive-date=17 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Federal politician [[Kate Ellis]] is the number 1 female ticket holder and [[Greg Champion]], a musician and radio broadcaster, is the Melbourne number 1 ticket holder.<ref>[http://www.afc.com.au/staff%20members/tabid/4517/default.aspx Recruiting Operatives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512223607/http://www.afc.com.au/staff%20members/tabid/4517/default.aspx |date=12 May 2012 }}</ref> Australian golfer [[Adam Scott (golfer)|Adam Scott]] is also an honorary member of the club.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/golf-can-wait-as-scott-jumps-on-the-crows-bandwagon/2005/08/21/1124562752901.html Golf can wait as Scott jumps on the Crows' bandwagon - AFL - Sport - smh.com.au]</ref>\n\n==Season figures==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | Membership\n! colspan=\"4\" | AFL\n! colspan=\"4\" | AFL Women's\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Ladder finish\n! colspan=\"2\" | Average home crowd\n! colspan=\"2\" | Ladder finish\n! colspan=\"2\" | Average home crowd\n|-\n!
