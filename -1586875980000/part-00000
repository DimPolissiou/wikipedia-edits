In 892, [[Ismail Samani]] (892\u2013907) united the Samanid state under one ruler, thus effectively putting an end to the [[feudal]] system used by the Samanids. It was also under him that the Samanids became independent of Abbasid authority.\n\nThe Samanid Empire is part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], which saw the creation of a [[Persianate society|Persianate]] culture and identity that brought Iranian speech and traditions into the fold of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].

The original home of the Samanids is unclear, for some [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] texts claim that the name was derived from a village near [[Samarkand]], while others assert it was a village near [[Balkh]] or [[Termez|Tirmidh]]. The latter is more probable since the earliest appearance of the Samanid family appears to be in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] rather than [[Transoxiana]].<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\">{{cite book|last1=Frye|first1=Richard N.|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=136}}</ref> In some sources the Samanids claimed to be descended from the noble [[House of Mihran|Mihran family]] of [[Bahram Chobin]], whereas one author claimed that they belonged to the Turkish Oghuz tribe, although this is most unlikely.<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\"/> Originally a [[Zoroastrian]], Saman Khuda converted to [[Islam]] during the governorship of [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]],{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} and named his oldest son as [[Asad ibn Saman|Asad]] in the governor's honour.{{sfn|Gibb|1986|p=685}} In 819, the governor of Khorasan, [[Ghassan ibn Abbad]], rewarded the four sons of Asad for their aid against the rebel [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]; [[Nuh ibn Asad|Nuh]] received [[Samarkand]]; [[Ahmad ibn Asad|Ahmad]] received [[Farghana]]; [[Yahya ibn Asad|Yahya]] received [[Tashkent|Shash]]; and [[Ilyas ibn Asad|Ilyas]] received [[Herat]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} This marked the beginning of the Samanid dynasty.\n\n===Rise===\n\n====The Samanid branch in Herat (819\u2013857)====\n\nIlyas died in 856, and was succeeded by his son [[Ibrahim ibn Ilyas]]\u2014the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirid]] governor of Khorasan, [[Muhammad ibn Tahir]], thereafter appointed him as the commander of his army, and sent him on an expedition against the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarid]] ruler [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar]] in [[Sistan]]. He was defeated at a battle near [[Pushang]] in 857, and fled to [[Nishapur]], where he was captured by Ya'qub al-Saffar and sent to Sistan as a hostage.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} The Tahirids thereafter assumed direct control over Herat.\n\n====The Samanid branches in Transoxiana (819\u2013892)====\n{{See Also|Samanid Civil War of 888}}\n[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]].]]\nIn 839/40, Nuh seized [[Isfijab]] from the nomadic [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Oghuz Turks|Turks]] living in the [[steppe]]. He thereafter had a wall constructed around the city to protect it from their attacks. He died in 841/2\u2014his two brothers Yahya and Ahmad were then appointed as the joint rulers of the city by the Tahirid governor of Khorasan.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} After Yahya's death in 855, Ahmad took control over Ch\u00e2ch, thus becoming the ruler of most of [[Transoxiana]]. He died in 864/5; his son [[Nasr I]] received Farghana and Samarkand, while his other son [[Ya'qub ibn Ahmad|Ya'qub]] received Ch\u00e2ch (areas around modern Tashkent/Chachkent).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Meanwhile, the Tahirids' authority had significantly weakened after suffering several defeats by the Saffarid ruler Ya'qub al-Saffar, thus losing their grip over the Samanids, who became more or less independent. Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Regardless, the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself. He thereafter forced the Abbasid caliph to recognize him as the ruler of those territories. In the spring of 900, he [[Battle of Balkh|clashed]] with Ismail near [[Balkh]], but was defeated and taken to captivity. Ismail thereafter sent him Baghdad, where he was executed.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Ismail was thereafter recognized as the ruler of all of Khorasan and Transoxiana by the caliph.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Furthermore, he also received the investiture over [[Tabaristan]], [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] and [[Isfahan]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} It was also during this period that the Afrighid dynasty was forced into submission.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}}\n\nBefore his major victory against the Saffarids, he had made various expeditions in Transoxiana; in 892, he put an end to the [[Principality of Ushrusana]] by seizing all of its lands. During the same period, he put an end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara. In 893, he invaded the territories of the [[Karluk Turks]], taking [[Taraz|Talas]] and converting the [[Church of the East|Nestorian church]] there into a [[mosque]].<ref>Renee Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia'', Transl.

The invasion was successful; Muhammad ibn Zayd was killed and Tabaristan was conquered by the Samanids. However, Muhammad ibn Harun shortly revolted, forcing Ismail himself to invade the region the following year. Muhammad ibn Harun thereafter fled to [[Daylam]], while Ismail reconquered Tabaristan and Gorgan.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}} In 901, [[Amr ibn al-Layth|Amr Saffari]] was defeated at the battle of Balkh by the Samanids, which reduced the Saffarid dynasty to a minor tributary in Sistan.{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=35}} It was during this period that the Samanids were at their height of power, ruling as far as [[Qazvin]] in the west<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/esmail-b-ahmad-b-asad-samani |title=ESM\u0100\u02bf\u012aL, b.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand went unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the walls--earlier strong, but now falling apart--were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under his paternal grand-uncle, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma'ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of [[tuberculosis]] after a few months.<ref>''A new text on Ismailism at the Samanid court'', Patricia Crone and Luke Treadwell, '''Texts, documents, and artefacts:Islamic Studies in Honour of D.S. Richards''', ed. Chase F. Robinson, (Brill, 2003), 46.</ref>\n\nRight when Nuh I ascended the throne, a revolt erupted in Khwarazm, which he managed to suppress. Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen Abu Ali Chaghani received the news of the re-capture of Bukhara, he once again marched towards it, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}} and its capital sacked.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149\u2013151}} Another battle shortly ensued between Abu 'Ali Chaghani and a Samanid army in [[Tukharistan]], which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu Ali Chaghani, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of [[Khuttal]], and the Kumiji [[mountain people]], but in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son [[Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah]] as hostage to Bukhara.{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764\u2013766}}\n[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Iran]] in the mid-10th century.]]\n[[Alp Tigin]], nominal vassal of the Samanids, conquered Ghazna in 962 from the Lawik dynasty.<ref>He dispossessed an indigenous family who had ruled in [[Ghazni]], the Lawiks (?), and following him a series of slave commanders, ruled there as nominal vassals of the Samanids; they struck coins but placed the names of the Samanids on them</ref><ref>Gard\u012bz\u012b, ed. \u1e24ab\u012bb\u012b, pp. 161\u201362; J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b, \u1e6cabaq\u0101t, I, pp. 226\u201327; Ne\u1e93\u0101m-al-Molk, pp. 142\u201358; \u0160ab\u0101nk\u0101ra\u02be\u012b, pp. 29\u201334; Bosworth, 1965, pp. 16\u201321</ref> The fifth of these commanders was Seb\u00fcktigin, who governed \u1e20azna for twenty years till 387 AH/997 CE with the title (as it appears from his tomb inscription<ref>Flury, pp. 62\u201363</ref>) of al-\u1e25\u0101jeb al-ajall (most noble commander).

With the weakened Samanids facing rising challenges from the [[Karakhanid]]s for control of [[Transoxiana]], Seb\u00fck later took control of all the provinces south of the Oxus and established the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]].\n\nIn 992, a [[Kara-Khanid dynasty|Karakhanid]], Harun Bughra Khan, grandson of the paramount tribal chief of the [[Karluks|Karluk]] confederation [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan]], captured [[Bukhara]], the Samanid capital.<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{citation|last=Davidovich|first=E.

In 999, Nasr b. Ali, a nephew of Harun, returned and took possession of Bukhara, meeting little resistance. The Samanid domains were split up between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana; the [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\n===Isma'il Muntasir's attempt to resurrect the Samanid state (1000\u20131005)===\n[[File:Isma'il Muntasir.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Artwork of [[Isma'il Muntasir]] in a battle.]]\n[[Isma'il Muntasir]] was the youngest son of Nuh II\u2014he was imprisoned by the Karakhanids after their conquest of Bukhara in 999. Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally. In political terms, it saw an effective break up of the Abbasid power and the rise of several successor states such as the Samanids and Buyids while in cultural terms, it witnessed the rise of new Persian as an administrative and literary language.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OeiKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR19&dq=Medieval+Central+Asia+and+the+Persianate+World,+A.C.S.+Peacock,+D.G.+Tor,+Iranian+Intermezzo#v=onepage&q=Medieval%20Central%20Asia%20and%20the%20Persianate%20World,%20A.C.S.%20Peacock,%20D.G.%20Tor,%20Iranian%20Intermezzo&f=true|title=Medieval Central Asia and the Persianate World: Iranian Tradition and Islamic Civilisation|last=Peacock|first=A.

The main responsibility of both governors and local rulers was to collect taxes and support the Samanid ruler with troops if needed. The most important province in the Samanid Empire was Khorasan, which was initially given to a relative of the Samanid ruler or a local Iranian prince (such as the [[Muhtajids]]), but was later given to one of his most trusted slaves. The governor of Khorasan was normally the ''[[sipah-salar]]'' (commander-in-chief).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\nLike in the Abbasid Caliphate, Turkic slaves could rise to high office in the Samanid state, which would sometimes give them enough power to nearly make the ruler their puppet.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\n====The nature of political authority under the Samanids====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Cultural and religious efforts===\n\n\nThe Samanids revived [[Persian culture]] by patronizing [[Rudaki]],<ref>\"Mihragan\", J.

Following the first complete translation of the [[Qur'an]] into Persian, during the 9th century, populations under the Samanid empire began accepting Islam in significant numbers.<ref>Michael Dillon, ''Xinjiang: China's Muslim far Northwest'', (RoutledgeCurzon, 2004), 11.</ref>\n\nThrough zealous missionary work as many as 30,000 tents of [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] came to profess Islam and later under the Ghaznavids more than 55,000 under the [[Hanafi]] school of thought. The mass conversion of the Turks to Islam eventually led to a growing influence of the [[Ghaznavids]], who would later rule the region.\n\nAgriculture and trading were the economic bases of the Samanid State. The Samanids were heavily involved in trading&nbsp;\u2013 even with Europe, as thousands of Samanid coins that have been found in the Baltic and Scandinavian countries testify.<ref>History of Bukhara, By Narshakhi trans. Richard N. Frye, pg. 143</ref>\n\nAnother lasting contribution of the Samanids to the history of Islamic art is the pottery known as Samanid Epigraphic Ware: plates, bowls, and pitchers fired in a white slip and decorated only with calligraphy, often elegantly and rhythmically written.  The Arabic phrases used in this calligraphy are generally more or less generic well wishes, or Islamic admonitions to good table manners.\n\n===Scholarship===\n\n====Avicenna and Abu Rayhan al-Biruni====\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:The Sasanian King Khusraw and Courtiers in a Garden, Page from a manuscript of the Shahnama (Book of Kings) of Firdawsi, late 15th-early 16th century.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Khosrow II]] and his courtiers in a garden'', page from a manuscript of the [[Shahnameh]], late 15th-early 16th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, there was a large amount of growth in literature, mostly in poetry. It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxiana and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most-favored language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Fewer than 2,000 lines of his poetry have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse form of medieval Persian poetry: mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, a special interest arose in ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age was Ferdowsi, born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud. However, his work was not as appreciated by the Ghaznavids as it had been by the Samanids.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Population===\nUnder the Samanid Empire, the [[Zarafshan]] valley, [[Qashqadaryo Region|Kashka Darya]] and [[Usrushana]] were populated by [[Sogdia]]ns; [[Tukharistan]] by the Bactrians; [[Khwarezm]] by the Khwarazmians; the [[Fergana Valley|Ferghana valley]] by the Ferghanans; southern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by Khorasanians; and the [[Pamir mountains]] and environs by the [[Saka]] and other early Iranian peoples.

The original home of the Samanids is unclear, for some [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] texts claim that the name was derived from a village near [[Samarkand]], while others assert it was a village near [[Balkh]] or [[Termez|Tirmidh]]. The latter is more probable since the earliest appearance of the Samanid family appears to be in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] rather than [[Transoxiana]].<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\">{{cite book|last1=Frye|first1=Richard N.|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=136}}</ref> In some sources the Samanids claimed to be descended from the noble [[House of Mihran|Mihran family]] of [[Bahram Chobin]], whereas one author claimed that they belonged to the Turkish Oghuz tribe, although this is most unlikely.<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\"/> Originally a [[Zoroastrian]], Saman Khuda converted to [[Islam]] during the governorship of [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]],{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} and named his oldest son as [[Asad ibn Saman|Asad]] in the governor's honour.{{sfn|Gibb|1986|p=685}} In 819, the governor of Khorasan, [[Ghassan ibn Abbad]], rewarded the four sons of Asad for their aid against the rebel [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]; [[Nuh ibn Asad|Nuh]] received [[Samarkand]]; [[Ahmad ibn Asad|Ahmad]] received [[Farghana]]; [[Yahya ibn Asad|Yahya]] received [[Tashkent|Shash]]; and [[Ilyas ibn Asad|Ilyas]] received [[Herat]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} This marked the beginning of the Samanid dynasty.\n\n===Rise===\n\n====The Samanid branch in Herat (819\u2013857)====\n\nIlyas died in 856, and was succeeded by his son [[Ibrahim ibn Ilyas]]\u2014the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirid]] governor of Khorasan, [[Muhammad ibn Tahir]], thereafter appointed him as the commander of his army, and sent him on an expedition against the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarid]] ruler [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar]] in [[Sistan]]. He was defeated at a battle near [[Pushang]] in 857, and fled to [[Nishapur]], where he was captured by Ya'qub al-Saffar and sent to Sistan as a hostage.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} The Tahirids thereafter assumed direct control over Herat.\n\n====The Samanid branches in Transoxiana (819\u2013892)====\n{{See Also|Samanid Civil War of 888}}\n[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]].]]\nIn 839/40, Nuh seized [[Isfijab]] from the nomadic [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Oghuz Turks|Turks]] living in the [[steppe]]. He thereafter had a wall constructed around the city to protect it from their attacks. He died in 841/2\u2014his two brothers Yahya and Ahmad were then appointed as the joint rulers of the city by the Tahirid governor of Khorasan.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} After Yahya's death in 855, Ahmad took control over Ch\u00e2ch, thus becoming the ruler of most of [[Transoxiana]]. He died in 864/5; his son [[Nasr I]] received Farghana and Samarkand, while his other son [[Ya'qub ibn Ahmad|Ya'qub]] received Ch\u00e2ch (areas around modern Tashkent/Chachkent).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Meanwhile, the Tahirids' authority had significantly weakened after suffering several defeats by the Saffarid ruler Ya'qub al-Saffar, thus losing their grip over the Samanids, who became more or less independent. Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Regardless, the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand went unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the walls--earlier strong, but now falling apart--were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under his paternal grand-uncle, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma'ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of [[tuberculosis]] after a few months.<ref>''A new text on Ismailism at the Samanid court'', Patricia Crone and Luke Treadwell, '''Texts, documents, and artefacts:Islamic Studies in Honour of D.S.

Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen Abu Ali Chaghani received the news of the re-capture of Bukhara, he once again marched towards it, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}} and its capital sacked.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149\u2013151}} Another battle shortly ensued between Abu 'Ali Chaghani and a Samanid army in [[Tukharistan]], which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu Ali Chaghani, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of [[Khuttal]], and the Kumiji [[mountain people]], but in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son [[Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah]] as hostage to Bukhara.{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764\u2013766}}\n[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Iran]] in the mid-10th century.]]\n[[Alp Tigin]], nominal vassal of the Samanids, conquered Ghazna in 962 from the Lawik dynasty.<ref>He dispossessed an indigenous family who had ruled in [[Ghazni]], the Lawiks (?), and following him a series of slave commanders, ruled there as nominal vassals of the Samanids; they struck coins but placed the names of the Samanids on them</ref><ref>Gard\u012bz\u012b, ed. \u1e24ab\u012bb\u012b, pp. 161\u201362; J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b, \u1e6cabaq\u0101t, I, pp. 226\u201327; Ne\u1e93\u0101m-al-Molk, pp. 142\u201358; \u0160ab\u0101nk\u0101ra\u02be\u012b, pp. 29\u201334; Bosworth, 1965, pp. 16\u201321</ref> The fifth of these commanders was Seb\u00fcktigin, who governed \u1e20azna for twenty years till 387 AH/997 CE with the title (as it appears from his tomb inscription<ref>Flury, pp. 62\u201363</ref>) of al-\u1e25\u0101jeb al-ajall (most noble commander).

Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally. In political terms, it saw an effective break up of the Abbasid power and the rise of several successor states such as the Samanids and Buyids while in cultural terms, it witnessed the rise of new Persian as an administrative and literary language.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OeiKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR19&dq=Medieval+Central+Asia+and+the+Persianate+World,+A.C.S.+Peacock,+D.G.+Tor,+Iranian+Intermezzo#v=onepage&q=Medieval%20Central%20Asia%20and%20the%20Persianate%20World,%20A.C.S.%20Peacock,%20D.G.%20Tor,%20Iranian%20Intermezzo&f=true|title=Medieval Central Asia and the Persianate World: Iranian Tradition and Islamic Civilisation|last=Peacock|first=A.

The main responsibility of both governors and local rulers was to collect taxes and support the Samanid ruler with troops if needed. The most important province in the Samanid Empire was Khorasan, which was initially given to a relative of the Samanid ruler or a local Iranian prince (such as the [[Muhtajids]]), but was later given to one of his most trusted slaves. The governor of Khorasan was normally the ''[[sipah-salar]]'' (commander-in-chief).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\nLike in the Abbasid Caliphate, Turkic slaves could rise to high office in the Samanid state, which would sometimes give them enough power to nearly make the ruler their puppet.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\n====The nature of political authority under the Samanids====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Cultural and religious efforts===\n\n\nThe Samanids revived [[Persian culture]] by patronizing [[Rudaki]],<ref>\"Mihragan\", J.

Richard N.

It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxiana and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most-favored language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Fewer than 2,000 lines of his poetry have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse form of medieval Persian poetry: mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, a special interest arose in ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age was Ferdowsi, born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud.

An outstanding library known as ''Siw\u0101n al-hikma'' (\"Storehouse of Wisdom\") was put together in Bukhara, known for its various types of books.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=94}}\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:Two Bowls with Figures and a Footed Plate with Birds MET DP258911.jpg|thumb|Example of figural earthenware ceramics from Samanid period.]]\n\n==== Crafts ====\n[[File:Bowl with Arabic Inscription.jpg|thumb|Bowl with Arabic Inscription]]\nDue to extensive excavations at [[Nishapur]], Iran in the mid-twentieth century, Samanid pottery is well-represented in Islamic art collections around the world.

It has a white slip with black slip decoration under a transparent glaze. There is calligraphic decoration all around the bowl. It is elongated at some points and compressed in other areas of the letter to the point where it almost looks abstract. Right in the center of the bowl is a black dot. If the bowl is looked at closely there are cracks and marks that have occurred over time. What would once have been a white bowl is now stained yellow in some areas. The calligraphy looks well thought out and planned. Each letter is well spaced, and the whole saying fits perfectly around the bowl. This may be because the artists used to practice beforehand on paper. The saying translates to \u201cPlanning before work protects you from regret; prosperity and peace\u201d\n\n===Economy===\n\n====Agriculture====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n====Mining====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}<br />\n\n====Material culture====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n====Domestic and external trade====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\nIn commending the Samanids, the epic Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]] says of them:\n\n<blockquote>\n\u06a9\u062c\u0627 \u0622\u0646 \u0628\u0632\u0631\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u0646<br/>\n\u0632 \u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0633\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u0646\n</blockquote>\n\n\"Where have all the great [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] gone?<br/>\nFrom the [[Bahram V of Persia|Bahr\u0101mids]] to the Samanids what has come upon?\"\n\nA Bukharian historian writing in 943 stated that [[Ismail Samani]]: <blockquote>\"was indeed worthy and right for [[padishah]]ship.

More than half of the 20,000 first edition (1972) entries were revised or updated and over 2,500 new entries were produced, together totaling 4.7 million new words. In addition, around 30,000 new bibliographical items were added. Among the renowned international scholars serving as editors were [[Michael Berenbaum]] (Holocaust, United States, as well as executive editor), Israel Prize laureates [[Menachem Elon]] (Jewish Law), Aviezer Ravitzky (Jewish Philosophy), [[Moshe Idel]] (Kabbalah and Hasidism), Jacob Landau (Islam and Muslim Countries), and Ziva Amishai Maisels (Art). [[Judith R. Baskin]] headed the entirely new Women and Gender division while Shamma Friedman oversaw the revamping of the Talmud division in accordance with the revolution in talmudic studies. [[Dina Porat]] (Antisemitism), [[Sergio DellaPergola]] (Demography), and [[Jonathan Sarna]] (United States) served as consulting editors. In its award citation the Dartmouth Committee called the new ''Judaica'' \"an authoritative, interdisciplinary and comprehensive examination of all aspects of Jewish life, history and culture.\"\nAmong other award-winning projects, Skolnik had also worked on ''[http://www.judaism.com/display.asp?etn=BAADG The New Encyclopedia of Judaism]'' (co-editor, 2002)<ref>Wigoder, G., Skolnik, F., & Himelstein, S.

The novel follows the lives of representational characters across the entire spectrum of Israeli society but focuses on two families \u2013 the Shachars, a kibbutz family, and the Goldsteins, representing the emerging Israeli middle class.

It unfolds in a dreamlike atmosphere where ancient and modern mythologies are woven together as the unnamed hero seeks to evade his pursuers and escape his destiny.\n\n===Basic Forms===\nSkolnik's third novel (Regal House, 2018) sets out to explore the mind of a protagonist who may or may not commit a mass shooting. As stated in the publisher's blurb: \"While the act is viewed through the prism of possibility, utilizing parallel sets of characters, images and motifs, and in technique the novel owes something to both Alain Robbe-Grillet and the music of Philip Glass, it was essentially inspired by Charles Whitman, the Texas sniper of the 1960s, and represents an attempt to elucidate the existential meaning of such an act at its deepest level.\"\n\n===Writing as Fred Russell===\nSkolnik also published two novels under his Fred Russell pen name in 2014: ''Rafi's World'' (Fomite Press), dealing with Israel's emerging criminal class, and ''The Links in the Chain'' (CCLaP), a thriller set in New York against an Arab-Israel background.

The mill is situated at the junction of the River Floss and the more minor River Ripple, near the village of St Ogg's in [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]].

Introduction to the Penguin Classics Edition, 1985.</ref> (In chapter 3, the character Mr Riley is described as an \"auctioneer and appraiser thirty years ago\", placing the opening events of the novel in approximately 1829, thirty years before the novel's composition in 1859. In chapter 8, Mr Tulliver and Mr Deane discuss the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] and his \"conduct in the Catholic Question\", a conversation that could only take place after 1828, when Wellington became [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] and supported a bill for Catholic Emancipation). The novel includes many autobiographical elements and reflects the disgrace that George Eliot ([[Mary Ann Evans]]) experienced while in a lengthy relationship with a married man, [[George Henry Lewes]].\n[[File:An idyllic location - geograph.org.uk - 894101.jpg|thumb|[[Bintry Watermill]], which depicted Dorlcote Mill in the 1997 TV series.]]\nMaggie Tulliver is the protagonist and the story begins when she is 9 years old, 13 years into her parents' marriage. Her relationship with her older brother Tom, and her romantic relationships with Philip Wakem (a hunchbacked, sensitive and intellectual friend) and with Stephen Guest (a vivacious young socialite in St Ogg's and assumed fianc\u00e9 of Maggie's cousin Lucy Deane) constitute the most significant narrative threads.\n\nTom and Maggie have a close yet complex bond, which continues throughout the novel. Their relationship is coloured by Maggie's desire to recapture the unconditional love of her father before his death. Tom's pragmatic and reserved nature clashes with Maggie's idealism and fervor for intellectual gains and experience. Various family crises, including bankruptcy, Mr Tulliver's rancorous relationship with Philip Wakem's father, which results in the loss of the mill and Mr Tulliver's untimely death, intensify Tom's and Maggie's differences and highlight their love for each other. To help his father repay his debts, Tom leaves school to enter a life of the business. He eventually finds a measure of success, restoring the family's former estate. Maggie languishes in the impoverished Tulliver home, her intellectual aptitude wasted in her socially isolated state. She passes through a period of tough spirituality, during which she renounces the world, motivated by her reading of [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]]'s [[The Imitation of Christ (book)|'' The Imitation of Christ'']].\n\nThis renunciation is tested by a renewed friendship with Philip Wakem, with whom she had developed a friendship while he and Tom were students. Against the wishes of Tom and her father - who both despise the Wakems - Maggie secretly meets with Philip and they go for long walks through the woods. The relationship they forge is founded partly in Maggie's heartfelt pity for broken and neglected human beings but it also serves as an outlet for her intellectual romantic desires. Philip's and Maggie's attraction is, in any case, inconsequential because of the family antipathy. Philip manages to coax a pledge of love from Maggie. When Tom discovers the relationship between the two, he forces his sister to renounce Philip, and with him her hopes of experiencing the broader, more cultured world he represents.\n\nSeveral years pass, during which Mr Tulliver dies. Lucy Deane invites Maggie to come and stay with her and experience the life of cultured leisure that she enjoys. This includes long hours conversing and playing music with Lucy's suitor, Stephen Guest, a prominent St Ogg's resident. Stephen and Maggie, against their rational judgments, become attracted to each other. The complication is compounded by Philip Wakem's friendship with Lucy and Stephen; he and Maggie are reintroduced and Philip's love for her is rekindled, while Maggie, no longer isolated, enjoys the clandestine attentions of Stephen Guest, putting her past profession of love for Philip in question. Lucy intrigues to throw Philip and Maggie together on a short rowing trip down the Floss but Stephen unwittingly takes a sick Philip's place. \n\nWhen Maggie and Stephen find themselves floating down the river, negligent of the distance they have covered, he proposes that they board a passing boat to the next substantial city, Mudport and get married. Maggie is too tired to argue about it. Stephen takes advantage of her weariness and hails the boat. They are taken on board and during the trip to Mudport, Maggie struggles between her love for Stephen and her duties to Philip and Lucy, which were established when she was poor, isolated and dependent on them for what good her life contained. Upon arrival in Mudport, she rejects Stephen and makes her way back to St Ogg's, where she lives for a brief period as an outcast, Stephen having fled to Holland. Although she immediately goes to Tom for forgiveness and shelter, he roughly sends her away, telling her that she will never again be welcome under his roof. Lucy and Philip forgive her, in a moving reunion and in an eloquent letter, respectively.\n\nMaggie's brief exile ends when the river floods. Having struggled through the waters in a boat to find Tom at the old mill, she sets out with him to rescue Lucy Deane and her family. In a brief tender moment, the brother and sister are reconciled from all past differences. When their boat capsizes, the two drown in an embrace, thus giving the book its Biblical epigraph: \"In their death, they were not divided\".<ref>2 Samuel I:23</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Tom and Maggie.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tom and Maggie Tulliver]]\n* Maggie Tulliver \u2013 a dark-complexioned miller's daughter.

A certain determinism is at play throughout the novel, from Mr Tulliver's grossly imprudent inability to keep himself from \"going to law\", and thereby losing his patrimony and bankrupting his family, to the series of events that sets Maggie and Stephen down the river and past the point of no return. Characters such as Mr Tulliver are presented as unable to determine their own course rationally, while various external forces, be it the drift of the river or the force of a flood, are presented as determining the courses of people for them. On the other hand, Maggie's ultimate choice not to marry Stephen, and to suffer both the privation of his love and the ignominy of their botched elopement demonstrates a final triumph of free will.\n\nCritics have asserted that Maggie's need for love and acceptance is her underlying motivation throughout ''The Mill on the Floss'', claiming that the conflicts that arise in the novel invariably stem from her frustrated attempts at gaining this acceptance. Alan Bellringer has claimed that  \"[t]he two main themes of the novel, growing up and falling in love, lend themselves to amusement, but it is stunted growth and frustrated love that are emphasized.\" Commentators have often focused on the constant rejection of Maggie's talents and mannerisms by her family and society. Even the cultural norms of her community deny her intellectual and spiritual growth. According to Elizabeth Ermarth, \"[t]hey are norms according to which she is an inferior, dependent creature who will never go far in anything, and which consequently are a denial of her full humanity.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ermarth|first=Elizabeth|date=1974|title=Maggie Tulliver's Long Suicide|url=|journal=SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500\u20131900|volume=14|pages=587\u2013601|via=Jstor}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe story was adapted as a film, ''[[The Mill on the Floss (film)|The Mill on the Floss]]'', in 1937, and as a BBC series in 1978 starring [[Christopher Blake]], [[Pippa Guard]], [[Judy Cornwell]], [[Ray Smith (actor)|Ray Smith]] and [[Anton Lesser]].\n\nA single-episode television adaptation of the novel first was aired on 1 January 1997.

A certain determinism is at play throughout the novel, from Mr Tulliver's grossly imprudent inability to keep himself from \"going to law\", and thereby losing his patrimony and bankrupting his family, to the series of events that sets Maggie and Stephen down the river and past the point of no return. Characters such as Mr Tulliver are presented as unable to determine their own course rationally, while various external forces, be it the drift of the river or the force of a flood, are presented as determining the courses of people for them. On the other hand, Maggie's ultimate choice not to marry Stephen, and to suffer both the privation of his love and the ignominy of their botched elopement demonstrates a final triumph of free will.\n\nCritics have asserted that Maggie's need for love and acceptance is her underlying motivation throughout ''The Mill on the Floss'', claiming that the conflicts that arise in the novel invariably stem from her frustrated attempts at gaining this acceptance. Alan Bellringer has claimed that  \"[t]he two main themes of the novel, growing up and falling in love, lend themselves to amusement, but it is stunted growth and frustrated love that are emphasized.\" Commentators have often focused on the constant rejection of Maggie's talents and mannerisms by her family and society. Even the cultural norms of her community deny her intellectual and spiritual growth. According to Elizabeth Ermarth, \"[t]hey are norms according to which she is an inferior, dependent creature who will never go far in anything, and which consequently are a denial of her full humanity.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ermarth|first=Elizabeth|date=1974|title=Maggie Tulliver's Long Suicide|url=|journal=SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500\u20131900|volume=14|pages=587\u2013601|via=Jstor}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe story was adapted as a film, ''[[The Mill on the Floss (film)|The Mill on the Floss]]'', in 1937, and as a BBC series in 1978 starring [[Christopher Blake]], [[Pippa Guard]], [[Judy Cornwell]], [[Ray Smith (actor)|Ray Smith]] and [[Anton Lesser]].\n\nA single-episode television adaptation of the novel first was aired on 1 January 1997.

'''Jane Marple''' is often characterized an elderly [[spinster]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mezel|first=Kathy|date=Winter 2007|title=Spinsters, Surveillance, and Speech: The Case of Miss Marple, Miss Mole, and Miss Jekyll|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4619330?seq=1|journal=Journal of Modern Literature|publisher=Indiana University Press|volume=30|issue=2|pages=103-120|jstor=4619330|via=JSTOR}}</ref><ref>[https://www.agathachristie.com/news/2018/facts-about-miss-marple agathachristie.com: Facts about Miss Marple]</ref> by academics and some reviewers. Christie's character lives in the village of [[St. Mary Mead]] and acts as an amateur consulting [[detective]]. She is one of the best known of Christie's characters and has been portrayed numerous times on screen. Her first appearance was in a short story published in ''[[The Royal Magazine]]'' in December 1927, \"[[The Tuesday Night Club]]\",<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Curran|title=Agatha Christie: Murder in the Making|location=New York|publisher=Harper|year=2011|isbn=978-0-06-206542-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/agathachristiemu0000curr/page/140 140]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/agathachristiemu0000curr/page/140}}</ref> which later became the first chapter of ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932). Her first appearance in a full-length novel was in ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' in 1930 and her last appearance was in ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' in 1976.\n\n==Origins==\nThe character of Miss Marple is based on friends of Christie's step grandmother/aunt (Margaret Miller, n\u00e9e West).<ref>Margaret West was the sister of Mary Ann Boehmer, Agatha Christie's maternal grandmother. Margaret married Christie's paternal grandfather, Nathaniel Frary Miller, in 1863 in Westbourne, West Sussex. He died in 1869 and she dedicated a stained glass window to his memory in St.John's Church, Main Road, Southbourne, West Sussex. Margaret's stepson, Frederick Miller, went on to marry her niece Clara, and Agatha was the result. {{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2957794/Agatha-Christie-used-her-grandmother-as-a-model-for-Miss-Marple-new-tapes-reveal.html|title=Agatha Christie used her step grandmother as a model for Miss Marple, new tapes reveal|first=Stephen|last=Adams|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2008-09-16}}</ref> Christie attributed the inspiration for the character of Miss Marple to a number of sources, stating that Miss Marple was \"the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my step grandmother's Ealing cronies \u2013 old ladies whom I have met in so many villages where I have gone to stay as a girl\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Christie|first=Agatha|title=An Autobiography|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-635328-7|page=449}}</ref> Christie also used material from her fictional creation, spinster Caroline Sheppard, who appeared in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]''. When [[Michael Morton (dramatist)|Michael Morton]] adapted the novel for the stage, he replaced the character of Caroline with a young girl. This change saddened Christie and she determined to give old maids a voice: Miss Marple was born.<ref name=\"agathachristie.com\">{{cite web|url=http://agathachristie.com/christies-work/detectives-and-sidekicks/miss-marple/|title=Characters \u2013 Miss Marple|work=Agatha Christie|accessdate=2012-10-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010144904/http://agathachristie.com/christies-work/detectives-and-sidekicks/miss-marple/|archivedate=10 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nChristie may have taken the name from [[Marple railway station]], through which she passed, or from Marple Hall, near her sister Madge's home at [[Abney Hall]].<ref name=\"Cheshire Life\">{{cite web | url=https://www.cheshirelife.co.uk/out-about/was-miss-marple-born-in-cheshire-1-1631050 | title=Was Miss Marple Born in Cheshire? | date=15 September 2010 | publisher=Cheshire Life | accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://www.poirot.us/mprofile.php \"Marple's Profile\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126123518/http://poirot.us/mprofile.php |date=26 November 2010 }}, Hercule Poirot Central, ''accessed 30 March 2009''.</ref>\n\n==Character==\nThe character of Jane Marple in the first Miss Marple book, ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'', is markedly different from how she appears in later books. This early version of Miss Marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman. The citizens of St. Mary Mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone. In later books, she becomes more modern and a kinder person.\n\nMiss Marple solves difficult crimes because of her shrewd intelligence, and St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature. Crimes always remind her of a parallel incident, although acquaintances may be bored by analogies that often lead her to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime. She also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand. In several stories, she is able to rely on her acquaintance with [[Sir Henry Clithering]], a retired commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]], for official information when required.\n\nMiss Marple never married and has no close living relatives. Her nephew, the \"well-known author\" Raymond West, appears in some stories, including ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'', ''Sleeping Murder'' and ''Ingots of Gold'' (which also feature his wife, Joyce Lempri\u00e8re). Raymond overestimates himself and underestimates his aunt's mental acuity. Miss Marple employs young women (including Clara, Emily, Alice, Esther, Gwenda, and Amy) from a nearby orphanage, whom she trains for service as general housemaids after the retirement of her long-time maid-housekeeper, faithful Florence. She was briefly looked after by her irritating companion, Miss Knight. In her later years, companion Cherry Baker, first introduced in ''The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side'', lives in.\n\nMiss Marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means, although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of Raymond West, her nephew (''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'', 1964). She is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home among them and would probably have been happy to describe herself as \"genteel\"; indeed, a ''[[gentlewoman]]''. Miss Marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of British detective fiction, the [[gentleman detective]]. She demonstrates a kys \nthorough education, including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers. In ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952), it is revealed that Miss Marple grew up in a [[cathedral close]], and that she studied at an Italian finishing school with Americans Ruth Van Rydock and Caroline \"Carrie\" Louise Serrocold.\n\nWhile Miss Marple is described as \"an old lady\" in many of the stories, her age is mentioned in \"At Bertram's Hotel\", where it is said she visited the hotel when she was fourteen and almost sixty years have passed since then. Excluding ''Sleeping Murder'', forty-one years passed between the first and last-written novels, and many characters grow and age. An example would be the Vicar's nephew: in ''The Murder at the Vicarage'', the Reverend Clement's nephew Dennis is a teenager; in ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side'', it is mentioned that the nephew is now grown and successful and has a career. The effects of ageing are seen on Miss Marple, such as needing a holiday after illness in ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' but she is if anything more agile in ''[[Nemesis (Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', set only sixteen months later.\n\nMiss Marple's background is described in some detail, albeit in glimpses across the novels and short stories in which she appears. She has a very large family, including a sister, the mother of [[Raymond West (character)|Raymond]] and Mabel Denham, a young woman who was accused of poisoning her husband Geoffrey (''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Thumb Mark of St. Peter|The Thumb Mark of St. Peter]]'').\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Miss Marple Series===\n# ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (1930, Novel)\n#''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932, Collection)\n#''[[The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories]]'' (1939, Collection)\n# ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (1942, Novel)\n# ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (1943, Novel)\n# ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (1950, Novel)\n# ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'' (1950, Collection)\n# ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952, Novel) - also published as Murder With Mirrors\n# ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (1953, Novel)\n# ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (1957, Novel) - also published as What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!\n# ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960, Collection)\n# ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]'' (1961, Collection)\n# ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]] (''1962, Novel)\n# ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (1964, Novel)\n# ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (1965, Novel)\n# ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (1971, Novel)\n# ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (1976, Novel)\n# ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories|Miss Marple's Final Cases]]'' (1979, Collection)\n\n===Miss Marple short story collections===\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'' (1932 short story collection featuring Miss Marple, also published as ''The Tuesday Club Murders'')\n* ''[[Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories]]'' (short stories collected posthumously, also published as ''Miss Marple's Final Cases'', but only six of the eight stories actually feature Miss Marple) (written between 1939 and 1954, published 1979)\n* ''Miss Marple: The Complete Short Stories'', published 1985, includes 20 from 4 sets: ''[[The Tuesday Club Murders]]'', ''[[The Regatta Mystery]]'', ''[[Three Blind Mice and Other Stories]]'', and ''[[Double Sin and Other Stories]]''.\n\nMiss Marple also appears in \"Greenshaw's Folly\", a short story included as part of the Poirot collection ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]'' (1960).

These were successful light comedies, but were disappointing to Christie herself.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia''. NY: Simon and Schuster, 2000. 386-87.\n{{ISBN|9780671028312}} \nbooks.google.com/books?id=R3syC8weGO8C&pg=PA386</ref> Nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' to Rutherford.\n\nRutherford presented the character as a bold and eccentric old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels. As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never worked for a living, but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook-housekeeper, a stage actress, a sailor and criminal reformer, and is offered the chance to run a riding establishment-cum-hotel. Her education and genteel background are hinted at when she mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing, and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).\n\n''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961, directed by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Rutherford. This film was based on the 1957 novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy is cut from the plot. Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. Actress [[Joan Hickson]], who played Marple in the 1984-1992 television adaptations, has a role as a housekeeper in ''[[Murder, She Said]]''.<ref name=\"celebration140\"/>\n\nThe other Rutherford films, all directed by Pollock, were ''[[Murder at the Gallop]]'' (1963), based on the 1953 [[Hercule Poirot]] novel ''[[After the Funeral]]'' (in this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for); ''[[Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1964). The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from ''They Do It With Mirrors'' (viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to [[The Mousetrap|''The Mousetrap''.]] Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the parodic Hercule Poirot adventure ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).\n\nThe music to all four films was composed and conducted by [[Ron Goodwin]]. The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations in each. The main theme has a distinct 1960s feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the [[violin]]. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by Pollock after Pollock had heard about him from [[Stanley Black]]. Black had worked with Pollock on \"Stranger in Town\" in 1957 and had previously used Goodwin as his orchestrator.\n\nRutherford, who was 68 years old when the first film was shot in February 1961, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband, [[Stringer Davis]], appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'. The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721192731/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple2/shoes.html|title=Filling Miss Marple's Shoes|first=Phil|last=Clymer|accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Angela Lansbury===\nIn 1980, [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's 1962 novel. The film featured an all-star cast that included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Kim Novak]]. [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork. Lansbury's Marple was a crisp, intelligent woman who moved stiffly and spoke in clipped tones. Unlike most incarnations of Miss Marple, this one smoked cigarettes.

a [[fictional character]] in [[Agatha Christie]]'s crime novels and short stories.

Christie's character lives in the village of [[St. Mary Mead]] and acts as an amateur consulting [[detective]].

Her first appearance in a full-length novel was in ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' in 1930 and her last appearance was in ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' in 1976.\n\n==Origins==\nThe character of Miss Marple is based on friends of Christie's step grandmother/aunt (Margaret Miller, n\u00e9e West).<ref>Margaret West was the sister of Mary Ann Boehmer, Agatha Christie's maternal grandmother. Margaret married Christie's paternal grandfather, Nathaniel Frary Miller, in 1863 in Westbourne, West Sussex. He died in 1869 and she dedicated a stained glass window to his memory in St.John's Church, Main Road, Southbourne, West Sussex. Margaret's stepson, Frederick Miller, went on to marry her niece Clara, and Agatha was the result. {{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2957794/Agatha-Christie-used-her-grandmother-as-a-model-for-Miss-Marple-new-tapes-reveal.html|title=Agatha Christie used her step grandmother as a model for Miss Marple, new tapes reveal|first=Stephen|last=Adams|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2008-09-16}}</ref> Christie attributed the inspiration for the character of Miss Marple to a number of sources, stating that Miss Marple was \"the sort of old lady who would have been rather like some of my step grandmother's Ealing cronies \u2013 old ladies whom I have met in so many villages where I have gone to stay as a girl\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Christie|first=Agatha|title=An Autobiography|year=2001|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-00-635328-7|page=449}}</ref> Christie also used material from her fictional creation, spinster Caroline Sheppard, who appeared in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]''. When [[Michael Morton (dramatist)|Michael Morton]] adapted the novel for the stage, he replaced the character of Caroline with a young girl. This change saddened Christie and she determined to give old maids a voice: Miss Marple was born.<ref name=\"agathachristie.com\">{{cite web|url=http://agathachristie.com/christies-work/detectives-and-sidekicks/miss-marple/|title=Characters \u2013 Miss Marple|work=Agatha Christie|accessdate=2012-10-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010144904/http://agathachristie.com/christies-work/detectives-and-sidekicks/miss-marple/|archivedate=10 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nChristie may have taken the name from [[Marple railway station]], through which she passed, or from Marple Hall, near her sister Madge's home at [[Abney Hall]].<ref name=\"Cheshire Life\">{{cite web | url=https://www.cheshirelife.co.uk/out-about/was-miss-marple-born-in-cheshire-1-1631050 | title=Was Miss Marple Born in Cheshire? | date=15 September 2010 | publisher=Cheshire Life | accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://www.poirot.us/mprofile.php \"Marple's Profile\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126123518/http://poirot.us/mprofile.php |date=26 November 2010 }}, Hercule Poirot Central, ''accessed 30 March 2009''.</ref>\n\n==Character==\nThe character of Jane Marple in the first Miss Marple book, ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'', is markedly different from how she appears in later books. This early version of Miss Marple is a gleeful gossip and not an especially nice woman. The citizens of St. Mary Mead like her but are often tired by her nosy nature and how she seems to expect the worst of everyone. In later books, she becomes more modern and a kinder person.\n\nMiss Marple solves difficult crimes because of her shrewd intelligence, and St. Mary Mead, over her lifetime, has given her seemingly infinite examples of the negative side of human nature. Crimes always remind her of a parallel incident, although acquaintances may be bored by analogies that often lead her to a deeper realization about the true nature of a crime. She also has a remarkable ability to latch onto a casual comment and connect it to the case at hand. In several stories, she is able to rely on her acquaintance with [[Sir Henry Clithering]], a retired commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]], for official information when required.\n\nMiss Marple never married and has no close living relatives. Her nephew, the \"well-known author\" Raymond West, appears in some stories, including ''[[The Thirteen Problems]]'', ''Sleeping Murder'' and ''Ingots of Gold'' (which also feature his wife, Joyce Lempri\u00e8re). Raymond overestimates himself and underestimates his aunt's mental acuity. Miss Marple employs young women (including Clara, Emily, Alice, Esther, Gwenda, and Amy) from a nearby orphanage, whom she trains for service as general housemaids after the retirement of her long-time maid-housekeeper, faithful Florence. She was briefly looked after by her irritating companion, Miss Knight. In her later years, companion Cherry Baker, first introduced in ''The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side'', lives in.\n\nMiss Marple has never worked for her living and is of independent means, although she benefits in her old age from the financial support of Raymond West, her nephew (''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'', 1964). She is not herself from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home among them and would probably have been happy to describe herself as \"genteel\"; indeed, a ''[[gentlewoman]]''. Miss Marple may thus be considered a female version of that staple of British detective fiction, the [[gentleman detective]]. She demonstrates a remarkably thorough education, including some art courses that involved study of human anatomy through the study of human cadavers. In ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (1952), it is revealed that Miss Marple grew up in a [[cathedral close]], and that she studied at an Italian finishing school with Americans Ruth Van Rydock and Caroline \"Carrie\" Louise Serrocold.\n\nWhile Miss Marple is described as \"an old lady\" in many of the stories, her age is mentioned in \"At Bertram's Hotel\", where it is said she visited the hotel when she was fourteen and almost sixty years have passed since then. Excluding ''Sleeping Murder'', forty-one years passed between the first and last-written novels, and many characters grow and age. An example would be the Vicar's nephew: in ''The Murder at the Vicarage'', the Reverend Clement's nephew Dennis is a teenager; in ''The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side'', it is mentioned that the nephew is now grown and successful and has a career. The effects of ageing are seen on Miss Marple, such as needing a holiday after illness in ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' but she is if anything more agile in ''[[Nemesis (Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'', set only sixteen months later.\n\nMiss Marple's background is described in some detail, albeit in glimpses across the novels and short stories in which she appears.

These were successful light comedies, but were disappointing to Christie herself.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''The Complete Christie: An Agatha Christie Encyclopedia''. NY: Simon and Schuster, 2000. 386-87.\n{{ISBN|9780671028312}} \nbooks.google.com/books?id=R3syC8weGO8C&pg=PA386</ref> Nevertheless, Agatha Christie dedicated the novel ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' to Rutherford.\n\nRutherford presented the character as a bold and eccentric old lady, different from the prim and birdlike character Christie created in her novels. As penned by Christie, Miss Marple has never worked for a living, but the character as portrayed by Margaret Rutherford briefly works as a cook-housekeeper, a stage actress, a sailor and criminal reformer, and is offered the chance to run a riding establishment-cum-hotel. Her education and genteel background are hinted at when she mentions her awards at marksmanship, fencing, and equestrianism (although these hints are played for comedic value).\n\n''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961, directed by [[George Pollock (director)|George Pollock]]) was the first of four British MGM productions starring Rutherford. This film was based on the 1957 novel ''4:50 from Paddington'' (U.S. title, ''What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!''), and the changes made in the plot were typical of the series. In the film, Mrs. McGillicuddy is cut from the plot. Miss Marple herself sees an apparent murder committed on a train running alongside hers. Likewise, it is Miss Marple herself who poses as a maid to find out the facts of the case, not a young friend of hers who has made a business of it. Actress [[Joan Hickson]], who played Marple in the 1984-1992 television adaptations, has a role as a housekeeper in ''[[Murder, She Said]]''.<ref name=\"celebration140\"/>\n\nThe other Rutherford films, all directed by Pollock, were ''[[Murder at the Gallop]]'' (1963), based on the 1953 [[Hercule Poirot]] novel ''[[After the Funeral]]'' (in this film, she is identified as Miss JTV Marple, though there was no indication as to what the extra initials might stand for); ''[[Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), based on the 1952 Poirot novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]''; and ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1964). The last film is not based on any Christie work but displays a few plot elements from ''They Do It With Mirrors'' (viz., the ship is used as a reform school for wayward boys and one of the teachers uses them as a crime force), and there is a kind of salute to [[The Mousetrap|''The Mousetrap''.]] Rutherford also appeared briefly as Miss Marple in the parodic Hercule Poirot adventure ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).\n\nThe music to all four films was composed and conducted by [[Ron Goodwin]]. The same theme is used on all four films with slight variations in each. The main theme has a distinct 1960s feel to it and is known to be a highly complex piece of music due to the quick playing of the [[violin]]. The score was written within a couple of weeks by Goodwin who was approached by Pollock after Pollock had heard about him from [[Stanley Black]]. Black had worked with Pollock on \"Stranger in Town\" in 1957 and had previously used Goodwin as his orchestrator.\n\nRutherford, who was 68 years old when the first film was shot in February 1961, insisted that she wear her own clothes during the filming of the movie, as well as having her real-life husband, [[Stringer Davis]], appear alongside her as the character 'Mr Stringer'. The Rutherford films are frequently repeated on television in Germany, and in that country Miss Marple is generally identified with Rutherford's quirky portrayal.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721192731/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/mystery/marple2/shoes.html|title=Filling Miss Marple's Shoes|first=Phil|last=Clymer|accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Angela Lansbury===\nIn 1980, [[Angela Lansbury]] played Miss Marple in ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (EMI, directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]), based on Christie's 1962 novel. The film featured an all-star cast that included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Tony Curtis]], and [[Kim Novak]]. [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] appeared as Inspector Craddock, who did Miss Marple's legwork. Lansbury's Marple was a crisp, intelligent woman who moved stiffly and spoke in clipped tones. Unlike most incarnations of Miss Marple, this one smoked cigarettes. Lansbury would find later fame in a similar role as [[Jessica Fletcher]].\n\n===Ita Ever===\nIn 1983, [[Estonians|Estonian]] stage and film actress [[Ita Ever]] starred in the [[Russian language]] [[Mosfilm]] adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (using the Russian edition's translated title, ''The Secret of the Blackbirds'') as the character of Miss Marple.<ref name=\"PBS Mystery.

[[Sue Grafton]] contributed to the screenplay of the former. Hayes's Marple was benign and chirpy. She had earlier appeared in a TV movie adaptation of the non-Marple Christie story ''Murder Is Easy'', playing an elderly lady somewhat similar to Miss Marple.\n\n===Joan Hickson===\n{{Main article|Miss Marple (TV series)}}\n\nFrom 1984 to 1992, the [[BBC]] adapted all of the original Miss Marple novels as a series titled ''Miss Marple''. [[Joan Hickson]] played the lead role. In the 1940s she had appeared on stage in an Agatha Christie play, ''[[Appointment with Death]]'', which was seen by Christie who wrote in a note to her, \"I hope one day you will play my dear Miss Marple\".<ref name=\"celebration140\">{{cite book| last = Haining| first = Peter| title = Agatha Christie: Murder in four acts : a centenary celebration of 'The Queen of Crime' on stage, films, radio & TV| year = 1990| publisher = Carol Pub Group| isbn = 978-1-85227-273-9| page = 140 }}</ref> She portrayed a maid in the 1937 film, ''[[Love from a Stranger (1937 film)|Love from a Stranger]]'', which starred Ann Harding and Basil Rathbone, another Agatha Christie play adaptation.

[[Julia McKenzie]] took over the role in the fourth season.\n\nThe adaptations change the plots and characters of the original books (e.g. incorporating lesbian affairs, changing the identities of some killers, renaming or removing significant characters, and even using stories from other books in which Miss Marple did not originally feature). In the Geraldine McEwan series it is revealed that when she was young (portrayed by [[Julie Cox]] in a flashback), Miss Marple had an affair with a married soldier, Captain Ainsworth, who was killed in action in World War I, in December 1915. It is also said (in ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'') that she served as an ambulance driver during World War I.\n\nListing of the TV series featuring Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie:\n* ''[[The Body in the Library]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[4.50 from Paddington]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[A Murder Is Announced]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Sleeping Murder]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[By the Pricking of My Thumbs]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[The Sittaford Mystery]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[At Bertram's Hotel]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Towards Zero]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[Nemesis (Agatha Christie novel)|Nemesis]]'' (2008)\n* ''[[A Pocket Full of Rye]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Murder Is Easy]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[They Do It with Mirrors]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Why Didn't They Ask Evans?]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[The Pale Horse (novel)|The Pale Horse]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Secret of Chimneys]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Thirteen Problems#The Blue Geranium|The Blue Geranium]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[A Caribbean Mystery]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding#Greenshaw.27s Folly|Greenshaw's Folly]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'' (2013)\n\n===Anime===\n{{Main article|Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple}}\nFrom 2004 to 2005, Japanese TV network [[NHK]] produced a 39 episode [[anime]] series titled ''Agatha Christie's Great Detectives Poirot and Marple'', which features both Miss Marple and [[Hercule Poirot]].

By the mid-1980s, more resistance movements supported by [[Ethiopia]]'s communist [[Derg]] administration had sprung up across the country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerrillas, especially in the northern regions.

By the mid-1980s, more resistance movements supported by [[Ethiopia]]'s communist [[Derg]] administration had sprung up across the country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerrillas, especially in the northern regions.

He was the third child and son of Harish Chandra Raychowdhury (d. 1893), a Kayastha ''[[zamindar]]'' (landed proprietor) and his wife Bhubanmohini Devi (d. 1904), the daughter of a local ''[[taluqdar]]''.<ref name=\"IJHS_Ray_Scientist\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Majumdar | first1 = Sisir K. | url = https://www.insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol46_3_6_SKMajumdar.pdf | title = Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray: A Scientist, Teacher, Author and a Patriotic Entrepreneur | journal = Indian Journal of History of Science | volume = 46.3 | pages = 523\u2013533 | year = 2011 | url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Growth_Decline\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Chatterjee | first1 = Santimay | title = Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray: The Growth and Decline of a Legend | journal = Science and Culture | volume = 51.7 | pages = 213\u2013227 | year = 1985 | url-status = live}}</ref> Ray was one of seven siblings, having four brothers \u2013 Jnanendra Chandra, Nalini Kanta, Purna Chandra and Buddha Dev \u2013 and two sisters, Indumati and Belamati, both born after their brothers; of Ray's siblings, all except Buddha Dev and Belamati survived to adulthood.<ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Growth_Decline\"/>\n\nRay's great-grandfather Maniklal had been a ''dewan'' under the British East India Company's district collector of Krishnanagar and Jessore, and had amassed considerable wealth in the service of the Company. After succeeding to his father's post, Ray's grandfather Anandlal, a progressive man, sent his son Harish Chandra to receive a modern education at [[Krishnagar Government College]].<ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Growth_Decline\"/> At the college, Harish Chandra received a thorough grounding in English, Sanskrit and Persian, though he was ultimately forced to end his studies to help support his family. Liberal and cultured, Harish Chandra pioneered English-medium education and women's education in his village, establishing both a middle school for boys and one for girls, and admitting his wife and sister to the latter.<ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Growth_Decline\"/> Harish Chandra was strongly associated with the [[Brahmo Samaj]],<ref name=\"Lourdusamy2004\"/> and Ray would maintain his connections with the Samaj throughout his life.\n\n===Childhood and early education (1866-1882)===\nIn 1866, Ray began his education in the village school run by his father, and studied there until he was nine.<ref name=\"JICS_Ray_Obit\"/> After Ray's elder brother Jnanendra Chandra completed his middle school studies, his father elected to move the family to Calcutta, where centres of higher learning were more easily accessible.<ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Growth_Decline\"/> Thus in 1870 or 1871, when Ray was about 10, his family migrated to the city, where Harish Chandra rented a house at 132 Amherst Street.<ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Growth_Decline\"/> Ray was admitted to the [[Hare School]] the following year.<ref name=\"IJHS_Ray_Scientist\"/>  In 1874, while Ray was in the fourth standard, he suffered a severe attack of [[dysentery]] and was consequently forced to postpone his studies and return to his ancestral home. He later considered this disruption in his studies as a blessing in disguise as it allowed him to read much more widely than what would have been possible within the constraints of school curricula. While convalescing, he read biographies, articles on science, Lethbridge's 'Selections from Modern English Literature' and [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]]'s ''[[Vicar of Wakefield]]'', among others. He also studied history, geography, Bengali literature, Greek, Latin, French and Sanskrit.<ref name=\"JICS_Ray_Obit\"/> Although he made a full recovery, he suffered residual bouts of indigestion and insomnia for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"PC_Ray_bio_INSA\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Ray | first1 = Priyadaranjan | url = http://insaindia.res.in/BM/BM1_6606.pdf | title = Prafulla Chandra Ray: 1861\u20131944 | journal = Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy | volume = 1 | pages = 58\u201376 | year = 1944 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Young P.C. Ray.jpg|thumb|Young Prafulla Chandra Ray]]\nAfter recovering from his illness, Ray returned to Calcutta in 1876 and was admitted to the Albert School, established by the Brahmo reformer [[Keshub Chandra Sen]]; owing to his concentrated self-study over the preceding two years, his teachers found him to have advanced much further than the rest of the students in his assigned class. During this period, he attended Sen's Sunday evening sermons and was deeply influenced by his ''Sulabha Samachar''.<ref name=\"Lourdusamy2004\"/> In 1878, he passed the school's Entrance Examination (matriculation exams) with a First Division, and was admitted as an FA (First Arts) student to the Metropolitan Institution (later [[Vidyasagar College]]) which was established by Pandit [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]]. The English literature teacher at the Institution was [[Surendranath Banerjee]], the prominent Indian nationalist and future president of the [[Indian National Congress]], whose passionately held ideals including an emphasis on the value of service and the need to continually strive for India's rejuvenation left a definite and lasting impression on Ray, who took those values to heart.<ref name=\"PC_Ray_bio_INSA\"/> While deeply influenced by Sen, Ray preferred a more democratic environment than the mainstream Brahmo Samaj under Sen's guidance could provide; consequently, in 1879 he joined the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]], a more flexible offshoot of the original Samaj.<ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Study\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Bose | first1 = Debendra Mohan | title = Acharya Prafullachandra Ray: A Study| journal = Science and Culture | volume = 28.11| pages = 493\u2013500 | year = 1962 | url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nThough Ray had primarily focused on history and literature until this stage, chemistry was then a compulsory subject in the FA degree. As the Metropolitan Institution offered no facilities for science courses at the time, Ray attended physics and chemistry lectures as an external student at the [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]].<ref name=\"PC_Ray_bio_INSA\"/> He was especially drawn to the chemistry courses taught by [[Alexander Pedler]], an inspiring lecturer and experimentalist who was among the earliest research chemists in India. Soon captivated by experimental science, Ray decided to make chemistry his career, as he recognised that his country's future would greatly depend on her progress in science.<ref name=\"JICS_Ray_Obit\"/> His passion for experimentation led him to set up a miniature chemistry laboratory at a classmate's lodgings and reproducing some of Pedler's demonstrations; on one occasion, he narrowly escaped injury when a faulty apparatus exploded violently.<ref name=\"JICS_Ray_Obit\"/> He passed the FA exam in 1881 with a second division, and was admitted to the BA (B-course) degree of the University of Calcutta as a chemistry student, with a view towards pursuing higher studies in the field.<ref name=\"IJHS_Ray_Scientist\"/> Having learnt Latin and French in addition to achieving a \"fair mastery\" of Sanskrit, a compulsory subject at the FA level, Ray applied for a Gilchrist Prize Scholarship  while studying for his BA examination; the scholarship required a knowledge of at least four languages. After an all-India competitive examination, Ray won one of the two scholarships, and enrolled as a BSc. student at the [[University of Edinburgh]] without completing his original degree.<ref name=\"PC_Ray_bio_INSA\"/> He sailed for the United Kingdom in August 1882, aged 21.<ref name=\"IJHS_Ray_Scientist\"/>\n\n===Student in Britain (1882-1888)===\nAt Edinburgh, Ray began his chemistry studies under [[Alexander Crum Brown]] and his demonstrator John Gibson, a former student of Brown's who had also studied under [[Robert Bunsen]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]].

Although his thesis advisor Crum Brown was an organic chemist, Ray was drawn towards [[inorganic chemistry]] at a time when research in the field appeared to be making limited progress compared to organic chemistry. Following an extensive review of available inorganic chemistry literature, Ray decided to explore the specific natures of structural affinities in [[double salts]] as the subject of his thesis. Within this area, Ray chose to research metal double sulfates.<ref name=\"Ray_Doctoral_Research\"/>\n\nFor some years, science had recognised numerous double sulfates (then also known as \"vitriols\") occurred in nature as mineral salts. The natural combination of sulfates of bivalent metals with monovalent metal sulfates in a 1:1 ratio results in the formation of double sulfates chemically distinct from their original constituent species.<ref name=\"Ray_Doctoral_Research\"/> By the 1850s, a number of double sulfates had been artificially synthesized, including [[ammonium iron(II) sulfate]] or \"Mohr's salt\" by [[Karl Friedrich Mohr]]. Some chemists, including one Vohl, subsequently claimed to have isolated numerous double-double and multiple-double sulfates including supposed \"triple-double,\" and \"quadruple-double\" structures. These were purportedly the result of two double sulfates of Type I (differing in the bivalent metal Mb) combining in definite integral proportions to yield new molecular double salts.<ref name=\"Ray_Doctoral_Research\"/> Others who had attempted to reproduce those experiments reported their inability to do so. Prior to Ray's taking up the problem, in 1886, [[Percival Spencer Umfreville Pickering]] and [[Emily Aston]] had concluded in their paper that double-double and higher-order sulfate salts did not exist as definite structures, deeming Vohl's experimental findings inexplicable.<ref name=\"Ray_Doctoral_Research\"/> While Ray noted such findings placed Vohl's research in doubt, he reasoned \"the position was unclear and further research was called for.\"<ref name=\"Ray_Doctoral_Research\"/>\n\nRay was awarded the Hope Prize which allowed him to work on his research for a further period of one year after completion of his doctorate. His thesis title was \"Conjugated Sulphates of the Copper-magnesium Group: A Study of Isomorphous Mixtures and Molecular Combinations\". While a student he was elected Vice-President of the University of Edinburgh Chemical Society in 1888.<ref name=\"PetitjeanJami1992\">{{cite book|author1=Patrick Petitjean|author2=Catherine Jami|author3=Anne Marie Moulin|title=Science and Empires: Historical Studies about Scientific Development and European Expansion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JnUeeLgYaowC&pg=PA66|year=1992|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-1518-6|pages=66\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPrafulla Chandra returned to India in the first week of August 1888 and subsequently joined Presidency College, Calcutta as temporary Assistant Professor of Chemistry in 1889. Ray who had a doctorate in science from the University of Edinburgh felt deeply aggrieved when even with his excellent educational credentials he was not able to secure a position within the Imperial service (his academic position was within the 'provincial service') and attributed this to the discriminatory attitude of the ruling government towards native intelligentsia. He complained to the top officials of the government but with no effect.{{Citation needed|reason=lacks citations|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Prafulla Chandra Ray bust BITM.JPG|thumb|Bust of Prafulla Chandra Ray which is placed in the garden of [[Birla Industrial & Technological Museum]], Kolkata]]\n\n===Scientific Research===\n====Mercurous nitrite====\nAround 1895 Prafulla Chandra started his work in the field of discovering nitrite chemistry which turned out to be extremely effective.

Here also he got a dedicated team and he started working on compounds of gold, [[platinum]], [[iridium]] etc. with [[mercaptyl]] radicals and organic sulphides. A number of papers were published on this work in the Journal of the Indian Chemical Society.\n\nIn 1936, at the age of 75, he retired from active service and became [[Professor Emeritus]]. Long before that, on the completion of his 60th year in 1921, he made a free gift of his entire salary to the Calcutta University from that date onward, to be spent for the furtherance of chemical research, and the development of the Department of Chemistry in the University College of Science.\n\nHe had written 107 papers in all branches of Chemistry by 1920.<ref name=\"PetitjeanJami1992\"/>\n\n===Literary works and interests===\nHe contributed articles in Bengali to many monthly magazines, particularly on scientific topics.

He was the third child and son of Harish Chandra Raychowdhury (d. 1893), a Kayastha ''[[zamindar]]'' (landed proprietor) and his wife Bhubanmohini Devi (d. 1904), the daughter of a local ''[[taluqdar]]''.<ref name=\"IJHS_Ray_Scientist\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Majumdar | first1 = Sisir K. | url = https://www.insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol46_3_6_SKMajumdar.pdf | title = Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray: A Scientist, Teacher, Author and a Patriotic Entrepreneur | journal = Indian Journal of History of Science | volume = 46.3 | pages = 523\u2013533 | year = 2011 | url-status = live}}</ref><ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Growth_Decline\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Chatterjee | first1 = Santimay | title = Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray: The Growth and Decline of a Legend | journal = Science and Culture | volume = 51.7 | pages = 213\u2013227 | year = 1985 | url-status = live}}</ref> Ray was one of seven siblings, having four brothers \u2013 Jnanendra Chandra, Nalini Kanta, Purna Chandra and Buddha Dev \u2013 and two sisters, Indumati and Belamati, both born after their brothers; of Ray's siblings, all except Buddha Dev and Belamati survived to adulthood.<ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Growth_Decline\"/>\n\nRay's great-grandfather Maniklal had been a ''dewan'' under the British East India Company's district collector of Krishnanagar and Jessore, and had amassed considerable wealth in the service of the Company. After succeeding to his father's post, Ray's grandfather Anandlal, a progressive man, sent his son Harish Chandra to receive a modern education at [[Krishnagar Government College]].<ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Growth_Decline\"/> At the college, Harish Chandra received a thorough grounding in English, Sanskrit and Persian, though he was ultimately forced to end his studies to help support his family. Liberal and cultured, Harish Chandra pioneered English-medium education and women's education in his village, establishing both a middle school for boys and one for girls, and admitting his wife and sister to the latter.<ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Growth_Decline\"/> Harish Chandra was strongly associated with the [[Brahmo Samaj]],<ref name=\"Lourdusamy2004\"/> and Ray would maintain his connections with the Samaj throughout his life.\n\n===Childhood and early education (1866-1882)===\nIn 1866, Ray began his education in the village school run by his father, and studied there until he was nine.<ref name=\"JICS_Ray_Obit\"/> After Ray's elder brother Jnanendra Chandra completed his middle school studies, his father elected to move the family to Calcutta, where centres of higher learning were more easily accessible.<ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Growth_Decline\"/> Thus in 1870 or 1871, when Ray was about 10, his family migrated to the city, where Harish Chandra rented a house at 132 Amherst Street.<ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Growth_Decline\"/> Ray was admitted to the [[Hare School]] the following year.<ref name=\"IJHS_Ray_Scientist\"/>  In 1874, while Ray was in the fourth standard, he suffered a severe attack of [[dysentery]] and was consequently forced to postpone his studies and return to his ancestral home. He later considered this disruption in his studies as a blessing in disguise as it allowed him to read much more widely than what would have been possible within the constraints of school curricula. While convalescing, he read biographies, articles on science, Lethbridge's 'Selections from Modern English Literature' and [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]]'s ''[[Vicar of Wakefield]]'', among others. He also studied history, geography, Bengali literature, Greek, Latin, French and Sanskrit.<ref name=\"JICS_Ray_Obit\"/> Although he made a full recovery, he suffered residual bouts of indigestion and insomnia for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"PC_Ray_bio_INSA\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Ray | first1 = Priyadaranjan | url = http://insaindia.res.in/BM/BM1_6606.pdf | title = Prafulla Chandra Ray: 1861\u20131944 | journal = Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy | volume = 1 | pages = 58\u201376 | year = 1944 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Young P.C. Ray.jpg|thumb|Young Prafulla Chandra Ray]]\nAfter recovering from his illness, Ray returned to Calcutta in 1876 and was admitted to the Albert School, established by the Brahmo reformer [[Keshub Chandra Sen]]; owing to his concentrated self-study over the preceding two years, his teachers found him to have advanced much further than the rest of the students in his assigned class. During this period, he attended Sen's Sunday evening sermons and was deeply influenced by his ''Sulabha Samachar''.<ref name=\"Lourdusamy2004\"/> In 1878, he passed the school's Entrance Examination (matriculation exams) with a First Division, and was admitted as an FA (First Arts) student to the Metropolitan Institution (later [[Vidyasagar College]]) which was established by Pandit [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]]. The English literature teacher at the Institution was [[Surendranath Banerjee]], the prominent Indian nationalist and future president of the [[Indian National Congress]], whose passionately held ideals including an emphasis on the value of service and the need to continually strive for India's rejuvenation left a definite and lasting impression on Ray, who took those values to heart.<ref name=\"PC_Ray_bio_INSA\"/> While deeply influenced by Sen, Ray preferred a more democratic environment than the mainstream Brahmo Samaj under Sen's guidance could provide; consequently, in 1879 he joined the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]], a more flexible offshoot of the original Samaj.<ref name=\"Acharya_Ray_Study\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Bose | first1 = Debendra Mohan | title = Acharya Prafullachandra Ray: A Study| journal = Science and Culture | volume = 28.11| pages = 493\u2013500 | year = 1962 | url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nThough Ray had primarily focused on history and literature until this stage, chemistry was then a compulsory subject in the FA degree. As the Metropolitan Institution offered no facilities for science courses at the time, Ray attended physics and chemistry lectures as an external student at the [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]].<ref name=\"PC_Ray_bio_INSA\"/> He was especially drawn to the chemistry courses taught by [[Alexander Pedler]], an inspiring lecturer and experimentalist who was among the earliest research chemists in India. Soon captivated by experimental science, Ray decided to make chemistry his career, as he recognised that his country's future would greatly depend on her progress in science.<ref name=\"JICS_Ray_Obit\"/> His passion for experimentation led him to set up a miniature chemistry laboratory at a classmate's lodgings and reproducing some of Pedler's demonstrations; on one occasion, he narrowly escaped injury when a faulty apparatus exploded violently.<ref name=\"JICS_Ray_Obit\"/> He passed the FA exam in 1881 with a second division, and was admitted to the BA (B-course) degree of the University of Calcutta as a chemistry student, with a view towards pursuing higher studies in the field.<ref name=\"IJHS_Ray_Scientist\"/> Having learnt Latin and French in addition to achieving a \"fair mastery\" of Sanskrit, a compulsory subject at the FA level, Ray applied for a Gilchrist Prize Scholarship  while studying for his BA examination; the scholarship required a knowledge of at least four languages. After an all-India competitive examination, Ray won one of the two scholarships, and enrolled as a BSc. student at the [[University of Edinburgh]] without completing his original degree.<ref name=\"PC_Ray_bio_INSA\"/> He sailed for the United Kingdom in August 1882, aged 21.<ref name=\"IJHS_Ray_Scientist\"/>\n\n===Student in Britain (1882-1888)===\nAt Edinburgh, Ray began his chemistry studies under [[Alexander Crum Brown]] and his demonstrator John Gibson, a former student of Brown's who had also studied under [[Robert Bunsen]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]].

Although his thesis advisor Crum Brown was an organic chemist, Ray was drawn towards [[inorganic chemistry]] at a time when research in the field appeared to be making limited progress compared to organic chemistry. Following an extensive review of available inorganic chemistry literature, Ray decided to explore the specific natures of structural affinities in [[double salts]] as the subject of his thesis. Within this area, Ray chose to research metal double sulfates.<ref name=\"Ray_Doctoral_Research\"/>\n\nFor some years, science had recognised numerous double sulfates (then also known as \"vitriols\") occurred in nature as mineral salts. The natural combination of sulfates of bivalent metals with monovalent metal sulfates in a 1:1 ratio results in the formation of double sulfates chemically distinct from their original constituent species.<ref name=\"Ray_Doctoral_Research\"/> By the 1850s, a number of double sulfates had been artificially synthesized, including [[ammonium iron(II) sulfate]] or \"Mohr's salt\" by [[Karl Friedrich Mohr]]. Some chemists, including one Vohl, subsequently claimed to have isolated numerous double-double and multiple-double sulfates including supposed \"triple-double,\" and \"quadruple-double\" structures. These were purportedly the result of two double sulfates of Type I (differing in the bivalent metal Mb) combining in definite integral proportions to yield new molecular double salts.<ref name=\"Ray_Doctoral_Research\"/> Others who had attempted to reproduce those experiments reported their inability to do so. Prior to Ray's taking up the problem, in 1886, [[Percival Spencer Umfreville Pickering]] and [[Emily Aston]] had concluded in their paper that double-double and higher-order sulfate salts did not exist as definite structures, deeming Vohl's experimental findings inexplicable.<ref name=\"Ray_Doctoral_Research\"/> While Ray noted such findings placed Vohl's research in doubt, he reasoned \"the position was unclear and further research was called for.\"<ref name=\"Ray_Doctoral_Research\"/>\n\nRay was awarded the Hope Prize which allowed him to work on his research for a further period of one year after completion of his doctorate. His thesis title was \"Conjugated Sulphates of the Copper-magnesium Group: A Study of Isomorphous Mixtures and Molecular Combinations\".

Ray who had a doctorate in science from the University of Edinburgh felt deeply aggrieved when even with his excellent educational credentials he was not able to secure a position within the Imperial service (his academic position was within the 'provincial service') and attributed this to the discriminatory attitude of the ruling government towards native intelligentsia. He complained to the top officials of the government but with no effect.{{Citation needed|reason=lacks citations|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Prafulla Chandra Ray bust BITM.JPG|thumb|Bust of Prafulla Chandra Ray which is placed in the garden of [[Birla Industrial & Technological Museum]], Kolkata]]\n\n===Scientific Research===\n====Mercurous nitrite====\nAround 1895 Prafulla Chandra started his work in the field of discovering nitrite chemistry which turned out to be extremely effective.

Grants of land are also awarded to individuals and companies as incentives to develop unused land in relatively unpopulated countries; the process of awarding land grants are not limited to the countries named below. The United States historically gave out numerous land grants as Homesteads to individuals desiring to prove a farm. The American Industrial Revolution was guided by many supportive acts of legislatures (for example, the [[Main Line of Public Works]] legislation of 1826) promoting commerce or [[transportation]] [[infrastructure]] development by private companies, such as the [[Cumberland Road]] [[Toll road|turnpike]], the [[Lehigh Canal]], the [[Schuylkill Canal]], and the many railroads that tied the young United States together.\n\n==Ancient Rome==\n[[Military history of ancient Rome|Roman soldiers]] were given [[pensions]] (''[[Aerarium militare#Benefits|praemia]]'') at the end of their service including cash or land. [[Augustus]] fixed the amount in AD 5 at 3,000 [[Denarius|denarii]] and by the time of [[Caracalla]] it had risen to 5,000 denarii.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roman-empire.net/army/army.html |title=The Roman Army |publisher=Roman-empire.net |date=2012-04-08 |accessdate=2013-02-12}}</ref>  One denarius was roughly equivalent to a day's wages for an unskilled laborer.\n\n==Australia==\nIn 1788 the British claimed all of eastern [[Australia]] as its own, and forming the colony of [[New South Wales]] in Australia.

The instructions to [[Thomas Brisbane|Governor Brisbane]] were issued on 17 July 1825. From 9 January 1831, all land was to be sold at [[public auction]].\n\nThere were also significant [[land grants in the Swan River Colony]] (Western Australia), and in [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania) from 1803.\n\n=== Land grant railways ===\n* In 1886, the [[Midland Railway of Western Australia]] was granted land concessions to build and operate a railway from Midland, near Perth, to Walkaway, near [[Geraldton]].  This was built, but taken over by the government railway in the 1950s. It was and is {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge.\n* In 1889, a land grant railway from [[Roebuck Bay]] in [[Western Australia]] to [[Angle Pole]] in [[South Australia]] was proposed.  This would have been 1000 miles (1600&nbsp;km) long.  Angle Pole was a locality where the Telegraph line had a bend in it.  It was stillborn.

The plan was abandoned, though the government railway was extended in the 1920s from [[Oodnadatta]] to [[Alice Springs]], with similar extensions at the [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] end.  It was originally {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge, but was replaced by a new {{RailGauge|1435mm}} gauge line on a different route.\n* In 1909, a land grant [[transcontinental railway|railway]] was proposed in [[Queensland]] from [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]] to [[Point Parker]] on the shores of the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], but the plan was abandoned.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32136123 |title=TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY. |newspaper=[[Cairns Morning Post|Cairns Morning Post (Qld. : 1907-1909)]] |location=Qld. |date=22 February 1909 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\nla\n==Canada==\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] was incorporated in 1670 with the grant of [[Rupert's Land]] by King [[Charles II of England]]; this vast territory was greater than one third the area of Canada today. Following the [[Rupert's Land Act 1868|Rupert's Land Act]] in the British Parliament, Rupert's Land was sold in 1869 to the newly formed [[Canadian Government]] for the nominal sum of \u00a3300,000.\n\nLand grants were an incentive for the construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway#The CPR and the colonization of Canada|Canadian Pacific Railway]].\n\n==Ireland==\nThe [[Plantations of Ireland]] in the 16th and 17th centuries involved the confiscation of some or all the land of Irish lords and its grant to settlers (\"planters\") from England or Scotland. The English Parliament's [[Adventurers Act]] 1642 and [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]] specifically entitled \"Adventurers\" who funded the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] to lands seized from the leaders of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and the ensuing [[Confederate Ireland|Confederacy]].\n\n== New Zealand ==fa\nIn New Zealand two private railway companies were offered land grants to build a railway, though both were eventually taken over by the government and incorporated into the government-owned [[New Zealand Railways Department]].  \n:The [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company]] built and operated the 134 km [[Wellington-Manawatu Line]] north of Wellington to the Manawatu from 1881. The company was New Zealand owned. It was taken over by the government in 1908, and the line became part of the [[North Island Main Trunk]]. \n:The [[New Zealand Midland Railway Company]] started the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] between Canterbury and the West Coast in 1886 but the British-owned company was taken over by the government in 1895, having constructed only 131 km of the 376 km route.\n\n==United States==\n[[File:Virginia Land Office Warrant Number 229 to Joseph Cabell for Gabriel Penn.jpg|thumb|[[Virginia]] Land Office warrant issued in 1779 to Joseph Cabell, assignee of [[Sergeant|Sgt.]] Gabriel Penn, to receive 200 [[acres]] of land in return for Penn's service in the [[French and Indian War]]]]\n\n===Colonial era===\n\nIn America, starting in the 16th century, land grants were given for the purpose of establishing [[town|settlements]], missions, and [[farm]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/astronomy-and-space-exploration/space-exploration/land-grants|title=Land grants {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}</ref> England started with a [[headright]] system, used both by the [[Virginia Company of London]] and the [[Plymouth Colony]], but later used primarily in colonies south of [[Maryland]]. Under this system, emigrants or those paying for their passage would receive land if they survived for a certain period of time (although many indentured servants did not survive their contracts and enslaved Africans were ineligible for headrights). Countries granting land included Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, and Britain.\n\nAs English colonial law developed, headrights became patents and a '''patentee''' had to improve the land. Under this doctrine of '''planting and seeding''', the patentee was required to cultivate {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} of land and build a small house on the property, otherwise the patent would revert to the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~rwguide/lesson29a.htm |title=Roots web |publisher=Roots web |date= |accessdate=2013-02-12}}</ref>la\n\nBetween 1783 and 1821, Spain offered land grants to anyone who settled in their colony of [[Florida]]. When the United States acquired that land by treaty, it agreed to honor all valid land grants. As a result, years of litigation ensued over the validity of many of the Spanish Land Grants. Spain and Mexico used the same system of offering land grants along the Rio Grande River near the Texas/Mexico border. These grants were given to help colonization of the area by Mexican and Spanish nationals, and strengthen frontier towns along the Texas border. During the [[Ranchos of California#Mexican era|Mexican period]] of [[California]] (and other portions of Mexican territories inherited from [[New Spain]]),the Mexican government granted individuals hundreds of [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] or large tracts of land. The ranchos established land-use patterns that remain recognizable in the [[California]] of today.<ref>David Hornbeck,''Land tenure and rancho expansion in Alta California, 1784\u20131846'', Journal of Historical Geography, Volume 4, Issue 4, October 1978, Pages  371\u2013390</ref> Controversy over community land grant claims in [[New Mexico]] persist to this day.<ref name=\"Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo: Findings and Possible Options Regarding Longstanding Community Land Grant Claims in New Mexico\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0459.pdf|title=Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo: Findings and Possible Options Regarding Longstanding Community Land Grant Claims in New Mexico|publisher=General Accounting Office|accessdate=5 June 2008|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n===Public lands and bounty-land warrants===\nFuture President [[Thomas Jefferson]] crafted the [[Ordinance of 1784]] which carved out ten prospective states west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and established the basis for the [[Public Land Survey System]]. The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] provided a method for settling that land and establishing governmental institutions, which became federal land policy until 1862. The [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 established the [[Northwest Territory]], pursuant to which homesteading settlers could buy land, and certain land was set aside for public schools and other purposes. The Federal Government acquired additional lands by treaties with various Native American Tribes, such as the 1833 [[Treaty of Chicago]] by which many eastern tribes agreed to settle across the [[Mississippi River]]. Revenues from public land purchases were a major source of funding for the federal government through the 19th centuries, along with tariff revenues, since the federal income tax was not established until the 20th century.\n\nStarting with the [[American Revolutionary War]], United States veterans often received land grants instead of backpay or other remuneration.<ref>William D.

Grants of land are also awarded to individuals and companies as incentives to develop unused land in relatively unpopulated countries; the process of awarding land grants are not limited to the countries named below. The United States historically gave out numerous land grants as Homesteads to individuals desiring to prove a farm. The American Industrial Revolution was guided by many supportive acts of legislatures (for example, the [[Main Line of Public Works]] legislation of 1826) promoting commerce or [[transportation]] [[infrastructure]] development by private companies, such as the [[Cumberland Road]] [[Toll road|turnpike]], the [[Lehigh Canal]], the [[Schuylkill Canal]], and the many railroads that tied the young United States together.\n\n==Ancient Rome==\n[[Military history of ancient Rome|Roman soldiers]] were given [[pensions]] (''[[Aerarium militare#Benefits|praemia]]'') at the end of their service including cash or land.

The instructions to [[Thomas Brisbane|Governor Brisbane]] were issued on 17 July 1825. From 9 January 1831, all land was to be sold at [[public auction]].\n\nThere were also significant [[land grants in the Swan River Colony]] (Western Australia), and in [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania) from 1803.\n\n=== Land grant railways ===\n* In 1886, the [[Midland Railway of Western Australia]] was granted land concessions to build and operate a railway from Midland, near Perth, to Walkaway, near [[Geraldton]].  This was built, but taken over by the government railway in the 1950s. It was and is {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge.\n* In 1889, a land grant railway from [[Roebuck Bay]] in [[Western Australia]] to [[Angle Pole]] in [[South Australia]] was proposed.  This would have been 1000 miles (1600&nbsp;km) long.  Angle Pole was a locality where the Telegraph line had a bend in it.  It was stillborn.

The English Parliament's [[Adventurers Act]] 1642 and [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]] specifically entitled \"Adventurers\" who funded the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] to lands seized from the leaders of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and the ensuing [[Confederate Ireland|Confederacy]].\n\n== New Zealand ==\nIn New Zealand two private railway companies were offered land grants to build a railway, though both were eventually taken over by the government and incorporated into the government-owned [[New Zealand Railways Department]].  \n:The [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company]] built and operated the 134 km [[Wellington-Manawatu Line]] north of Wellington to the Manawatu from 1881. The company was New Zealand owned. It was taken over by the government in 1908, and the line became part of the [[North Island Main Trunk]]. \n:The [[New Zealand Midland Railway Company]] started the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] between Canterbury and the West Coast in 1886 but the British-owned company was taken over by the government in 1895, having constructed only 131 km of the 376 km route.\n\n==United States==\n[[File:Virginia Land Office Warrant Number 229 to Joseph Cabell for Gabriel Penn.jpg|thumb|[[Virginia]] Land Office warrant issued in 1779 to Joseph Cabell, assignee of [[Sergeant|Sgt.]] Gabriel Penn, to receive 200 [[acres]] of land in return for Penn's service in the [[French and Indian War]]]]\n\n===Colonial era===\n\nIn America, starting in the 16th century, land grants were given for the purpose of establishing [[town|settlements]], missions, and [[farm]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/astronomy-and-space-exploration/space-exploration/land-grants|title=Land grants {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}</ref> England started with a [[headright]] system, used both by the [[Virginia Company of London]] and the [[Plymouth Colony]], but later used primarily in colonies south of [[Maryland]]. Under this system, emigrants or those paying for their passage would receive land if they survived for a certain period of time (although many indentured servants did not survive their contracts and enslaved Africans were ineligible for headrights). Countries granting land included Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, and Britain.\n\nAs English colonial law developed, headrights became patents and a '''patentee''' had to improve the land. Under this doctrine of '''planting and seeding''', the patentee was required to cultivate {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} of land and build a small house on the property, otherwise the patent would revert to the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~rwguide/lesson29a.htm |title=Roots web |publisher=Roots web |date= |accessdate=2013-02-12}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1783 and 1821, Spain offered land grants to anyone who settled in their colony of [[Florida]]. When the United States acquired that land by treaty, it agreed to honor all valid land grants. As a result, years of litigation ensued over the validity of many of the Spanish Land Grants. Spain and Mexico used the same system of offering land grants along the Rio Grande River near the Texas/Mexico border. These grants were given to help colonization of the area by Mexican and Spanish nationals, and strengthen frontier towns along the Texas border. During the [[Ranchos of California#Mexican era|Mexican period]] of [[California]] (and other portions of Mexican territories inherited from [[New Spain]]),the Mexican government granted individuals hundreds of [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] or large tracts of land. The ranchos established land-use patterns that remain recognizable in the [[California]] of today.<ref>David Hornbeck,''Land tenure and rancho expansion in Alta California, 1784\u20131846'', Journal of Historical Geography, Volume 4, Issue 4, October 1978, Pages  371\u2013390</ref> Controversy over community land grant claims in [[New Mexico]] persist to this day.<ref name=\"Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo: Findings and Possible Options Regarding Longstanding Community Land Grant Claims in New Mexico\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0459.pdf|title=Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo: Findings and Possible Options Regarding Longstanding Community Land Grant Claims in New Mexico|publisher=General Accounting Office|accessdate=5 June 2008|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n===Public lands and bounty-land warrants===\nFuture President [[Thomas Jefferson]] crafted the [[Ordinance of 1784]] which carved out ten prospective states west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and established the basis for the [[Public Land Survey System]]. The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] provided a method for settling that land and establishing governmental institutions, which became federal land policy until 1862. The [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 established the [[Northwest Territory]], pursuant to which homesteading settlers could buy land, and certain land was set aside for public schools and other purposes. The Federal Government acquired additional lands by treaties with various Native American Tribes, such as the 1833 [[Treaty of Chicago]] by which many eastern tribes agreed to settle across the [[Mississippi River]].
