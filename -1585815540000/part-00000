If [[futurism]] is sometimes called a \"science\" bent on anticipating what will come, retrofuturism is the remembering of that anticipation.<ref>Elizabeth Guffey and Kate C. Lemay, \"Retrofuturism and Steampunk\", ''The Oxford Handbook to Science Fiction'', Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 434.</ref> Characterized by a blend of old-fashioned \"[[retro style]]s\" with futuristic technology, retrofuturism explores the themes of tension between past and future, and between the alienating and empowering effects of [[technology]]. Primarily reflected in artistic creations and modified technologies that realize the imagined artifacts of its parallel reality, retrofuturism can be seen as \"an animating perspective on the world\".<ref>Robert Lanham, \"Introduction\", ''The Oxford Handbook to Science Fiction'', Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 14</ref> However, it has also manifested in the worlds of fashion, architecture, design, music, literature, film, and video games.\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', an early use of the term appears in a Bloomingdales advertisement in a 1983 issue of ''[[The New York Times]]''. The ad talks of jewellery that is \"silverized steel and sleek grey linked for a retro-futuristic look\". In an example more related to retrofuturism as an exploration of past visions of the future, the term appears in the form of \u201cretro-futurist\u201d in a 1984 review of the film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/brazil|title=''Brazil''|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}</ref> Critic [[Pauline Kael]] writes, \"[Terry Gilliam] presents a retro-futurist fantasy.\"<ref>\"retro, adj. and n.2.\" OED Online.

In avant-garde artistic, literary and design circles, futurism is a long-standing and well established term.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} But in its more popular form, futurism (sometimes referred to as [[futurology]]) is \"an early optimism that focused on the past and was rooted in the nineteenth century, an early-twentieth-century 'golden age' that continued long into the 1960s' [[Space Age]]\". <ref>Elizabeth Guffey and Kate C. Lemay, \"Retrofuturism and Steampunk\", The Oxford Handbook to Science Fiction, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 435.</ref>\n\nRetrofuturism is first and foremost based on modern but changing notions of \"the future\".  As Guffey notes, retrofuturism is \"a recent neologism\", but it \"builds on futurists' fevered visions of space colonies with flying cars, robotic servants, and interstellar travel on display there; where futurists took their promise for granted, retro-futurism emerged as a more skeptical reaction to these dreams\".<ref>Elizabeth Guffey, \"Crafting Yesterday's Tomorrows: Retro-Futurism, Steampunk, and Making in the Twenty-First Century\", ''Journal of Modern Craft'' 7.3 (November, 2014) p. 254.</ref> It took its current shape in the 1970s, a time when technology was rapidly changing. From the advent of the personal computer to the birth of the first test tube baby, this period was characterized by intense and rapid technological change. But many in the general public began to question whether applied science would achieve its earlier promise\u2014that life would inevitably improve through technological progress. In the wake of the Vietnam War, environmental depredations, and the energy crisis, many commentators began to question the benefits of applied science. But they also wondered, sometimes in awe, sometimes in confusion, at the scientific positivism evinced by earlier generations. Retrofuturism \"seeped into academic and popular culture in the 1960s and 1970s\", inflecting [[George Lucas]]'s ''Star Wars'' and the paintings of pop artist [[Kenny Scharf]] alike\".<ref>Elizabeth Guffey, ''Retro: The Culture of Revival'' (Reaktion: 2006):155\u2013157</ref> Surveying the optimistic futurism of the early twentieth century, the historians Joe Corn and Brian Horrigan remind us that retrofuturism is \"a history of an idea, or a system of ideas\u2014an ideology. The future, or course, does not exist except as an act of belief or imagination.\"<ref>Joseph J. Corn and Brian Horrigan, ''Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Visions of the American Future'' (Johns Hopkins Press: 1984): xii.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:CaptainMarvelJrNo17.jpg|thumb|Retrofuturistic cities were popular subject in [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age comic books]]. From ''[[Captain Marvel Jr]]'' number 17 (March 1944); artwork by [[Mac Raboy]] ]]\n\nRetrofuturism incorporates two overlapping trends which may be summarized as ''the future as seen from the past'' and ''the past as seen from the future''.\n\nThe first trend, retrofuturism proper, is directly inspired by the imagined future which existed in the minds of writers, artists, and filmmakers in the pre-1960 period who attempted to predict the future, either in serious projections of existing technology (e.g. in magazines like ''[[Science and Invention]]'') or in [[science fiction]] novels and stories. Such futuristic visions are refurbished and updated for the present, and offer a nostalgic, counterfactual image of what the future might have been, but is not.\n\nThe second trend is the inverse of the first: futuristic [[retro]]. It starts with the retro appeal of old styles of art, clothing, mores, and then grafts modern or futuristic technologies onto it, creating a m\u00e9lange of past, present, and future elements. [[Steampunk]], a term applying both to the retrojection of futuristic technology into an alternative Victorian age, and the application of neo-Victorian styles to modern technology, is a highly successful version of this second trend. In the movie ''[[Space Station 76]]'' (2014), mankind has reached the stars, but clothes, technology, furnitures and above all social taboos are purposely highly reminiscent of the mid-1970s.\n\nIn practice, the two trends cannot be sharply distinguished, as they mutually contribute to similar visions. Retrofuturism of the first type is inevitably influenced by the scientific, technological, and social awareness of the present, and modern retrofuturistic creations are never simply copies of their pre-1960 inspirations; rather, they are given a new (often wry or ironic) twist by being seen from a modern perspective.\n\nIn the same way, futuristic retro owes much of its flavor to early [[science fiction]] (e.g. the works of [[Jules Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells]]), and in a quest for stylistic authenticity may continue to draw on writers and artists of the desired period.\n\nBoth retrofuturistic trends in themselves refer to no specific time. When a time period is supplied for a story, it might be a counterfactual present with unique technology; a fantastic version of the future; or an alternate past in which the imagined (fictitious or projected) inventions of the past were indeed real. Examples include the film ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'', set in an imaginary 1939, and ''[[Rocketeer|The Rocketeer]]'' franchise, set in 1938, both of which are also examples of the genre known as [[dieselpunk]].<ref name=\"Discovering Dieselpunk p3\">{{Citation|url=http://www.ottens.co.uk/gatehouse/Gazette%20-%201.pdf |title=Discovering Dieselpunk |last=Piecraft |first2=Nick |last2=Ottens |journal=The Gatehouse Gazette |issue=Issue 1 |date=July 2008 |pages=4, 8, 9 |accessdate=2012-10-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229235716/http://www.ottens.co.uk/gatehouse/Gazette%20-%201.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-29 }}</ref> [[Adam Reed]]'s animated comedy series [[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]] is also set in a retrofuture aesthetic world.<br/>\nThe import of retrofuturism has, in recent years, come under considerable discussion.

In some respects, an extrapolation of the present to the future produces disappointing, or even ghastly results, exemplified in [[cyberpunk]] and other [[dystopia]]n futures often characterized by overpopulation, environmental degradation, societal degradation<!--/decay--> and transfer of power to unaccountable private entities or governments. Compared to such imaginations of the future, retrofuturism suggests a world which may be more comfortable or at least more capable of being understood while<!--also--> evoking \"nostalgia for a time of forward-looking hope and romance\".<ref name=handbook>{{cite book |last1=Latham |first1=Rob |title=The Oxford Handbook of Science Fiction |date=2014 |isbn=9780199838844 }}</ref><!--subsequently to the increasingly prevalent realist, modern and often dystopian imaginations of the future; and also in the vain of said by ridiculing these past imaginations and showcasing their absurdity by comparing them to present reality-->\n\nA similar theme is dissatisfaction with the modern world itself. A world of high-speed air transport, computers, and space stations is (by any past standard) \"futuristic\"; yet the search for alternative and perhaps more promising futures suggests a feeling that the desired or expected future has failed to materialize. Retrofuturism suggests an alternative path, and in addition to pure nostalgia, may act as a reminder of older but now forgotten ideals. This dissatisfaction also manifests as political commentary in Retrofuturistic literature,<ref name=\"edgeonthenet.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.edgeonthenet.com/style/fashion/131408/retro_futurism_is_latest_fashion_sensation |title=Retro Futurism Is Latest Fashion Sensation |work=EDGE United States |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061121/http://www.edgeonthenet.com/style/fashion/131408/retro_futurism_is_latest_fashion_sensation |archivedate=2013-10-23 }}</ref> in which visionary nostalgia is paradoxically linked to a utopian future modelled after conservative values<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/conversations/7867/steampunk_101_on_the_import_o.html |title=Steampunk 101: On the import of retro-futurism. - A conversation on TED.com |work=ted.com}}</ref> as seen in the example of Fox News' use of [[BioShock]]'s aesthetic in a 2014 broadcast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/07/03/fox-news-quite-likes-the-bioshock-infinite-logo-apparently |title=Fox News Quite Likes The BioShock Infinite Logo Apparently |work=IGN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2014/07/03/fox-news-uses-bioshock-infinite-logo-ken-levine-calls-it-irony/ |title=Fox News Uses 'BioShock Infinite' Logo, Ken Levine Calls It 'Irony' |author=Erik Kain |date=3 July 2014 |work=Forbes |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911070902/http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2014/07/03/fox-news-uses-bioshock-infinite-logo-ken-levine-calls-it-irony/ |archivedate=11 September 2014 }}</ref>\n\nRetrofuturism also implies a reevaluation of technology. Unlike the total rejection of post-medieval technology found in most [[fantasy]] genres, or the embrace of any and all possible technologies found in some science-fiction, retrofuturism calls for a human-scale, largely comprehensible technology, amenable to tinkering and less opaque than modern black-box technology.\n\nRetrofuturism is not universally optimistic, and when its points of reference touch on gloomy periods like [[World War II]], or the paranoia of the [[Cold War]], it may itself become bleak and dystopian. In such cases, the alternative reality inspires fear, not hope, though it may still be coupled with nostalgia for a world of greater moral as well as mechanical transparency.\n\n==Genres==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\nGenres of retrofuturism include [[steampunk]], [[dieselpunk]], [[Dieselpunk#Atompunk|atompunk]], [[Raygun Gothic]], and [[cyberpunk]], each referring to a technology from a specific time period.\n\nThe first of these to be named and recognized as its own genre was cyberpunk, originating in the early to mid-1980s in literature with the works of [[Bruce Bethke]], [[William Gibson]], [[Bruce Sterling]], and [[Pat Cadigan]]. Its setting is almost always a dystopian future, with a strong emphasis either upon outlaws hacking the futuristic world's machinery (often computers and computer networks), or even upon [[post-apocalyptic]] settings. The post-apocalyptic variant is the one usually associated with retrofuturism, where characters will rely upon a mixture of old and new technologies. Furthermore, [[Synthwave (2000s genre)|synthwave]] and [[vaporwave]] are nostalgic, humorous and often retrofuturistic revivals of early cyberpunk aesthetic<!--(via music, music videos, imagery, film and video games)-->.\n\nThe second to be named and recognized was steampunk, in the late 1980s. It is generally more optimistic and brighter than cyberpunk, set within an alternate history closely resembling our [[Long 19th century]] from circa the [[Regency era]] onwards and up to circa 1914, only that 20th-century or even futuristic technologies are based upon [[steam power]]. The genre themes also often involve references to electricity as a yet-as-of-now mysterious force that is considered the utopian power source of the future and sometimes even regarded as possessing mystical healing powers (much as with nuclear energy around the middle of the 20th century). The genre often strongly resembles the original [[scientific romances]] and [[utopian fiction|utopic novels]] of genre predecessors [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Jules Verne]], and began in its modern form with literature such as [[Mervyn Peake]]'s ''[[Titus Alone]]'' (1959), [[Ronald W. Clark]]'s ''[[Queen Victoria's Bomb]]'' (1967), [[Michael Moorcock]]'s ''[[A Nomad of the Time Streams]]'' series (1971\u20131981), [[K. W. Jeter]]'s ''[[Morlock Night]]'' (1979), and William Gibson & Bruce Sterling's ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' (1990), and with films such as ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]'' (1960) or ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' (1986). A notable early example of steampunk in comics is the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian]] graphic novel series ''[[Les Cit\u00e9s obscures]]'', started by its creators [[Fran\u00e7ois Schuiten]] and [[Beno\u00eet Peeters]] in the early 1980s. At times, steampunk as a genre crosses into that of [[Weird West]].\n\nThe most recently named and recognized retrofuturistic genre is dieselpunk aka decodence (the term dieselpunk is often associated with a more pulpish form and decodence, named after the contemporary art movement of [[Art Deco]], with a more sophisticated form), set in alternate versions of an era located circa in the period of the 1920s\u20131950s. Early examples include the 1970s concept albums, their designs and marketing materials of the German band [[Kraftwerk]] (see below), the comic-book character [[Rocketeer]] (first appearing in his own series in 1982), the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series of video games, and films such as ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), ''[[The Rocketeer (film)|The Rocketeer]]'' (1991), ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]'' (1994), ''[[The City of Lost Children]]'' (1995), and ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'' (1998). Especially the lower end of the genre strongly mimic the pulp literature of the era (such as the 2004 film ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]''), and films of the genre often reference the cinematic styles of [[film noir]] and [[German Expressionism]]. At times, the genre overlaps with the [[alternate history]] genre of a different [[World War II]], such as with an [[Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II|Axis victory]].\n\n==Design and arts==\nAlthough loosely affiliated with early-twentieth century Futurism, retrofuturism draws from a wider range of sources.  To be sure, retrofuturist art and literature often draws from the factories, buildings, cities, and transportation systems of the machine age. But it might be said that 20th century futuristic vision found its ultimate expression in the development of [[Googie architecture|Googie or Populuxe]] design. As applied to fiction, this brand of retrofuturistic visual style began to take shape in William Gibson's short story \"The Gernsback Continuum\".  Here and elsewhere it is referred to as [[Raygun Gothic]], a catchall term for a visual style that incorporates various aspects of the Googie, [[Streamline Moderne]], and [[Art Deco]] architectural styles when applied to retrofuturistic [[science fiction]] environments.\n\nAlthough Raygun Gothic is most similar to the Googie or Populuxe style and sometimes synonymous with it, the name is primarily applied to images of science fiction. The style is also still a popular choice for retro sci-fi in film and video games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Retro Futurism At Its Best: Designs and Tutorials |author=Sharon Ross |date=June 8, 2009 |work=Smashing Magazine |url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/08/retro-futurism-at-its-best-designs-and-tutorials |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812010219/http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/08/retro-futurism-at-its-best-designs-and-tutorials/ |archivedate=August 12, 2010 }}</ref> Raygun Gothic's primary influences include the set designs of [[Kenneth Strickfaden]] and [[Fritz Lang]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The term was coined by [[William Gibson]] in his story \"[[The Gernsback Continuum]]\": \"Cohen introduced us and explained that Dialta [a noted pop-art historian] was the prime mover behind the latest Barris-Watford project, an illustrated history of what she called 'American Streamlined Modern'.

Designers like David King in the UK and Paula Scher in the US imitated the cool, futuristic look of the Russian avant-garde in the years following the Russian Revolution.\n\nWith three of their 1970s albums, German band [[Kraftwerk]] tapped into a larger retrofuturist vision, by combining their futuristic pioneering electronic music with nostalgic visuals. Kraftwerk's retro-futurism in their 1970s visual language has been referred to by German literary critic Uwe Sch\u00fctte, a reader at [[Aston University]], Birmingham, as \"clear retro-style\",<ref>Sch\u00fctte, Uwe (2015). [https://theconversation.com/why-i-want-to-offer-a-university-course-on-kraftwerk-36160 ''Why I want to offer a university course on Kraftwerk''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116121328/https://theconversation.com/why-i-want-to-offer-a-university-course-on-kraftwerk-36160 |date=2015-11-16 }}, [[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]], 4 February 2015</ref> and in the 2008 three-hour documentary ''Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution'', Irish-British music scholar Mark J. Prendergast refers to Kraftwerk's peculiar \"nostalgia for the future\" clearly referencing \"an interwar ''[progressive]'' Germany that never was but could've been, and now ''[due to their influence as a band]'' hopefully could happen again\". Design historian Elizabeth Guffey has written that if Kraftwerk's machine imagery was lifted from Russian design motifs that were once considered futuristic, they also presented a \"compelling, if somewhat chilling, vision of the world in which musical ecstasy is rendered cool, mechanical and precise.\"<ref>Guffey, 141.</ref> Kraftwerk's three retrofuturist albums are:\n\n*Kraftwerk's 1975 album ''[[Radio-Activity]]'' showed a contemporary 1930s radio on the cover, its inlay (which for its later CD re-release was widely expanded as a booklet illustrated in the same nostalgic style) showed the band photographed in black and white with old-fashioned suits and hairdos, and the music in its instrumentation as well as its ambiguous lyrics were (besides the other obvious theme of [[radioactive decay|nuclear decay]] and [[nuclear power]] referenced by the album's titular pun) in hommage to the \"Radio Stars\", that is the pioneers of electronic music of the first half of the 20th century, such as [[Guglielmo Marconi]], [[L\u00e9on Theremin]], [[Pierre Schaeffer]], and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] (due to whom the band referred to themselves as but the \"second generation\" of electronic music).\n*The European version of the band's 1977 album ''[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]'' had a similar 1930s-style black and white photo of the band members on the cover (the U.S. version even had a cover of a vintage-style colored photograph in the style of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age]] Hollywood stars), the style of the sleeve design as well as the design of promotional material tying in with the album were influenced by [[Bauhaus]], [[Art Deco]], and [[Streamline Moderne]], the record came with a large, hand-tinted black and white poster of the band members in early-1930s style suits (where band member [[Karl Bartos]] later said in ''Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution'' that their intention was to visually resemble \"an interwar string orchestra electrified\" and that the background was meant to be a pictorial Switzerland where the band was making a resting stop in-between two legs of their European tour on the eponymous ''Trans-Europe Express''), the song lyrics referenced the \"elegance and decadence\" of an urban interwar Europe, and in the promo clip made for the album's title song (shot in black and white on purpose) and other promotional material, the eponymous ''Trans-Europe Express'' was portrayed by the ''[[Schienenzeppelin]]'' first employed by the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] in 1931 (footage of the large original was used in outdoor shots, and a miniature model of it was used for shots where the TEE moved through a futuristic cityscape strongly reminiscent of [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'').\n*The cover and sleeve design of the 1978 album ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' exhibits an obvious stylistic nod to the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] of 1920s artists such as [[El Lissitzky]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]], and [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy]] (due to which band members have also referred to it as \"the Russian album\"), and one song references the film ''Metropolis'' again. From this album on, Kraftwerk would also use their \"show-room dummies\" aka robot lookalikes on stage and in promotional material and increase the use of slightly [[Camp (style)|campish]] make-up on band members that also resembled 1920s' [[German expressionism|expressionist]] make-up that to a lesser degree had already appeared in the promotional material for their 1977 album ''Trans-Europe Express''.\n\nFrom their 1981 album ''[[Computer World]]'' onwards, Kraftwerk have largely abandoned their retro notions and appear mainly futuristic only. The only references to their earlier retro style today appear in excerpts from their 1970s' promo clips that are projected in between more modern segments in their stage shows during the performance of these old song.\n\n===Fashion===\n{{See also|PVC clothing}}\nFuturistic clothing is a particular imagined vision of the clothing that might be worn in the distant future, typically found in science fiction and science fiction films of the 1940s onwards, but also in journalism and other popular culture. The garments envisioned have most commonly been either one-piece garments, skin-tight garments, or both, typically ending up looking like either overalls or leotards, often worn together with plastic boots. In many cases, there is an assumption that the clothing of the future will be highly uniform.\n\nThe clich\u00e9 of futuristic clothing has now become part of the idea of retrofuturism. Futuristic fashion plays on these now-hackneyed stereotypes, and recycles them as elements into the creation of real-world clothing fashions.\n\n\"We've actually seen this look creeping up on the runway as early as 1995, though it hasn't been widely popular or acceptable street wear even through 2008,\" said Brooke Kelley, fashion editor and ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine writer. \"For the last 20 years, fashion has reviewed the times of past, decade by decade, and what we are seeing now is a combination of different eras into one complete look. Future fashion is a style beyond anything we've yet dared to wear, and it's going to be a trend setter's paradise.\" <ref name=\"edgeonthenet.com\"/>\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Radisson Shanghai.jpg|thumb|An example in [[Shanghai]] of a retrofuturistic design in architecture]]\n\nRetrofuturism has appeared in some examples of [[postmodern architecture]].

In avant-garde artistic, literary and design circles, futurism is a long-standing and well established term.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} But in its more popular form, futurism (sometimes referred to as [[futurology]]) is \"an early optimism that focused on the past and was rooted in the nineteenth century, an early-twentieth-century 'golden age' that continued long into the 1960s' [[Space Age]]\". <ref>Elizabeth Guffey and Kate C. Lemay, \"Retrofuturism and Steampunk\", The Oxford Handbook to Science Fiction, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 435.</ref>\n\nRetrofuturism is first and foremost based on modern but changing notions of \"the future\".  As Guffey notes, retrofuturism is \"a recent neologism\", but it \"builds on futurists' fevered visions of space colonies with flying cars, robotic servants, and interstellar travel on display there; where futurists took their promise for granted, retro-futurism emerged as a more skeptical reaction to these dreams\".<ref>Elizabeth Guffey, \"Crafting Yesterday's Tomorrows: Retro-Futurism, Steampunk, and Making in the Twenty-First Century\", ''Journal of Modern Craft'' 7.3 (November, 2014) p. 254.</ref> It took its current shape in the 1970s, a time when technology was rapidly changing. From the advent of the personal computer to the birth of the first test tube baby, this period was characterized by intense and rapid technological change. But many in the general public began to question whether applied science would achieve its earlier promise\u2014that life would inevitably improve through technological progress. In the wake of the Vietnam War, environmental depredations, and the energy crisis, many commentators began to question the benefits of applied science. But they also wondered, sometimes in awe, sometimes in confusion, at the scientific positivism evinced by earlier generations. Retrofuturism \"seeped into academic and popular culture in the 1960s and 1970s\", inflecting [[George Lucas]]'s ''Star Wars'' and the paintings of pop artist [[Kenny Scharf]] alike\".<ref>Elizabeth Guffey, ''Retro: The Culture of Revival'' (Reaktion: 2006):155\u2013157</ref> Surveying the optimistic futurism of the early twentieth century, the historians Joe Corn and Brian Horrigan remind us that retrofuturism is \"a history of an idea, or a system of ideas\u2014an ideology. The future, or course, does not exist except as an act of belief or imagination.\"<ref>Joseph J. Corn and Brian Horrigan, ''Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Visions of the American Future'' (Johns Hopkins Press: 1984): xii.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:CaptainMarvelJrNo17.jpg|thumb|Retrofuturistic cities were popular subject in [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age comic books]]. From ''[[Captain Marvel Jr]]'' number 17 (March 1944); artwork by [[Mac Raboy]] ]]\n\nRetrofuturism incorporates two overlapping trends which may be summarized as ''the future as seen from the past'' and ''the past as seen from the future''.\n\nThe first trend, retrofuturism proper, is directly inspired by the imagined future which existed in the minds of writers, artists, and filmmakers in the pre-1960 period who attempted to predict the future, either in serious projections of existing technology (e.g. in magazines like ''[[Science and Invention]]'') or in [[science fiction]] novels and stories. Such futuristic visions are refurbished and updated for the present, and offer a nostalgic, counterfactual image of what the future might have been, but is not.\n\nThe second trend is the inverse of the first: futuristic [[retro]]. It starts with the retro appeal of old styles of art, clothing, mores, and then grafts modern or futuristic technologies onto it, creating a m\u00e9lange of past, present, and future elements. [[Steampunk]], a term applying both to the retrojection of futuristic technology into an alternative Victorian age, and the application of neo-Victorian styles to modern technology, is a highly successful version of this second trend. In the movie ''[[Space Station 76]]'' (2014), mankind has reached the stars, but clothes, technology, furnitures and above all social taboos are purposely highly reminiscent of the mid-1970s.\n\nIn practice, the two trends cannot be sharply distinguished, as they mutually contribute to similar visions. Retrofuturism of the first type is inevitably influenced by the scientific, technological, and social awareness of the present, and modern retrofuturistic creations are never simply copies of their pre-1960 inspirations; rather, they are given a new (often wry or ironic) twist by being seen from a modern perspective.\n\nIn the same way, futuristic retro owes much of its flavor to early [[science fiction]] (e.g. the works of [[Jules Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells]]), and in a quest for stylistic authenticity may continue to draw on writers and artists of the desired period.\n\nBoth retrofuturistic trends in themselves refer to no specific time. When a time period is supplied for a story, it might be a counterfactual present with unique technology; a fantastic version of the future; or an alternate past in which the imagined (fictitious or projected) inventions of the past were indeed real. Examples include the film ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'', set in an imaginary 1939, and ''[[Rocketeer|The Rocketeer]]'' franchise, set in 1938, both of which are also examples of the genre known as [[dieselpunk]].<ref name=\"Discovering Dieselpunk p3\">{{Citation|url=http://www.ottens.co.uk/gatehouse/Gazette%20-%201.pdf |title=Discovering Dieselpunk |last=Piecraft |first2=Nick |last2=Ottens |journal=The Gatehouse Gazette |issue=Issue 1 |date=July 2008 |pages=4, 8, 9 |accessdate=2012-10-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229235716/http://www.ottens.co.uk/gatehouse/Gazette%20-%201.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-29 }}</ref> [[Adam Reed]]'s animated comedy series [[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]] is also set in a retrofuture aesthetic world.<br/>\nThe import of retrofuturism has, in recent years, come under considerable discussion.

In some respects, an extrapolation of the present to the future produces disappointing, or even ghastly results, exemplified in [[cyberpunk]] and other [[dystopia]]n futures often characterized by overpopulation, environmental degradation, societal degradation<!--/decay--> and transfer of power to unaccountable private entities or governments. Compared to such imaginations of the future, retrofuturism suggests a world which may be more comfortable or at least more capable of being understood while<!--also--> evoking \"nostalgia for a time of forward-looking hope and romance\".<ref name=handbook>{{cite book |last1=Latham |first1=Rob |title=The Oxford Handbook of Science Fiction |date=2014 |isbn=9780199838844 }}</ref><!--subsequently to the increasingly prevalent realist, modern and often dystopian imaginations of the future; and also in the vain of said by ridiculing these past imaginations and showcasing their absurdity by comparing them to present reality-->\n\nA similar theme is dissatisfaction with the modern world itself. A world of high-speed air transport, computers, and space stations is (by any past standard) \"futuristic\"; yet the search for alternative and perhaps more promising futures suggests a feeling that the desired or expected future has failed to materialize. Retrofuturism suggests an alternative path, and in addition to pure nostalgia, may act as a reminder of older but now forgotten ideals. This dissatisfaction also manifests as political commentary in Retrofuturistic literature,<ref name=\"edgeonthenet.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.edgeonthenet.com/style/fashion/131408/retro_futurism_is_latest_fashion_sensation |title=Retro Futurism Is Latest Fashion Sensation |work=EDGE United States |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061121/http://www.edgeonthenet.com/style/fashion/131408/retro_futurism_is_latest_fashion_sensation |archivedate=2013-10-23 }}</ref> in which visionary nostalgia is paradoxically linked to a utopian future modelled after conservative values<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ted.com/conversations/7867/steampunk_101_on_the_import_o.html |title=Steampunk 101: On the import of retro-futurism. - A conversation on TED.com |work=ted.com}}</ref> as seen in the example of Fox News' use of [[BioShock]]'s aesthetic in a 2014 broadcast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/07/03/fox-news-quite-likes-the-bioshock-infinite-logo-apparently |title=Fox News Quite Likes The BioShock Infinite Logo Apparently |work=IGN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2014/07/03/fox-news-uses-bioshock-infinite-logo-ken-levine-calls-it-irony/ |title=Fox News Uses 'BioShock Infinite' Logo, Ken Levine Calls It 'Irony' |author=Erik Kain |date=3 July 2014 |work=Forbes |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911070902/http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2014/07/03/fox-news-uses-bioshock-infinite-logo-ken-levine-calls-it-irony/ |archivedate=11 September 2014 }}</ref>\n\nRetrofuturism also implies a reevaluation of technology. Unlike the total rejection of post-medieval technology found in most [[fantasy]] genres, or the embrace of any and all possible technologies found in some science-fiction, retrofuturism calls for a human-scale, largely comprehensible technology, amenable to tinkering and less opaque than modern black-box technology.\n\nRetrofuturism is not universally optimistic, and when its points of reference touch on gloomy periods like [[World War II]], or the paranoia of the [[Cold War]], it may itself become bleak and dystopian. In such cases, the alternative reality inspires fear, not hope, though it may still be coupled with nostalgia for a world of greater moral as well as mechanical transparency.\n\n==Genres==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\nGenres of retrofuturism include [[steampunk]], [[dieselpunk]], [[Dieselpunk#Atompunk|atompunk]], [[Raygun Gothic]], and [[cyberpunk]], each referring to a technology from a specific time period.\n\nThe first of these to be named and recognized as its own genre was cyberpunk, originating in the early to mid-1980s in literature with the works of [[Bruce Bethke]], [[William Gibson]], [[Bruce Sterling]], and [[Pat Cadigan]]. Its setting is almost always a dystopian future, with a strong emphasis either upon outlaws hacking the futuristic world's machinery (often computers and computer networks), or even upon [[post-apocalyptic]] settings. The post-apocalyptic variant is the one usually associated with retrofuturism, where characters will rely upon a mixture of old and new technologies. Furthermore, [[Synthwave (2000s genre)|synthwave]] and [[vaporwave]] are nostalgic, humorous and often retrofuturistic revivals of early cyberpunk aesthetic<!--(via music, music videos, imagery, film and video games)-->.\n\nThe second to be named and recognized was steampunk, in the late 1980s. It is generally more optimistic and brighter than cyberpunk, set within an alternate history closely resembling our [[Long 19th century]] from circa the [[Regency era]] onwards and up to circa 1914, only that 20th-century or even futuristic technologies are based upon [[steam power]]. The genre themes also often involve references to electricity as a yet-as-of-now mysterious force that is considered the utopian power source of the future and sometimes even regarded as possessing mystical healing powers (much as with nuclear energy around the middle of the 20th century). The genre often strongly resembles the original [[scientific romances]] and [[utopian fiction|utopic novels]] of genre predecessors [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Jules Verne]], and began in its modern form with literature such as [[Mervyn Peake]]'s ''[[Titus Alone]]'' (1959), [[Ronald W. Clark]]'s ''[[Queen Victoria's Bomb]]'' (1967), [[Michael Moorcock]]'s ''[[A Nomad of the Time Streams]]'' series (1971\u20131981), [[K. W. Jeter]]'s ''[[Morlock Night]]'' (1979), and William Gibson & Bruce Sterling's ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' (1990), and with films such as ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]'' (1960) or ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' (1986). A notable early example of steampunk in comics is the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian]] graphic novel series ''[[Les Cit\u00e9s obscures]]'', started by its creators [[Fran\u00e7ois Schuiten]] and [[Beno\u00eet Peeters]] in the early 1980s. At times, steampunk as a genre crosses into that of [[Weird West]].\n\nThe most recently named and recognized retrofuturistic genre is dieselpunk aka decodence (the term dieselpunk is often associated with a more pulpish form and decodence, named after the contemporary art movement of [[Art Deco]], with a more sophisticated form), set in alternate versions of an era located circa in the period of the 1920s\u20131950s. Early examples include the 1970s concept albums, their designs and marketing materials of the German band [[Kraftwerk]] (see below), the comic-book character [[Rocketeer]] (first appearing in his own series in 1982), the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series of video games, and films such as ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), ''[[The Rocketeer (film)|The Rocketeer]]'' (1991), ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]'' (1994), ''[[The City of Lost Children]]'' (1995), and ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'' (1998). Especially the lower end of the genre strongly mimic the pulp literature of the era (such as the 2004 film ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]''), and films of the genre often reference the cinematic styles of [[film noir]] and [[German Expressionism]]. At times, the genre overlaps with the [[alternate history]] genre of a different [[World War II]], such as with an [[Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II|Axis victory]].\n\n==Design and arts==\nAlthough loosely affiliated with early-twentieth century Futurism, retrofuturism draws from a wider range of sources.  To be sure, retrofuturist art and literature often draws from the factories, buildings, cities, and transportation systems of the machine age. But it might be said that 20th century futuristic vision found its ultimate expression in the development of [[Googie architecture|Googie or Populuxe]] design. As applied to fiction, this brand of retrofuturistic visual style began to take shape in William Gibson's short story \"The Gernsback Continuum\".  Here and elsewhere it is referred to as [[Raygun Gothic]], a catchall term for a visual style that incorporates various aspects of the Googie, [[Streamline Moderne]], and [[Art Deco]] architectural styles when applied to retrofuturistic [[science fiction]] environments.\n\nAlthough Raygun Gothic is most similar to the Googie or Populuxe style and sometimes synonymous with it, the name is primarily applied to images of science fiction. The style is also still a popular choice for retro sci-fi in film and video games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Retro Futurism At Its Best: Designs and Tutorials |author=Sharon Ross |date=June 8, 2009 |work=Smashing Magazine |url=http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/08/retro-futurism-at-its-best-designs-and-tutorials |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812010219/http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/08/retro-futurism-at-its-best-designs-and-tutorials/ |archivedate=August 12, 2010 }}</ref> Raygun Gothic's primary influences include the set designs of [[Kenneth Strickfaden]] and [[Fritz Lang]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The term was coined by [[William Gibson]] in his story \"[[The Gernsback Continuum]]\": \"Cohen introduced us and explained that Dialta [a noted pop-art historian] was the prime mover behind the latest Barris-Watford project, an illustrated history of what she called 'American Streamlined Modern'. Cohen called it 'raygun Gothic'.

Designers like David King in the UK and Paula Scher in the US imitated the cool, futuristic look of the Russian avant-garde in the years following the Russian Revolution.\n\nWith three of their 1970s albums, German band [[Kraftwerk]] tapped into a larger retrofuturist vision, by combining their futuristic pioneering electronic music with nostalgic visuals. Kraftwerk's retro-futurism in their 1970s visual language has been referred to by German literary critic Uwe Sch\u00fctte, a reader at [[Aston University]], Birmingham, as \"clear retro-style\",<ref>Sch\u00fctte, Uwe (2015). [https://theconversation.com/why-i-want-to-offer-a-university-course-on-kraftwerk-36160 ''Why I want to offer a university course on Kraftwerk''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116121328/https://theconversation.com/why-i-want-to-offer-a-university-course-on-kraftwerk-36160 |date=2015-11-16 }}, [[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]], 4 February 2015</ref> and in the 2008 three-hour documentary ''Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution'', Irish-British music scholar Mark J. Prendergast refers to Kraftwerk's peculiar \"nostalgia for the future\" clearly referencing \"an interwar ''[progressive]'' Germany that never was but could've been, and now ''[due to their influence as a band]'' hopefully could happen again\". Design historian Elizabeth Guffey has written that if Kraftwerk's machine imagery was lifted from Russian design motifs that were once considered futuristic, they also presented a \"compelling, if somewhat chilling, vision of the world in which musical ecstasy is rendered cool, mechanical and precise.\"<ref>Guffey, 141.</ref> Kraftwerk's three retrofuturist albums are:\n\n*Kraftwerk's 1975 album ''[[Radio-Activity]]'' showed a contemporary 1930s radio on the cover, its inlay (which for its later CD re-release was widely expanded as a booklet illustrated in the same nostalgic style) showed the band photographed in black and white with old-fashioned suits and hairdos, and the music in its instrumentation as well as its ambiguous lyrics were (besides the other obvious theme of [[radioactive decay|nuclear decay]] and [[nuclear power]] referenced by the album's titular pun) in hommage to the \"Radio Stars\", that is the pioneers of electronic music of the first half of the 20th century, such as [[Guglielmo Marconi]], [[L\u00e9on Theremin]], [[Pierre Schaeffer]], and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] (due to whom the band referred to themselves as but the \"second generation\" of electronic music).\n*The European version of the band's 1977 album ''[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]'' had a similar 1930s-style black and white photo of the band members on the cover (the U.S. version even had a cover of a vintage-style colored photograph in the style of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age]] Hollywood stars), the style of the sleeve design as well as the design of promotional material tying in with the album were influenced by [[Bauhaus]], [[Art Deco]], and [[Streamline Moderne]], the record came with a large, hand-tinted black and white poster of the band members in early-1930s style suits (where band member [[Karl Bartos]] later said in ''Kraftwerk and the Electronic Revolution'' that their intention was to visually resemble \"an interwar string orchestra electrified\" and that the background was meant to be a pictorial Switzerland where the band was making a resting stop in-between two legs of their European tour on the eponymous ''Trans-Europe Express''), the song lyrics referenced the \"elegance and decadence\" of an urban interwar Europe, and in the promo clip made for the album's title song (shot in black and white on purpose) and other promotional material, the eponymous ''Trans-Europe Express'' was portrayed by the ''[[Schienenzeppelin]]'' first employed by the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] in 1931 (footage of the large original was used in outdoor shots, and a miniature model of it was used for shots where the TEE moved through a futuristic cityscape strongly reminiscent of [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'').\n*The cover and sleeve design of the 1978 album ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' exhibits an obvious stylistic nod to the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] of 1920s artists such as [[El Lissitzky]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]], and [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy]] (due to which band members have also referred to it as \"the Russian album\"), and one song references the film ''Metropolis'' again. From this album on, Kraftwerk would also use their \"show-room dummies\" aka robot lookalikes on stage and in promotional material and increase the use of slightly [[Camp (style)|campish]] make-up on band members that also resembled 1920s' [[German expressionism|expressionist]] make-up that to a lesser degree had already appeared in the promotional material for their 1977 album ''Trans-Europe Express''.\n\nFrom their 1981 album ''[[Computer World]]'' onwards, Kraftwerk have largely abandoned their retro notions and appear mainly futuristic only. The only references to their earlier retro style today appear in excerpts from their 1970s' promo clips that are projected in between more modern segments in their stage shows during the performance of these old song.\n\n===Fashion===\n{{See also|PVC clothing}}\nFuturistic clothing is a particular imagined vision of the clothing that might be worn in the distant future, typically found in science fiction and science fiction films of the 1940s onwards, but also in journalism and other popular culture. The garments envisioned have most commonly been either one-piece garments, skin-tight garments, or both, typically ending up looking like either overalls or leotards, often worn together with plastic boots. In many cases, there is an assumption that the clothing of the future will be highly uniform.\n\nThe clich\u00e9 of futuristic clothing has now become part of the idea of retrofuturism. Futuristic fashion plays on these now-hackneyed stereotypes, and recycles them as elements into the creation of real-world clothing fashions.\n\n\"We've actually seen this look creeping up on the runway as early as 1995, though it hasn't been widely popular or acceptable street wear even through 2008,\" said Brooke Kelley, fashion editor and ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine writer. \"For the last 20 years, fashion has reviewed the times of past, decade by decade, and what we are seeing now is a combination of different eras into one complete look. Future fashion is a style beyond anything we've yet dared to wear, and it's going to be a trend setter's paradise.\" <ref name=\"edgeonthenet.com\"/>\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Radisson Shanghai.jpg|thumb|An example in [[Shanghai]] of a retrofuturistic design in architecture]]\n\nRetrofuturism has appeared in some examples of [[postmodern architecture]]. To critics such as {{ill|Niklas Maak|de}}, the term suggests that the \"future style\" is \"a mere quotation of its own iconographic tradition\" and retrofuturism is little more than \"an aesthetic feedback loop\"<ref>Maak, op cit.</ref> In the example seen at right, the upper portion of the building is not intended to be integrated with the building but rather to appear as a separate object \u2013 a huge [[flying saucer]]-like [[space ship]] only incidentally attached to a conventional building.

The film is a box hit and celebrated 100 days, despite releasing  only 6 days after Bhatti vikramarka.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with [[Narakasura]] born to [[Bh\u016bmi|Bhoodevi]] (Savitri) and [[Lord Vishnu]] (N. T. Rama Rao) during the time of ''[[Varaha|Varaha Avatar]]'', a wild boar form. Narakasura (S. V. Ranga Rao) conquers the entire world and makes Prakjothishapuram as his capital. He also wants to conquer heaven, so, he does penance for [[Lord Siva]] and gets a boon that except for his mother Bhoodevi, no one else can kill him. Narakasura then wins over the entire universe and takes [[Aditi|Deva Maata Aditi Devi]]'s (Rushyendramani) earrings and all heavenly ladies to his capital in a procession. Nagadatta (Gummadi) is a citizen at Prakjothishapuram and a great devotee of Lord Vishnu. Unfortunately, his son comes into the procession and dies under a chariot. Nagadatta opposes the cruelty of Narakasura and he is arrested. In spite of Nagadatta's daughter, Vasumathi (S. Varalakshmi) requests Narakasura to keep a deaf ear. Distressed, Vasumathi bangs her head to Siva's idol and she is cursed by a Saint to become a snake. When she explains to him about her condition, the Saint tells him she can take revenge on Narakasura in snake form. Nagadatta escapes from jail and reaches Dwaraka along with Vasumathi, where Lord Vishnu has taken birth as [[Lord Krishna]]. Narakasura comes to know regarding this, in disguise, he reaches Dwaraka, marries Vasumathi by cheating and takes them back. Narakasura imprisons Nagadatta again. Vasumathi realizes that she is married to Narakasura, but she turns obedient to him. Narakasura's atrocities increase day by day by which both gods and humans are suffering. Narada (Kanta Rao) reaches the earth and requests Krishna to put an end to it and restore peace, but he replies that he can't do so because of his word, which was given to Bhoodevi.\n\nMeanwhile, Vasumathi gives birth to Bhagadatta. Vasumati tells her father that she will make his son as a devotee to Lord Krishna. Listening to this, Narakasura becomes angry and arrests Vasumathi too. Krishna appears to Nagadatta in the prison and is caught by soldiers. Krishna then transforms himself into Narada and develops devotion towards Krishna among soldiers. Meanwhile, Satyabhama could not find Krishna in the palace, she accuses Narada that he is trying to separate Krishna from her. Krishna comes there and tells her about Narakasura's misdeeds and orders Narada to observe his actions. Narakasura comes to Dwaraka in Krishna's attire and takes away all the girls from there. The public suspects Krishna and they plead to Satyabhama for their daughters. Krishna tells her that it is the atrocity of Narakasura. Satyabhama says that they have to take revenge over this. At the same time, Nagadatta escapes with Vasumathi. Narakasura catches them and removes Nagadatta's eyes. Narada takes him to Krishna. Every one requests Krishna to see the end of Narakasura. Krishna starts for war. Vasumathi obstructs Narakasura and he runs a chariot over her. Satyabhama accompanies Krishna in war. During the time of war, Krishna pretends as if he has fainted. Then Satyabhama takes the arrow and grounds Narakasura. Then he realizes that Satyabhama is none other than his mother Bhoodevi. Satyabhama requests Krishna to make Narakasura's name permanent then Krishna says that on the day when Narakasura realized his soul, people will celebrate Deepavali by lighting the lamps.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[N.

T. Rama Rao as Lord Krishna. The film is a box hit and celebrated 100 days, despite releasing  only 6 days after Bhatti vikramarka.  \n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with [[Narakasura]] born to [[Bh\u016bmi|Bhoodevi]] (Savitri) and [[Lord Vishnu]] (N. T. Rama Rao) during the time of ''[[Varaha|Varaha Avatar]]'', a wild boar form. Narakasura (S. V. Ranga Rao) conquers the entire world and makes Prakjothishapuram as his capital. He also wants to conquer heaven, so, he does penance for [[Lord Siva]] and gets a boon that except for his mother Bhoodevi, no one else can kill him. Narakasura then wins over the entire universe and takes [[Aditi|Deva Maata Aditi Devi]]'s (Rushyendramani) earrings and all heavenly ladies to his capital in a procession. Nagadatta (Gummadi) is a citizen at Prakjothishapuram and a great devotee of Lord Vishnu. Unfortunately, his son comes into the procession and dies under a chariot. Nagadatta opposes the cruelty of Narakasura and he is arrested. In spite of Nagadatta's daughter, Vasumathi (S. Varalakshmi) requests Narakasura to keep a deaf ear. Distressed, Vasumathi bangs her head to Siva's idol and she is cursed by a Saint to become a snake. When she explains to him about her condition, the Saint tells him she can take revenge on Narakasura in snake form. Nagadatta escapes from jail and reaches Dwaraka along with Vasumathi, where Lord Vishnu has taken birth as [[Lord Krishna]]. Narakasura comes to know regarding this, in disguise, he reaches Dwaraka, marries Vasumathi by cheating and takes them back. Narakasura imprisons Nagadatta again. Vasumathi realizes that she is married to Narakasura, but she turns obedient to him. Narakasura's atrocities increase day by day by which both gods and humans are suffering. Narada (Kanta Rao) reaches the earth and requests Krishna to put an end to it and restore peace, but he replies that he can't do so because of his word, which was given to Bhoodevi.\n\nMeanwhile, Vasumathi gives birth to Bhagadatta. Vasumati tells her father that she will make his son as a devotee to Lord Krishna. Listening to this, Narakasura becomes angry and arrests Vasumathi too. Krishna appears to Nagadatta in the prison and is caught by soldiers. Krishna then transforms himself into Narada and develops devotion towards Krishna among soldiers. Meanwhile, Satyabhama could not find Krishna in the palace, she accuses Narada that he is trying to separate Krishna from her. Krishna comes there and tells her about Narakasura's misdeeds and orders Narada to observe his actions. Narakasura comes to Dwaraka in Krishna's attire and takes away all the girls from there. The public suspects Krishna and they plead to Satyabhama for their daughters. Krishna tells her that it is the atrocity of Narakasura. Satyabhama says that they have to take revenge over this. At the same time, Nagadatta escapes with Vasumathi. Narakasura catches them and removes Nagadatta's eyes. Narada takes him to Krishna. Every one requests Krishna to see the end of Narakasura. Krishna starts for war. Vasumathi obstructs Narakasura and he runs a chariot over her. Satyabhama accompanies Krishna in war. During the time of war, Krishna pretends as if he has fainted. Then Satyabhama takes the arrow and grounds Narakasura. Then he realizes that Satyabhama is none other than his mother Bhoodevi. Satyabhama requests Krishna to make Narakasura's name permanent then Krishna says that on the day when Narakasura realized his soul, people will celebrate Deepavali by lighting the lamps.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[N.
