{"title_page": "Etymology of Arab", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Etymology of ''Arab''}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=December 2007}}\n{{Original research|date=October 2016}}\n}}\n{{Arab culture}}\nThe proper name '''''Arab''''' or '''''Arabian''''' (and cognates in other languages) has been used to translate several different but similar-sounding words in ancient and classical texts which do not necessarily have the same meaning or origin. The etymology of the term is closely linked to that of the place name ''[[Arabia]]''.  [[Gustave E. von Grunebaum]], in his book ''Classical Islam'' said that an approximate translation is ''passerby'' or ''[[nomad]]''.<ref>Grunebaum, p. 16</ref>\n\n==Semitic etymology==\nThe root of the word has many meanings in Semitic languages including ''desert'', ''nomad'', ''merchant'', ''raven'' and ''comprehensible'' with all of these having varying degrees of relevance to the emergence of the name. It is also possible that some forms were [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathetical]] from {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0628\u0631}} {{transl|sem|\u02bf-B-R}} \"moving around\", and hence, it is alleged, \"nomadic.\"\n\nThe plurality of meanings results partly from the assimilation of the [[proto-Semitic]] {{lang|ar|\u063a}} ''[[ghayin]]'' with {{lang|ar|\u0639}} {{transl|sem|''[[\u02bfayin]]''}} in some languages. In Hebrew the word {{Hebrew|\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1}} ''{{transl|sem|\u02bfarav}}'' thus has the [[homonym|same]] [[Triliteral|triconsonantal root]] as the root meaning \"west\" ({{Hebrew|\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1}} ''{{transl|sem|ma\u02bfarav}}'') \"setting sun\" or \"evening\" ({{Hebrew|\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1}} ''{{transl|sem|ma\u02bfariv}}'', {{Hebrew|\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1}} ''{{transl|sem|\u02bferev}}''). The direct Arabic cognate of this is {{lang|ar|\u063a\u0631\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[Al Gharbiyah (disambiguation)|\u0121arb]]}}'' (\"west\", etc.) rather than {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0631\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bfarab}}&#x202f;''; however, in [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Old South Arabian|Sayhadic]],<ref>Sabaic Dictionary (English-French-Arabic) p. 18, A.F.L. Beeston, W.W. Muller, M.A. Ghul, J. Ryckmans</ref> languages which normally preserve [[proto-Semitic]] ''[[ghayin]]'', this root is found with ''[[\u02bfayin]]'' adding to the confusion.<ref>If we assume that the word for \"evening\" was originally pronounced with ''[[\u02bfayin]]'', or that the distinction between ''[[\u02bfayin]]'' and ''[[ghayin]]'' was not phonemic, it could be connected with the \"mixture\" meaning, as evening is when day mixes with night.</ref> The first recorded use of the word is in Hebrew, Genesis 1:5, and its meaning there is \"evening.\"\n\n==In Arabic==\nThe oldest surviving indication of an Arab identity is an inscription made in early Arabic using the Nabatean Aramaic alphabet in 328 CE, which refers to [[Imru' al-Qays ibn 'Amr]] as \"King of all the Arabs\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Recent Research on the Late Antique Countryside|author1=William Bowden |author2=Luke Lavan |author3=Carlos Machado |year=2004|page=91|publisher=Brill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFhsk-ccTsAC&pg=PA91|isbn=9789004136076 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Islamic Societies|author=Ira M. Lapidus|year=2014|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFJNBAAAQBAJ|isbn=9780521514309}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Qur'an]], the word {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0631\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bfarab}}'' does not appear, only the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|nisba]] adjective, {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0651}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bfarabiyy-un&#x202f;}}'': The Qur'an is referring to itself as {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0651}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bfarabiyy-un}}'' \"Arabic\" and {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0628\u064a\u0646}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|mub\u012bn-un}}'' \"clear\". The two qualities are connected, for example in ayat [[Az-Zukhruf|43]].2-3, \"By the ''clear'' Book: We have made it an ''Arabic'' recitation in order that you may understand\", and the Qur'an came to be regarded as the prime example of {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-\u02bfarabiyyatu}}'', the language of the Arabs. The term ''[[I\u02bfrab|{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bei\u02bfr\u0101b}}]]'' is from the same root, referring to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. Bedouin elders still use this term with the same meaning; those whose speech they comprehend (i.e. Arabic-speakers) they call ''Arab'', and those whose speech is of unknown meaning to them, they call {{lang|ar|\u0639\u062c\u0645}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|\u02bf[[ajam]]}}'' (or {{lang|ar|\u0639\u062c\u0645\u064a}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|\u02bfajam\u012b&nbsp;}}''). In the [[Persian Gulf]] region, the term ''Ajam'' is often used to refer to the [[Persian people|Persians]].<ref>An analogy would be the distinction in Slavic languages between ''Slav'' (speaking people, from ''slovo'', word) and ''Niemiec'' (dumb people, used for the Germans).</ref>\n\nThe plural noun ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bea\u02bfr\u0101b}}'' refers to the [[Bedouin]] tribes of the desert who rejected Islam, for example in ayat [[At-Tawba|9]]:97,\n:{{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0623\u0634\u062f\u0651 \u0643\u0641\u0631\u064b\u0627 \u0648 \u0646\u0641\u0627\u0642\u064b\u0627}}\n:''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-\u02bea\u02bfr\u0101b-u \u02bea\u0161add-u kufr-an wa-nif\u0101q-an}}''<br /> \"the Bedouin are the worst in [[kafir|disbelief]] and [[Nifaq|hypocrisy]]\".\nBased on this, in early Islamic terminology, {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0631\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bfarab}}'' referred to sedentary Arabs, living in cities such as Mecca and Medina, and {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bea\u02bfr\u0101b}}'' referred to the Arab Bedouins, carrying a negative connotation as shown in the prior Qur'anic verse. Following the [[Islamic conquest]] of the 8th century, however, the language of the nomadic Arabs came to be regarded as preserving the highest purity by the grammarians following [[Abi Ishaq]], and the term {{lang|ar|\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kalam al-\u02bfArab}}'' \"language of the Arabs\" came to denote the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins.\n\n:''Cf. the modern toponyms [[Algarve]] and [[Arava (disambiguation)|Arava]]''\n\n==In Assyrian==\nThe term ''m\u00e2tu arb\u00e2i'' describing [[Gindibu]] is found in [[Assyria]]n texts and is translated as ''of Arab land''. Variations of the ethnonym are also found including: ''{{transl|sem|\u02bfArabi&#x202f;}}'', ''{{transl|sem|\u02bfArubu&#x202f;}}'', ''{{transl|sem|\u02bfAribi&#x202f;}}'' and ''{{transl|sem|\u02bfUrbi&#x202f;}}''. The presence of Proto-Arabic names amongst those qualified by the terms arguably justifies the translation \"Arab\" although it is not certain if they all in fact represent the same group. They may plausibly be borrowings from [[Aramaic]] or [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] of words derived from either the proto-Semitic root ''{{transl|sem|\u0121-r-b}}'' or ''{{transl|sem|\u02bf-r-b&#x202f;}}''.\n\nIt is in the case of the Assyrian forms that a possible derivation from ''{{transl|sem|\u0121-r-b}}'' (\"west\") is most plausible, referring to people or land lying west of Assyria in a similar vein to the later Greek use of the term [[Saracen]] meaning in Arabic \"Easterners\", ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u0161arqiyy\u016bn}}'' for people living in the east.\n\n==In Hebrew==\nIn Hebrew the words ''\u02bfarav'' and ''\u02bfaravah'' literally mean \"desert\" or \"steppe\". In the Hebrew Bible the latter feminine form is used exclusively for the [[Arabah]], a region associated with the [[Nabatean]]s, who spoke Arabic. The former masculine form is used in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 21:13 and [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 27:21 for the region of the settlement of [[Qedar|Kedar]] in the [[Syrian Desert]]. 2 [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 9:14 contrasts \u201ckings of ''\u02bfarav&#x202f;''\" with \u201cgovernors of the country\u201d when listing those who brought tribute to King Solomon. The word is typically translated Arabia and is the name for Arabia in Modern Hebrew. The [[New Revised Standard Version]] of the Bible uses instead the literal translation \u201cdesert plain\u201d for the verse in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]]. The adjectival noun ''\u02bfaravi'' formed from ''\u02bfarav'' is used in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 13:20 and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 3:2 for a desert dweller. It is typically translated Arabian or Arab and is the modern Hebrew word for Arab. The New Revised Standard Version uses the translation \"nomad\" for the verse in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]].\n\nIn the Bible, the word ''\u02bfarav'' is closely associated with the word ''\u02bferev'' meaning a \"mix of people\" which has identical spelling in unvowelled text. [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 25:24 parallels \"kings of ''\u02bfarav&#x202f;''\" with \"kings of the ''\u02bferev'' that dwell in the wilderness\". The account in 1 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 10:15 matching 2 [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 9:14 is traditionally vowellized to read \"kings of the ''\u02bferev'' \". The people in question are understood to be the early [[Nabateans]] who do indeed appear to have been a mix of different tribes.  The medieval writer [[Ibn an-Nadim]], in ''Kitab al-Fihrist'', derived the word \"Arab\" from a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] pun by [[Abraham]] on the same root: in his account, Abraham addresses [[Ishmael]] and calls him ''u\u02bfrub'', from Syriac ''\u02bfrob'', \"mingle\".\n\nThe early Nabateans are also referred to as ''\u02bfarvim'' in [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 4:7 and the singular ''\u02bfarvi'' is applied to [[Geshem (Bible)|Geshem]] a leader who opposed Nehemiah. This term is identical to ''\u02bfaravi'' in unvowelled text but traditionally vowelized differently. It is usually translated \"Arabian\" or \"Arab\" and was used in early 20th century Hebrew to mean Arab. However it is unclear if the term related more to ''\u02bfarav'' or to ''\u02bferev''. On the one hand its vowelization resembles that of the term ''\u02bfarvati'' ([[Arbathite]]) which is understood as an adjective formed from ''\u02bfaravah&#x202f;''; thus it is plausibly a similarly formed adjective from ''\u02bfarav'' and thus a variant of ''\u02bfaravi&#x202f;''. On the other hand, it is used in [[Book of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 21:16 for a seemingly different people located in Africa plausibly the same Africans referred to as an ''\u02bferev'' (mix of people) in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 30:5. Any of the other meanings of the root are also possible as the origin of the name.\n\nThe words ''\u02bfaravim'' (plural of ''\u02bfaravi&nbsp;'') and ''\u02bfarvim'' appear the same in unvowelled texts as the word ''\u02bforvim'' meaning [[raven]]s. The occurrences of the word in [[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 17:4-6 are traditionally vowellized to read ''\u02bforvim''. In the [[Talmud]] (''Chullin'' 5a) a debate is recorded as to whether the passage refers to birds or to a people so named, noting a [[Midianite]] chieftain named [[Oreb]] (''\u02bforev'': raven) and the place of his death, the [[Rock of Oreb]]. [[Jerome]] understood the term as the name of a people of a town which he described as being in the confines of the Arabians. ([[Genesis Rabba]] mentions a town named Orbo near [[Beth Shean]].) One meaning of the root \u02bf-r-b in Hebrew is \"exchange/trade\" (''la\u02bfarov'': \"to exchange\", ''ma\u02bfarav&#x202f;'': \"merchandise\") whence ''\u02bforvim'' can also be understood to mean \"exchangers\" or \"merchants\", a usage attested in the construct form in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 27:27 which speaks of ''\u02bforvei ma\u02bfaravekh&#x202f;'': \"exchangers of thy merchandise\". The [[Ferrar Fenton Bible]] translates the term as \"Arabians\" in [[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 17:4-6.\n\n2 [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 26:17 mentions a people called ''\u02bfArviyim'' who lived in [[Gur-baal]]. Their name differs from those mentioned above in the Bible in that it contains an extra letter [[yodh|yod]] but is also translated \"Arabian\". 2 [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 17:11 mentions a people called ''Arvi'im'' who brought [[Jehoshaphat]] tribute of rams and he-goats. Their name is also generally translated as \"Arabians\" although it differs noticeably in spelling from the above-mentioned names as it contains the letter [[aleph]] at the end of the stem. Nothing else is known about these groups.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Edward Lipinski, ''Semitic Languages: Outlines of a Comparative Grammar'', 2nd ed., Orientalia Lovanensia Analecta: Leuven 2001. {{ISBN|90-429-0815-7}}\n*The Catholic Encyclopedia, Robert Appleton Company, 1907, Online Edition, K.

The etymology of the term is closely linked to that of the place name ''[[Arabia]]''.  [[Gustave E. von Grunebaum]], in his book ''Classical Islam'' said that an approximate translation is ''passerby'' or ''[[nomad]]''.<ref>Grunebaum, p. 16</ref>\n\n==Semitic etymology==\nThe root of the word has many meanings in Semitic languages including ''desert'', ''nomad'', ''merchant'', ''raven'' and ''comprehensible'' with all of these having varying degrees of relevance to the emergence of the name. It is also possible that some forms were [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathetical]] from {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0628\u0631}} {{transl|sem|\u02bf-B-R}} \"moving around\", and hence, it is alleged, \"nomadic.\"\n\nThe plurality of meanings results partly from the assimilation of the [[proto-Semitic]] {{lang|ar|\u063a}} ''[[ghayin]]'' with {{lang|ar|\u0639}} {{transl|sem|''[[\u02bfayin]]''}} in some languages. In Hebrew the word {{Hebrew|\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1}} ''{{transl|sem|\u02bfarav}}'' thus has the [[homonym|same]] [[Triliteral|triconsonantal root]] as the root meaning \"west\" ({{Hebrew|\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1}} ''{{transl|sem|ma\u02bfarav}}'') \"setting sun\" or \"evening\" ({{Hebrew|\u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1}} ''{{transl|sem|ma\u02bfariv}}'', {{Hebrew|\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1}} ''{{transl|sem|\u02bferev}}''). The direct Arabic cognate of this is {{lang|ar|\u063a\u0631\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[Al Gharbiyah (disambiguation)|\u0121arb]]}}'' (\"west\", etc.) rather than {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0631\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bfarab}}&#x202f;''; however, in [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Old South Arabian|Sayhadic]],<ref>Sabaic Dictionary (English-French-Arabic) p. 18, A.F.L. Beeston, W.W. Muller, M.A. Ghul, J. Ryckmans</ref> languages which normally preserve [[proto-Semitic]] ''[[ghayin]]'', this root is found with ''[[\u02bfayin]]'' adding to the confusion.<ref>If we assume that the word for \"evening\" was originally pronounced with ''[[\u02bfayin]]'', or that the distinction between ''[[\u02bfayin]]'' and ''[[ghayin]]'' was not phonemic, it could be connected with the \"mixture\" meaning, as evening is when day mixes with night.</ref> The first recorded use of the word is in Hebrew, Genesis 1:5, and its meaning there is \"evening.\"\n\n==In Arabic==\nThe oldest surviving indication of an Arab identity is an inscription made in early Arabic using the Nabatean Aramaic alphabet in 328 CE, which refers to [[Imru' al-Qays ibn 'Amr]] as \"King of all the Arabs\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Recent Research on the Late Antique Countryside|author1=William Bowden |author2=Luke Lavan |author3=Carlos Machado |year=2004|page=91|publisher=Brill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFhsk-ccTsAC&pg=PA91|isbn=9789004136076 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Islamic Societies|author=Ira M.

The two qualities are connected, for example in ayat [[Az-Zukhruf|43]].2-3, \"By the ''clear'' Book: We have made it an ''Arabic'' recitation in order that you may understand\", and the Qur'an came to be regarded as the prime example of {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-\u02bfarabiyyatu}}'', the language of the Arabs. The term ''[[I\u02bfrab|{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bei\u02bfr\u0101b}}]]'' is from the same root, referring to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. Bedouin elders still use this term with the same meaning; those whose speech they comprehend (i.e. Arabic-speakers) they call ''Arab'', and those whose speech is of unknown meaning to them, they call {{lang|ar|\u0639\u062c\u0645}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|\u02bf[[ajam]]}}'' (or {{lang|ar|\u0639\u062c\u0645\u064a}} ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|\u02bfajam\u012b&nbsp;}}''). In the [[Persian Gulf]] region, the term ''Ajam'' is often used to refer to the [[Persian people|Persians]].<ref>An analogy would be the distinction in Slavic languages between ''Slav'' (speaking people, from ''slovo'', word) and ''Niemiec'' (dumb people, used for the Germans).</ref>\n\nThe plural noun ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bea\u02bfr\u0101b}}'' refers to the [[Bedouin]] tribes of the desert who resisted Muhammad, for example in ayat [[At-Tawba|9]].97,\n:{{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0623\u0634\u062f\u0651 \u0643\u0641\u0631\u064b\u0627 \u0648 \u0646\u0641\u0627\u0642\u064b\u0627}}\n:''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-\u02bea\u02bfr\u0101b-u \u02bea\u0161add-u kufr-an wa-nif\u0101q-an}}''<br /> \"the Bedouin are the worst in [[kafir|disbelief]] and [[Nifaq|hypocrisy]]\".\nBased on this, in early Islamic terminology, {{lang|ar|\u0639\u0631\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bfarab}}'' referred to sedentary Arabs, living in cities such as Mecca and Medina, and {{lang|ar|\u0623\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bea\u02bfr\u0101b}}'' referred to the Arab Bedouins, carrying a negative connotation due to the Qur'anic verdict just cited. Following the [[Islamic conquest]] of the 8th century, however, the language of the nomadic Arabs came to be regarded as preserving the highest purity by the grammarians following [[Abi Ishaq]], and the term {{lang|ar|\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kalam al-\u02bfArab}}'' \"language of the Arabs\" came to denote the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins.\n\n:''Cf. the modern toponyms [[Algarve]] and [[Arava (disambiguation)|Arava]]''\n\n==In Assyrian==\nThe term ''m\u00e2tu arb\u00e2i'' describing [[Gindibu]] is found in [[Assyria]]n texts and is translated as ''of Arab land''. Variations of the ethnonym are also found including: ''{{transl|sem|\u02bfArabi&#x202f;}}'', ''{{transl|sem|\u02bfArubu&#x202f;}}'', ''{{transl|sem|\u02bfAribi&#x202f;}}'' and ''{{transl|sem|\u02bfUrbi&#x202f;}}''. The presence of Proto-Arabic names amongst those qualified by the terms arguably justifies the translation \"Arab\" although it is not certain if they all in fact represent the same group. They may plausibly be borrowings from [[Aramaic]] or [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] of words derived from either the proto-Semitic root ''{{transl|sem|\u0121-r-b}}'' or ''{{transl|sem|\u02bf-r-b&#x202f;}}''.\n\nIt is in the case of the Assyrian forms that a possible derivation from ''{{transl|sem|\u0121-r-b}}'' (\"west\") is most plausible, referring to people or land lying west of Assyria in a similar vein to the later Greek use of the term [[Saracen]] meaning in Arabic \"Easterners\", ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u0161arqiyy\u016bn}}'' for people living in the east.\n\n==In Hebrew==\nIn Hebrew the words ''\u02bfarav'' and ''\u02bfaravah'' literally mean \"desert\" or \"steppe\". In the Hebrew Bible the latter feminine form is used exclusively for the [[Arabah]], a region associated with the [[Nabatean]]s, who spoke Arabic. The former masculine form is used in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 21:13 and [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 27:21 for the region of the settlement of [[Qedar|Kedar]] in the [[Syrian Desert]]. 2 [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 9:14 contrasts \u201ckings of ''\u02bfarav&#x202f;''\" with \u201cgovernors of the country\u201d when listing those who brought tribute to King Solomon. The word is typically translated Arabia and is the name for Arabia in Modern Hebrew. The [[New Revised Standard Version]] of the Bible uses instead the literal translation \u201cdesert plain\u201d for the verse in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]]. The adjectival noun ''\u02bfaravi'' formed from ''\u02bfarav'' is used in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 13:20 and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 3:2 for a desert dweller. It is typically translated Arabian or Arab and is the modern Hebrew word for Arab. The New Revised Standard Version uses the translation \"nomad\" for the verse in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]].\n\nIn the Bible, the word ''\u02bfarav'' is closely associated with the word ''\u02bferev'' meaning a \"mix of people\" which has identical spelling in unvowelled text. [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 25:24 parallels \"kings of ''\u02bfarav&#x202f;''\" with \"kings of the ''\u02bferev'' that dwell in the wilderness\". The account in 1 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 10:15 matching 2 [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 9:14 is traditionally vowellized to read \"kings of the ''\u02bferev'' \". The people in question are understood to be the early [[Nabateans]] who do indeed appear to have been a mix of different tribes.

This term is identical to ''\u02bfaravi'' in unvowelled text but traditionally vowelized differently. It is usually translated \"Arabian\" or \"Arab\" and was used in early 20th century Hebrew to mean Arab. However it is unclear if the term related more to ''\u02bfarav'' or to ''\u02bferev''. On the one hand its vowelization resembles that of the term ''\u02bfarvati'' ([[Arbathite]]) which is understood as an adjective formed from ''\u02bfaravah&#x202f;''; thus it is plausibly a similarly formed adjective from ''\u02bfarav'' and thus a variant of ''\u02bfaravi&#x202f;''. On the other hand, it is used in [[Book of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 21:16 for a seemingly different people located in Africa plausibly the same Africans referred to as an ''\u02bferev'' (mix of people) in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 30:5. Any of the other meanings of the root are also possible as the origin of the name.\n\nThe words ''\u02bfaravim'' (plural of ''\u02bfaravi&nbsp;'') and ''\u02bfarvim'' appear the same in unvowelled texts as the word ''\u02bforvim'' meaning [[raven]]s. The occurrences of the word in [[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 17:4-6 are traditionally vowellized to read ''\u02bforvim''. In the [[Talmud]] (''Chullin'' 5a) a debate is recorded as to whether the passage refers to birds or to a people so named, noting a [[Midianite]] chieftain named [[Oreb]] (''\u02bforev'': raven) and the place of his death, the [[Rock of Oreb]]. [[Jerome]] understood the term as the name of a people of a town which he described as being in the confines of the Arabians. ([[Genesis Rabba]] mentions a town named Orbo near [[Beth Shean]].)

Made on a relatively small budget, it is known for having an atypical narrative and directorial style, which combines elements of [[horror film|horror]], [[exploitation film|exploitation film making]] and [[Southern gothic]]. It has subsequently become popular in cult and [[B movie]] circles.<ref name=\"ft1\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n\nLiz Wetherly is a popular black singer in need of a break from her hectic schedule.  When her car breaks down, she ends up stuck in a remote southern town that\u2018s been left for dead \u201cever since they put in the interstate.\u201d<ref name=\"imd1\"/>\n\nShe is forced to spend the night at \u201cBertha\u2019s Oasis\u201d, a rundown lodge that serves as the bizarre fiefdom of an overweight ex-burlesque star who lords over her much younger boyfriend, Eddie, and a cast of equally-strange townsfolk.  Eddie fancies himself a singer on par with [[Elvis]], and expects Wetherly to make him famous.

Today there are around 800 postwar council houses. Some of these have been sold into private ownership.  The area is close by junction 17 of the [[M25 motorway]], which makes up the western  boundary of the village. It lies on the western fringe of [[Rickmansworth]], about {{convert|8|km}} west of [[Watford]] and 6 miles north of [[Uxbridge]].\n\n== Origin of the name ==\nMaple Cross is thought to be a contraction of Maypole Cross and the village was once a place where [[Maypole|maypole dancing]] took place. The nearby village of [[Mill End, Rickmansworth|Mill End]] is on record as having complained to the lord of the manor about the noise of the dancing in 1588.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitoruk.com/Watford/maple-cross-C592-V20636.html|title=Towns and Villages Around Watford {{!}} Maple Cross|quote=Written by members of the Hertfordshire Federation of Women's Institutes.

It sits on the [[A412 road|A412]] Denham Way which itself follows the Old Uxbridge Road along the dry land above the floodplain on the river's west bank. To the west the land rises gently towards the dip slope of the Chiltern Hills, although there are some local steep inclines where dry valleys in the chalk make deep incisions. \nTwo routes to the west join the Uxbridge Road at this point, one to the village of [[Chalfont St Peter]], the other to [[Chalfont St Giles]]. They made it a convenient place to stop and rest and possible gather for May festivals.\n\nUntil the Second World War it was little more than a hamlet with some cottages for agricultural workers and two businesses providing services to travellers on the road, an inn, and a [[farrier]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hertfordshire.gov.uk/media-library/documents/environment-and-planning/landscape/landscape-character-assessments/area001.pdf|title=Maple Cross Slopes, South Hertfordshire Landscape Character Assessment|last=Hertfordshire County Council|pages=13\u201316|access-date=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter WW2 it was intentionally developed as a dormitory for workers in the nearby towns and at the new [[wastewater|sewage]] treatment plant by the river.\n\nThe village has no churches, historically it lacked the population to support one and its residents were part of the parish of St Thomas's [[West Hyde]] a mile to the south. There are two historic buildings,  The Cross Inn which dates back to the seventeenth century and a barn just  to east of the Maple Cross road junction of a  similar age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101100856-barn-to-west-of-maple-lodge-adjoining-maple-close-three-rivers#.WSKMVtQrJkg|title=Barn to West of Maple Lodge Adjoining Maple Close, Three Rivers, Hertfordshire|last=Stuff|first=Good|website=www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-22}}</ref>\n\nThe ancient route known as Old Shire Lane runs in a north south direction at the summit of the rising high ground half a mile to the west. It is at least of Saxon age as it designated the boundary between the kingdoms of [[Wessex]] and [[Mercia]]. Today it forms the boundary between the counties of [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Buckinghamshire]]. Parts of it take the form of a [[Sunken lane|hollow way]] from centuries of use embedding the path into the earth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.colnevalleypark.org.uk/sites/default/files/6%20Old%20Shire%20Lane%20Circular%20Walk.pdf|title=Old Shire Lane Circular Walk|last=Colne Valley Park|access-date=26 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910133103/http://www.colnevalleypark.org.uk/sites/default/files/6%20Old%20Shire%20Lane%20Circular%20Walk.pdf|archive-date=10 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== The Cross Inn public house ==\nThe public house called The Cross stands on Denham Way, the main road from Rickmansworth to Uxbridge and is a listed building with parts dating back to at least the 1700s. In 2010 the pub was sold by its brewery to property developers who intended to demolish it and build new homes on its site and car park. Strong local opposition prevented demolition and the original historic building still stands, converted into dwellings with a small close on the rest of the pub's site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/8091770.Maple_Cross_to_lose_its_pub/|title=Maple Cross to lose its pub|website=Watford Observer|language=en|access-date=2017-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pubshistory.com/HertsPubs/Rickmansworth/MapleCross.shtml|title=Maple Cross, West Hyde, Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire|website=pubshistory.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-21}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial==\nThe area was agricultural right up to the Second World War and arable and livestock farming  continue today on the surrounding land. The area east of The Cross and close to the river was used for gravel extraction facilitated by the Grand Union canal which made transport of bulk material relatively easy.  The river also gave rise to several mills from the 16th century onwards.\n\nA line of clear water springs at the edge of the Colne flood plain provided an excellent site for the cultivation of watercress which requires ponds fed by  fresh flowing water. [[William Bradbery]], the [[watercress]] pioneer moved his business here in 1820. One road in Maple Cross was named Bradbery, by the [[Three Rivers District Council]] in the 1960s to commemorate him\n\nToday some multi-national businesses have offices in Maple Cross in a designated industrial and business area east of the village, attracted by its easy access to the motorway network. The UK headquarters of construction company [[Skanska]] is based here. The corporate functions of the combined [[Cadbury]] and [[Trebor Bassett]] confectionery business moved to the area in 2000.<ref>''Consuming firms costs Cadbury pounds 110m'' [[Birmingham Post]] 30 November 2000</ref>  Other businesses with offices include [[Nissan]] and [[Renault]].\n\n==Schools==\nMaple Cross has one school, Maple Cross [[Junior Mixed and Infant|JMI]], located on the main thoroughfare, Denham Way. Secondary education is generally provided for in Rickmansworth, Watford or Harefield (London).\n\nA new secondary school , The Reach Free School, is opening just outside the village in 2018.\n\n==Transport==\nMaple Cross is bounded by the [[M25 motorway]] and a spur from junction 17, designated as Maple Cross, runs to the village  and the Denham Way. The areas main thoroughfare, Denham Way, was built in the 1950s as an improvement to The Old Uxbridge Road, and forms part of the [[A412 road|A412]].\n\nThe area is served by the [[Greenline route 724]] which runs from [[Heathrow Airport]] to [[Harlow]], [[Essex]], via [[Watford]] and the local Arriva 520 which begins in Maple Cross and runs to Watford.\nThe bus route R21 runs from [[Mount Vernon Hospital]] via [[Harefield]] and [[Rickmansworth]]. It normally terminates at Maple Cross, but extends its journey to [[Uxbridge]] twice per day via [[Denham, Buckinghamshire|Denham]].\n\nThe [[Grand Junction Canal]], later to be renamed as a part of the [[Grand Union Canal]] was built in 1798 alongside the River Colne and remains in use today.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eUqIucVmZjwC|title=Historical account of the navigable rivers, canals, and railways, of Great Britain|last=Priestley|first=Joseph|publisher=.

The cleaned effluent from this process is discharged into the nearby [[Grand Union Canal]].\n\nSludge settled from the incoming sewage is treated by retention in enclosed heated [[anaerobic digestion]] tanks, a by-product of this process being methane gas which is used for on-site electrical power generation. The main product, digested sludge, is \"caked\" in industrial centrifuges before disposal to land as fertiliser. Sludge from the plant was burnt to generate \"green\" electricity for the [[Millennium Dome]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edie.net/library/A-case-of-long-term-treatment/2031|title=A case of long-term treatment|website=www.edie.net|access-date=2017-05-21}}</ref>\n\nThe sewage plant's became famous when it was used as a storage facility for the toxic waste  [[perfluorooctane sulfonate]] (PFOS) after it was used to extinguish the fire at the [[2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire|Buncefield Oil Terminal]].\n\n==Nature Reserve==\nThere is a 40-acre nature reserve on Thames Water owned land formerly used for gravel extraction, adjacent to the sewage treatment plant.

Today there are around 800 postwar council houses. Some of these have been sold into private ownership.  The area is close by junction 17 of the [[M25 motorway]], which makes up the western  boundary of the village. It lies on the western fringe of [[Rickmansworth]], about {{convert|8|km}} west of [[Watford]] and 6 miles north of [[Uxbridge]].\n\n== Origin of the name ==\nMaple Cross is thought to be a contraction of Maypole Cross and the village was once a place where [[Maypole|maypole dancing]] took place. The nearby village of [[Mill End, Rickmansworth|Mill End]] is on record as having complained to the lord of the manor about the noise of the dancing in 1588.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitoruk.com/Watford/maple-cross-C592-V20636.html|title=Towns and Villages Around Watford {{!}} Maple Cross|quote=Written by members of the Hertfordshire Federation of Women's Institutes. The Hertfordshire Village Book, and published by Countryside Books. |website=www.visitoruk.com|publisher=Countryside books|access-date=2017-05-20}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nThe village stands on the western edge of the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] flood plain with the river a third of a mile to the east. It sits on the [[A412 road|A412]] Denham Way which itself follows the Old Uxbridge Road along the dry land above the floodplain on the river's west bank. To the west the land rises gently towards the dip slope of the Chiltern Hills, although there are some local steep inclines where dry valleys in the chalk make deep incisions. \nTwo routes to the west join the Uxbridge Road at this point, one to the village of [[Chalfont St Peter]], the other to [[Chalfont St Giles]]. They made it a convenient place to stop and rest and possible gather for May festivals.\n\nUntil the Second World War it was little more than a hamlet with some cottages for agricultural workers and two businesses providing services to travellers on the road, an inn, and a [[farrier]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hertfordshire.gov.uk/media-library/documents/environment-and-planning/landscape/landscape-character-assessments/area001.pdf|title=Maple Cross Slopes, South Hertfordshire Landscape Character Assessment|last=Hertfordshire County Council|pages=13\u201316|access-date=21 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter WW2 it was intentionally developed as a dormitory for workers in the nearby towns and at the new [[wastewater|sewage]] treatment plant by the river.\n\nThe village has no churches, historically it lacked the population to support one and its residents were part of the parish of St Thomas's [[West Hyde]] a mile to the south. There are two historic buildings,  The Cross Inn which dates back to the seventeenth century and a barn just  to east of the Maple Cross road junction of a  similar age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101100856-barn-to-west-of-maple-lodge-adjoining-maple-close-three-rivers#.WSKMVtQrJkg|title=Barn to West of Maple Lodge Adjoining Maple Close, Three Rivers, Hertfordshire|last=Stuff|first=Good|website=www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-22}}</ref>\n\nThe ancient route known as Old Shire Lane runs in a north south direction at the summit of the rising high ground half a mile to the west. It is at least of Saxon age as it designated the boundary between the kingdoms of [[Wessex]] and [[Mercia]]. Today it forms the boundary between the counties of [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Buckinghamshire]]. Parts of it take the form of a [[Sunken lane|hollow way]] from centuries of use embedding the path into the earth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.colnevalleypark.org.uk/sites/default/files/6%20Old%20Shire%20Lane%20Circular%20Walk.pdf|title=Old Shire Lane Circular Walk|last=Colne Valley Park|access-date=26 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910133103/http://www.colnevalleypark.org.uk/sites/default/files/6%20Old%20Shire%20Lane%20Circular%20Walk.pdf|archive-date=10 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== The Cross Inn public house ==\nThe public house called The Cross stands on Denham Way, the main road from Rickmansworth to Uxbridge and is a listed building with parts dating back to at least the 1700s. In 2010 the pub was sold by its brewery to property developers who intended to demolish it and build new homes on its site and car park. Strong local opposition prevented demolition and the original historic building still stands, converted into dwellings with a small close on the rest of the pub's site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/8091770.Maple_Cross_to_lose_its_pub/|title=Maple Cross to lose its pub|website=Watford Observer|language=en|access-date=2017-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pubshistory.com/HertsPubs/Rickmansworth/MapleCross.shtml|title=Maple Cross, West Hyde, Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire|website=pubshistory.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-21}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial==\nThe area was agricultural right up to the Second World War and arable and livestock farming  continue today on the surrounding land. The area east of The Cross and close to the river was used for gravel extraction facilitated by the Grand Union canal which made transport of bulk material relatively easy.  The river also gave rise to several mills from the 16th century onwards.\n\nA line of clear water springs at the edge of the Colne flood plain provided an excellent site for the cultivation of watercress which requires ponds fed by  fresh flowing water. [[William Bradbery]], the [[watercress]] pioneer moved his business here in 1820. One road in Maple Cross was named Bradbery, by the [[Three Rivers District Council]] in the 1960s to commemorate him\n\nToday some multi-national businesses have offices in Maple Cross in a designated industrial and business area east of the village, attracted by its easy access to the motorway network. The UK headquarters of construction company [[Skanska]] is based here. The corporate functions of the combined [[Cadbury]] and [[Trebor Bassett]] confectionery business moved to the area in 2000.<ref>''Consuming firms costs Cadbury pounds 110m'' [[Birmingham Post]] 30 November 2000</ref>  Other businesses with offices include [[Nissan]] and [[Renault]].\n\n==Schools==\nMaple Cross has one school, Maple Cross [[Junior Mixed and Infant|JMI]], located on the main thoroughfare, Denham Way. Secondary education is generally provided for in Rickmansworth, Watford or Harefield (London).\n\nA new secondary school , The Reach Free School, is opening just outside the village in 2018.\n\n==Transport==\nMaple Cross is bounded by the [[M25 motorway]] and a spur from junction 17, designated as Maple Cross, runs to the village  and the Denham Way. The areas main thoroughfare, Denham Way, was built in the 1950s as an improvement to The Old Uxbridge Road, and forms part of the [[A412 road|A412]].\n\nThe area is served by the [[Greenline route 724]] which runs from [[Heathrow Airport]] to [[Harlow]], [[Essex]], via [[Watford]] and the local Arriva 520 which begins in Maple Cross and runs to Watford.\nThe bus route R21 runs from [[Mount Vernon Hospital]] via [[Harefield]] and [[Rickmansworth]]. It normally terminates at Maple Cross, but extends its journey to [[Uxbridge]] twice per day via [[Denham, Buckinghamshire|Denham]].\n\nThe [[Grand Junction Canal]], later to be renamed as a part of the [[Grand Union Canal]] was built in 1798 alongside the River Colne and remains in use today.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eUqIucVmZjwC|title=Historical account of the navigable rivers, canals, and railways, of Great Britain|last=Priestley|first=Joseph|publisher=.

The cleaned effluent from this process is discharged into the nearby [[Grand Union Canal]].\n\nSludge settled from the incoming sewage is treated by retention in enclosed heated [[anaerobic digestion]] tanks, a by-product of this process being methane gas which is used for on-site electrical power generation. The main product, digested sludge, is \"caked\" in industrial centrifuges before disposal to land as fertiliser. Sludge from the plant was burnt to generate \"green\" electricity for the [[Millennium Dome]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edie.net/library/A-case-of-long-term-treatment/2031|title=A case of long-term treatment|website=www.edie.net|access-date=2017-05-21}}</ref>\n\nThe sewage plant's became famous when it was used as a storage facility for the toxic waste  [[perfluorooctane sulfonate]] (PFOS) after it was used to extinguish the fire at the [[2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire|Buncefield Oil Terminal]].\n\n==Nature Reserve==\nThere is a 40-acre nature reserve on Thames Water owned land formerly used for gravel extraction, adjacent to the sewage treatment plant. It includes lakes and wetlands that provide a habitat for [[wildfowl]] and nine [[Bird hide]]s. The reserve is leased to the Maple Lodge Conservation Society that was founded in 1983.

Such pathological behaviors often prompt new investigation and research, which leads to new theory and more general results. For example, some important historical examples of this are the following:\n\n*The discovery of [[irrational number]]s by the school of [[Pythagoras]] in ancient Greece; for example, the length of the diagonal of a [[unit square]], that is <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>.\n*The discovery of [[complex number]]s in the 16th century in order to find the roots of [[Cubic function|cubic]] and [[Quartic function|quartic]] [[polynomial function]]s. \n*The [[cardinality]] of the [[rational number]]s is equal to the cardinality of the [[integer]]s.\n*Some [[number field]]s have [[ring of integers|rings of integers]] that do not form a [[unique factorization domain]], for example the field <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})</math>.\n*The discovery of [[fractal]]s and other \"rough\" geometric objects (see [[Hausdorff dimension]]).\n*[[Weierstrass function]], a [[real number|real]]-valued function on the [[real line]], that is [[continuous function|continuous]] everywhere but [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] nowhere.<ref name=\":1\" />\n*[[Test functions]] in real analysis and distribution theory, which are [[infinitely differentiable function]]s on the real line that are 0 everywhere outside of a given limited [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]].

These examples prompt their observers to correct their beliefs or intuitions, and in some cases necessitate a reassessment of foundational definitions and concepts. Over the course of history, they have led to more correct, more precise, and more powerful mathematics. For example, the Dirichlet function is Lebesgue integrable, and convolution with test functions is used to approximate any locally integrable function by smooth functions.<ref group=\"Note\">The approximations converge [[almost everywhere]] and in the [[space of locally integrable functions]].</ref>\n\nWhether a behavior is pathological is by definition subject to personal intuition. Pathologies depend on context, training, and experience, and what is pathological to one researcher may very well be standard behavior to another.\n\nPathological examples can show the importance of the assumptions in a theorem. For example, in [[statistics]], the [[Cauchy distribution]] does not satisfy the [[central limit theorem]], even though its symmetric [[bell-shape]] appears similar to many distributions which do; it fails the requirement to have a mean and standard deviation which exist and that are finite.\n\nSome of the best-known [[paradox]]es, such as [[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]] and [[Hausdorff paradox]], are based on the existence of [[non-measurable set]]s. Mathematicians, unless they take the minority position of denying the [[axiom of choice]], are in general resigned to living with such sets.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Computer science==\nIn [[computer science]], ''pathological'' has a slightly different sense with regard to the study of [[algorithm]]s. Here, an input (or set of inputs) is said to be ''pathological'' if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm, such as a violation of its average case [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]], or even its correctness. For example, [[hash table]]s generally have pathological inputs: sets of keys that [[Hash collision|collide]] on hash values. [[Quicksort]] normally has [[Big O notation|O]](n log n) time complexity, but deteriorates to O(n<sup>2</sup>) when it is given input that triggers suboptimal behavior.\n\nThe term is often used pejoratively, as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice (compare with ''[[Byzantine failure|Byzantine]]''). On the other hand, awareness of pathological inputs is important, as they can be exploited to mount a [[denial-of-service attack]] on a computer system. Also, the term in this sense is a matter of subjective judgment as with its other senses. Given enough run time, a sufficiently large and diverse user community (or other factors), an input which may be dismissed as pathological could in fact occur (as seen in the [[Ariane 5 Flight 501|first test flight]] of the [[Ariane 5]]).\n\n== Exceptions ==\n{{main|Exceptional object}}\nA similar but distinct phenomenon is that of [[exceptional object]]s (and [[exceptional isomorphism]]s), which occurs when there are a \"small\" number of exceptions to a general pattern (such as a finite set of exceptions to an otherwise infinite rule). By contrast, in cases of pathology, often most or almost all instances of a phenomenon are pathological (e.g., almost all real numbers are irrational).\n\nSubjectively, exceptional objects (such as the [[icosahedron]] or [[sporadic simple group]]s) are generally considered \"beautiful\", unexpected examples of a theory, while pathological phenomena are often considered \"ugly\", as the name implies. Accordingly, theories are usually expanded to include exceptional objects. For example, the [[exceptional Lie algebra]]s are included in the theory of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s: the axioms are seen as good, the exceptional objects as unexpected but valid. \n\nBy contrast, pathological examples are instead taken to point out a shortcoming in the axioms, requiring stronger axioms to rule them out. For example, requiring tameness of an embedding of a sphere in the [[Sch\u00f6nflies problem]]. In general, one may study the more general theory, including the pathologies, which may provide its own simplifications (the real numbers have properties very different from the rationals, and likewise continuous maps have very different properties from smooth ones), but also the narrower theory, from which the original examples were drawn.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of mathematical jargon]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"Note\" />\n\n==External links ==\n*[http://www.mountainman.com.au/fractal_00.htm Pathological Structures & Fractals] \u2013 Extract of an article by [[Freeman Dyson]], \"Characterising Irregularity\", Science, May 1978\n\n{{PlanetMath attribution|id=6310|title=pathological}}\n\n[[Category:Mathematical terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Mathematical phenomena whose properties are counterintuitive}}\n{{redirect-distinguish|Well behaved|good behaviour (disambiguation){{!}}good behaviour}}\n\n{{refimprove|date=May 2013}}\n\n[[File:WeierstrassFunction.svg|right|thumb|300px|The [[Weierstrass function]] is [[continuous function|continuous]] everywhere but [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] nowhere.]]\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''pathological''' object  is one which possesses deviant, irregular or [[counterintuitive]] property, in such a way that distinguishes it from what is conceived as a typical object in the same category.

Here, an input (or set of inputs) is said to be ''pathological'' if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm, such as a violation of its average case [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]], or even its correctness. For example, [[hash table]]s generally have pathological inputs: sets of keys that [[Hash collision|collide]] on hash values. [[Quicksort]] normally has [[Big O notation|O]](n log n) time complexity, but deteriorates to O(n<sup>2</sup>) when it is given input that triggers suboptimal behavior.\n\nThe term is often used pejoratively, as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice (compare with ''[[Byzantine failure|Byzantine]]''). On the other hand, awareness of pathological inputs is important, as they can be exploited to mount a [[denial-of-service attack]] on a computer system. Also, the term in this sense is a matter of subjective judgment as with its other senses. Given enough run time, a sufficiently large and diverse user community (or other factors), an input which may be dismissed as pathological could in fact occur (as seen in the [[Ariane 5 Flight 501|first test flight]] of the [[Ariane 5]]).\n\n== Exceptions ==\n{{main|Exceptional object}}\nA similar but distinct phenomenon is that of [[exceptional object]]s (and [[exceptional isomorphism]]s), which occurs when there are a \"small\" number of exceptions to a general pattern (such as a finite set of exceptions to an otherwise infinite rule). By contrast, in cases of pathology, often most or almost all instances of a phenomenon are pathological (e.g., almost all real numbers are irrational).\n\nSubjectively, exceptional objects (such as the [[icosahedron]] or [[sporadic simple group]]s) are generally considered \"beautiful\", unexpected examples of a theory, while pathological phenomena are often considered \"ugly\", as the name implies. Accordingly, theories are usually expanded to include exceptional objects. For example, the [[exceptional Lie algebra]]s are included in the theory of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s: the axioms are seen as good, the exceptional objects as unexpected but valid. \n\nBy contrast, pathological examples are instead taken to point out a shortcoming in the axioms, requiring stronger axioms to rule them out. For example, requiring tameness of an embedding of a sphere in the [[Sch\u00f6nflies problem]]. In general, one may study the more general theory, including the pathologies, which may provide its own simplifications (the real numbers have properties very different from the rationals, and likewise continuous maps have very different properties from smooth ones), but also the narrower theory, from which the original examples were drawn.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of mathematical jargon]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"Note\" />\n\n==External links ==\n*[http://www.mountainman.com.au/fractal_00.htm Pathological Structures & Fractals] \u2013 Extract of an article by [[Freeman Dyson]], \"Characterising Irregularity\", Science, May 1978\n\n{{PlanetMath attribution|id=6310|title=pathological}}\n\n[[Category:Mathematical terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Joel Brennan", "label": "safe", "comment": "added wikilinks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_(mathematics)"}
