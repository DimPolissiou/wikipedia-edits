{"title_page": "Shaggy defense", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Rkellytrappedinthecloset2007.jpg|thumb|upright|The term \"Shaggy defense\" is commonly associated with a legal defense strategy used by singer R. Kelly.]]\n\nA '''Shaggy defense''' is a legal strategy in which the defendant denies that they were the one witnessed or recorded committing an alleged act. The strategy's name is derived from [[reggae]] musician [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]]'s 2000 single \"[[It Wasn't Me]]\", which is based around the concept; it was coined by ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' writer [[Josh Levin]] in 2008 to describe the defense used by singer [[R. Kelly]] while he was on trial for [[child pornography]] charges.\n\n==Origin==\n\"[[It Wasn't Me]]\" by [[reggae]] musician [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]] was released in September 2000 as the first single from his fifth album ''[[Hot Shot (Shaggy album)|Hot Shot]]'', eventually reaching #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and other countries. The [[lyrics]] of the song depict one man asking his friend what to do after his girlfriend catches him having sex with another woman. His friend's advice is to deny everything, despite clear evidence to the contrary, with the phrase \"It wasn't me\". As the narrator describes all the evidence his girlfriend has against him, from a video recording to witnessing the cheating herself, his friend adamantly repeats \"it wasn't me\". Ultimately, the narrator says that the advice \"makes no sense at all\".\n\nOn February 3, 2002, a video surfaced allegedly showing popular [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] musician [[R. Kelly]] statutorily raping, and [[Urolagnia|urinating on]], an [[Age of consent|underage]] girl. The story, which was released by an unknown source, was sent to the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', the newspaper that broke the story on February 8, 2002.<ref name=\"child porn investigation\">{{cite news|last1=DeRogatis|first1=Jim|last2=Pallasch|first2=Abdon M. |title=City Police Investigate R&B Singer R.

As comedian [[Chris Rock]] commented on the case during his 2004 [[stand up comedy|stand up]] special ''[[Never Scared]]'', \"What the fuck is wrong with R. Kelly? He's got a lot of balls, ok? Talkin' about 'it ain't me'. Got a damn [[sex tape]] out, 'it ain't me'.

May 23, 2008. \"[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90755482 Trapped in a Courtroom: The R.

While 15 friends and relatives testified that the girl in question was indeed on the video, neither the alleged victim nor her parents showed up in court to testify for either side.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2008/06/long_live_the_little_man_defense.html|title=Long Live the Little Man Defense!|first=Josh|last=Levin|date=June 13, 2008|via=Slate}}</ref> The prosecution witness Lisa Van Allen was easily impeached as a witness due to her clearly sordid history with R. Kelly, others, and even soliciting a bribe from an investigator in the case. \n\nOne juror told the ''Chicago Tribune'', \"At some point we said there was a lack of evidence.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2008-06-14-0806130452-story.html|title=KELLY ACQUITTED|first=Chicago Tribune KYRA KYLES|last=REDEYE|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>\n\n==Use==\nWhile the term remains most commonly associated with the R. Kelly trial, it has been subsequently used to describe any case where the defendant simply denies guilt in the face of overwhelming evidence. For example, in the 2010 [[Virginia]] court case ''Preston v.

Kelly.]]\n\nA '''Shaggy defense''' is a legal strategy in which the defendant denies that they were the one witnessed or recorded committing an alleged act. The strategy's name is derived from [[reggae]] musician [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]]'s 2000 single \"[[It Wasn't Me]]\", which is based around the concept; it was coined by ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' writer [[Josh Levin]] in 2008 to describe the defense used by singer [[R. Kelly]] while he was on trial for [[child pornography]] charges.\n\n==Origin==\n\"[[It Wasn't Me]]\" by [[reggae]] musician [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]] was released in September 2000 as the first single from his fifth album ''[[Hot Shot (Shaggy album)|Hot Shot]]'', eventually reaching #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and other countries. The [[lyrics]] of the song depict one man asking his friend what to do after his girlfriend catches him having sex with another woman. His friend's advice is to deny everything, despite clear evidence to the contrary, with the phrase \"It wasn't me\". As the narrator describes all the evidence his girlfriend has against him, from a video recording to witnessing the cheating herself, his friend adamantly repeats \"it wasn't me\". Ultimately, the narrator says that the advice \"makes no sense at all\".\n\nOn February 3, 2002, a video surfaced allegedly showing popular [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] musician [[R. Kelly]] statutorily raping, and [[Urolagnia|urinating on]], an [[Age of consent|underage]] girl. The story, which was released by an unknown source, was sent to the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', the newspaper that broke the story on February 8, 2002.<ref name=\"child porn investigation\">{{cite news|last1=DeRogatis|first1=Jim|last2=Pallasch|first2=Abdon M. |title=City Police Investigate R&B Singer R.

While 15 friends and relatives testified that the girl in question was indeed on the video, neither the alleged victim nor her parents showed up in court to testify for either side.\"<ref>[http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2008/06/long_live_the_little_man_defense.html Slate article by Josh Levin of June 13 2008]</ref> The prosecution witness Lisa Van Allen was easily impeached as a witness due to her clearly sordid history with R.

{"title_page": "Economic history of Canada", "text_new": "{{Economy of Canada}}\n[[Canadian history|Canadian historians]] until the 1980s tended to focus on economic history, including labour history.  In part this is because Canada has had far fewer political  or military conflicts than other societies.  This was especially true in the first half of the twentieth century when economic history was overwhelmingly dominant.  Many of the most prominent English Canadian historians from this period were economic historians, such as [[Harold Innis]], [[Donald Creighton]] and [[Arthur R. M. Lower]]. \nScholars of Canadian history were heirs to the traditions that developed in Europe and the United States, but frameworks that worked well elsewhere often failed in Canada.  The heavily [[Marxism|Marxist]] influenced economic history that dominates Europe has little relevance to most of Canadian history.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  A focus on [[Social class|class]], [[urban area|urban]] areas, and [[industry]] fails to address Canada's rural and resource-based economy. Similarly, the [[monetarist]] school that is dominant in the United States also has been difficult to transfer north of the border.\n\nThe study of economic history in Canada became highly focused on [[economic geography]], and for many years the dominant school of thought has been the [[staples thesis]].  This school of thought bases the study of the Canadian economy on the study of [[natural resource]]s.  This approach has since also become used outside of Canada, such as Australia and many developing nations.\n\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the [[First Nations]] of what would become Canada had a large and vibrant trade network.  Furs, tools, decorative items, and other goods were often transported thousands of kilometres, mostly by canoe throughout the many rivers and lakes of the region.\n\nThe early European history of the Canadian economy is usually studied through the [[staples thesis]] which argues the Canadian economy developed through the exploitation of a series of staples that would be exported to Europe. Studies show that Canada's economy is growing very well.\n\n==Atlantic fisheries==\n\nThe earliest European settlements in Canada were the [[fisheries]] of the East Coast, especially the [[Grand Banks]] off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].  Boats from France, Portugal, Spain, and Great Britain would traverse the [[Atlantic (ocean)|Atlantic]], fish for a summer and then return laden with fish.  The trade was originally dominated by fishers from southern Europe.  In [[Catholic]] countries, demand for fish was much greater.  It was from the northern nations of Britain and France that the first settlers came, however.   Spain, Portugal and the south of France had abundant supplies of salt because in the warm climates it was a simple matter to evaporate [[seawater]]. They would thus bring barrels of salt with them to the fishing grounds, salt the fish aboard ship, and return to Europe never having touched land. In the colder and wetter climate of the British Isles and northern France, salt was in scarce supply.  To preserve the fish, they were dried by hanging them on large fish racks on the coast of Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]].  These drying stations were active for months of the year, and eventually permanent settlements grew up around them.  These small settlements totalled only a few thousand people, but they were many of the first European arrivals in North America<ref>Joseph Gough, ''Managing Canada's Fisheries: From Early Days to the Year 2000'' (2007)</ref>\n\n==Pacific fisheries==\n\nPrior to European contact, First Nations people on the Pacific Coast would frequently trade salmon with [[Plains Indians|First Nations people of the Canadian Prairies]].<ref>N.D. Jarvis, \"Curing and Canning of Fishery Products: A History,\" ''Marine Fisheries Review'' 50.4 (September 1998): 180-185.</ref> Shortly after European settlements had begun appearing in [[British Columbia]] in the mid 19th century, the first salmon canneries had begun appearing alongside them, the first being a salmon cannery in the [[Fraser River|Fraser river]] in 1867. The next forty years saw the salmon industry gradually become an increasingly lucrative trade in the pacific. Places such as the Fraser river and the [[Skeena River|Skeena river]] saw a sharp rise in immigration and the development of the fishing industry. With the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] came an increased demand for fishing industries of British Columbia to help relieve the war effort.<ref>Pacific Fisherman 1943 Yearbook (Seattle: Consolidated Pub. Co., 1943)</ref> The ten year average for total cases of canned salmon in British Columbia from 1910 to 1942 was 1.6 million, while the Second World War's average alone was more than 2 million, with a peak of 2.25 million in 1942.<ref>Pacific Fisherman 1943 Yearbook (Seattle: Consolidated Pub. Co., 1943): 75.</ref>\n\n==Mercantilism and corporatism==\n{{main|Mercantilism}}\nCanada's economic development in colonial times was based on the economic policy of  [[mercantilism]]. This economic idea sought to derive the maximum material benefit from the colony, for the homeland, with a minimum of imperial investment in the colony itself. The ideology was embodied in [[New France]] through the establishment under Royal Charter of a number of corporate trading monopolies including La Compagnie des Marchands, which operated from 1613 to 1621 and the Compagnie de Montmorency, from that date until 1627. It was in turn replaced by La [[Compagnie des Cent-Associ\u00e9s]] created in 1627, by the King of France, [[Louis XIII]] and the Communaut\u00e9 des habitants in 1643. These were the first corporations to operate in what is now Canada.\n\n==Staples thesis==\n{{main|Staples thesis}}\n[[Harold Innis]] (1894\u20131952), based in the history department at the University of Toronto, and [[William Archibald Mackintosh]] (1895\u20131970), based in the economics department at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] developed the [[Staples thesis]]. They argued that the Canadian Economy (beyond the level of subsistence farming) was primarily based on exports of a series of staples\u2014fish, fur, timber, wheat\u2014that shipped to Britain and the British Empire. Industrialization came much later. The thesis explains Canadian economic development as a lateral, east\u2013west conception of trade. Innis argued that Canada developed as it did because of the nature of its staple [[Commodity|commodities]]: raw materials, such as fish, fur, lumber, agricultural products and minerals. This trading link cemented Canada's cultural links to Britain. The search for and exploitation of these staples led to the creation of institutions that defined the political culture of the nation and its regions.  Innis, Influenced by the American historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] added a sociological dimension:  different staples led to the emergence of regional economies (and societies) within Canada. For instance, the staple commodity in [[Atlantic Canada]] was [[cod|cod fishing]]. This industry was very decentralized, but also very co-operative. In western Canada the central staple was [[wheat]]. Wheat farming was a very independent venture, which led to a history of distrust of government and corporations in that part of the country. (Also important, however, were the shocks caused by volatility in the market for wheat and by the weather itself on the growing season.) In [[Central Canada]], the main staple was fur, and the [[fur trade]] dominated the economy for many years. This fur trade was controlled by large firms, such as the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and thus produced the much more centralized, business-oriented society that today characterizes Montreal and Toronto.<ref>Trevor J. Barnes, \"Industrial geography, institutional economics and Innis.\" in Trevor Barnes, Meric S Gertler  eds., ''The new industrial geography: Regions, regulation and institutions'' (1999): 1\u201322.</ref>\n\n===Core-periphery model===\n\nInnis depicted the relationship between regions of Canada as one of \"heartland\" to \"hinterland\": [[Core-periphery|The periphery]], or hinterland, is dominated by the core, or heartland. Because the heartland was dependent upon the search for and accumulation of staples (which were located in the hinterland) to perpetuate the economy, it sought to gain economic and political power by exploiting the hinterland.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/innis-mcluhan/030003-1020-e.html \"Staples Theory\"] in ''Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan'', from [[Library and Archives Canada]]</ref>  Historians continue to use elements of the Innis model, applying it for example to British Columbia. That province's economic structure exemplifies the \"core-periphery\" structure of intra-regional relationships. The core is metropolitan Vancouver, with its concentration of corporate management and transportation functions and manufacturing growth. It dominates an underdeveloped periphery that depends on production and export of staple commodities.<ref>Thomas A. Hutton, \"The Innisian core-periphery revisited: Vancouver's changing relationships with British Columbia's staple economy.\" ''BC Studies: The British Columbian Quarterly'' 113 (1997): 69\u2013100. [http://new-hfjc.library.ubc.ca/index.php/bcstudies/article/download/1690/1737 online]</ref>\n\n==Fur trade==\n{{Main|North American fur trade}}\n[[Image:coureur de bois.jpg|right|thumb|\"Coureur de bois\" \u2013 A woodcut by [[Arthur Heming]]]]\nThe [[fur trade]] was key to the development of the Canadian interior. In Europe, hats from [[beaver]] pelts had become especially fashionable and valuable, and the forests of North America were home to many of the creatures.\n\nThis trade closely involved the Native peoples who would hunt the beavers and other animals and then sell their pelts to Europeans in exchange for guns, [[textiles]], and luxury items like mirrors and [[bead]]s.  Those who traded with the Native were the ''[[Coureur des bois#Voyageurs|voyageur]]s'', woodsmen who travelled the length of North America to bring pelts to the ports of [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]].<ref>Carolyn Podruchny, ''Making the Voyageur World: Travelers and Traders in the North American Fur Trade'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe French dominated the trade through the [[New France]], the [[Ohio Valley]], and west into what would be [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]].  In an attempt to break the French monopoly the English began trading through [[Hudson Bay]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] built an elaborate network of trading posts and forts.\n\nThere was fierce rivalry between the French and English and their respective Native allies.  Even when the two nations were at peace fierce fighting would occur in the interior.\n\nThe great disadvantage of the fur trade for the Canadas was that it did not encourage settlement.  The fur trade only needed a few highly skilled workers.  Also, the fur trade required more tonnage of goods to be shipped to North America than going the other way.  This meant that there was no excess space on the westward voyage and passage costs were high.  Unlike the United States where agriculture had become the primary industry, requiring a large labour force the population of what would be Canada remained very low.\n\nThis was a great benefit to the British in their struggles with the French.  Over the course of the eighteenth century, the French possessions were gradually seized by the British until, in 1759, all of [[New France]] was conquered.  The continued dependence on trade with Europe, also meant that the northern colonies were far more reluctant to join the [[American Revolution]], and Canada thus remained loyal to the British crown.{{Dubious|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Population history==\n{{main|Population of Canada by year}}\nThe population has grown steadily from a few thousand in the 1660s, to one million in the 1820s, 10 million in the 1920s, and 30 million in 2001.

Timber for the domestic market had long been a small industry in the colonies, but it was changes in Europe in the early nineteenth century that created a large export market.  Great Britain had exhausted its supplies of quality timber by the start of the eighteenth century.  The great [[oak]]s that had built the [[Royal Navy]] were all but gone.  The lack of very large trees that could supply great masts was especially problematic as they were a necessity for both its war and merchant shipping.   A thriving timber importing business had thus developed between Britain and the [[Baltic region]].  This trade was very unpopular for both economic and strategic reasons.<ref>Tim Ball, \"Timber!\", ''Beaver'', April 987, Vol. 67#2 pp 45\u201356</ref>\n\nFor much of the eighteenth century, Britain had encouraged the timber trade with the [[New England]] colonies. The American stands of timber were primarily located along the small, but easily navigable rivers of New York and [[Massachusetts]]. These were fairly quickly exhausted. Even without the American Revolution new sources would have been needed by the start of the nineteenth century.\n\n[[File:Aboutement de bois equarri Quebec 1872.jpg|left|thumb|Butting square timber, Quebec City, QC, 1872.]]\n\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the Continental blockade cut off, or at least reduced the Baltic trade so the British looked northwards to the colonies that had remained loyal and were still available. The industry became concentrated in three main regions. The first to be exploited was the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]] system.  Trees in the still almost deserted hinterland of [[New Brunswick]] were cut and transported to [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] where they were shipped to England. This area soon could not keep up with demand and the trade moved to the [[St. Lawrence River]] where logs were shipped to [[Quebec City]] before being sent on to Europe.  This area also proved insufficient and the trade expanded westward, most notably to the [[Ottawa River]] system, which, by 1845, provided three quarters of the timber shipped from Quebec City. The timber trade became a massive business.  In one summer, 1200 ships were loaded with timber at Quebec City alone, and it became by far [[British North America]]'s most important commodity.  it was from the money made in timber that the [[Bank of Montreal]] was founded in 1817.<ref>Graeme Wynn, ''Timber Colony: A Historical Geography of Early Nineteenth Century New Brunswick'' (2002)</ref>\n\nThe cutting of the timber was done by small groups of men in isolated camps.  For most of the nineteenth century, the most common product was square timber, which was a log that had been cut into a square block in the forest before being shipped.  The timber was transported from the hinterlands to the major markets by assembling it into a raft and floating it downstream.  Because of the narrower and more turbulent waters that one would encounter on the Ottawa River system, smaller rafts, known as \"cribs,\" were employed.  On the St. Lawrence, however, very large rafts, some up a third of a mile in length would be employed.   The most common type of tree harvested was [[Eastern white pine|white pine]], mostly because it floated well.  [[Oak]], which does not float, was in high demand but was much harder to transport and oak timbers needed to be carefully integrated into the raft if they were to be carried to market.\n\n[[File:Timber on the Ottawa River.jpg|right|thumb|Timber booms on the [[Ottawa River]], Canada, 1872.]]\n\nIn 1842, the British preferential tariffs were lifted; however, the transatlantic trade still remained a profitable one.  Demand in Britain remained high, especially for [[Railroad tie|railway ties]].  Improved ships and new technologies, especially the steam engine, allowed the trade to continue to prosper.  After the middle of the century the trade in timber began to decline, being replaced by trade in cut [[lumber]] and the [[pulp and paper]] industry.\n\nOne of the most important side effects of the timber trade was immigration to [[British North America]].  Timber is a very bulky and not a particularly valuable cargo.  For every ship full of British manufactured goods, dozens would be needed to carry the same value of timber.  There was no cargo coming from the British Isles to Canada that could take up as much room on the return voyage.  Exporting [[salt]] filled a few ships, and some vessels were even filled with [[brick]]s, but many timber ships made the westward voyage filled with ballast. The population of Canada was small and the lack of wealth in the area made it an unattractive market.\n\nThere was, however, one cargo that the ship-owners did not have to worry about finding a market for in the sparsely populated New World: people.  Many of the timber ships turned to carrying immigrants for the return voyage from the British Isles to fill this unused capacity.  Timber ships would unload their cargo and sell passage to those desiring to emigrate. During the early nineteenth century, with the preferential tariff in full effect, the timber ships were among the oldest and most dilapidated in the British merchant fleet, and travelling as a passenger upon them was extremely unpleasant and dangerous. It was, however, very cheap.  Since timber exports would peak at the same time as conflicts in Europe, such as the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a great mass of refugees sought this cheap passage across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].\n\nIn later decades after the repeal of the tariff and the increase of competition, the quality and safety of the ships improved markedly. Since the travellers would bring along their own food and bedding the trade was an extremely easy one to operate. All that was required was a few advertisements, generally in Irish [[newspapers]], and the installation of bunks along the side of the hold. An average timber ship could thus carry about 200 passengers. Even with only a fraction of the hundreds of timber ships carrying passengers, this created an unprecedented influx of new inhabitants.  By comparison, it has been calculated that the trade between [[New France]] and Europe only included an average sixty-six immigrants per year over the lifetime of that colony.\n\nThe timber trade did not only bring immigrants to British North America, it also played a very important role in keeping them there as well.  While many of those disembarking from the timber ships would head south to the United States, many others would stay in British North America.  In large part, this was because of the employment that could be found in the timber trade.  At the peak of the trade in the 1840s, 15,000 Irish loggers were employed in the [[Gatineau]] region alone.  This when it had been only a few years before that the population of Montreal was only ten thousand. Similar situations could be found in the other centres of the timber trade.\n\n===Historiography===\nHistorian Robert Gillis, has emphasized the strong interest of lumber men in long-term conservation of the natural resources they were harvesting. However he points out that most historians present a much more negative interpretation:\n:The prevailing attitude in Canadian historiography towards the lumber man is a mixture of maudlin romanticism and harsh, vitriolic condemnation.  Along with most other businessmen the lumber operator is pictured as a crass, yet colourful, grasping individualist dedicated to the proposition of ''laissez faire''. This approach, which might be called the 'robber baron' interpretation of the forest industry, was first adopted by A.R.M. Lower in ''The North American Assault on the Canadian Forest'' (1938). Lower stresses the instability and transitory nature of lumbering, condemns its wastefulness, praises the early efforts at conservation and by calling the lumber men 'buccaneers.'<ref>Robert Peter Gillis, \"The Ottawa lumber barons and the conservation movement 1880\u20131914.\" ''Journal of Canadian Studies'' 9#1 (1974): 14\u201330.</ref>\n\n==Upper Canada==\n\nThe timber industry also created large peripheral industries, the most important of these being agriculture. Unlike the fur trade, the timber trade saw large numbers of men in one location for a substantial period of time.  The lumber camps, and the lumber towns needed to be supplied with food and other provisions.  In the early years of the trade, much of the food, mostly barrels of pork, was shipped from the United States.  Mostly coming from around the Cleveland area, shipping costs were high, creating a market for locally produced goods.  As the loggers pushed ever westwards, farmers followed to take advantage of this [[captive market]]. Some of these farms failed after the loggers moved on, but many found new markets and became permanent settlements.  This process formed the basis of many communities in what is now Ontario.<ref>Douglas McCalla, ''Planting the Province: The Economic History of Upper Canada, 1784\u20131870'' (1993)</ref>\n\nTo encourage the settlement of the best land in the region, the government created the Canada Company.  It was given much of the land in Western Ontario and Southwestern Ontario and tasked with selling it off to immigrants.  It was successful in this, but it also became deeply unpopular for its monopolization of the land.  This was an important trigger of the 1837 rebellions.\n\n==Capitalism and finance==\n\n[[Capitalism]], which would become the dominant philosophy for Canadian economic development, evolved from the economic activity of the colonial business elite. One of the most important manifestations of this ideology was the creation of an indigenous financial system. One of Canada's first banks, the [[Canada Banking Company]] was founded in Montreal in 1792. This was followed by others including the [[Bank of Montreal]], in 1817, the [[Bank of New Brunswick]] in 1820 and the [[Bank of Upper Canada]] in 1821. By 1886, 38 banks had been chartered. The pace of this financial activity was marked by the newly formed Government of Canada with the passing of the Bank Act in 1871. Insurance companies, including, [[Sun Life]], 1865, Mutual Life, 1870, [[Confederation Life]], 1871 and London Life, 1874, were also founded during these years. Markets for the exchange of investments came to Canada as well, with the establishment of the [[Montreal Stock Exchange]] in 1832, the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] in 1861 and the [[Winnipeg Commodity Exchange]] in 1904. The repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] by the Parliament of Britain in 1846, terminated colonial trading preferences and marked the symbolic end of mercantilism in Canada while ushering in the new era of capitalism.<ref>R. Thomas. Naylor, '' The History of Canadian Business: 1897\u20131914. Vol. 1, The Banks and Finance Capital'' (1975)</ref>\n\n==Canals==\n[[File:Engraving of Rideau Canal locks.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Rideau Canal]] in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with [[Parliament Hill]] and the old \"Union Station\" visible in the background.]]\nTo aid settlement and the timber trade, the nineteenth century saw a spree of [[canal]] building projects across the region.  Canals could not only bypass rapids and falls, but they could connect previously unlinked parts of the river system.  They also made transport of goods far easier and safer.  Canals were created for the timber trade, the transport of wheat, and also for military reasons.\n\nThe construction of the Rideau Canal was one of the first projects in Upper Canada to employ thousands of laborers. It was under the control of the  British military. The British officers and the contractors they hired both looked at the workers as  instruments of production required to facilitate the most economic completion of the project. Because of the shortage of jobs, labourers had little choice but to endure difficult and often dangerous working and living conditions. The response of workers to these harsh conditions was militant but sporadic. They tended to act against individual property owners and contractors in order to obtain the immediate necessities for survival. More concerted activity was discouraged in large part by the military which posted soldiers along the line of the canal to suppress dissent and ensure a cheap supply of labour.<ref>William N.T. Wylie, \"Poverty, Distress, and Disease: Labour and the Construction of the Rideau Canal, 1826\u201332,\" '' Labour/Le Travail,'' Spring19 83, Vol. 11, pp 7\u201329</ref>\n\nCanals such as the [[Rideau Canal]], the [[Welland Canal]], the [[Trent\u2013Severn Waterway]] were massive engineering projects, and huge expenditures.  The government of [[Upper Canada]] was bankrupted by these projects, and this was an important factor in the merging of [[Upper Canada]] with the still solvent [[Lower Canada]] into one colony in 1840.<ref>John N. Jackson, ''The Welland Canals and Their Communities: Engineering, Industrial, and Urban Transformation'' (1998)</ref>\n\n==Railways==\n[[File:Eastbound over SCB.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] freight eastbound over the Stoney Creek Bridge, [[British Columbia]].]]\nSee [[Grand Trunk Railway of Canada]]\n\nThe national government strongly supported railway construction for political goals. First, it wanted to knit the far-flung provinces together. Second, it wanted to maximize trade within Canada and minimize trade with the United States to avoid becoming an economic satellite. The Grand Trunk Railway of Canada linked Toronto and Montreal in 1853. Lines to Portland in Maine (which was ice-free), Michigan and Chicago, were subsequently opened. By 1870 it was the longest railway in the world.\n\nThe [[Intercolonial Railway]], finished in 1876, linked the Maritimes to Quebec and Ontario, tying them to the new Confederation.<ref>Jay Underwood, ''Built for War: Canada's Intercolonial Railway'' (2005)</ref> Entrepreneurs in Montreal sought direct lines into the U.S. and shunned connections with the Maritimes, with a goal of competing with American railroad lines heading west to the Pacific. [[Joseph Howe]], [[Charles Tupper]], and other Nova Scotia leaders used the rhetoric of a \"civilizing mission\" centered on their British heritage, because Atlantic-centered railway projects promised to make Halifax the eastern terminus of an intercolonial railway system tied to London. [[Leonard Tilley]], New Brunswick's most ardent railway promoter, championed the cause of \"economic progress\", stressing that Atlantic Canadians needed to pursue the most cost-effective transportation connections possible if they wanted to expand their influence beyond local markets. Advocating an intercolonial connection to Canada, and a western extension into larger American markets in Maine and beyond, New Brunswick entrepreneurs promoted ties to the United States first, connections with Halifax second, and routes into central Canada last.  Thus metropolitan rivalries between Montreal, Halifax, and Saint John led Canada to build more railway lines per capita than any other industrializing nation, even though it lacked capital resources, and had too little freight and passenger traffic to allow the systems to turn a profit.<ref>A.A. den Otter, ''The Philosophy of Railways: The Transcontinental Railway Idea in British North America'' (1997)</ref>\n\nSaint John was cut off by the Confederation promise of an Intercolonial Railway.  E B Chandler, of New Brunswick's north shore, saw to it that the rail line went from ice-bound Montreal along the St. Lawrence and down the North Shore of New Brunswick bringing New Brunswick no benefit except at Moncton. From there the distance to Halifax and Saint John were about equal. So even though Saint John was half as far from Montreal as Halifax, the new federal policy helped Halifax outpace Saint John as the winter port for Canada. When the St. Lawrence opened in the 1950s, yet another Federal government policy killed the port of Saint John. Eventually a rail line was built from Saint John through Maine USA to Montreal. However, Montreal businessmen preferred Portland USA even though the Saint John River Valley, with no rail line, was a shorter route from Quebec. So Canadian Prairie wheat was shipped four months of the year through the port of Portland, Maine, USA. Saint John has dwindled from being the fifth-largest city in Canada at Confederation to the fourth largest city in Atlantic Canada now and 32nd largest city in Canada.\n\nDen Otter (1997) challenges popular assumptions that Canada built transcontinental railways because it feared the annexationist schemes of aggressive Americans. Instead Canada overbuilt railroads because it hoped to compete with, even overtake Americans in the race for continental riches. It downplayed the more realistic Maritimes-based London-oriented connections and turned to utopian prospects for the farmlands and minerals of the west.  The result was closer ties between north and south, symbolized by the Grand Trunk's expansion into the American Midwest. These economic links promoted trade, commerce, and the flow of ideas between the two countries, integrating Canada into a North American economy and culture by 1880. About 700,000 Canadians migrated to the U.S. in the late 19th century.<ref>Den Otten, ''The Philosophy of Railways: The Transcontinental Railway Idea in British North America''  (1997); Bill Waiser, ''Saskatchewan: A New History'' (2005) p. 63</ref> The [[Canadian Pacific]], paralleling the American border, opened a vital link to British Canada, and stimulated settlement of the Prairies. The CP was affiliated with [[James J. Hill]]'s American railways, and opened even more connections to the south. The connections were two-way, as thousands of American moved to the Prairies after their own frontier had closed.\n\nTwo additional transcontinental lines were built to the west coast\u2014three in all\u2014but that was far more than the traffic would bear, making the system simply too expensive. One after another, the federal government was forced to take over the lines and cover their deficits. In 1923 the government merged the Grand Trunk, [[Grand Trunk Pacific]], Canadian Northern and National Transcontinental lines into the new [[Canadian National Railways]] system. Since most of the equipment was imported from Britain or the U.S., and most of the products carried were from farms, mines or forests, there was little stimulation to domestic manufacturing. On the other hand, the railways were essential to the growth of the wheat regions in the Prairies, and to the expansion of coal mining, lumbering, and paper making. Improvements to the St. Lawrence waterway system continued apace, and many short lines were built to river ports.<ref>M. L. Bladen, \"Construction of Railways in Canada to the Year 1885\", ''Contributions to Canadian Economics'' Vol. 5 (1932), pp. 43\u201360; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/136530 in JSTOR]; Bladen, \"Construction of Railways in Canada Part II: From 1885 to 1931\", ''Contributions to Canadian Economics'' Vol. 7 (1934), pp. 61\u2013107; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/136554 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Confederation==\n\nThe repeal of the British [[Corn Laws]] and of preferential treatment for the British colonies led many in British North America to realize that the motherland could no longer be counted on economically. In 1854, the Canadian colonies signed [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] with the United States to try to ensure access to the American market. This treaty was cancelled in 1866, however, leaving the colonies once again adrift.\n\nThe railways were also an important factor. The [[Province of Canada]] had again nearly bankrupted itself by promising unwise subsidies to railway companies. The Maritime colonies wanted a railroad, but as disunited as they were, building one would be all but impossible.\n\nBoth the Maritime colonies and the Province of Canada desired access to the large and unexploited western hinterland. They hoped that if these areas were developed they would become a market for their manufactured goods, and provide exports for the eastern ports.\n\nFor these reasons and others, the colonies of [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and the two Canadas agreed to merge into one [[Dominion]] in 1867. While in name it was a [[confederation]], the new constitution, the [[British North America Act, 1867|British North America Act]] outlined a strongly centralized federation. The federal government had control of most of the taxation power, and was responsible for the largest expenditures, railroads, canals and the military. The provinces were given exclusive jurisdiction over what at the time seemed merely local or minor matters such as health care and education. The pledge to build the [[Intercolonial Railway of Canada]] linking the Maritimes to Quebec and Ontario was finally realized in the 1870s.\n\nIn 1871, British Columbia, which was nearing bankruptcy due to railway construction agreed to join the union in exchange for a [[Canadian Pacific Railway|transcontinental railroad]]. [[Prince Edward Island]] joined in 1873 when the national government provided $800,000 for buying out the landlords who held large blocks of island land. All private holdings over 1,000 acres were sold to the province.<ref>Rusty Bittermann and Margaret McCallum, \"Upholding the Land Legislation of a 'Communistic and Socialist Assembly': The Benefits of Confederation for Prince Edward Island,\" ''Canadian Historical Review,'' (March 2006) 87#1 pp 1\u201328</ref>\n\n{{See also|Canadian Confederation}}\n\n==The National Policy==\n{{Main|National Policy}}\nThe first [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] of the new nation was [[John A. Macdonald]], and he outlined what would be Canada's economic program for decades.  This would be the [[National Policy]] a system of protective tariffs that would encourage the development of Canadian manufacturing.  This would be combined with great railway building projects such as the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] to link the east with the west and the [[Intercolonial Railway]] to link central Canada with Atlantic Canada.<ref>Vernon C. Fowke,  \"National Policy and Western Development in North America\" ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 16, No. 4 (Dec., 1956), pp. 461\u2013479 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2114691 in JSTOR]</ref> Other plans for the National Policy were the promotion of Canadian Identity and the population of western Canada.\n\nCanada had traditionally been committed to free trade and had only had one experiment with a protective tariff with the [[Cayley-Galt Tariff]] of 1858. This policy has long been controversial as it is seen to have favoured [[Central Canada]] at the expense of the [[Canadian Maritimes|Maritimes]] and the [[Canadian West|West]].\n\n==Post-Confederation slump==\n\nIn the years after Confederation, the once-buoyant BNA economy soured, an event some blamed on union or government railway policy, but was more likely caused by the [[Long Depression]] that was affecting the entire world.  Demand for Canadian resources slumped, and protectionist policies in the United States and Europe hurt Canada's trade.<ref>P. B.  Waite, ''Canada, 1874\u20131896'' (1971)</ref>\n\nThere was little immigration to Canada during this period.  Despite efforts to settle the west including the [[Dominion Lands Act]] of 1871, few immigrants were willing to settle on Canada's colder and drier prairies when open land was still plentiful in the United States.  In the thirty years after Confederation, Canada experienced a net out flow of migrants, as a large number of Canadians relocated to the United States.\n\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century, the economies of the Canadian Maritimes were the most industrialized, and prosperous in British North America.  The 1850s and 1860s were especially prosperous.  By the start of the twentieth century, however, they were far poorer than the rest of the country, and remain so to this day.  It has been said that the provinces never emerged from the post-Confederation slump.  See [[Maritimes#Economy|Economy of the Maritimes]] for a full discussion of this issue.\n\n==Boom years==\n[[Image:PostcardToCanadaForInvestmentInCanada1907.jpg|thumb|right|Investors from the United Kingdom and the United States helped fuel the country's economic growth (from a postcard sent in 1907).]]\nThe economy of the rest of the country improved dramatically after 1896, and from that year until 1914, Canada had the world's fastest-growing economy.<ref>R. C. Brown and Ramsay Cook, ''Canada, 1896\u20131921 A Nation Transformed'' (1974)</ref>  The west was settled, the population grew quickly, so that by 1900, Prime Minister [[Wilfrid Laurier]] could predict that the twentieth century would be Canada's century as the nineteenth was the United States's.<ref>{{cite web|author=SMC-MCS, gazette@uottawa.ca |url=https://www.uottawa.ca/services/markcom/gazette/000602/000602-art04-e.shtml |title=A prediction that belonged to the 20th century |publisher=Uottawa.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-04-14}}</ref>\nThe cause of this boom is debated.  Whether the settlement of the west was a cause or effect of the boom is one of the most important issues.  Globally the economy was improving with the end of the Long Depression.  The last semi-humid farmland in the United States was exhausted, leaving Canada with the best unexploited farm land in North America.  Technological changes from the steel plow to [[combine harvester]]s played an important role, but perhaps the most important development was the practice of [[dry farming]] that allowed farmers to profitably grow wheat on the semi-arid southern prairies.\n\nThe most noted expansion was in western Canada, but at the same time Central Canada was undergoing a period of significant [[industrialization]].\n\nWhile western and central Canada boomed during the pre-World War I years the economies of the three Maritime provinces grew far more slowly.  There is also much debate over the cause of this, but its consequence was a growing disaffection with Confederation in the east, manifested by the [[Maritime Rights]] movement.\n\n==Farming==\n\n===Ontario===\nIn Ontario farming was generally quite profitable, especially after 1896.  The major changes involved \"mechanization of technology and a shift toward output of high-grade consumer oriented products\", such as milk, eggs and vegetables for the fast-growing urban markets.<ref>D. A. Lawr, \"The Development of Ontario Farming, 1870\u20131914: Patterns of Growth and Change,\" ''Ontario History,'' Sept 1972, Vol. 64 Issue 3, pp 239\u2013251</ref> It took farmers a half century to appreciate the value of high-protein soybean crops.

The tall grain elevator alongside the railway tracks became a crucial element of the Prairie grain trade after 1890. It boosted \"King Wheat\" to regional dominance by integrating the region's economy with the rest of Canada. Used to efficiently load grain into railroad cars, grain elevators came to be clustered in \"lines\" and their ownership tended to concentrate in the hands of increasingly fewer companies, many controlled by Americans. The main commercial entities involved in the trade were the Canadian Pacific Railway and the powerful grain syndicates. Dramatic changes in the grain trade took place in the 1940s, notably the amalgamation of grain elevator companies.<ref>John Everitt, \"The Line Elevator in Alberta\". ''Alberta History'' [Canada] 1992 40(4): 16\u201322; 1993 41(1): 20\u201326.</ref>\n\nNorrie argues that the necessity of using dry farming techniques created special risks and the farmers responded by using summer fallow rather than the risky but more productive use of substitute crops or the planting of wheat every year. Tenants often preferred the safety of sharecropping to the hazards (and higher returns) of cash rental, and showed an interest in [[crop insurance]]. Because farmers were averse to risk, grain production was less than it might have been.<ref>Kenneth Norrie, \"Dry Farming and the Economics of Risk Bearing: The Canadian Prairies, 1870\u20131930\", ''Agricultural History'', Winter 1977, Vol. 51 Issue 1, pp. 134\u2013148</ref>\n\nRecklessness, greed, and overoptimism played a part in the early-20th-century financial crisis on the Canadian wheat frontier. Beginning in 1916, the [[Palliser Triangle]], a semiarid region in Alberta and Saskatchewan, suffered a decade of dry years and crop failures that culminated in financial ruin for many of the region's wheat farmers. Overconfidence on the part of farmers, financiers, the Canadian Pacific, and the Canadian government led to land investments and development in the Palliser on an unprecedented and dangerous scale. A large share of this expansion was funded by mortgage and loan companies in Britain eager to make overseas investments. British money managers were driven by a complex set of global economic forces including a decline in British investment opportunities, excess capital, and massive investment expansion on the Canadian frontier. Reduced grain production in Europe and increased grain production in the Prairie Provinces also encouraged the export of capital from London. The mythical image of the Palliser as an abundant region, coupled with a growing confidence in technology, created a false sense of security and stability. Between 1908 and 1913 British firms lent vast sums to Canadian farmers to plant their wheat crops; only when the drought began in 1916 did it become clear that far too much credit had been extended.<ref>John Feldberg, and Warren M. Elofson, \"Financing The Palliser Triangle, 1908\u20131913\". ''Great Plains Quarterly'' 1998 18(3): 257\u2013268. 0275\u20137664</ref>\n\n==The First World War and the Roaring Twenties==\n\nCanada played an extraordinarily large role in the [[World War I|First World War]] relative to the size of its population.  It sent over hundreds of thousands of troops, and was also the granary and arms producer for the allied side.  This led to a further boom on the prairies as wheat prices skyrocketed.  The rest of the country, even the Maritimes, benefited from an increase in manufacturing.<ref name=\"Robert Bothwell 1987\">Robert Bothwell,  Ian Drummond, and John English, ''Canada 1900\u20131945'' (1987)</ref>\n\nThe immediate post-war years saw a short, but severe, recession as the economy readjusted to the end of wartime production.  By 1921, the Canadian economy was back on its feet and rapidly expanding.  In the 1920s, there was an unprecedented increase in the standard of living as items that had been luxury goods such as radios, automobiles, and electric  lights\u2014not to mention flush toilets\u2014became common place across the nation.  The boom lasted until 1929.\n\n==The Great Depression==\n{{Main|The Great Depression in Canada}}\n[[File:ReliefWorkHighway.jpg|right|thumb|Road construction at Kimberly-Wasa, British Columbia. The federal government established Relief Projects in 1933 during the height of the Great Depression for unemployed married men of British descent]]\nCanada was hard hit by the [[Great Depression]].  When the American economy began to collapse in the late 1920s the close economic links and the central banking system meant that the malaise quickly spread across the border.  The world demand fell for wheat, lumber and mining products; prices fell, profits plunged, and unemployment soared.\n\nIn May 1930, US raised the tariff with the [[Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act]]. Canada retaliated by imposing new tariffs on 16 products that accounted altogether for around 30% of U.S. exports to Canada.<ref>Richard N. Kottman,  \"Herbert Hoover and the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff: Canada, A Case Study\", ''Journal of American History'' (1975), 62#3 pp 609\u2013635, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2936217 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>McDonald, Judith; O'Brien, Anthony Patrick; Callahan, Colleen \"Trade Wars: Canada's Reaction to the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff\", ''Journal of Economic History'' (1997), 57#4 pp 802\u2013826,  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951161 in JSTOR]</ref>  Following Britain's lead, Canada then forged closer economic links with the [[British Empire]] via the [[British Empire Economic Conference]] of 1932.\n\nBy 1933, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance.  Wages fell as did prices; debts did not fall and they became more burdensome.  [[Gross National Expenditure]] had declined 42% from the 1929 levels.  In some areas, the decline was far worse.  In the rural areas of the prairies two thirds of the population were on relief.  Population growth contracted markedly as immigration slowed, and birth rates fell as people postponed marriage and family life until they were more secure.  Crime rates increased, and a new class of unemployed vagrants appeared.<ref>Pierre Berton, ''The Great Depression: 1929\u20131939'' (1990) is a popular acoount</ref>\n\nCanada remained in depression far longer than the United States, not passing 1929 levels until 1939, with the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].  There was no national recovery program similar to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]].\n\n==The Second World War and the boom years==\n\nThe turn around brought about by the command economy imposed at the beginning of the Second World War was immense.  Unemployment virtually disappeared by 1940 as soldiers were recruited and factories turned to war production.  Canada was in the unusual situation of helping Britain financially, through a program similar to the American [[Lend-Lease]].<ref>C. P.  Stacey, ''Arms, Men and Governments: The War Policies of Canada, 1939\u20131945'' (1970)</ref>\n\nIn the twenty-five years after the war, there was an immense expansion in the Canadian economy.  Unemployment remained low and the end of wartime production was quickly turned over to making consumer goods.  Canada, along with many other developed nations, firmly established itself as a [[welfare state]] with publicly funded [[health care]], the [[Canada Pension Plan]], and other programs.<ref>Robert  Bothwell, Ian Drummond, and John English, ''Canada since 1945'' (2d. ed. 1989)</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the Canadian economy became much more closely integrated with the American one as tariff barriers fell and trade agreements like the [[Canada-United States Automotive Agreement]] and the \"Hyde Park Declaration\" were signed.\n\n==Recent years==\n\n===Recession===\nCanada experienced economic [[recession]] in the early 1980s and again in the [[Late 1980s recession|early 1990s]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/recession.html |title=Ecolnomic Concepts: Recession |access-date=20 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325185942/http://www.canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/recession.html |archive-date=25 March 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This led to massive government [[Government budget deficit|deficit]]s, high unemployment, and general disaffection.  The poor economy helped lead to the overwhelming rejection of the\n[[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] in the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 election]], and the fall of other governments such as [[Bob Rae]]'s [[Ontario New Democratic Party]].  The poor economy may have increased support for sovereignty in [[Quebec]], an option that was just barely rejected in the [[1995 Quebec referendum]].\n\nA brief recovery in 1994 was followed by an economic slump in 1995\u20131996. Since that date, the Canadian economy has improved markedly, in step with the boom in the United States. In the mid-1990s, [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]]'s Liberal government began to post annual budgetary surpluses, and steadily paid down the national debt.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Johnson|title=Thinking Government: Public Sector Management in Canada |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcL80sSautgC&pg=PA374|year=2006|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-55111-779-9|page=374}}</ref> Once referred to as a fiscal basket-case {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, Canada has become a model of fiscal stability as the government has posted surpluses every fiscal year from 1996 to the [[Late-2000s recession|2008 recession]].\n\nThe [[Early 2000s recession|recession]] brought on in the United States by the collapse of the [[dot-com bubble]] beginning in 2000, hurt the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] but has affected Canada only mildly.

As most aspects of the healthcare system are financed from general government revenues, and as provincial governments bear the majority of these costs, healthcare has grown to become the largest component of Canadian provincial budgets.  Medicare is also a relevant factor in the decisions of employers to locate businesses in Canada (where government pays most of employees' healthcare costs) as opposed to the United States (where employers more directly pay many healthcare costs).\n\n===Poverty===\n[[Poverty in Canada]] remains a prevalent issue within some segments of society. The most frequently quoted measure, the low-income cut off or LICO, displays a downward trend since 2000 after a spike in the mid-1990s and was 10.8% as of 2005.<ref name=CBCAnalysis>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/economy/poverty-line.html Poverty Measure in Canada Analysis], [[CBC News|CBC]], URL accessed 4 January 2007</ref> Another measure, published by the free market think tank [[Fraser Institute]], displays a constant downward trend since 1970 and stood at 4.9% as of 2004.

Australia's GDP per caput was well above those of Britain and the United States in 1870, and more than twice the Canadian level.

In part this is because Canada has had far fewer political  or military conflicts than other societies.  This was especially true in the first half of the twentieth century when economic history was overwhelmingly dominant.  Many of the most prominent English Canadian historians from this period were economic historians, such as [[Harold Innis]], [[Donald Creighton]] and [[Arthur R. M. Lower]]. \nScholars of Canadian history were heirs to the traditions that developed in Europe and the United States, but frameworks that worked well elsewhere often failed in Canada.  The heavily [[Marxism|Marxist]] influenced economic history that dominates Europe has little relevance to most of Canadian history.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  A focus on [[Social class|class]], [[urban area|urban]] areas, and [[industry]] fails to address Canada's rural and resource-based economy. Similarly, the [[monetarist]] school that is dominant in the United States also has been difficult to transfer north of the border.\n\nThe study of economic history in Canada became highly focused on [[economic geography]], and for many years the dominant school of thought has been the [[staples thesis]].  This school of thought bases the study of the Canadian economy on the study of [[natural resource]]s.  This approach has since also become used outside of Canada, such as Australia and many developing nations.\n\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the [[First Nations]] of what would become Canada had a large and vibrant trade network.  Furs, tools, decorative items, and other goods were often transported thousands of kilometres, mostly by canoe throughout the many rivers and lakes of the region.\n\nThe early European history of the Canadian economy is usually studied through the [[staples thesis]] which argues the Canadian economy developed through the exploitation of a series of staples that would be exported to Europe. Studies show that Canada's economy is growing very well.\n\n==Atlantic fisheries==\n\nThe earliest European settlements in Canada were the [[fisheries]] of the East Coast, especially the [[Grand Banks]] off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].  Boats from France, Portugal, Spain, and Great Britain would traverse the [[Atlantic (ocean)|Atlantic]], fish for a summer and then return laden with fish.  The trade was originally dominated by fishers from southern Europe.  In [[Catholic]] countries, demand for fish was much greater.  It was from the northern nations of Britain and France that the first settlers came, however.   Spain, Portugal and the south of France had abundant supplies of salt because in the warm climates it was a simple matter to evaporate [[seawater]]. They would thus bring barrels of salt with them to the fishing grounds, salt the fish aboard ship, and return to Europe never having touched land. In the colder and wetter climate of the British Isles and northern France, salt was in scarce supply.  To preserve the fish, they were dried by hanging them on large fish racks on the coast of Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]].  These drying stations were active for months of the year, and eventually permanent settlements grew up around them.  These small settlements totalled only a few thousand people, but they were many of the first European arrivals in North America<ref>Joseph Gough, ''Managing Canada's Fisheries: From Early Days to the Year 2000'' (2007)</ref>\n\n==Pacific fisheries==\n\nPrior to European contact, First Nations people on the Pacific Coast would frequently trade salmon with [[Plains Indians|First Nations people of the Canadian Prairies]].<ref>N.D. Jarvis, \"Curing and Canning of Fishery Products: A History,\" ''Marine Fisheries Review'' 50.4 (September 1998): 180-185.</ref> Shortly after European settlements had begun appearing in [[British Columbia]] in the mid 19th century, the first salmon canneries had begun appearing alongside them, the first being a salmon cannery in the [[Fraser River|Fraser river]] in 1867. The next forty years saw the salmon industry gradually become an increasingly lucrative trade in the pacific. Places such as the Fraser river and the [[Skeena River|Skeena river]] saw a sharp rise in immigration and the development of the fishing industry. With the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] came an increased demand for fishing industries of British Columbia to help relieve the war effort.<ref>Pacific Fisherman 1943 Yearbook (Seattle: Consolidated Pub. Co., 1943)</ref> The ten year average for total cases of canned salmon in British Columbia from 1910 to 1942 was 1.6 million, while the Second World War's average alone was more than 2 million, with a peak of 2.25 million in 1942.<ref>Pacific Fisherman 1943 Yearbook (Seattle: Consolidated Pub. Co., 1943): 75.</ref>\n\n==Mercantilism and corporatism==\n{{main|Mercantilism}}\nCanada's economic development in colonial times was based on the economic policy of  [[mercantilism]]. This economic idea sought to derive the maximum material benefit from the colony, for the homeland, with a minimum of imperial investment in the colony itself. The ideology was embodied in [[New France]] through the establishment under Royal Charter of a number of corporate trading monopolies including La Compagnie des Marchands, which operated from 1613 to 1621 and the Compagnie de Montmorency, from that date until 1627. It was in turn replaced by La [[Compagnie des Cent-Associ\u00e9s]] created in 1627, by the King of France, [[Louis XIII]] and the Communaut\u00e9 des habitants in 1643. These were the first corporations to operate in what is now Canada.\n\n==Staples thesis==\n{{main|Staples thesis}}\n[[Harold Innis]] (1894\u20131952), based in the history department at the University of Toronto, and [[William Archibald Mackintosh]] (1895\u20131970), based in the economics department at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] developed the [[Staples thesis]]. They argued that the Canadian Economy (beyond the level of subsistence farming) was primarily based on exports of a series of staples\u2014fish, fur, timber, wheat\u2014that shipped to Britain and the British Empire. Industrialization came much later. The thesis explains Canadian economic development as a lateral, east\u2013west conception of trade. Innis argued that Canada developed as it did because of the nature of its staple [[Commodity|commodities]]: raw materials, such as fish, fur, lumber, agricultural products and minerals. This trading link cemented Canada's cultural links to Britain. The search for and exploitation of these staples led to the creation of institutions that defined the political culture of the nation and its regions.  Innis, Influenced by the American historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] added a sociological dimension:  different staples led to the emergence of regional economies (and societies) within Canada. For instance, the staple commodity in [[Atlantic Canada]] was [[cod|cod fishing]]. This industry was very decentralized, but also very co-operative. In western Canada the central staple was [[wheat]]. Wheat farming was a very independent venture, which led to a history of distrust of government and corporations in that part of the country. (Also important, however, were the shocks caused by volatility in the market for wheat and by the weather itself on the growing season.) In [[Central Canada]], the main staple was fur, and the [[fur trade]] dominated the economy for many years. This fur trade was controlled by large firms, such as the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and thus produced the much more centralized, business-oriented society that today characterizes Montreal and Toronto.<ref>Trevor J. Barnes, \"Industrial geography, institutional economics and Innis.\" in Trevor Barnes, Meric S Gertler  eds., ''The new industrial geography: Regions, regulation and institutions'' (1999): 1\u201322.</ref>\n\n===Core-periphery model===\n\nInnis depicted the relationship between regions of Canada as one of \"heartland\" to \"hinterland\": [[Core-periphery|The periphery]], or hinterland, is dominated by the core, or heartland. Because the heartland was dependent upon the search for and accumulation of staples (which were located in the hinterland) to perpetuate the economy, it sought to gain economic and political power by exploiting the hinterland.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/innis-mcluhan/030003-1020-e.html \"Staples Theory\"] in ''Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan'', from [[Library and Archives Canada]]</ref>  Historians continue to use elements of the Innis model, applying it for example to British Columbia. That province's economic structure exemplifies the \"core-periphery\" structure of intra-regional relationships. The core is metropolitan Vancouver, with its concentration of corporate management and transportation functions and manufacturing growth. It dominates an underdeveloped periphery that depends on production and export of staple commodities.<ref>Thomas A. Hutton, \"The Innisian core-periphery revisited: Vancouver's changing relationships with British Columbia's staple economy.\" ''BC Studies: The British Columbian Quarterly'' 113 (1997): 69\u2013100.

In Europe, hats from [[beaver]] pelts had become especially fashionable and valuable, and the forests of North America were home to many of the creatures.\n\nThis trade closely involved the Native peoples who would hunt the beavers and other animals and then sell their pelts to Europeans in exchange for guns, [[textiles]], and luxury items like mirrors and [[bead]]s.  Those who traded with the Native were the ''[[Coureur des bois#Voyageurs|voyageur]]s'', woodsmen who travelled the length of North America to bring pelts to the ports of [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]].<ref>Carolyn Podruchny, ''Making the Voyageur World: Travelers and Traders in the North American Fur Trade'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe French dominated the trade through the [[New France]], the [[Ohio Valley]], and west into what would be [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]].  In an attempt to break the French monopoly the English began trading through [[Hudson Bay]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] built an elaborate network of trading posts and forts.\n\nThere was fierce rivalry between the French and English and their respective Native allies.  Even when the two nations were at peace fierce fighting would occur in the interior.\n\nThe great disadvantage of the fur trade for the Canadas was that it did not encourage settlement.  The fur trade only needed a few highly skilled workers.  Also, the fur trade required more tonnage of goods to be shipped to North America than going the other way.  This meant that there was no excess space on the westward voyage and passage costs were high.  Unlike the United States where agriculture had become the primary industry, requiring a large labour force the population of what would be Canada remained very low.\n\nThis was a great benefit to the British in their struggles with the French.  Over the course of the eighteenth century, the French possessions were gradually seized by the British until, in 1759, all of [[New France]] was conquered.  The continued dependence on trade with Europe, also meant that the northern colonies were far more reluctant to join the [[American Revolution]], and Canada thus remained loyal to the British crown.{{Dubious|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Population history==\n{{main|Population of Canada by year}}\nThe population has grown steadily from a few thousand in the 1660s, to one million in the 1820s, 10 million in the 1920s, and 30 million in 2001.

Timber for the domestic market had long been a small industry in the colonies, but it was changes in Europe in the early nineteenth century that created a large export market.  Great Britain had exhausted its supplies of quality timber by the start of the eighteenth century.  The great [[oak]]s that had built the [[Royal Navy]] were all but gone.  The lack of very large trees that could supply great masts was especially problematic as they were a necessity for both its war and merchant shipping.   A thriving timber importing business had thus developed between Britain and the [[Baltic region]].  This trade was very unpopular for both economic and strategic reasons.<ref>Tim Ball, \"Timber!\", ''Beaver'', April 987, Vol. 67#2 pp 45\u201356</ref>\n\nFor much of the eighteenth century, Britain had encouraged the timber trade with the [[New England]] colonies. The American stands of timber were primarily located along the small, but easily navigable rivers of New York and [[Massachusetts]]. These were fairly quickly exhausted. Even without the American Revolution new sources would have been needed by the start of the nineteenth century.\n\n[[File:Aboutement de bois equarri Quebec 1872.jpg|left|thumb|Butting square timber, Quebec City, QC, 1872.]]\n\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the Continental blockade cut off, or at least reduced the Baltic trade so the British looked northwards to the colonies that had remained loyal and were still available. The industry became concentrated in three main regions. The first to be exploited was the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]] system.  Trees in the still almost deserted hinterland of [[New Brunswick]] were cut and transported to [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] where they were shipped to England. This area soon could not keep up with demand and the trade moved to the [[St. Lawrence River]] where logs were shipped to [[Quebec City]] before being sent on to Europe.  This area also proved insufficient and the trade expanded westward, most notably to the [[Ottawa River]] system, which, by 1845, provided three quarters of the timber shipped from Quebec City. The timber trade became a massive business.  In one summer, 1200 ships were loaded with timber at Quebec City alone, and it became by far [[British North America]]'s most important commodity.  it was from the money made in timber that the [[Bank of Montreal]] was founded in 1817.<ref>Graeme Wynn, ''Timber Colony: A Historical Geography of Early Nineteenth Century New Brunswick'' (2002)</ref>\n\nThe cutting of the timber was done by small groups of men in isolated camps.  For most of the nineteenth century, the most common product was square timber, which was a log that had been cut into a square block in the forest before being shipped.  The timber was transported from the hinterlands to the major markets by assembling it into a raft and floating it downstream.  Because of the narrower and more turbulent waters that one would encounter on the Ottawa River system, smaller rafts, known as \"cribs,\" were employed.  On the St. Lawrence, however, very large rafts, some up a third of a mile in length would be employed.   The most common type of tree harvested was [[Eastern white pine|white pine]], mostly because it floated well.  [[Oak]], which does not float, was in high demand but was much harder to transport and oak timbers needed to be carefully integrated into the raft if they were to be carried to market.\n\n[[File:Timber on the Ottawa River.jpg|right|thumb|Timber booms on the [[Ottawa River]], Canada, 1872.]]\n\nIn 1842, the British preferential tariffs were lifted; however, the transatlantic trade still remained a profitable one.  Demand in Britain remained high, especially for [[Railroad tie|railway ties]].  Improved ships and new technologies, especially the steam engine, allowed the trade to continue to prosper.  After the middle of the century the trade in timber began to decline, being replaced by trade in cut [[lumber]] and the [[pulp and paper]] industry.\n\nOne of the most important side effects of the timber trade was immigration to [[British North America]].  Timber is a very bulky and not a particularly valuable cargo.  For every ship full of British manufactured goods, dozens would be needed to carry the same value of timber.  There was no cargo coming from the British Isles to Canada that could take up as much room on the return voyage.  Exporting [[salt]] filled a few ships, and some vessels were even filled with [[brick]]s, but many timber ships made the westward voyage filled with ballast. The population of Canada was small and the lack of wealth in the area made it an unattractive market.\n\nThere was, however, one cargo that the ship-owners did not have to worry about finding a market for in the sparsely populated New World: people.  Many of the timber ships turned to carrying immigrants for the return voyage from the British Isles to fill this unused capacity.  Timber ships would unload their cargo and sell passage to those desiring to emigrate. During the early nineteenth century, with the preferential tariff in full effect, the timber ships were among the oldest and most dilapidated in the British merchant fleet, and travelling as a passenger upon them was extremely unpleasant and dangerous. It was, however, very cheap.  Since timber exports would peak at the same time as conflicts in Europe, such as the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a great mass of refugees sought this cheap passage across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].\n\nIn later decades after the repeal of the tariff and the increase of competition, the quality and safety of the ships improved markedly. Since the travellers would bring along their own food and bedding the trade was an extremely easy one to operate. All that was required was a few advertisements, generally in Irish [[newspapers]], and the installation of bunks along the side of the hold. An average timber ship could thus carry about 200 passengers. Even with only a fraction of the hundreds of timber ships carrying passengers, this created an unprecedented influx of new inhabitants.  By comparison, it has been calculated that the trade between [[New France]] and Europe only included an average sixty-six immigrants per year over the lifetime of that colony.\n\nThe timber trade did not only bring immigrants to British North America, it also played a very important role in keeping them there as well.  While many of those disembarking from the timber ships would head south to the United States, many others would stay in British North America.  In large part, this was because of the employment that could be found in the timber trade.  At the peak of the trade in the 1840s, 15,000 Irish loggers were employed in the [[Gatineau]] region alone.  This when it had been only a few years before that the population of Montreal was only ten thousand. Similar situations could be found in the other centres of the timber trade.\n\n===Historiography===\nHistorian Robert Gillis, has emphasized the strong interest of lumber men in long-term conservation of the natural resources they were harvesting. However he points out that most historians present a much more negative interpretation:\n:The prevailing attitude in Canadian historiography towards the lumber man is a mixture of maudlin romanticism and harsh, vitriolic condemnation.  Along with most other businessmen the lumber operator is pictured as a crass, yet colourful, grasping individualist dedicated to the proposition of ''laissez faire''. This approach, which might be called the 'robber baron' interpretation of the forest industry, was first adopted by A.R.M. Lower in ''The North American Assault on the Canadian Forest'' (1938). Lower stresses the instability and transitory nature of lumbering, condemns its wastefulness, praises the early efforts at conservation and by calling the lumber men 'buccaneers.'<ref>Robert Peter Gillis, \"The Ottawa lumber barons and the conservation movement 1880\u20131914.\" ''Journal of Canadian Studies'' 9#1 (1974): 14\u201330.</ref>\n\n==Upper Canada==\n\nThe timber industry also created large peripheral industries, the most important of these being agriculture. Unlike the fur trade, the timber trade saw large numbers of men in one location for a substantial period of time.  The lumber camps, and the lumber towns needed to be supplied with food and other provisions.  In the early years of the trade, much of the food, mostly barrels of pork, was shipped from the United States.  Mostly coming from around the Cleveland area, shipping costs were high, creating a market for locally produced goods.  As the loggers pushed ever westwards, farmers followed to take advantage of this [[captive market]]. Some of these farms failed after the loggers moved on, but many found new markets and became permanent settlements.  This process formed the basis of many communities in what is now Ontario.<ref>Douglas McCalla, ''Planting the Province: The Economic History of Upper Canada, 1784\u20131870'' (1993)</ref>\n\nTo encourage the settlement of the best land in the region, the government created the Canada Company.  It was given much of the land in Western Ontario and Southwestern Ontario and tasked with selling it off to immigrants.  It was successful in this, but it also became deeply unpopular for its monopolization of the land.  This was an important trigger of the 1837 rebellions.\n\n==Capitalism and finance==\n\n[[Capitalism]], which would become the dominant philosophy for Canadian economic development, evolved from the economic activity of the colonial business elite. One of the most important manifestations of this ideology was the creation of an indigenous financial system. One of Canada's first banks, the [[Canada Banking Company]] was founded in Montreal in 1792. This was followed by others including the [[Bank of Montreal]], in 1817, the [[Bank of New Brunswick]] in 1820 and the [[Bank of Upper Canada]] in 1821. By 1886, 38 banks had been chartered. The pace of this financial activity was marked by the newly formed Government of Canada with the passing of the Bank Act in 1871. Insurance companies, including, [[Sun Life]], 1865, Mutual Life, 1870, [[Confederation Life]], 1871 and London Life, 1874, were also founded during these years. Markets for the exchange of investments came to Canada as well, with the establishment of the [[Montreal Stock Exchange]] in 1832, the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] in 1861 and the [[Winnipeg Commodity Exchange]] in 1904. The repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] by the Parliament of Britain in 1846, terminated colonial trading preferences and marked the symbolic end of mercantilism in Canada while ushering in the new era of capitalism.<ref>R. Thomas. Naylor, '' The History of Canadian Business: 1897\u20131914. Vol. 1, The Banks and Finance Capital'' (1975)</ref>\n\n==Canals==\n[[File:Engraving of Rideau Canal locks.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Rideau Canal]] in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with [[Parliament Hill]] and the old \"Union Station\" visible in the background.]]\nTo aid settlement and the timber trade, the nineteenth century saw a spree of [[canal]] building projects across the region.  Canals could not only bypass rapids and falls, but they could connect previously unlinked parts of the river system.  They also made transport of goods far easier and safer.  Canals were created for the timber trade, the transport of wheat, and also for military reasons.\n\nThe construction of the Rideau Canal was one of the first projects in Upper Canada to employ thousands of laborers. It was under the control of the  British military. The British officers and the contractors they hired both looked at the workers as  instruments of production required to facilitate the most economic completion of the project. Because of the shortage of jobs, labourers had little choice but to endure difficult and often dangerous working and living conditions. The response of workers to these harsh conditions was militant but sporadic. They tended to act against individual property owners and contractors in order to obtain the immediate necessities for survival. More concerted activity was discouraged in large part by the military which posted soldiers along the line of the canal to suppress dissent and ensure a cheap supply of labour.<ref>William N.T. Wylie, \"Poverty, Distress, and Disease: Labour and the Construction of the Rideau Canal, 1826\u201332,\" '' Labour/Le Travail,'' Spring19 83, Vol. 11, pp 7\u201329</ref>\n\nCanals such as the [[Rideau Canal]], the [[Welland Canal]], the [[Trent\u2013Severn Waterway]] were massive engineering projects, and huge expenditures.  The government of [[Upper Canada]] was bankrupted by these projects, and this was an important factor in the merging of [[Upper Canada]] with the still solvent [[Lower Canada]] into one colony in 1840.<ref>John N. Jackson, ''The Welland Canals and Their Communities: Engineering, Industrial, and Urban Transformation'' (1998)</ref>\n\n==Railways==\n[[File:Eastbound over SCB.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] freight eastbound over the Stoney Creek Bridge, [[British Columbia]].]]\nSee [[Grand Trunk Railway of Canada]]\n\nThe national government strongly supported railway construction for political goals. First, it wanted to knit the far-flung provinces together. Second, it wanted to maximize trade within Canada and minimize trade with the United States to avoid becoming an economic satellite. The Grand Trunk Railway of Canada linked Toronto and Montreal in 1853. Lines to Portland in Maine (which was ice-free), Michigan and Chicago, were subsequently opened. By 1870 it was the longest railway in the world.\n\nThe [[Intercolonial Railway]], finished in 1876, linked the Maritimes to Quebec and Ontario, tying them to the new Confederation.<ref>Jay Underwood, ''Built for War: Canada's Intercolonial Railway'' (2005)</ref> Entrepreneurs in Montreal sought direct lines into the U.S. and shunned connections with the Maritimes, with a goal of competing with American railroad lines heading west to the Pacific. [[Joseph Howe]], [[Charles Tupper]], and other Nova Scotia leaders used the rhetoric of a \"civilizing mission\" centered on their British heritage, because Atlantic-centered railway projects promised to make Halifax the eastern terminus of an intercolonial railway system tied to London. [[Leonard Tilley]], New Brunswick's most ardent railway promoter, championed the cause of \"economic progress\", stressing that Atlantic Canadians needed to pursue the most cost-effective transportation connections possible if they wanted to expand their influence beyond local markets. Advocating an intercolonial connection to Canada, and a western extension into larger American markets in Maine and beyond, New Brunswick entrepreneurs promoted ties to the United States first, connections with Halifax second, and routes into central Canada last.  Thus metropolitan rivalries between Montreal, Halifax, and Saint John led Canada to build more railway lines per capita than any other industrializing nation, even though it lacked capital resources, and had too little freight and passenger traffic to allow the systems to turn a profit.<ref>A.A. den Otter, ''The Philosophy of Railways: The Transcontinental Railway Idea in British North America'' (1997)</ref>\n\nSaint John was cut off by the Confederation promise of an Intercolonial Railway.  E B Chandler, of New Brunswick's north shore, saw to it that the rail line went from ice-bound Montreal along the St. Lawrence and down the North Shore of New Brunswick bringing New Brunswick no benefit except at Moncton. From there the distance to Halifax and Saint John were about equal. So even though Saint John was half as far from Montreal as Halifax, the new federal policy helped Halifax outpace Saint John as the winter port for Canada. When the St. Lawrence opened in the 1950s, yet another Federal government policy killed the port of Saint John. Eventually a rail line was built from Saint John through Maine USA to Montreal. However, Montreal businessmen preferred Portland USA even though the Saint John River Valley, with no rail line, was a shorter route from Quebec. So Canadian Prairie wheat was shipped four months of the year through the port of Portland, Maine, USA. Saint John has dwindled from being the fifth-largest city in Canada at Confederation to the fourth largest city in Atlantic Canada now and 32nd largest city in Canada.\n\nDen Otter (1997) challenges popular assumptions that Canada built transcontinental railways because it feared the annexationist schemes of aggressive Americans. Instead Canada overbuilt railroads because it hoped to compete with, even overtake Americans in the race for continental riches. It downplayed the more realistic Maritimes-based London-oriented connections and turned to utopian prospects for the farmlands and minerals of the west.  The result was closer ties between north and south, symbolized by the Grand Trunk's expansion into the American Midwest. These economic links promoted trade, commerce, and the flow of ideas between the two countries, integrating Canada into a North American economy and culture by 1880. About 700,000 Canadians migrated to the U.S. in the late 19th century.<ref>Den Otten, ''The Philosophy of Railways: The Transcontinental Railway Idea in British North America''  (1997); Bill Waiser, ''Saskatchewan: A New History'' (2005) p. 63</ref> The [[Canadian Pacific]], paralleling the American border, opened a vital link to British Canada, and stimulated settlement of the Prairies. The CP was affiliated with [[James J. Hill]]'s American railways, and opened even more connections to the south. The connections were two-way, as thousands of American moved to the Prairies after their own frontier had closed.\n\nTwo additional transcontinental lines were built to the west coast\u2014three in all\u2014but that was far more than the traffic would bear, making the system simply too expensive. One after another, the federal government was forced to take over the lines and cover their deficits. In 1923 the government merged the Grand Trunk, [[Grand Trunk Pacific]], Canadian Northern and National Transcontinental lines into the new [[Canadian National Railways]] system. Since most of the equipment was imported from Britain or the U.S., and most of the products carried were from farms, mines or forests, there was little stimulation to domestic manufacturing. On the other hand, the railways were essential to the growth of the wheat regions in the Prairies, and to the expansion of coal mining, lumbering, and paper making. Improvements to the St. Lawrence waterway system continued apace, and many short lines were built to river ports.<ref>M. L. Bladen, \"Construction of Railways in Canada to the Year 1885\", ''Contributions to Canadian Economics'' Vol. 5 (1932), pp. 43\u201360; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/136530 in JSTOR]; Bladen, \"Construction of Railways in Canada Part II: From 1885 to 1931\", ''Contributions to Canadian Economics'' Vol. 7 (1934), pp. 61\u2013107; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/136554 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Confederation==\n\nThe repeal of the British [[Corn Laws]] and of preferential treatment for the British colonies led many in British North America to realize that the motherland could no longer be counted on economically. In 1854, the Canadian colonies signed [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] with the United States to try to ensure access to the American market. This treaty was cancelled in 1866, however, leaving the colonies once again adrift.\n\nThe railways were also an important factor. The [[Province of Canada]] had again nearly bankrupted itself by promising unwise subsidies to railway companies. The Maritime colonies wanted a railroad, but as disunited as they were, building one would be all but impossible.\n\nBoth the Maritime colonies and the Province of Canada desired access to the large and unexploited western hinterland. They hoped that if these areas were developed they would become a market for their manufactured goods, and provide exports for the eastern ports.\n\nFor these reasons and others, the colonies of [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and the two Canadas agreed to merge into one [[Dominion]] in 1867. While in name it was a [[confederation]], the new constitution, the [[British North America Act, 1867|British North America Act]] outlined a strongly centralized federation. The federal government had control of most of the taxation power, and was responsible for the largest expenditures, railroads, canals and the military. The provinces were given exclusive jurisdiction over what at the time seemed merely local or minor matters such as health care and education. The pledge to build the [[Intercolonial Railway of Canada]] linking the Maritimes to Quebec and Ontario was finally realized in the 1870s.\n\nIn 1871, British Columbia, which was nearing bankruptcy due to railway construction agreed to join the union in exchange for a [[Canadian Pacific Railway|transcontinental railroad]]. [[Prince Edward Island]] joined in 1873 when the national government provided $800,000 for buying out the landlords who held large blocks of island land. All private holdings over 1,000 acres were sold to the province.<ref>Rusty Bittermann and Margaret McCallum, \"Upholding the Land Legislation of a 'Communistic and Socialist Assembly': The Benefits of Confederation for Prince Edward Island,\" ''Canadian Historical Review,'' (March 2006) 87#1 pp 1\u201328</ref>\n\n{{See also|Canadian Confederation}}\n\n==The National Policy==\n{{Main|National Policy}}\nThe first [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] of the new nation was [[John A. Macdonald]], and he outlined what would be Canada's economic program for decades.  This would be the [[National Policy]] a system of protective tariffs that would encourage the development of Canadian manufacturing.  This would be combined with great railway building projects such as the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] to link the east with the west and the [[Intercolonial Railway]] to link central Canada with Atlantic Canada.<ref>Vernon C. Fowke,  \"National Policy and Western Development in North America\" ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 16, No. 4 (Dec., 1956), pp. 461\u2013479 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2114691 in JSTOR]</ref> Other plans for the National Policy were the promotion of Canadian Identity and the population of western Canada.\n\nCanada had traditionally been committed to free trade and had only had one experiment with a protective tariff with the [[Cayley-Galt Tariff]] of 1858. This policy has long been controversial as it is seen to have favoured [[Central Canada]] at the expense of the [[Canadian Maritimes|Maritimes]] and the [[Canadian West|West]].\n\n==Post-Confederation slump==\n\nIn the years after Confederation, the once-buoyant BNA economy soured, an event some blamed on union or government railway policy, but was more likely caused by the [[Long Depression]] that was affecting the entire world.  Demand for Canadian resources slumped, and protectionist policies in the United States and Europe hurt Canada's trade.<ref>P. B.  Waite, ''Canada, 1874\u20131896'' (1971)</ref>\n\nThere was little immigration to Canada during this period.  Despite efforts to settle the west including the [[Dominion Lands Act]] of 1871, few immigrants were willing to settle on Canada's colder and drier prairies when open land was still plentiful in the United States.  In the thirty years after Confederation, Canada experienced a net out flow of migrants, as a large number of Canadians relocated to the United States.\n\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century, the economies of the Canadian Maritimes were the most industrialized, and prosperous in British North America.  The 1850s and 1860s were especially prosperous.  By the start of the twentieth century, however, they were far poorer than the rest of the country, and remain so to this day.  It has been said that the provinces never emerged from the post-Confederation slump.  See [[Maritimes#Economy|Economy of the Maritimes]] for a full discussion of this issue.\n\n==Boom years==\n[[Image:PostcardToCanadaForInvestmentInCanada1907.jpg|thumb|right|Investors from the United Kingdom and the United States helped fuel the country's economic growth (from a postcard sent in 1907).]]\nThe economy of the rest of the country improved dramatically after 1896, and from that year until 1914, Canada had the world's fastest-growing economy.<ref>R. C. Brown and Ramsay Cook, ''Canada, 1896\u20131921 A Nation Transformed'' (1974)</ref>  The west was settled, the population grew quickly, so that by 1900, Prime Minister [[Wilfrid Laurier]] could predict that the twentieth century would be Canada's century as the nineteenth was the United States's.<ref>{{cite web|author=SMC-MCS, gazette@uottawa.ca |url=https://www.uottawa.ca/services/markcom/gazette/000602/000602-art04-e.shtml |title=A prediction that belonged to the 20th century |publisher=Uottawa.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-04-14}}</ref>\nThe cause of this boom is debated.  Whether the settlement of the west was a cause or effect of the boom is one of the most important issues.  Globally the economy was improving with the end of the Long Depression.  The last semi-humid farmland in the United States was exhausted, leaving Canada with the best unexploited farm land in North America.  Technological changes from the steel plow to [[combine harvester]]s played an important role, but perhaps the most important development was the practice of [[dry farming]] that allowed farmers to profitably grow wheat on the semi-arid southern prairies.\n\nThe most noted expansion was in western Canada, but at the same time Central Canada was undergoing a period of significant [[industrialization]].\n\nWhile western and central Canada boomed during the pre-World War I years the economies of the three Maritime provinces grew far more slowly.  There is also much debate over the cause of this, but its consequence was a growing disaffection with Confederation in the east, manifested by the [[Maritime Rights]] movement.\n\n==Farming==\n\n===Ontario===\nIn Ontario farming was generally quite profitable, especially after 1896.  The major changes involved \"mechanization of technology and a shift toward output of high-grade consumer oriented products\", such as milk, eggs and vegetables for the fast-growing urban markets.<ref>D. A. Lawr, \"The Development of Ontario Farming, 1870\u20131914: Patterns of Growth and Change,\" ''Ontario History,'' Sept 1972, Vol. 64 Issue 3, pp 239\u2013251</ref> It took farmers a half century to appreciate the value of high-protein soybean crops. Introduced in the 1890s, acceptance was slow until 1943\u201352, when farmers in the southwestern counties expanded production.<ref>Ian A. McKay, \"A Note on Ontario Agriculture: The Development of Soybeans, 1893\u20131952,\" ''Ontario History,'' June 1983, Vol. 75 Issue 2, pp 175\u2013186</ref> Farmers increasingly demanded more information on the best farming techniques.  Their demands led to farm magazine and agricultural fairs. In 1868 the assembly created an agricultural museum, which morphed into the [[Ontario Agricultural College]] in Guelph in 1874.<ref>John Carter, \"The Education of the Ontario Farmer,\" ''Ontario History,'' May 2004, Vol. 96 Issue 1, pp 62\u201384</ref>\n\n===Prairies===\n[[Image:Palliser's Triangle map.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The Prairie provinces, highlighting Palliser's Triangle]]\nWheat was the golden crop that built the economy of the Prairie provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta and filled outbound trains headed for ports to carry the grain to Europe. The tall grain elevator alongside the railway tracks became a crucial element of the Prairie grain trade after 1890. It boosted \"King Wheat\" to regional dominance by integrating the region's economy with the rest of Canada. Used to efficiently load grain into railroad cars, grain elevators came to be clustered in \"lines\" and their ownership tended to concentrate in the hands of increasingly fewer companies, many controlled by Americans. The main commercial entities involved in the trade were the Canadian Pacific Railway and the powerful grain syndicates. Dramatic changes in the grain trade took place in the 1940s, notably the amalgamation of grain elevator companies.<ref>John Everitt, \"The Line Elevator in Alberta\". ''Alberta History'' [Canada] 1992 40(4): 16\u201322; 1993 41(1): 20\u201326.</ref>\n\nNorrie argues that the necessity of using dry farming techniques created special risks and the farmers responded by using summer fallow rather than the risky but more productive use of substitute crops or the planting of wheat every year. Tenants often preferred the safety of sharecropping to the hazards (and higher returns) of cash rental, and showed an interest in [[crop insurance]]. Because farmers were averse to risk, grain production was less than it might have been.<ref>Kenneth Norrie, \"Dry Farming and the Economics of Risk Bearing: The Canadian Prairies, 1870\u20131930\", ''Agricultural History'', Winter 1977, Vol. 51 Issue 1, pp. 134\u2013148</ref>\n\nRecklessness, greed, and overoptimism played a part in the early-20th-century financial crisis on the Canadian wheat frontier. Beginning in 1916, the [[Palliser Triangle]], a semiarid region in Alberta and Saskatchewan, suffered a decade of dry years and crop failures that culminated in financial ruin for many of the region's wheat farmers. Overconfidence on the part of farmers, financiers, the Canadian Pacific, and the Canadian government led to land investments and development in the Palliser on an unprecedented and dangerous scale. A large share of this expansion was funded by mortgage and loan companies in Britain eager to make overseas investments. British money managers were driven by a complex set of global economic forces including a decline in British investment opportunities, excess capital, and massive investment expansion on the Canadian frontier. Reduced grain production in Europe and increased grain production in the Prairie Provinces also encouraged the export of capital from London. The mythical image of the Palliser as an abundant region, coupled with a growing confidence in technology, created a false sense of security and stability. Between 1908 and 1913 British firms lent vast sums to Canadian farmers to plant their wheat crops; only when the drought began in 1916 did it become clear that far too much credit had been extended.<ref>John Feldberg, and Warren M. Elofson, \"Financing The Palliser Triangle, 1908\u20131913\". ''Great Plains Quarterly'' 1998 18(3): 257\u2013268. 0275\u20137664</ref>\n\n==The First World War and the Roaring Twenties==\n\nCanada played an extraordinarily large role in the [[World War I|First World War]] relative to the size of its population.  It sent over hundreds of thousands of troops, and was also the granary and arms producer for the allied side.  This led to a further boom on the prairies as wheat prices skyrocketed.  The rest of the country, even the Maritimes, benefited from an increase in manufacturing.<ref name=\"Robert Bothwell 1987\">Robert Bothwell,  Ian Drummond, and John English, ''Canada 1900\u20131945'' (1987)</ref>\n\nThe immediate post-war years saw a short, but severe, recession as the economy readjusted to the end of wartime production.  By 1921, the Canadian economy was back on its feet and rapidly expanding.  In the 1920s, there was an unprecedented increase in the standard of living as items that had been luxury goods such as radios, automobiles, and electric  lights\u2014not to mention flush toilets\u2014became common place across the nation.  The boom lasted until 1929.\n\n==The Great Depression==\n{{Main|The Great Depression in Canada}}\n[[File:ReliefWorkHighway.jpg|right|thumb|Road construction at Kimberly-Wasa, British Columbia. The federal government established Relief Projects in 1933 during the height of the Great Depression for unemployed married men of British descent]]\nCanada was hard hit by the [[Great Depression]].  When the American economy began to collapse in the late 1920s the close economic links and the central banking system meant that the malaise quickly spread across the border.  The world demand fell for wheat, lumber and mining products; prices fell, profits plunged, and unemployment soared.\n\nIn May 1930, US raised the tariff with the [[Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act]]. Canada retaliated by imposing new tariffs on 16 products that accounted altogether for around 30% of U.S. exports to Canada.<ref>Richard N. Kottman,  \"Herbert Hoover and the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff: Canada, A Case Study\", ''Journal of American History'' (1975), 62#3 pp 609\u2013635, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2936217 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>McDonald, Judith; O'Brien, Anthony Patrick; Callahan, Colleen \"Trade Wars: Canada's Reaction to the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff\", ''Journal of Economic History'' (1997), 57#4 pp 802\u2013826,  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951161 in JSTOR]</ref>  Following Britain's lead, Canada then forged closer economic links with the [[British Empire]] via the [[British Empire Economic Conference]] of 1932.\n\nBy 1933, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance.  Wages fell as did prices; debts did not fall and they became more burdensome.  [[Gross National Expenditure]] had declined 42% from the 1929 levels.  In some areas, the decline was far worse.  In the rural areas of the prairies two thirds of the population were on relief.  Population growth contracted markedly as immigration slowed, and birth rates fell as people postponed marriage and family life until they were more secure.  Crime rates increased, and a new class of unemployed vagrants appeared.<ref>Pierre Berton, ''The Great Depression: 1929\u20131939'' (1990) is a popular acoount</ref>\n\nLike the United States, Canada remained in depression far longer, not passing 1929 levels until 1939, with the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].  There was no national recovery program similar to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]].\n\n==The Second World War and the boom years==\n\nThe turn around brought about by the command economy imposed at the beginning of the Second World War was immense.  Unemployment virtually disappeared by 1940 as soldiers were recruited and factories turned to war production.  Canada was in the unusual situation of helping Britain financially, through a program similar to the American [[Lend-Lease]].<ref>C. P.  Stacey, ''Arms, Men and Governments: The War Policies of Canada, 1939\u20131945'' (1970)</ref>\n\nIn the twenty-five years after the war, there was an immense expansion in the Canadian economy.  Unemployment remained low and the end of wartime production was quickly turned over to making consumer goods.  Canada, along with many other developed nations, firmly established itself as a [[welfare state]] with publicly funded [[health care]], the [[Canada Pension Plan]], and other programs.<ref>Robert  Bothwell, Ian Drummond, and John English, ''Canada since 1945'' (2d. ed. 1989)</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the Canadian economy became much more closely integrated with the American one as tariff barriers fell and trade agreements like the [[Canada-United States Automotive Agreement]] and the \"Hyde Park Declaration\" were signed.\n\n==Recent years==\n\n===Recession===\nCanada experienced economic [[recession]] in the early 1980s and again in the [[Late 1980s recession|early 1990s]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/recession.html |title=Ecolnomic Concepts: Recession |access-date=20 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325185942/http://www.canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/recession.html |archive-date=25 March 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This led to massive government [[Government budget deficit|deficit]]s, high unemployment, and general disaffection.  The poor economy helped lead to the overwhelming rejection of the\n[[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] in the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 election]], and the fall of other governments such as [[Bob Rae]]'s [[Ontario New Democratic Party]].  The poor economy may have increased support for sovereignty in [[Quebec]], an option that was just barely rejected in the [[1995 Quebec referendum]].\n\nA brief recovery in 1994 was followed by an economic slump in 1995\u20131996. Since that date, the Canadian economy has improved markedly, in step with the boom in the United States. In the mid-1990s, [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]]'s Liberal government began to post annual budgetary surpluses, and steadily paid down the national debt.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Johnson|title=Thinking Government: Public Sector Management in Canada |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcL80sSautgC&pg=PA374|year=2006|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-55111-779-9|page=374}}</ref> Once referred to as a fiscal basket-case {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, Canada has become a model of fiscal stability as the government has posted surpluses every fiscal year from 1996 to the [[Late-2000s recession|2008 recession]].\n\nThe [[Early 2000s recession|recession]] brought on in the United States by the collapse of the [[dot-com bubble]] beginning in 2000, hurt the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] but has affected Canada only mildly.

The son of an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[convict]], he was the younger brother of the bushranger [[Ned Kelly]]. Dan and Ned killed three policemen at Stringybark Creek in northeast [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], near the present-day town of [[Tolmie, Victoria]]. With two friends, [[Joe Byrne (bushranger)|Joe Byrne]] and [[Steve Hart]], the brothers formed the Kelly Gang. They robbed banks, took over whole towns, and kept the people in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]] frightened. For two years the Victorian police searched for them, locked up their friends and families, but could not find them. Dan Kelly died during the infamous [[siege]] of [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]].\n\n\nbooks have been written about the Kelly Gang than any other subject in Australian history. The Kelly Gang were the subject of the world's first full-length [[feature film]], ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', made in 1906.\n\n==Early life==\n\nDan Kelly's father, John Kelly (known as \"Red\") married an Irish woman, Ellen Quinn, in [[Melbourne]] in 1850.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|74}} They had seven children: Annie (1853), Edward \"Ned\" (1854), Maggie (1856), James (1859), Dan (1861), [[Mary Kate Kelly (outlaw)|Kate]] (1862) and Grace (1863).<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|75}}<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|9}}\n \nIn 1864, Dan Kelly's family moved north to a farm at [[Avenel, Victoria|Avenel]]. Red Kelly stole a [[cattle|calf]] and was sent to jail for six months.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|75}} Dan was in trouble with the police when he was five years old because they believed he had stolen a horse.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|75}} Dan's father died in 1866, and in 1867, his mother, Ellen Kelly, moved the family to a small farm near [[Greta, Victoria|Greta]] in north east Victoria.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|30}}\n\nEllen Kelly's two sisters, Catherine and Jane Lloyd, were living at Greta, and her two brothers, John and James Quinn, had moved to the area in 1864.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|30}} The Quinn family were well known to the police. Dan Kelly was again in trouble with the law when he was only 10 years old. He and his brother James, aged 12, were arrested by Constable Flood for riding a horse that did not belong to them. Jim was working for a local farmer and had taken the horse to ride home on. Flood did not believe them, and the boys were forced to spend two nights in a prison cell.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|82}}It later transpired that the farmer had given them permission to borrow the horse.\nIn 1875, like many other young men in north east Victoria, Dan Kelly and his [[cousin]]s, the Lloyds, went to New South Wales to look for [[season]]al farm work in the [[Riverina]] area and on the [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro High Plains]].<ref name =mcm/>{{rp|59}} His group of friends were known as \"the Greta mob\".<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|59}} They went out together to hotels, dances and horse races. By 1876, they were well known for their visits to nearby towns such as [[Wangaratta, Victoria|Wangaratta]], [[Beechworth, Victoria|Beechworth]] and [[Benalla, Victoria|Benalla]].<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|59}}\n\nOn one visit to Benalla in 1876, Dan was arrested for stealing a [[saddle]]. The police let him go when they could not get enough evidence.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|59}} Dan and his cousins got into trouble with the police in October 1877. They had gone to a shop to pick up food and other supplies, but the shop was shut. When the owner refused to open the shop, Dan Kelly broke down the door.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|52}} They were charged with violent [[assault]], damage to [[property]] (the door), breaking into houses and stealing things worth [[Pound (currency)|\u00a3]]113. The boys went into hiding, and the police spent three weeks looking for them. Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick told Ned Kelly to get them to give themselves up.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|52}} In court, the police were not able to prove most of the charges, but Dan went to prison for one month for damaging property worth \u00a310.<ref name =mcq>{{cite book | last =McQuilton | first =John | title = The Kelly Outbreak, 1878 \u2014 1880| publisher =Melbourne University Press | year =1979 | location =Melbourne, Australia | isbn = 0-522-84180-5}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 April 1878, Constable Fitzpatrick, went to the Kelly's house to arrest Dan Kelly for stealing horses. Dan had been seen in [[Chiltern, Victoria|Chiltern]] riding a stolen horse.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|52}} What happened at the house is now called the \"[[Ned Kelly#Fitzpatrick incident|Fitzpatrick incident]]\". There was a fight with Fitzpatrick, and he said the Kelly family had tried to kill him. Dan and Ned went into [[the bush]] to hide. Ellen Kelly was sent to [[gaol]] for three years for attempted [[murder]]. Maggie's husband, William Skillion, and a neighbour, William Williamson, were sent to gaol for six years.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|63}}\n\n==Kelly Gang==\nNed and Dan Kelly went into the bush to a place in the Wombat Ranges. Dan Kelly had built small huts some time earlier on Bullock Creek, where he had cleared an area of about {{convert|20|acre|ha|0|abbr=on}} to keep horses.<ref name=\"kgcs\">{{cite web|url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/vhd/heritagevic#detail_places;104595|title=Kelly Gang Camp Site|work=Heritage Places and Objects|publisher=Heritage Council of Victoria|accessdate=27 February 2010}}</ref> He had also built a small [[still]] for making [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]].<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|89}} The brothers spent their time searching for [[gold]] in the creek.<ref name=kgcs/>\n\nDuring the months they were [[wikt:hide|hiding]] at Bullock Creek, they were often visited by their friends including [[Steve Hart]], [[Joe Byrne (bushranger)|Joe Byrne]], [[Aaron Sherritt]] and the Lloyds.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|78}} The police took the charge of attempted murder very seriously. A [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] of \u00a3100 was offered for the capture of the two Kelly boys.<ref name=\"adb\"/> The police thought the brothers were hiding in the Wombat Ranges. In October 1878, they sent two search groups out to find them. One group travelled south from Greta, and the other started from [[Mansfield, Victoria|Mansfield]] and travelled north.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|90}}\n\n[[File:Stringybark creek1.JPG|thumb|220px|right|Stringybark Creek]]\n\n===Stringybark Creek===\nThe Mansfield group was led by [[Sergeant]] Michael Kennedy, with three [[policeman|policemen]]; [[Constable]]s Thomas McIntyre, Thomas Lonigan, and Michael Scanlon. They set up a camp at an abandoned diggings at Stringybark Creek in a thick forest area.<ref name=\"scs\">{{cite web|url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/vhd/heritagevic#detail_places;13107|title=Stringybark Creek site|work=Heritage Places and Objects|publisher=Heritage Council of Victoria|accessdate=27 February 2010}}</ref> Kennedy and Scanlan went searching for the Kellys, while Lonigan and McIntyre remained at the camp.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|95}} The Kellys were living in a hut close by at Bullock Creek. They heard gunfire and discovered the police camp. They decided to capture the policemen and take their guns and horses.\n\nNed and Dan, and friends Joe Byrne and Steve Hart, went to the police camp and told them to [[wikt:surrender|surrender]].<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|96}} Constable McIntyre put his arms up, but Lonigan tried to run for cover. Ned Kelly shot him dead as Lonigan turned his head back toward Kelly as he ran.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|96}} When the other two police came back to camp, McIntyre told them to surrender. Scanlan was trying to dismount when he saw the attackers and tried to swing his rifle around but Ned shot him dead.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|97}} Kennedy jumped behind his horse and ran shooting from tree to tree with Ned chasing him. During the shooting, Kennedy was wounded. Ned shot him in the chest when he tried to surrender some 800 yards away from the camp.  Then he lined him up and then shot him through the chest at point blank range.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|97}} McIntyre was able to escape during the [[wikt:confusion|confusion]]. It was later reported in the newspapers that it was Dan who had shot Kennedy.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|98}} Dan was wounded during the shooting.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|100}}\n\n===Outlaws===\nThe Victorian government passed a law on 30 October 1878, making the Kelly Gang [[outlaw]]s; they no longer had any legal rights. They could be shot by anyone, at any time, without [[wikt:warning|warning]].<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|103}} Anyone who could [[wikt:capture|capture]] one of the Gang, alive or dead, would be paid a [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] of \u00a3500, or \u00a32,000 for the four men.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|103}}\n\nThe bushrangers were seen at several places around north east Victoria. They had tried to cross the [[Murray River]] into New South Wales, but the water was too deep. The police had several large groups hunting for them. On 10 December, the Kelly Gang robbed the bank at [[Euroa, Victoria|Euroa]].<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|110}} In February 1879, they went to [[Jerilderie, New South Wales]]. They locked the town's policemen in the police station cells, and kept many people hostage in the Royal Mail Hotel for three days. Dan Kelly and Steve Hart kept the people in the hotel, while Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne robbed the bank.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|121}} After the bank robberies, the reward was increased to \u00a32,000 for each man, or the larger amount of \u00a38,000 for the Gang.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|128}}\n\nOver the next 18 months many policemen were sent to north-east Victoria to search for the Kelly Gang.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|140}} The police could not find the bushrangers because they were badly led and they did not know how to live in the bush.  However the Kellys were experts in living in the bush and they had the support of some local people.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|151}}\n\n===Murder===\n[[File:Dan kelly armour.jpg|thumbnail|Dan Kelly's and Steve Hart's armour recovered from the hotel after it was burnt. In the foreground is Ned Kelly's rifle and skull cap.]]\n[[File:Dan Kelly 2.JPG|thumb|220px|right|Dan Kelly's helmet on display at the Victoria Police Museum, Melbourne]]\nIn June 1880, the Kelly Gang came out of hiding. They knew that Joe Byrne's friend, Aaron Sherritt, had been giving information to the police. Four policemen were staying at Sherritt's house, near Beechworth, to protect him. Dan Kelly and Byrne went to Sherritt's house late at night and took hostage his neighbour, a German called Weekes and used him to trick Sherritt out of the house. When Sherritt opened the door, Byrne shot him dead.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|155}} The policemen were hiding under the bed. Kelly and Byrne rode quickly back to Glenrowan where Ned Kelly and Hart had forced many of the town people into a hotel, the Glenrowan Inn.<ref name=ghp/> They also had forced railway workers to pull up the train tracks. They knew that more police would be sent by train to Beechworth to find them. They wanted the train to crash when it reached the place where tracks had been removed near Glenrowan.<ref name=\"ghp\">{{cite web|url=http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/vhd/heritagevic#detail_places;4073|title=Glenrowan Heritage Precinct|work=Heritage Places and Objects|publisher=Heritage Council of Victoria|accessdate=27 February 2010}}</ref> The bushrangers, wearing homemade [[Armour of the Kelly gang|armour]], would then capture any of the policemen that were alive after the crash.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|153}} With the police out of the way, the Kelly Gang would then go into Benalla and rob the bank.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|153}} The captured police would be [[wikt:release|released]] when Ellen Kelly, William Williamson, and William Skillion, were let out of gaol.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|153}}\n\nThe plan did not work because the four policemen did not come out of Sherritt's house until the morning.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|156}} This meant that the news of the murder did not reach Melbourne as quickly as the Kelly Gang had hoped. The people held prisoner in the hotel became restless. Ned organised music and Dan joined in dancing to keep the people in the hotel entertained.<ref>{{cite book | last =Sheppard | first = Barrie| title =Ned Kelly | publisher = Heinemann Library| year =2000 | location = Melbourne, Victoria| page =23 | isbn =1-86391-971-6 }}</ref> Dan also organised some sporting games including [[long jump]] and [[triple jump|hop, step and jump]].<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|160}} Dan wanted to leave Glenrowan when they knew the plan was not going to work because the train was late.<ref name=\"dk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ironoutlaw.com/html/gang.html|title=Dan Kelly|work=The Kelly Gang|publisher=Iron Outlaw|accessdate=28 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709163817/http://www.ironoutlaw.com/html/gang.html|archive-date=9 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ned Kelly let [[Thomas Curnow]], the school master, go home to his wife.

They put on their suits of armour and went on to the [[verandah]] of the hotel to wait for the police.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|159}} In the first few shots, police Superintendent Hare, Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne were wounded, and Jack Jones, son of the hotel owner was fatally wounded. Ned Kelly, who was dressed in his armour, was able to leave the hotel and kept shooting at the police. The police fired their guns into the hotel building for seven hours. It is [[wikt:estimate|estimated]] that 15,000 [[bullet]]s were fired during the shooting.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/ned-kelly-bullets-found/story-e6frf7kx-1111116251401 |title=Bullets from Ned Kelly's shoot-out at Glenrowan found |work=heraldsun.com.au |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> Byrne died after being shot in the [[groin]]. Ned Kelly went back to the hotel but he could not find Dan or Steve Hart who were hiding in a back room. He again left and tried to find his horse. Ned Kelly was shot in the legs as he searched outside for his brother.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|162}} The police were then easily able to capture him.\n\nAt 10.00 am there was a large crowd of people watching the action. Police Inspector Sadleir was forced to stop the shooting to allow many of the hostages to escape. He would not let Dan's sister Maggie, or a [[Catholic]] priest, Father Gibney, go into the hotel to tell the men to give themselves up. Instead, he ordered that a [[cannon]] be sent from Melbourne so that they could destroy the hotel.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|162}}\n\nAt 2.30 pm, the police set fire to the building to try to make the rest of the Kelly Gang leave the building.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|189}} Father Gibney ignored the police and went into the burning building.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|162}} He found Dan Kelly and Steve Hart dead in a back room of the hotel. He said their bodies were lying side by side, their heads resting on blankets.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|162}} Byrne's body was dragged out of the hotel, but the bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire. People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were only able to tell which was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hart by their size.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|30}} They were placed on sheets of bark from a tree and [[photograph]]ed. Three Glenrowan people held hostage inside the hotel died during the siege.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|159\u2013163}}\n\nFamily members, including his sisters, Kate and Maggie, and friends took the bodies back to Greta.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|195}} The police tried to get the bodies back, and sent a group of 16 policemen to Greta, but they became worried that this would start another fight and they went back to Benalla.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|208}} Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were buried in unmarked [[grave]]s at Greta, on 30 June 1880.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|164}} About 100 people were at the [[funeral]], with Dan's cousin, Tom Lloyd, as the [[undertaker]], and a Greta farmer, Daniel O'Keefe, acting as a [[preacher]].

The son of an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[convict]], he was the younger brother of the bushranger [[Ned Kelly]]. Dan and Ned killed three policemen at Stringybark Creek in northeast [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], near the present-day town of [[Tolmie, Victoria]]. With two friends, [[Joe Byrne (bushranger)|Joe Byrne]] and [[Steve Hart]], the brothers formed the Kelly Gang. They robbed banks, took over whole towns, and kept the people in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]] frightened. For two years the Victorian police searched for them, locked up their friends and families, but could not find them. Dan Kelly died during the infamous [[siege]] of [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]].\n\nMore books have been written about the Kelly Gang than any other subject in Australian history. The Kelly Gang were the subject of the world's first full-length [[feature film]], ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', made in 1906.\n\n==Early life==\n\nDan Kelly's father, John Kelly (known as \"Red\") married an Irish woman, Ellen Quinn, in [[Melbourne]] in 1850.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|74}} They had seven children: Annie (1853), Edward \"Ned\" (1854), Maggie (1856), James (1859), Dan (1861), [[Mary Kate Kelly (outlaw)|Kate]] (1862) and Grace (1863).<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|75}}<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|9}}\n \nIn 1864, Dan Kelly's family moved north to a farm at [[Avenel, Victoria|Avenel]]. Red Kelly stole a [[cattle|calf]] and was sent to jail for six months.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|75}} Dan was in trouble with the police when he was five years old because they believed he had stolen a horse.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|75}} Dan's father died in 1866, and in 1867, his mother, Ellen Kelly, moved the family to a small farm near [[Greta, Victoria|Greta]] in north east Victoria.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|30}}\n\nEllen Kelly's two sisters, Catherine and Jane Lloyd, were living at Greta, and her two brothers, John and James Quinn, had moved to the area in 1864.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|30}} The Quinn family were well known to the police. Dan Kelly was again in trouble with the law when he was only 10 years old. He and his brother James, aged 12, were arrested by Constable Flood for riding a horse that did not belong to them. Jim was working for a local farmer and had taken the horse to ride home on. Flood did not believe them, and the boys were forced to spend two nights in a prison cell.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|82}}It later transpired that the farmer had given them permission to borrow the horse.\nIn 1875, like many other young men in north east Victoria, Dan Kelly and his [[cousin]]s, the Lloyds, went to New South Wales to look for [[season]]al farm work in the [[Riverina]] area and on the [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro High Plains]].<ref name =mcm/>{{rp|59}} His group of friends were known as \"the Greta mob\".<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|59}} They went out together to hotels, dances and horse races. By 1876, they were well known for their visits to nearby towns such as [[Wangaratta, Victoria|Wangaratta]], [[Beechworth, Victoria|Beechworth]] and [[Benalla, Victoria|Benalla]].<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|59}}\n\nOn one visit to Benalla in 1876, Dan was arrested for stealing a [[saddle]]. The police let him go when they could not get enough evidence.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|59}} Dan and his cousins got into trouble with the police in October 1877. They had gone to a shop to pick up food and other supplies, but the shop was shut. When the owner refused to open the shop, Dan Kelly broke down the door.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|52}} They were charged with violent [[assault]], damage to [[property]] (the door), breaking into houses and stealing things worth [[Pound (currency)|\u00a3]]113. The boys went into hiding, and the police spent three weeks looking for them. Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick told Ned Kelly to get them to give themselves up.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|52}} In court, the police were not able to prove most of the charges, but Dan went to prison for one month for damaging property worth \u00a310.<ref name =mcq>{{cite book | last =McQuilton | first =John | title = The Kelly Outbreak, 1878 \u2014 1880| publisher =Melbourne University Press | year =1979 | location =Melbourne, Australia | isbn = 0-522-84180-5}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 April 1878, Constable Fitzpatrick, went to the Kelly's house to arrest Dan Kelly for stealing horses. Dan had been seen in [[Chiltern, Victoria|Chiltern]] riding a stolen horse.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|52}} What happened at the house is now called the \"[[Ned Kelly#Fitzpatrick incident|Fitzpatrick incident]]\". There was a fight with Fitzpatrick, and he said the Kelly family had tried to kill him. Dan and Ned went into [[the bush]] to hide. Ellen Kelly was sent to [[gaol]] for three years for attempted [[murder]]. Maggie's husband, William Skillion, and a neighbour, William Williamson, were sent to gaol for six years.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|63}}\n\n==Kelly Gang==\nNed and Dan Kelly went into the bush to a place in the Wombat Ranges.

A [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] of \u00a3100 was offered for the capture of the two Kelly boys.<ref name=\"adb\"/> The police thought the brothers were hiding in the Wombat Ranges. In October 1878, they sent two search groups out to find them.

They heard gunfire and discovered the police camp. They decided to capture the policemen and take their guns and horses.\n\nNed and Dan, and friends Joe Byrne and Steve Hart, went to the police camp and told them to [[wikt:surrender|surrender]].<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|96}} Constable McIntyre put his arms up, but Lonigan tried to run for cover. Ned Kelly shot him dead as Lonigan turned his head back toward Kelly as he ran.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|96}} When the other two police came back to camp, McIntyre told them to surrender. Scanlan was trying to dismount when he saw the attackers and tried to swing his rifle around but Ned shot him dead.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|97}} Kennedy jumped behind his horse and ran shooting from tree to tree with Ned chasing him. During the shooting, Kennedy was wounded. Ned shot him in the chest when he tried to surrender some 800 yards away from the camp.  Then he lined him up and then shot him through the chest at point blank range.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|97}} McIntyre was able to escape during the [[wikt:confusion|confusion]]. It was later reported in the newspapers that it was Dan who had shot Kennedy.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|98}} Dan was wounded during the shooting.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|100}}\n\n===Outlaws===\nThe Victorian government passed a law on 30 October 1878, making the Kelly Gang [[outlaw]]s; they no longer had any legal rights.

They had tried to cross the [[Murray River]] into New South Wales, but the water was too deep. The police had several large groups hunting for them. On 10 December, the Kelly Gang robbed the bank at [[Euroa, Victoria|Euroa]].<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|110}} In February 1879, they went to [[Jerilderie, New South Wales]]. They locked the town's policemen in the police station cells, and kept many people hostage in the Royal Mail Hotel for three days. Dan Kelly and Steve Hart kept the people in the hotel, while Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne robbed the bank.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|121}} After the bank robberies, the reward was increased to \u00a32,000 for each man, or the larger amount of \u00a38,000 for the Gang.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|128}}\n\nOver the next 18 months many policemen were sent to north-east Victoria to search for the Kelly Gang.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|140}} The police could not find the bushrangers because they were badly led and they did not know how to live in the bush.  However the Kellys were experts in living in the bush and they had the support of some local people.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|151}}\n\n===Murder===\n[[File:Dan kelly armour.jpg|thumbnail|Dan Kelly's and Steve Hart's armour recovered from the hotel after it was burnt.

They knew that Joe Byrne's friend, Aaron Sherritt, had been giving information to the police. Four policemen were staying at Sherritt's house, near Beechworth, to protect him. Dan Kelly and Byrne went to Sherritt's house late at night and took hostage his neighbour, a German called Weekes and used him to trick Sherritt out of the house. When Sherritt opened the door, Byrne shot him dead.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|155}} The policemen were hiding under the bed. Kelly and Byrne rode quickly back to Glenrowan where Ned Kelly and Hart had forced many of the town people into a hotel, the Glenrowan Inn.<ref name=ghp/> They also had forced railway workers to pull up the train tracks. They knew that more police would be sent by train to Beechworth to find them.

Ned Kelly, who was dressed in his armour, was able to leave the hotel and kept shooting at the police. The police fired their guns into the hotel building for seven hours.

Police Inspector Sadleir was forced to stop the shooting to allow many of the hostages to escape. He would not let Dan's sister Maggie, or a [[Catholic]] priest, Father Gibney, go into the hotel to tell the men to give themselves up. Instead, he ordered that a [[cannon]] be sent from Melbourne so that they could destroy the hotel.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|162}}\n\nAt 2.30 pm, the police set fire to the building to try to make the rest of the Kelly Gang leave the building.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|189}} Father Gibney ignored the police and went into the burning building.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|162}} He found Dan Kelly and Steve Hart dead in a back room of the hotel. He said their bodies were lying side by side, their heads resting on blankets.<ref name=mcq/>{{rp|162}} Byrne's body was dragged out of the hotel, but the bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire. People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were only able to tell which was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hart by their size.<ref name=mcm/>{{rp|30}} They were placed on sheets of bark from a tree and [[photograph]]ed.
