The Aura also used hydraulic power steering (V-6 models only) that provided more feedback and a more linear feel than the fussy electric power-assist units. For 2009, an entry level XR became available.  It included the 17 inch 10 spoke alloy wheels available on the XE and the 2.4 L [[GM Ecotec engine#LE5|LE5 Ecotec]] engine mated to GM's all new [[GM 6T40 transmission|6T40]] 6-speed automatic transmission with TAPshift.

The Aura also used hydraulic power steering (V-6 models only) that provided more feedback and a more linear feel than the fussy electric power-assist units. For 2009, an entry level XR became available.  It included the 17 inch 10 spoke alloy wheels available on the XE and the 2.4 L [[GM Ecotec engine#LE5|LE5 Ecotec]] engine mated to GM's all new [[GM 6T40 transmission|6T40]] 6-speed automatic transmission with TAPshift.

{"title_page": "Environmental policy of the United States", "text_new": "The '''environmental policy of the United States''' is a federal governmental action to regulate activities that have an environmental impact in the [[United States]]. The goal of [[environmental policy]] is to protect the environment for future generations while interfering as little as possible with the efficiency of commerce or the liberty of the people and to limit inequity in who is burdened with environmental costs. As his first official act bringing in the 1970s, President Richard Nixon signed the U.S. [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) into law on New Years Day, 1970. Also in the same year, America began celebrating [[Earth Day]], which has been called \"the big bang of U.S. environmental politics, launching the country on a sweeping social learning curve about ecological management never before experienced or attempted in any other nation.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Environmental Politics and Policy |last=Rosenbaum |first=Walter |edition=10th |publisher=CQ Press |year=2016 |isbn=9781506345376 |location= |page=9}}</ref> NEPA established a comprehensive US national environmental policy and created the requirement to prepare an environmental impact statement for \u201cmajor federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the environment.\u201d Author and consultant [[Charles H. Eccleston]] has called NEPA, the world's \u201cenvironmental Magna Carta\u201d.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eccleston |first=Charles H.|title=Global Environmental Policy: Concepts, Principles, and Practice |date=2010 |isbn=978-1439847664}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[environmental movement in the United States]], environmental policy continued to mature in the 1970s as several broad environmental laws were passed, regulating air and water pollution and forming the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). Partially due to the high costs associated with these regulations, there has been a backlash from business and politically [[conservatism|conservative]] interests, limiting increases to environmental regulatory budgets and slowing efforts to protect the environment. Since the 1970s, despite frequent legislative gridlock, there have been significant achievements in environmental regulation, including increases in air and water quality and, to a lesser degree, control of [[hazardous waste]]. Due to increasing [[scientific consensus on global warming]] and political pressure from environmental groups, modifications to the [[Energy policy of the United States|United States energy policy]] and limits on [[greenhouse gas]] have been suggested.\n\nAs established under NEPA, the US was the first nation in the world to introduce the concept of preparing an [[environmental impact statement]] (EIS) to evaluate the alternatives and impacts of proposed federal actions.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Eccleston |first=Charles H. |title=The EIS Book: Managing and Preparing Environmental Impact Statements |date=2010 |publisher=CRC Press |pages=}}</ref> The EIS process is designed to forge federal policies, programs, projects, and plans.<ref>U.S. Council on Environmental Quality. ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|40|1500}}</ref> A large percentage of nations around the world have adopted provisions that emulate the American EIS process.\n\n==Policy tools==\n[[File:An example of US Federal Environmental Regulations, 1987.jpg|thumb|right|[[Federal Register]] documents and literature related to US environmental regulations, including the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA), 1987]]\nThe two major policy tools for protecting the environment are rules and inducements. The United States has chosen to use rules, primarily through regulation. Such regulations can come in the form of design standards and [[Emission standard|performance standards]]. Performance standards specify emission levels and let those covered by the rules decide how those levels will be met. Design standards specify exactly how performance standards will be met.\n\nAlternatively, the government can use inducements, or \"market reform\". Inducements are rewards and punishments used to influence people or groups. The two major types of market reforms are charge systems, such as [[Ecotax|emissions taxes]], and \"[[Emissions trading|tradable permit systems]]\". One type of tradable permit system is an \"auction of pollution rights\" in which the amount of allowed pollution is set and divided into units, which are then auctioned, giving environmental organizations the opportunity to buy the units to create a cleaner environment than originally planned. Such a plan was implemented for SO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the 1990 [[Acid Rain Program]] and has been undertaken for greenhouse gases on a regional scale as a way to [[mitigation of global warming|mitigate global warming]].\n\n==Power delegation and policy jurisdiction==\n\n===Executive branch===\nGovernmental authority on [[environmental issues in the United States]] is highly fragmented. While the EPA is the most comprehensive environmental agency, its authority on these matters is not absolute. Virtually all of the [[United States federal executive departments|executive branch's departments]] have some area of environmental authority. This contributes somewhat to the cost and questionable efficacy of the United States' environmental regulation.\n\nAs chief execute, the President plays an important role in environmental policy. President's such as Teddy Roosevelt, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Richard Nixon]] have acted as \"bully pulpit\" to gain support for environmental legislation. Their role as chief diplomat enables them to enact international agreements with environmental stipulations. Ronald Reagan signed the Montreal Protocol, Obama was a leader in negotiating the Paris agreement and the Bush administration rejected the Kyoto protocol. Presidents can use their \"soft\" power to draw attention to environmental issues and set broad administrative goals. They can veto legislation and, through executive orders, regulate administrative behavior.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vig |first1=Norman |last2=Kraft |first2=Michael |title=Environmental Policy |date=2019 |publisher=Sage |pages=88\u2013109}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|'''Federal Agency'''||'''Environmental Responsibilities'''\n|-\n|[[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House Office]]||Overall policy, Agency coordination\n|-\n|[[Office of Management and Budget]]||Budget, Agency coordination and management\n|-\n|[[Council on Environmental Quality]]||Environmental policy, Agency coordination, [[Environmental impact statement]]s\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]||Health\n|-\n|[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]||Air and water pollution, Solid waste, Radiation, Pesticides, Noise, Toxic substances\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]||Environmental litigation\n|-\n|[[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]||Public lands, Energy, Minerals, National parks\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]]||Forestry, Soil, Conservation\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]||Civil works construction, [[Clean Water Act#Dredge and fill permits (wetlands)|Dredge and fill permits]], Pollution control from defense facilities\n|-\n|[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]||License and regulate [[Nuclear power in the United States|nuclear power]]\n|-\n|[[United States Department of State|Department of State]]||International environment\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]]||Oceanic and atmospheric monitoring and research\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]]||Occupational health\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]]||Housing, Urban parks, Urban planning\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]]||[[Public transport|Mass transit]], Roads, [[Aircraft noise]], Oil pollution\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]||Energy policy coordination, Petroleum allocation research and development\n|-\n|[[Tennessee Valley Authority]]||Electric power generation\n|-\n|[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]||Cleaning up the natural disasters caused by climate change\n|-\n|[[Department of Homeland Security]]|[[United States Coast Guard]]||Maritime and environmental stewardship, National Pollution Funds Center (NPFC)\n|}\n\n===Legislative branch===\nFragmentation within the executive branch is duplicated in Congress and within the states.  In other words, congress shares authority with the president for environmental federal policy.  Congress can have a major impact on policy through legislative and oversight hearings.  They also have the ability to influence policy by publishing studies and reports, making speeches and introducing legislation. The EPA is the concern of almost two-thirds of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]' standing committees and subcommittees and a similar percentage in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Some seventy committees and subcommittees control water quality policy, for example. Such fragmentation creates both opportunities and problems. While such a variety of committees provide enormous access for environmentalist and industry groups to lobby, the division of tasks means that no one committee or agency looks at environmental problems as a whole.  Building policy consensus in Congress is rarely easy because of the diversity of interests and of members whose concerns need to be met.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Senate

more environmental laws in the United States, both at the federal and [[U.S. state|state]] levels. The [[common law]] of [[property]] and [[takings]] also play an important role in environmental issues. In addition, the law of [[standing (law)|standing]], relating to who has a right to bring a lawsuit, is an important issue in environmental law in the United States.\n\n===Origins of the environmental movement===\n{{Main|Environmental movement in the United States}}\nThe history of environmental law in the United States can be traced back to early roots in [[common law]] doctrines, for example, the law of [[nuisance]] and the [[public trust doctrine]]. The first statutory environmental law was the [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899]], which has been largely superseded by the Clean Water Act. However, most current major environmental statutes, such as the federal statutes listed above, were passed during the modern environmental movement spanning the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Prior to the passage of these statutes, most federal environmental laws were not nearly as comprehensive.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe precursor of the modern environmental movement in the United States was the early 20th century [[conservation movement]], associated with President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Gifford Pinchot]]. During this period, the [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] was formed and public concern for consumer protection began, epitomized by the publication of ''[[The Jungle]]'' by [[Upton Sinclair]]. The modern environmental movement was inspired in part by the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s controversial 1962 book ''[[Silent Spring]]'', which pointed out the perils of pesticide use and rallied concern for the environment in general. Carson argued that nature deserved human protection and referred to pesticides as the atomic bomb for insects. She stated that these pesticides would cycle through the environment hurting humans and nature and thought they should be used wisely. Carson played a big role in environment activism that was later to come.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |title=The World Transformed: 1945 to the present |last=Hunt |first=Michael |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-19-937102-0 |location=New York |pages=215\u2013216}}</ref> Along with critiques of the misuse of technology from figures such as [[William Ophuls]], [[Barry Commoner]] and [[Garrett Hardin]], the ineffectiveness and criticism of the 1960s-era Clean Air and Clean Water acts gave a burgeoning momentum to the environmental movement.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dye |first=Thomas |title=Understanding Public Policy |year=2011 |publisher=Longman |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-75742-8 |page=227}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to growing public support, structural changes such as Congressional reform and new access to the courts gave environmentalists new power to enact change. The movement that formed held three key values: [[Social ecology (theory)|ecology]], health, and [[sustainability]]. These values\u2014that we depend and are interconnected with the environment, that insults to the environment can affect our health, and that we should limit our dependence on non-renewable resources\u2014along with a uniquely sympathetic president and Congress, led to great environmental policy change in the 1970s. In 1972 the Club of Rome report came out which was a scholarly effort to gauge the severity of the environmental problem.  A team of researchers concluded with one of the most alarming appraisals of the time and set off widespread debates over the findings, its methods, and policy implications. The model was built mainly to investigate major trends of global concerns such as accelerating industrialization, rapid population growth, widespread malnutrition, depletion of nonrenewable resources and a deteriorating environment. They concluded that if the present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion remains unchanged than the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOne lawsuit that has been widely recognized as one of the earliest environmental cases is ''Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission,'' decided in 1965 by the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]], prior to passage of the major federal environmental statutes.<ref>[http://openjurist.org/354/f2d/608 ''Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v.

Later in the year, Nixon created the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), which consolidated environmental programs from other agencies into a single entity. The legislation during this period concerned primarily first-generation pollutants in the air, surface water, groundwater, and solid waste disposal. Air pollutants such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], and [[ozone]] were put under regulation, and issues such as [[acid rain]], [[visibility]], and [[global warming]] were also concerns. In surface water, the pollutants of concern were [[conventional pollutant]]s ([[bacteria]], [[biochemical oxygen demand]] and [[total suspended solids|suspended solids]]), dissolved solids, nutrients, and toxic substances such as metals and pesticides. For groundwater, the pollutants included biological contaminants, inorganic and organic substances, and [[radionuclide]]s. Finally, solid waste contaminants from agriculture, industry, mining, municipalities, and other sectors were put under control.\n\nThe Clean Air Act amendments of 1970 (CAA) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments of 1972 (Clean Water Act) moved environmental concerns in a new direction.\n\nThe new CAA standards that were to be promulgated were unattainable with existing technology\u2014they were technology-forcing. The standards that the EPA put into place called mainly for state implementation. Each state prepared state implementation plans (SIPs), requiring EPA approval. The 1970 CAA also established deadlines and penalties for automobile emission standards in new cars, resulting in the development and adoption of [[catalytic converter]]s and greatly reducing automobile pollution.\n\nFor wastewater, each discharging facility was required to obtain a permit, and EPA began to issue new federal standards (\"[[effluent guidelines]]\") that required industries to use the \"[[best available technology]]\" for treating their wastes. Congress also established a massive public works program to assist in the construction of [[sewage treatment]] plants for municipalities, and most plants were required to meet [[secondary treatment]] standards.\n\nPolitical scientists Byron Daines and Glenn Sussman have evaluated all the presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to George W. Bush on their environmentalism. in their judgment,  all the Democrats are evaluated as having a positive impact on the environment, along with one Republican: Nixon. Capital the other five Republicans had a mixed impact (Eisenhower, Ford and George H.W. Bush), or negative impacts (Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush).<ref>Byron Daines and Glenn Sussman , ''White House politics and the Environment'' (2010) page v.</ref> Daines and Sussman conclude their analysis by identifying six major achievements for which they give credit to Nixon.<ref>Daines and Sussman , ''White House politics and the Environment'' (2010) pages 82-83, summarizing their review of Nixon on pages 66-83.</ref>\n*He broadened the attention span of the Republican Party to include environmental issues, for the first time since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. He thereby \"dislodged the Democratic Party from its position of dominance over the environment.\"\n* He used presidential powers, and promoted legislation in Congress to create a permanent political structure, most notably the Environmental Protection Agency, the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and others.\n* He helped ensure that Congress build a permanent structure supportive of environmentalism, especially the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, which enjoined all federal agencies to help protect the environment.\n* Nixon appointed a series of strong environmentalists in two highly visible positions{{which|date=October 2019}} including [[William Ruckelshaus]], [[Russell Train]], [[Russell W. Peterson]], and John C. Whitaker (who was a senior White House aide for four years, becoming Undersecretary of the Interior in 1973).\n* Nixon initiated worldwide diplomatic attention to environmental issues, working especially with [[NATO]].\n* Finally, they assert: \"Nixon did not have to be personally committed to the environment to become one of the most successful presidents in promoting environmental priorities.\"<ref>Daines and Sussman , ''White House politics and the Environment'' (2010) pp 82-83.</ref>\n\n====The Ford Administration (1974-1977)====\nEnvironmentalism was a peripheral issue during the short administration of [[Presidency of Gerald Ford|Gerald Ford, 1974\u20131977.]] His primary concern was a stable economy, and environmental issues were sacrificed against policies for economic growth. Environmentalists left over from the Nixon days, such as EPA head Russell Train were frustrated, while opponents of environmentalism such as [[Thomas S. Kleppe]]. As Secretary of the Interior, Kleppe was a leader of the \u201c[[Sagebrush Rebellion]]\u201d in which Western ranchers had the support of state government in 15 Western states who passed laws and launched litigation to try to nullify federal environmental protections that interfered with their business. They lost repeatedly in the federal courts, most notably in the Supreme Court decision in [[Kleppe v. New Mexico]] (1976).<ref>Robert L. Fischman and Jeremiah I. Williamson. \"The Story of Kleppe v. New Mexico: The Sagebrush Rebellion as Un-Cooperative Federalism.\" ''University of Colorado Law Review'' 83 (2011): 123+ [https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1454&context=facpub online]</ref>\n\nFord's successes included the addition of two national monuments six historical sites, three historic parks and two national preserves. None were controversial. He signed the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (1974) and the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (1976), two of the landmark laws approved in the \"environmental decade.\" In the international field, agreements with Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, the Soviet Union and several European countries included provisions to protect endangered species. Ford narrowly defeated Ronald Reagan for renomination in 1976, when environmental issues were not at issue. He was defeated by Jimmy Carter, who attacked Ford's environmental record.<ref>Byron W.

Bush'' (2010) pp 139-54.</ref>\n\n====The Carter Administration (1977-1981)====\nJimmy Carter supported many of the goals of the environmentalist movement, and appointed prominent environmentalists to high positions. As president his rhetoric strongly supported environmentalism, with a certain softness regarding his acceptance of nuclear energy; he been trained in nuclear energy with atomic submarines in the Navy.<ref>Byron W. Daynes and Glen Sussman, ''White House Politics and the Environment: Franklin D. Roosevelt to George W. Bush'' (2010) pp 84-100.</ref> Carter signed several significant bills to protect the environment, including the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977]], which regulates strip mining.<ref>Robert A. Strong, \"Jimmy Carter: Domestic affairs\" [https://millercenter.org/president/carter/domestic-affairs Miller Center]</ref> In 1980 Carter signed into law a bill that established [[Superfund]], a federal program designed to clean up sites contaminated with hazardous substances. \n\nBy midterm, however, Carter's inability to work closely with the Democratic Congress meant it many initiatives were never passed, to the great disappointment of his supporters. Carter's weakness was exhibited in his 1977 decision to eliminate funding for 19 water resource construction projects, despite strong objections from congressmen who favored the programs. Carter distrusted the programs, based on his own troubled gubernatorial experience with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], his campaign rhetoric and the rhetoric of his environmentalist supporters, compounded by his lack of experience with Congress. He was forced to retreat, and lost much of his influence on Capitol Hill. Democrats in Congress were displeased with his moralistic, executive-oriented, rational approach to decision-making and his reluctance adjustment to go along with standard congressional methods of compromise, patronage, and [[logrolling]].<ref>Paul E. Scheele, \"President carter and the water projects: a case study in presidential and congressional decision-making.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 8.4 (1978): 348-364. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27547421 Online]</ref>\n\nCarter was successful in the long term in his energy policy, although his poor publicity apparatus obscured that success during his time in office. Americans had become alarmingly dependent on imported oil, purchasing about a fourth of all the [[OPEC]] production. American consumption per capita was more than double that of Europe or Japan. Carter's goal was to reverse this dependence. He supported the 1977 laws creating the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], and the Emergency Natural Gas Act, and created the [[Synthetic Fuels Corporation]], funded with $20 billion for joint ventures with the private sector.<ref>Robert A.

He convinced Carter to withdraw nearly half of 375 million acres of public domain land from commercial use in a series of executive moves and new laws. In December 1978 the President placed more 56 million acres of the state's federal lands into the [[National Park Service#National Park System|National Park System]], protecting them from mineral or oil development. The 1980 [[Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act]] doubled the amount of public land set aside for national parks and wildlife refuges. Carter used his power under the 1906 [[Antiquities Act]] to set aside 57 million acres in 17 national monuments. The remaining acres were withdrawn under the [[Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976]].<ref>Stephen W.

As Reagan entered office, he was given two transition reports. One report was \"[[Mandate for Leadership]]\" from the [[Heritage Foundation]] and the other was \"Avoiding a GOP Economic Dunkirk\" from conservative Congressman [[David Stockman]](R-MI). Each report called for drastic changes in environmental regulation, primarily through administrative changes. In pursuit of this strategy, Reagan gradually reduced the EPA's budget by 30% through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, cut the number of EPA employees, and appointed people at key agency positions who would enthusiastically follow the administration line. Appointees such as [[Anne Burford]] at the EPA and [[James G. Watt]] at the Department of the Interior were overtly hostile to environmental protection. Through his appointments, Reagan changed the operations of environmental protection from stiff regulation to \"cooperative regulation.\" (Burford and most of her Assistant Administrators were forced to resign in 1983 due to scandals involving their mismanagement of Superfund and other EPA programs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-Official of E.P.A. Indicted Over Dispute With Congress |url=https://nyti.ms/29JLF6v |date=1983-05-28 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>)\n\nUnder this administrative strategy of regulatory relief, environmental laws were written and interpreted more favorably for industry interests. The [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) was also given new powers to write regulations. During the first Reagan administration, the OMB was given the power to require a favorable cost-benefit analysis of any regulation before it could be implemented. This was used to delay new regulations, and changes that resulted in regulatory relief often had this requirement waived. At the beginning of the second Reagan administration, the OMB was given more power. All regulatory agencies were required to submit proposals each year for all major environmental regulation, which allowed OMB to reduce regulatory efforts before such proposed regulations became public.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book |title=The Republican reversal: conservatives and the environment from Nixon to Trump |last=Turner |first=James Morton |last2=Isenberg |first2=Andrew C. |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2018 |isbn=9780674979970 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |pages=102\u2013110 |oclc=1023100262}}</ref>\n\nWithin few months from entering the White House, Reagan removed the solar panels that his predecessor Carter had installed on the roof of the White House's West Wing. \"Reagan's political philosophy viewed the free market as the best arbiter of what was good for the country.

W. Bush Administration (1989\u20131993)====\nEnvironmental policy during the first Bush administration contained a mixture of innovation and restriction. [[George H. W.

While previous regulatory-relief efforts, such as Reagan's use of OMB, were subject to [[Congressional oversight]], the Council on Competitiveness was independent and was not required to keep records of its proceedings. The Council on Competitiveness received its authority from a White House memoranda and its members included Vice President Dan Quayle, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Duffy |first1=Robert J. |date=1996 |title=Divided Government and Institutional Combat: The Case of the Quayle Council on Competitiveness |url= |journal=Polity |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=379\u2013399 |doi=10.2307/3235378 |jstor=3235378}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Bush opposed international efforts at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]] by refusing to sign the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|biodiversity treaty]] and lobbying to remove all binding targets from the proposal on limiting [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|global carbon dioxide emissions]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Greenhouse |first=Steven |date=1992-06-14 |title=A Closer Look: Ecology, the Economy, and Bush |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D81E3CF937A25755C0A964958260 |work=New York Times}}</ref>\n\n====The Clinton Administration (1993\u20132001)====\nThe [[Bill Clinton administration]] promised a change in the direction of environmental policy. [[Al Gore]], the Vice President, and appointees such as [[Carol Browner]] at EPA and [[Bruce Babbitt]] at Interior were all encouraging from an environmental standpoint. Clinton eliminated the Council on Competitiveness, returning regulatory authority to agency heads, and Clinton and Gore argued that environmental protection and economic growth were not incompatible.<ref>Paul Rauber \"Does he deserve your vote? \u2013 Bill Clinton's environmental record\".

Through a number of middle-of-the-road positions, on issues such as grazing fees in the West and clean-up of the [[Everglades]], and through his support of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] in 1993 and the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] in 1994, Clinton dissatisfied some environmentalists. Specifically, the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] and its candidate [[Ralph Nader]] were outspoken in their criticism of Clinton's environmental record.\n\nDespite criticism from some environmental hardliners, the Clinton administration had several notable environmental accomplishments. Clinton created the President's Council on Sustainable Development, signed the [[Kyoto Protocol]]<ref>\"United States signs Kyoto Protocol on climate change\". Issues in Science and Technology. FindArticles.com. 08 Feb, 2011. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3622/is_199801/ai_n8763527/ /</ref> (although he did not [[Treaty Clause|submit the treaty]] to the Senate), and stood firm against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] attempts after the 1994 elections to roll back environmental laws and regulations through the appropriations process. During the Clinton administration, the EPA's budget was increased, and much of the country's natural resources were put under greater protection, such as the restoration of the Everglades and the increase in size of the [[Everglades National Park]]. Important [[U.S. Supreme Court]] cases from this period included [[United States v. Weitzenhoff]], et al.\n\n====The George W. Bush Administration (2001\u20132009)====\n{{see also|Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration#Environment}}\n\n=====The President\u2019s Initiative=====\nIn 2002 President [[George W. Bush]] announced an environment legislative initiative titled [[Clear Skies Act of 2003|Clear Skies]].<ref>{{cite web |title=President's Clear Skies Initiative Submitted to Congress |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/07/20020729-1.html |publisher=White House Archives |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref> The Clear Skies proposal's stated goals were to reduce three pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and mercury. Clear Skies was to use a market based system<ref>{{cite news|last=Marquis|first=Christopher|title=Bush Energy Proposal Seeks to 'Clear Skies' 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/30/politics/30AIR.html|accessdate=12 November 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 July 2012}}</ref> by allowing energy companies to buy and trade pollution credits. The president argued that since Clear Skies would use a market based system, millions of tons of pollution would be eliminated when compared to the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. However, the president's critics argued that the Clear Skies policy would weaken provisions in the Clean Air Act.<ref>{{cite web|last=Valtin |first=Tom |title=Bush Chips Away at Clean Air Act |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/planet/200302/clean_air_act.asp |publisher=The Sierra Club |accessdate=12 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029215307/http://www.sierraclub.org/planet/200302/clean_air_act.asp |archivedate=29 October 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"Vedantam\">{{cite news|last=Vedantam|title=Senate panel hangs dark cloud over Bush's \"Clear Skies\" plan.|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002202608_clearskies10.html|accessdate=November 12, 2011|work=The Seattle Times|date=10 March 2005}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe main provisions of the 1970 Clean Air Act were to control air pollution on a national level and an initiative program called [[New Source Review]] (NSR). The NSR initiative would require power plants to upgrade to anti-pollution technologies before they can expand existing facilities and add new technologies.<ref name=\"Vedantam\" /> The Clear Skies initiative proposed by the Bush administration main intention was to remove the New Source Review provision and deregulate some of the standards that the Clean Air Act required energy facilities to meet.<ref>Barcott, Bruce. \"Changing All the Rules.\" The New York Times April 2004.</ref> The proposed removal of the NSR prompted nine northeastern states to file suit in federal court to prevent the new ruling. Advocates against Clear Skies viewed the removal of NSR as a weakening of existing laws and an \u201cassault on the Clean Air Act\u201d. Environmental advocates and their political allies would eventually prevail in defeating the Clear Skies initiative.\n\n=====Global environmental policy=====\nPresident Bush refused to sign the [[Kyoto Protocol]], citing fears of negative consequences for the U.S. economy. Bush also cited that developing countries like [[India]] and [[China]] were exempt from Kyoto's requirements as a reason for his opposition.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sanger |first=David E. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/12/world/bush-will-continue-to-oppose-kyoto-pact-on-global-warming.html |title=Bush Will Continue to Oppose Kyoto Pact on Global Warming |work=The New York Times |date=2001-06-12}}</ref> When President Bush withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, many of his critics alleged that he made his decision on ideology rather than on science. Suzanne Goldenberg from the Guardian wrote the Bush years are seen \u201cas concerted assault, from the administration's undermining of the science\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |last=Goldenberg |first=Suzanne |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/16/greenpolitics-georgebush |title=The Worst of Times: Bush's Environmental Legacy Examined |work=The Guardian [London] |date=2009-01-16}}</ref> Bush's own [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] head [[Christine Todd Whitman]] said the decision to walk away from Kyoto was \"the equivalent to 'flipping the bird,' frankly, to the rest of the world\". Also, Eileen Claussen, president of the [[Pew Center on Global Climate Change]] said the idea of a head of state putting the science question on the table was horrifying. Bush's critics included Jonathon Dorm, [[Earth Policy Institute]] and [[NASA]] scientist [[James Hansen]]. Dorm contended that the administration made a \u201ccovert attempt to silence the science\u201d while Hansen alleged the administration was \u201ctrying to block data showing an acceleration in global warming\u201d.\n\nPresident Bush's refusal to seek ratification from the Senate was widely criticized by his opponents in the [[United States Congress]] and in the media. Some of President Bush's harshest critics claim his decision taken on the Kyoto Protocol was due to his close relationship with big oil companies. [[Greenpeace]] obtained briefing papers that revealed the administration thanked Exxon for their \u201cactive involvement\u201d on climate change. The Guardian reported documents revealed Under-secretary [[Paula Dobriansky]] \u201csound out Exxon executives and other anti-Kyoto business groups on potential alternatives to Kyoto\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |last=Vidal |first=John |title=Revealed: How Oil Giant Influenced Bush |work=The Guardian [London] |date=2005-06-08 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jun/08/usnews.climatechange}}</ref> However, in 2003, [[Exxon]] head of public affairs Nick Thomas denied taking any position on Kyoto.\n\n=====Campaign promise on the environment=====\nIn 2001, President Bush broke a campaign environment promise by reversing a promise he had made during his presidential campaign to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants. Governor Bush pledged power plants would have to meet clean-air standards while promising to enact tougher policies to protect the environment.<ref>Graham, John. \"[https://archive.org/details/bushonhomefrontd0000grah <!-- quote=environmental. --> Bush: On the Home Front].\" Graham, John. Cleaner Air, Warmer Climate. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2010. 194-196.</ref> The broken campaign promise was seen as a betrayal by environmental groups. The president's reversal on regulating carbon dioxide emissions was one of a series of controversial stands on environmental issues. For example, the Bush administration ruled that [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]] can claim they do not discharge animal waste to avoid oversight from the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].\n\n=====Environmental regulation=====\nThe actions taken during the Bush administration were seen by environmentalists as ideological rather than scientifically based. The criticism stemmed from the president's shifting views while he was a candidate for president and executive action taken as president. The Bush presidency was viewed as being weak on the environment due to ideology and close ties with big oil. However, Eli Lehrer from the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] contended that the Bush administration issued more regulations than any other administration in U.S. history.\n\n=====Reducing air pollution=====\nDuring President Bush's eight years in office he utilized his executive powers for a number of issues. In an effort to bypass NSR requirements, the president took executive action to \u201ccurb plant-by-plant permit reviews\u201d.<ref>Graham, John. \"Bush: On the Home Front.\" Graham, John. Cleaner Air, Warmer Climate. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2010. pg 201.</ref> He also ordered the EPA to develop a regional regulation using a market-based system. The EPA came-up with the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). CAIR was aimed at reducing 70 percent of pollution from coal burning plants. However, CAIR would later be struck down by U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 2008. Additionally, The Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) was also introduced. CAMR was created for the purpose of establishing a permanent national cap on mercury emissions.\n\n=====Bush environmental legacy=====\nIn the later years of the Bush administration, the president engaged in a series of environmental proposals. He called on countries with the largest greenhouse gases to establish a global goal to control emissions<ref>Fletcher, Michael and Juliet Eilperin. Bush Proposes Talks on Warming. 31 May 2007. 12 November 2011 <https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/31/AR2007053100934.html>.</ref> and in 2008 initiated the U.S to join the [[United Nations]] to negotiate a post-2012 global climate plan after Kyoto expires. The plan calls for inclusion of both developed and developing nations to address greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, during the later years, President Bush's position on climate changed. The president had taken steps in the later years of his presidency to address environmental criticism of his broken campaign promises, and argued that the Kyoto protocol was a plan to cripple the US economy. This stern position caused him serious credibility challenges on environmental issues both nationally and globally.\n\n====The Obama Administration (2009\u20132017)====\nEnvironmental issues were prominent in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]].

Within days of taking office he signed executive orders to approve two controversial oil pipelines and to require federal review of the Clean Water Rule and the [[Clean Power Plan]].

While the initial emphasis was on conventional air and water pollutants, which were the most obvious and easily measurable problems, newer issues are long-term problems that are not easily discernible and can be surrounded by controversy.\n\n===Acid deposition===\nAcid deposition, in the form of [[acid rain]] and dry deposition, is the result of [[sulfur dioxide|sulfur]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]] being emitted into the air, traveling and landing in a different place, and changing the acidity of the water or land on which the chemicals fall. Acid deposition in the Northeast United States from the burning of coal and in the West United States from utilities and motor vehicles caused [[Acid rain#Adverse effects|a number of problems]], and was partially exacerbated by the Clean Air Act, which forced [[fossil fuel power plant|coal power plants]] to use taller [[smoke stack]]s, resulting in farther transmission of sulfur dioxide in the air.\n\nDuring the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, the United States undertook a risk-averse policy, acting through the EPA and Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to research and control the pollutants suspected to cause acid deposition even in the face of scientific uncertainty. The Reagan administration was more risk tolerant. It argued that, given the scientific uncertainties about harm and exposure levels, new expenditures should not be undertaken that would curtail [[energy security]] and economic growth. During George H. W. Bush's presidential campaign, he called for new Clean Air Act legislation to curtail sulfur- and nitrogen-dioxide emissions. In 1990, after he was elected, amendments to the Clean Air Act were finally passed that cut emissions by over 12 million tons per year, set up a market-like system of emissions trading, and set a cap on emissions for the year 2000. These goals were achieved to some degree by the installation of industrial scrubbers.\n\nWhile the initial costs in cutting emissions levels were expected to be over $4.6 billion for utilities and a 40% rise in electricity costs, the impact ended up being only about $1 billion and a 2\u20134% rise in electricity costs. Part of the reason for the relatively low costs is the availability of low-sulfur [[coal]].\n\n===Ozone depletion===\n{{main|Climate change}}\n[[Ozone depletion]] is the reduced concentration of [[ozone]] in the Earth's [[stratosphere]] (called the ozone layer), where it serves to block much of the [[ultraviolet radiation]] from the [[sun]]. [[Chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs), which were used beginning in the 1930s in a number of important areas, were determined in 1974 to be responsible for much of the depletion of the ozone layer. Four years later, the EPA and [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] banned CFCs in aerosol cans. As research in the 1980s indicated that the problem was worse than before, and revealed a controversial massive hole in the ozone layer over [[Antarctica]], three international agreements were made to reduce the ozone-damaging substances- the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer|Vienna Convention]], the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], and a third agreement in 1990 in London. In the United States, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments phased out production of CFCs and required recycling of CFC products.\n\nAlthough the phase-out of CFCs took almost two decades, the policy is generally seen as a success. While a crisis seems to be averted, due to the longevity of CFC particles in the atmosphere, the ozone layer is only expected to start showing sign of recovery by 2024.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| journal = Geophysical Research Letters\n| volume= 33\n| issue= 12\n| pages = L12814\n| year= 2006\n| doi = 10.1029/2005GL025232\n| title = When will the Antarctic ozone hole recover?\n| author = Newman, P.

Following the events at [[Love Canal]], the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] (CERCLA, or Superfund) was enacted in 1980 to assist in the cleanup of abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites. In the mid-1980s, the [[Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments]] (1984) and the [[Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act]] (1986) were passed.\n\nThe aim of hazardous waste regulation is to prevent harm from occurring due to hazardous waste and to pass the burdens of cleanup of hazardous waste on to the original producers of the waste. Some of the problems of hazardous waste regulation are that the negative effects of hazardous waste can be difficult to detect and controversial and that, due mainly to the large amount of hazardous waste that is generated (214 million tons in 1995), regulation can be difficult and costly.\n\nImplementation has been difficult, with years sometimes passing between legislation passage and initial regulations. Superfund was passed in December 1980, just before Reagan took office. The first administrator of Superfund was [[Rita Lavelle]] who had worked for a major hazardous waste generator. The result was that her implementation of Superfund was designed mainly to delay regulation, and the subsequent controversy resulted in the resignation of Lavelle, EPA administrator [[Anne Burford]], and several other top EPA personnel. In 1986, Congress passed the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, increasing funding to $9 billion and providing for studies and new technologies. By 1995, Superfund cleanup still took an average of twelve years per site, and costs for each site can range in the billions of dollars. Superfund, while showing improvements, has been probably the most criticized of environmental programs based on costs of [[Environmental remediation|remediation]], implementation problems, and the questionable seriousness of the problems it addresses.\n\n===Risk control policy===\nUnderlying the policy decisions made by the United States is the concept of risk control, consisting of two parts: [[risk assessment]] and [[risk management]]. The science behind risk assessment varies greatly in uncertainty and tends to be the focus of political controversy. For example, [[animal testing]] is often used to determine the [[toxicity]] of various substances for humans. But assumptions made about expected dosage and exposure to chemicals are often disputed, and the dosage given to animals is typically much larger than what humans normally consume. While industry groups tend to take a risk-tolerant position, environmentalists take a risk-averse position, following the [[precautionary principle]].\n\nAnother issue is the effect that chemicals can have relative to lifestyle choices. [[Cancer]], for example, typically surface decades after first exposure to a [[carcinogen]], and lifestyle choices are frequently more important in causing cancer than exposure to chemicals. While the governmental role in mitigating lifestyle-choice risks can be very controversial (see [[Smoking in the United States]]), chemical exposure through lifestyle choices can also occur involuntarily if the public is not properly educated (see [[Endocrine disruptor]]s).\n\nFinally, the way that threats are presented to the public plays a large role in how those threats are addressed. The [[Nuclear safety in the United States|threat of nuclear power]] and the [[environmental effects of pesticides]] are overstated, some have claimed, while many high-priority threats go unpublicized. In order to combat this discrepancy, the EPA published a [[Relative Risk]] Report in 1987, and a follow-up report published by the Relative Risk Reduction Strategies Committee in 1990 suggested that the EPA should adopt a more pro-active posture, educating the public and assigning budgetary priorities for objectively assessed high-risk threats.\n\nRegulation of these policies are also very difficult to have implemented. The EPA is faced with many challenges when it comes to emplacing these standards. For a more conservative government less EPA action is allowed to be carried out and even more so now with the potential disbandment of the EPA (2018). The battles over environmental science, the EPA, and regulatory decision making in 2017, as well as over the past two decades, say much about the way Congress deals with environmental, energy, and natural resources issues today, and the many obstacles it will face in trying to chart new policy directions of the twenty-first century. The environmental gridlock that often slows the democratic process makes it very difficult for the EPA to pass the risk control policy that they hope to implement.\n\n==Impact==\nSince the major environmental legislation of the 1970s was enacted, great progress has been made in some areas, but the environmental protection has come at a high price. Between 1970 and 1996, air pollutants dropped 32% while the population grew by 29%. Other pollutants have been more difficult to track, especially water pollutants. While air and water standards have been slowly improving, in 1996 70 million people still lived in counties that did not meet EPA ozone standards. 36% of rivers and 39% of lakes did not meet minimum standards for all uses (swimming, fishing, drinking, supporting aquatic life). In the same period, the size of the [[National Park Service]] grew from {{convert|26000000|acre|km2}} to {{convert|83000000|acre|km2}}, and the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] expanded by over three times to manage over {{convert|92000000|acre|km2}}. In 1995, 41% of the 960 [[endangered species]] were stable or improving.\n\nCritics of environmental legislation argue that the gains made in environmental protection come at too great a cost. The overall cost of environmental regulation in the United States is estimated to be about 2% of the [[gross domestic product]]-similar to many other countries, but calculating the cost is challenging both conceptually (deciding what costs are included) and practically (with data from a broad range of sources).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pizer |first1=William A. |last2=Kopp |first2=Raymond J. |title=Calculating the Cost of Environmental Regulation |url=https://www.rff.org/publications/working-papers/calculating-the-cost-of-environmental-regulation |date=2003-02-28 |publisher=Resources for the Future |location=Washington, D.C. |id=Working Paper}}</ref> In 1994, almost $122 billion was spent on pollution abatement and control. $35 billion of that has been in direct government spending, $65 billion was spent by business, and $22 billion was spent by individuals.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Climate change policy of the United States]]\n* [[Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration#Climate change|Foreign policy of the Obama administration regarding Climate change]]\n* [[List of environmental agencies in the United States]]\n* [[List of United States federal environmental statutes]]\n* [[U.S. Climate Change Science Program]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Daynes, Byron W. and Glen Sussman.

The goal of [[environmental policy]] is to protect the environment for future generations while interfering as little as possible with the efficiency of commerce or the liberty of the people and to limit inequity in who is burdened with environmental costs. As his first official act bringing in the 1970s, President Richard Nixon signed the U.S. [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) into law on New Years Day, 1970. Also in the same year, America began celebrating [[Earth Day]], which has been called \"the big bang of U.S. environmental politics, launching the country on a sweeping social learning curve about ecological management never before experienced or attempted in any other nation.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Environmental Politics and Policy |last=Rosenbaum |first=Walter |edition=10th |publisher=CQ Press |year=2016 |isbn=9781506345376 |location= |page=9}}</ref> NEPA established a comprehensive US national environmental policy and created the requirement to prepare an environmental impact statement for \u201cmajor federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the environment.\u201d Author and consultant [[Charles H. Eccleston]] has called NEPA, the world's \u201cenvironmental Magna Carta\u201d.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eccleston |first=Charles H.|title=Global Environmental Policy: Concepts, Principles, and Practice |date=2010 |isbn=978-1439847664}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[environmental movement in the United States]], environmental policy continued to mature in the 1970s as several broad environmental laws were passed, regulating air and water pollution and forming the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA). Partially due to the high costs associated with these regulations, there has been a backlash from business and politically [[conservatism|conservative]] interests, limiting increases to environmental regulatory budgets and slowing efforts to protect the environment. Since the 1970s, despite frequent legislative gridlock, there have been significant achievements in environmental regulation, including increases in air and water quality and, to a lesser degree, control of [[hazardous waste]]. Due to increasing [[scientific consensus on global warming]] and political pressure from environmental groups, modifications to the [[Energy policy of the United States|United States energy policy]] and limits on [[greenhouse gas]] have been suggested.\n\nAs established under NEPA, the US was the first nation in the world to introduce the concept of preparing an [[environmental impact statement]] (EIS) to evaluate the alternatives and impacts of proposed federal actions.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Eccleston |first=Charles H. |title=The EIS Book: Managing and Preparing Environmental Impact Statements |date=2010 |publisher=CRC Press |pages=}}</ref> The EIS process is designed to forge federal policies, programs, projects, and plans.<ref>U.S. Council on Environmental Quality. ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|40|1500}}</ref> A large percentage of nations around the world have adopted provisions that emulate the American EIS process.\n\n==Policy tools==\n[[File:An example of US Federal Environmental Regulations, 1987.jpg|thumb|right|[[Federal Register]] documents and literature related to US environmental regulations, including the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA), 1987]]\nThe two major policy tools for protecting the environment are rules and inducements. The United States has chosen to use rules, primarily through regulation. Such regulations can come in the form of design standards and [[Emission standard|performance standards]]. Performance standards specify emission levels and let those covered by the rules decide how those levels will be met. Design standards specify exactly how performance standards will be met.\n\nAlternatively, the government can use inducements, or \"market reform\". Inducements are rewards and punishments used to influence people or groups. The two major types of market reforms are charge systems, such as [[Ecotax|emissions taxes]], and \"[[Emissions trading|tradable permit systems]]\". One type of tradable permit system is an \"auction of pollution rights\" in which the amount of allowed pollution is set and divided into units, which are then auctioned, giving environmental organizations the opportunity to buy the units to create a cleaner environment than originally planned. Such a plan was implemented for SO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the 1990 [[Acid Rain Program]] and has been undertaken for greenhouse gases on a regional scale as a way to [[mitigation of global warming|mitigate global warming]].\n\n==Power delegation and policy jurisdiction==\n\n===Executive branch===\nGovernmental authority on [[environmental issues in the United States]] is highly fragmented. While the EPA is the most comprehensive environmental agency, its authority on these matters is not absolute. Virtually all of the [[United States federal executive departments|executive branch's departments]] have some area of environmental authority. This contributes somewhat to the cost and questionable efficacy of the United States' environmental regulation.\n\nAs chief execute, the President plays an important role in environmental policy. President's such as Teddy Roosevelt, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Richard Nixon]] have acted as \"bully pulpit\" to gain support for environmental legislation. Their role as chief diplomat enables them to enact international agreements with environmental stipulations. Ronald Reagan signed the Montreal Protocol, Obama was a leader in negotiating the Paris agreement and the Bush administration rejected the Kyoto protocol. Presidents can use their \"soft\" power to draw attention to environmental issues and set broad administrative goals. They can veto legislation and, through executive orders, regulate administrative behavior.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vig |first1=Norman |last2=Kraft |first2=Michael |title=Environmental Policy |date=2019 |publisher=Sage |pages=88\u2013109}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|'''Federal Agency'''||'''Environmental Responsibilities'''\n|-\n|[[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House Office]]||Overall policy, Agency coordination\n|-\n|[[Office of Management and Budget]]||Budget, Agency coordination and management\n|-\n|[[Council on Environmental Quality]]||Environmental policy, Agency coordination, [[Environmental impact statement]]s\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]]||Health\n|-\n|[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]||Air and water pollution, Solid waste, Radiation, Pesticides, Noise, Toxic substances\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]||Environmental litigation\n|-\n|[[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]]||Public lands, Energy, Minerals, National parks\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]]||Forestry, Soil, Conservation\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]||Civil works construction, [[Clean Water Act#Dredge and fill permits (wetlands)|Dredge and fill permits]], Pollution control from defense facilities\n|-\n|[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]||License and regulate [[Nuclear power in the United States|nuclear power]]\n|-\n|[[United States Department of State|Department of State]]||International environment\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]]||Oceanic and atmospheric monitoring and research\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]]||Occupational health\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]]||Housing, Urban parks, Urban planning\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]]||[[Public transport|Mass transit]], Roads, [[Aircraft noise]], Oil pollution\n|-\n|[[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]||Energy policy coordination, Petroleum allocation research and development\n|-\n|[[Tennessee Valley Authority]]||Electric power generation\n|-\n|[[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]||Cleaning up the natural disasters caused by climate change\n|-\n|[[Department of Homeland Security]]|[[United States Coast Guard]]||Maritime and environmental stewardship, National Pollution Funds Center (NPFC)\n|}\n\n===Legislative branch===\nFragmentation within the executive branch is duplicated in Congress and within the states.  In other words, congress shares authority with the president for environmental federal policy.  Congress can have a major impact on policy through legislative and oversight hearings.  They also have the ability to influence policy by publishing studies and reports, making speeches and introducing legislation. The EPA is the concern of almost two-thirds of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]' standing committees and subcommittees and a similar percentage in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Some seventy committees and subcommittees control water quality policy, for example. Such fragmentation creates both opportunities and problems. While such a variety of committees provide enormous access for environmentalist and industry groups to lobby, the division of tasks means that no one committee or agency looks at environmental problems as a whole.  Building policy consensus in Congress is rarely easy because of the diversity of interests and of members whose concerns need to be met.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Senate

more environmental laws in the United States, both at the federal and [[U.S. state|state]] levels. The [[common law]] of [[property]] and [[takings]] also play an important role in environmental issues. In addition, the law of [[standing (law)|standing]], relating to who has a right to bring a lawsuit, is an important issue in environmental law in the United States.\n\n===Origins of the environmental movement===\n{{Main|Environmental movement in the United States}}\nThe history of environmental law in the United States can be traced back to early roots in [[common law]] doctrines, for example, the law of [[nuisance]] and the [[public trust doctrine]]. The first statutory environmental law was the [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899]], which has been largely superseded by the Clean Water Act. However, most current major environmental statutes, such as the federal statutes listed above, were passed during the modern environmental movement spanning the late 1960s through the early 1980s. Prior to the passage of these statutes, most federal environmental laws were not nearly as comprehensive.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe precursor of the modern environmental movement in the United States was the early 20th century [[conservation movement]], associated with President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Gifford Pinchot]]. During this period, the [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] was formed and public concern for consumer protection began, epitomized by the publication of ''[[The Jungle]]'' by [[Upton Sinclair]]. The modern environmental movement was inspired in part by the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s controversial 1962 book ''[[Silent Spring]]'', which pointed out the perils of pesticide use and rallied concern for the environment in general. Carson argued that nature deserved human protection and referred to pesticides as the atomic bomb for insects. She stated that these pesticides would cycle through the environment hurting humans and nature and thought they should be used wisely. Carson played a big role in environment activism that was later to come.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |title=The World Transformed: 1945 to the present |last=Hunt |first=Michael |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-19-937102-0 |location=New York |pages=215\u2013216}}</ref> Along with critiques of the misuse of technology from figures such as [[William Ophuls]], [[Barry Commoner]] and [[Garrett Hardin]], the ineffectiveness and criticism of the 1960s-era Clean Air and Clean Water acts gave a burgeoning momentum to the environmental movement.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dye |first=Thomas |title=Understanding Public Policy |year=2011 |publisher=Longman |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-75742-8 |page=227}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to growing public support, structural changes such as Congressional reform and new access to the courts gave environmentalists new power to enact change. The movement that formed held three key values: [[Social ecology (theory)|ecology]], health, and [[sustainability]]. These values\u2014that we depend and are interconnected with the environment, that insults to the environment can affect our health, and that we should limit our dependence on non-renewable resources\u2014along with a uniquely sympathetic president and Congress, led to great environmental policy change in the 1970s. In 1972 the Club of Rome report came out which was a scholarly effort to gauge the severity of the environmental problem.  A team of researchers concluded with one of the most alarming appraisals of the time and set off widespread debates over the findings, its methods, and policy implications. The model was built mainly to investigate major trends of global concerns such as accelerating industrialization, rapid population growth, widespread malnutrition, depletion of nonrenewable resources and a deteriorating environment. They concluded that if the present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion remains unchanged than the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOne lawsuit that has been widely recognized as one of the earliest environmental cases is ''Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v.

Later in the year, Nixon created the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), which consolidated environmental programs from other agencies into a single entity. The legislation during this period concerned primarily first-generation pollutants in the air, surface water, groundwater, and solid waste disposal. Air pollutants such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], and [[ozone]] were put under regulation, and issues such as [[acid rain]], [[visibility]], and [[global warming]] were also concerns. In surface water, the pollutants of concern were [[conventional pollutant]]s ([[bacteria]], [[biochemical oxygen demand]] and [[total suspended solids|suspended solids]]), dissolved solids, nutrients, and toxic substances such as metals and pesticides. For groundwater, the pollutants included biological contaminants, inorganic and organic substances, and [[radionuclide]]s. Finally, solid waste contaminants from agriculture, industry, mining, municipalities, and other sectors were put under control.\n\nThe Clean Air Act amendments of 1970 (CAA) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments of 1972 (Clean Water Act) moved environmental concerns in a new direction.\n\nThe new CAA standards that were to be promulgated were unattainable with existing technology\u2014they were technology-forcing. The standards that the EPA put into place called mainly for state implementation. Each state prepared state implementation plans (SIPs), requiring EPA approval. The 1970 CAA also established deadlines and penalties for automobile emission standards in new cars, resulting in the development and adoption of [[catalytic converter]]s and greatly reducing automobile pollution.\n\nFor wastewater, each discharging facility was required to obtain a permit, and EPA began to issue new federal standards (\"[[effluent guidelines]]\") that required industries to use the \"[[best available technology]]\" for treating their wastes. Congress also established a massive public works program to assist in the construction of [[sewage treatment]] plants for municipalities, and most plants were required to meet [[secondary treatment]] standards.\n\nPolitical scientists Byron Daines and Glenn Sussman have evaluated all the presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to George W. Bush on their environmentalism. in their judgment,  all the Democrats are evaluated as having a positive impact on the environment, along with one Republican: Nixon. Capital the other five Republicans had a mixed impact (Eisenhower, Ford and George H.W. Bush), or negative impacts (Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush).<ref>Byron Daines and Glenn Sussman , ''White House politics and the Environment'' (2010) page v.</ref> Daines and Sussman conclude their analysis by identifying six major achievements for which they give credit to Nixon.<ref>Daines and Sussman , ''White House politics and the Environment'' (2010) pages 82-83, summarizing their review of Nixon on pages 66-83.</ref>\n*He broadened the attention span of the Republican Party to include environmental issues, for the first time since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. He thereby \"dislodged the Democratic Party from its position of dominance over the environment.\"\n* He used presidential powers, and promoted legislation in Congress to create a permanent political structure, most notably the Environmental Protection Agency, the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and others.\n* He helped ensure that Congress build a permanent structure supportive of environmentalism, especially the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, which enjoined all federal agencies to help protect the environment.\n* Nixon appointed a series of strong environmentalists in two highly visible positions{{which|date=October 2019}} including [[William Ruckelshaus]], [[Russell Train]], [[Russell W. Peterson]], and John C. Whitaker (who was a senior White House aide for four years, becoming Undersecretary of the Interior in 1973).\n* Nixon initiated worldwide diplomatic attention to environmental issues, working especially with [[NATO]].\n* Finally, they assert: \"Nixon did not have to be personally committed to the environment to become one of the most successful presidents in promoting environmental priorities.\"<ref>Daines and Sussman , ''White House politics and the Environment'' (2010) pp 82-83.</ref>\n\n====The Ford Administration (1974-1977)====\nEnvironmentalism was a peripheral issue during the short administration of [[Presidency of Gerald Ford|Gerald Ford, 1974-1977.]] His primary concern was a stable economy, and environmental issues were sacrificed against policies for economic growth. Environmentalists left over from the Nixon days, such as EPA head Russell Train were frustrated, while opponents of environmentalism such as [[Thomas S. Kleppe]]. As Secretary of the Interior, Kleppe was a leader of the \u201c[[Sagebrush Rebellion]]\u201d in which Western ranchers had the support of state government in 15 Western states who passed laws and launched litigation to try to nullify federal environmental protections that interfered with their business. They lost repeatedly in the federal courts, most notably in the Supreme Court decision in [[Kleppe v. New Mexico]] (1976).<ref>Robert L. Fischman and Jeremiah I. Williamson. \"The Story of Kleppe v. New Mexico: The Sagebrush Rebellion as Un-Cooperative Federalism.\" ''University of Colorado Law Review'' 83 (2011): 123+ [https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1454&context=facpub online]</ref>\n\nFord\u2019s successes included the addition of two national monuments six historical sites, three historic parks and two national preserves. None were controversial. He signed the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (1974) and the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (1976), two of the landmark laws approved in the \"environmental decade.\" In the international field, agreements with Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, the Soviet Union and several European countries included provisions to protect endangered species. Ford narrowly defeated Ronald Reagan for renomination in 1976, when environmental issues were not at issue.

Carter's weakness was exhibited in his 1977 decision to eliminate funding for 19 water resource construction projects, despite strong objections from congressmen who favored the programs. Carter distrusted the programs, based on his own troubled gubernatorial experience with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], his campaign rhetoric and the rhetoric of his environmentalist supporters, compounded by his lack of experience with Congress. He was forced to retreat, and lost much of his influence on Capitol Hill. Democrats in Congress were displeased with his moralistic, executive-oriented, rational approach to decision-making and his reluctance adjustment to go along with standard congressional methods of compromise, patronage, and [[logrolling]].<ref>Paul E.

Americans had become alarmingly dependent on imported oil, purchasing about a fourth of all the [[OPEC]] production. American consumption per capita was more than double that of Europe or Japan. Carter's goal was to reverse this dependence. He supported the 1977 laws creating the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], and the Emergency Natural Gas Act, and created the [[Synthetic Fuels Corporation]], funded with $20 billion for joint ventures with the private sector.<ref>Robert A.

He convinced Carter to withdraw nearly half of 375 million acres of public domain land from commercial use in a series of executive moves and new laws. In December 1978 the President placed more 56 million acres of the state's federal lands into the [[National Park Service#National Park System|National Park System]], protecting them from mineral or oil development. The 1980 [[Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act]] doubled the amount of public land set aside for national parks and wildlife refuges. Carter used his power under the 1906 [[Antiquities Act]] to set aside 57 million acres in 17 national monuments. The remaining acres were withdrawn under the [[Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976]].<ref>Stephen W.

As Reagan entered office, he was given two transition reports. One report was \"[[Mandate for Leadership]]\" from the [[Heritage Foundation]] and the other was \"Avoiding a GOP Economic Dunkirk\" from conservative Congressman [[David Stockman]](R-MI). Each report called for drastic changes in environmental regulation, primarily through administrative changes. In pursuit of this strategy, Reagan gradually reduced the EPA's budget by 30% through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, cut the number of EPA employees, and appointed people at key agency positions who would enthusiastically follow the administration line. Appointees such as [[Anne Burford]] at the EPA and [[James G. Watt]] at the Department of the Interior were overtly hostile to environmental protection. Through his appointments, Reagan changed the operations of environmental protection from stiff regulation to \"cooperative regulation.\" (Burford and most of her Assistant Administrators were forced to resign in 1983 due to scandals involving their mismanagement of Superfund and other EPA programs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-Official of E.P.A. Indicted Over Dispute With Congress |url=https://nyti.ms/29JLF6v |date=1983-05-28 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>)\n\nUnder this administrative strategy of regulatory relief, environmental laws were written and interpreted more favorably for industry interests. The [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) was also given new powers to write regulations. During the first Reagan administration, the OMB was given the power to require a favorable cost-benefit analysis of any regulation before it could be implemented. This was used to delay new regulations, and changes that resulted in regulatory relief often had this requirement waived. At the beginning of the second Reagan administration, the OMB was given more power. All regulatory agencies were required to submit proposals each year for all major environmental regulation, which allowed OMB to reduce regulatory efforts before such proposed regulations became public.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book |title=The Republican reversal: conservatives and the environment from Nixon to Trump |last=Turner |first=James Morton |last2=Isenberg |first2=Andrew C. |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2018 |isbn=9780674979970 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |pages=102\u2013110 |oclc=1023100262}}</ref>\n\nWithin few months from entering the White House, Reagan removed the solar panels that his predecessor Carter had installed on the roof of the White House\u2019s West Wing. \"Reagan's political philosophy viewed the free market as the best arbiter of what was good for the country.

W. Bush Administration (1989\u20131993)====\nEnvironmental policy during the first Bush administration contained a mixture of innovation and restriction. [[George H. W. Bush]] appointed an environmentalist, [[William Reilly]], to head the EPA, along with others with strong environmental inclinations. Before accepting the appointment, Reilly secured the President\u2019s agreement to support his pro-environment agenda and his access to the White House, but competing interests ensured conflicts.<ref>EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator William K.

Sununu]], [[Richard Darman]], and [[Dan Quayle]]. While considerable regulation was initially passed, during his last two years in office he severely restricted regulation, and in 1992, a total freeze was put on new regulations.\n\nOn July 21, 1989, Bush sent a bill to Congress proposing amendments to the Clean Air Act.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Vig and Kraft, ''Environmental Policy.''</ref> The core of the amendments were meant to reduce acid rain by limiting sulfur dioxide emissions from coal burning plants, to bring eighty urban areas up to current air quality standards and to lower emissions from over two- hundred airborne toxic chemicals.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Bush supported a [[cap-and-trade]] system to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, a strategy which allowed utilities flexibility in meeting the laws goal.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The final version of the bill included new regulatory programs for control of acid rain and for the issuance of stationary source operating permits, and expansion of the regulatory program for toxic air emissions.<ref>The formal name for the air toxics program is [[National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants]] (NESHAP).</ref> Congress passed the bill with large majorities in both houses,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://environmentamerica.org/blogs/environment-america-blog/ame/lessons-bipartisanship-1990-clean-air-act-amendments |title=Lessons in bipartisanship: the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments |last=Madsen |first=Travis |date=2017-11-15 |publisher=Environment America |location=Denver, CO}}</ref> and Bush signed the bill on November 15, 1990.<ref>United States.

While previous regulatory-relief efforts, such as Reagan's use of OMB, were subject to [[Congressional oversight]], the Council on Competitiveness was independent and was not required to keep records of its proceedings. The Council on Competitiveness received its authority from a White House memoranda and its members included Vice President Dan Quayle, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Duffy |first1=Robert J. |date=1996 |title=Divided Government and Institutional Combat: The Case of the Quayle Council on Competitiveness |url= |journal=Polity |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=379\u2013399 |doi=10.2307/3235378 |jstor=3235378}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Bush opposed international efforts at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]] by refusing to sign the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|biodiversity treaty]] and lobbying to remove all binding targets from the proposal on limiting [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|global carbon dioxide emissions]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Greenhouse |first=Steven |date=1992-06-14 |title=A Closer Look: Ecology, the Economy, and Bush |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D81E3CF937A25755C0A964958260 |work=New York Times}}</ref>\n\n====The Clinton Administration (1993\u20132001)====\nThe [[Bill Clinton administration]] promised a change in the direction of environmental policy. [[Al Gore]], the Vice President, and appointees such as [[Carol Browner]] at EPA and [[Bruce Babbitt]] at Interior were all encouraging from an environmental standpoint. Clinton eliminated the Council on Competitiveness, returning regulatory authority to agency heads, and Clinton and Gore argued that environmental protection and economic growth were not incompatible.<ref>Paul Rauber \"Does he deserve your vote? \u2013 Bill Clinton's environmental record\".

Through a number of middle-of-the-road positions, on issues such as grazing fees in the West and clean-up of the [[Everglades]], and through his support of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] in 1993 and the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] in 1994, Clinton dissatisfied some environmentalists. Specifically, the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] and its candidate [[Ralph Nader]] were outspoken in their criticism of Clinton's environmental record.\n\nDespite criticism from some environmental hardliners, the Clinton administration had several notable environmental accomplishments. Clinton created the President's Council on Sustainable Development, signed the [[Kyoto Protocol]]<ref>\"United States signs Kyoto Protocol on climate change\". Issues in Science and Technology. FindArticles.com. 08 Feb, 2011. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3622/is_199801/ai_n8763527/ /</ref> (although he did not [[Treaty Clause|submit the treaty]] to the Senate), and stood firm against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] attempts after the 1994 elections to roll back environmental laws and regulations through the appropriations process. During the Clinton administration, the EPA's budget was increased, and much of the country's natural resources were put under greater protection, such as the restoration of the Everglades and the increase in size of the [[Everglades National Park]]. Important [[U.S. Supreme Court]] cases from this period included [[United States v. Weitzenhoff]], et al.\n\n====The George W.

Clear Skies was to use a market based system<ref>{{cite news|last=Marquis|first=Christopher|title=Bush Energy Proposal Seeks to 'Clear Skies' 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/30/politics/30AIR.html|accessdate=12 November 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 July 2012}}</ref> by allowing energy companies to buy and trade pollution credits. The president argued that since Clear Skies would use a market based system, millions of tons of pollution would be eliminated when compared to the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. However, the president\u2019s critics argued that the Clear Skies policy would weaken provisions in the Clean Air Act.<ref>{{cite web|last=Valtin |first=Tom |title=Bush Chips Away at Clean Air Act |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/planet/200302/clean_air_act.asp |publisher=The Sierra Club |accessdate=12 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029215307/http://www.sierraclub.org/planet/200302/clean_air_act.asp |archivedate=29 October 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"Vedantam\">{{cite news|last=Vedantam|title=Senate panel hangs dark cloud over Bush's \"Clear Skies\" plan.|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002202608_clearskies10.html|accessdate=November 12, 2011|work=The Seattle Times|date=10 March 2005}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe main provisions of the 1970 Clean Air Act were to control air pollution on a national level and an initiative program called [[New Source Review]] (NSR). The NSR initiative would require power plants to upgrade to anti-pollution technologies before they can expand existing facilities and add new technologies.<ref name=\"Vedantam\" /> The Clear Skies initiative proposed by the Bush administration main intention was to remove the New Source Review provision and deregulate some of the standards that the Clean Air Act required energy facilities to meet.<ref>Barcott, Bruce. \"Changing All the Rules.\" The New York Times April 2004.</ref> The proposed removal of the NSR prompted nine northeastern states to file suit in federal court to prevent the new ruling. Advocates against Clear Skies viewed the removal of NSR as a weakening of existing laws and an \u201cassault on the Clean Air Act\u201d. Environmental advocates and their political allies would eventually prevail in defeating the Clear Skies initiative.\n\n=====Global environmental policy=====\nPresident Bush refused to sign the [[Kyoto Protocol]], citing fears of negative consequences for the U.S. economy. Bush also cited that developing countries like [[India]] and [[China]] were exempt from Kyoto's requirements as a reason for his opposition.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sanger |first=David E. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/12/world/bush-will-continue-to-oppose-kyoto-pact-on-global-warming.html |title=Bush Will Continue to Oppose Kyoto Pact on Global Warming |work=The New York Times |date=2001-06-12}}</ref> When President Bush withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, many of his critics alleged that he made his decision on ideology rather than on science. Suzanne Goldenberg from the Guardian wrote the Bush years are seen \u201cas concerted assault, from the administration's undermining of the science\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |last=Goldenberg |first=Suzanne |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/16/greenpolitics-georgebush |title=The Worst of Times: Bush's Environmental Legacy Examined |work=The Guardian [London] |date=2009-01-16}}</ref> Bush\u2019s own [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] head [[Christine Todd Whitman]] said the decision to walk away from Kyoto was \"the equivalent to 'flipping the bird,' frankly, to the rest of the world\". Also, Eileen Claussen, president of the [[Pew Center on Global Climate Change]] said the idea of a head of state putting the science question on the table was horrifying. Bush\u2019s critics included Jonathon Dorm, [[Earth Policy Institute]] and [[NASA]] scientist [[James Hansen]]. Dorm contended that the administration made a \u201ccovert attempt to silence the science\u201d while Hansen alleged the administration was \u201ctrying to block data showing an acceleration in global warming\u201d.\n\nPresident Bush\u2019s refusal to seek ratification from the Senate was widely criticized by his opponents in the [[United States Congress]] and in the media. Some of President Bush\u2019s harshest critics claim his decision taken on the Kyoto Protocol was due to his close relationship with big oil companies. [[Greenpeace]] obtained briefing papers that revealed the administration thanked Exxon for their \u201cactive involvement\u201d on climate change. The Guardian reported documents revealed Under-secretary [[Paula Dobriansky]] \u201csound out Exxon executives and other anti-Kyoto business groups on potential alternatives to Kyoto\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |last=Vidal |first=John |title=Revealed: How Oil Giant Influenced Bush |work=The Guardian [London] |date=2005-06-08 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jun/08/usnews.climatechange}}</ref> However, in 2003, [[Exxon]] head of public affairs Nick Thomas denied taking any position on Kyoto.\n\n=====Campaign promise on the environment=====\nIn 2001, President Bush broke a campaign environment promise by reversing a promise he had made during his presidential campaign to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants. Governor Bush pledged power plants would have to meet clean-air standards while promising to enact tougher policies to protect the environment.<ref>Graham, John. \"[https://archive.org/details/bushonhomefrontd0000grah <!-- quote=environmental. --> Bush: On the Home Front].\" Graham, John. Cleaner Air, Warmer Climate. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2010. 194-196.</ref> The broken campaign promise was seen as a betrayal by environmental groups. The president\u2019s reversal on regulating carbon dioxide emissions was one of a series of controversial stands on environmental issues. For example, the Bush administration ruled that [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]] can claim they do not discharge animal waste to avoid oversight from the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].\n\n=====Environmental regulation=====\nThe actions taken during the Bush administration were seen by environmentalists as ideological rather than scientifically based. The criticism stemmed from the president\u2019s shifting views while he was a candidate for president and executive action taken as president. The Bush presidency was viewed as being weak on the environment due to ideology and close ties with big oil. However, Eli Lehrer from the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] contended that the Bush administration issued more regulations than any other administration in U.S. history.\n\n=====Reducing air pollution=====\nDuring President Bush\u2019s eight years in office he utilized his executive powers for a number of issues. In an effort to bypass NSR requirements, the president took executive action to \u201ccurb plant-by-plant permit reviews\u201d.<ref>Graham, John. \"Bush: On the Home Front.\" Graham, John. Cleaner Air, Warmer Climate. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2010. pg 201.</ref> He also ordered the EPA to develop a regional regulation using a market-based system. The EPA came-up with the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). CAIR was aimed at reducing 70 percent of pollution from coal burning plants. However, CAIR would later be struck down by U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 2008. Additionally, The Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) was also introduced. CAMR was created for the purpose of establishing a permanent national cap on mercury emissions.\n\n=====Bush environmental legacy=====\nIn the later years of the Bush administration, the president engaged in a series of environmental proposals. He called on countries with the largest greenhouse gases to establish a global goal to control emissions<ref>Fletcher, Michael and Juliet Eilperin. Bush Proposes Talks on Warming. 31 May 2007. 12 November 2011 <https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/31/AR2007053100934.html>.</ref> and in 2008 initiated the U.S to join the [[United Nations]] to negotiate a post-2012 global climate plan after Kyoto expires. The plan calls for inclusion of both developed and developing nations to address greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, during the later years, President Bush\u2019s position on climate changed. The president had taken steps in the later years of his presidency to address environmental criticism of his broken campaign promises, and argued that the Kyoto protocol was a plan to cripple the US economy. This stern position caused him serious credibility challenges on environmental issues both nationally and globally.\n\n====The Obama Administration (2009\u20132017)====\nEnvironmental issues were prominent in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]].

Within days of taking office he signed executive orders to approve two controversial oil pipelines and to require federal review of the Clean Water Rule and the [[Clean Power Plan]].

While the initial emphasis was on conventional air and water pollutants, which were the most obvious and easily measurable problems, newer issues are long-term problems that are not easily discernible and can be surrounded by controversy.\n\n===Acid deposition===\nAcid deposition, in the form of [[acid rain]] and dry deposition, is the result of [[sulfur dioxide|sulfur]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]] being emitted into the air, traveling and landing in a different place, and changing the acidity of the water or land on which the chemicals fall. Acid deposition in the Northeast United States from the burning of coal and in the West United States from utilities and motor vehicles caused [[Acid rain#Adverse effects|a number of problems]], and was partially exacerbated by the Clean Air Act, which forced [[fossil fuel power plant|coal power plants]] to use taller [[smoke stack]]s, resulting in farther transmission of sulfur dioxide in the air.\n\nDuring the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, the United States undertook a risk-averse policy, acting through the EPA and Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to research and control the pollutants suspected to cause acid deposition even in the face of scientific uncertainty. The Reagan administration was more risk tolerant. It argued that, given the scientific uncertainties about harm and exposure levels, new expenditures should not be undertaken that would curtail [[energy security]] and economic growth. During George H. W. Bush's presidential campaign, he called for new Clean Air Act legislation to curtail sulfur- and nitrogen-dioxide emissions. In 1990, after he was elected, amendments to the Clean Air Act were finally passed that cut emissions by over 12 million tons per year, set up a market-like system of emissions trading, and set a cap on emissions for the year 2000. These goals were achieved to some degree by the installation of industrial scrubbers.\n\nWhile the initial costs in cutting emissions levels were expected to be over $4.6 billion for utilities and a 40% rise in electricity costs, the impact ended up being only about $1 billion and a 2\u20134% rise in electricity costs. Part of the reason for the relatively low costs is the availability of low-sulfur [[coal]].\n\n===Ozone depletion===\n{{main|Climate change}}\n[[Ozone depletion]] is the reduced concentration of [[ozone]] in the Earth's [[stratosphere]] (called the ozone layer), where it serves to block much of the [[ultraviolet radiation]] from the [[sun]]. [[Chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs), which were used beginning in the 1930s in a number of important areas, were determined in 1974 to be responsible for much of the depletion of the ozone layer. Four years later, the EPA and [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] banned CFCs in aerosol cans. As research in the 1980s indicated that the problem was worse than before, and revealed a controversial massive hole in the ozone layer over [[Antarctica]], three international agreements were made to reduce the ozone-damaging substances- the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer|Vienna Convention]], the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], and a third agreement in 1990 in London. In the United States, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments phased out production of CFCs and required recycling of CFC products.\n\nAlthough the phase-out of CFCs took almost two decades, the policy is generally seen as a success. While a crisis seems to be averted, due to the longevity of CFC particles in the atmosphere, the ozone layer is only expected to start showing sign of recovery by 2024.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| journal = Geophysical Research Letters\n| volume= 33\n| issue= 12\n| pages = L12814\n| year= 2006\n| doi = 10.1029/2005GL025232\n| title = When will the Antarctic ozone hole recover?\n| author = Newman, P.

Following the events at [[Love Canal]], the [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] (CERCLA, or Superfund) was enacted in 1980 to assist in the cleanup of abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites. In the mid-1980s, the [[Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments]] (1984) and the [[Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act]] (1986) were passed.\n\nThe aim of hazardous waste regulation is to prevent harm from occurring due to hazardous waste and to pass the burdens of cleanup of hazardous waste on to the original producers of the waste. Some of the problems of hazardous waste regulation are that the negative effects of hazardous waste can be difficult to detect and controversial and that, due mainly to the large amount of hazardous waste that is generated (214 million tons in 1995), regulation can be difficult and costly.\n\nImplementation has been difficult, with years sometimes passing between legislation passage and initial regulations. Superfund was passed in December 1980, just before Reagan took office. The first administrator of Superfund was [[Rita Lavelle]] who had worked for a major hazardous waste generator. The result was that her implementation of Superfund was designed mainly to delay regulation, and the subsequent controversy resulted in the resignation of Lavelle, EPA administrator [[Anne Burford]], and several other top EPA personnel. In 1986, Congress passed the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, increasing funding to $9 billion and providing for studies and new technologies. By 1995, Superfund cleanup still took an average of twelve years per site, and costs for each site can range in the billions of dollars. Superfund, while showing improvements, has been probably the most criticized of environmental programs based on costs of [[Environmental remediation|remediation]], implementation problems, and the questionable seriousness of the problems it addresses.\n\n===Risk control policy===\nUnderlying the policy decisions made by the United States is the concept of risk control, consisting of two parts: [[risk assessment]] and [[risk management]]. The science behind risk assessment varies greatly in uncertainty and tends to be the focus of political controversy. For example, [[animal testing]] is often used to determine the [[toxicity]] of various substances for humans. But assumptions made about expected dosage and exposure to chemicals are often disputed, and the dosage given to animals is typically much larger than what humans normally consume. While industry groups tend to take a risk-tolerant position, environmentalists take a risk-averse position, following the [[precautionary principle]].\n\nAnother issue is the effect that chemicals can have relative to lifestyle choices. [[Cancer]], for example, typically surface decades after first exposure to a [[carcinogen]], and lifestyle choices are frequently more important in causing cancer than exposure to chemicals. While the governmental role in mitigating lifestyle-choice risks can be very controversial (see [[Smoking in the United States]]), chemical exposure through lifestyle choices can also occur involuntarily if the public is not properly educated (see [[Endocrine disruptor]]s).\n\nFinally, the way that threats are presented to the public plays a large role in how those threats are addressed. The [[Nuclear safety in the United States|threat of nuclear power]] and the [[environmental effects of pesticides]] are overstated, some have claimed, while many high-priority threats go unpublicized. In order to combat this discrepancy, the EPA published a [[Relative Risk]] Report in 1987, and a follow-up report published by the Relative Risk Reduction Strategies Committee in 1990 suggested that the EPA should adopt a more pro-active posture, educating the public and assigning budgetary priorities for objectively assessed high-risk threats.\n\nRegulation of these policies are also very difficult to have implemented. The EPA is faced with many challenges when it comes to emplacing these standards. For a more conservative government less EPA action is allowed to be carried out and even more so now with the potential disbandment of the EPA (2018). The battles over environmental science, the EPA, and regulatory decision making in 2017, as well as over the past two decades, say much about the way Congress deals with environmental, energy, and natural resources issues today, and the many obstacles it will face in trying to chart new policy directions of the twenty-first century. The environmental gridlock that often slows the democratic process makes it very difficult for the EPA to pass the risk control policy that they hope to implement.\n\n==Impact==\nSince the major environmental legislation of the 1970s was enacted, great progress has been made in some areas, but the environmental protection has come at a high price. Between 1970 and 1996, air pollutants dropped 32% while the population grew by 29%. Other pollutants have been more difficult to track, especially water pollutants. While air and water standards have been slowly improving, in 1996 70 million people still lived in counties that did not meet EPA ozone standards. 36% of rivers and 39% of lakes did not meet minimum standards for all uses (swimming, fishing, drinking, supporting aquatic life). In the same period, the size of the [[National Park Service]] grew from {{convert|26000000|acre|km2}} to {{convert|83000000|acre|km2}}, and the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] expanded by over three times to manage over {{convert|92000000|acre|km2}}. In 1995, 41% of the 960 [[endangered species]] were stable or improving.\n\nCritics of environmental legislation argue that the gains made in environmental protection come at too great a cost. The overall cost of environmental regulation in the United States is estimated to be about 2% of the [[gross domestic product]]-similar to many other countries, but calculating the cost is challenging both conceptually (deciding what costs are included) and practically (with data from a broad range of sources).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pizer |first1=William A. |last2=Kopp |first2=Raymond J. |title=Calculating the Cost of Environmental Regulation |url=https://www.rff.org/publications/working-papers/calculating-the-cost-of-environmental-regulation |date=2003-02-28 |publisher=Resources for the Future |location=Washington, D.C. |id=Working Paper}}</ref> In 1994, almost $122 billion was spent on pollution abatement and control. $35 billion of that has been in direct government spending, $65 billion was spent by business, and $22 billion was spent by individuals.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Climate change policy of the United States]]\n* [[Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration#Climate change|Foreign policy of the Obama administration regarding Climate change]]\n* [[List of environmental agencies in the United States]]\n* [[List of United States federal environmental statutes]]\n* [[U.S. Climate Change Science Program]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Daynes, Byron W. and Glen Sussman.

Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], and she was educated privately at home. Her father ascended the throne on the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]] of his brother [[King Edward VIII]] in 1936, from which time she was the [[heir presumptive]]. She began to undertake public duties [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|during the Second World War]], serving in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]. In 1947, she married [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], a former prince of Greece and Denmark, with whom she has four children: [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]; [[Anne, Princess Royal]]; [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]; and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]].\n\nWhen her father died in February 1952, Elizabeth became [[head of the Commonwealth]] and [[queen regnant]] of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]], and [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]]. She has reigned as a [[constitutional monarch]] through major political changes, such as [[devolution in the United Kingdom]], Canadian [[patriation]], and the [[decolonisation of Africa]]. Between 1956 and 1992, the number of [[States headed by Elizabeth II|her realms]] varied as territories gained independence, and as realms, including South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (renamed [[Sri Lanka]]), became republics. Her many historic visits and meetings include a [[State visit of Elizabeth II to the Republic of Ireland|state visit to the Republic of Ireland]] and visits to or from five [[pope]]s. Significant events have included her [[Coronation of Elizabeth II|coronation in 1953]] and the celebrations of her [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver]], [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden]], and [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond]] [[Jubilee]]s in 1977, 2002, and 2012, respectively. In 2017, she became the first British monarch to reach a [[Sapphire Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Sapphire Jubilee]]. She is the [[List of British monarchs by longevity|longest-lived]] and [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|longest-reigning British monarch]]. She is the [[List of longest-reigning monarchs|longest-serving female head of state]] in world history, and the world's [[List of oldest living state leaders|oldest living monarch]], [[List of current reigning monarchs by length of reign|longest-reigning current monarch]], and [[Lists of state leaders by age|oldest]] and [[List of current state leaders by date of assumption of office|longest-serving current head of state]].\n\nElizabeth has occasionally faced [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican]] sentiments and press criticism of the [[British royal family|royal family]], in particular after the breakdown of her children's marriages, her ''[[Annus horribilis#Elizabeth II|annus horribilis]]'' in 1992, and the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales|death in 1997]] of her former daughter-in-law [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. However, in the United Kingdom, support for the monarchy has been and remains consistently high, as does her personal popularity.<!--e.g. Polls cited in \"Public perception and character\" section below: Ipsos MORI (2006 and 2012); Populus Ltd (2007); BBC (2007)-->\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Queen Elizabeth II 1929.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Elizabeth as a thoughtful-looking toddler with curly, fair hair|On the [[List of covers of Time magazine (1920s)#1929|cover]] of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']], April 1929]]\nElizabeth was born at 02:40 ([[GMT]]) on 21 April 1926, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, [[King George V]].

Although her birth generated public interest, she was not expected to become queen, as Edward was still young and likely to marry and have children of his own, who would precede Elizabeth in the line of succession.<ref>Bond, p. 8; Lacey, p. 76; Pimlott, p. 3</ref> When her grandfather died in 1936 and her uncle succeeded as Edward VIII, she became second in line to the throne, after her father.

{"title_page": "List of longest-running scripted U.S. primetime television series", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis is a list of the '''longest-running scripted [[prime time]] television series in the United States''', as measured by number of seasons. Only shows that have aired on a major broadcast network for seven or more seasons and at least 100 episodes are included. Those that moved to a cable network or syndication are noted below.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid darkgrey; background:#cfecec;\"\n|-\n|Series shaded in aqua are currently in production.\n|}<!--\n\nDO NOT add South Park. Comedy Central is NOT a \"major broadcast network\" as this article prescribes. Gain consensus on talk page to amend this. \n\nThis list of television programs is for things on Broadcast television only.  Not TV programs made by cable, satellite or subscription services. So no HBO, Comedy Central, FX, Showtime, Netflix, etc.   Please stop adding things like Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Archer, Walking Dead, South Park, etc.\n\nAlso please remember the programs:\n\n* must be prime time\n* must be scripted\n* must be on broadcast television.  \n\nThis also means No daytime soap-operas or talk shows or game shows. \n\nAlso, most shows (and all in production programs being made now) currently link to their respective wiki pages for the number of episodes in the show. This page should not generally be updated to update the number of programs that have aired anymore.   More than half the shows that aren't in production have been converted to the new method as well.   If you need to update the number of shows that have aired, please do so directly to the program show and not here. \n\nFor example, if you want to display the number of episodes for \"The Simpsons\", you would use the following code:\n\n{{Template parameter value|The Simpsons|Infobox television||num_episodes|}}\n\nReplace the name of the program as needed. \n\n-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;\" text-align:center;\"\n|- \"\n!

So no HBO, Comedy Central, FX, Showtime, Netflix, etc.   Please stop adding things like Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Archer, Walking Dead, South Park, etc.\n\nAlso please remember the programs:\n\n* must be prime time\n* must be scripted\n* must be on broadcast television.  \n\nThis also means No daytime soap-operas or talk shows or game shows. \n\nAlso, most shows (and all in production programs being made now) currently link to their respective wiki pages for the number of episodes in the show. This page should not generally be updated to update the number of programs that have aired anymore.   More than half the shows that aren't in production have been converted to the new method as well.
